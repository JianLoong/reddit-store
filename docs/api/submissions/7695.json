They've been best friends for over 30 years. He's always been a gossip, talking shit about their various acquaintances whenever they hung out.  I told her, \"If he's talking that way about your homies, makes you wonder what he says about you, huh?\"\n\nAnyway, before our wedding 15 years ago, I was under a lot of stress and I started smoking again.  My wife (then fiancee) was really upset and asked me to stop.  I said I would try.  I was doing my best, using patches, gum, etc, but I would still slip up on occasion.    \nA few weeks before our wedding, I was driving down the road and my phone rang.  It was my wife and she was livid.  Her friend 'Scott' was driving behind me and noticed that I was smoking. He called my wife immediately to rat me out.  Jennifer wouldn't talk to me for two days.\n\nFast forward to the wedding day.  Everything went fantastic! We had a great time.  A lot of the attendee's were staying at the same hotel.  \n\nAfter my wife and I returned to the hotel, I ducked outside to sneak a cigarette.  As I was standing there, who should sneak up...but Scott.  \"I see you,\" he sing-songed at me, presenting me with a shit eating grin.\n\nI pretended not to hear him, put out my cigarette and went back to my room.\n\nBy the time I got there (2 minutes) my wife was furious.  Scott had called her immediately to let her know that he had seen me smoking and she was waiting for me at the door when I returned.\n\nShe yelled at me for an hour and wouldn't speak to me afterward, telling me I had ruined our wedding night.  \n\nFlash forward 15 years.  Scott is marrying his partner, and my wife wants me to go to his wedding with her.  I absolutely refuse.  It's burned me for years that his need for drama ruined our wedding night.  He could have easily held onto his 'dirt' until the next day, but he couldn't wait to spread the news, upsetting his BFF.\n\nI have no desire to attend this guys wedding.  All I can think about his need to rat me out to my wife on our first night as husband and wife.  It still pisses me off.\n\nMy wife is upset at me and says that since I was the one lying (about my smoking) that I had no right to be upset with Scott, and that I need to get over it.  My argument back is I was addicted to cigarettes, and I was doing my best to stop.  Her friend took great glee in creating drama on her wedding night and relished the fact that he was creating trouble for me.\n\nI am holding firm.  \n\nAITA for refusing to attend the wedding of this person?", "created_utc": 1674086197, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fmk0w/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_wifes_bfs_wedding/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt this will be the majority opinion, but I fucking despise people like Scott.\n\nIntentionally starting shit, shit talking, etc is such a huge character flaw compared to being stressed and sneaking off for a cigarette on your wedding. Even if you classified it as lying. \n\n Also your wife seems overly dramatic(which is why she and Scott are best friends I bet)... you smoking a cigarette ruined the wedding?!?", "Strictly on the question you asked, NTA. If you don't want to go you don't have to. \n\nBut lying and sneaking cigarettes is entirely on you, not him. Obviously it's a huge deal to her. If my partner was sneaking around doing something I considered nearly a deal breaker, I'd want my friends to tell me. His loyalty as a friend was to her, not to you or your secrecy.", "ESH\n\nYou blaming the dude for your mistakes. He being a no good rat. Your wife having an entirely out of proportion reaction to smoking. All suck.", "Honestly, didn't even read this.

Yes not ideal to be smoking , but all those judging you I can guarantee were never smokers and don\u2019t realise the difficulties and failures in quitting , if so easy no would be smoking now .\n\nAs for that guy he is a pure dick , you were not cheating on her with another person , you were having a cigarette, he knew how she would react and ran with glee to tell her , you are correct he tried to ruin and sabotage your wedding , I certainly would not want to go to his\u2026\n\nSurprised you didn\u2019t deck him at the time .", "NTA, and I\u2019m disturbed by this dynamic he and your wife have going on. He rats you out and she chews your ass for an hour? I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re an adult, and quitting smoking is hard. No one deserves to have to sit there for an hour and be chewed out or to get the SILENT TREATMENT for two *days*.

Do you have get togethers with him, or does she only see him without you present? Has he ever apologized? My judgment depends on these answers.\n\nEdit: Ok, with your answers, I\u2019m going to say NTA (but you skated really close to the E S H line, especially smoking on your wedding night). Scott sounds like a drama king, and he just couldn\u2019t wait to disrupt your wife\u2019s happiness on her wedding day. What kind of BFF does that? A toxic one. Your wife also kinda sucks here for screaming at you every time he tattled. I could understand her wanting a strong discussion, but yelling for an hour on your wedding night? What she should have done is tell Scott to mind his own business. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go to his wedding.

He ruined your wedding night. Screw that guy.", "NTA at all. Tell your wife just the thought of seeing that shit disturber makes you want to take up smoking again. He\u2019s an ass.", "NTA.

The fact he told her that night is that he just wanted drama and had no good intentions.", "NTA. if i may repeat what i read a lot on this thread over and over..

I know about myself that I cannot be around cigarette smoke, therefore I will do anything to avoid being around it, including not dating people who smoke or have smoked. I don\u2019t have a verdict, but I just, if it matters to you that much then it matters to you that much *all* the time, not just some of the time.

Honestly, your wife comes out of that looking abusive as well... \n\n\"She yelled at me for an hour and wouldn't speak to me afterward\"\n\n\"Jennifer wouldn't talk to me for two days.\"\n\nThat does not sound like a healthy relationship at all. If she still treats you like that every time she is upset... I would suggest couples therapy.", "ESH. Your wife and her best friend clearly love creating drama and overreacting to it. Those are very frustrating characteristics, and choosing not to turn it off even on your literal wedding day is super shitty. He knew what he was doing, she flew off the handle, that sucks. But honestly you\u2019re also kind of playing into it. You\u2019re pissed off at this dude 15 years after the fact for telling his lifelong best friend that her partner was lying to her. Even if the way he did it sucks - a lot - the core of it is not a wrong thing to do, and YOU were the one doing something you swore you weren\u2019t doing. Your wife would\u2019ve smelled smoke on you.

I get why you don't like the guy who clearly is a gossip and shit stirrer. But I'm sensing a lot of immaturity in your post. You are responsible for your action of smoking when you knew it could ruin your wedding night. You knew the hotel was crawling with wedding guests who could spill the beans, even accidentally, to your wife. Hell, your wife could have stepped outside and seen you herself. That's on you. Now, if you find this guy's personality so grating that you will be annoyed and unhappy during the wedding, don't go.

You because you shouldn\u2019t have lied and tried to hide it, and also for holding grudges for 15 years! Were you waiting for his wedding to pull this petty thing? But anyway, it\u2019s your choice.

You and Scott are both AH, but you\u2019re a bigger one", "ESH probably don't lie to your fiancee.", "NTA\n\nScott did nothing more than stir up shit, potentially for his own amusement (some people just live for drama). I wouldn't go to the wedding, either.\n\nAs for your wife and the smoking stuff, well... Smoking is an addiction. You can say you are quitting an addiction and have lapses. You can be quitting an addiction by slowly phasing it out. What your wife was clearly wanting was for you to go immediately cold turkey, which can actually be more harmful when quitting an addiction of this sort. It can also lead to much bigger relapses in the future than if you quit by phasing it out. And if that is how your wife reacts to finding out about you having a cigarette, then no wonder you tried to be sneaky.\n\nI think Scott needs to mind his fucking business, and your wife needs to be more understanding of how difficult and stressful quitting an addiction can be. Not the asshole.", "YTA. You are letting him create even more drama for you. Just go as her plus one and enjoy a free meal at his expense.  Also, your wife would have known you snuck a cigarette anyway. The smell of cigarette smoke lingers on you. So the drama would have happened anyway.", "Nta I feel like alot of ppl don't understand addiction, how much it consumes and changes people. Tbh this post doesn't paint your wife in a good light. Yelling at you? \nI wouldn't want to go to the wedding of a guy I have a grudge against either. Your issues as a couple wasn't any of his business.

You are not seeing eye to eye.", "YTA - i like how you can make mistakes (smoking) and Scott (gossiping) cant. This was FIFTEEN years ago. This is petty.", "YTA. I guess I don't blame you for not liking the guy (even if you're holding onto ancient history at this point, and even if you did kind of bring it on yourself by sneaking around and doing things behind your wife's back) but can't you just go because your wife wants you to? \n\nLook at it as something you're doing for her, not him.", "NTA, but I am so petty, I would say, \"you know, you're right. I SHOULD go to the wedding!\" with a manipulative gleam in my eye.

YTA not him", "I'm gonna say YTA. The smoking thing you were trying your best to stop and the dude was a dick about it (and wife not understanding). However, you are in this committed relationship with her. If it were you alone, I'd say you can absolutely skip out. Since it is your life partner's bf, I feel you should go to support her. Tbh, that dude's gonna be so busy, you probably won't have to see him that much.", "YTA. You were being dishonest to her, and you're mad because he exposed you. It sounds like you still can't take responsibility for that. He shouldn't have said anything on your wedding day, I agree with that. But it's been 15 YEARS. \n\nIt sounds like you going to the wedding means a lot to her. Maybe that should mean more to you than a pretty minor grievance that's a decade and a half old. If you go, you'll probably barely have to interact with him.", "YTA, as this refusal is based on you blaming him for having to face the consequences of your own actions. Take some responsibility for yourself.", "YTA.

How your wife reacted (which sounds like it was addressed in therapy, good for both of you because it wasn't okay.)\n2. You trying to lie, sneak, and hide things you knew would upset your wife, and still to this day blame someone else for ruining your wedding night. Scott would have had nothing to report if you weren't trying to hide and lie. And from your comments it comes across like you still mainly blame him. \n\nYou need to get over yourself a little here. He's important to your wife. He isn't going away even if he moved, it sounds like they are still important to each other. You don't have to like him.

I'd vote ESH.", "I dunno, I feel like lying to your wife is pretty hurtful.", "And one could argue that this was a decade and a half ago and OP needs to get over it.", "Not even that. He could have told the next day. No need to be a dick and start a fight the wedding night.", "Then you shouldn't have snuck out on your wedding night to break your new wife's trust.", "What time were you ready ? The first time you got caught by and lied to your wife ? Or like the 3rd", "If you lose your wife, that might be harder. Then again, we don't know her, maybe it would be easier who knows.", "idk, been around a few people with a keen sense of smell and, due to my desire to keep them from having to smell smoke on me (out of courtesy).. they haven't.\n\nmy own mother asked me how I hide the smell as well as I do, and she loathes that I smoke.\n\nit's not likely, but it's doable.", "Oh fucking please, we're talking about a cigarette, not fucking the maid of honour or a bridesmaid or some shit.", "He was literally trying to stop, I\u2019m sure people like you are oh so perfect you don\u2019t struggle to give up addictive substances without a few blips along the way. Point was *he was trying* and from the way he\u2019s phrased it in his post it seems like he succeeded", "This guy virtue signals.", "[deleted]", "Your analogy breaks down because his smoking affects her health as well. Does a donut expose your partner to second-hand sprinkles?", "It sounds like OP started smoking again in the lead up to the wedding. And smoking is a deal breaker for a lot of people, and obviously wife wasn't excited to be with a smoker. OP is lucky she didn't call off the wedding. I would have at least delayed it until OP had fully quit because I wouldn't want to be married to a smoker. Calling the wife a nag for wanting him to stop a bad habit she doesn't want to live with and that he started up on just before the wedding is wild", "Exactly! He\u2019s a grown ass man. Who is she to make this decision for him? Plus he was trying to quit", "Dude, this was 15 years ago and he doesn\u2019t smoke anymore. And I guess you missed his comments about how he sucked for what he did. But Scott didn\u2019t tell out of concern - concern would have been the next day. He told for no other reason than to cause drama and turmoil.", "IDK.    \nI admitted it was wrong then, and I still do now.", "He said that he would tell her that he slipped up. So the BFF wanted to stir the pot. \nAnd quiting smoking is a beast to do.", "Oh ffs.", "Thanks!  \nMy wife and I have both matured.  We have had communication issues along the way, so we go to a couples therapist a few times a year for 'check ins'.  \nI find them pretty useful.", "It was a stressful day and I was physically addicted.  \nNot my greatest moment, but I still think Scott went out of his way to fuck me over.", "I still smoke and even I can still smell it strongly if my SO has a smoke and I don\u2019t.", "Having a hard time understand this aren't ya.\n\nHe didn't tell a lie. Scott talked to the wife before he did both times. He didn't get to tell her anything, lie or truth.", "My wife and I have our ups and downs.  \nShe's incredibly strong willed and knows what she likes and what she doesn't like.  \nI'm more reserved.  \nWe have had communication issues in the past but we do couples therapy a couple times a year to 'check in'.", "Maybe I misunderstood. I thought in the post OP said something like he agreed to do his best to quit but admitted he may slip up. It sounds like getting caught in the car and after their wedding were the anticipated slip ups he mentioned. Is the expectation that he call his wife to disclose each lapse in resolve cigarette while he tries to quit? Not doing so is considered lying?", "I told her I was going to get luggage out of the car.", "My wife isn't going anywhere. Neither am I.", "Do you open-mouth kiss any of those people?  You can't hide that from someone with whom you are being intimate.", "Exactly. He wasn\u2019t smoking heroin. Or Meth. It was a cigarette\u2026", "Then tell your wife you're trying and explain why it's so difficult to stop. If she doesn't get that, does she have empathy for you? If not, shouldn't you know that before your wedding night? If he lied because he knew she'd flip out unreasonably, that also says a lot. Still doesn't justify the lying though.", "This", "Chill with the nasty tone. I understand quitting isn\u2019t easy. But the problem is that he was doing it behind her back, not necessarily that he\u2019s doing it. The lying is the issue. And then him being all baffled and stumped as to why she\u2019s upset with him. She\u2019s upset because he was lying \n\nHe even says that afterwards he started telling her whenever he slipped up. Since he doesn\u2019t say that she freaked out at those instances, I assume she was more understanding whenever he came forward to her about it. I could be wrong, but that\u2019s how the situation reads to me. So if only he hadn\u2019t tried to lie on their freaking. Wedding. Night. If you can\u2019t see why she would\u2019ve been upset, then I feel sorry", "As the child of smokers, it definitely harms more than just yourself. Second hand smoke is considerably worse than actually smoking, and it's non-consentual. Not to mention the impact it has on people around you in other ways - it gets into the cloth in your house (clothing, bed linens, curtains, towels), the smell is almost impossible to get rid of or to get out of things, and sometimes the monetary aspect of it affects people too (though this one isn't always true).\n\nAs long as OP is genuinely trying to quit, they're not the AH for their wedding night, because it's a stressful situation and whilst I would have been unhappy if I were the bride, I'd have understood (even if only eventually). However, OP needs to have a talk with wife's BFF about this and all 3 adults need to have a talk as well about boundaries and gossip.", "If my husband died of lung cancer I would consider myself \"harmed.\"  I would also consider myself \"harmed\" if I was regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, and if I had to deal with the disgusting smell of cigarettes on my husband's clothes and breath.  I certainly wouldn't want to start my honeymoon like that, and she probably would have noticed the smell anyway.  \n\nAlso the main concern with addiction should be the harm it is causing to your loved one, not whether or not they are breaking the law.  I understand people relapse when they have an addiction but covering up the behavior and lying so you can keep on doing it is not ok.", "So wife should just accept having the burden to care for OP once his health goes to shit because of something entirely preventable? Smoking kills, and it doesn\u2019t only affect the smoker", "How did his smoking not around her effect her health?  I mean since he was hiding it from her, it\u2019s not like she was getting second hand smoke.", "Except you blame this dude for what happened. When it was your fault.\n\nDon't get me wrong, dude's a dick. But it seems like you are shifting the blame entirely onto him this schmuck.", "He said he started telling her AFTER this incident. He was \"sneaking\" before. Putting that in quotes because there is no sneaking cigarettes. That shit stinks. Everybody knows.", "Nice! I think you are smart to want to stay well away from this Scott guy, and you don\u2019t want the three of you present in the same place to snap your wife back into some old, unhealthy dynamics.", "[deleted]", "She still deserves to know the shit you pulled on your wedding night, of all nights", "It wasn't his job to hide your shitty behavior.  His loyalty is to his friend, not you.  It was your actions that ruined the night, not his.", "When I smoked, I knew I smelled some, but I didn\u2019t think BAD. After I quit, it\u2019s ALL bad.", "He mentioned in a comment telling his wife he was going to go get luggage he didn\u2019t say he was gonna have a quick cigarette so it\u2019s kind of a lie", "In a couple comments, OP says that he told his new wife that he was going to take the luggage out of the car, and says she never would have noticed that he'd been smoking. It's clear he intended to deliberately hide it. It'd be different if he'd been planning on fessing up.", "Yes. Exactly. You deliberately lied. And then got upset when you faced the consequences of your actions. Sounds like Scott was looking out for his friend. Whether or not him talking shit about others is appropriate is totally irrelevant. You are holding on to a grudge that only happened of your own doing. Get over it. How would you feel if your wife refused to interact with someone you've been best friends with for 30 years?", "Exactly. Just a few hours married, and you're already lying to her.", "Ewww. A double lie? I\u2019m wondering if I should switch from ESH to YTA.", "I don\u2019t know why your wife decided to remain married to a liar.", "Good! Then stop smoking, because if she thinks it's a dealbreaker, it's a dealbreaker.", "yes, I regularly kiss my mother, friends, and SO with an open mouth without any mitigating factors after smoking a cigarette.", "Incorrect", "He did tell his wife he would try and quit, though.", "I agree, but. totally curious, what's your opinion on the wife's friend ratting him out?\n\nis that cool? on my wedding night I'd personally rather not know.", "[deleted]", "Third hand smoke is a thing and caring for a husband with lung cancer will effect her health as well", "No.    \nI smoked and fucked up (so glad I don't smoke anymore).

Are you supposed to report to your wife when your buddy offers you a bump on your wedding night too? \n\nThis sub sometimes\u2026", "Jesus Christ it\u2019s a cigarette not a needle.", "He wasn't looking out for his friend. \n\nTruthfully put yourself in Scott shoes. You catch your best friend new husband of 1 hour smoking after he said he quit.  Are you telling her during the middle of her wedding? \n\nI think most people would know this is something she should know but to tell her after the wedding so she won't have a sour memory.  This guy told in 2 min because he loves the drama.  That's not a friend", "Scott was not looking out for his friend.  Unless there is a true emergency, there is absolutely no reason to interrupt ur friends wedding night. I mean seriously, to interrupt ur supposed BFF's wedding night with petty gossip that cld be told the next day tells me a u don't care Abt ur BFF only the pleasure u get from causing drama.", ">How would you feel if your wife refused to interact with someone you've been best friends with for 30 years?\n\nI'd be fine with with it.", "Honestly, I thought YTA before we even got this detail.", "This is so wrong on so many levels - the reasoning, the science...all wrong. \n\nSounds like someone is trying to justify their own smoking habit", "Are you absolutely sure your wife didn\u2019t *ask* Scott to tell her if he saw you smoking?", "Most of the time? Do you lied to her and then continued to lie to her about your smoking. Good job.", "Maybe he did. Maybe he just doesn't like you for whatever reason.\n\nBut the reality is that he wouldn't have been able to screw you over at all without your own actions.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't go to the dude's wedding since the two of you clearly don't get on. You'd be doing yourself, him and even your wife a disservice.", "As a general rule, it's not the job of your partner's friends to keep your dirty secrets so you don't get in trouble for lying to your partner.", "Maybe he wanted to screw you over or maybe his loyalty lies with his best friend. It was clearly important to her that you don\u2019t smoke and when he caught you, he felt he owed it to her to tell. Honestly, he shouldn\u2019t have told her the day of your wedding, since she was under enough stress. That was AH behavior for sure.\n\nI\u2019m voting ESH because this was over 15 years ago and you\u2019re still heated about it. He didn\u2019t owe you loyalty.. And he was a dirty dick for telling her at your wedding. And your wife went super ballistic at your wedding. I think you should support your wife and attend the wedding because you really should be over this grudge unless you have a recent example of him being an AH.", "Personally I also wouldn't want to have anything to do with a guy like \"Scott\".  \\[And ignore the holier-than-thou comments! :) \\]", "Lol right? Like if telling the wife was sOoOoOo important, and you know it\u2019s going to cause a fight, don\u2019t tell her on her wedding night *unless you want to start a fight*. It\u2019s hardly time sensitive.", "Um yes?!  If you can't be honest about your substance use with your wife, and you are more honest with your friends, you shouldn't be getting married.  And whether recreational drug use/smoking/drinking is ok in your relationship is something you should be on the same page about either way.  \n\nThe \"hiding bad habits from the nagging wife\" trope is getting old.  Plenty of women would happily partake too, and plenty of men would be angry if their wife was doing drugs on their wedding night.  They just  wouldn't make a good match.", "You don\u2019t see any problem with his dishonesty and backhandedness on their wedding night? He knows she doesn\u2019t like it, and still proceeds to do it the night of their wedding. No wonder she was upset", "Not only that but she would know as soon as he got back to the room. \n\nSmoking stinks. We know it. If you are going to hide a cigarette you need a shower, toothbrush and change of clothes. \n\nScott intentionally caused issues on his best friends wedding night.", "People are saying OP started his marriage based on lies,but he didn\u2019t even have a chance to speak about it because this Messy Marty felt it necessary to call and tattle. He acts like OP was caught with a dick in his mouth. \n\nQuitting cigarettes is hard. BUT slipping up with a cigarette is not as big of a deal as people make it.", "He could\u2019ve waited until after the honeymoon if he felt like he needed to say something, not like he caught him with a crack pipe.

You'd be doing yourself, him and even your wife a disservice.\n\nAgreed.", "I think the wife knew he was trying to quit, emphasis on trying. He screwed up his own goal of quitting, and probably felt bad about it himself. Expecting someone to quit cold turkey is weird to me- there\u2019s so much research on how difficult it is & how many times people attempt it & relapse. It\u2019s hard for me to consider something like that a lie in the sense that he had no chance to come clean himself? Like wife would obviously smell it on him if he didn\u2019t tell her in the next two minutes- let this couple manage their issues themselves on their wedding night of all nights.", ">he didn\u2019t even have a chance to speak about it \n\nHe lied before Scott even saw him: he told his wife he was going get some luggage in order to sneak a cigarette. \n\nSlipping up isn't what everyone is mad about. The problem is that he was lying, and kept lying until he got caught one too many times.", "God damn it feels good to see someone taking accountability on this sub", "Sorry my last comment wasn\u2019t as clear as i thought it was. I don\u2019t have as much of an issue with him slipping up, but moreso with the fact that he did it behind her back and tried to hide it. And then blames it on the other guy for his wife being upset instead of taking accountability for his lies. Even if she would\u2019ve smelled it on him, that\u2019s a really lame defense\n\nI think his secrecy is what bothers his wife too. He did say that he started just telling her whenever he smoked. So I\u2019m assuming with the lack of description of her reaction, she was understanding when he was honest compared to when he wasn\u2019t. Again, sorry that i didn\u2019t clarify that it was him lying to his wife on their wedding night that was the issue, in addition to the smoking (since wife doesn\u2019t like it)", "I guess I\u2019m just thinking he didn\u2019t even have the time to tell her before the friend did. Fair enough had he bought a pack fully intending to smoke all throughout the wedding & deliberately wanted to hide it. Less fair if he hadn\u2019t touched one in awhile & upon seeing his old buddies he got weak & they offered him one."]}
