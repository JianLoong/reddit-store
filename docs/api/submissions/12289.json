This is because I am ginger, my husband is blonde but our baby came out with dark hair. He freaked out in the delivery room and his behavior got him kicked out the hospital. I had to beg him to do a paternity test and he finally agreed after a month, and it proved that I didn't cheat. We had been together since we were 13 so I was devastated and all I wanted was him back, but I've come to my senses and decided that someone who believes that school level punnet squares are the be all and end all of biological inheritance is not the type of person I wanna be with. I was also treated like crap by everyone but my older brother, Alex, while we were waiting for the results because they all thought I had cheated. It was a horrible experience and as a result, I've lost many friends and family members. \n\nSince the results came back, my ex has been begging me to get back with him. I moved in with Alex after we split, and he comes almost everyday to beg me to get back with him. My in laws have also been harassing me too, especially my MIL who has come over four times in the past week asking me to forgive her son and to 'let God back into my heart'. I used to be a Christian and so are all my in laws and my family, but how I was treated when my baby was born made me lose faith fast. The whole church community treated me like trash during this whole ordeal and it made me want nothing to do with them anymore and I don't want to raise my son in that sort of community.\n\nYesterday, my MIL turned up to Alex's when he wasn't here, and she had the pastor from the church I used to attend with them. They practically forced their way in, and I was being berated like a child for not forgiving my ex's 'lapse in judgement'. The pastor basically sat there and said I would be going to hell if I didn't take my ex back. I excused myself to use the bathroom, and called the police. Pastor and MIL were escorted out. \n\nNow, I'm being harassed on social media and being called and texted by literally everyone that knows both me and my ex and his family. They're calling me the AH for going nuclear and calling the police on two people who weren't being threatening and they're demanding that I apologise immediately. I'm starting to feel bad now because I know they care in their own twisted way and I shouldn't have gone nuclear on them.

I am going to paraphrase this based on *my own beliefs,* so bear with me.\n\nWhen you made those vows before your god and the universe, your god wasn't the only one watching.

If your husband questioned the paternity of his child, he could have stayed calm and asked for a paternity test, or just gotten one on his own. Even if he lost is cool in the moment, his family and friends could have quickly calmed him and told him to get a test, all the while being polite to you, and just stayed fully neutral until the results were in. Instead, everyone acted in the worst ways, which is particularly terrible considering how long you two have been together. If I had a friend that doubted paternity, I'd tell them to keep their mouth shut and get a test, take it from there. \n\nThese people all went nuclear, so now you need to get out and stay out. To do this, now is the time to fully protect yourself:\n\n1. Get a ring camera.\n2. Be careful leaving the home by yourself. \n3. Keep all text messages and other written conversation where people treated you badly.\n4. Try to get a statement from the nurse about how they got kicked out of the hospital\n5.

Not the best move.  It is within your rights if they refuse to leave after you tell them, but definitely more nuclear than was probably warranted.

This is because I am ginger, my husband is blonde but our baby came out with dark hair. He freaked out in the delivery room and his behavior got him kicked out the hospital. I had to beg him to do a paternity test and he finally agreed after a month, and it proved that I didn't cheat. We had been together since we were 13 so I was devastated and all I wanted was him back, but I've come to my senses and decided that someone who believes that school level punnet squares are the be all and end all of biological inheritance is not the type of person I wanna be with. I was also treated like crap by everyone but my older brother, Alex, while we were waiting for the results because they all thought I had cheated. It was a horrible experience and as a result, I've lost many friends and family members. \n\nSince the results came back, my ex has been begging me to get back with him. I moved in with Alex after we split, and he comes almost everyday to beg me to get back with him. My in laws have also been harassing me too, especially my MIL who has come over four times in the past week asking me to forgive her son and to 'let God back into my heart'. I used to be a Christian and so are all my in laws and my family, but how I was treated when my baby was born made me lose faith fast. The whole church community treated me like trash during this whole ordeal and it made me want nothing to do with them anymore and I don't want to raise my son in that sort of community.\n\nYesterday, my MIL turned up to Alex's when he wasn't here, and she had the pastor from the church I used to attend with them. They practically forced their way in, and I was being berated like a child for not forgiving my ex's 'lapse in judgement'. The pastor basically sat there and said I would be going to hell if I didn't take my ex back. I excused myself to use the bathroom, and called the police. Pastor and MIL were escorted out. \n\nNow, I'm being harassed on social media and being called and texted by literally everyone that knows both me and my ex and his family. They're calling me the AH for going nuclear and calling the police on two people who weren't being threatening and they're demanding that I apologise immediately. I'm starting to feel bad now because I know they care in their own twisted way and I shouldn't have gone nuclear on them. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Do they think that kind of accusation should just be casually forgotten? It was not a \"lapse in judgement\". If they are serious about honoring the Commandments, they should be just as serious about false accusations of breaking them.\n\nI don't know your husband, and this may be in character for him, but it seems weird that he went nuclear in the delivery room. It's hard to tell anything about hair color when the baby is still wet and slimy from being born. Do you think it's possible that someone (or several someones) planted the idea in his head before the birth and that primed him to freak out?

This is absolutely insane and I'm glad you escaped both circumstances (your ex and the church community). Now you need to be firm with your boundaries. Stop answering phone calls and the door. If people won't leave, call the cops again. This is harassment and the reason why it's happening makes it all so much worse. I'm sorry you're going through this OP", "Absolutely NTA. \nYou may want to sit down with your ex and lay down some demands. Explain to him that you are not obligated to forgive him and he cannot demand you to go back with him. You have a child to think of and the well-being and security of your child comes before anything else. Including his feelings. \nIt baffles me how the people that are quick to judge and say they want nothing to do with you will practically demand you leave them alone, but when the tables turn they completely disregard your wishes. Your ex was caught off guard and reacted poorly. While the circumstances suck it is not the issue. The issue is that he took it as a given that you cheated. He was convinced that you betrayed him even though you were willing to prove yourself with a paternity test. By all accounts his behavior is a betrayal because it was easier for him to accept you cheating then to hear your side. He did not trust you, he turned his back on you, and refused to hear you out. I\u2019m not saying that you guys can\u2019t work through this. But the audacity of him to expect you to just forgive and forget his betrayal is mind blowing. He needs to give you space and respect the fact that you may not want to see him right now. \nHis mother harassing you and bringing a pastor is also concerning. It shows that even when you have proven to be \u201cinnocent\u201d they will disregard your wishes and are willing to bully you into submission. I wonder if MIL was this insistent with her son to forgive you when he thought you cheated? My guess is no. This is no longer her concern. Except for Alex, you were alone after your ex\u2019s accusations. You are a mother looking out for your child. If anyone tries to threaten, intimidate, or even harass you call the police right away. Never apologize for ensuring your safety or your child\u2019s safety. \nThis is a crucial time for you and your ex to determine a healthy co-parenting relationship. In my opinion, not only does he need to earn your forgiveness and trust back, but he also needs to put an immediate stop to the backlash you are facing. This all started because of him. He made the mess and he needs to clean it up. He needs to understand that he already failed you once. If he allows others to harass you he will be failing you again as well as his child.\nAs far as everyone else, well they have shown their true colors and opinions of you. So much for \u201che who is without sin cast the first stone\u201d.\nWishing you the best of luck and congratulations on your new baby!", "NTA and you should be looking into keeping the STBex / fam away from your kid.", "Nta. \n\nYou know why they\u2019re mad?\n\nYou took away a piece of their power. And good for you!\n\nDouble down love. Let them know that YES. You are going to call the cops every single time someone has the audacity to break into your home while you\u2019re alone with your little baby. \n\nTake their emotional torture tools away. \n\nAnd anyone who doesn\u2019t like it? Well. They made their choices. Blocked and banned.", "ESH, but OP is a much milder case than the ex and his family. \"they practically forced their way in\" sounds to me like OP or her brother reluctantly allowed in people who were being pushy, not people who \"actually\" forced their way in. If OP told them to leave and they refused, it would have been completely appropriate to call the police. But instead she bowed out to the bathroom or whatever and called the police on them without giving them the chance to leave on their own. They're also technically not trespassers until told to leave (or refused entry in the first place, which doesn't sound like what happened). \n\nI can understand why OP made that decision. the situation sucks and she was treated very unfairly, so I don't blame her for wanting to be more passive. But I don't see any allegations that she felt like she'd be in danger if she told them to leave without law enforcement around. In fact she said the opposite, that they weren't being threatening.

The one thing I wish my mom had done differently was not raise me in the church. Every other difficulty of being the child of a single parent would have been ok if it hadn't been for the endlessly traumatizing presence of the church in our lives.
