I haven\u2019t bought new clothes in a year. My car is used. Since the divorce, I\u2019ve cut my hair and my kids hair to save money, even. \n\nSometimes we get UberEats though, if you want to argue I should never have anything for myself.", "It\u2019s theft to hold men accountable and make them contribute to the raising of their children\u2026riiiiight\u2026", "If she\u2019s busy raising your children, I think you pretty much owe her a fresh mani. It\u2019s the absolute least you can do.", "If you think the US child support system is flawed you\u2019ve never actually had any experience with the court system.", "So how it works is I filed and submitted a financial statement. He will have to answer and file is financial statement. There will be a hearing before a judge where my ex can plead his case for reduced support, and a judge will set the support amount.", "Not to sound crappy, but why does the wife not work? A bulk of the time, the stay at home parent is home because daycare is too expensive when you have multiple kids too young for school. Literally all of these kids are school aged. If they can\u2019t afford a house and child support why is she not working? One spouse should only be home so long as it financially makes sense for the family.", "If that is the case then I would say do not agree to the reduction. This was court ordered and determined based on the time they spend with you and honestly while it is more I would suspect is nowhere near what you currently spend for the kids proportionally speaking. \n\nSeparately did the kids you share go to the Disney and universal vacation?", "Umm. There is no reason she cannot work if they are that old.\n\nNTA. But he is for not telling her if she wants to live where she does she gas yo help pay in.  So yeah don't let him pay less. Hopefully the judge gives a good amount as the 2000 I think is fair honestly as is their medical.", "Slightest effort will get you almost nothing from what I have seen.  A hell of an effort you are looking at getting maybe 30-40% custody if your lucky if the wife wants more custody and you got a damn good lawyer.  50% is really only possible when the wife agrees to it.  A lot of it comes down to the judge and their feelings.  It\u2019s pretty crazy shit in family court.  Have a buddy in Nashville that got a very notorious anti father judge that basically does shit when the mom refuses to turn over the kids for his time.  He eventually got the case reassigned by finally handing over what little savings he had for a high end lawyer.  Still has issues with her and they still won\u2019t give him more custody.  It\u2019s crazy shit out there.", "Definite troll, he's all over AITA today being contrarian, racking up downvotes on purpose.", "[deleted]", "Good on him to adopt BUT adopting a kid is NOT CHEAP!! He doesn\u2019t seem financially responsible. He\u2019s spending beyond his means", "They did go, and sent me tons of pictures!", "If she has $$ left over from her own paycheck she shouldn't be able to spend it how she wants once the kids expenses are taken care of? That does not sound healthy at all.", "Custody arrangements and CS are separate issues.  Courts will tell you that.  It puts a barrier between those who withhold the kids from the other parent because they think they should get more money and the other end of the spectrum with the parents who want more time just to reduce support.  \n\nOP should definitely put her hands up and tell him that the courts will figure it out.  Also, I know you said you can't afford it u/NoIDontThinkIShall, but see if you can get a lawyer to work with you on payments.  If he has a lawyer and you don't, you likely will get royally screwed.", "He could try, but the agreement has all the appropriate legalese to make that very difficult", "They're separate issues for the court to determine but there are many cases where the arguments on the custody arrangement actually stem from child support concerns. A good lawyer wouldn't make a change on custody without getting the child support situation agreed to as well.", "For factual purposes, we live in a state where child support is increased when there are financial responsibilities involving school. I agreed not to recalculate child support to encompass those expenses, as he would not consent to enrolling the kids if he had to pay for it in any way. \n\nSo, despite receiving appropriate child support for the kids normal expenses, he does not pay anything for his share of educational expenses. \n\nFor our new child support agreement, I am still not asking him to pay toward their education; only their regular expenses.", "If you were not receiving child support at all, would that make your decision to send your children to private school any different?", "Absolutely. If he did not pay his appropriate share of their living expenses, my disposable income would decrease. That seems obvious"]}
