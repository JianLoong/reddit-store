She's living in her means, paying to ensure her children get the education they need and working to provide for them. Meanwhile the ex has a wife who stays at home when they clearly can't afford all the goodies they want like a big house, two cars and holidays. Plus the two boys won't be staying as much with the ex anymore. Why should the ex pay less? Either cut down on your treats or have his wife work. The OP could actually have the ex be paying for the boys' schooling if she wanted.", "He is the one that is mad because he clearly can\u2019t afford to pay what he owes.  If you can\u2019t afford your child support then you need to cut back on some of your luxuries. OP shouldn\u2019t have to to sacrifice because he is unwilling to sacrifice himself.", "My dude, I am a ball of anxiety who literally hyperfocuses on making the best possible choice in every situation. So yeah, I guess I did need to hear that I\u2019m not being an asshole.", "He had the responsibility to take care of these two children before he took on five more.   Those two children were his responsibility as of the divorce, so, yes, they take priority over the children he chose to have knowing that he was on tap for child support.", "Why should OP's kids get less support because their father's new wife doesn't want to work to support her own kids?", "Then you are pretty clearly NTA.", "You can consult a divorce attorney. \n\nYou can afford one. He will just have to pay for YOUR attorney himself. That's how it works. If there is such asymmetry in income. One of the parties pays for both attorneys. \n\nAt least, that's how it worked in California for one of my family members.", "Indeed! We know the legal system has a lot of bias built in to it, but generally these situations are of the fathers own creation. Want your wife to stay home for 10 years birthing and raising your offspring because you work absurd hours to build your career? Great, either the hours gotta be reduced, or you\u2019re not getting as much time with your kids, bud. That\u2019s just reality.", "Unfortunately, is it the same if the kid is from kinship care. From what I've heard they get less help.", "Also most judges and law firm partners are male, so?", "In Idaho, we get the same help as Foster and Foster to adopt parents.", "NTA. It is not your fault that he is now living above his means. He is obligated to help care for the kids you share. If it is going to hurt his finances that bad, he should have his wife get a job to help out with their household bills", "NTA\n\nSound like he needs to budget a little better.", "Dave Foley tells a tale in which a judge once told him that his ability to pay $17 grand a month child support has no bearing on his obligation to do so.", "NTA it sounds like you and your partner are responsible and budget your money and he bought a house he couldn\u2019t afford.", "NTA. The financial background isn\u2019t necessary to add to the equation. You are not doing anything to him, he is paying what the courts decide he is legally liable for. \n\nYou make sacrifices to provide your children with the things they need. He is also their parent, and it isn\u2019t unreasonable for him to do that also.", "NTA.  You are already paying for the schooling on your own. He can pay what the court ordered. If you were making more money than him, or were refusing to work to your capabilities, I would say maybe. But you are doing all you can to give your kids a good education. It is not your fault that he has taken on so much debt load.  He can do what the court ordered.", "NTA", "NTA- I was married in my early twenties and had a child. We divorced when our child was 4, and he didn\u2019t pay child support until child was 10. I honestly fell for the whole \u2018I don\u2019t have the financial means to pay child support\u2019. Trust me- everyone I know kept telling me to take him to court to get payments. I never would, I felt guilty for some reason. But everything changed when said child needed braces. I was able to pay $4,000 up front and took out a loan for the remainder (child had some extreme orthodontic issues) times were tough and many months I didn\u2019t know how I was going to make that payment, but I did\u2026until the third to last payment. I just didn\u2019t have it. I texted my ex and asked for anything- $20, even, to help out. He claimed he didn\u2019t have it. Our child coincidentally stayed with their dad the weekend after I asked for help. Child came back and said \u2018my dad is so lucky! He and his girlfriend both got new iPads this weekend!\u2019 This has been a long time ago- when the first generation came out and even the cheaper versions were $800-$1,000. I didn\u2019t say a thing, but I did start getting paperwork together that following Monday and I filed, within two weeks. We squared it up in court, he fought it, called me a gold digger, which is just hilarious, along with a lot of other terrible things. But it took that moment, of me on my flip phone when everyone else had an iPhone, in my old beater of a car, scrambling to find money for that payment, in between my breaks at my 2 jobs, and realizing that things didn\u2019t have to be that hard. My child was suffering because their father wasn\u2019t being held responsible. Our child is grown now but I still regret not doing it sooner-maybe we could have had more vacations, less worries, and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have had to work two jobs and miss out on recitals, band concerts, sporting events, etc\u2026\nstill makes me sad :(", "NTA it's a request. It doesn't have to be honored. Put the money in a college/trades fund for your kids if you don't actually end up using it. If he starts struggling, *that's* when the question can be revisited for a few months.", "5 bedroom house?  I bet he buys eggs by the pallet", "NTA. Child support is to support the children. Not to furnish your Ex's lifestyle.   \nIt is not your fault your ex decided to buy a house with on one income with a person that's already had two and now having yet another one.   \nDude made his bed.", "YTA", "NTA. In fact you would be TA if you DID let him reduce support. This money is for your kids and it's what the courts decided they are legally entitled to. How he's living his life is his decision and shouldn't affect what the kids get for their support.", "NTA. They are his children. The government says he has to pay then he has to pay. He helped make the kids he must now support them", "NTA\n\nHe made them. He owes them support. How he deals with the children he had after is not your concern. He sounds like he does just fine. Your kids shouldn't have to suffer because he's living large.", "This. My mom complains constantly about letting my dad have a reduction and I just wish for everyone\u2019s sake she just took him for what the court said.", "It's in the thousands, possibly tens of thousands depending on how they traveled and where they stayed and if they budgeted carefully, which given everything else seems unlikely. And also just the fact that 5-7 people is going to be expensive as hell.", "Unless they're eating seven eggs a day like that other teen was...", ">having a house big enough to fit them all etc. She sounds mad that she can't be a stay at home parent and that they aren't all squished into a 3 bedroom home. \n\nHouse size doesn't matter if you're kids don't even want to live with you. Hes obviously doing something wrong. \n\nAnd how are they squished together when both kids have their own rooms? A three bedroom house isn't small.", "That kid clearly took Gaston's regimen a little bit too much to heart", "No, she\u2019s living off of support from her ex. Her means are significantly less.", "Since her children ARE his children\u2026 moot point. He has 3 more to care for, 2 are step kids and another that\u2019s his\u2026 but yeah. They\u2019re his kids too.", "You are absolutely NTA. Read that, say it out loud and believe it. I understand it helps to have that sentiment come from someone else, but you don\u2019t need it to be so. \n\nKeep being a good parent and looking out for your kids\u2019 best interests. :)", ">No, she\u2019s living off of support from her ex.\n\nYou miss where she said she has a fulltime job?", "NTA you\u2019d be supplementing their lifestyle. They are not in a position to have built that big of a house on a single income and gone on vacation. I am a big supporter of being a stay at home mom if you choose too but NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER CHILDREN. Your ex should be supporting all his kids first. If he can\u2019t then she needs to work to support her kids. Like you do. If you agree all you\u2019re doing is giving up money so he can put it back into their lifestyle. So they can live off that one income.", "Nta at all", "Honestly it\u2019s completely up to you, if you already have poor relationship with each other this won\u2019t matter much in the long run. But if you want to maintain a good relationship with him or at the very least a neutral one then it might not hurt to maybe find a middle-ground. Granted it\u2019s all up to you and no one knows the full details here other than you.", "NTA. Do not reduce support. Just because he is financially irresponsible having more kids, buying a new house, taking trips, etc doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have to provide fully for his first two children. Nope.", "NTA looks like he is prioritising the new family over his sons", "Why short your kids because he\u2019s a big spender?", "I'm gonna be THAT person: If you aren't willing to bear the financial responsibility of having children, you shouldn't have them.  If the courts think he has the means, then he needs to manage that. Allowing him to reduce his payments will only give him power over the situation and place a financial burden on you and your current husband.", "NTA Child support is for the child. His situation is his problem not yours.", "They are at an age where they are not going to want to leave friends, jobs, sports for the summer.", "Man, if you mistreat your kid because of a website, you need to start seeking help", "He can also provide for his 2 kids with OP as well", "Why do people insist that child support is expensive. Raising a kid is expensive, child support covers a portion of that. Heck I remember my ex throwing a fit in mediation over his meager $400/mth and I just slid a daycare receipt across the table...it was $900/mth for AFTER SCHOOL care (so 2.25 hours a day from 3-5:15pm). The judge laughed when my ex realized his child support didn't even cover half of 1 single expense, let alone all the medical expenses/travel we had, food, clothes, housing, extracurriculars, etc. His face was absolutely priceless.", "NAH.\n\nIt's fine to ask, but really what the court decides should be the arrangement unless both parties agree on something else.", "NTA, it's not your problem he lives beyond his means.", "NTA. Your current financial situation does not change his financial obligation. Get what you're entitled to. If that causes his new family a problem that's sad, but it doesn't remove his obligation to provide for the kids he already had.", "NTA. According to what you wrote, he doesn't have a financial hardship. He is overextended. There is a difference. He may not be able to keep the same lifestyle he has now, but that's not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your ex and his wife sound like those people who are incredibly materialistic despite not having enough money for that sort of lifestyle. They also sound very irresponsible towards their finances.", "Eh, if you guys are on good terms and you think the amount he is offering is still fair, take less. If it would make life harder on you than you could deal with go by what the court ordered and tell him its not your job to cover his expenditures. Either way be glad he is actively still there and paying. My dad never paid a cent to my mother. So at least hes still making some effort to be there for the kids, if hes doing it while trying to stabilize the household with his new mooch", "I don't think OP is WBTA at all, courts decide how much these things are. I am sure that the ex can appeal to the court for lowered payments.\n\nI do think OP is TA because they are trying to compare her ex's new family to hers, and are having a whinge because they haven't been on a holiday for 3 years.\n\nIt sounds like OP is upset she didn't get to go to Disney and Universal and doesn't have her own car, and now wants to take revenge on her ex by squeezing him for all he's worth.\n\nNote, her kids did go on that holiday, in case you missed it.", "If the courts will determine the amount of child support, please make sure to include documentation for *every expense* you make for your children, mainly their private school and why they need to attend that school (doctor's reports etc.). After reading your responses I can almost guarantee a judge will make sure your ex pays more than what you've accepted. \"I just bought a big expensive house\" isn't a valid reason to reduce child support and any judge will agree. It isn't \"financial hardship\" and the fact that your ex thinks it is is ridiculous. \n\n> I really don't want either of us to end up in a crappy financial situation\n\nThe only way a judge can make sure your agreement is fair is if you present them with every detail about the care your children requires and both parent's financial situations. The fact that you don't expect help paying for the private school shows that you are too lenient with your ex and your arrangement is skewed in his favour and you don't see it.\n\nLastly, if you can't afford legal counsel, please seek help from online sources such as r/legaladvice, folks there will be able to provide better advice based on your jurisdiction.", "The kids went on the vacation. OP is the one that missed out.", "Yes, it is since you totally ignore childcare. Mommy has less free time and kids want to be entertained. Mom has to organise more childcare if she wants to go out/ do something she can\u2019t bring kids.", "His wife not working, them together having so many kids, etc. is not OP's problem either.
