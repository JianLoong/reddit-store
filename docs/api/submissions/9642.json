Your ex sounds incredibly financially irresponsible, selfish, and immature, if his solution to not being able to pay his mortgage is to cut back on child support payments, not Disney vacations.", "NTA. He made the choice to build a home. Your kid should not suffer for his selfish and stupid financial choices.", "NTA\n\nWhy doesn't his wife work?

Not to the point of disability, but he wasn't really able to work for a couple of years. His ex wasn't willing to let the court renegotiate based on his unemployment. She had a lawyer, we didn't. He was able to sign up for a program the state has for unemployed fathers who owed child support, and eventually they were able to negotiate a better arrangement until he got back on his feet, but we were back to Goodwill and Mac & cheese trying not to fall too much further behind.\n\nYour ex is doing just fine, and there's no reason for you to consider his \"first world hardship\".", "NTA.\n\nYour ex's responsibilities to his children is not reduced because he chose to buy a house he can't afford.  \n\nYou did not place your ex in a bad situation; he placed himself in a bad situation by not putting his financial obligation to his children above his desire for expensive property.
