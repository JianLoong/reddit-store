With the backstory tho?? NTA *and* you should reevaluate this relationship cos it seems like your husbands problem isnt romance its romance with you.", "Funnily enough, I knew when my husband was going to propose to me. Unfortunately it was during lockdown.He wanted to propose on a specific date, but the ring hadn\u2019t been finished. I wanted to elope so we got a marriage license and we were married 72 hours later. The ring got delivered to the jewelers a week later, and he wanted to do the proposal he originally planned. Even though it was completely unnecessary and sweet, it made me feel special. We held a reception for friends and family this past June and it was awesome. \n\nOP, your feelings are completely valid. You already had to delay your reception. Your husband promised a romantic proposal to make up for the one you received. Now you get to watch have him essentially deliver his promise to someone else. It\u2019s cruel to expect you to plan a grand romantic gesture for someone else, when he couldn\u2019t provide you with the same. I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself, but his response is really telling. Do not continue to accept the bare minimum.

But now he wants to do something important for his friend, and she should help, not be a spoiled sport.", "Okay?  The OP clarified his clearly not very romantic and didn't want anything special for himself. So what? Wanting something for himself and for others are two very difference things and the OP's husband sounds like a very good guy for wanting to plan something big for his friend. The primary motivator for the OP to not help him now is bitterness and jealous. That is why I judged her as AH. Simple.", "If he didn't want to do it for himself but his friend, then that's fine. Nothing wrong with that. OP doesn't have to be jealous/bitter over it and stop him from doing it for someone else.", "She's not being oversensitive.

She would be oversensitive if she had asked him to not do it. She's not stopping him", "Ok, so he didn\u2019t want the big romantic proposal for himself. But he should have wanted it for her. She shouldn\u2019t have to play second fiddle to his friends", "His asking for her help and she's refusing on the basis that he didn't do it with her.

She compromised on her engagement. She\u2019s compromising for his friends engagement. What next? Her wedding? Children?

One person cannot be the only one doing the compromising. If you love someone, if you want the relationship to work out, then you must also be willing to compromise- particularly when it comes to the big occasions - the engagements, the weddings, the children, the parties - the whole lot. If one person has it their way every single time, that is a breeding ground for resentment. And there is nothing more damaging to a relationship than resentment.\n\nSometimes, for a happy marriage, it is necessary to put aside your own feelings for the sake of your significant other. If you cannot do that then you have no business asking them to compromise for you.", "I didn't really ask for your opinion in the first place.

We got engaged quietly, got married quietly, and have no regrets about that.

Everyone who's saying \"he's willing to be be romantic just not with you\" - nope. There's zero indication of that whatsoever.

Or furthermore, does helping them plan it mean suddenly you can have the same wedding?\n\nQED - just because he's capable of helping his friend plan what HE wants, doesn't mean he's capable of being in his shoes and wanting the same thing.

He has lots of great qualities, but he couldn\u2019t help other people be romantic if he tried since he just doesn\u2019t seem wired that way. However, he knows that he\u2019s not a creative, romantic type but he LISTENS TO ME.

But sadly, your husband is capable of planning grandiose elaborate gestures, just not for you. I'm sorry OP.", "Meh\nI didn\u2019t plan anything big but wanted to. The anxiety I was getting was insane though. I was pretty confident I would get a yes but it terrified me. Ended up getting my infant son at the time to hold the ring and just called her in and proposed. I was shaking and so nervous and so relieved when it was done. I\u2019m not a normally nervous person either. I\u2019ve also helped friends plan their elaborate proposals\u2026. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it.", "It's all relative... my proposal wasn't romantic at all, but we do lots of other romantic stuff. So the moment is a funny story to tell, but not thos giant gesture. I dont feel like I'm missing out because we dance and eat by candlight and he buys me flowers and the wine I like lol\nIt's not the proposal that matter. But the life together", "NTA! Yeah you shouldn\u2019t have married him! That man does not care enough to properly propose to you and it\u2019s not lack of being a romantic since he can clearly do it for other people! He settled for you! If he truly thought you were his one true love he would have went over the top for you!", "Me too, me too. My ex fianc\u00e9 told me all about how romantic he was with precious partners- randomly spreading out rose petals on the bed before a partner would come home, buying flowers etc etc. Never once, in the nine effing years we were together, did he EVER do anything even remotely sweet/romantic for me. Yet he talked all the time about how much of a romantic at heart he was- especially to previous partners/flings. \n\nI have a new partner who treats me as I ought to be treated and I've never been happier.", "I figured laziness! It's definitely not great, it's just a different brand of not great!", "I dunno, it may not be a shiny trinket, but I think the mini-fridge is pretty romantic. It says \"I pay attention to the tiny details about you and look for ways to make things better (smoother/easier/whatever)\". It beats the guy who has no idea what you drink, let alone your preferred temperature.", "Mini fridge isn't roses, but man, that's sweet. And roses die, while you still have cold Diet Coke!", "I think the minifridge story is amazingly romantic. \n\nOP, NTA.", "So he chose a place he couldn\u2019t kneel as his spot to propose? Oof", "I had this same thought!", "Honestly, I love the mini fridge. The thing that made the whole event so funny but also slightly disappointing in the moment was how much he had hyped this gift up for weeks leading up to my birthday. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting as the surprise, but when we pulled up at the mall and went into Sears I realized this probably wasn\u2019t the grand romantic gesture that had been hyped.\n\nBut, I\u2019ve had cold beer and Diet Coke ever since and I know my husband\u2019s love language is very practical gifts/acts of service.", "Now I'm picturing you taking a beat or two to tilt your head, raise an eyebrow and do a cartoon blink, possibly with a stifled hysterical giggle.", "\"I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints; the sinners have much more fun\" - Billy Joel, \"Only the Good Die Young\"."]}
