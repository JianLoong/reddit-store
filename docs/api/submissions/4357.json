Unfortunately it was during lockdown.He wanted to propose on a specific date, but the ring hadn\u2019t been finished. I wanted to elope so we got a marriage license and we were married 72 hours later. The ring got delivered to the jewelers a week later, and he wanted to do the proposal he originally planned. Even though it was completely unnecessary and sweet, it made me feel special. We held a reception for friends and family this past June and it was awesome. \n\nOP, your feelings are completely valid. You already had to delay your reception. Your husband promised a romantic proposal to make up for the one you received. Now you get to watch have him essentially deliver his promise to someone else. It\u2019s cruel to expect you to plan a grand romantic gesture for someone else, when he couldn\u2019t provide you with the same. I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself, but his response is really telling. Do not continue to accept the bare minimum.

But now he wants to do something important for his friend, and she should help, not be a spoiled sport.", "Okay?  The OP clarified his clearly not very romantic and didn't want anything special for himself. So what? Wanting something for himself and for others are two very difference things and the OP's husband sounds like a very good guy for wanting to plan something big for his friend. The primary motivator for the OP to not help him now is bitterness and jealous. That is why I judged her as AH. Simple.", "If he didn't want to do it for himself but his friend, then that's fine. Nothing wrong with that. OP doesn't have to be jealous/bitter over it and stop him from doing it for someone else.", "She's not being oversensitive.

She shouldn\u2019t have to play second fiddle to his friends", "His asking for her help and she's refusing on the basis that he didn't do it with her.

She compromised on her engagement. She\u2019s compromising for his friends engagement. What next? Her wedding? Children?

One person cannot be the only one doing the compromising. If you love someone, if you want the relationship to work out, then you must also be willing to compromise- particularly when it comes to the big occasions - the engagements, the weddings, the children, the parties - the whole lot. If one person has it their way every single time, that is a breeding ground for resentment. And there is nothing more damaging to a relationship than resentment.\n\nSometimes, for a happy marriage, it is necessary to put aside your own feelings for the sake of your significant other. If you cannot do that then you have no business asking them to compromise for you.", "I didn't really ask for your opinion in the first place.

We got engaged quietly, got married quietly, and have no regrets about that.

Or furthermore, does helping them plan it mean suddenly you can have the same wedding?\n\nQED - just because he's capable of helping his friend plan what HE wants, doesn't mean he's capable of being in his shoes and wanting the same thing.

He has lots of great qualities, but he couldn\u2019t help other people be romantic if he tried since he just doesn\u2019t seem wired that way. However, he knows that he\u2019s not a creative, romantic type but he LISTENS TO ME.

Maybe she has very specific taste, maybe he already knows a \"big over-top\" proposal is not going to be received well by his wife. Who knows.\n\nWhy is everyone jumping to conclusions. The top voted comment right now is \"He is perfectly capable and happy to be romantic just not with you\" -- Lord, you folks read two paragraphs and that's your judgement, wtf...\n\nOnly thing I agree for sure he did wrong is call OP an asshole.\n\nAnd another thing. Why is OP upset about this proposal business. If she really wants a make up proposal why not just tell him what she wants. Maybe tell him to save up for a nice vacation for them, or a fancy dinner or something. I thought we are all passed this men should initiate everything business.", "Honestly, that's almost worse cause he's still making OP feel like crap now. It would be extremely short sighted of him to actually involve OP in the planning", "Lol, What does it say about this sub when a simple question like this gets downvoted to the abyss?", "This thread upsets me so much, I'm replying to commiserate with you...", "And if everybody has made it clear from birth to now that you're fundamentally unlovable, you'll be a target for exactly this kind of bar-is-in-the-basement guy, and you'll feel grateful and lucky to have him.", "Wow a comment that actually makes sense instead of all the crazy embellishment in this thread. Maybe it has something to do with you having 18 years of experience on this topic...", "Right that's true.", "The issue is not how deep he is.  The issue is that his wife wasn't worth effort he is putting toward someone else.\n\nAs to her having specific tastes ... dude ... he did *nothing* for her.  He didn't ask what she wanted, either, which is the easiest way for \"simple\" guys to succeed.  I have seen men put more work into researching a television than researching what their possible future spouses want.\n\nThe problem is that he fears letting his male friend down more than he feared disappointing his own (at the time) girlfriend, who now is his spouse.\n\nThere is simply no way to polish that turd of a scenario.", "Chucklefuck \ud83e\udd23", "Indeed, they can't measure in love", "> The issue is that his wife wasn't worth effort he is putting toward someone else.\n\nThis is not how it works. Just because someone put effort into something does NOT make it important. I've spent countless hours pulling weeds from my lawn, it does not mean in anyway it's more important then spending time with my wife. I did it because it annoyed me and more importantly it was very easy and requires little thinking...\n\n> he fears letting his male friend down more than he feared disappointing his own (at the time) girlfriend\n\nThis is nuts. Why are you suggesting he is doing this to please his buddy. What evidence do you have? A friend asking me to do something so benign like help with his engagement is NOT fear inducing... I'll do it for the same reason I pull weeds out of my yard, it's easy and requires little thinking.", "Have you considered that this is rather low stakes helping the friend. Doesn\u2019t really matter to the husband if it doesn\u2019t go well. But it does matter if he messes up his proposal", "Fucklechuck", "Exactly!!!! \ud83d\udcaf. If a friend ask me for help I will probably do something dumb to embarrass him because he's an idiot for trusting me to do it in the first place.\n\nBut never would I be so nonchalant with my wife.", "NTA. Your husband however definitely is and I\u2019m sorry to say this but doesn\u2019t seem to love you that much.", "NTA, but on the off chance - maybe he has fun planning things with you and it just isn\u2019t as much fun without you?\n\nI know it\u2019s a long shot/ reeks of some magical-thinking, but I know more than one couple like this.", "NTA, but I know a lot of comments are drawing comparisons between how he treats you and how he treats his friend, and I just want to toss this thought out there:\n\nIf this guy is usually wonderful, supportive, understanding, etc, it may be worth asking yourself why he can do this, but couldn\u2019t do the nice proposal for you. My guess, not knowing him at all, is that he\u2019s self-conscious or for some reason shy about this particular type of activity; he can plan it when it\u2019s for his friend, because his friend is the one who actually has to a) decide what\u2019s a good idea and what isn\u2019t, and b) actually put himself out there. It\u2019s one thing to come up with a million ideas for his friend (knowing that only the best ideas will be put into practice), but entirely another to make the final decisions and actually put himself out there.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be angry with you for expressing your feelings. Maybe he\u2019s ashamed and doesn\u2019t want to admit to himself that he should have \u2014 and could have \u2014 done better; maybe he was hoping to use this proposal to get ideas about what you like so he doesn\u2019t need to figure that out himself; or maybe he\u2019s just an asshole who cares more about his friend than about you. You know him best, so maybe you can figure out which it is. But tread carefully if you find yourself concluding that he cares about his friend / friend\u2019s SO more than he cares about you; if you think that\u2019s the case, then that\u2019s important information and you should do something about it before separation/divorce gets any more complicated than it already will be. But if that just doesn\u2019t feel right with your understanding of who he is, then it\u2019s worth figuring out what\u2019s really going on here, even if only for your peace of mind.", "Please understand that you are NTA. No matter what he says or will say in the future. No matter who disagrees, you are not in the wrong. He didn\u2019t even bother properly proposing to you but for another woman it\u2019s fine?? The bar you have for yourself is literally on the floor. Please leave this man. You deserve an over the top proposal with an over the top wedding if that\u2019s what you want. You want and crave romance right? He can\u2019t even do that for you and y\u2019all are supposed to be in the honeymoon phase or whatever. The point is, when you propose to someone, you gotta be real committed and real in love. Doesn\u2019t seem that\u2019s what you\u2019re receiving from him. I hope we get an update one day saying you left him but at the very least, respect yourself enough to ask for more. More love. More romance. More respect. More more more. You cannot be content with the bare minimum because it literally only gets lower from here. Good luck OP! You deserve the world", "NTA where was all this help and attention to detail when it was your turn.", "NTA. However, he\u2019s showing you how much he doesn\u2019t value you\u2026", "NTA how incredibly insensitive on husband. If no proposal was good enough for you, why on earth should you extend your free time on this for his friend's gf?\n\nIts too much.\n\nBe cautious of someone who treats their aquantainces like gold and their loved ones like dirt OP -its an avoidant attachment trait", "NTA", "> He is perfectly capable and happy to be romantic just not with you\n\nWow this take is so farfetched I don't know where to begin.\n\nYou folks think the only reason he is helping his friends is because he is activating some sort of romance reserve hidden inside him?\n\nI'm just one guy, but I can definitely tell you I've done big  things for friends that has nothing to do with romance, but rather because it was easy or because I thought it would be a good laugh.\n\nSeriously, take a step back for a moment and think of this as a low effort, low stake action because for a lot of men that's most likely how they see it.\n\nFor people of all genders, being asked to help do something is a world's different than being a self-starter. Especially when you are being asked to do something you don't really care about, or have no stake in - you just do it, because wtf not.\n\nI had this conversation with my male friends many times before. If one of us call the other up and say, \"can you come over and help me with something?\", the first thought is \"when\", not \"what\" or \"why\". Most of us generally agree to this principle and we live by it.\n\nNow him calling her an asshole for not wanting to help, that a different story.", "This story makes me sad as the one where the husband was annoyed that Op was excitedly planning her family members wedding when she wasn't excited for her own because she never got her own wedding and was railroaded because of a dying grandma.", "Right? Also while she's allowed to not want to help, if she went as far as to outline these entitlement-rooted reasons for not wanting to help, then I'd say he's even right for calling her an asshole. It really depends on what she said. If it was just a slightly sad \"I just wish you could have done the same thing for me\" then fine - but if it's aggressive like \"so you can be romantic with him but not me?\" (which is also illogical) then yes she's an asshole and he was probably calling her one for that, not sitting this out.", "She did tell him\u2026and he brushed it off and then called her an asshole because she won\u2019t brush aside her own feelings\u2026..", "Lol and not one of them responded either.", "I see that you\u2019re a tired OLD man and that\u2019s probably why I make sense to you! Haha. I\u2019m utterly convinced Reddit is populated by young people who haven\u2019t properly lived yet. They\u2019re also very black and white which is rarely applicable in the real world. The nuances of life and relationship is something that you acquire by experience through living life and meeting loads of different types of people.", "Yes! my husband always has big romantic ideas, but the pressure always affects the execution. It's about the marriage, not the proposal, not the wedding... I loved how clumsy and not romantic my proposal was (on a parking lot under a flickering light.)", "Red pill, eh?\nYou kind of sound so argumentative that even the person above, who supported your argument, is apparently really out of the area you feel OK with... You're arguing with your own supporters lol", "If that\u2019s how he feels and he\u2019s having anxieties about it, he should be an adult and tell OP that. You need to communicate for a relationship to work.", "To me, that is best! It is all about the marriage. The proposal, wedding, honeymoon are all insignificant because they\u2019re fleeting. A moment in a (hopefully) long marriage. My mom and MIL planned every detail of my wedding and they were so happy that they got to do it! I got my marriage and that\u2019s what I wanted so I\u2019m pretty happy too. I hope you have a happy marriage and may everyday be more beautiful than the last.", "Lol! Eh all good. If he gets it, he gets it. If not then it\u2019s all good. Also I\u2019ve been on Reddit too much today my brain is fried! I need a new hobby \ud83d\ude02"]}
