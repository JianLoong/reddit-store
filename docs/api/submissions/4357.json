Why is he so willing to go above and beyond for a friend but not able to do the bare minimum for the person he loves? Does he have trouble expressing emotions maybe?", "NTA.

With the backstory tho?? NTA *and* you should reevaluate this relationship cos it seems like your husbands problem isnt romance its romance with you.", "Funnily enough, I knew when my husband was going to propose to me. Unfortunately it was during lockdown.He wanted to propose on a specific date, but the ring hadn\u2019t been finished. I wanted to elope so we got a marriage license and we were married 72 hours later. The ring got delivered to the jewelers a week later, and he wanted to do the proposal he originally planned. Even though it was completely unnecessary and sweet, it made me feel special. We held a reception for friends and family this past June and it was awesome. \n\nOP, your feelings are completely valid. You already had to delay your reception. Your husband promised a romantic proposal to make up for the one you received. Now you get to watch have him essentially deliver his promise to someone else. It\u2019s cruel to expect you to plan a grand romantic gesture for someone else, when he couldn\u2019t provide you with the same. I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself, but his response is really telling. Do not continue to accept the bare minimum. If he is incapable of providing more, it\u2019ll be your decision as to whether or not a lifetime of non romantic gestures will be enough for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA - it\u2019s his friend", "Can you share some of the grand romantic gestures you've done for him?", "YTA. Stop being bitter and jealous over petty things. If he wants to do something good for his friend, something he himself may not have had the chance to do, then you shouldn't be stopping him from doing it, but instead encouraging and helping him. You don't need to ruin somebody else's day for no reason.", "This comment hit me right in the feels\u2026\n\nOP: NTA.", "Agree with this completely. He is going over the top for someone else's proposal and is calling OP an asshole for not helping him create a special moment for someone else. NTA.", "This is the epitome of if he wanted to he would. You \nare being far too generous with the basement bar, I would say that the bar is set in hell. I feel so bad for her, and I hope the husband changes his tune.", "Yeah that\u2019s the comment that got me!", "I agree with this. \nMakes me wonder why the husband would propose marriage for OP. Either way OP deserves someone who will invest their time and effort.", "No, he's willing to go all out to help his boy, his buddy, his pal. Ya know, another guy who's opinion might actually matter to those around him. Not OP's - she's just someone he married.", "The hey btw do you want to get married, justice of the peace guy? Gonna go with a zero here.", "She's not stopping him. She has the right to feel upset seeing her husband putting so much effort to do something for a friend when didn't put that effort for both of them.", "He could have done it at any point, like he said he would. It just doesn't seem important to him.", "How did he not have the chance to do something for OP? He just never bothered to get off his ass and do something.", "\u201cSomething he himself may not have had the chance to do\u201d\n\nIf he wanted to, he would. End of.", "Right? ... NTA clearly.", "Not really. Circumstances may've been different. She needs to stop being oversensitive.", "If it isn't important to him then, fine. She should respect that. But now he wants to do something important for his friend, and she should help, not be a spoiled sport.", "Okay?  The OP clarified his clearly not very romantic and didn't want anything special for himself. So what? Wanting something for himself and for others are two very difference things and the OP's husband sounds like a very good guy for wanting to plan something big for his friend. The primary motivator for the OP to not help him now is bitterness and jealous. That is why I judged her as AH. Simple.", "If he didn't want to do it for himself but his friend, then that's fine. Nothing wrong with that. OP doesn't have to be jealous/bitter over it and stop him from doing it for someone else.", "She's not being oversensitive. Her husband wants to do something big (which means that he cares about these things so it's not 'petty') and she doesn't want to be a part of it. She would be oversensitive if she had asked him to not do it. She's not stopping him", "Ok, so he didn\u2019t want the big romantic proposal for himself. But he should have wanted it for her. She shouldn\u2019t have to play second fiddle to his friends", "His asking for her help and she's refusing on the basis that he didn't do it with her. So on that basis, yes she is being oversensitive and petty. If she said I can't do it because I got XXXX to do or whatever then fine, but the sole reason she doesn't want to do it, is because he didn't do it with her.", "He himself would be a significant part of that. If he didn't want to do that, then she should respect that. But he now wants it for his friend, she should also respect that and not be petty about it and help him.", "Why does she have to be the one that makes all the compromises for him? She compromised on her engagement. She\u2019s compromising for his friends engagement. What next? Her wedding? Children? Work? \n\nYes, marriage is about respect, and about compromise, but it cannot be one sided. And so far it is very one sided in his favour.", "If she wants to stay in a healthy relationship then she should be compromising. Simple as that.", "I\u2019m assuming at this point that you\u2019re a troll so I won\u2019t be responding any further, but just in case you\u2019re not, or just in case some idiotic, easily influenced, well meaning but misdirected kid reads this far, I would like to reiterate :\n\nMarriage is about compromise. One person cannot be the only one doing the compromising. If you love someone, if you want the relationship to work out, then you must also be willing to compromise- particularly when it comes to the big occasions - the engagements, the weddings, the children, the parties - the whole lot. If one person has it their way every single time, that is a breeding ground for resentment. And there is nothing more damaging to a relationship than resentment.\n\nSometimes, for a happy marriage, it is necessary to put aside your own feelings for the sake of your significant other. If you cannot do that then you have no business asking them to compromise for you.", "I didn't really ask for your opinion in the first place. Either way I would call someone throwing insults and name-calling a \"troll\".", "NTA but yell your husband that you will not help him assist his friend with a over-the-top top proposal.  Since he was so inconsiderate with yours  \nPlease divorce him.\n\nMy proposal was simple and sweet.He proposed to me on the Ferris Wheel at Balboa Fun Zone where we had our 1st date.  Our friends and family came out of the woodwork after we got off to congrate us.", "Did OP see the movie Walk the Line?  When Johnny Cash (Joaquin) proposed to June Carter (Reece) in the back of the bus during a road trip she turned him down and said \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re proposing to me like this!\u201d I\u2019m thinking you should have spoken up earlier.   Now that he knows how hurt your feelings are he better step up and surprise you soon with a better proposal.", "NTA", "NTA. \nIs he shy at all? I can totally see my husband being all full of ideas for someone ELSE to do, that he would not feel comfortable doing himself. I\u2019m okay with that though, because I\u2019m the same way. We got engaged quietly, got married quietly, and have no regrets about that. My husband would not be planning anything for his friend though or even showing up to watch, just texting him wild ideas and egging him on. So maybe your husband isn\u2019t shy, and is just an asshole.", "NTA. You\u2019re husband is a clod. He cares more about these other people than you. Get out before you have kids.", "NTA\n\nYeah he is either fucking his friend or the friends future fianc\u00e9. \n\nNope nope nope. Your man should never be more romantic with other people than they are with you.", "NTA. Note how he\u2019s perfectly capable of being \u201cromantic\u201d he just can\u2019t be bothered to be so with you. \n\nA good lesson to learn early is that we teach people how to treat us by the behavior we accept from them. You\u2019ve taught your husband that the bar for you  is hell. \n\nNote also how he\u2019s going out of his way to show you just how much effort he\u2019s making and then calling you an AH for being rightfully upset. He is rubbing your face in how little he values you.", "NTA if he gtfo he wants you to help plan something for someone else that he never did for you what kinda drugs is he on", "NTA", "This. And, OP, I would tell your husband this. What he's doing IS hurtful, and there's no saying he still can't use that romantic energy for something for you...", "Ouch. You talking to OP or me? Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see how much more you expect and hope for other people vs yourself.", "NTA. This person said it right", "This right here Op read that again.", "And some art supplies.", "I wondered if the husband was piggybacking on his friend's proposal to do something nice for OP \n\nHe's either an inconsiderate ass or trying to do something sweet and kind and getting stomped on. I hope we get an update", "Lol this. Romance goes both ways.", "Perhaps a small studio to go with it?"]}
