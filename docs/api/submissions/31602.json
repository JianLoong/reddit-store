{"id": 31602, "submission_id": "182e7c5", "title": "AITA for walking out of Thanksgiving dinner with my ex\u2019s family?", "selftext": "I have a fairly decent relationship with my ex\u2019s family. When his mom asked if I would join them for thanksgiving I said yes because I want my son to spend as much time with them. My ex husband and I can usually get along for the sake of our son and that took many years of work since it was very rocky for a while. \n\nWhen we broke up he starting dating a 22 year old girl who was at the time 11 years older than my son. He had her spend the night I was still living in our house. Long story short I left, we divorced and this girl was incredibly rude to me and my son on numerous occasions.  Needless to say I don\u2019t like her never did and never will.  They don\u2019t date anymore but they are friends which is fine as long as I don\u2019t have to deal with her.\n\nSo I show up with my son to his grandparents house and we are waiting on him to get there. He shows up with this girl to stay and have dinner since I guess she helped cook the turkey. I was so uncomfortable. His mother claims she didn\u2019t know she was coming. I go into the den and ask my son if he knew she was coming and he had no idea. So I asked him if he would be upset if I left because I wasn\u2019t given a heads up that she was coming or I could have made the decision for my son to stay with his grandparents and I would have made other arrangements for myself since my family doesn\u2019t live here. My ex\u2019s father says out loud let me help Robert out and brings the girl into the den. Acting as if this is completely normal because he had always like her and not me as much. I politely excused myself and told them I was going home. My ex\u2019s response was he didn\u2019t like think he had to ask me since they aren\u2019t even dating.\n\nI calmly said (I\u2019m proud of myself because I wanted to cuss both of them out) I would have liked a heads up so I could have made a decision to come or not. He had a ton of excuses saying she changed her mind at the last minute. I said a simple text or heads up would have been great instead of making me look like and asshole. I felt bad for my son because he was caught off guard too. \n\nI have spent so much time trying to heal from that whole time and situation and my ex just acted like I was being irrational (classic gaslighting) because I didn\u2019t want to sit and have a family meal with them.

You were blindsided by your ex, who was fully aware of how uncomfortable you would be.  You were uncomfortable and acted with maturity and respect.  All those who tell you your feelings don't matter would be singing a different tune if it were their Thanksgiving dinner and they were blindsided.\n\nCo-parenting is a delicate balance. Your exe is either an idiot or mean and petty.  As you said, all he had to do was send a text. And his \"She changed her mind\" bs is just that.  She helped bake the turkey but wasn't going to come until the last minute.  So last minute that your ex couldn't text three words, xxxx is coming.\n\nIf I were you, I'd consider ceasing combined holidays.

The real victim here though is your son.  Your FIL may like this woman, your son doesn't.

Your feelings are valid; I can't imagine how awkward it would've been to have to sit through that entire dinner.
