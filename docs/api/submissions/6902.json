I immediately took on a 16 year old girl, 18 year old boy, and 20 year old boy. I have loved them like my own since day 1. My own kids were then a 6 year old girl and 10 year old boy. When my stepdaughter turned 16, her mom who is married to an actual millionaire bought her a brand new car. The mom and my husband do not get along. They\u2019ve been divorced for 15 years and she is absolutely nuts. Tries to use the kids to hurt him in every possible way, even as adults. She refused to go to the 18 year olds college graduation if I went. So my husband didn\u2019t go, to be loyal to me. Stuff like that she is awful about. Fast forward now, the stepdaughter is 18 and in college. A year ago she pissed her mom off and her mom took her car from her. I went and got her a brand new 2021 car. In my name. I have made over $4,000 in payments in a year. Her mom\u2019s mom took away her phone because she was also tacky. I gave her my brand new iPhone XR, instead of giving it to my now 12 year old. I pay her phone bill. I took off to move her into college. When she wrecked the car, I paid the deductible and took care of everything. I offered to let her use my car while hers was being repaired because I have a work car. Well over this holiday break, she started texting her dad saying I make things awkward for her. She says this because I told her not to let our 15 month old drink from her straw because she was sick. She then told her dad to choose between me or her. That he can just go love me and my kids. I texted her and told her that was not right. That we have done a multitude more for mentally, emotionally, and physically than we have done for my kids. Now she\u2019s saying she doesn\u2019t want me in her life at all. All because I told her not to let me baby drink after her while sick. The baby is a whole other post. For a year I have kept my mouth shut about what I want done with our child because every time I tell her hey please don\u2019t feed him chocolate at 6 months old she freaks out and leaves. Then my husband and I have tension. AITA for telling her to bring her car and phone back since she doesn\u2019t want me in her life? Her dad cannot get the car in his name because he has had to take out so many loans for her for school because her mom refused to let her claim herself on taxes, so she doesn\u2019t qualify because of her step dads income.", "created_utc": 1673273754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107fg7s/aita_step_daughter_wants_me_out_of_her_life_so_i/", "score": 532, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds awful, and I\u2019m so sorry you do so much, only to get so little respect. Why is your husband then mad at you after she storms out?

After all, it sounds like she's accustomed to getting everything she wants . . .\n\nYes, take back the car. Take back the phone. If she won't give them back, you can have the car repossessed. If she won't give back the phone, you can simply stop service. You may not get the phone itself back, but she will need to get her own phone service and pay for it herself. Which also means she'll need to figure out how to do that.\n\nIt sounds to me that she's been coddled and, because of that, has no perspective on what's reasonable nor much in the way of basic life skills. At some point she's going to need to get some perspective and figure out how to take care of herself. This seems like a good time to start. \n\nAnd she needs to learn that if you f@\\*k around, you're gonna find out. Let her feel some consequences.

I'm not saying that's what you are doing but this post is giving those vibes. You bought an 18 year old a brand new car because she did something so shitty to her mom that her other car was taken away. You gave her a brand new phone, again because her mom took hers away. Is this some weird competition with the ex or are you trying to buy your step-daughter's affection? Personally, I'd back way off and try to maintain a cordial relationship with her as that what she seems to want.\n\nAlso you let your husband miss his kid's graduation out of \"loyalty\" to you?

If she refuses have the car towed, you can either turn off service on the phone or report it lost/stolen to the carrier which would make it unusable unless you yourself brought it back up there. The only way I\u2019d be willing to let her keep the car is if she or her dad/mom refinanced it in their name and reimbursed you for the down payment and total cost of payments up till now. At that point she\u2019ll probably do/say anything to make you give it back by either being volatile or kissing your ass (the latter isn\u2019t likely genuine just to shut you up so she can keep it so I wouldn\u2019t be likely to believe it if she plays that card). Maybe after learning to do things on her own she can grow to appreciate what you\u2019ve done for her but it\u2019ll take time. Don\u2019t be a doormat regardless of how convenient it may be for anyone else including your husband. He\u2019s likely to do the same just giving you a heads up, he\u2019s likely to take her side no matter how wrong she is.

It's your property to do with what you need.\n\nThe phone thing is a little more sketchy, but since it was yours, you can request it back too. I would definitely stop paying her phone bill.\n\nWhole thing seems a typical teenager dealing with jealousy and resentment due to her dad's divorce.

Hostility between divorced parents, mom using money as leverage with her daughter and to one-up her ex with your step-daughter caught in the middle.  It sounds, too, like the ex-wife has been successful in getting you both to try to compete with her financially in the car, phone, money gifts to your step-daughter.\n\nYou paint the ex-wife in a very negative light but I suspect that there is more to the story. The ex might have taken the car and phone away from her daughter for misbehavior -- e.g., for similar reasons that you are considering taking away the car and phone.\n\nIf you want to build a better relationship with your stepdaughter, I suggest you run to family counseling.

I'm assuming this is real.\n\nPackage up everything you have written in this post and anything else you can think of into a google document. Use objective language that does not assign blame or judgment onto your stepdaughter, her parents, or your husband. You may also handwrite it out. Have a private conversation with your husband and show him how the behavior looks when it's been written out (in list form or just in a letter that describes the actions, emotions, context, and consequences).\n\nExplain to your husband that this is an unacceptable situation to you. Use phrases like \"I don't like when\" and \"It bothers me when\" to reduce conflict. \"I feel/felt disrespected\" is a huge one that will carry you really far. Your husband WILL be sensitive on many of these subjects. He is probably worried that you are trying to damage his relationship with his kids, he's probably scared that the mom and her millionaire husband will seduce his kids away with promises of gifts and money, and you have a fucking BABY which is occupying just as much time and energy for him as it is for you. Seriously, don't undersell this point. Yes, you both have lots of experience taking care of babies by now, but it's still a lot of stress and a lot of expenses, alongside the stress and expenses for your other two children who have their own needs.\n\nHere's the critical part: **Ask him what you should do.** He cannot be jerked around by his wife on this one. You may think the problem is between you and your stepdaughter, but really it's between your stepdaughter and her father. I would recommend having a small, reasonable plan like \"I want [her] to return the car and apologize to me, and pay for her own phone bill,\" just in case he agrees that something needs to be done but doesn't really have any good idea what to do about it. The reality is, while you will only be explaining all the ways in which she disrespected YOU, both of us know that he's the one who's actually being disrespected and treated horribly. He is just desperate to maintain his relationship with his children, as any dad would, so he's ignoring his own feelings for the sake of the kid. But he won't ignore your feelings if he's worth anything as a man.\n\nGood luck.
