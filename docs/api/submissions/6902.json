I immediately took on a 16 year old girl, 18 year old boy, and 20 year old boy. I have loved them like my own since day 1. My own kids were then a 6 year old girl and 10 year old boy. When my stepdaughter turned 16, her mom who is married to an actual millionaire bought her a brand new car. The mom and my husband do not get along. They\u2019ve been divorced for 15 years and she is absolutely nuts. Tries to use the kids to hurt him in every possible way, even as adults. She refused to go to the 18 year olds college graduation if I went. So my husband didn\u2019t go, to be loyal to me. Stuff like that she is awful about. Fast forward now, the stepdaughter is 18 and in college. A year ago she pissed her mom off and her mom took her car from her. I went and got her a brand new 2021 car. In my name. I have made over $4,000 in payments in a year. Her mom\u2019s mom took away her phone because she was also tacky. I gave her my brand new iPhone XR, instead of giving it to my now 12 year old. I pay her phone bill. I took off to move her into college. When she wrecked the car, I paid the deductible and took care of everything. I offered to let her use my car while hers was being repaired because I have a work car. Well over this holiday break, she started texting her dad saying I make things awkward for her. She says this because I told her not to let our 15 month old drink from her straw because she was sick. She then told her dad to choose between me or her. That he can just go love me and my kids. I texted her and told her that was not right. That we have done a multitude more for mentally, emotionally, and physically than we have done for my kids. Now she\u2019s saying she doesn\u2019t want me in her life at all. All because I told her not to let me baby drink after her while sick. The baby is a whole other post. For a year I have kept my mouth shut about what I want done with our child because every time I tell her hey please don\u2019t feed him chocolate at 6 months old she freaks out and leaves. Then my husband and I have tension. AITA for telling her to bring her car and phone back since she doesn\u2019t want me in her life? Her dad cannot get the car in his name because he has had to take out so many loans for her for school because her mom refused to let her claim herself on taxes, so she doesn\u2019t qualify because of her step dads income.", "created_utc": 1673273754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107fg7s/aita_step_daughter_wants_me_out_of_her_life_so_i/", "score": 284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds awful, and I\u2019m so sorry you do so much, only to get so little respect. Why is your husband then mad at you after she storms out?

If she won't give back the phone, you can simply stop service. You may not get the phone itself back, but she will need to get her own phone service and pay for it herself. Which also means she'll need to figure out how to do that.\n\nIt sounds to me that she's been coddled and, because of that, has no perspective on what's reasonable nor much in the way of basic life skills. At some point she's going to need to get some perspective and figure out how to take care of herself.

I'm not saying that's what you are doing but this post is giving those vibes. You bought an 18 year old a brand new car because she did something so shitty to her mom that her other car was taken away. You gave her a brand new phone, again because her mom took hers away. Is this some weird competition with the ex or are you trying to buy your step-daughter's affection? Personally, I'd back way off and try to maintain a cordial relationship with her as that what she seems to want.\n\nAlso you let your husband miss his kid's graduation out of \"loyalty\" to you?

If she refuses have the car towed, you can either turn off service on the phone or report it lost/stolen to the carrier which would make it unusable unless you yourself brought it back up there. The only way I\u2019d be willing to let her keep the car is if she or her dad/mom refinanced it in their name and reimbursed you for the down payment and total cost of payments up till now. At that point she\u2019ll probably do/say anything to make you give it back by either being volatile or kissing your ass (the latter isn\u2019t likely genuine just to shut you up so she can keep it so I wouldn\u2019t be likely to believe it if she plays that card). Maybe after learning to do things on her own she can grow to appreciate what you\u2019ve done for her but it\u2019ll take time. Don\u2019t be a doormat regardless of how convenient it may be for anyone else including your husband. He\u2019s likely to do the same just giving you a heads up, he\u2019s likely to take her side no matter how wrong she is.

It's your property to do with what you need.\n\nThe phone thing is a little more sketchy, but since it was yours, you can request it back too.

Hostility between divorced parents, mom using money as leverage with her daughter and to one-up her ex with your step-daughter caught in the middle.  It sounds, too, like the ex-wife has been successful in getting you both to try to compete with her financially in the car, phone, money gifts to your step-daughter.\n\nYou paint the ex-wife in a very negative light but I suspect that there is more to the story. The ex might have taken the car and phone away from her daughter for misbehavior -- e.g., for similar reasons that you are considering taking away the car and phone.\n\nIf you want to build a better relationship with your stepdaughter, I suggest you run to family counseling.

Draw that line. Sad, they're teenagers, but the 4k you spent in a car could have gone to a college fund to one of your OWN kid. \n\nThe ex is married to a millionaire. Has she ever given any gift to one of your children? No. So why would you give her a kid an iPhone and let your own kid go without?\n\nYou're not a millionaire. One day your husband divorces you and it will be good to have a good mattress to lie on.", "NTA because of how much responsibility you've taken on for her, but I think you also need to think more about how she's feeling. There's no way that this issue with the baby was the only thing that caused her to say she wants you out of her life. Perhaps she identifies with her mother a lot, or you restrict her interactions with your youngest child to a degree that makes her feel unwelcome. I don't know, obviously, but it seems like there's a lot more going on here than meets the eye.", "Yup, do not reward bad behavior. Also allow her to earned it back", "NTA except for probably spoiling her too much, (why not a used car? Sounds like you can't afford it with all the school loans) and it sounds like she's being a bit favored over your other kids. Your husband is being an asshole by not handling this properly.", "You are very clearly leaving out a lot of info. But frankly you, your husband, and his ex-wife all sound crappy and childish.", "Nta", "NTA. And your stepdaughter sounds narcissistic. There\u2019s something really wrong with her.", "NTA take away the car it's your property along with the phone. If she wants something then she can ask mommy dearest. \n\nAnd she is going to learn her actions have consequences. And your husband needs to stop taking loans out for her college expenses.", "NTA. Get the car back and be done with the [games. At](https://games.At) this point if wrecked it could cost you everything. As for the phone lesson learned. Turn it off and let her keep it. Time for the girl to learn life is not a free ride.", "She chose all this when she decided to get married to this man with multiple children that are near adult age.", "OP contributed to the behaviour by provided a new car and a new phot.\nAt this age the daughter can make her own payment", "> i think that the step-daughter isn't just ticked off bc of the baby thing\n\nYeah, whatever's going on isn't because of a straw.", "> why couldn\u2019t your husband go to the graduation ceremony without you?\n\nYeah, OP says it was out of loyalty to her, but... what about his loyalty to his own daughter?  No one's gonna tell me I can't watch my daughter graduate.", "NTA, \n\nshe can\u2019t not want you but want your things. You come as a package, she can\u2019t chop and choose.", "All the disrespect? She didn\u2019t choose to marry his children. She was wrong in trying to parent them, but it\u2019s asinine to shift the blame on her. Are you implying that all adults are mean-spirited and manipulative to their step-parents or what?", "> Good on OP teaching a lesson that should have been taught a long time ago!\n\nTrue.\n\nHowever, when I read the post, I got the sense that OP has been competing with ex-wife for the daughter's affection. That was a foolish thing to do; the daughter's affection will likely always swing to whoever is giving her things. Besides, why would OP want to buy affection? \n\nIt is especially problematic as she was willing to buy that affection at the expense of her own children's wellbeing:\n>For a year I have kept my mouth shut about what I want done with our child because every time I tell her hey please don\u2019t feed him chocolate at 6 months old she freaks out and leaves\n\nTLDR: I don't think OP was wise. And definitely not as altruistic in her motives as she portrays.\n\nESH", "NTA. OP, I truly feel the anguish you feel in this post but as you said, his kids mentally and emotionally manipulate him, while he holds your children to a whole different standard. Let that sink in. \n\nUntil your husband can understand that he needs healthy boundaries with his kids, he's stranded you on the fence within this 'blended' family. They want what they want from you when they need you, but when you have reasonable boundaries you're some harpy? No, that doesn't track, OP. It's past time for some change.\n\nYou have two children and apparently an infant to raise. You can't do any more for your stepchildren. That means financially, mentally, or emotionally especially when their love comes with a price.\n\nLet your husband and his ex wife parent his children without your money, time, or input. Ask yourself, how is it that this girl's own mother could take away a car and it's cool and you're being berated when your stepdaughter has decided that she doesn't want you in her life? If he can't develop the necessary line with his older children, then you need to focus on creating a healthy environment for your children, even if that means no longer being with your husband.\n\nI'm sorry for your situation, OP. May you take the correct path.", "I\u2019d be careful. A lot of people are being reactive towards your SD but there may be something below the surface. Stick to your guns but handle with care. Her mom may be trying to stir the pot or maybe she is simply jealous of the baby. She may see you as more of a mother. She may just be an AH but all of her energy is directed at you for a reason.", "Take the car back. Cut service to the phone. Tell your husband to grow a goddam spine and tell her to sling her hook if she's going to try and manipulate the pair of you because she's a jealous little...I'll leave it there as this is making me SO angry. Please just get the car back, remove her from your phone plan and cut the fucker loose. She's going to be even more trouble in future and your husband should be protecting you and your children from this child.", "This is also my reaction.  NTA based on what\u2019s in the post but it doesn\u2019t feel right. Also notice how all of the things OP mentions that she\u2019s done for the stepdaughter are about money and material things? nothing about their actual relationship. Doesn\u2019t feel right", "Your husband, honestly he needs to grow a pair and stand up to her and her stupid demands. You really need to take the car and phone back. Actions and words have consequences and these are hers. You did so much for her and she throws it back in your face. In future let daddy deal with them and you focus on your young ones. It's not a healthy dynamic and it's unlikely to change while her mother's pulling her strings.", "Her husband missed his kid\u2019s graduation because he choose his wife over his kid. The Ex played a game and dad picked his wife over the kid.", "I'm just saying if she married a man with no children then she wouldn't be having these problems right now. She signed up for all this crap when she married the man", "Wait. You think OP (stepmom) is competing with biomom for the child's attention? And you think the child would choose stepmom over biomon just because of material things? Only if that kid is the most shallow kid in the universe and/or if biomom is a horrible mother", "But if they claimed her, why aren't they helping with school costs? What does the custody agreement between your husband and his ex reference when it comes to college education? Usually it's some mix between the two parents.", "No, she didn't.", "Stepmom is indeed competing with biomum. Every time biomum takes back a phone / car, stepmom comes to the rescue to give it to the child. In what world is a car a necessity?\n\nAnd it does appear that the child is shallow. After all, OP said that the child throws tantrums if she is asked not to give the 6 year old baby chocolate milk:\n>every time I tell her hey please don\u2019t feed him chocolate at 6 months old she freaks out and leaves\n\nAlso:\n>I told her not to let our 15 month old drink from her straw because she was sick. She then told her dad to choose between me or her", "Actually she did. You can't marry a family man and not expect his children to be fully in his life too. It takes a strong person to marry into an already made family.", "If both of these statements are true (that stepmom is competing for affection AND the kid is THAT shallow), then I feel really sorry for all parties involved. For one thing, I'm not sure that stepmom cares as much about the child's attention as she cares about showing up biomom. Either way, it's a sick dynamic. And if the kid is THAT shallow, she has no future. There clearly are no adults in her life who are mature enough to set an example or give her guidance on how to become a proper adult", "But they shouldn't be disrespecting her after all she's done for them, either. Ffs what is wrong with you people? She's an entitled, selfish brat. SM should take back the phone and car and tell her to sling her hook. Honestly!", "We only have a little bit of insight into the family's complicated dynamics. Our take may be wrong.\n\nHowever, based on what OP said, the child in question appears to be spoiled and vindictive. And OP appears to be trying to win the child's affection with material things, except it will be a losing battle since biomum is much wealthier. \n\nI found it concerning that OP was permitting some questionable behavior (stepdaughter giving baby sugary drinks) in order to keep the peace and win stepdaughter's affection."]}
