But ultimately, the kids are the real victims here. They don't want or need to see you and your ex fighting back and forth. Do you have a custody agreement on paper? If not, you need to get one. This whole drop them off at this time, pick them up on this day, isn't working.", "Sounds like you're both weaponizing your children. Please stop. ESH", "ESH. This tit-for-tat shit you\u2019re playing with your kids is going to bite you hard in the ass someday. Sucks he had an affair, but co-parenting issues takes precedence over hurt feelings. Y\u2019all need to get it together.", "Your **KIDS** are the ones suffering here. Sure, play stupid games back and forth but just remember that the collateral damage is your kid's wellbeing, belief - that all kids should grow up with - that the adults in their life can act like adults, not petty children, and that their parents actually do love them. Not that they've now become a pawn in a game between their formerly married parents to hurt each other. That really fucks up a kid's self-worth.\n\nESH except the kids.", "Ew, he asked you to come pick them up from the wedding?? No. Surely an aunt or grandparent can drop them off at your house as a compromise. Warning tho, sounds like you guys are putting your kids in the middle of your personal issues and that is not cool. ESH.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re both being trashy, using your children to score points against each other.", "ESH you both decided to have kids together. Your kids should come before all of this.", "I think that him asking you to pick them up from the wedding is an asshole move and you refusing to take them is also an asshole move. Maybe compromise by seeing if a neutral family member that is attending the wedding can drive the kids to your house or a designated site that is not the wedding. ESH.", "ESH.  Don't put the children in the middle of it.", "ESH\n\nI get that it would be uncomfortable to go to the hotel (which I\u2019m assuming is the wedding venue) to pick the kids up and it\u2019s a horrible move for him to ask you to granted the circumstances. \n\nHowever these are your kids and there\u2019s no need to \u201cinconvenience\u201d you ex by refusing to take them back.  Tell him he should drop them off at the agreed upon time or you can come get them the next day.", "ESH. Him trying to blindside you by arranging for you to pick up the children from his wedding venue is beyond AH-lic, given that he is marrying the woman he cheated on you with. I can\u2019t imagine how hurtful that is, and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. He is just so far out of line here.\n\nYour knee-jerk reaction is totally understandable - not just because of what he tried to do with the wedding but for previously turning his children away at 7.30pm. As a parent, I can\u2019t imagine denying my minor children entry to my home at any time. \n\nThat said, you aren\u2019t doing the right thing by your children by making them feel like burdens on a wedding night. And you\u2019re sending the message that you\u2019re not reliable - you didn\u2019t stick to the deal you made with their dad. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be tough not to sink to his level, but don\u2019t do it. You may not feel like you are gaining anything by taking the higher road now, but your children will gain from it now and will remember how you acted in the future. \n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d either get someone else to pick them up from the hotel or march in there with my head held high and a wedding gift in hand from the children. I wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of showing the world that I was rattled at all.  Your ex is an outsized AH, based on the way he has treated you and his children, so time to celebrate AP getting a lifetime of exactly what she deserves! \n\nThis is maybe a big change for your children too, and your husband sounds like a terrible communicator, so goodness knows what he has told them. As much as you might be angry or hurt right now, please take time to check that they know what to expect, whether they are worried about anything and what they  want you to do that day to make them feel like the important parts of their worlds are still safe spaces. \n\nGood luck. You are a hero for putting up with a man like that. And an even bigger one for getting a divorce when things weren\u2019t working for you.", "NTA\n\nIf this is the way you need to start saying no, when you were only saying yes to appease him, or make him happy, then so be it. \n\nIt\u2019s not ideal and you need therapy and establish boundaries for yourself and for the sake of your kids\n\nUnpopular vote - but NTA and don\u2019t back down.", "NTA.

You would have blindsided had you not found out ahead of time.", "ESH.\n\nStop weaponizing your children. Both of you. It doesn\u2019t matter that he cheated or was awful, that\u2019s on him, not on the kids.", "NTA. Period.", "NTA - My goodness, he wants his way all the time by lying via omission.  Allow him to figure out the change of plans since he sneaked around during your marriage and continues secrecy of his marriage. He's a user waiting for an opportunity.\n\nThose posting you're weaponizing the kids....they will be fine. It's a wedding and certainly someone will be watching them. Kids: Eat sugar, Dance, Make memories.", "ESH. Use a coparenting app to track everything. Do what is right for your kids. Get over yourselves.", "Overall I definitely think your ex is a massive AH.  In this instance, YTA too.  You agreed to pick up the children months ago.  You agreed to pick them up from the hotel.  It sounds like you're only changing your mind to ruin his wedding night, which is an AH move.  Don't get me wrong, I hope he has a miserable marriage and she cheats on him.  However, in this case, you are stooping to his level.", "YTA. Don\u2019t weaponize your children.", "Who cares how he treated you in the past? Your fucking up your kids life.

That's such a shitty and potentially damaging thing to do to them.", "In this one very particular scenario NTA. Don\u2019t use your kids as bargaining chips and don\u2019t punish them to hurt their Dad. But I think refusing to take them on his wedding night when he can\u2019t even acknowledge that\u2019s why he wants you to pick them up is ok. He will be fine having to find his own childcare that one night, he asked the the kids that day, he can figure out the who day. \n\nEvery other time\u2026. Don\u2019t do this.  But giving the screws just once when he can\u2019t even be honest with you, I just can\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole for that.", "YTA.  You are using your kids as weapons to get petty revenge on your ex.  Did you think about how the kids will feel when they find out mom backed out and doesn\u2019t want them anymore?  It\u2019s not likely it\u2019s likely to mess up his wedding night anyway, he\u2019ll find a relative or friend to watch them overnight and you won\u2019t get to say boo about it because you already refused to take them.", "YTA. It's your kids. You're punishing them for something he did long enough ago.", "This guy sucks, but YTA. Your kids should never ever ever be used as any kind of parental power play.

Great, now the kids can tell that neither of their parents wants to take them.", "Nta say to him his new blended family should all be there minus you\n\nAnd also say \"gee I guess you should have allowed me to drop off the kids that night huh\"", "ESH. \n\nYou're both miserable parents that are just using their kids to hurt each other.
