Sadly", "And really, the fucked adults are just unhealed children in grownup bodies.", "Why else would the need to be picked up? They\u2019ll see it as being kicked out. It\u2019s a hotel. If they\u2019re older, get them a room and ask for a pickup after family breakfast. Assign an aunt to care for them. I was 23 when I met my dad\u2019s girlfriend (at their wedding, where I was best man) and I\u2019m still grateful to my aunt who sat down at the dinner after, handed me a tequila shot and said \u2018so, being a grownup kinda sucks, huh? This is a good thing, let\u2019s drink\u2019 I can\u2019t imagine doing that as a kid who needs to be picked up from the wedding.", "Don't have kids with this mentality please. I would seek counseling first, you could hurt a human being in ways you truly don't, or wont care about.  Opinions on a forum or not, its problematic.", "The kids won\u2019t be fine. It\u2019s very obvious that they are being used as pawns in their parents fights. That leaves lasting effects on kids.", "So that gives her the right to use her kids as a weapon? So long as she was spurned, her kids\u2019 needs and emotions come second? \n\nSounds like the kind of mindset that\u2019ll end up with a one-way trip to the nursing home in a few decades.", "No, she just wanted you to go stay with your stepmother who hated you instead. As if that's better.", "I'd take time with my kid any time whether it inconvenienced the ex or not. Even if he's going through that rebellious stage right now. The gray hair he gives me just makes me look distinguished. ;-)", "I assumed it was so the dad and new wife could have a honeymoon. Not necessarily that the kids were being kicked out or leaving unreasonably early.\n\nHe should have arranged childcare instead of trying to have a secret wedding and expecting his ex to babysit so he can spend alone time with his former mistress. That being said, if it\u2019s something OP was willing to do before she knew the purpose, it doesn\u2019t seem like watching the kids is too much of an inconvenience in and of itself. So her not taking them and focusing on the positive of extra time with them does come off as a bit petty.", "I had a car service take me home from my dads wedding when I was 14. He also married his mistress. I wasn\u2019t happy about the wedding per day haha but didn\u2019t feel kicked out having to go home in the evening. I didn\u2019t want to party into the night with a bunch of drunk grown ups. No thank you. They sent me back to my mom\u2019s in a cool car and I was perfectly fine with it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Everyone\u2019s different \ud83d\ude43", "choosing to pick your kids up the next day because you dont wanna trigger horrible trauma by literally showing up to the wedding of the woman that fucked and stole your husband from you is not the same as using your kids as pawns.\n\nSome people cant handle emotional stress on that level. I know if I showed up blindly to their wedding as her not knowing that was what the event was, it wouldnt be pretty. Id be calling that woman every name in the book.", "Not sure why you think you know the whole situation better than the person who literally lived it and JUST SAID it wouldn\u2019t have happened had her mother known.", "I didn't say that she was doing was something right. She said sorry and she is not with us. She may have had a tumor in her brain, which was cancer and was the cause of her passing.", "Yeah I just can\u2019t imagine her having to literally pull up to the wedding and collect her children. She can spend the time with them but somebody\u2019s gotta drop them off, that\u2019s crazy.", "Right. You got a special thing to take care of you. (Unless you took car service all the time?) either way, you have a good memory from it. And that\u2019s what matters.", "Your mom made a mistake and apologized for it, something adults don\u2019t do nearly enough (apologizing to kids I mean). The person who replied to you has zero place hijacking your experience and being rude. Yeah, your mom made a mistake, but she owned up to it and apologized. I\u2019m sorry this person was so rude and obnoxious towards you. I\u2019m sorry your mother passed. I hope her exit from this life was gentle and that the two of you had a good relationship.\n\nI think people could learn a thing or two from your mom. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them and apologize. It\u2019s important to show that vulnerability to children and acknowledge mistakes, to hold yourself accountable and make changes to do better. It sounds like in that instance your mom did those things and good on her for that. Her ability to own up to it, apologize, and go forward with it in mind says a lot about her in my mind. Knowing how to apologize and make your actions match your words is important, seems like she did just that in that instance.\n\nIgnore the person who responded so rudely to you, you know your experiences better and they have no place acting like they know anything more than what you put in a a couple sentences. Not like I know any better either, I\u2019m just commenting about how her actions in that instance can contribute to a bigger picture.", "This is the most coherent reply to something personal, I've read in a while. Thanks for that."]}
