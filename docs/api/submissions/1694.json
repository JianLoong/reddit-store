I understand you love the movies and that you feel joy when you can share films you love with others. However, trying to dictate *how* you share a film you love with someone else as well as how *they experience* that film is over the top. Some people prefer to be spoiled prior to watching things. You may not understand it - but that's their choice, not yours. \n\nAnd with all due respect, it is odd that you feel your own enjoyment of re-watching the films would be ruined by your brother simply not being completely surprised by everything that happens when he watches them for the first time.

One important thing to mention, just like your brother, I keep the information to myself. I know people don't like spoilers, so any information I have, I don't share. \n\nMy husband is slightly bothered by this. I don't understand why he cares, it really doesn't impact him or his perception of the show in any way.

As long as your brother respects your boundaries and never ruins your experience by telling you plot-stuff in advance, you need to accept his preferences. \n\nYou mistakenly believe that you are enhancing his experience by not knowing the twist, however do you ever have movies that you watch and then you think \"I need to watch this a 2nd time to understand it\"?

That's just how he processes things.

His choice to keep doing it if he wants to though.\n\nLikewise, you gave him a heads up that he was making this less fun, and that's perfectly fair.

Not my loss, i enjoyed the view. \n\nIn all these examples you would maybe be pissed bc you wanted a special experience for someone and they are not appreciative of it from your pov and with that ruined the experience for you too.

My husband, like you, likes to see how I blind react. How do we get over it? Communicate.

From my experience with my brother I\u2019m nearly positive he Googles things that happen because he is impatient with the movies timing, not because a character death will mess with his day. This normally doesn\u2019t affect me and I don\u2019t bother him about it. In this case, due to the length of the series, I\u2019m a bit more bothered. But I get it.

I couldn't care less about spoilers. It doesn't affect how I watch the movie or show in any way. In fact, a lot of spoilers actually make me *want* to watch it even more. Maybe he's the same way?\n\nThe only thing you can really do here is ask him to just, not tell you that he googled something about the movie.\n\nIf he stills chooses to tell you he did that, then he's the AH.", "YTA \n\nSorry, but certain movies make me anxious unless I already know the plot. You have no right to dictate his choosing to spoil the movies for himself and only himself.", "NTA if he wants to spoil good movies for himself he can do it on his own time. So frustrating watching movies with someone like that - why even bother watching of you're going to Google the ending???", "YTA. I struggle to enjoy a movie if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.

I don't like movies, and it is so hard for me to care about watching an entire movie without knowing about the plot. I don't Google it, but I can understand.  I also can't care to pay attention to the entire thing usually, so I get distracted and miss huge parts, which, if I'm alone, I'll rewind as needed but I usually watch movies with other people.", "YTA\n\nGoogling for himself in no way hurts you, as long as he isn't spoiling things by telling you. It's not a silly argument, though, because it's a problem that you are so controlling of other people's viewing experiences. Reading spoilers doesn't prevent people from loving a good movie.", "YTA. Him googling the movies before or while watching has zero impact on you. You\u2019re nuts for thinking that it does. You can\u2019t control how he enjoys something. There was a study I read a long time ago that said people enjoy movies more if they have been spoiled. Basically because someone knows the ending/knows the twists they can sit back and enjoy it instead of trying to figure it out. Instead of trying to find hidden meaning in something two scenes back and missing whats going on in the current scene they can focus on what\u2019s happening and pick up all the subtle clues and see how they\u2019ll lead to the ending.

Have you considered asking him why he prefers to google things?", "YTA.  I understand wanting someone to have the \"proper\" movie experience, there are series and films where I absolutely tell people not to spoil themselves.  But he's not spoiling other people, just himself, so why not just let him watch movies the way he likes?  I also will frequently Google movie or TV show plots ahead of time, either because I can't wait to know, or because I want to know ahead of time if a movie is going to upset me or piss me off.  Like, it makes it a more pleasant experience for me if I know that the character I like won't be killed off (or, if they will be killed off, I can mentally prepare for it).  For some of us, like me and your brother, spoilers don't reduce our enjoyment at all - if anything, it can enhance enjoyment. \n\nAlso, you are talking about the Harry Potter movies here, they're not exactly high art films, and they've been part of popular culture for so long a lot of people have already been \"spoiled\" without seeing a single one.  If this really bothers you, maybe you could compromise.  Like, ask him to sit through just ONE movie where the twist is really important (like Shutter Island), and in exchange for that, relax about the other movies.  Harry Potter has some good twists, but it's still a good story if you know what's coming.", "It depends, is your brother neuro divergent at all?

Definitely not an asshole for just *not* sharing the movie watching experience with him. Would be an asshole if you force him to watch a movie with you without letting him Google it but just taking movies out of the equation is fine.", "He does, it\u2019s happened before. I have several core memories of us watching movies together for the first time and I\u2019ll talk with him and guess around about what happens next in the films and then he\u2019ll tell me after the movies he knew what was going to happen all along.", "One other thing I think you should take on board as well: you say that you go out of your way to ensure someone has a good experience with a film, but you don\u2019t seem to be taking into account what actually makes it a good experience for *them*.

You\u2019re being super ableist in addition to being a control freak.", "Because finding layers of a great movie is a lot of fun.

As for it being rude, I think it depends on the group. With my family it's not uncommon for people to be on their phone/tablet when watching tv together.

The only thing he might be ruining is his own experience of seeing it for the first time.. you've seen the movies - it's not like he can spoil it for you. This is 100% a YOU thing.", "NTA. I understand the joy of sharing someone's first exposure to something you love. ITs a way of reexperiencing your own joy of that first viewing. Tell your brother his habit of googling the plot and surprises of a movie, just as its ok for you to want to enjoy someone being surprised as they watch a movie that you love. The issue here isn't who is wrong  or right, but rather you two realizing that with your opposing idiosyncrasies, watching movies that your bro hasn't seen are incompatible. I think that there are lots of folks that like to \"read the last chapter first\" and I think they are the minority but conversely those that get joy from sharing someone's first viewing of something they've already seen is also a minority.
