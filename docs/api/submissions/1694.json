Normally this doesn\u2019t affect me and I just let him do his thing; however, I prefer it if he doesn\u2019t Google the ending to something I\u2019m showing him. It siphons the joy out of showing him a movie if he Googles the ending. I love my brother and despite our different quirks we spend a lot of time together.\n\nRecently he mentioned he wanted to see the Harry Potter movies for the first time. I haven\u2019t seen them in about 6 years. My wife and I were planning a watch through anyway. We invited my brother over and watched the first movie with no trouble. A few days later, while watching the second movie, my brother advised he Googled Tom Riddle because he saw a post on Facebook about it. If you haven\u2019t seen the second HP movie, just know that Googling and reading about TR will spoil a twist. I don\u2019t fault him for this Google search because he was prompted by a post and didn\u2019t know any better; however, when I asked him to please avoid Googling anything else about HP until we finished the series, he told me no. He stated he can Google whatever he wants and it doesn\u2019t affect me. The callous way he made this statement with no regard towards the impact his actions have on other people hurt me a lot. We invited him over to our home and showed him something we care about just to have him sit there and Google what comes next.\n\nI did my best to explain how I want him to experience the story without diluting it with haphazard Google searches spoiling key points. One of the great joys in my life is finding a movie I think someone will love and showing it to them. The situation became extremely stressful for me. My wife and I aren\u2019t sure we want to invite him back over to watch any more of the HP movies. We both think HP would be more peaceful with just us two.\n\nI understand the only \u201cfirst time\u201d watch through experience being ruined is his, so maybe I shouldn\u2019t care. He knows how far out of my way I will go to insure someone has a good experience with a film. I don\u2019t think he is refusing to promise simply to antagonize me; however, he knows exactly how antagonized I will be and he has chosen to do it anyway.\n\nI also understand this might seem like it\u2019s just a silly sibling argument about a movie. I wouldn\u2019t be making this post if he hadn\u2019t stated, and I quote, \u201cWould you be open to selecting an unbiased arbiter (someone we both know & agree on) to determine if it is indeed a reasonable expectation?\u201d In reference to my expectation of not Googling a movie someone wants you to experience. If he wants to read what happens on Wikipedia he can do it at his own house while the movies drone on in the background.

One important thing to mention, just like your brother, I keep the information to myself. I know people don't like spoilers, so any information I have, I don't share. \n\nMy husband is slightly bothered by this. I don't understand why he cares, it really doesn't impact him or his perception of the show in any way. His argument is that he cannot discuss with me topics such as \"I wonder what X will do next, I wonder what the motivation behind Y is\" etc. \n\nYou need to understand that there are people out there that love to read spoilers. As long as your brother respects your boundaries and never ruins your experience by telling you plot-stuff in advance, you need to accept his preferences. \n\nYou mistakenly believe that you are enhancing his experience by not knowing the twist, however do you ever have movies that you watch and then you think \"I need to watch this a 2nd time to understand it\"?

I don\u2019t think you have the right to decide how he enjoys a movie, and to not invite him because he doesn\u2019t do it your way is an AH move.

His choice to keep doing it if he wants to though.\n\nLikewise, you gave him a heads up that he was making this less fun, and that's perfectly fair.

Unless talks alot while the movie is on \"I googled this and that\" (that would be annoying) \nOr if he goggles while watching the movie. \nWich one of the last lines \"he can do the googling at his own house while the movie zones in the background\" could indicate.\nThen it's rude tbh. In the sense of, you come over to have a great night and watch a movie but you sit mostly with your phone googling stuff and not are not even watching the movie.", "I Google/Wikipedia everything I watch. From TV shows to movies I see in the theater. It feels like I've always done it, but since smart phones are relatively new, I know that there had to be a point where I started but I have no idea when.  I also have EXTREME anxiety (and depression... cant have one without the other, right?). I never made the connection to my Googling everything being connected to my anxiety but it makes soooo much sense. In real life I am constantly worried about what is going to happen. I guess knowing what is going to happen in TV and Movies makes me feel a little safer ? while watching them. Very interesting.", "This is true", ">People googling the plot is actually really common for people that have anxiety, you don\u2019t mention if your bro does but it\u2019s not some weird out there thing.\n\nCan also confirm.\n\nI do this with series as well. Especially if a conflict is arising, I need the spoiler to ease my anxiety.\n\nIf your brother is not actively spoiling the ending for you, then YTA.\n\nAlso this:\n\n>One of the great joys in my life is finding a movie I think someone will love and showing it to them\n\nKinda rubs me the wrong way. Do you, like, need validation from other people about things that you like? Or does it make you feel special and important if you introduce a movie to someone & they like it?\n\nA very weird hill to die on.", "THANK YOU! This is a whole discussion between me and literally anyone I tell that I prefer spoilers... I hate the whole \"don't tell me what happens\" thing thats going on with movies and Series, like if I haven't seen a show in 2 years pls just tell me what happens because I will most likely never go back to watching it anyway. Also If the movie looks interesting but starts of boring I'll give it a little read through on wikipedia just so I know if it is worth to watch. It is still pleasant to watch even if I know what will happen throughout the movie.", "I mean, yes. I showed a friend Star Wars once and they were genuinely shocked when they found out Luke was Darth Vader\u2019s son. Some people live under rocks. I get that IATA in this situation but 20 year old films can definitely be spoiled. Most people don\u2019t consume all media that has ever been released. I watched Twilight when I had Covid and I had absolutely no clue what was going to happen (which didn\u2019t make the movies any better in all honesty).", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from. Like I said in the OP, it\u2019s a silly sibling thing. This situation is more like the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. He does this with everything and he has spoiled things for me before which has left a bitter taste in my mouth in regards to him Googling things. But we\u2019ll obviously get past this like we always do when we have disagreements. Like you implied, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. I\u2019ll get over myself shortly.", "Yes, in this case he isn\u2019t spoiling anything for me. He has before with other movies. I\u2019ve seen the movies so it\u2019s not really a possibility here aside from the details I\u2019ve forgotten.", "I do\nIt makes want to see the scenes\nI get excited for characters that i heard so much about\nI also usually du research before starting a shoe", "I don't agree with your comparison of the situation. OP did not create the films, and it is weird he is taking it so personally imo. \n\nDoesn't sound like he is giving out spoilers to movies? He just Googles what's next? Sounds like they have different ways of enjoying a movie. \n\nYou are right he is entitled to invite him over or not, but I get the impression that OP is one of they people who is so focused on people having a \"good experience\" but his only reference point of that, is the thing he personally enjoys, not what his guest actually enjoys.", "That's what I thought but it wasn't explicitly stated. Honestly, the OP is being a bit of an AH, why impose that rule on anyone else?", "It made a lot of sense when I came across it and made me feel less strange \ud83d\ude43\n\nThe other thing I read was about people with anxiety having comfort shows that they rewatch rather than getting into a new series. There are no surprises and they know it\u2019s a safe show.\n\nI do that too.", "I was about to write something similar. I generally don\u2019t like surprises due to wonderful ADHD related things like anxiety and depression. I cannot watch movies that involve jump scares and horror, even if I know what\u2019s going to happen. On the odd occasion I have, I was then awake for the next 2 days. \n\nOp, YTA.", "Same here. It also helps with my anxiety.", "That's generally the outliers though, I actually meant the information is freely and easily available on the internet in the form of memes, reviews, plot summaries on the internet. \nThe only way to make Twilight better is to decide which characters should be played by drag queens and picture that from then on. Rosalie? Actually a fabulous drag queen. All the werewolves? Drag queens. Bella? DRAG QUEEN.", "There are so many stupid arguments to be had with siblings, this one doesn\u2019t seem worth it. Let it go:)", "As long as he doesn't spoil anything for you, YTA if you try and control him not to. It's literally not effecting you him knowing it. That being said if it does bother you that much NTA for not watching films with him.", "I am exactly that same way! When I went through a really bad spell a few months back I watched the Big Bang Theory CONSTANTLY. It was always on. And there are a few new shows that I want to watch but cannot bring myself to start them. I go back to shows I've seen many times before and just rewatch them. It's amazing how much anxiety affects your life without you even being aware of it."]}
