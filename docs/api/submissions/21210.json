Also the judgement over his job. They availed of people like my dad all the time to fix their cars and yet they judge him for doing it.", "Double weddings are pretty rare and no one needs to justify why they don't want one. Life rarely imitates Pride and Prejudice, with Elizabeth and Jane Bennett having a double marriage to Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley.\n\nBut also, to the extent that people want to reconcile with family, a big event like a wedding is a terrible forum for it. If a reconciliation is ever going to happen, it will occur in a more private setting. Weddings, let alone double weddings, are extremely busy events for the principals, not conducive for a meeting of long sundered minds.\n\nSister is fairly delusional. Ignore her.", "I think in this case, at least somewhat, it's because of how my sister was encouraged to correct me and to think she could make decisions for me (like how many dads I have). So that now that we're both adults she thinks she knows what would be best and that I should listen to her. There is also a large part I am guessing where she wants this whole dream reality of us all being one big happy family.\n\nThank you. So far it's looking like our wedding will be between 20 and 30 people and that sounds ideal to me.", "It's something I have had to give some serious thought to and the answer is yes. The truth is I feel like this is me getting off lightly and that when I start to (hopefully) have children, it will become an even bigger battle. She will say my kids deserve to know \"their grandparents\" and that as a mom I should be more understanding and forgiving. Overall I think if she refuses to accept the way things are and if she continues trying to push what she thinks is right for me onto me, going no contact will be the only option I could consider. I'd like to not do that but it would be naive to think it's not something that will possibly need to happen.", "Yeah they're snobs", "Ah yes, that makes sense now that you say it. Well, I hope you can get her to back off without it causing too much trouble.

Sit with her and tell her firmly your decision.  Also your stepdad really sucks, bribing you to call him 'dad' right in front of your dad and your mom never putting a stop to it makes me think your mom and stepdad are truly birds of the same feather.", "YTA  for not having your wedding be all about your sister, her wants, her happiness and her fake family repair.\n\nBut seriously, in what level of hell would this wedding be held at for you and you dad? Does your sister think she can waive a magic wedding wand and it will erase all the douchebaggery from you stepdad and 'go for it hun' attitude from your mom to allow him to behave that way to you?\n\nHill to die on my friend.

The guests at a wedding are absolutely able to ruin the wedding, so saying \u2018the guest list shouldn\u2019t stop you\u2019 just shows a lack of foresight and almost sounds manipulative by reducing the confrontation between you and your family to just \u2018the guest list\u2019. \n\nIt\u2019s even more relevant to not want to have a double wedding when you KNOW the people invited are going to ruin it for you.

I remember when she was younger strangers would think i am her mom and i was always correcting, getting sometimes into a discussion for no reason, so at 1 point I just asked her what she prefered and she said she doesn't mind people thniking i am her mom and no need for correction.
