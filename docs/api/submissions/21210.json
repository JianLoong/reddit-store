Dad had equal custody of us and I was always much closer to him. Sierra was close to him as well. I would say I was closer.

I can understand family having a small amount of input but deciding that you're having a double wedding and inviting a bunch of people that you don't like is a bit much.

That's her issue.  She has no claim to tell you what to do with your wedding.  \n\nI'm wondering if your sister continues to press this nonsense if you will consider going no contact with her as well.\n\nYour wedding, your rules.  Do it your way, OP, and keep your mom and stepdad away, just as you always intended.

A double wedding sounds like trouble in general.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t get your sister. It\u2019s not that hard to understand why you don\u2019t want your mom and her husband on your wedding. She seems to think only about herself.\n\nThe guest list shouldnt be a reason ? Okay then don\u2019t invite mom and hubby. Lets see how fast she will take that statement back.", "NTA and also, who even has double weddings these days? I've literally never even heard of a single case where anyone had a double wedding and wasn't driven to it by desperate reasons.", "I cannot possibly fathom where you would be TA here.", "Nta sounds like sierra needs to be uninvited", "Nta\n\nHave a wedding and put Sierra on a block list for it.", "It is. Also the judgement over his job. They availed of people like my dad all the time to fix their cars and yet they judge him for doing it.", "Double weddings are pretty rare and no one needs to justify why they don't want one. Life rarely imitates Pride and Prejudice, with Elizabeth and Jane Bennett having a double marriage to Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley.\n\nBut also, to the extent that people want to reconcile with family, a big event like a wedding is a terrible forum for it. If a reconciliation is ever going to happen, it will occur in a more private setting. Weddings, let alone double weddings, are extremely busy events for the principals, not conducive for a meeting of long sundered minds.\n\nSister is fairly delusional. Ignore her.", "I think in this case, at least somewhat, it's because of how my sister was encouraged to correct me and to think she could make decisions for me (like how many dads I have). So that now that we're both adults she thinks she knows what would be best and that I should listen to her. There is also a large part I am guessing where she wants this whole dream reality of us all being one big happy family.\n\nThank you. So far it's looking like our wedding will be between 20 and 30 people and that sounds ideal to me.", "It's something I have had to give some serious thought to and the answer is yes. The truth is I feel like this is me getting off lightly and that when I start to (hopefully) have children, it will become an even bigger battle. She will say my kids deserve to know \"their grandparents\" and that as a mom I should be more understanding and forgiving. Overall I think if she refuses to accept the way things are and if she continues trying to push what she thinks is right for me onto me, going no contact will be the only option I could consider. I'd like to not do that but it would be naive to think it's not something that will possibly need to happen.", "Yeah they're snobs", "Ah yes, that makes sense now that you say it. Well, I hope you can get her to back off without it causing too much trouble. Her \"dream day\" can't come at the expense of you being miserable on what's supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life.", "Friends are the universe's way of apologizing for your family.\n\nIf you don't like the family you have, make your own.\n\nKnow your boundaries, OP, and defend them with all your heart and will.", "Yeah, and a mix of \"the ex can't be good enough so let's shit on what he does\".", "Yes, exactly. Our dreams do not align and that's okay. That's why single weddings in one day exist.", "Diabolical behaviour"]}
