You gave her her redemption process, don\u2019t do it again. . . . Don\u2019t lie on me or about me. . . . If she had agreed to that then you might be able to forgive her in time if her behavior shows improvement.  She has to earn forgiveness from you and if it were me, I would make it pretty hard and take my sweet time.

Keeping the cameras a secret.", "An apology does not obligate you to forgive. NTA", "NTA. Keep up your strategy with having everything over text or witnessed. She's problematic and so is your son, as he obviously enables her lies or at least doesn't take enough of a stand against them, or respect that you've been victimized. You don't need to forgive her - it's an ongoing pattern of behavior. Maybe when she truly apologizes and stops lying and makes amends, you can say you forgive her. You can accept an apology, but you don't have to forgive immediately - this is your own timeline.", "To me, saying not to do it again is basically say I forgive you this time, but I won't next time.  I don't know where they get the anger from?  Forgiveness comes in many forms.  Did she actually apologize and show actual remorse?  I'm not much younger than you and have learned that sometimes you have to put people at a distance, no matter who they are.  You are NTA, but she definitely is TA.", "I'm a firm believer that a sincere apology still stands even if it's not accepted. In other words, if someone says \"I'm sorry\" and the other person says \"I won't forgive you, I'll die cursing your name on my lips\", the person who apologized will understand and *remain* sorry. An apology that is revoked when not accepted is not a true apology,  it's a performance. You didn even say you'd never forgive her, you gave an acceptable response that neither accepted nor rejected her words. \n\nI don't care about the backstory. She didn't mean her words. NTA.", "NTA. Have you forgiven her? If not it'd be weird to say \"I forgive you\" and she's not automatically owed immediate forgiveness for any and every shitty thing she does.", "It doesn't sound as though you did anything to incite her behavior. Your DIL lashing out and blatantly lying to your entire family, claiming you said some very nasty things to her simply because you denied her a request (for a valid reason, yet) is unacceptable.\n\nWhat she did was petty, manipulative and malicious, and you responded quite calmly and practically. She can face some public scorn as the reasonsble consequence of her own actions.\n\nI can't really understand your son's POV here, \"don't do it again\" is a sound acknowledgement of her apology\u2014 she isn't owed your forgiveness just because she said sorry, what she did was wrong and she knows it. Your response wasn't cruel or even unfair.\n\nPerhaps you could have thanked her for the apology or said that you appreciated it, to verbally acknowledge what she said. Not saying so might have been seen as rude or that you were ignoring the apology outright, which might explain his response. Hopefully that wasn't your intention. Civility is important in establishing respectful communication, it's important to be the mature and polite one in a disagreement, particularly one where someone else is disrespectful. But if she hasn't truly earned your forgiveness by actually changing her behaviour or somehow showing she is genuinely sorry, you don't have to *forgive* her. The distinction is important.\n\nNTA, it depends a bit on how you communicated your answer and how that was taken, but in the end, \"let off on a warning\" was a perfectly acceptable consequence for your DIL.

Your DIL is very manipulative and you had every right to tell her what you did.  Does your family even realize what she did here?  What a brat.", "NTA\n\nShe is hella toxic and manipulative and he should get away from her damn that\u2019s some next level BSing", "NTA. You don't forgive her, nor should you, unless and until her behavior actually changes. She tried to cause a rift in your family with her lies and she's really only sorry she got caught.

If she apologized sincerely, you should have just said that you forgive her. You are on your way to losing your son if you keep acting like this and sound like a future bad MIL if you don't turn things around. No visits from your son or with future grandkids. It was unreasonable for her to assume you would let her use her dress (again, what caused her to think this...did you son perhaps tell her she could or did you say something she misunderstood)?

And the remedy that forgiveness brings is for the person who has been wronged. What does it matter to the person at fault? It doesn't mean you'll now give them what they want. It doesn't mean you'll start trusting them. It doesn't mean anything more than the fact you've let go of the hurt.\n\nApologising in the expectation of forgiveness is manipulation. \n\nYou already sound like you have a handle on future interactions.

She broke everyone's trust, you are not obliged to forgive and yet you were the bigger person and accepted her apologies (I would not believe in her). If she really wants to be forgiven, she needs to work on that. She is the stranger trying to enter the family and she messed up big.\n\nI stand by your side, you were very much nicer than she deserved.\n\nI'm confused about something, you mentioned that you are 44, in an odd way, you also referred that you started to text to avoid misunderstandings. May I ask if she ever tried to imply that you had inappropriate behaviour for your age? Or that you did something when you were younger that would have been less respectful?\n\nI'm seeing many red flags around her, and your text suggests that this incident wasn't the first one.

On season 24 of survivor, there was this one contestant named Colton that lied, manipulated, bullied, and intimidated everyone to turn them against each to get control of people. His tactic was isolating them and getting in their head. He would control the narrative, and anytime anyone had a conversation. He would go hounding them for details down to exact wording. It worked for him until he had to be evacuated off the island for \"medical reasons,\" which was later revealed he was faking it. \n\nThey brought him back a couple of seasons later. He tried the same thing, but there were a couple of other returning contestants that knew him. They decided to get along and keep each other informed of everything. After failing to get inside anyone's head, Colton basically imploded. He quit the show and ran out there in literal tears in under a week. I would imagine she wants to be told \"she is forgiven\" because it makes her feel like she has controlled the outcome of this incident. By contrast, being told not to do it again really shows her that she is not in control. \n\nIf OP really wants to accelerate where this is going.

It's just, it's dryer, it makes you feel uncomfortable and you wish to be forgiven really quickly. Most people don't like others to be mad at them. \n\nBut you don't have to forgive her. She lied, and you got bullied. It must have been exhausting and mental-health damaging. Of course you won't forgive her right now. It will take time, and bonding, and compromises.
