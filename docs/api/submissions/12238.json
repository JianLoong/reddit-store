{"id": 12238, "submission_id": "11qs519", "title": "AITA for asking my ex to rearrange a weekend with my daughters so I could look after my fianc\u00e9e?", "selftext": "I (39M) was previously married to Aya (33F). We have 2 daughters together (6F & 5F). We have been divorced for 4 years. Our custody arrangement is that I have them every other weekend and one night during the week. The one night varies every week depending out our schedules as we both work in a hospital.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e, Faith (42F), had a miscarriage last week. The miscarriage has been difficult on both of us, but Faith has really struggled. Sadly, it is something I have been through several times with Aya. I was due to have the girls at the weekend from Friday to Sunday. However Thursday night it was clear that Faith wasn't in the right head space mentally to have the girls around. I called Aya to rearrange with her, so I could have them next weekend.\n\nAya was annoyed when I called her to rearrange. We had rearranged my weekend once already as I was called into work due to it being short staffed. This was meant to be my rearranged weekend. She had plans already for the weekend, she and her boyfriend, (Sam 46M) had booked a weekend away. He'd booked a weekend away for them due to her being so run down from work, she works in an emergency department. Between that and having our girls, that doesn't leave her much time to do anything for herself. She told me that I needed to take them because she was going away. I told her that I was really sorry but that I didn't think it was a good environment for the girls to be around Faith while she is coming to terms with the miscarriage, but that it also wasn't good for Faith to have them around. Aya told me that she wasn't cancelling her plans for me and that she needed to put herself first for once.\n\nOn Friday, I didn't pick the girls up as normal. When Aya called to find out where I was, I told her that to protect Faith's mental health, we couldn't have the girls. Aya told me that if I wasn't at her's in the next 30 minutes then she was going to see her lawyer first thing on Monday to go for full custody. This is the second time since we have split that I have asked her to rearrange a weekend. I did pick up the girls in the end but Faith really struggled having them at ours and come Saturday afternoon, she went to stay at a friend's because she found it overwhelming. Aya messaged me this morning saying the girls had been upset that the weekend didn't feel like a normal fun weekend at mine, she also asked if I was still taking them in the week or if I was going to cancel again.\n\nAITA for asking to rearrange a weekend with my girls so that I could look after my fianc\u00e9e?\n\nEdit: I don't have any family who could take the girls. My sister lives the other side of the world. The only family Aya has is her aunt who does the school drop off and pick up for us but isn't available on the weekend.", "created_utc": 1678756093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qs519/aita_for_asking_my_ex_to_rearrange_a_weekend_with/", "score": 612, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He never came to pick us up.\"\n\nAsking was ok, **not showing up to pick up your children when it was your responsibility is *not*.**\n\nYou don't get to just flake on parenting because you suddenly have other more important priorities. Your kids are old enough now to remember your new wife is now more important than they are. \n\nShe's probably going to get full custody and then you can arrange to see them whenever you don't have anything else going on.", "Yes, YTA. Your children are in fact *your* children. They\u2019re not Aya\u2019s children who you babysit occasionally when it\u2019s convenient for you. You don\u2019t get to pick and choose your obligations to them. \n\nIt\u2019s great you wanted to protect Faith\u2019s mental health, but you cannot do it at the expense of your kids or just expect Aya to pick up the slack. You needed to make an arrangement for Faith to stay elsewhere or for you to take the kids elsewhere if you felt she couldn\u2019t be around them. You don\u2019t get to just not show up after being explicitly told Aya couldn\u2019t rearrange. \n\nAnd if you spent the weekend making the kids feel like a burden or like they did something wrong just by being there, then you really, really suck.", "YTA I was actively miscarrying while hosting my 3 year old\u2019s birthday party and taking care of my 1 year old. As a parent, you can\u2019t take weekends off just because something horrible happens to you.", "YTA You had already rescheduled this weekend once and you knew your ex had plans. Your fianc\u00e9e's miscarriage is tough, of course, and I understand why you wanted to make her weekend easier but that can't be at the expense of your kids. They deserve to be able to count on seeing their father regularly, even in the tough times. \n\nAsking was fine, not taking \"no\" for an answer and not picking up your kids at the agreed-on time makes you a huge AH.", "Aya may be your children's other parent, but she isn't your obligatory back-up plan. Yes, it's absolutely horrendous that Faith is going through a miscarriage, my heart breaks for her and I'm sure she genuinely wasn't in a place to be around your kids. But *you* still have a parental obligation to your kids. That doesn't go away, no matter what else is going on in your life.\n\nAnd simply refusing to come get the kids because Aya said no? That's a really gross powerplay and it's unacceptable. You don't get to control Aya like that. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, your kids should always come first. My parents were divorced too, and going back and forth is hard enough on them already. But then for you to just\u2026.NOT SHOW to pick them up when it was your responsibility (especially since your ex had plans to be out of town), that was super petty, immature, and YTA for letting your kids got caught in the crossfire. \n\nThey may not remember the specifics of that weekend, but they\u2019ll remember that shitty feeling of their dad not wanting them around. That sticks with you as a kid.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been through a miscarriage myself, but the world didn\u2019t just stop around me. If it was your turn to have the kiddos and your gf needed time away from any kids, she probably should have just gone to her parents or a friends house to be alone to begin with. \n\nI will admit though that your ex having called you out for not making it a \u201cfun\u201d weekend\u2026that\u2019s not cool bc of course it\u2019s not fun - you\u2019re grieving. It was a little insensitive of her to expect that it would just going to be a regular ole\u2019 weekend full of sunshine and rainbows when a literal piece of you just died. \n\nI get that you wanted to be there to support your gf through this difficult time, and I can respect that - but you can\u2019t just put her wellbeing above everything else when you already have two kids who need your love, time, and attention. Parenthood isn\u2019t something you can just rearrange and reschedule. It\u2019s a full time gig. 24/7. 365 days a year.", "I\u2019m sorry man but YTA. You cannot keep rearranging on your kids, and the fact you didn\u2019t even show up until you got threatened, that a major AH move", "YTA. You barely see your kids and trying to prioritize your new fianc\u00e9 over them. What a horrible, shitty father you are. Do better, or your girls will grow up and never speak to you again. Or maybe you don\u2019t care about that.", "YTA. \n\nYou had other options and chose not to pursue any of them including asking a family member or friend to babysit on your parenting time, taking the girls to a hotel for the weekend, or even keeping the girls at your exes home with you (if she would be okay with that) and you CHOSE to call last minute and assumed your ex was able to keep the kids. She wasn't. She made that clear. You offered her the time and she said she had plans. After that it becomes your responsibility to make alternative arrangements.", "YTA.  While the miscarriage is sad, you don't get to stop being a parent. When you were married to Aya and she had her miscarriage, as you mentioned.  Did you drop the kids off somewhere else for a few weeks? No, you cannot treat children like that, like burdens or luggage.  They are there for good, bad and otherwise.  Holy cow, you are their dad.  Act like it.", "YTA\n\nI have a question for you: did you already have children when your ex-wife had her miscarriage(s)? If so, did you ship them off to another family member to protect your wife\u2019s fragile sensibilities? If the answer is no, then you are the problem. Tbh, all I got from your tale of woe is that your fianc\u00e9 is more important to you than your own children. But, more worrying, that your fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t be able to cope having them around if she\u2019s unable to have her own. What will you do then? Become a deadbeat dad? You\u2019re partway there already.\n\nTo be clear: parenthood isn\u2019t only a weekend, sunny day, fun dad kind of deal. It\u2019s 24/7/365, even if you\u2019re not the custodial parent and even when you or your SO are sick. Your children must always be YOUR TOP PRIORITY, no matter what or who. If you don\u2019t understand that, then you deserve everything that your ex-wife dishes out.", "YTA\nThey are your kids. It\u2019s your weekend. It\u2019s your responsibility to take care of them. You were already told no as she rightfully made plans for her weekend without the kids. You don\u2019t get to decide when it\u2019s convenient for you to parent.", "YTA\n\nIt was fine to ask, but the answer was no.\nNot picking up your children as per the schedule makes you the AH and may put your custody arrangement in jeopardy.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to pick and choose when you want to parent.  This was your time and your responsibility to figure it out.", "YTA-you didn\u2019t have a good enough reason. Your responsibility is to your kids first, especially when Faith isn\u2019t your wife. There wasn\u2019t an emergency EITHER time you rearranged the weekend and you are clearly sending a message to your kids that they aren\u2019t important.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t a babysitter. You are a parent. You already get the vast majority of the days off from being a hands on parent. While I truly sympathize with your fianc\u00e9es feelings, you have children. That means being with you is accepting their presence rain or shine, good times or bad, tired or rested etc. \n\nYou seriously just didn\u2019t show up for your kids? What kind of father does that?", "Wow.  Imagine if you were still with your ex and she had been the one having the miscarriage.  That would have been tough, having to both care for her and your children.\n\nGood thing you broke up and can dump your kids on her!  (sarcasm)\n\nYou don't get to dump your kids on your ex because the timing is inconvenient.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Please do not let this be a hard lesson down the line. You\u2019re a father before a husband. That\u2019s your responsibility no matter what.", "YTA\n\nNot for asking, but for not taking no for an answer.\n\nTheir mom had plans. Period. It doesn\u2019t matter what her plans were, you were the designated caregiver for that weekend. You don\u2019t get to blow off your kids and not be their dad just because you want to. She said no. If you don\u2019t want them at home, it\u2019s YOUR responsibility to find other alternatives for them, ESPECIALLY last minute. You could have taken the girls somewhere else if Faith wasn\u2019t able to be around them.\n\nMiscarriages suck. Sometimes it takes years to properly grieve. You can\u2019t just blow your kids off until you are both ready to \u201chave them around.\u201d", "YTA I\u2019m sorry for Faith losing a pregnancy. That doesn\u2019t absolve you of your parental responsibilities. You still have to take care of your children \ud83d\uded1", "Info: why is your custody so minimal and have you ever taken the girls for extra time as a favor to Aya?", "YTA\nYou do remember you\u2019re a father with responsibilities, right? And those are your children?", "YTA\n\nThey're your children there's no switch where you can turn it on or off for being a parent\n\nYour ex already does the bulk of parenting you asked she refused it was your duty to pick up your daughter's \n\nYou're a parent act like it", "YTA. You have your daughters MUCH less than your wife, and you are still neglecting your responsibility as a parent. It is unacceptable. People with children miscarry and they still have to be parents to their children. You asked your wife to watch them, she declined. It was your responsibility to balance your patenting obligations with Faith's needs and you failed. This is not to diminish Faith's real pain; but deciding you are temporarily not a parent because of it is not reasonable or acceptable. Frankly your wife should seek full custody if you think it is.", "YTA\n\nVery sorry to hear about Faith's miscarriage. That is an awful experience and you're not wrong about not wanting the kids around during such a difficult time.\n\nHowever, your ex is not required to be the solution to your problem. Maybe you could have asked family to take the girls for the weekend? Or taken them somewhere yourself? You were not wrong to make the request to your ex to switch, but if the answer is no, you move on and look for another solution.", "YTA. Parenthood is constant. There is no break from it. Step-parenthood is also constant and if your partner can\u2019t handle that then she shouldn\u2019t be with someone who has kids. You suck for putting your partner before your kids", "YTA. Dude, they are your kids.  Figure it out.  Your ex had made plans and you agreed to pick them up. Not showing is a huge AH move.  It was probably really disappointing to your kids as well.  Looking after your fiancee doesn't mean that you abdicate your parental responsibilities.", "YTA no holds bar YTA. I have had 2 miscarriages. Once when I was at work on a ship in the middle of the ocean. Fortunately I survived, the second was when I was pregnant with twins and only one survived and the second had to be removed. They would have been identical and every time I see my daughter\u2019s beautiful face I know that her mirror is missing and my heart was breaking. But my daughter never, ever paid the price for that. I never once made her feel like she was not enough or that it was some how her fault. I went out of my fucking way to make sure she knew how much I love her and that even though she is my one and only I have absolutely no regrets. Yes I miss my Angel and wish she would have been able to enjoy a life with us but my daughter, my very much loved and alive daughter is my first priority. Your excuses are thin and it sounds like you backseat parent as it is so do better. Take care of your wife but jesus your kids, who barely get any time with you as it is are your first priority.", "YTA. You're allowed to ask and she's allowed to say no.  You have a custody agreement for a reason, and she already agreed to let you switch it once. She had plans. She's not obligated to take your time because there are tough emotions in your house. What would you do if you had full custody of your girls and this happened? Because that's how you should always approach these situations. You never know when it's going to be inconvenient to be a parent.", "YTA. Your daughters might not remember you refusing to pick them up, but they\u2019ll remember how it made them feel. This whole situation stinks.", "Yta and need to put your KIDS first", "Soft YTA because you barely see your kids as it is and have zero qualms just dumping them on their mom without using your own peabrain to be a parent and make your own alternative arrangements.", "First- I'm sorry for your loss\n\nYTA where were the girls when you were dealing with miscarriages with your 1st wife? You obviously couldn't just send them off to someone else then. As a parent, we don't get the luxury of picking when we have our kids with us. I was a single parent and there was no other parent - my kid was with me through the good and bad. I know you're trying to do right by your fianc\u00e9e, but your kids are your responsibility.", "YTA, easily.\n\n\nAt first, I could sympathize a bit with your plight, but as you continued to drone on you just mad everything look worse for yourself. What happened to faith is traumatic and eventful, and she does deserve care, and depending on the situation, you're ex would've been the TA for refusing to rearrange.\n\nNot in this case, though. You already rearranged your week once, and want to do so again without real notice, and force you're ex and their partner to cancel plans that they were looking towards due to the overwhelming work that your ex is doing, from emergency care to child care, leaving no breaks in between, and you want to take the small break that she has away? That's real shitty. \n\nAnd that's before even touchig upon the fact that you childishly and rudely decided to not show up without notice, acting like a brat, and no doubt making a memory that your daughters will remember, of their father trying to ditch them and only bitterly picking them up after being threatened. I have sympathy towards Faith, but her situation doesn't mean that you can just throw everything to your ex.", "YTA.\n\nThat was YOUR weekend to parent.  YOU should have come up with a better Plan B.", "YTA.  It wasn't your ex-wife's job to accommodate you.  And just not showing up when your kids are expecting you just ups the AH rating.", "YTA. Your contact with your daughters is little as it is. I presume you meant to do well by your new fianc\u00e9e but you blinded yourself to how horrifying it is to have a co-parent you can't depend on or a dad who's willing to just - not show up for you -.", "YTA. \n\nYour kids are still your kids and your responsibility, even when your fianc\u00e9e is having a hard time. That's part of parenting. I lost 2 in a row when we were trying for our 3rd child. I completely understand the difficulty of the situation for your fianc\u00e9e. But YOU don't get a pass. \n\nThat was an extremely shitty thing you did to your daughters too, BTW. You didn't just \"burden\" your ex by trying to leave them there while you knew she had plans (because you were meant to have your children).  You literally left your kids sitting there waiting for you and didn't show up until their mom called and MADE you show up. You owe those girls a huge apology.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry Faith dealt with the loss. It's an awful thing to live through. \n\nBut you are responsible for your kids. You had an arrangement, work caused a reschedule. Kids exist in good times and bad.", "Poor kids.", "Did you ever consider taking them to a waterpark hotel for the wknd, or booking spa for gf? Just ghosting was a AH move.", "I'm really sorry about the situation but YTA, they are your kids. It's amazing that you're looking out for your fiancee's mental health but I still fail to understand why you couldn't take your kids. It's confusing, imagine you had full custody and this happened they would around wouldn't they? You would have had to find a way to make the situation work which I feel is what you should have done in this case after finding out your ex-wife can't swap weekends. Plus you literally didn't show up for your children by not going to pick them up.", "Your first commitment is to your children.", "If your daughters were at your home when the miscarriage happened, would you have thrown them out into the street to appease your girlfriend? YTA. You\u2019re the worst.", "YTA \n\nyou have to think about your children first of all. I hope she gets custody so you can have the weekends all to yourself and not let them be alone.", "YTA and you\u2019re damn stupid. Your first obligation is to your children. Your fianc\u00e9e falls somewhere after that. She couldn\u2019t handle it? Okay. Put her up in a nice hotel for the night and do your job as a parent. You only have your kids 25% of the time and that\u2019s too much for you to handle so your ex-wife always has to be in charge.", "YTA as basically every commenter has said. You have your kids 8/30 days a month and already rearranged 2/8 days or 25% of your parenting time, then just didn\u2019t show up when you were told no that your ex - who not only has them 22/30 days but ALREADY rearranged for you before - could not accommodate you again.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter why. No is a full sentence and your fianc\u00e9es mental health is not more important than your responsibility to the children you already have. \n\nI\u2019d advise you to stop trying to have more children when you can\u2019t even parent the two you have now. I also find it highly doubtful that this is the first instance you have tried to railroad your ex. People don\u2019t go to the nuclear option of threatening lawyers over a \u201cone time\u201d situation. \n\nDo better. You\u2019re not the center of the universe.", "ESH - Aya told you no, not possible, so you had the chance to make alternative arrangements (keeping the kids out of the house for the weekend for example).\n\nA miscarriage is awful, I had 2, but sadly life goes on and you can't neglect the living to mourn the dead, particularly when they are young kids that don't understand.\n\nAya's message was uncalled for - she could have prepared the kids, or at the least been sympathetic when their weekend wasn't their 'normal, fun weekend'. Snarky comments are definitely not needed.", "YTA, you barely see the kids as it is.", "YTA.  \n\nYou are not the asshole for asking, but you are the asshole for what you actually did.   \n It was understandable to ask if your ex could keep the girls for the weekend, but it was wrong to not accept her answer, and simply not show up for them when they were expecting you.  They are old enough to be hurt and confused by that.  \n\nSince Faith couldn't be around the kids, it was up to you to find a solution.  You could have taken the girls away to a hotel for a dad-daughters mini vacation.  You could have asked a friend to babysit.  You needed to come up with the solution, since it was your custody time.  \n\nThe bottom line:  It is not okay to make your children feel unwanted.", "Yta- im so incredibly sorry for your loss but dude you're a dad and you're going to have to learm to balance your fiancees needs with your childrens.", "YTA, Should have booked your fiance a little spa weekend with her friend that she ended up staying with and doing something fun with the girls", "Can we just say both parties seem like pretty bad people and call it good?", "YTA, not for asking but for not accepting the answer she gave you.", "YTA.\n\nAlthough I think this is a soft TA situation. I do sympathize with what your fiance is going through. I'm going to assume you waited until the last minute to discuss with your ex-wife because you believed that Faith might have recuperated enough by the weekend to be able to handle having your kids over. That said, regardless of how your fiance is, your kids do need to come first and at some level you should have planned a contingency for how you were going to care for your kids. Also, based on your post, your ex needed a break as well and I can't fault her for being a bit exasperated.", "My parents were divorced and my dad had full custody of us kids. I remember when I was 8 and my brother was 11 my mom was supposed to pick us up for a visit. She never showed. I still remember to this day. And it seriously screwed with my poor brother. YTA.", "YTA, you are still responsible for your children regardless of what is going on in your life. Did you send the girls away when your ex had a miscarriage?!?!

There are too many risks.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA I understand what  you and your fianc\u00e9 are going through a lot but they are your kids and you don\u2019t get to just flake on them for the weekends you have them. \n\nYour ex does a majority of childcare, likely when she\u2019s sick or going through tough things because that\u2019s what parents do. \n\nI haven\u2019t had a miscarriage so I can\u2019t speak to that (but it seems other mothers in the comments have) but I found my mother dead in her home, and I went back to my house that evening and parented my kid. I was sick as a dog and in severe pain with gallstones, literally waiting for a room at the hospital and my son was with me (my husband was on his way from work) but while I was the parent in charge I cared for my kid despite my discomfort. Your kids should always come first. \n\nSure parents deserve breaks but you get plenty of time without them and you are bailing on the time you do have. I understand what you are both going through it really hard but you don\u2019t get to tap out of being a parent because of it. \n\nI\u2019m sure to some degree after changing once and having you ask again has led your ex to wonder how more times? How long until your fianc\u00e9 is in a headspace to have your kids around? If the kids aren\u2019t your top priority on the few times you have them then why shouldn\u2019t she ask for full custody?

You already put you first before your children and then you decided to put your girlfriend first. Your ex already made one switch for you. Then you tried to call on short notice to make another switch.

We have 2 daughters together (6F & 5F). We have been divorced for 4 years. Our custody arrangement is that I have them every other weekend and one night during the week. The one night varies every week depending out our schedules as we both work in a hospital.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e, Faith (42F), had a miscarriage last week. The miscarriage has been difficult on both of us, but Faith has really struggled. Sadly, it is something I have been through several times with Aya. I was due to have the girls at the weekend from Friday to Sunday. However Thursday night it was clear that Faith wasn't in the right head space mentally to have the girls around. I called Aya to rearrange with her, so I could have them next weekend.\n\nAya was annoyed when I called her to rearrange. We had rearranged my weekend once already as I was called into work due to it being short staffed. This was meant to be my rearranged weekend. She had plans already for the weekend, she and her boyfriend, (Sam 46M) had booked a weekend away. He'd booked a weekend away for them due to her being so run down from work, she works in an emergency department. Between that and having our girls, that doesn't leave her much time to do anything for herself. She told me that I needed to take them because she was going away. I told her that I was really sorry but that I didn't think it was a good environment for the girls to be around Faith while she is coming to terms with the miscarriage, but that it also wasn't good for Faith to have them around. Aya told me that she wasn't cancelling her plans for me and that she needed to put herself first for once. \n\nOn Friday, I didn't pick the girls up as normal. When Aya called to find out where I was, I told her that to protect Faith's mental health, we couldn't have the girls. Aya told me that if I wasn't at her's in the next 30 minutes then she was going to see her lawyer first thing on Monday to go for full custody. This is the second time since we have split that I have asked her to rearrange a weekend. I did pick up the girls in the end but Faith really struggled having them at ours and come Saturday afternoon, she went to stay at a friend's because she found it overwhelming. Aya messaged me this morning saying the girls had been upset that the weekend didn't feel like a normal fun weekend at mine, she also asked if I was still taking them in the week or if I was going to cancel again.\n\nAITA for asking to rearrange a weekend with my girls so that I could look after my fianc\u00e9e?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA", "YTA dude.", "YTA those are your kids not an option on whether or not your fianc\u00e9 GF whatever she is feels well they are your kids your priority not an option.", "YTA, why couldn\u2019t she just go to her friend\u2019s house for the weekend in the first place? Is she more important than your children? Sure sounds like you\u2019ve set them aside in order to care for your adult partner. Miscarriage is hard but having a father who cares more about his 2nd wife than his kids hurts too.", "Yta. Yes this is a sad situation absolutely BUT YOUR KIDS AREN'T A HOBBY YOU CAN PICK UP WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE. Its also not Aya's job to give YOU a break. If YOU wanted the kids elsewhere on YOUR custody time, then YOU should have made the arrangements, like an adult.  And simply not showing up doesn't qualify as that. \nDid you really have to ask if YTA???.", "YTA. One job that doesn\u2019t stop despite what else is going on is parenting.", "Also i get you dont have family around but do you not have...friends?\nPlus you had plenty of options like you entertaining them while fiance did what she needed. \nAt their ages they cant be THAT much work either. They can feed and dress themselves, they know not to drink drano, etc.  Come on dude. You owe them and aya an apology", "YTA you can\u2019t choose to be there for your kids only when it\u2019s convenient. Your ex was courteous enough to rearrange her plans for you the previous week and now you need her to do it again. Parenting is a responsibility, not an option.", "YTA What\u2019s going to be your excuse next weekend?", "YTA. Your weekend, your problem. You find alternate arrangements if you have to that are not simply staying with primary caregiver. \n\nYou don\u2019t stop being a father because your wife is going through it.", "YTA...I'm sorry your wife had that experience, but you are the father to two young children. You already only see them  8 days a month. I can't imagine an arrangement like that with my own children.  I wouldn't even want to miss half the month. Terrible things happen sometimes and unless the emergency was your wife's life was in danger and she was in the hospital, you don't opt to keep your children away. Sorry, I think your wife needs to have some understanding of that as well. Those kids are part of her family too now.", "YTA. Your ex could not rearrange her weekend. The girls were your responsibility. YOU needed to find a sitter or ship your fiancee off to a friend or parent's house. This wasn't your ex's problem to solve. Total failure on your part.", "YTA. \n\nI hope they\u2019re young enough to \u201cforget\u201d you chose not to pick them up. I\u2019m 33. 12 year old me was yesterday when my mom didn\u2019t pick me up for Easter to spite my dad. I\u2019m STILL wondering what I did wrong, nearly 21 years later.", "YTA. Man up. They're your kids and you can't expect your ex to continually change weekends. She's entitled to her plans.\n\nYou have to learn to deal with kids and emergencies\n\n\nI'm sorry about Faith's miscarriage but wonder if your inability to or disinterest in parenting your children is why you're split from their mother.\n\nOr is the problem they're not Faith's kids and she resents then being around?", "I am sorry for the struggle your Fiancee' is dealing with and I give you props for wanting to support her emotionally but if she is to be their stepmother, she has to be OK with them being around. Your kids will fill slighted and your ex has a very valid case to get sole custody. She rearranged the weekend due to your work , and then she made plans. While your circumstances are out of your control, as a parent you need to be there for your kids and do your best to keep their visits as normal as possible.", "Bookings cost money OP and reservations are generally not refundable.  Were you prepared to reimburse your ex for these losses?", "YTA\n\nYou are treating the children you have as optional. No one wants to be in a situation where they have to put off grieving and comforting their partner, but unfortunately it does happen. \n\nAlso you should probably re-evaluate your idea of what your relationship with Aya is now, because apparently there is a big disconnect in that you are seeing her as someone you can rely on and be supported by, or just bulldozer to get your way, and she has told you she does not want this.", "YTA.  Perhaps send the GF to a hotel if she cannot stand to be around your children at this time.  I'm very sorry for the loss, but your children have nothing to do with them.  Would their empathy not be welcome?", "Pretty disingenuous title and question- it\u2019s not the asking that makes you the AH- it\u2019s the attempt at a no show to force your ex to comply that makes YTA.", "Major YTA. You sound like my ex husband. I've taken care of our kids myself while going through a mastectomy and reconstruction. My Ex disappeared off the face of the planet. He just stopped showing up. I have kids the same age as yours. Want a glimpse into your future? My kids don't even remember their Dad. I was also awarded sole custody. Life doesn't stop because of a tragedy. Also hate to be cruel but a baby at 42? Really? She was high risk from the start. Im sure her OB warned you this was possible due to it being a geriatric pregnancy. You can't even take care of the kids you have. Take it as a sign that you need to be a better parent to the kids that are living and only seeing their Dad 10 days a month. Irresponsible.", "YTA- your job as a parent does not stop because of something terrible happening. You asked and she said no she has plans. She has the majority of the parenting roll and works long hours too. \nYour fianc\u00e9 has to understand that your daughters are as much your responsibility as their moms.", "YTA it was fine to ask but once she said no you were a compete AH to not pick up the girls", "YTA sorry. The situation is unfortunate, but you asked and she refused which she was within her rights to do., and you need to respect that! These are your kids and need to be your priority and honestly, you can\u2019t do much for Faith except give her space to grieve.", "YTA your children are not accessories to be taken lightly. They are your children. You have a responsibility to them, first and foremost. Your ex should not have to scramble to accomodate you when she already has, and has plans for her time. You were going to be home and available, you can do the work to shield your current gf. Sure, some degree of flexibility is nice, which you are getting, but you're pushing the limit. Fuck around some more. Try it. Don't be surprised when you find out. Not showing up was such an asshole thing to do. You're lucky your ex doesn't file on you. You should apologise, and do not do that again.", "YTA....your current children are more important than your future family. You didn't turn up when you were supposed to: that would have been upsetting to your kids who didn't ask for separated parents. It's not your ex's job to accommodate your current fiance if she chooses not to. If your fiance can't  accept being second to your current children then you both have a problem .", "NTA - Co-parenting requires flexibility, your ex doesn't seem to realise this.\n\nLegal threats are not on - get yourself representation fast.", "YTA\n\nDude. That's not how parenting works. You can't nope out of responsibilities because you're not in the right headspace. \n\nThat goes for Faith, too. She married you, thus agreeing to your responsibilities as a parent. AND she's obviously trying to be a mom herself! What do you plan to do if Faith is in a bad headspace when you have more children with her?\n\nJeez, I swear I'll never understand how some people just don't realize how much sacrifice having kids is yet have kids anyway.", "Exactly, he has his kids every other weekend, and one night during the week. Ex already does majority of the child care, and he still expects for her to drop everything. I understand this is different circumstances, but he asked and she said no! Only reason he actually picked up his daughters, was after she threatened to go for full custody.", "YTA. Your ex already accommodated you once\u2026 and now you pull this shit of not showing up, without telling her, after she already told you she was going away? You are putting your needs in front of hers, when she has already shown to be a willing partner in raising your girls.\n\nI am sorry your fianc\u00e9e isn\u2019t feeling well and she needs to recover. But your children should be your first priority - that\u2019s what you sign-up for when you become a dad.\n\nDefinitely making a case for Father of the Year /s", "This is the hardest answer. But the realest. My daughters bday is the day after mine. I was in my second trimester and while I knew he was no longer in my body I was still cramping and bleeding heavily during my daughter\u2019s 3rd bday party which happens to be my actual bday. It sucks. But our living children (step or otherwise) take precedent. \n\nOP - I am sorry for your loss. Truly. But your children need you. And as horrible as your fianc\u00e9 was feeling physically and emotionally it doesn\u2019t remove the needs of your other kids. Don\u2019t forget them in the process.", "That sounds horrible, I\u2019m sorry you went through that. You sound like a great mom \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "This happened to me last month. My two oldest have birthdays 1 day apart and I share a birthday with one of them. Actively miscarrying through a weekend of back to back birthdays.

I fully relate to his fianc\u00e9s struggle as I\u2019ve now had 3 losses, but it\u2019s wrong for her to put him in the place to chose between her and his children and even worse for him to not choose them.", "I'm sorry.  I was also miscarrying while hosting our oldest's first birthday party.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through that.

It sucked so much, but I threw myself into appreciating every tiny thing about them.", "He can start missing weekends then she gets full custody, then when they are old enough, they won't have time for him. My young adult kids maybe see their dad once a year now. One refuses to see him at all.", "Everything about this. Parents putting their new partners over their kids is something that sticks with them for life - they may not remember the specifics, but they\u2019ll remember the feeling of abandonment. \n\nAya already takes the majority of the childcare as a (I presume?) single mom. It\u2019s a crappy situation all around, and I feel for OP and Faith\u2019s pain, but you cannot flake on your kids. A miscarriage is painful and emotionally devastating, but plenty of parents go through them while continuing to care for the kids they already have. If Faith couldn\u2019t take being around OP\u2019s kids while mourning the loss of her own (at 42, it\u2019s obviously very hard to get pregnant and she also be feeling like she\u2019s lost her last chance or something along those lines) then she needed to do in the first instance what she ended up doing. Go somewhere else for the weekend, while dad explained to his girls that he was a bit sad but he\u2019s happy to have them over.\n\nAlso if she takes you to/back to court, flaking on preagreed custody will not reflect well on your case.

Kids know when adults are in a mood. If he was already late picking them up and only went after legal action was threatened, I don\u2019t imagine that car ride was fun, likely very tense. \n\nOP had the chance to plan how to manage the weekend. Maybe he could have arranged a playdate with their friends to give faith some quiet time with him. Let the girls know that faith wasn\u2019t feeling well, so they had to be respectful.

Tbh I\u2019d be shocked if OP did little more than dump them in front of a television and tell them to be quiet.", "I wish he would answer the it about if they can\u2019t have their own child.

I'm over 6 months pregnant, if I lost my baby today, my toddler is still gonna need me tomorrow. Do better.", "I think you need to put your prioties straight.

If not possible, then yes, her staying with a friend at her place was a good option. Your ex needed her time too by the sound of it. Hey, you made an error in judgement under a very stressful time.

Some people never recover from their first miscarriage, what if she\u2019s never \u201cin the right space\u201d to be around your kids?

They are too young to understand the situation and why your home wasn't happy this weekend and I'm sorry for that, but honestly there was no need. \n\nIt was also clearly not best for the kids to be waiting for you to come get them and for you to just abandon your responsibility to them. They will remember this and you have some serious groveling to do both to them and to your ex on this one.\n\nYou both need to do better. Both of your schedules are going to need to flex a hundred more times before those girls are 18 for one reason or another.

That's shameful.", "Ad much as I will get hate for this, I kinda think ESH (except the fiance)  but only slightly in his case. Something about the way full custody was thrown up immediately is kinda sus. Everyone is so quick to judge the non custodial when technically that's a joint custody agreement by most states and to get anymore time can be hard. Also he mentioned that they both work in the same hospital. Wich means they both work really long hours. Everyone says she does more \"parenting\" but she wanted her break.she chose herself over her kids to and yal are supporting her. She sent her kids to the home of a grieving couple so she could party. That's not good parenting either.  overall yal he was dealing with the loss of a child himself and he had the foresight to say hey this might not be a good idea. Death in any form should be handled with care. Ironically he had taken care of his ex in that situation to but he isnt allowed to do the same to a new partner. If all of this was reversed and she needed for some reason to not have the kids yal would be not the aholing like crazy but bc it was a guy he was \"bad father and lazy parent \".

My ex and I work around each other\u2019s schedule,if something comes up and the other doesn\u2019t have plans then we definitely will switch our time, but if something comes up during our scheduled time and the other already has plans then it\u2019s on the parent who is scheduled to find childcare. Your ex has plans. It\u2019s now on you to figure it out. She doesn\u2019t need to rearrange her plans to accommodate you and your fianc\u00e9. If she did\u2026 that opens a huge can of worms. Ask me how I know??? The mother of your children only gets to make plans every other weekend (im not even going to count one night a week you have them). So, she finally makes plans and you want a free babysitter during the time you are suppose to have them and expect her to drop everything to accommodate you?  I\u2019m not surprise she wont. I\u2019m guessing she accommodated your needs over hers for most of your marriage. She\u2019s had enough!  Projecting much? F**k yes I am.

Why are you special?", "YTA, while I get your finance was dealing with a lot emotionally your children come first\u2026 you could have booked her a hotel and spa weekend so she could work through some things but trying to reschedule Thursday when you pick them up the next day is highly inconsiderate.", "Holy crap YTA.

I get it, miscarriage is horrible, and you both absolutely deserve sympathy for what you are going through. You do not, however, deserve to simply abandon parental responsibilities because things are rough. You said your ex also miscarried. Was this after you had a successful pregnancy? Would you have farmed your kid(s) off to someone else if she had? There is no difference just because it is your fianc\u00e9e who had the miscarriage. Your daughters are still your responsibility.", "YTA\n\nYou are father first. You don't get to decide when not to be a father. If your fiancee needs to be away, book a hotel away for her or take the girls there for the weekend. You have them only 6 days a month. Stop forgoing your parenting time and find a solution. Faith needs to learn to deal with her miscarriage in a healthy manner that doesn't impose on your position as a father. If that means she goes out for a weekend with the gals, then make it f***ing happen. \nBut not utilizing your parenting time and imposing on your ex-wife's freetime is absolutely unacceptable. Your ex already does the majority of the childcare, so of course shes gonna threaten full custody - and she would absolutelywin since youve been forgoing your court designated time... you see, she doesn't even need to offer makeup time either.  It is your job to either accept your parenting time or to not.  \n\nHopefully your ex will refrain from rescheduling anymore with you so you will actually value what little time you have with them. My dad would have killed for the extra weekday you get or the ex wife who is actually super accommodating up to this point.  My mother was far less gracious and kind,  and psycho to boot. You are quite lucky to have such a reasonable coparent, and you are taking advantage of her.  \n\nStop putting off your 1st priorities - your kids. Your living breathing feeling kids. Life doesn't stop when things like this happen. So stop being a shit father and pick them up and use your parenting time.

Are you shipping that kid off somewhere, too?? Did Anya got to not be a mother when she was going through her miscarriages??", "That's a slippery slope, OP.

Your fianc\u00e9e should have made plans to be with friends if she couldn\u2019t handle seeing children - your priority is your kids. If she\u2019s going to be a step-mom, the kids should be *her* priority too. Do you think parents get to magically have no kids when their loved ones die, or other horrible tragedies happen?

Whilst I think it was on OP to tell his kids (age appropriate), that his fianc\u00e9e isn\u2019t feeling well, which is why the weekend needs to be a little calmer this time, Aya apparently also went through miscarriage(s?) before and this kind of kicking someone when they\u2019re down and expecting a whole \u201cfun weekend\u201c in this situation is also kinda uncalled for.

Absolutely disgusting behaviour!", "YTA! You are their dad not some part time babysitter who can turn up when it suits you.

You had already rescheduled your scheduled weekend due to work, to not show up twice is just not acceptable when your living babies are still so young. \n\nYou should have arranged for your partner to be elsewhere if she was struggling, you could have asked her if she would like a spa retreat weekend away with some pampering, or time with her family, but that you do have children you cannot opt out of. \n\nYour emergency is not your ex wife\u2019s problem. It\u2019s 100% your responsibility to make alternative arrangements if you need to reschedule. You\u2019ve been blessed to have the support of your ex wife in that regard.

People say your kids are your priority. Sure but it doesn\u2019t mean like your fianc\u00e9 is a nobody. This wasn\u2019t because you two wanted to go and have fun but because of a miscarriage which is a tragedy. It is great that you care for her. As well as for your kids because it was obviously a bad weekend for them considering the state of mind you were in. This wasn\u2019t only Faith\u2019s miscarriage but yours as well. As your malicious ex says the weekend wasn\u2019t \u201cas fun as usually \u201c. Now this is a disgusting thing to say. \n\nAnd people here act as you are some horrible father because you wanted a rearrangement for the second time in 4 years! Both for valid reasons. Again your ex is an AH for threatening with taking away custody over this. Don\u2019t let the awful people here make you feel bad. You are the one whose request for rearranging was for the best of several people unlike her ex who didn\u2019t want to come forward to you who was thinking only about herself. You and Faith should have been given time to grieve and then when being mentally well again you would be able to give the girls all the fun weekends they deserve.\n\nAnd I saw sone people actually shaming Faith for getting pregnant in her age. Now they are especially gross. I wish you and Faith all the best and hope you will end up having a baby. And don\u2019t let the threats of your ex who is the only major AH in this story get to you. She got nothing against you. 2 rearrangements in 4 years is not going to be a good reason for it.", "YTA. Not for asking, but for not accepting no as an answer. Rearranging was not possible for your ex, so it\u2019s then your responsibility to find another solution.

The fact you thought it was ok to ditch your kids because Faith thinks your parenting is a conditional thing means you've either given her the idea that is so, or Faith brings out the worst in you.

She should have left before they ever got there.  \n\n\nYou really messed up.", "YTA\n\nYou have to coexist with your fianc\u00e9 and kids.

I\u2019m also fully aware Faith would understand you can\u2019t conveniently leave kids elsewhere, and had a friend to be with all along. \n\n**The real issue is YOU THINK YOU CAN deprioritise kids.** It doesn\u2019t work like that. Your ex would be right to get full custody because your mindset is just wrong.\n\nIs your ex being unforgiving? Idk given she told you THIS TIME she cannot AND you abandoned your kids?!

Nope, I always had the door open, offered to bring my kid, never asked for child support even etc. - I just didn\u2019t trust someone who was still acting like I\u2019m the priority, trying to win me over - when there\u2019s a kid on the way/alive. There\u2019s a mindset you cannot change as a mother, many women fail to see it. For me it was anyone who thinks kids are a to do list item you de/prioritise. Even if it\u2019s done \u2018for me\u2019, it\u2019s an excuse - cause kids are kids. I was raised by a single father, guess it made it easy to see when a guy isn\u2019t really in it. Maybe I\u2019m over reading into it\u2026your mindset just really bothers me - kids are not optional or part time. Ever. You don\u2019t take them around your schedules. That\u2019s not what Aya is doing - you frame it like it is to ease your conscience. But she has them all the time you don\u2019t - and arranges everything for them, where you fork it off to her. I just can\u2019t and don\u2019t get why either woman would want that.

You have children, who are there, who exist, who want to see you- and you're too busy for them because your (not actually wife yet) was sad.\n\nAnd not only did you not see them, you actively went out of your way to just now show up until you were threatened with legal action.\n\nIt took the threat of legal action for you to see your children.

I sincerely think you should not have more children.\n\nStep up and be a dad.  You don't get to not be a dad because it's emotionally hard sometimes.  If youre sad, if youre sick, if you're going through a trauma- sorry, but you still have to be a dad.

Depending on how early it is, it literally could just be an implantation error.

It\u2019s really sad what your fianc\u00e9 and you are going through but you\u2019re still a parent. Your ex has the children most of the time, you have to parent sometime in the month.  Sometimes life is not easy on any of us. Your fianc\u00e9 needs some therapy, I know it\u2019s reddit and therapy is almost the answer for everything, however your children will not disappear and she will have to cope to be around them as per your custody agreement. How is she going to deal with having them around each time you have them?", "So the ex-wife isn't allowed to look after her mental health, even when she clearly communicated that she really needed that?\n\nOP's parenting responsibilities don't suddenly vanish when something else comes up. I can understand not wanting them around the fianc\u00e9e and it's fine that he asked to reschedule. But when ex-wife said no it was his responsibility to find another solution.\n\nHe could have asked the grandparents to babysit, he could have proposed that the fianc\u00e9e stays with a friend from the beginning... Anything other than simply not showing up! Which not only makes him TA to the ex-wife but also to the kids who are old enough to notice and remember shit like this.", "I'm sure the girls picked up on the fact that Daddy didn't really want them there.", "Bejesus, so many warrior women on here\ud83d\udcaa\u2764\ufe0f", "I agree with what you have said!", "My god you are sleazy.", "I dated someone who has a daughter from a previous relationship.

If they tried to call him in, it was a hard no. \u201cI have my daughter this weekend, sorry, but I am not available\u201d. He definitely could have used the additional income but time with his daughter was infinitely more valuable. \n\nWe also lost a pregnancy. He had his daughter that weekend. Of course, he and I were devastated by our loss. I NEVER would have asked him to switch weekends and lose time with his daughter. If I had, he would have said no. Not because he didn\u2019t care about my needs, but because the needs of a child will always be more important than those of an adult. It turned out that his daughter\u2019s presence that weekend was a tremendous source of comfort and joy for both of us. She helped us focus on what we have, rather than what we had lost. \n\nAs many others have stated, you are setting a dangerous precedent by choosing you and your fianc\u00e9es needs over those of your children. Relationships and marriages can end, as you know. Being a parent does not. If you continue this pattern of behavior, it\u2019s likely that seeing you and your fianc\u00e9 will no longer be important to your daughters because they will think it\u2019s not important to you. You shouldn\u2019t punish your children for a situation they didn\u2019t create. They WILL end up resenting you.", "She never asked.... Ahh, yes because the children are her responsibility. Not yours, your are just their father.\n\nBut you would in a heartbeat?

What about her busy schedule? She still manages to show up and be a mum. Especially regarding your comment on your ex's 2nd miscarriage where she still stepped up to being a Mother. \n\nUnfortunately, when you have children the world doesn't stop when terrible things happen. You don't have that luxury.

I\u2019m a musician. I have many beloved nieces and nephews (and greats!)\u2026 I\u2019d rather those be the focus on my life, but I also have to be mindful of how I participate because not being careful can mean missing out on family time and hobbies and such, or worse yet, another hospital stay. \n\nSorry for going on for so long. I guess the TL;DR is saying that someone is disabled is perfectly OK, and depending on the person, may be their preferred term. As an aside, please never call me differently abled or some other term like that. It feel infantilising and patronising. Let\u2019s just call things what they are.

That's basically how you should view your custody time if your ex has said no to adjustments.", "Ah sorry I thought that last part was sarcastic. My bad", "Well he can just off load his parental responsibilities to Faith like he did with his two kids to his ex. I\u2019m willing to bet when the kids come over, it\u2019s faith who took on the child care and mental load instead of him.

My husband & I were very upset, I was physically beat, & yet we still had to show up for our little one. She needed us so we patented as close to normal as possible until we both healed. She doesn\u2019t give us time off from being mom & dad when we have hard things happen. \n\nOP YTA, once you have children it\u2019s hard (nearly impossible) to put anyone else before your responsibility them. Given her age & the lack of mention of any children of hers I\u2019m going to guess this pregnancy felt like her last chance at traditional motherhood? That\u2019s rough. She gets to mourn that but you still have to be dad. There\u2019s no perfect solution - pick the kids up & have a quiet weekend all together at home, get a friend to stay with your fianc\u00e9 overnight while you & the girls have a sleep away at a hotel if she would prefer the space, see if your fianc\u00e9 wants to recover at the home of a friend or family member while you guys are home for the weekend but don\u2019t just shut the kids out. Don\u2019t be a flake in their eyes, don\u2019t jeopardize your coparenting relationship with their mother. \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 is going to be a partner in your life & the lives of your kids she will have to show up even when it\u2019s tough. Please explain to your ex that you were feeling a little panicked & made a huge mistake by not showing up & that it will never happen again. Then make sure it doesn\u2019t.", "So? I mean honestly- so what? Life is sometimes difficult. You don\u2019t get to not be a parent when life is hard. You suck it up like a grown up and deal. Daddy has ZERO excuses for his entitlement- there is no \u2018having a bad day can\u2019t parent\u2018 pass. And his \\*ex\\* who already shoulders the VAST majority of the parenting owes him far less than nothing. Im sorry for your loss and his but  being a fully responsible  adult is practically defined as having to keep up with your responsibilities in the face of the adversity life frequently throws at you.\n\nOP is the AH", "Yeah it's not like Aya haven't been through the same thing several times, I'm sure she can't relate /s", "He\u2019s a parent. He has other kids. His duty to them is higher than his duty to her. She\u2019s an adult. Plenty of adults have to deal with loss on their own for one weekend or find some other support for herself in the meantime, like she ultimately did when she went to stay elsewhere. He can hire a babysitter to entertain them, or he can take them himself and check in frequently by phone. \n\nHe barely has parenting time, which might be why he has forgotten the relentless nature of parenting. But parents who have had a loss or suffered great hardships still need to show up everyday for the kids. There are no breaks. If he thinks he gets a week off, then he is acting like a babysitter who gets to call out of work, not a parent. \n\nMaybe his ex would be more amenable to him canceling if she hadn\u2019t already booked a weekend away and paid all the money. But as it stands, she really needs this weekend away herself and helping him so he can take care of Faith is not her responsibility. Was he going to compensate her hundreds of dollars for all the reservations cancelled?", "All good, re-reading it, I see how you misconstrued my comment that way and apologise for the wording.\n\nI think we can both agree that OP\u2019s ex deserves a world free of AH\u2019s like OP!", "I said he is. But that was still a terrible environment to stick the kids into. An adult at severe risk who can't even look at them, and the other adult terrified for the first one so distracted and possibly not able to give the attention and supervision they need. \n\nThe fact is the mom didn't care about what was best for the kids, just that her ex take them so she could go out of town. Neither of them will get parent if the year over this situation. And you'd think she might have some sympathy since she apparently went through it herself.\n\nAnd yes I know the mom deserves a break, but none of the adults here put the kids first.", "Yeah I mentioned in another reply nobody in this situation put the kids first. The mother didn't care that it was a terrible situation to put the kids into and the father just didn't show up. The whole thing sounds traumatizing for the poor kids. Imagine spending a weekend with someone who can't even look at you and someone else who is super distracted and sad. It could have gone very badly but she was more worried about her trip than their welfare.\n\nAnd not showing up when expected would make them feel unimportant. Plus who knows what their mom said about why he wasn't there!\n\nThe only non AHs here are the kids and fiance. Probably the best thing OP can do is try to get her a spa weekend or something the next time the kids come over so she's getting pampered and looked after and he can focus on the kids. Because obviously their mom doesn't care about what it'll do to them being somewhere they know they aren't welcome, and can't understand why. Or at least hopefully someone can explain to the kids she still loves them but isn't feeling well, and maybe they can deal with her behavior. She'd have to deal with them eventually but as I said this is a medical issue as well as emotional, so at least a few days to heal would have helped.", "I love it when a Reddit disagreement ends with a clarifying of position and realising that you actually agree with the other person. Kudos, well done!", "No, Im sorry. Mom did nothing wrong expecting him to actually do his duty and fulfill his responsibilities to his existing children. A lot of what you\u2019re positing appears to be pure conjecture based on projection. Fact is we know from his custody arrangement that he is yet another lazy father in who expects the woman to do the vast majority of childcare despite him being 50% responsible. There are zero planets on which Mom should be responsible for taking care of his emotional needs and she has zero culpability in this situation.", ">But that was still a terrible environment to stick the kids into.\n\nSoooo....should parents that are still together not try for anymore children if they had miscarriages before their first because the possible miscarriages would put the kid into a 'terrible environment'?", "Best for the kids is not blowing them off for the last few times he was meant to have them. Best for the kids is not constantly reminding them his new wife is more important than them. Parenting is not a part time job. I bet anything if his current wife does have a baby he'll be one of those dads that phases his old kids out in favour of his new family. These kids are going to remember how dad just didn't bother to show up for them (which is extremely irresponsible of him and potentially putting them in a dangerous situation).", "I'm with you.  There was no other safe place for the kids to go but with mom.\n\nBut dad could have used this as a teachable moment...I can't spend the weekend with you, Faith isn't feeling well. She's having a hard time right now and needs me a little more than you. Could you give her a hug and kiss ( if they are this close already) and tell her you hope she feels better soon?\n\nFaith, too, has to be prepared for this.  She choose to be with a man with kids, a weekend to grieve isn't asking to much.  ... Hey Faith, the girls are going to come wish you well before going back to their mum's. .... And then be on hand to guide the situation.\n\nFailing to pick up his kids YTA\nAsking to rearrange things for your mailing partner NTA", "Oh yeah, she is totally fine sending the kids to a place that OP says his fiance was hurting every time she saw them is a sign of a loving mother who cares about her kids! /S\n\nOP says this is only the second time he asked for a change in weekends. And that he's seriously concerned about his fiance. And guess what, she went through a medical emergency as well as the loss no matter what you think. Miscarriage is messy and terrifying, and leaves her open to health issues especially in the beginning. \n\nIt sounds like you are projecting, calling OP a deadbeat. We don't know if his ex pushed for more custody, what the child support situation is, whether he's there for their birthdays and holidays. The majority of the time, unless the parents come to an agreement between themselves, one gets more time with the kids than the other.", "I was talking about the fact that she couldn't interact with them at all. Imagine being a kid and being somewhere that one of the adults couldn't even look at you! Plus she's still physically healing because of she was more than like two months along there are serious repercussions.", "Once again he's an AH and I've said it over and over. But their mom didn't display great parenting in this specific situation either.", "Asking, ok.\n\nExpecting? Assuming? Being entitled to? Whinging on about it on Reddit like you have any moral high ground?\n\nHELL NO that\u2019s not the way this works. Not even a little. I don\u2019t give a S he\u2019s grieving- parenting is 24/7. \n\nAs for Faith- as you point out she chose a man with two children- they are his- even when it\u2019s inconvenient.\n\nSuck it up.", "Yeah he made mistakes for sure and not showing up when his ex didn't agree to keep them was a total AH move. Their mother sending them into that environment knowing that Faith wasn't capable of helping and actually needed help herself was one too. Neither of the parents seemed to put the kids first and that's sad.", "Again- it matters not one whit what she went through when it\u2019s his turn to provide child care that is what he has to do. Full stop. That\u2019s what \u201cparenting\u201d means. I understand that you\u2019ve never actually been a parent so it\u2019s mostly abstract for you but when you\u2019re a real parent you simply don\u2019t get the luxury of choosing convenient times to be one.", ">Imagine being a kid and being somewhere that one of the adults couldn't even look at you!\n\nYou ignored everything I said. If we go by your logic kids of parents who have miscarriages should be sent to boarding school because mom can't look at her other children for even a single weekend.", "Well - they aren\u2019t married perhaps she can go to her own home or to a friends since her partner has to parent.", "I hope you never have to experience what they went through, but you might have a little empathy for a woman dealing with the fact her baby died (I don't care about scientific terms, in her mind that was her baby) plus the health issues she's likely dealing with. She hormonal, grieving, and probably feeling physically ill as well. He's grieving the loss of his child plus being concerned for his partner. That's not a good environment for the kids, and it's lucky nothing went sideways while they were there."]}
