It sounds like what you want would be to have your kids nearly all the time with some visitation rights for him and some child support for the kids.  That's a pretty standard arrangement in just about every US state, so you can pretty much expect that will happen.  In fact, it is VERY difficult to cut out any visitation unless he truly presents a danger to the kids.  He's a bum, but he doesn't sound like an abuser.\n\nHowever, being that he's a bum, be prepared for him to flake out on both visitation and support.  That'll be tough because he just might not show up some times and he will others.  You still have to abide by the order and respect his rights, but you can't force him to actually see the kids.

Them being excited that they may see Dad and than not is a lot harder than just knowing that they aren't going to see him.\n\nAnd sole legal or physical custody for you doesn't mean that Ex- couldn't have visitation. Heck, you aren't saying you don't want him to have visitation but you are acknowledging that he doesn't have a home to care for them in, nor does he seem interested.\n\nAs others have said- it's important to remember that child support isn't for you.

Calm down there.", "Child support is the right of the child and it isn\u2019t up to the parent to waive it on their behalf. Just bc it is paid to the adult, doesn\u2019t make it any less owed for the expenses of caring for the child.", "Well, I hope she would get that judge!", "Not to be an ass, but the OP of the comment literally directly said that child support is money that is 'owed to the child'....", "I just wanted to clarify. You might be surprised (or not) at how many people actually think that it belongs to the child. \n\nI\u2019ve known parents to give the child the money saying it\u2019s theirs and then the child spends it on candy or toys. This same parent then complains about not having enough Food Stamps.\n\nIt might be obvious to you or me, but it\u2019s not to everyone.", "Yes it's owed to the child. Not in a monetary sense in a literal support sense.\n\nExample if you did your friend a favor and your friend says they \"owe you one\" do you think they owe you actual money?\n\nAnother example if someone says \"you owe it to yourself\" would you take it as you literally owe yourself money?", "ok", "Right but the custodial parent is spending the money in lieu of the other parent NOT paying for the child's expenses on a regular basis. The money from the other parent is to pay the custodial parent back for taking care of their child, alone.\n\n***at least in this case, let me clarify***", "There is clearly a misunderstanding here?\n\nNo one is saying that the money is not for the child's expenses?", "Right but what I'm telling you is the money is directly owed to the custodial parent. Has nothing to do with effort from the non custodial parent to the child, it's about reimbursement to the custodial parent.", ">Has nothing to do with effort from the non custodial parent to the child\n\nWhat exactly do you mean here?", "> Yes it's owed to the child. Not in a monetary sense in a literal support sense.\n\nI am addressing this. Which you said.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nGo to court. Get this all settled legally.", "I hate to say this, he is NOT going to change. \nAs women we often make the mistake of thinking \"I can fix him. I can make him change\". But we can't. \n\nIt's time to let go and move on. At 28 you're still YOUNG and have a lot of life ahead of you. You deserve to be happy And have a man who loves you and is a real partner, not an overgrown teenager.\n\nDo yourself a favor and listen to everyone here. Get a lawyer, get custody and start over. Happiness awaits.\n\nNTA"]}
