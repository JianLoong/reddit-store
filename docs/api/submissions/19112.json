What you did was super thoughtful, and may have saved lives. Your deterrent helped keep everyone mindful of (at least some) of the consequences of their choices.  It also protected the dignity of your wedding. I have been to many weddings over the years, and the only one that still stands out to me was the one where a couple of drunken outsiders tried to crash the reception and were escorted out. One of them started a fight with the best man, and hit his head when he fell. He sued the best man, the venue and the bridal couple.   You and your parents were similarly at risk since you were the 'hosts' of an alcoholic event. You did what was necessary to protect yourself and the people that you cared about. Good for you!", "YTA. Hire a security guard if need be, but a fucking cop!?!?! Yikes! I would not attend a family wedding if they told me it would be literally policed. Jfc", "NTA. In fact pretty much all event venues around where I grew up require you to have security guards (and even a licensed bar tender) if there will be alcohol served. Usually the venue doesn\u2019t want to be liable for anything that happens when people are drunk and crazy.", "NTA. That sounds like a great idea!", "NTA, and the success of the event proves you were right. Congratulations on your wedding!", "Sounds like your wedding was a success....You are not an A.....", "Absolutely NTA and, quite honestly, why did you let your parents pay for the wedding if you knew alcohol might be a problem?", "NTA you are brilliant!!!", "NTA. You handled this situation brilliantly and with a great outcome. Your dad, for whatever reason, wanted everybody to be wasted at your wedding. Perhaps he's an alcoholic who wants company? Either way, it wasn't his wedding or his call, and he can STFU.", "NTA I\u2019ve had relatives take on those sort of gigs. It\u2019s more about prevention than anything. It is nice to have a little insurance too for people who get drunk and won\u2019t act right.", "**NTA** \\- You made an excellent decision.  Dad may have a booze problem.", "Brilliantly executed!\n\nNTA", "NTA. When my in laws got married 30 years ago apparently a drunken fist fight broke out between a member of the wedding party and some guests. Cops got called, arrests happened and I think someone was even sent to the hospital. Obviously not what you want to look back on and remember from your wedding day. What you did was smart.", "NTA! That's just good problem solving. You paid for it yourself, no one complained, no one got arrested or hurt anyone else. Where's the downside?", "NTA your dad needs to go to AA and rehab", "NTA Seems like you know what to expect from your family, so good idea to try to prevent the worst.", "NTA what a weird thing to be upset about. Is this supposed to be a Dathrake wedding? No killings, so it\u2019s considered a bad wedding?", "NTA, this idea needs to be spread everywhere for soon to be married couples with families that get way to drunk and fight at events. You're a genius, I'm glad it went well with no issues.", "NTA. I\u2019m so glad my extended family isn\u2019t into drinking much and doesn\u2019t get into drunken brawls. We\u2019re mostly stoners if anything. No need for all that drama.", "Oh totally NTA. You're looking out for the safety of your guests!

Brava, and congrats on your marriage!", "NTA\n\nIf you know your family gets rowdy when they drink, it\u2019s smart to have some form of deterrent. Also, you tried other reasonable solutions.

(I'm Northern English, that's something common up here lol)", "So no fisticuffs, DWI/DUI charges or arrests for any reason? People still consumed copious amounts of booze and seemingly had a good time? NTA", "NTA. Sounds like a good compromise, and no one getting arrested in your wedding is a reasonable request even if you are not paying for it.", "NTA\n\n_You_ paid for this, nobody else did.

Your dad paid for *your* wedding.\n\nAt the last minute, you added security. You didn\u2019t ask dad, but dad wasn\u2019t a party to the whole planning process, now was he? Down to every last detail? Of course not.\n\nGood for you for having a wedding that, for the first time in your family, was *not* like something from Game of Thrones!", "NTA for nipping shenanigans in the bud....and you probably started a precedent within your family.  Now others see they have options.", "NTA\n\nJust because your parents paid for the wedding doesn\u2019t mean that they can have whatever they want. Especially if what they wanted was a rowdy wedding with overly drunk grown adults partying like they are teenagers. It\u2019s a wedding not a frat house party. Being black out aggressive drunk is so irresponsible and dangerous anyways. \n\nYou compromised with having an open bar so they can compromise with your safety net-an off duty police officer present. It sounds like if you told them about the officer then that would try to control that too. I would have done the same and just hired him behind their back too. Also if you paid for for that then what does that matter to them?  Your dad sounds very unreasonable and weirdly dramatic. You\u2019re NTA here", "NTA.\n\nWhat a good solution to a persistent problem!

The fact that no one got in any legal trouble at a wedding (for the first time) should be proof enough you were absolutely correct", "NTA. Your father is annoyed that you found a work around for his controlling habit. Nobody had any issues, wedding was a success, but you found a way to keep your boundary and he doesn't like that. \n\nIf he brings it up ask him what his specific issue is, point out nobody has complained and everyone had an amazing time and he didn't look cheap as he had worried, so what specifically does he have a problem with.", "NTA. \n\nI find it weird they got upset because it's basically law here that once you have more than X amount of people you need some type of security in case people are dumb.", "YTA only because you never mentioned it. I would never want to go to a policed wedding, i wouldn't want a cop in uniform near me at all, not just at a wedding. I would leave the wedding but i would prefer to not waste my time at all going to that wedding.", "NTA. Just rephrase, \"AITA because I made sure no one got in a fight or arrested at my wedding?\"", "NTA - most venues in my area require security if you serve any alcohol anyway so it's actually a pretty standard thing to have an officer there.", "NTA.

No one likes being treated that way.

Let me guess, your family is Eastern European? I have been to a few weddings where a cop would probably have been a good idea. Maybe a SWAT team.

That makes no sense.", "Why not?? If she knows people will do illegal stuff at her event she is responsible. And as people have said, it is not actually uncommon to have security", "Mine did too. Over X amount of people with booze involved required a security guard. Luckily my mom's a cop and got a friend to do it for free.", "Yup, this is pretty standard for wedding venues to make you do this.", "But they obviously needed the oversight.

But a *uniformed* police officer is an aggressive move. In North America a lot of people have pretty severe trauma around police, and a lot of officers are loose cannons. If I went to a wedding and there was a uniformed officer was there I'd leave. I would feel very uncomfortable. OP should have put their foot down much earlier in the process rather than quietly bringing in an armed goon while no one was looking.", ">You should not bring a uniformed cop to an event that would not normally have one without letting people know.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, why not?"]}
