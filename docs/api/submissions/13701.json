It can tend to be used by people who want to signal they're not like those \"other\" autistic people. Which is the whole problem with the term in the first place, it was coined to separate out the 'useful' autistics from the ones who just got culled in the holocaust.\n\nLabel yourself however you want, I'm not gonna call you an AH for it.

I was diagnosed at 24 after years of struggling with sensory issues and social cues and rigidity. I was told during my diagnosis that I have Autism Spectrum Disorder level 2 (as in my support needs). And that I was text book, but by how well I articulate and present I probably would have been given a diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s if I had been evaluated as a child. That being said I personally prefer autistic/ASD as a term. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you really. I think that since that was the identity that you were given I think it\u2019s ok if you still use the word. But it poses an important topic, the stigma around the word autism. Asperger\u2019s almost seems to give you a pass and have people treat you how you\u2019re used to, but when using autism you are immediately infantilized. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, I think society is the overall asshole for adding this big negative context to a word that has now been used to describe a much bigger group of people than what was previously thought. \n\nThere needs to be a lot more research about Autism, but older generations will always have the context of \u201cAutism ruins marriages, lives, families\u201d. Use whatever word makes you more comfortable, it seems like it basically helps in your move through the Allistic world. Hopefully one day you\u2019ll feel comfortable using Autistic if the stigma ever dies. \n\nFunctioning labels are a whole other topic. It sadly is ableist as it implies more the affect the autistic person has on the people around them, more than it is about how the people and world affect the Autistic person. Functioning according to who? Society. Every Autistic person has their strengths and weaknesses just like Allistic people do. But where we have our deficits don\u2019t make us lesser.", "NTA.

I\u2019m not super well versed in what qualifies each person to be put into each category so I won\u2019t list off examples, but suffice to say using outdated terminology *for anyone but yourself* is in poor taste. Like saying \u201cdifferently abled\u201d \u201cre***ded\u201d or \u201ccrippled\u201d instead of \u201cdisabled\u201d. If someone wants to refer to themselves as such, it\u2019s no one\u2019s business but their own, but just remember that different people will prefer different terminology and it\u2019s easier to be understood when you are precise. \n\nAs a mid-needs level 2 autistic mother of a spicy level 3 toddler and an easy going level 1 teen whose great aunts and great uncles (and who knows how many cousins) were gassed for being Jews in Germany in the wrong decade, I personally prefer to distance myself from language that evolved from that era\n\nBut\n\nI\u2019m not you and so I will not make your decisions for you.
