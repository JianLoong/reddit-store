This class is meant for toddlers to get used to being in water so they do a lot of just trying to dip their faces in the water (for reference of the swim level we are at). Parents are in the pool with the kids at all times. As far as I'm aware, they are meant to move on to the next level by age 4 and start in a shallow pool without their parents.\n\nHowever there is a dad (maybe 40ish) and his son who I swear has to be around 5. They've been in the class the whole time we have and he's always been bigger and more comfortable swimming than the others. But this year he's absolutely unbearable. He is clearly fine in the water, he swims well and he swims quickly. There are times he's swimming by himself in the deep end of the pool without his dad anywhere near him. (I'd be fine with him staying over there the whole time honestly) He's typically doing whatever he wants and not listening to what the teacher is asking everyone to do, probably because he has no need to.\n\nThe problems start when he decides he wants to swim in the shallow end with everyone else. He ends up splashing all the little kids who aren't very comfortable with it and swimming past them very fast to take the toys that they were trying their best to swim towards (it's a treasure hunt game they play sometimes). His dad does absolutely nothing and seems to encourage it in my opinion.\n\nAt first I though maybe the kids was like a little special needs or maybe adhd and there was a reason he was in the toddler swim class but at this point I don't even care.... he can join the special needs swim class if that's the case.\n\nPlease someone tell me I would not be TA if I ask him wtf he's doing in this class and that he should at least be keeping his kid away from the smaller kids.\n\nEdit: Aight yall I get it. Ill try to bring it up with the teacher first, assuming his kid can stay away from mine for the 30 minutes we share the pool. I enjoyed the fun responses about elicit love affairs happening in my kids swim class (though I highly doubt that's the case). I was hoping for more insightful comments on how to bring it up due to family and family friends being involved and me not feeling comfortable with bringing it up to them but everyone just wanted to focus on different things. It is not my way or the highway. But if your comment can be argued, I will. And if your comment was just a boring \"go tell the teacher\" then it didn't need a response. Mostly I was just using reddit to get my frustrations out and I thank you for allowing me.

Is there a more suitable class for a child of his SWIMMING ABILITIES - focus on this, not his age, size or possible disability). He is likely bored in that class if he is already able to do those things, which might explain some of the behavior, but dad should put a stop to it if he is to stay.\n\nMany kids have ADHD or similar, but they can absolutely be taught how to behave in public (and still be themselves, just don't encroach on others). This is coming from 33 year old AuDHD who had to sit on her hands or walk with them behind her back through the mall not to touch everything and break things (just an example lol). It's appropriate for all kids whether neurotypical or not, to learn how to behave in society. (joke-we live in a society!)\n\nI for one hyper focused at school but would get bored if something was too easy or I did not like it. I still had to do it so my parents and teachers had to find ways around it like giving me extra work to do for fun or sending me to organize the library shelves (both of which I loved lol yes I was a nerd).\n\nIn the context of swimming perhaps the disruptive kid can be given additional, more challenging exercises to do with his dad at the other end of the pool/ away from littles with supervision by the teacher. He might just need more stimulation. There are ways for him to stay, and ways to gently approach him moving on to a more challenging and stimulating class on his level.\n\nHope this helps, like I said I'm AuDHD so when I read you wanted serious responses my brain decided to try and give you one!\n\nEdit: I forgot to add my judgment! Not that it matters, but I think NTA if you handle it gently and with kindness. Also, flatter them a little. Tell dad his kid is excelling and probably deserves to move up a class!
