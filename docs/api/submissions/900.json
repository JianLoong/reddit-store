For history, I had to find a place ASAP because an apartment situation fell through, and my friend offered (I have known her since middle school). \n\nA few months in, her husband would make comments asking if I wanted to sleep with him when she wasn't around (I am also a lesbian, which doesn't help the situation). It was in texts originally, but then he started coming to knock on my door when he'd get drunk and ask again. The past few months it's been happening at least once or twice a month. \n\nIt happened again this week, he came to my room and texted asking to sleep with me. I told one of my other friends and they offered to come get me, so I will be staying with them until I find a new place of my own. The friend in question was out of town on vacation, which opened me up to the position of him coming on to me again, but it also left me out of contact with her since I was in a rush trying to get all of my things out by the end of Halloween before the new month started. \n\nI was still trying to figure out how to tell her I was leaving (since I didn't have much and moved out in one day), as I didn't know how to tell her that her husband was trying to sleep with me and making advances without also risking losing her as a friend.\n\nShe texted me this morning afyer she got home with pictures of the empty room and bed I left (it was her bed before I moved in with her), and she said essentially that I betrayed her leaving so suddenly and that I left the place a mess, and then proceeded to block me on phone and social media. I was later sent a post she made about how I ghosted her and took advantage of her. I do admit, I should have swept and mopped before I left, that part I agree with her about. But I'm not sure if leaving at the end of the month after multiple advances and not feeling safe was wrong. (BTW they own the house, so there wasn't a signed lease and they weren't relying on me to pay their bills, plus they are a dual-income household)\n\nIs she right?
