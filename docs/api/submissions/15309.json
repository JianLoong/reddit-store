Should I feel bad for expecting her to want to do more at home than I do?? If she was working and I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure I would be doing a lot more at home to make her feel like her effort at work is appreciated\u2026.

Parenting, community work, etc. that aren't considered \"employment\" but that still take up a significant amount of their time?", "I\u2019m confused. Why does she have to audacity to behave this way? She literally has nothing else going on for her? No job? No school? No kids or pets? And she\u2019s crying over the 20 minutes of her day that\u2019s occupied?! Like,\u2026what?! Sorry, NTA.", "NTA she needs to do more if anything, you got the job, you do the cooking, you should only be taking out the trash", "Tell her you\u2019ll start pulling your weight when she puts hers and gets a job. No kids, no job, no real housework done, what does she do all day? I\u2019m guessing TikTok or insta \n\n\nNTA but \u2026 why? She doesn\u2019t respect you or all the work that you do to support both of you. Idk this would be a dealbreaker for me", "NTA\n\nYou do all the cooking and some of its cleanup. You pay groceries, utilities, rent, insurance and transportation.  Plus all the incidentals. She does shopping,  laundry, bathroom scrubbing, sweeping and mopping. \n\nThats decently split. Nothing else make the bed  and do 1 load of laundry on the weekends. Easy and fast not labor intensive .\n\nAll the couples I know that have 1 stay at home do it that way. They seem happy.\nIf she gets a part time job adjust house stuff accordingly.", "NTA.  If you\u2019re both able bodied and don\u2019t have incapacitating mental illness, it\u2019s reasonable to expect your partner to pull her share of the weight.  That means either getting a job (and splitting chores fairly evenly) or doing the majority of the household chores.  When you look at your week, each of you should have a similar amount of free time to do things you enjoy.  If you\u2019re not anywhere near that, it\u2019s reasonable for the person who is doing more to be frustrated at the person doing less, unless the reason is that they can\u2019t.", "Ask her if she's ready to start pulling her weight job wise and see how she responds.\n\nHer answer should be a good indicator of whether or not the relationship is doomed.\n\nNTA", "NTA for expecting a balance in chore distribution, considering you work full time and do all the cooking. However, communication is key in resolving this issue. Talk to your partner about how you feel and try to understand her perspective. Discuss a fair chore division that takes into account your work situation and how much each of you contributes. It's important to maintain open communication and work together to find a solution that feels fair to both of you.", "I think that you need to sit down and have a conversation about what expectations you each have about the relationship and what responsibilities you each have in the home.\n\nSounds like by bringing income into the relationship, you may think that you don't have to do particular things. Has that been communicated? If your gf hasnt got an income, who was doing all that stuff before for her? She probably has expectations of you too.", "If someone cooks for me, I pay for the ingredients *and* do all the dishes. Seems to be a fair trade.  \n\n\nYou're NTA, but instead of asking whether you're the asshole, you should be asking whether you really want someone like this in your life.", "NTA. It's understandable that you don't want to split all of the chores since you're working 40+ hours outside the home, and your gf isn't. When my partner and I relocated, and I wasn't yet employed, I did most of the chores at home. That only seemed fair. Once I got a full-time job, we split them. It sounds like you need to have a talk about the issue, expectations, and responsibilities. Understanding and compassion are key.", "I'm not saying she's in the right, I'm just trying to analyze her perspective\n\nShe's unemployed and home all of the time. To her, she sees everything in that house all of the time, and doesn't see you working. If you leave a mess anywhere, she is more likely to notice it because the space she's in constantly is suddenly altered. If she's cleaning messes that aren't hers and doing laundry that isn't hers, it probably starts to feel like, \"why am I doing this if it isn't my mess?\" She probably starts to feel like she's mothering you, \"taking care of her son who can't clean his room\" sort of thing. To clean up after someone a few times is one thing, but for your entire life to be cleaning someone else's messes is completely different. To her, it DOES only take a few minutes to clean, \"so why didn't he clean it instead of leaving this mess? It's only a few minutes, it's like he doesn't care about the home we've built.\" She probably feels like you don't do anything in the house because she's cleaning up after you every day and doesn't want that to be her \"job.\"\n\nIdk just seems like \"housewife\" isn't working out and she should find a hobby or easy gig she enjoys to get her out of the house and rejuvenate her understanding of why you \"do less\" around the home. She needs to find balance in order for you two to figure out a system that works.", "NTA assuming that there are no children and that you are not leaving anything out.  If what you are saying is accurate, you need to re-assess the relationship.", "maybe you should talk this out with her.", "NTA. Given that you're a girlfriend is never had a job, does she actually really appreciate what it means to go to work everyday all day?\n\nIt seems very entitled to not work and then expect your partner to do half of the house work too. She needs to get a job and contribute or you need to reassess this relationship. Already you're doing way more than you should.", "NTA\n\nAssuming from your post maintaining the home is her job and she has no outside obligations. \n\nI would say since you\u2019re doing the cooking, maintaining your own room and usually your own laundry you\u2019re doing enough. That doesn\u2019t mean that if she asks you to help her out here and there you shouldn\u2019t though.\n\nHas she explained what exactly she\u2019s expecting you to contribute housework wise? Like what aren\u2019t you doing that\u2019s pissing her off? Does she have anything physically preventing her from doing everything?\n\nI\u2019m SAHM and I\u2019m responsible for cooking and cleaning. I do my best but can\u2019t always do it because my daughter requires so much attention and I have chronic pain issues. So allot of my chores take much longer to complete.", "NTA. You mention no kids only a small dog in comments. And if she isn't working, I fail to see how asking you to do more than you're doing could be a remotely equitable split.\n\nHonestly I couldn't even fathom asking a partner for this if I wasn't working or on childcare, or had some other contribution taking up a similar amount of time.", "NTA. \nYou both need to talk this through. \n\nUsually, if one partner works full time and the other one doesn't have a job and is home all the time, it's clear who is doing most of the chores. \nIt's fair and absolutely valid. But you need to talk about it with each other. Like if there are certain chores she really hates, you could do them. While she has the responsibility to do the other stuff.\n\nMy husband and me have been like that for our entire relationship. He can't work due to mental health, so he does all the household stuff (besides the dishes. Those are mine to do), while I work full-time. \nIf he needs help or is sick, then of course I do more and help. \nBut in general, the housework is his sphere. Which is fine.\nWe talked about it and agreed upon it. \n\n\nIf your gf wants an equal split of chores, she has to get a job and work as much as you do. Then you two split chores equally.", "NTA if your paying for everything and you have no kids then she should be doing most of the cleaning and cooking", "INFO: What does she do all day?? \n\nI am not casting shade necessarily, but how does she fill all the hours with no job, no kids making messes, and just you two and the dog? I find that as someone who has the challenges of an aging body and old neurodiverse brain, our 2 person 1 dog household isn\u2019t terribly difficult to maintain while my SO continues to enjoy working full time. What did she do with her time when you met her? How was/is she productive? Has anything changed? \n\nNTA, but I\u2019m a bit concerned about your girlfriend if it\u2019s not just a case of delusional entitlement\u2026.", "NTA, you're literally the reason there's a roof over your guy's heads. She needs to be more appreciative that you don't make her do all the at home work.", "NTA. That\u2019s a lack of respect to you", "NTA. You both seem to be doing a fair amount. You\u2019re making income and she isn\u2019t, she\u2019s cleaning and you aren\u2019t. Same difference in my eyes", "YTA for valuing yourself so little.\n\nWhy are you settling for someone who brings nothing to the table? \n\nShe isn't a partner. She is a professional  layabout. \n\nYou are looking for someone to build a life with, not someone to be parasitic off of the life you build.\n\nHave some respect for yourself. Have some standards in who you associate with.", "INFO: DO YOU HAVE KIDS? Multiple people have asked. It's crucial to understanding this issue. Stop skating around it.", "NTA, it seems balanced to me", "NTA. You both need to communicate and split chores. I would avoid bringing up the job and her not working. You can talk about chores and pick one by one, be open about when you can manage your load or not, ask politely if you need help and the best one - mention one chore that you both respectively hate doing and offer to take that away from your partner. Ask for balance i.e. if you cook, she does the dishes. If you shovel, she mops and sweeps the inside. Roommate issues should not become relationship issues. She sounds like a bag but if you like her and want to continue growing with her, better to work on this chore communication sooner rather than later.", "INFO: Can you have her write down exactly what she does during the day? If the situation is exactly how you've described it then yeah your feelings are reasonable, but also if she's doing all the housework besides dishes it's hard to believe that's only 20 minutes, laundry alone would take longer than that. If kids and pets are in the picture that also changes things a lot.", "I'm gonna say ESH because neither of you are really appreciating what the other does. That's why y'all resent each other. And if you two don't do better, you're gonna end up killing your relationship.", "Don\u2019t know how to edit the post but I should have added that my partner also has high functioning autism and general anxiety anytime she is out in public and I don\u2019t need or expect her to be employed if she doesn\u2019t want to be. I was just really frustrated that she feels I don\u2019t do enough", "How much of a mess do you make?", "If you have kids, YTA\nIf you don't have, NTA\nIf no kids what dose she do all day and how is her bills being paid?", "YTA, if you're able to make your partner's \"20 minutes of tidying up\" even 19 minutes and you're not, that's on you. If the timing doesn't work out because of your job, then discuss what you can do in your work schedule, and take it from there.", "I'd love to say NTA... but it's a sticky situation...\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mother was the main breadwinner, and my father drifted through jobs. So parts of the year, I had a stay at home dad. He did zero housework. Because my mother was VERY controlling about how things got done. She would complain that ANY housework not done by HER was \"done wrong\" and \"I have to go back and do it RIGHT, so don't bother.\" But in the same breath complaining that my father and my sibling and I were lazy and needed to do more around the house, and that \"I do so much for everyone.\" (Bonus points for when she'd say \"Can you NOT SEE the mess\" on an already clean floor.)\n\nSo... we got yelled at for NOT doing housework, and yelled at FOR doing housework. Because she had a \"right\" way that only she knew.\n\nIf this is the kind of situation you're in, it's kind of a rock and hard place... best of luck. If not and your SO is a reasonable person, work out a plan of who does what and try and be flexible.", "NTA \n\nBut if the only chore you do is cooking then I can assure you she does more than \u201820 or so minutes a day\u2019 on everything else.\n\nSo while you may disagree with her proposed split, do not underestimate or downplay what the split currently is.\n\n(ETA: based on the line \u201cshe does do pretty much all the other housework\u201d)", "You\u2019re the asshole", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not sure how she copes with this and how much it impacts this specific behavior though.", "I don\u2019t care if she does any housework at all in a day it\u2019s not like this came up because I questioned her effort at home, it was her saying I wasn\u2019t doing enough so I was just trying to quantify both of our tasks on that specific day to show that I had actually done quite a lot already", "She could be more supportive by having an actual job and being a contributing adult.", "She should have a job.", "What the commenter is trying to say is \"Be better at pampering your GF - if she can save even 1 minute on cleaning, that's good and you should do that.\" Implying that not doing so is a \"lack of support\" and she needs to come first.", "Where do you see her doing more than him? He\u2019s the only one working, he does the cooking, they share dishes, and as far as I\u2019ve seen they have no kids. How does that make the work split make you think she does more?", "I feel like we spend a similar amount of time on domestic chores but I also spend around 10 hours a day working so I don\u2019t understand how she does more than me", "And not only is he working, he takes care of the cooking and cleans up after dinner\u2026 but yes, I hope they can find something that works for them both as well.", "Am I doubling down on being the asshole here? I really can\u2019t tell now", "Exactly", "When he said in the third sentence or so that she does \"all the other housework\", that to me very much gives the edge towards her in quantity. Quality I can't say. He specified 1.5 specific chores that he did, the cooking and half of the dishes. I don't know what \"all the other housework\" means, but in contrast to one listed chore that he did, that certainly sounds like the total is going to be more than 1.5 to me.", "Yea, he sounds pretty chill about it too. Hopefully they can come to an agreement before resentment builds on either side. If she's never worked she may not understand the stress of it fully. Also the stress of financial failure is scary. Dude, life is scary lol", "You are not. If SHE is insisting you don't do enough, ask her what help she needs / wants from you.", "If she\u2019s not working, she shouldn\u2019t she be doing ALL of the housework?

I wish them well.", "I have asked this and she wants me to split the chores with her, she says we should be putting in equal effort at home.

I wish you well as well, kind stranger!", "OP she doesn\u2019t get to have her cake and eat it too \u2014 if she wants to play housewife then she needs to pull her weight.

If you both worked full time then yeah I would split everything down the middle. But you do all of the cooking which is a time consuming thing and some of the dishes and work full time. I honestly think that is more than enough. Feels like she isn't taking into account you working. Maybe since she has never worked before she doesn't understand how exhausting work can be.", "And I you!", "NTA tell her shee needs to then pull her financial weight and get a fucking job. I cannot stand a gotdamed mooch and if she doesn\u2019t want to contribute by maintaining the home, she needs to work and pay some bills.", "Damn bruh NTA \n\nI wish my autism was a valid excuse not to cook and clean. Can i move in?", "NTA. A lot of couples now have both partners working jobs, but if only one is, the other should be responsible for the house; pretty much solely, especially if they don't have kids. If you are working a full-time job and providing all of the money, she should be cooking, cleaning, taking care of the dog, shopping, (if she has autism then even just picking out groceries online and doing a home delivery), cooking and anything else that needs to be done at home. That's a very fair division of labor, especially on her end, as the homemaker person usually doesn't put in as much physical or mental work as the breadwinner if there's no kids. She should be taking care of the vast majority of the housework. \n\nAnd to be clear I would say the exact same thing if OP was a woman and the gf was a man. It's not a gender thing; my siblings who were adopted by another family have a stay-at home dad who takes care of almost everything house related except for a few small chores that their mom enjoys doing, and she goes to work 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week and brings home the bacon. By the time she's home at around 6, dad has everything cleaned up, the kids are home, and dinner is usually in the process of being made. House is clean, homework is usually done, the dogs and cats are fed, etc. And she's done a whole days work as well, and is financially supporting them. And they usually are able to chill after she comes home and have fun time, since they both got their work taken care of.\n\nObviously this isn't how it is for everyone, as some couples need to work two jobs. but in this situation, ESPECIALLY since you don't have kids or a ton of pets, just one doggo, there's no reason why she shouldn't have everything done by the time you're home. It's not a ton if you don't have kids, to be brutally honest.", "Nta. As per you're edit your girlfriend has high functioning autism and anxiety. The obstacle she faces is she can't go out and will suffer anxiety attacks etc if she does tend to go out for extended periods of time hence why she is not currently working. You've accepted this, which I salute you for because not many would, but now you have to start looking at alternative solutions. You're bringing in the whole of the household finances, you're supporting yourself and your girlfriend in every aspect financially, youre girlfriend does a few household chores which to me is very disproportionate and is now expecting you to do more. I don't find it unreasonable that in return you expect her to do more. If getting a job outside of the home is a definite no then there are plenty of online courses available your gf could take if you are willing to initially foot the bill. That way she could then proceed to take a work from home job which would then solve the issues of working outside while also bringing in an extra income to the household and make things more fair between you. If she declines that suggestion then tbh I'd say your gf is just sponging off you because you've allowed it for so long and it is what she has been used to her whole life. You may be happy now to support that but there will come a time where you won't be as happy and start to resent your gf for it.", "NTA, she's \\*never\\* worked?\n\nYou're working 6 days a week?\n\nNope, fuck that, she should be doing \\*100%\\* of housework, including cooking.\n\nHer perspective isn't reasonable, you bankroll her entire life, work six days a week and she still wants more?\n\nYou're way more understanding than 99% of partners would be, she needs to buck up her ideas and pull her weight.", "NTA.

If me pulling all the weight at home can give him some peace then I\u2019m happy to. That is what is equal for us. We tell each other everyday we appreciate the other\u2019s hard work :)\n\nYour GF probably feels isolated at home and chores often are a thankless job.

If you read OP's edit, his partner is autistic and has generalised anxiety disorder. It's not easy for neurodivergent people to find or keep jobs.

Does she have a social life at all?\n\nOp definitely needs to be tidying up after himself and not making messes - she's not the maid. If op is finding cooking a fresh meal everyday too much, then I recommend batch cooking or meal prepping. Something op should also consider is longer term, if they have kids (or move to a bigger place) that greatly affect the amount of work she will be doing, which mean he will have to do more around the house chores to rebalance.  \n\nI'm glad he's taking he seriously, I think they should sit down go through all the task (maybe use Fair Play), discuss who is doing them and why. Then they both would get clearer picture of who is doing exactly what and how much time that takes up.

If she says the dog is too much of a commitment then let her know that the dog is the thing that has to go. You have to make it clear that you need a partner, not a burden. She needs some real talk and to grow up. So you really need to lay out how you expect to work as a team if she is choosing to be unemployed and not contributing in those ways. And it needs to be the hill you die on.", "I\u2019m not gonna call you an AH bc you\u2019re already too pitiful. Your girlfriend wears the pants and the balls and is in total control.

My husband works a very physical job with over an hour commute each way. Luckily, he works 4-10 hour days.\n\nHe finally makes enough money that I was able to quit my retail job a few years ago. We have 4 dogs (his choice, not mine lol) and my dad is getting older and needs rides to lots of doctor appointments. Then, about a year and a half ago, we started fostering and will probably adopt our nephew (on my husband's side). He was still a baby when he moved in, and is now two. Our only \"kid\" is 22, still lives with us, but works with my husband/his dad and doesn't really add much to my workload. We had just bought a bigger house with a much bigger yard before our nephew came to live with us. \n\nI will literally do everything possible to clean and maintain our house and property. My guys come home to dinner ready, or minutes away from being ready every night. They work so hard and have such long days that I expect almost 0 help from either of them because I'm home all day, every day. All I ask is that they try to pick up after themselves, because I openly admit I have a problem with wanting our house to be spotless. I have multiple case workers visiting monthly because of our nephew, and I just expect things to be perfect. I mow the lawn when nephew is napping so my husband doesn't have to on his days off. None of this is expected of me, I love my husband and son so much, and want to make their lives easier.\n\nDoes my husband still help out around the house? Of course! He's been clearing dead and dying trees out of the woods out back, is usually the one to wash/vacuum our cars, will cook some of the meals on his weekend and stuff like that.
