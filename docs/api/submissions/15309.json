Should I feel bad for expecting her to want to do more at home than I do?? If she was working and I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure I would be doing a lot more at home to make her feel like her effort at work is appreciated\u2026. Edit I should have added that my partner also has high functioning autism and general anxiety anytime she is out in public and I don\u2019t need or expect her to be employed if she doesn\u2019t want to be.

Parenting, community work, etc. that aren't considered \"employment\" but that still take up a significant amount of their time?", "I\u2019m confused. Why does she have to audacity to behave this way? She literally has nothing else going on for her? No job? No school? No kids or pets? And she\u2019s crying over the 20 minutes of her day that\u2019s occupied?! Like,\u2026what?! Sorry, NTA.", "NTA she needs to do more if anything, you got the job, you do the cooking, you should only be taking out the trash", "Tell her you\u2019ll start pulling your weight when she puts hers and gets a job. No kids, no job, no real housework done, what does she do all day? I\u2019m guessing TikTok or insta \n\n\nNTA but \u2026 why? She doesn\u2019t respect you or all the work that you do to support both of you. Idk this would be a dealbreaker for me", "NTA\n\nYou do all the cooking and some of its cleanup. You pay groceries, utilities, rent, insurance and transportation.  Plus all the incidentals. She does shopping,  laundry, bathroom scrubbing, sweeping and mopping. \n\nThats decently split. Nothing else make the bed  and do 1 load of laundry on the weekends. Easy and fast not labor intensive .\n\nAll the couples I know that have 1 stay at home do it that way. They seem happy.\nIf she gets a part time job adjust house stuff accordingly.", "NTA.  If you\u2019re both able bodied and don\u2019t have incapacitating mental illness, it\u2019s reasonable to expect your partner to pull her share of the weight.  That means either getting a job (and splitting chores fairly evenly) or doing the majority of the household chores.  When you look at your week, each of you should have a similar amount of free time to do things you enjoy.  If you\u2019re not anywhere near that, it\u2019s reasonable for the person who is doing more to be frustrated at the person doing less, unless the reason is that they can\u2019t.", "Ask her if she's ready to start pulling her weight job wise and see how she responds.\n\nHer answer should be a good indicator of whether or not the relationship is doomed.\n\nNTA", "NTA for expecting a balance in chore distribution, considering you work full time and do all the cooking. However, communication is key in resolving this issue. Talk to your partner about how you feel and try to understand her perspective. Discuss a fair chore division that takes into account your work situation and how much each of you contributes. It's important to maintain open communication and work together to find a solution that feels fair to both of you.", "I think that you need to sit down and have a conversation about what expectations you each have about the relationship and what responsibilities you each have in the home.\n\nSounds like by bringing income into the relationship, you may think that you don't have to do particular things. Has that been communicated? If your gf hasnt got an income, who was doing all that stuff before for her? She probably has expectations of you too.", "If someone cooks for me, I pay for the ingredients *and* do all the dishes. Seems to be a fair trade.  \n\n\nYou're NTA, but instead of asking whether you're the asshole, you should be asking whether you really want someone like this in your life.", "NTA. It's understandable that you don't want to split all of the chores since you're working 40+ hours outside the home, and your gf isn't. When my partner and I relocated, and I wasn't yet employed, I did most of the chores at home. That only seemed fair. Once I got a full-time job, we split them. It sounds like you need to have a talk about the issue, expectations, and responsibilities. Understanding and compassion are key.", "I'm not saying she's in the right, I'm just trying to analyze her perspective\n\nShe's unemployed and home all of the time. To her, she sees everything in that house all of the time, and doesn't see you working. If you leave a mess anywhere, she is more likely to notice it because the space she's in constantly is suddenly altered. If she's cleaning messes that aren't hers and doing laundry that isn't hers, it probably starts to feel like, \"why am I doing this if it isn't my mess?\" She probably starts to feel like she's mothering you, \"taking care of her son who can't clean his room\" sort of thing. To clean up after someone a few times is one thing, but for your entire life to be cleaning someone else's messes is completely different. To her, it DOES only take a few minutes to clean, \"so why didn't he clean it instead of leaving this mess? It's only a few minutes, it's like he doesn't care about the home we've built.\" She probably feels like you don't do anything in the house because she's cleaning up after you every day and doesn't want that to be her \"job.\"\n\nIdk just seems like \"housewife\" isn't working out and she should find a hobby or easy gig she enjoys to get her out of the house and rejuvenate her understanding of why you \"do less\" around the home. She needs to find balance in order for you two to figure out a system that works.", "NTA assuming that there are no children and that you are not leaving anything out.  If what you are saying is accurate, you need to re-assess the relationship.", "maybe you should talk this out with her.", "NTA. Given that you're a girlfriend is never had a job, does she actually really appreciate what it means to go to work everyday all day?\n\nIt seems very entitled to not work and then expect your partner to do half of the house work too. She needs to get a job and contribute or you need to reassess this relationship. Already you're doing way more than you should.", "NTA\n\nAssuming from your post maintaining the home is her job and she has no outside obligations. \n\nI would say since you\u2019re doing the cooking, maintaining your own room and usually your own laundry you\u2019re doing enough. That doesn\u2019t mean that if she asks you to help her out here and there you shouldn\u2019t though.\n\nHas she explained what exactly she\u2019s expecting you to contribute housework wise? Like what aren\u2019t you doing that\u2019s pissing her off? Does she have anything physically preventing her from doing everything?\n\nI\u2019m SAHM and I\u2019m responsible for cooking and cleaning. I do my best but can\u2019t always do it because my daughter requires so much attention and I have chronic pain issues. So allot of my chores take much longer to complete.", "NTA. You mention no kids only a small dog in comments. And if she isn't working, I fail to see how asking you to do more than you're doing could be a remotely equitable split.\n\nHonestly I couldn't even fathom asking a partner for this if I wasn't working or on childcare, or had some other contribution taking up a similar amount of time.", "NTA. \nYou both need to talk this through. \n\nUsually, if one partner works full time and the other one doesn't have a job and is home all the time, it's clear who is doing most of the chores. \nIt's fair and absolutely valid. But you need to talk about it with each other. Like if there are certain chores she really hates, you could do them. While she has the responsibility to do the other stuff.\n\nMy husband and me have been like that for our entire relationship. He can't work due to mental health, so he does all the household stuff (besides the dishes. Those are mine to do), while I work full-time. \nIf he needs help or is sick, then of course I do more and help. \nBut in general, the housework is his sphere. Which is fine.\nWe talked about it and agreed upon it. \n\n\nIf your gf wants an equal split of chores, she has to get a job and work as much as you do. Then you two split chores equally.", "NTA if your paying for everything and you have no kids then she should be doing most of the cleaning and cooking", "INFO: What does she do all day?? \n\nI am not casting shade necessarily, but how does she fill all the hours with no job, no kids making messes, and just you two and the dog? I find that as someone who has the challenges of an aging body and old neurodiverse brain, our 2 person 1 dog household isn\u2019t terribly difficult to maintain while my SO continues to enjoy working full time. What did she do with her time when you met her? How was/is she productive? Has anything changed? \n\nNTA, but I\u2019m a bit concerned about your girlfriend if it\u2019s not just a case of delusional entitlement\u2026.", "NTA, you're literally the reason there's a roof over your guy's heads. She needs to be more appreciative that you don't make her do all the at home work.", "NTA. That\u2019s a lack of respect to you", "NTA. You both seem to be doing a fair amount. You\u2019re making income and she isn\u2019t, she\u2019s cleaning and you aren\u2019t. Same difference in my eyes", "YTA for valuing yourself so little.\n\nWhy are you settling for someone who brings nothing to the table? \n\nShe isn't a partner. She is a professional  layabout. \n\nYou are looking for someone to build a life with, not someone to be parasitic off of the life you build.\n\nHave some respect for yourself. Have some standards in who you associate with.", "INFO: DO YOU HAVE KIDS? Multiple people have asked. It's crucial to understanding this issue. Stop skating around it.", "NTA, it seems balanced to me", "NTA. You both need to communicate and split chores. I would avoid bringing up the job and her not working. You can talk about chores and pick one by one, be open about when you can manage your load or not, ask politely if you need help and the best one - mention one chore that you both respectively hate doing and offer to take that away from your partner. Ask for balance i.e. if you cook, she does the dishes. If you shovel, she mops and sweeps the inside. Roommate issues should not become relationship issues. She sounds like a bag but if you like her and want to continue growing with her, better to work on this chore communication sooner rather than later.", "INFO: Can you have her write down exactly what she does during the day? If the situation is exactly how you've described it then yeah your feelings are reasonable, but also if she's doing all the housework besides dishes it's hard to believe that's only 20 minutes, laundry alone would take longer than that. If kids and pets are in the picture that also changes things a lot.", "I'm gonna say ESH because neither of you are really appreciating what the other does. That's why y'all resent each other. And if you two don't do better, you're gonna end up killing your relationship.", "Don\u2019t know how to edit the post but I should have added that my partner also has high functioning autism and general anxiety anytime she is out in public and I don\u2019t need or expect her to be employed if she doesn\u2019t want to be. I was just really frustrated that she feels I don\u2019t do enough", "How much of a mess do you make?", "If you have kids, YTA\nIf you don't have, NTA\nIf no kids what dose she do all day and how is her bills being paid?", "YTA, if you're able to make your partner's \"20 minutes of tidying up\" even 19 minutes and you're not, that's on you. If the timing doesn't work out because of your job, then discuss what you can do in your work schedule, and take it from there.", "I'd love to say NTA... but it's a sticky situation...\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mother was the main breadwinner, and my father drifted through jobs. So parts of the year, I had a stay at home dad. He did zero housework. Because my mother was VERY controlling about how things got done. She would complain that ANY housework not done by HER was \"done wrong\" and \"I have to go back and do it RIGHT, so don't bother.\" But in the same breath complaining that my father and my sibling and I were lazy and needed to do more around the house, and that \"I do so much for everyone.\" (Bonus points for when she'd say \"Can you NOT SEE the mess\" on an already clean floor.)\n\nSo... we got yelled at for NOT doing housework, and yelled at FOR doing housework. Because she had a \"right\" way that only she knew.\n\nIf this is the kind of situation you're in, it's kind of a rock and hard place... best of luck. If not and your SO is a reasonable person, work out a plan of who does what and try and be flexible.", "NTA \n\nBut if the only chore you do is cooking then I can assure you she does more than \u201820 or so minutes a day\u2019 on everything else.\n\nSo while you may disagree with her proposed split, do not underestimate or downplay what the split currently is.\n\n(ETA: based on the line \u201cshe does do pretty much all the other housework\u201d)", "You\u2019re the asshole", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you are working a full-time job and providing all of the money, she should be cooking, cleaning, taking care of the dog, shopping, (if she has autism then even just picking out groceries online and doing a home delivery), cooking and anything else that needs to be done at home. That's a very fair division of labor, especially on her end, as the homemaker person usually doesn't put in as much physical or mental work as the breadwinner if there's no kids. She should be taking care of the vast majority of the housework. \n\nAnd to be clear I would say the exact same thing if OP was a woman and the gf was a man. It's not a gender thing; my siblings who were adopted by another family have a stay-at home dad who takes care of almost everything house related except for a few small chores that their mom enjoys doing, and she goes to work 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week and brings home the bacon. By the time she's home at around 6, dad has everything cleaned up, the kids are home, and dinner is usually in the process of being made. House is clean, homework is usually done, the dogs and cats are fed, etc. And she's done a whole days work as well, and is financially supporting them. And they usually are able to chill after she comes home and have fun time, since they both got their work taken care of.\n\nObviously this isn't how it is for everyone, as some couples need to work two jobs. but in this situation, ESPECIALLY since you don't have kids or a ton of pets, just one doggo, there's no reason why she shouldn't have everything done by the time you're home.

I don't find it unreasonable that in return you expect her to do more. If getting a job outside of the home is a definite no then there are plenty of online courses available your gf could take if you are willing to initially foot the bill. That way she could then proceed to take a work from home job which would then solve the issues of working outside while also bringing in an extra income to the household and make things more fair between you. If she declines that suggestion then tbh I'd say your gf is just sponging off you because you've allowed it for so long and it is what she has been used to her whole life.

I know my friend with autism has complained of the same experience. That's when I'll usually need my bf to help, just to get me started because someone else starting will get me unstuck, and someone else giving me a game plan can make it way easier when I'm overwhelmed. For me just him initiating \"we should do a quick tidy, I'll do the LR and you get the kitchen?\" and us both spending 10 minutes giving things a quick once-over is usually enough to get me unstuck, and also to not make me feel like the maid.

The tone was set before that edit.\n\nWe're all autistic in my house. You need to work on communication. This is just a communication problem and should not have been brought to AITA, the land of finger pointing. You're a team, not opponents. \n\nIf she's finding the house work she does overwhelming then maybe there's a way to make it less overwhelming. After my ADHD diagnosis I was recommended a book called something like \"organizing solutions for people with ADHD\" and it laid a plan out for reorganizing the house to make it easier to keep functional and an ADHD friendly way to tidy/clean, maybe something like that would help. I know you didn't say she was ADHD but executive dysfunction is symptomatic of both.\n\nBut, basically, you shouldn't have done this.\n\nAfter reading more of your comments I have more recommendations. I can't handle big shops and before our child was born I used to do grocery shopping online. It would take me about 4 hours or so because I'd plan meals and I'm slow at these things but my husband took over after our daughter was born because he does a less precise job and we eat worse but he can knock it out in 45 minutes. We're all autistic but we have different skills.\n\nOnline grocery shopping, since you do all the cooking it may just make more sense for you to just have this take entirely. She can put things away. She may struggle with people coming to her home.\n\nSuggestion, try to get whatever disability benefits you can. She'll probably need help to do this but disability benefit is nice to have. I spend all mine on a cleaner we get once a week who I clean with (body doubling).\n\nSome tasks are going to be easier for her and some are going to be easier for you (like shopping). If there's a task that would take her 6x as long it probably makes more sense for you to do it or to do it with her so she can get more practice with it.\n\nIf she's asking you to body double (split chores sounds like she might be asking to body double but doesn't have the words) then you don't necessarily have to be doing the same task to get the results of body doubling and, added bonus, since you're nearby she can ask for \"planning help\" as I call it when she has too many options and doesn't know which one to do (this can cause paralysis and people can lose a lot of time this way, it's rubbish).\n\nI was a stay a home before we had a child because work was crazy bad for me. Having full control of all house tasks worked better for me because I operate better with full control and my husband just helped when I asked him or if he wanted to. Eg, if I was putting laundry away and he helped them he got the pleasure of my company and the task got finished faster so we could get to doing fun things together sooner. Win win.\n\nThis is just a problem you can solve together. No more finger pointing from either of you, please. You're a team. \n\nDamn this is a long comment and no one will read it. Oh well. You might, it might help.\n\nAlternatively, decide you don't want to be in a long term relationship with a disabled person and break up. Up to you. You don't have to stay in a relationship just because you're functionally a carer. Leaving is always an option for the both of you if this team doesn't work.\n\nADHD meds helped me a lot too but that's because I have ADHD. Can't exactly recommend that in this case. \n\nOh oh also appreciate that what would take you 20 minutes probably doesn't take her 20 minutes.", "NTA\n\nBut I do have to ask, do you do the bare minimum in addition to the cooking.

There are books and YouTube videos for this. When I clean and there are a million (exaggeration) tasks that are so overwhelming that it's difficult to start I try to develop an algorithm for how I'm going to do it. That helps me. Also body doubles. But we have a cleaner once a week that I clean with to get us back to \"zero\" so I'm not sure I can really talk. It eats all my disability benefit but I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nTimers also help me if the task is a big one.
