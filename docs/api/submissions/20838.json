I am very happily child-free and consistently tell everyone in my family that I and husband do no want anything to do with kids, or babies, ever. Now, my mother has fought for months on end with my younger sister who lives states away from us, to let her watch her granddaughter (3 yrs old) for the entirety of the summer. After being hounded with constant phone calls and texts to the point of my sister calling me in a mental break down begging me to take moms phone away, she relented, mom can watch the baby for the summer. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we have the kid, mom is loudly lamenting about how much trouble this toddler is being, how much money she\u2019s wasted on her granddaughter to feed her, pushing the kid off on her own mother (D) to watch every day. Well  D went to a wedding which means no one can watch the kid. Mom decided to clean a friends Airbnb, she has asked everyone, including my other sister, whose only 12, to watch the baby. Everyone has told her no. Finally she asked me to watch my niece. I told her no, absolutely not, not even if she paid me what she was offering to, I want nothing to do with children. She called me selfish and screamed at me about how I\u2019m awful for not helping her, she\u2019s always so stressed with this kid, no one has ever helped in her entire life, etc etc. I feel bad for the kid, because ofc she deserves love and attention, but I don\u2019t want anything to do with her, So, AITA here?\n\nEdited for more info: the kids mom is using the summer to work so she can have a better place to live with the kid. Normally grandma (who went to an unplanned wedding) takes care of the kid, which is the only reason my sister hasn\u2019t taken her back yet.", "created_utc": 1687979606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14li9zq/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_niece/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A whole summer is too long to be away from primary caregivers at that age. If it were me I would do it just for a refreshing reminder why I want to stay child free.", "NTA she whined and whined and whined about wanting to look after the kid over summer, so she needs to shut up and deal with it.", "Jeez, be honest why don't you?! LOL. I mean it's clear you want nothing to do with kids but if I were you I'd be calling your sister to come get her kid cuz the way your mom is acting is not ok.

Not your circus not your monkey", "NTA. But have you at least checked in to be sure your niece is safe? That doesn\u2019t mean you have to like the child or watch her, but at least make sure she\u2019s not being hurt. \n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, call your sister and have her come pick up her child!!!", "NTA, she made her bed now she has to lie in it.", "You know who you are, what you want and don\u2019t want.

It always irritates me that someone uses name-calling to manipulate. They're the ones being selfish, but instead, call you that because you're not doing what they want you to do. This mother begged for this opportunity and now is treating it like a huge burden. I would call your sister and suggest she pick up her child since obviously, mom is in over her head.", "Nta but call your sister and tell her whats going on", "NTA/ your mother demanded full responsibility  of this child and didn\u2019t arrange additional support for when she needed a break. She assumed that everyone would drop their lives so she could play grandmother on her terms. \n\nThis is a good learning curve for her and hopefully she\u2019ll never ask again.", "NTA as you have made your boundaries clear but I am very concerned for this child that is in a toxic at best and borderline abusive scenario. Mum needs to pick up child pronto and not get worn down or emotionally blackmailed into this kind of fuckery again", "NTA. Your mom begged and begged for this and now doesn't want to do it anymore, which is why you're all in this situation to begin with. Your sister is A H too for not listening to you and just trying to guilt you into doing things you don't want to do. And guess what? When you have kids, you sometimes have to give up events that you wish to go to when you don't have childcare lined up. That's just reality. Nobody else in this scenario forced her to have that kid. It's her problem, she can just not go to the wedding. You're the only one here who isn't being an A H to be honest.\n\nEDIT - Just went back and re read and realized the sister who is the mother of the kid is states away still at this point, and it's the rest of the family who is pushing this. Still, it's the mom who wanted this, so she can suck it up. Not your circus not your monkey.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I have many friends who are also child averse and I would *never* want them to be in charge of any children because....they don't like kids. It's that simple. Your mom begged for the responsibility a having a 3-year old child for an entire summer and now she has to bear that burden.", "NtA \u2014 your mom sounds like kind of a mess. Y\u2019all should draw lines with her, and you are, so that\u2019s good.", "NTA Your mom created the situation. But someone needs to call the child's mother, because this sounds like it is not working out for anyone.", "NTA - It's not your responsibility. I'm assuming your family know your views. The kid really needs to be with her mum if grandma can't cope.  It's not fair on you to look after the kid especially one so young they are hard work and will only make you resent children more.", "NTA. She begged for the summer.
