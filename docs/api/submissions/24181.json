My voice is also a bit deeper than others my age. I am also part of a group that organises camps for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAnyways, I went on one of these camps a few days ago and our group consisted of about 40 people. In the beginning we were asked to introduce ourselves and if you wanted, you could state what part of the LGBTQ+ community you were. When it was my turn, I said my name and that I'm a lesbian, and that was that.\nLater that day we got divided into groups for rooms, and I shared a room with 3 others.\nWhile making our beds, one of them asked if I was only a lesbian and nothing else. I said yes and she shrugged. I brushed this off since I thought she was just curious.\nBut the next evening, after all our activities, we got some free time before we had to sleep. Our other roommates were out to do something (I forgot what) and only me and that one girl were left.\nShe asked the same question, and once again I replied that I'm only lesbian. I also asked why she keeps asking me. And then she said 'I see right through you.' Confused, I asked what she meant and she said 'I can tell that you're transgender'. This really took me off guard and I said I wasn't. She said I could be honest with her and that she wouldn't tell anyone, but that it was very obvious to her.\nOnce again, I tell her I'm not. I also ask why she would think that. \nShe says she can tell by my face, the way how it's built and how I have a deeper voice than a normal girl my age. This pisses me off, as at one point I was very insecure about these things due to people thinking I was a man in the past when I had shorter hair. Pissed off, I tell her she's wrong and she shrugs, smiling. She starts saying how she doesn't judge and without thinking, I pull down my pants and ask if this proves enough. She looks shocked and runs out the room.\nI felt bad for acting so impulsively but yeah. She went to a counselor and I had to have a talk with them. I ended up getting suspended from the camp.\nSo, AITA? Obviously there's nothing wrong with being transgender, but as I'm not I didn't want to be seen like I am as again I had been insecure about being 'too masculine' in the past. I feel a bit guilty but I felt like at that moment I had no other choice.\nEDIT: The girl was also 18, I didn't flash a minor (should've specified this earlier)", "created_utc": 1691491548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lem1o/aita_for_unsolicitedly_showing_my_private_parts/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You needing to prove you're a cis woman does not trump that.\n\nShe was out of line and you snapped. I get it. I'm a 5'11 cis woman, with a strong Slavic jawline and swimmer's shoulders and I speak in my lower register coz I prefer it. Transphobes think they can \"always tell\". They can't tell shit. But you shouldn't gaf what people like that think, definitely not enough to flash them. Your emotions are valid, but your actions were not.\nNext time complain to a counselor or tell the person to stop harassing you.\nOr in my experience this response works really well \"why do you care what I have in my pants? I promise it's never gonna be *your* problem. Stop being creepy\"", "Next time just go grab your pads or tampons or whatever out of your bag as proof.

You never know when you\u2019ll need one in an emergency.", "YTA. What you did was sexual harassment. Sure she was awful for harassing you about your identity, but imo that doesn\u2019t come near your actions. Flashing people is harassment and there\u2019s no justification.

That doesn\u2019t make you an A, just means you need some help and support finding better ways to vent your frustrations / anger. Suspending you was not right, you need support and this other girl needs some education to fight her obviously close-minded and prejudiced mindset. I hope your family and friends are showing a little more empathy than this camp.", "ESH, YTA for flashing her you should have talked to staff about her harassing you not sexually harassed her in retaliation. That's indecent exposure and it is a crime.\n\nWhat she was saying and doing was disgusting and wrong but your response is literally one of the worst things you could have done\n\nAlso showing her your vulva means nothing- some trans women have vulvas too and if she's that brainwormed she probably still went away thinking you're post bottom surgery and trying to 'trick' her TERFS / GCs / Transvestigators like this will literally harass new birthing mothers accusing them of being trans women becauae they are fuckwits\n\nDon't be a fuckwit to try to out fuckwit them it doesn't work you can't", "ESH\n\nShe's an asshole for insisting, you're an asshole for flashing.

Lmao.\n\nESH", "YTA. You have to learn to handle it when people are irritating in a mature way. She 100% crossed a line by claiming you were trans due to your voice being deeper or some bullshit. But flashing someone is too extreme of a reaction. \n\nI genuinely feel bad that you were invalidated. You deserved better. But you also have to learn when to let things go/how far to escalate. It\u2019s something I have to learn too tbh", "YTA. You don't show anyone your genitals without their consent. If their harassment was causing you a problem, you should've gone to a counsellor.", "YTA showing your sexual organs without consent is absolutely never okay! NEVER! \nShe was annoying, but she was \u2018just\u2019 verbally harassing you, you on the other hand sexually jar raised her by exposing yourself indecently. She is also the asshole, but you should have simply gone to a council.", "Yes. You just sexually harrassed  another person by showing your genitals without their consent. Learn how to control yourself. You're very lucky no one called the police. Pull this shit in another location, and you might be looking at registering as a sex offender.", "YTA, this is sexual assault. It\u2019s never ok to show someone your genitalia without consent. What the the other person did is awful and verbally abusive and when she didn\u2019t stop the 1st time you should have gone to a counselor. You need to seriously take some time to develop better coping skills because if you ever do this again you could face legal repercussions. The fact that you even thought this was OK is astounding! Do you have other impulse control issues, do you maybe have ADHD or autism?", "Seems pretty self explanatory how you're TA", "Yta but totally justified for it. She wouldn't accept your word and kept pushing the issue. She'll learn to mind her own business now I bet. I'd also bet, when SHE'S telling the story, people tell her SHE was being an ah.", "YTA. Showing your genital's to another person with out their consent is not cool, regardless of the circumstances.", "Yeah, YTA.  She shouldn't have acted the way she did, but not only did you flash her without consent, but it proved nothing.  Trans women also have vulvas.", "So what if you were operated?\n\nNext you show em a pic of ur uterus?", "Legally speaking, you committed a form of sexual assault.\n\nBut the legality of something is not the question here, and morally speaking in this case I don't believe you did anything wrong.\n\nThis person was bullying and insulting you with regards to your gender and appearance, and it was clear she wasn't going to accept your answer at face value or stop her mission to get you to admit you were trans. So you resorted to pretty much the only definitive way to prove your answer and end this once and for all.\n\nI see this like the person who goes around squaring up to people and asking for a fight crying when they finally get punched.\n\nAnd I would also see you being perfectly justified in reporting her for bullying...\n\nSo NTA", "For context, this is considered illegal. So, I think that is explanation enough.", "Next time this comes up, do a bit of silly research first.  Go find a cis male and look at how your arms move.

It freakin\u2019 sucks that they should feel the need to do that as a way to possibly protect themselves from harassment. Carrying them around in case anyone suddenly needs one is an awesome solidarity move, though. I actually used to know a guy who carried a bunch of tampons with him, more so because he got bad nose bleeds on occasion, but I know more than one girl who asked him for one lol. \n\nHowever, in this case, the jerkass who was pushing such a wildly out of bounds issue might possibly have been convinced by seeing menstrual products on hand, so I would personally still recommend that method before going for voluntary self-depantsing. I don\u2019t think OP is bad though. I just think they turned the dial up to 11 before trying a more moderate 5. Unfortunately some people won\u2019t listen to anything below a 10. God, the world just keeps being a disappointment when it comes to trans acceptance, but also accepting that behavioural and physical traits are not open to scrutiny to determine a person\u2019s AGAB.
