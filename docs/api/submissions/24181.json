My voice is also a bit deeper than others my age. I am also part of a group that organises camps for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAnyways, I went on one of these camps a few days ago and our group consisted of about 40 people. In the beginning we were asked to introduce ourselves and if you wanted, you could state what part of the LGBTQ+ community you were. When it was my turn, I said my name and that I'm a lesbian, and that was that.\nLater that day we got divided into groups for rooms, and I shared a room with 3 others.\nWhile making our beds, one of them asked if I was only a lesbian and nothing else. I said yes and she shrugged. I brushed this off since I thought she was just curious.\nBut the next evening, after all our activities, we got some free time before we had to sleep. Our other roommates were out to do something (I forgot what) and only me and that one girl were left.\nShe asked the same question, and once again I replied that I'm only lesbian. I also asked why she keeps asking me. And then she said 'I see right through you.' Confused, I asked what she meant and she said 'I can tell that you're transgender'. This really took me off guard and I said I wasn't. She said I could be honest with her and that she wouldn't tell anyone, but that it was very obvious to her.\nOnce again, I tell her I'm not. I also ask why she would think that. \nShe says she can tell by my face, the way how it's built and how I have a deeper voice than a normal girl my age. This pisses me off, as at one point I was very insecure about these things due to people thinking I was a man in the past when I had shorter hair. Pissed off, I tell her she's wrong and she shrugs, smiling. She starts saying how she doesn't judge and without thinking, I pull down my pants and ask if this proves enough. She looks shocked and runs out the room.\nI felt bad for acting so impulsively but yeah. She went to a counselor and I had to have a talk with them. I ended up getting suspended from the camp.\nSo, AITA? Obviously there's nothing wrong with being transgender, but as I'm not I didn't want to be seen like I am as again I had been insecure about being 'too masculine' in the past. I feel a bit guilty but I felt like at that moment I had no other choice.\nEDIT: The girl was also 18, I didn't flash a minor (should've specified this earlier)", "created_utc": 1691491548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lem1o/aita_for_unsolicitedly_showing_my_private_parts/", "score": 813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don\u2019t actually have any malice or hate in them when it happens.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like about the lgbt community doing it is because they KNOW BETTER.

I think it\u2019s dumb that we are going around ASKING pronouns when we meet people.\n\nThe idea of asking is to show openness and respect, which for a lot of trans folk out there, is currently a very crucial lifeline.\n\n>What I don\u2019t like about the lgbt community doing it is because they KNOW BETTER. Like I said, we spent a long time trying to do away with gender conformity.\n\n\u2026do away with gender conformity, but the \u201chandful\u201d of people whose pronouns are not obvious should bear the burden of telling people, rather than the community as a whole embracing the fact that gender presentation does not equal gender identity?

Everything above confirms that as a cisgender person, you are angered by having to specify being cisgender, which is usually how ignorant or, worse, bigoted people who are part of the \u201cnorm\u201d - the men, the straights, the whites, etc. - react when that \u201cnorm\u201d is challenged. \n\nAnd as part of a community who is fighting _really_ hard right now all over the world to ensure you continue to have the _right_ to be gender non-conforming, _you should know better_.", "If you assume that someone MIGHT be something\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make it much of an assumption, does it?", "I think the way the voting is going should make you question whether you actually have your finger on the pulse of morality as well as you seem to think.", "Flashing someone is never defending oneself.

You must have missed when I said \"to each their own if it makes them happy\"  I guess that interfered with your desperate need to be perpetually indignant at all times. Have fun being miserable your entire life. And just for the record, when people don't like you, it has nothing to do with bigotry, it's because you're an asshole. I can't help but notice, you *still* couldn't say why someone without a uterus would need menstrual products. And you know what, it's actually really offensive to reduce women to just our bodily functions. So women who have had hysterectomies arent real women? Same goes for post menopausal women too? Sounds like *you* are the bigoted one lmao.", "You\u2019re very good at misconstruing words but I don\u2019t think you realize you\u2019re doing it.\n\nYes I said IF people are going to do it.  I already told you, my preference is that they don\u2019t ask at all.  But, the fact that I\u2019ve seen discrimination with respects to who is asked has nothing to do with my preference that people just don\u2019t ask unless they\u2019re really stuck on what to refer to someone as.  So, no to your first paragraph.  Because your reading comprehension sucks lol.\n\nParagraph 2.  Yes, I do think it\u2019s slightly unreasonable.  In an actual lgbtq space, sure, maybe have people ask, whatever, since that is the type of space where you are actually likely to get deviances.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly like if someone came up to me and said \u201chi my name is Richard\u201d and I said back \u201cis it dick? Ricky? Rich? Rick?\u201d\n\nNo.  If Richard wants me to call him something he\u2019s going to say \u201chey my name is Richard, call me Rick\u201d\n\nAnd all your other points, yes, bring it down to statistics and you probably won\u2019t assume wrong.\n\nAnd yes, sorry to say, but humans have developed a knack for knowing how to differentiate between the sexes.  And again, 99.95% of people prefer the pronouns that match the sex that is usually easy to tell.  Despite OP saying she looks somewhat androgynous, I\u2019m betting her voice is a dead give away.  And with so much trans stuff all over social media and the news, I think people are thinking there\u2019s more than there really is and it\u2019s throwing people off.\n\nIf I see someone and I recognize that they are male\u2026 but it appears that they are on hormones and / or are conforming to stereotypically feminine appearances, then I\u2019ll go ahead and use she.  Not because *I* believe in those stereotypes of women, but because I\u2019m being nice and respectful to someone who is wanting to appear that way.\n\nDon\u2019t make 99.95% of the population change their entire language structure and MOSTLY CORRECT social instincts for such a small portion of people.  Trans people deserve basic human rights and a lack of discrimination like anyone else, anything else is just being extra needy.  THATS why so many people who say \u201cI honestly don\u2019t have a problem with trans people\u201d say that, but then put up a fight about this shit. They don\u2019t hate trans people.  They hate entitlement.\n\nJust stop.\n\nEditing just to say maybe before you continue this debate, maybe actually look at the upvotes and downvotes\u2026", "Again, I think reasonable minds can disagree on this. I don\u2019t think she reacted in the best way she could. And it wasn\u2019t necessarily illegal"]}
