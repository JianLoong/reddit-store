I breastfeed and they don't even offer to get mye a snack or water or anything like that. And they want me to somehow pump to create a milk stash. \n2) I feel like I could be the asshole because my partner does work 40 hrs at least every week and they are more supportive than other people I have heard of in parental roles.

I read this on Reddit once and it perfectly sums it up for a lot of situations like this; if what you're doing isn't work then they should be able to do it on evenings and weekends without a problem. If it is work then you are working 24/7 and need a break! Ask them which is it because either way they should be helping out more.", "NTA, but given that neither of you feel like you get a break, you should discuss that. If you both need a regular break from the kids, or each other, or everyone, then work out a way to make that happen between you. \n\nMaybe that means having a sitter once a month, or you taking the kids out somewhere regularly but them taking care of the kids some nights too.  \n\nMaybe there's other, better solutions - but you need to talk about them and figure out what you all need, and keep talking about whether it's working for you.", "NTA a child gives zero fucks about people's schedules. You are both parents and they should be helping too. Maybe open up a communication of how you're both feeling.", "NTA. If he sees this like a job for you then he should be fair. On the hours you're both \"not working\" you should split the workload. You're not his maid and don't have to do everything 24/7 because he works a 9-5.", "NTA. Being a SAHM in this day and age in labor would cost over 100k which I\u2019m sure his call center job is not giving him ( not a knock on call centers it\u2019s just usually a mill and doesn\u2019t pay well). It is domestic labor and you carry the mental load a lot more. Personally I would suggest you both sit down and watch the Amazon prime documentary FairPlay. I think you both will get A LOT from it.", "Hey so things change once you have a child. My relationship with my sons father completely altered cause I realized he was fucking useless and did not care about anything except himself. It was extremely hard to not be resentful, especially after already having a baby,giving birth, and then having to take care of my son every day by myself (while unbeknownst to me, my partner was out just partying and smoking and doing whatever he damn well pleased )it\u2019s very difficult to not start to resent someone that will not help you.  It was like pulling teeth to get him to do anything. I snapped cause our priorities were not the same so I decided it wasn\u2019t good enough and left. You are at home doing everything including shopping? It sounds like you do not have a support system. You need to sit down and talk to your partner again. NTA, for now - however, you need to stand up for yourself and your child. You and your child deserve more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A full time job is tiring, I understand the need to have a break after work, but being a SAHM can be just as tiring as a full time job. Even though you\u2019re not bringing an income you still can be on your feet all day, putting in hard physical and emotional labour. \nTo your partner it may feel unfair that they don\u2019t get as much free time as before, but they signed up for that when you two decided to have a child. the point of raising a child with a partner is that you support each other physically, emotionally, financially, with the kids, with homemaking, ect. You have a 6 month old child, you\u2019re both meant to be tired out of your minds and slightly going crazy\u2026 that\u2019s just how the early stages of childcare work. 40 hours a week isn\u2019t enough to justify a opting out of raising a human being on your time off (i know they\u2019re not completely opting out but you know what i mean).", "That's what I thought, we embarked on this journey together and I know it's hard but I never get an actual break. There's always something more I have to do and am responsible for.", "Thank you for the advice. I will definitely bring up those ideas when we talk about it next. I'm exhausted. And I know that no matter what I have to get up at night with our child because I breast feed but it would be nice to have moral support at least on the weekends. Or since I do pump if they would handle a night or two every once in a while so I could get some uninterrupted sleep for once.", "I have tried to do that and nothing really changed. I explained that I was feeling alone, and overwhelmed because of how much responsibility I've been crying and that I honestly never get a break. We've gone out maybe two times with out our child but even then I still have to make all the decisions. My partner has been able to got out with friends a few times without me or our child. And I haven't gotten the chance once.", "I just want support and an hour break every couple days.  Being a SAHM is already demanding and on top of that I breastfeed so I'm basically chained to our child 24/7.", "I've never heard of the documentary. I will definitely give it a watch. Thank you for the suggestion.", "I wish it could be truly 50/50 but I breast feed and my partner absolutely cannot step in for that and our child refuses formula.", "Being a SAHM is exhausting. And my partner makes it out to be that their job is more exhausting. But I never get a real break", "If you pump there\u2019s no reason whatsoever for your partner never to take over. Being a SAHM doesn\u2019t mean you\u2018re the designated 24/7 service while they work 8 hours a day, help out with a few little things like staying home with the kid while you\u2019re doing *yet another chore*, but get uninterrupted sleep all the time and additional time off. That\u2019s not how a partnership works.\n\nEdit: Forgot the judgment because I\u2019m so mad on your behalf. NTA. Your partner needs to get a grip.", "I've been sahm with three for a decade. My husband got up first, changed the baby then passed them to me for feeding. He went back to sleep sometimes, and others he would make sure I stayed awake during the feed (on particularly hard nights) because being super tired and getting hit with the hormone wash from feeding was exhausting. Your partner needs to step up! This is their child too and they need to start acting like it.", "That sounds very hard. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.", "The other parent also could change a diaper more or cook. If they would want to, they would do it.", "Yeah it kinda seems like calessness or a lack of appreciation for everything that I take care of. \n\nBut I almost feel mean for saying that.", "INFO: you mentioned room mate in there\u2026 was that a typo or what? \n\nProvisionally, NTA, you have a child together then you sharing looking after that child 50/50.", "NTA. Your partner is also a parent.", "You are not mean at all bc it absolutely is a carelessness"]}
