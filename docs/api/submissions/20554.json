We always wished we could have had more kids, but due to medical complications that I won't go into, we only had our girl. Because of that we've always dreamed of being grandparents, so we made long-term investments that paid off, and now we have almost $350K saved up to help raise our future grandkids and cover their college expenses.\n\nI want to make it clear that we never pressured our daughter to have children in any way. She simply knows that the money is there and what it's intended for. I'll explain why this is relevant later on.\n\nThe thing is, our daughter recently made the decision not to have kids. She told us a few months ago and even had a tubal ligation soon after. We were both a bit shocked and asked if she was sure, but we also reassured her that we'll always be there for her.\n\nI won't lie, I'm really disappointed, but not in our daughter. It's her life, and it's not our place to impose anything on her. My disappointment stems from the fact that I won't have grandkids. However, if this is what makes her happy, I have no right to say anything about it.\n\nLast week, we had a lunch at our house with our daughter, and she brought up the topic of the money we had saved for our future grandkids. We simply told her that we will make use of it differently now. For example, I'll be able to work fewer hours before retirement, and we plan to use the money for travel.\n\nAt that moment, our daughter's expression changed, and she fell silent. When my wife asked if she was okay, she suddenly exploded, accusing us of punishing her for not having kids and taking away the money that she would have used if she had children. The situation became really tense, and she stormed out after the argument.\n\nNow she's not speaking to us and has posted about it on social media. We've also received some unpleasant messages from our daughter's friends, expressing their disapproval of our actions.\n\nLet me be clear, we haven't disowned her. She will still receive whatever money or properties we have when we pass away. However, we saved that money specifically to support our future grandkids, and now that we know we won't have any, we decided to use it for our own purposes. Is that wrong?

I also want to address some of the questions I've seen in the comments:\n\n* \rNo, our daughter is not facing financial trouble. She has a well-paying job, not extraordinarily high, but a good amount for our area. Moreover, we are confident about this because when she bought her house, we were able to loan her half of the purchase price interest-free. She could tell us at any time that she can't pay us back for a certain period, and we wouldn't be concerned about it.\n* She doesn't have student loans. She received a partial scholarship, and we helped her with the remaining expenses. We always supported our daughter when she needed it.\r\n* We may have mentioned at some point that we would like to have grandkids, although I can't recall the exact time or context because it's not a subject that we actively pursue with her. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that she is the master of her own life, and we have no right to impose anything on her. We have always supported her and made it clear that her life belongs to her, and nobody has the authority to dictate anything to her.\r\n* We brought up the topic of money some time ago because we understand how challenging it can be to raise children, especially considering the financial costs involved. We saw it as a way to ensure that she could consider having kid(s) without feeling alone in that journey.\r\n* The money we provided was primarily intended for college expenses, although not exclusively. If the child(ren) need anything while growing up, the funds could be used for that purpose as well.\r\n* She underwent the procedure, and we were there with her during the recovery process at the hospital.", "Info\n\nI can't say why, but it feels for me like something is missing.\n\nYou say, you told her you saved up money for her children.\n\nHow did you tell her?\n\n\"I only got you a McDonalds voucher for your birthday, but I put 1000 $ in a savings account for your children\" would be a legimate reason to be angry.\n\nI mean, if you didn't get her nice gifts or didn't pay for her college by telling her, that you put money in the savings account of her future children, you basically saved on her for this money and now you spend it on yourself.\n\nBut I don't say you did this.

Travel and maybe early / easier retirement sound perfect.\n\nSo you know where I'm coming from - I also chose not to have kids, and am estranged from my parents.

You essentially put your dreams of many kids upon your daughter's shoulders. Without considering her dreams might be different.

I know I got lucky with the timeline, but there are plenty of doctors that are willing, and lists of said doctors online.", "that's actually not true, tons of doctors do them now that abortion is illegal", " It\u2019s pretty painful to hear that you aren\u2019t enough for your parents in your own right,,", "Exactly!", "I also suspect some sort of communication breakdown or missing info in the post. I'm about the same age too and my parents have known for years that I'm not having children. It's not usually a decision you make suddenly so why was OP shocked by this new information? \n\nIn addition, could the daughter have a reason why she might reasonably have expected to receive some of the money? For example, does she have a lot of debt (university, medical), or is she struggling to afford housing? Did she think that some of the money would have helped to pay for her living costs in the event that she had children?", "TBF, the taxpayer money is rent money paid for use of the crown lands, and the UK taxpayer makes far more off of the crown lands than they pay to the Royal family for use of those lands.", "But seriously speaking.. who would ever hire them for any actual job / position?", "He had the \u00a330 million his mother left him.

One trained in carpentry/cabinet joinery and had a very successful independent career.\n\nThere was nothing to stop Harry doing the same. He can still do this.\n\nWorking royals do get paid, plus expenses. Because the monarch pays instead of a company, that doesn't' make it any less of a job. Being a working royal is a lot of hard work, and long days.\n\nHarry has received millions of pounds from his dad, and many millions more in inheritances. He has millions more still due, held in trust \n\nAll that money is plenty to allow him to live comfortably.\n\nOther royals live well on much less money.\n\nThe problem is that Harry seems to be blowing through his cash reserves like money grows on trees.", "It\u2019s really irrelevant to the post, though.", "Yup. I told my dad I\u2019d be mad if he chose to skip out on doing things while alive just to ensure he could leave me money.", "There\u2019s nothing in the post to suggest that the parents didn\u2019t support their daughter. She\u2019s the sole beneficiary of all other assets, this is just a specific fund created for the grandchildren", "What they fail to mention is all the people who regret having kids. And there are plenty. I have one and love being a mom but just because being a parent is right for me or right for another person does not mean it's right for everyone and for MANY people it goes even beyond that and is actually a terrible idea.", "Thank you for saying this\u2026 I\u2019m at that critical \u201churry up\u201d age and that one comment does seem to get at me.. Thank you for giving me insight from \u201cthe other side\u201d! I needed it!", "All these AITA stories have random people sending messages on the side of the person the poster is having a problem with. I would love to see a deep dive into that. In my whole real- life I have never heard of anyone sending a mean text message to support a friend who is in a fight that they are not in the least bit involved in. I don't think I know anyone who would change their mind because their coworkers college roommate texted them. \n\n\n\nWho are these people? Do they send out messages any time someone they know gets into a fight? Does it ever work? Doesn't putting yourself into someone else's drama get exhausting?", "My friend went through that 30 years ago, when she was 24, she already had 3 kids, and she was having her period for 3 weeks out of 4, and she had to be put on iron pills because she was losing so much blood. She wanted a hysterectomy, and no one would do it. It took her being hospitalized before she could get it done.", "22 can conform I'm debating on having ny bf come with me to tell them he don't want kids either", "When I had a tubal ligation in 1985, I had 2 kids.  My OB gynecologist had me write a handwritten note saying that I understood that the surgery meant that I wouldn't be able to have more children.\n\nSo far OK.  Then came the part where my husband had to sign, too.\n\nMeanwhile, a friend of mine at the same time wanted to be childfree.  She had to look around for a doctor willingly to do the procedure on a childless woman.  The one she found required her to be at least 30 years old, so as soon as she turned 30, she had it done.", "i just commented above, but yeah my bestfriend went through the same and had to lie that she was married and her husband didn't want more children. It's so fucking weird and both dystopian and ancient, that we have no control of our own bodies and need permission from men to get medical procedures. However she also got her boobs done and the doctor had no problem with that. Im very grateful for my dad, who recognized male ownership, and with my mom, decided to give me a weird made up last name, because he didn't want me to feel owned by a man, then passed to another man if I get married. I know that's not standard, and also think family ties are important, but the idea of a woman changing her identity and becoming her husbands property, in a way, is kind of wild.", "Wth?  My mother had to get permission from my dad to get a tubiligation. That was over 45 years ago. She had 6 of us and he was abusive and kept the money for whatever he wanted. It was hell magnified by having so many kids.", "I was told the same. I\u2019m now 36, single, childfree by choice. I struggle with my period and have been asking different doctors in different countries for a hysterectomy since I was 24 years old. \u201eWhat if you meet a man who wants children?\u201c well, he can duck off because I still don\u2019t want any, thank you very much!", "What's it it called? I would like to use it", "Plus they\u2019re wealthy. She can afford to doctor shop.", "I have a list in my Google drive if anyone needs it. Just a heads up.", "Many more doctors are willing to do it since Dobbs, too. They know that if people have family histories of high risk pregnancies and don't want to chance there being no medical care in the case of complications, this is now their only recourse.", "Same. If you have the internet, it is even easier to find someone to support you if your doctor won't.", "This made me feel so angry for you, I almost downvoted your comment. I\u2019m so sorry you went through That and hope your recovery has been much better since then", "In trust, couldn\u2019t touch it.", "This is factually untrue and also irrelevant of the point that his family rescidended all support financial or otherwise when he married someone they didn't approve of who outed their internal racism and prejudices in front of the world.", "When my brother got divorced, his ex told a lot of lies to her friends and family. (They both had issues but she made him out to be the devil.) He got calls and texts from her family and friends, some of them even threatening. I think people see it as defending the people they care about, but it\u2019s all sorts of crazy.", "Small town maybe? When my partner and I had issues with my mil, a surprising number of people were convinced they had the right to interfere. It was disappointing to say the least.", "It feels majorly middle school to me. Like... Yeah, I remember shit like that happening when I was in school! It wasn't unheard of to get a random message from the \"out of school friend\" of someone you beefed with, who hated you, who crushed on you, etc. You were generally shocked if it was an actual person and not a sock account/number faker. I made friends with someone like this once as a preteen. It happened less in high school, and even less after, until this just stopped being a thing I could fathom anyone doing. I think the last time someone's flying monkeys showed up in my DMs, I was 19 and even then thought it was wild and immature. I can imagine it might happen to people who use social media more than me, simply because it makes it easier to find friends of friends to harass and apparently people forget they're dealing with real people on the internet but... To me, it just sounds very middle school.", "I am so thankful my doctor actually offered the service for free when I had my second kid by c-sect. She said since she was in there anyway she could do it at the same time. I agreed but asked that she clip my tubes rather than cutting them. Clipping meant I could possibly have the procedure reversed if I changed my mind, because I was only 22 at the time. I am not sure if they even do the clipping procedure anymore, I haven't heard of it in years. But at any rate I never wanted to have it reversed. To be honest I never wanted kids, but loved my own very much once I had them. I just am not a fan of other kids in general.", "A close friend and her husband knew they were CF for yyyeeaaarrsss. She started having medical issues and even WITH her husband supporting her wish for a hysterectomy (starting early to mid 30s), her doctors made her wait till she was almost 40\u2026\u2026.", "Happened to my mom and she had 4 of us and a tubal ligation. All but one of us kids were adults at the time, the hold out was 17.", "Still gonna be a tough road. I totally respect your decision and stand with you to make it. But at 22, they are all going to say you're too young. \ud83e\udd2c \n\nI'm so sorry for what hurdles you'll have to jump to do what *you* want to *your* body.", "Thank you yes indeed. I never had the problem again and no more blood streaked sheets from incessant scratching. It was nearly 30 years ago but will never regret getting it done. Just wish I had another surgeon do it.  I considered getting fixed back then too due to haemorrhaging problems but rather than fight the battle I just took the strongest pill available, with no breaks from aged 14 till late 40s when doctor insisted I stop due to my age and family breast cancer. I warned him of the consequences and even had an abulation that didn't work so poor hubby was in charge of the murder scene every month made by me getting from the loo to the shower. Luckily menopause put an end to my torment.", "Nope, it's not untrue. And his financial support was rescinded a YEAR after he left claiming to want to be financially independent. A 36 year old man with a \u00a330 million trust fund! I'll say it again, save your pity. \nFYI - He's since publicly stated his family aren't racist, claiming that to be a lie the press made up.", "They don't even just cut them anymore. They do a full tube removal because \"tying\" and \"cutting\" has a high self-reversal rate", "Ik that what they say I'm in Alabama so it's worst but I don't like kids and cry when they scream but yes let's force me to have a child..", "5 seconds on Google would have told u his trust fund was never 30 million. Financial support was also rescinded 10days after he announced he was stepping back from his royal duties, again 5 seconds on Google to debunk your false claim.", "NW Alabama, here.
