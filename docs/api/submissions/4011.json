Some kind of protein like chicken (they sell pre-cooked chicken breast strips, or get a rotisserie chicken) or salmon (they sell precooked salmon filets too) or chickpeas. Cheese maybe. Dressing. \n\n5) tacos/quesadillas/burritos. Literally any meat -- brown ground beef and add the taco seasoning packet, buy some frozen fried shrimp, use some of that rotisserie chicken, whatever.
