He comes from a low income background and his parents have always struggled for money, so ever since he went in, I have been supporting him financially, working two jobs and going into debt. He owes a small amount of restitution for his crime, which means out of any money deposited in his commissary account, 70% gets automatically taken away to pay for it. So basically for every $100 I send he gets $30.\n\nHe is expecting his stimulus check, which would cover the full amount of restitution that he owes, but his mom has asked him to give it to her as they are several months behind on rent and she is worried about losing the house.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling him he should not give it to her? If his restitution was paid off, it would ease a huge financial burden off me since I wouldn\u2019t have to send in x3 the money that he needs. I understand she\u2019s struggling, but she was never a good parent, and her getting that check would cost ME thousands more dollars down the line.\n\nETA: Thanks everyone for your advice. Upon reflection, it does feel like his mom is trying to take advantage of me. She has asked me for money several times in the last few months (which I have said no to) even though she knows I am already struggling to pay off my CC debt from helping out her son. I offered to help her set up a savings account but she never took me up on it. She just wants a handout. If my bf does end up giving her the check, I will have to support him emotionally but not financially, because I never signed up to support an entire family.", "created_utc": 1675244930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qpje1/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_out_my_mil/", "score": 966, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But kinda for paying your bfs restitution. Why put that on yourself? You didn't do the crime. He did. You two aren't married so you are not accountable for it. I'm more concerned about that than his mother tbh. You are struggling, taking two jobs, and paying for what sounds like a loser (sorry, not sorry).", "Is he worth it? Going into debt, paying his bills, supporting his family? If you told me he was your husband and you had kids with the guy, sure. \n\nAnyway...if this is the life you're choosing, then I'd go with giving his mum the cheque. Why? Because if she loses the house...guess who becomes a bigger burden? She does.", "NTA. Let me be 100% clear on this. It's *his* check. It needs to go towards *his* debt. If he has the funds to pay his restitution, then *that is the first thing that needs to be paid*. There *is* no stimulus check. That money has already been spent. By your partner. Who is *in prison*, leaving you to provide for everyone, including his family.\n\nIt's a horrendous thing, but poverty/low income, begets poverty/low income. Those who have a little give it to those with none, and when those with none get a little, they give it to others with none. An endless cycle where those who climb out are seen as selfish because they won't give.\n\nDo not join the cycle. Do whatever you need to do for you. If your bf wanted to take care of his mother *he should have made sure he was around to take care of her and not leaching off you and making you party to his punishment*. It sucks so much, but if your MIL ends up homeless? That is *not* your fault.\n\nWatch out though. If your bf thinks you made his mother homeless and blames you for this, he might rely on you for money and dump you once he's out for his \"mummy\". He's not around. Look out for you, none of them will.", "NTA. Don't ever go into debt in order to prevent OTHER people from going into debt.", "NTA. But let's be serious. Drop the dude. You are putting yourself into debt.", "NTA Maybe I'm even more selfish than you, but I don't see why you are taking on all this financial burden. Maybe if you were 47 and had children with this man, I could understand why you feel responsible for his debts. Or if he was using it as you expected to pay off his debt so he can have a clean start and build a future with you. But he's a criminal, and his mother should figure out her own solutions rather than expecting you to support her. \n\nYou don't need to take on this financial burden. If he's sending your money to his mother, you don't have any guarantee that this is for your future together as a couple, so maybe you need to put your own financial security first.", "OP you are holding some good cards here. Time to play them.\n\nGuessing that YOU are the only reason your man's commissary has been funded -- your work, your support. It costs you a buck to get 30 cents into his hands. Like it or not, you've INVESTED in feeding him AND chipping away at his restitution. Without you, he'd have nothing and would have made no progress, because nobody else is paying in, right?\n\nAnd you've gone into DEBT doing this, right? \n\nNow there's a chance for you two to get out from under that crippling 70% toll, and get his restitution paid off with his own money. So that if you help him with commissary in future, 100% of what you send actually gets into his hands. Massive improvement!\n\nBut his mama knows about that cheque, somehow, and wants it for her household. Because she's in DEBT too, she says.\n\nMeantime YOU just do not know:\n\n* whether that household is actually behind in rent, utilities or whatever\n* WHY they're behind (like, what has their money been spent on? commissary for Sonny, I think not)\n* what efforts every person in that household has made, to pay their rent, manage their money, and not get evicted\n* what benefits or resources are available to that household that haven't yet been tapped (like...what are they doing with THEIR stimulus cheques?)\n\nYou know NONE of this information. Bet your man doesn't either. So you can't decide if this is a case of true need greater than your own, or a brazen shakedown.\n\nIf they're gonna use you two as a Bank, they need to provide full and truthful disclosure of all their finances. Do you think that's likely to happen, OP?

How much is it?", "NTA tbh. But you may wanna stay off the subject and see what he decides to do, and you get to decide from there if he's worth the trouble too.", "NAH For voicing opinion but his money and he can do what he wants.  Perhaps stop supporting him with commissary to the detriment of your own life and paying his restitution.", "ESH. The only thing you control is how much money you give your boyfriend.

Your best move would be to stop sending money  & see what happens to your relationship then.

Now I, an adult, will tell you what to do with yours. Ironic. \n\nStop paying his legal and moral obligation for restitution. How in the world will he have any consequences if you make restitution? \n\nIf I may say so, funding his commissary account is second priority behind YOUR financial security. Two jobs and you\u2019re still going in debt? He gets \u201cthree hots and a cot\u201d by law. He doesn\u2019t need your money.

This is putting you under financial stress.  He now has the money to pay it back himself.  Therefore you no longer will pay for it. If he wants to help his mother, he should be the one to suffer the consequences of it, not you.   Otherwise of course he is going to help his mother, he won't be loosing anything. \n\nCalculate how much commissary he would need each week if there was no restitution, and say you will pay that.

That's just math, not in any way an emotional issue. \n\nIf his mother is behind on rent, one check isn't going to fix the situation. It is what we call \"throwing good money after bad.\" For example, if my friend lost their job and is starting a new one next month so is short on cash, I'm happy to pay their rent, because next month they will be good to go. If my friend simply cannot afford their rent on their salary, then me paying their rent one month only delays the problem, because next month they will be in the same position. The check is wasted on his mother, who will still be financially strapped with no long term solutions. \n\nTell your boyfriend very kindly that you cannot keep financially supporting him in this way, and the reason you had been is because it was supposed to be short term, until the check came to clear his debt. That you have already done enough for him, and that you cannot do more, so it is his choice what he does with the check, but you can't contribute the way you have been. \n\nAnd then, get your own finances together.
