We lost our parents when we were little. We had half siblings who were much older but were not part of our lives. Our dad had a complicated family dynamic where nobody spoke to each other in his family and my mom's family was either gone or just not interested (really only my half siblings). Skye was everything to me while I had him. He was there to protect me and defend me when needed. He was my best friend. He was my only family for so long. When I lost him it broke me.

But last weekend when the shower came around, they were very vocal about their hatred of the name. My husband's sister said the name was a girly name and how awful it was to that to a boy. While his parents said things like we're crazy for thinking it was a good name and his mom said she didn't know where I got it but she was hoping I would return the name and buy a better one before he arrives because he will grow to wonder if we cared for him at all or if we saw him as a joke or a doll. My husband was furious. I started to cry because they knew the story behind the name and they were saying so many awful things. My husband encouraged me to get out of there while he stayed and yelled at his family. I did leave.\n\nThey were angry with me then for leaving and even thought my husband defended me and said he told me to leave, I wonder if I was rude leaving when people were there to celebrate our little boy?\n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to clarify we are naming our son Skye, not Skyler.

I\u2019m sorry they made fun of your name and I\u2019m so, so sorry you lost your brother. Skye is a perfectly fine name.

Seriously.", "NTA. In its original spelling, Schuyler, it's Dutch for scholar and it was historically more common for boys than for girls. His family is showing their ignorance. Besides, even if they hate the name, mocking you for it at your baby shower was disgusting and rude.", "Absolutely NTA. That\u2019s horrible and I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with their bs. Definitely talk with your husband about setting boundaries before baby boy is born and for after he\u2019s born, as they give me the overbearing, bulldozing in laws type of vibes if they\u2019re already being rude when you\u2019re still pregnant all over his name. His name is lovely, and I think it\u2019s great your honoring someone you were so close to, and the only two people whose opinions matter are you and hubby.", "NTA his parents are definitely assholes and it's disgusting they acted like that to you", "NTA, you were not rude and they do not deserve your concern nor your respect, they obviously were not there to celebrate your little boy and barring change of behavior and apologies they do not deserve to be part of his life", "NTA\n\nYou weren't the AH for leaving, just as you wouldn't have been the AH if the shower was at your own house and you threw them out.  There's something fundamentally wrong with people who throw a party for someone then proceed to insult them and make them cry.  \n\nI've always thought Skylar is a beautiful name and it doesn't matter if it has a deep meaning or if its something you got off the back of a cereal packet.  He's your baby and only you and your husband have a say in the name.\n\nI would watch out for your in-laws creating some sort of pet name for your son to use instead of  the one you chose.  My mum was named after her gran but when her gran found out she was horrified and proceeded to call her by the name she preferred.  Henceforth my mum was known as this name for the next 88 years of her life rather than the name on her birth certificate (although to be fair, gran was right in this case).", "NTA. They weren't celebrating your little boy, they were criticizing your choice and being mean about it.", "Absolutely NTA - what a bunch of heartless AHs your in-laws are! Especially the comment about returning the name and buying a better one... WTF?!\n\nI'm sure I've read a thread on this sub before where in-laws/family members didn't like the name a baby was given so called them by a different name. I hope your in-laws won't try something like this.\n\nIf they won't accept your sons name then I strongly suggest you go low/no contact. Sadly you can't return your in-laws in exchange for better human beings, but you don't have to have anything to do with them", "1) NTA for leaving on the grounds that they were rude about the name choice on its own grounds alone, dismissive of the thought and care that you both clearly put into it (hubby is a keeper) and very disrespectful of the memory of your brother and the love you still hold for him.\n\n2) personally I admire the historical / familial links to the name.  My 2/f middle name is my (dead) mother's first name. My 4 week old nephew's middle name is Aidan, an anagram of his maternal grandmother's name which was Diana. You two stick to your guns.\n\n3) There are plenty of unisex names and Skyler - whilst an uncommon one - is no exception. My wife and I (I'm male) have the exact same name ( like Mr and Mrs Sam Smith or Mr and Mrs Jo Jones).  Skyler is not exclusively female.\n\n4) You could maybe point them towards noted male Skyler's. Wikipedia (bless it's soul) throws up 12 male Skyler's including a few soccer players, some footballer players and if they're American and republicans then twist the knife hard with the information that Skyler Wheeler is a republican member of the Iowa house of representatives so they can go suck it.  If that is insufficient, go hard and twist the knife with the info that the 17th VP of the USA was a Schuyler Colfax which is these days more commonly spelt your way.  \n\nRespect to your hubby for helping you to step out of the toxic environment but then staying in it to defend you.  Major lad points for him.  Keeper on those grounds too.", "Nta. You picked a beautiful name that had real thought and meaning behind it. If your in laws can't accept that, then they don't need be apart of baby skye's life! My wife is pregnant with a baby boy too and she wants to name him for her grandpa, whom we lost in 2019. I already think you too are off to a good start as parents. Your husband being willing to stand up to his family is awesome, you married a good one, op!", "NTA you and your husband are the parents. Therefore you two are the only ones who get a say in the name. If his family doesn\u2019t like it, too bad, they don\u2019t have to. Plus I feel they went overboard with their comments. It\u2019d be bad enough if they just said they don\u2019t like it, but they double down and kept going with their comments. His family sounds very rude and obnoxious.", "NTA. Nothing rude about leaving. A group of people making insults about a name that means something to you. Husband was right to tell you to leave. Be ready for the nicknames when he's born.", "NTA. Even without your history with the name, your in-laws were being rude beyond words. It would have been rude simply to say they didn't like the name even if they had left it at that, but for them to continue to insult the name and just *keep going* is just inexcusable.\n\nGood for your husband for defending both you and the name and calling out his family. I don't know if this kind of behavior is typical for them or if it came out of nowhere, but they owe you a **huge** apology, to the point where you should not let them see the child until not only they apologize to you, but they make you a solemn promise to never make fun of the name again. \n\nIn short, you are not the AH for walking out. In absolutely no case were you the one being rude.", "NTA. You are never obligated to let anyone mistreat you or your family - including your unborn child.

Your inlaws are unbelievably cruel, especially knowing your history and your connection with that name. I know guys named Skye (not Skylar) and they are the most grounded, wonderful men that you would ever meet. You and your husband were correct to leave and he was correct to yell at his family. If they don't like the name, they don't need to have interaction with your son. Congratulations on your pregnancy and your supportive husband. I am sorry that your inlaws are idiots.", "NTA. They did not behave as if they were celebrating your boy. Kudos to your husband for getting you out of there and dealing with his family. This is how it should be done.", "Definitely NTA. You're not supposed to make mommy-to-be cry at her baby shower. That was so mean and cold of them, especially knowing the deeply personal meaning the name had. \n\nI'm glad your husband defended you and gave them a piece of his mind. \n\nI'm sorry for your pain and losing your family so young. So glad you have a family of your own now.", "They were not celebrating they knew that it would hurt your feelings and they still did it they wanted to hurt and criticize you cut them off and say ur not speaking to them endless they oplogize keep the baby away from them and if they get more mad at you tell them what they did was awful and you won't forgive endless they act like they mean it I hope your first pregnancy is wonderful and that name is beautiful and so is the meaning don't cave because they absent minded and act like they can chose your baby's name\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Hello! I am really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve gone through so much. You are definitely NTA.

I hope you know that Skye is a very beautiful name and your brother is so proud and happy for you. I hope you also know that you are not powerless, this is your baby. You are allowed to set boundaries with anyone when it comes to your baby and are allowed to be upset when people insult the name you\u2019ve chosen. You are allowed to not want family around because they are toxic and because they hurt you. It seems like they have no respect for you if I\u2019m being honest. Even if I hated the name my family member chose for their kid, I would never outright insult them and berate them, ESPECIALLY when I know it means so much to them. I think you and your husband should talk about setting some boundaries around his family because they are mean and have berated you, and why would you want to hand YOUR baby to someone like that? I hope you find the solution that you are looking for and good luck!", "NTA \nWho cares if it's \"rude\" to leave a party where the hosts were beyond rude to you.

Poor OP.", "NTA!\n\nIf people are being rude to you the genuinely most adult thing you can do is go to another room.\n\nGood on your husband for sticking up for you, Skye is a beautiful name and it\u2019s a beautiful backstory.", "NTA at all. Skye is a beautiful, gender-neutral name and I think it\u2019s a beautiful way to honor your brother. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I wouldn't accept their gifts from the shower either. Positive vibes only for baby Skye.", "Big mom-hug. You're absolutely NTA for walking away from rude idiots and I'm very glad your husband stood up for you. \n\nYou keep that beautiful name with such a deep meaning, your little boy wil grow up proud to be named after his uncle.", "NTA. And really it is not their business. Sky is a beautiful name and it is a great way to remember your brother. Congrats on your son \ud83d\udc95", "nta", "NTA.\n\nDoes the name have a penis or a vagina? \n\nIf so, it's not for children. It's for adults only.  /s\n\nIf it doesn't, it's for both genders....because it doesn't have genitalia and therefore is neither. \n\nWords, names, colors, actives are not inherently gendered. Name him Sarah Susan Janey, put him in a pink tutu and sign him up for dance lessons. None of rhese things will make his penis turn into a vagina and in *any* way affect his gender. You know what does? X and Y chromosomes. That's it. \n\nYou are in the right to not be bullied by your family's outdated archaic gender stratification, nor should you be forced to put up with any insults on something so important just to keep the peace.", "Skye is a beautiful name for your Lil boy. Don't let the rude assholes change your mind! NTA", "NTA. Never participate in your own abuse.", "NTA but maybe you can have that as a middle name. Your son is his own person and maybe just dedicate that name to your brother as his middle name. I don\u2019t know how kids are in school with the bullying but yes everyone can agree Skye is a beautiful name but also a feminine sounding one.", "If I were to judge your husband off of one action, he's a good one. Don't even sweat it. NTA, by a longshot.", "NTA\n\nI played an online game and made many virtual friends - some of them I knew their real names and we were in contact outside the game. One of them was a young man called Skylar. He would be about 24 years old now.", "NTA!!!", "NTA - as said in previous comments, love your reason and meaning for such a special name to your soon to be son. happy to read your partner stood up for you as well. Fun fact: I live in Schuyler County NY.", "NTA. My in-laws AND my family hated the name for our daughter, who is also named after my husband's deceased sister. Once we explained the meaning they all shut their traps real quick.", "My sons name is Jordan Michael. My parents tried calling him Mike. I cut it off. He is Jordan. Girls are Jordan too. Same with Kyle, Sam, and plenty of other names.  Skye is a wonderful name for your son and he\u2019ll be proud to know it was his uncles name.  Your in laws are terrible for their attitude.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s family sound kind of terrible. Especially if they knew the history behind the name", "That\u2019s a beautiful name, and a lovely tribute to your brother. I\u2019m sure your baby will love that name.", "\u201cMy husband encouraged me to get out of there while he stayed and yelled at his family\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s a good man right there. Too many stories of people blind ti the assholery of their family and unwilling to confront it. \n\nNTA - they\u2019re monsters for this.", "A dear friend of mine (I am 65) was named Skye. He was a big, burly man who played the bagpipes. It is a traditional Scottish name for men. And it is a lovely name. Your story reminded me of him (he passed away last year).", "In so many posts on here you have in-laws insulting the OP and their spouse either doing nothing or joining it. It\u2019s refreshing that the husband actually stood up for OP here.

My grandparents didn\u2019t like the name my parents picked for my oldest sister and ohhh boyyyy did they make that known to everyone. My husband and I are expecting our first and refuse to tell anyone her name before she\u2019s born bc we aren\u2019t going to change it despite what opinions may be and it\u2019s much harder to be rude about a name when you\u2019re looking at the newborn when you find it out.", "There are a few cases where it is acceptable to intervene. Especially if the sound of the name together with the last name could be misinterpreted or I don't know a name associated with something bad like Adolf. Otherwise, I stand with you.", "U did well. Unless the name is something which is gonna be a huge problem for the kid in future, people should just shut up.", "I have a nephew with the same name as my abusive ex.  I have never said a word, and I never will.", "Sooo much harder to be rude about a name when you have a snuggly newborn to attach it to right away", "I saw someone named their baby Brockleigh the other day. Did they even try saying out aloud first?  \n\n\nSkye is a beautiful name.", "Yeah, the original full form is a boy name originally. But Skye as a name was more common for girls. Though certainly used as a nickname for boys and has been pretty unisex for a while now.", "NTA", ">You giving your first child your brothers name is going to leave him with shoes he will never be able to fill, and with trauma of being named after the brother that died when he was 17.\n\nUnless you have a crystal ball that tells you the future, this is crossing a line. \n\nThis might be the case for you or someone you know, but it's not right to project that onto someone else.  She might think of her brother, but there's no indication in her post that this is her way of replacing him. \n\nI recommend you watch an episode of Futurama: The Luck of the Fryrish.  Season 3, episode 4 iirc. \n\n>Though, I do agree with them, Skye as a name for a boy is super modern and pretty bad. I'd hate to have that name. \n\nThen don't name your kid Skye.  And don't change your name to Skye. \n\nWere you the bully in school that made fun of people's names?", "He will be his own person. I do not expect him to be my brother. But his name will have been chosen with so much love and I want that for him.", "It's not that I don't trust him. I do trust my husband. But he has always said I am hard on myself so that could be part of it.", "Wanting some additional confirmation isn't a bad thing. Sometimes, people just wanna know others agree with them . Doesn't mean they don't trust the people they already got advice from. Just means they want to know if most people agree with them.", "There was a guy maybe a week ago objecting to the family name of Charles because the last name was Manson. Yeah.\n\nThis is nothing like that and her ILs can get bent.", "I\u2019m unsure if this will bring any comfort but 1) skye is a beautiful name both for the memory it holds and for the images of blue skies, freedom and limitless possibilities it evokes. 2) I only know boy Skye\u2019s, I was surprised at the i distance that it was a girly name!", "My nephew's name is Skye, not Schuyler or Skyler, just Skye.  I didn't like it at first bc I thought it was a girl's name but once he was born and I met him, it fits him perfectly. It will fit your son perfectly as well and he will grow to love the meaning of it and why you named him that.  Don't let your inlaws dampen your joy over honoring your brother. Your son will always know how much you love him and your brother.", "NTA\n\nI braced myself for a tragediegh of a name, but you picked my favorite! \n\nYou both handled yourselves well.", "I went to high school with two guys who went by Sky. One was just named Sky, and the other one went by it because his middle name was Skylar and he did like his first name.", "I was named after a grandparent I never met. I have never felt pressured to live like them or be like them. I just always felt they were really loved and I was too.", "No, and you can see from my post history (which last time I made this exact same damn point I got some 2k upvotes or something) I'm being consistent whether I like the name or not.\n\nGiving a child the name of a deceased relative will make that kid always compare themselves to that relative. That's a pretty common reality.
