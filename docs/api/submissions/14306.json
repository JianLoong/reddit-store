We lost our parents when we were little. We had half siblings who were much older but were not part of our lives. Our dad had a complicated family dynamic where nobody spoke to each other in his family and my mom's family was either gone or just not interested (really only my half siblings). Skye was everything to me while I had him. He was there to protect me and defend me when needed. He was my best friend. He was my only family for so long. When I lost him it broke me.

But last weekend when the shower came around, they were very vocal about their hatred of the name. My husband's sister said the name was a girly name and how awful it was to that to a boy. While his parents said things like we're crazy for thinking it was a good name and his mom said she didn't know where I got it but she was hoping I would return the name and buy a better one before he arrives because he will grow to wonder if we cared for him at all or if we saw him as a joke or a doll. My husband was furious. I started to cry because they knew the story behind the name and they were saying so many awful things. My husband encouraged me to get out of there while he stayed and yelled at his family. I did leave.\n\nThey were angry with me then for leaving and even thought my husband defended me and said he told me to leave, I wonder if I was rude leaving when people were there to celebrate our little boy?\n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to clarify we are naming our son Skye, not Skyler.

I\u2019m sorry they made fun of your name and I\u2019m so, so sorry you lost your brother. Skye is a perfectly fine name.

Seriously.", "NTA. In its original spelling, Schuyler, it's Dutch for scholar and it was historically more common for boys than for girls. His family is showing their ignorance. Besides, even if they hate the name, mocking you for it at your baby shower was disgusting and rude.", "Absolutely NTA. That\u2019s horrible and I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with their bs. Definitely talk with your husband about setting boundaries before baby boy is born and for after he\u2019s born, as they give me the overbearing, bulldozing in laws type of vibes if they\u2019re already being rude when you\u2019re still pregnant all over his name.

There's something fundamentally wrong with people who throw a party for someone then proceed to insult them and make them cry.  \n\nI've always thought Skylar is a beautiful name and it doesn't matter if it has a deep meaning or if its something you got off the back of a cereal packet.  He's your baby and only you and your husband have a say in the name.\n\nI would watch out for your in-laws creating some sort of pet name for your son to use instead of  the one you chose.  My mum was named after her gran but when her gran found out she was horrified and proceeded to call her by the name she preferred.  Henceforth my mum was known as this name for the next 88 years of her life rather than the name on her birth certificate (although to be fair, gran was right in this case).", "NTA. They weren't celebrating your little boy, they were criticizing your choice and being mean about it.", "Absolutely NTA - what a bunch of heartless AHs your in-laws are! Especially the comment about returning the name and buying a better one... WTF?!\n\nI'm sure I've read a thread on this sub before where in-laws/family members didn't like the name a baby was given so called them by a different name. I hope your in-laws won't try something like this.\n\nIf they won't accept your sons name then I strongly suggest you go low/no contact. Sadly you can't return your in-laws in exchange for better human beings, but you don't have to have anything to do with them", "1) NTA for leaving on the grounds that they were rude about the name choice on its own grounds alone, dismissive of the thought and care that you both clearly put into it (hubby is a keeper) and very disrespectful of the memory of your brother and the love you still hold for him.\n\n2) personally I admire the historical / familial links to the name.  My 2/f middle name is my (dead) mother's first name. My 4 week old nephew's middle name is Aidan, an anagram of his maternal grandmother's name which was Diana. You two stick to your guns.\n\n3) There are plenty of unisex names and Skyler - whilst an uncommon one - is no exception. My wife and I (I'm male) have the exact same name ( like Mr and Mrs Sam Smith or Mr and Mrs Jo Jones).  Skyler is not exclusively female.\n\n4) You could maybe point them towards noted male Skyler's. Wikipedia (bless it's soul) throws up 12 male Skyler's including a few soccer players, some footballer players and if they're American and republicans then twist the knife hard with the information that Skyler Wheeler is a republican member of the Iowa house of representatives so they can go suck it.  If that is insufficient, go hard and twist the knife with the info that the 17th VP of the USA was a Schuyler Colfax which is these days more commonly spelt your way.  \n\nRespect to your hubby for helping you to step out of the toxic environment but then staying in it to defend you.  Major lad points for him.  Keeper on those grounds too.", "Nta. You picked a beautiful name that had real thought and meaning behind it. If your in laws can't accept that, then they don't need be apart of baby skye's life! My wife is pregnant with a baby boy too and she wants to name him for her grandpa, whom we lost in 2019. I already think you too are off to a good start as parents. Your husband being willing to stand up to his family is awesome, you married a good one, op!", "NTA you and your husband are the parents. Therefore you two are the only ones who get a say in the name. If his family doesn\u2019t like it, too bad, they don\u2019t have to. Plus I feel they went overboard with their comments. It\u2019d be bad enough if they just said they don\u2019t like it, but they double down and kept going with their comments. His family sounds very rude and obnoxious.", "NTA. Nothing rude about leaving. A group of people making insults about a name that means something to you. Husband was right to tell you to leave. Be ready for the nicknames when he's born.", "NTA. Even without your history with the name, your in-laws were being rude beyond words. It would have been rude simply to say they didn't like the name even if they had left it at that, but for them to continue to insult the name and just *keep going* is just inexcusable.\n\nGood for your husband for defending both you and the name and calling out his family. I don't know if this kind of behavior is typical for them or if it came out of nowhere, but they owe you a **huge** apology, to the point where you should not let them see the child until not only they apologize to you, but they make you a solemn promise to never make fun of the name again. \n\nIn short, you are not the AH for walking out. In absolutely no case were you the one being rude.", "NTA. You are never obligated to let anyone mistreat you or your family - including your unborn child.

Your inlaws are unbelievably cruel, especially knowing your history and your connection with that name. I know guys named Skye (not Skylar) and they are the most grounded, wonderful men that you would ever meet. You and your husband were correct to leave and he was correct to yell at his family. If they don't like the name, they don't need to have interaction with your son. Congratulations on your pregnancy and your supportive husband. I am sorry that your inlaws are idiots.", "NTA. They did not behave as if they were celebrating your boy. Kudos to your husband for getting you out of there and dealing with his family. This is how it should be done.", "Definitely NTA. You're not supposed to make mommy-to-be cry at her baby shower. That was so mean and cold of them, especially knowing the deeply personal meaning the name had. \n\nI'm glad your husband defended you and gave them a piece of his mind. \n\nI'm sorry for your pain and losing your family so young. So glad you have a family of your own now.", "They were not celebrating they knew that it would hurt your feelings and they still did it they wanted to hurt and criticize you cut them off and say ur not speaking to them endless they oplogize keep the baby away from them and if they get more mad at you tell them what they did was awful and you won't forgive endless they act like they mean it I hope your first pregnancy is wonderful and that name is beautiful and so is the meaning don't cave because they absent minded and act like they can chose your baby's name\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Hello! I am really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve gone through so much. You are definitely NTA.

I hope you know that Skye is a very beautiful name and your brother is so proud and happy for you. I hope you also know that you are not powerless, this is your baby. You are allowed to set boundaries with anyone when it comes to your baby and are allowed to be upset when people insult the name you\u2019ve chosen. You are allowed to not want family around because they are toxic and because they hurt you. It seems like they have no respect for you if I\u2019m being honest. Even if I hated the name my family member chose for their kid, I would never outright insult them and berate them, ESPECIALLY when I know it means so much to them. I think you and your husband should talk about setting some boundaries around his family because they are mean and have berated you, and why would you want to hand YOUR baby to someone like that? I hope you find the solution that you are looking for and good luck!", "NTA \nWho cares if it's \"rude\" to leave a party where the hosts were beyond rude to you.
