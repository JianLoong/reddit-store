Insurance is paying you enough for that, I assume?", "NTA\n\nInsurance replaces like for like. He wants a brand new car and he wants you to pay for it? Hell no. Insurance will payout enough to buy a second hand car with the same stats his had. Why does he think he should get you to pay to replace something better than what he had?! And he cares more about getting a free upgrade out of you than the fact you could have been hurt?\n\nI'd have a long hard think about this.", "NTA. \n\nIf you broke a used car, you need to replace it by a car of the same value, NOT higher value.\n\nHis insurance will likely cover for the value of the car, so you should have to pay zero. If you both feel like the value the insurance gave you is under, then maybe you can help by adding a little.\n\nBut paying for a brand new car ?! That's excessive.", "NTA. You told him you are willing to pay most of it, which is fair. I'd pay the difference between what the insurance pays out and the cost of an exact replacement. If he wants to upgrade, that's on him.\n\nAlso, maybe take a step back and see if you still want to marry him. He's worried about money and not your safety, and he's making sexist jokes. Maybe this is unusual for him and all his good qualities balance the others out, but make sure that's the case before moving forward. Definitely have a serious talk with him about how you will handle money in the future.", "NTA - Supposing it was another driver's fault, with no injuries, there would only be a payout for the worth of the car.  Sometimes that doesn't cover the cost of a new car.  What is more concerning though is that you are about to marry this guy, and you and he have some more serious issues to work though.", "NTA - I think he should be buying whatever vehicle the payout will buy, or he needs to argue with his insurance about the actual value of his vehicle. You sound reasonable to be open to paying \u2018the lions share\u2019 as you put it, and he really should have considered that letting you use the car that he is assuming risk with this. He wants a sparkly new car out of this mishap and isn\u2019t willing to pay for the upgrade.

Have you been checked over?\n\nGet yoursen a sugary cuppa and take care.", "NTA his insurance should cover him with a like for like replacement. Unless it was an almost new car, he is not entitled to a new car.", "NTA, but this is a pretty big red flag before your spring wedding (1. that he cares more about the car than if you're okay and 2. that you haven't discussed how joint finances will look). \n\nWhy does he expect to get a brand new car instead of something equivalent to the car? Would you two be able to split a car payment equally since it sounds like you regularly drive a vehicle that he has paid for? Have you offered any compromise amount that you're willing to put into a new vehicle in addition to the insurance payment?", "What would the cars depreciated value be?  Let's do the math.\n\nHe bought the car for $20k, but it's only worth $10k now.  Insurance pays you $5k.  So, you make up the difference between current worth and insurance $10k - $5k = $5k.  If he wants another $20k car, then he pays the other $10k.\n\nNTA if that's what your planning/offering.\n\n\"He also made a fairly nasty \u2018joke\u2019 about me being a female driver\"  Is this someone  you want to spend your life with?", "He's right that it's no way for yall to start a new life togethe.

He was never going to get the amount he paid for the car out of it thats how it works when you buy a car. The value depreciates. so why are you expected to buy him something more valuable than what you broke? That part makes absolutely no sense. \n\nHe WANTS something more than what he currently has, and that's fine.. but expecting you to pay for the upgrade is absolutely ridiculous.

It\u2019s not fair of him to ask you to pay for a new car, for a mistake. He has disregard for your safety. But, since this was a shared car, I\u2019d work out a payment plan *together*. Finances will be joint in marriage-with that argument he should pay for half.", "argument number 1) and 3) are not valid, but I think the argument with \"new car\" vs. \"car with same age/mileage\" and reasonable.", "NTA. Maybe you crashed the car because of the huge red flag in your face that is your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA Solely on the basis that you shouldn\u2019t have to buy him a new car if you didn\u2019t wreck a new car. But to say it wasn\u2019t really your fault is BS.", "I'm glad you are ok! I'm going to go with NTA and that he's kinda being TAH here.  You shouldn't have to pay more because he wants a certain type of new car.  I would agree to pay for what the trade in value of the car would've been BEFORE the accident (less whatever insurance pays out).  If you want, you can help him with a downpayment on a new car, but if you do that, I think the decision for WHAT car you get, should be made by both of you, AND that you should purchase the car together.", "NTA,\n\nMost places make you liable for direct equivalent replacement cost. That's it, no more. (Please verify the law in your area) If you have offered to help pay a portion of getting a non equivelant replacement than you are being a good fiance.\n\nHe is right that this is no way to start a life together, he is just wrong about where the blame resides.  I would seriously begin evaluating your marriage plans if he is going to act like this. He is the one being unreasonable by not budging and is trying to shift blame to justify his actions.", "If he wants a new car he's in for a wait, 6-9 months on most models  in the UK", "NTA. He has insurance, you\u2019re a named driver and accidents happen. And I think your position of it being a joint expense is totally reasonable considering your getting married in the summer. Having said that, this kind of behavior from my future fianc\u00e9 might give me second thoughts.", "NTA. \n\nYou two had an agreement that you could drive the car, since you were even a listed driver, and your accident is something that happens. Lots of perfectly fine drivers are in accidents- including ice- and that is why you have insurance. Insurance has assessed the value of the vehicle, so now you two have a choice to get something that is of the same value, or put money towards a more expensive vehicle. He doesn't get to unilaterally decide what the new vehicle should be AND that you should pay for it. \n\nI think you take a step back. Tell him you had a really terrifying accident- and it was an accident- and he is focusing on money and actually how you can make HIM better off, instead of if you are okay. There is a time and place to talk about this, and it isn't day one of the accident. Then you tell him sexist \"jokes\" are never welcome, especially when they aren't really a joke because you just had a traumatic event. \n\nAnd then finally, you two need to talk about money. Things are going to happen that are purely accidents in your shared lives. When possible, you have insurance and that covers it, but you are likely never going to be made \"whole\" and that is an unreasonable expectation in a partner. \n\nSo your partner needs to appreciate that this was an accident and you two should go in together on a new car, in both your names, or he can buy his own car with the insurance money only and it can be in his name, and then you get your own car so you don't have this problem going forward.", "NTA - It was totally your fault that there was ice on the road, and there were inadequate tires on the car to stop you in time... Insurance is already paying him what the car is worth. Relationship aside, you would still only be responsible for the current market value of the car, not the replacement cost for a new car. What's to stop him from getting a $30k, or a $50k car and making you pay the difference. That's ridiculous.", "NTA, it seems like your fianc\u00e9 is using an unfortunately accident to enrich himself with a newer vehicle.  If you decide to go in jointly on a car you both own, I can see paying more.  If you are replacing his then your responsibility is the gap to replacement cost of lost car\u2019s age and mileage and I guess the increases insurance premiums.", "NTA. He\u2019s showing you his true colors. Are you sure you want to marry somebody like this??", "NTA if he goes for like for like fair enough but a newer model especially with car prices as high as they are in the UK at the moment is unreasonable.\nIf this is how he is acting now over and accident maybe you should really evaluate the relationship before marriage", "Insurance literally is paying him what his car was worth.  Obviously there is a bit more to it than just that, but his behavior seems like he might not be emotionally ready to be married.  NTA", "\"the cost of buying a new car\"  \n\n\nInsurance replaces same with same. If your soon-to-be-ex fiance wants a new car, he can pony up the difference. NTA.", "Nta he needs to have a car same age and milage as the old one that's what the insurance is for. If he wants an upgrade that is on him to pay the difference. If the insurance paid less than a swap I'd say u would have to make up the difference but not for a newer car.", "NTA, but maybe you both should get a better insurance policy for the new car so you can cover replacement value in the future.", "NTA. Most people have covered the car angle. But to me the other glaring issue is the fact that he's trying to profit off of you and ignoring the very reasonable point you made about joint finances. It feels like he's trying to get as much money as he can before he can't get away with it anymore. He also seems a lot more worried about the car than about you and that's concerning about someone you plan to spend your life with.\n\nA proper reaction would have been to be glad you're safe and ok and then sit with you to work on a solution to get a good car. It is a good chance to upgrade for a safer car specially in the context of an accident and it would have been a great chance for you guys to split the difference on what the insurance doesn't cover. As you know. A couple should do. \n\nI'd really think long and hard about whether this is a one off or a pattern and how this might affect the future for you both.", "Edit: NTA, reasoning below in my reply.\n\nI N F O: Why do you not have your own car?", "ESH. He should not expect a newer car at your cost. If it cost more than insurance to get an identical(or close to it) car then yes you should cover that difference.", "NTA he is owed the value of the car. If insurance isn\u2019t giving he the value of car you owe the difference. If he wants to upgrade that would be a shared expense since you both drive it. If that happens make sure your name is on the title too.", "So.... This guy wants a newer car. And he suckered you into driving his older one, hoping against hope you get in an accident so you would \"owe\" him a newer car. \n\nIf you're sharing the car? You should contribute to the cost of a new car together, according to what you each can do. \n\nIn my opinion you owe him the deductible. And you owe it to yourself to break up with him immediately after paying it to him. NTA\n\nEdit: the 1st paragraph is an unsuccessful attempt to use exaggeration for emphasis / effect. Please forgive me/ \ndon't take it literally.", "ESH. Your fiance sucks for making a sexist comment and wanting more than the car was worth. \n\nYou suck for not taking responsibility for the accident. Bad weather is not an excuse, you need to drive appropriately for the conditions.", "He's right. If he crashed it himself, he'd owe the difference. If you crash it, you owe the difference. You aren't hurt, so it's irrelevant and not something to stress over so IDK why you think he should be concerned about a could have been. If your expenses will be joint anyway, then why does it matter now if you give him the money.  But the real answer here is to google the make/model and mileage of the car and find the value. Subtract what insurance is paying from that value and then pay him the difference.", "How much is he wanting? Because i dont think you should pay full but obviously you will have to give him money for a new one. Hes the a-hole for the women driver joke and caring more for his car.", "The fact that you could have been hurt has nothing to do with the debate so I would put that aside.\n\n\nBad weather in itself doesn't cause the damage it's a combo of the drivers performance and the conditions. So yes you are responsible for damaging his property that he paid for on his own.\n\n\nYou could argue that many others drivers were run off the road and that so it's more the conditions than the driving that affected the outcome (if that is the case).\n\n\nRealistically it's most probably the driver at fault here for the damage. But that said you were driving an old car so if you were to replace it you should replace it with a car of equal value (another old car). He got a lot of mileage out of the old one and you should not have to pay for the part he has already consumed. You should propose this and if he is smart he will kick in extra to get a better vehicle that is safer and more comfortable for both of you and start things on the right foot. He is probably miffed that he has to change now and about the inconvenience of not having a car. But getting a better one should help smooth that out.\n\n\nSo yes pay the lion's share of getting an old car for him and offer that he kick in for a nicer or newer model. And forget about the fact that he doesn't see you as married already.\n\n\nYTA for crashing the car and not taking replacing it but in the end it's a wash because NTA for assuming he would want to kick in as a show of good faith for your futur together.", "ESH.  Neither one of you sounds ready to be married.  You\u2019re not respectful of each other b", "YTA - simply because driving in bad weather is irresponsible driving.
