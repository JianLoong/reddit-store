How many weeks or months before the wedding did you get the invite?

OP, what does that mean?", "So vague. And my cynical side is thinking it was intentionally vague, and so without more, OP, I think YTA. \n\nSort of feels like OP was offended by not being able to take her child to begin with, and extra pissed when no exception would be granted for her. Also, it is not clear by OP on when the conversation with bff took place, but from context it seems like it was on the day of the ceremony?! Am I wrong? Because she has this convo and bff suggests she skip ceremony and come to reception because OP may be able to find someone to watch her child \u201cby then\u201d ??? Like it definitely seems like a day-of phone call. Which, despite the fact that it seems OP is being cagey about the amount of time she had to arrange for a sitter prior to the wedding date, is INCREDIBLY rude to do to a bride on her wedding day. And to me, it seems like bff tried to offer a reasonable solution that was very understanding of the situation, by suggesting that OP miss the freaking ceremony! Helped OP try to find a solution. But OP, you found it unreasonable because it wasn\u2019t what you wanted to hear. You were expecting to call her last minute, feign a baby sitter crisis, and be granted an exception to their no child rule. And It looks like by OP\u2019s own admission that upon hearing that, she didn\u2019t even attempt to try and find a sitter because it was going to be all or nothing\u2026 despite the fact that it was bff\u2019s idea that she miss part of it if she needed to and to come for the reception. Upon hearing that from the bride, why would you think it was pointless to not go to the reception if you couldn\u2019t also go to the ceremony? Ceremonies are often not long anyway (I know that many are, but I\u2019m referring to those that I\u2019m familiar with I guess), and it\u2019s not like you are talking to the bride during that part anyhow. \n\nIdk, but OP it feels like you are really leaving some stuff out here. Although I also don\u2019t agree with bff saying you \u201cprioritized\u201d your child over her wedding day, because of course your child would take precedence. However, it definitely seems like you prioritized wanting to take your child to a no kids wedding over respecting their wishes and actively trying to be there for your \u201cbff\u201d\n\n\n(Also want to say - with regard to finding bff\u2019s refusal to allow OP to be the exception to the kid rule - you also have to think about all the other attendees who would be at the wedding who had to arrange child care in order to be there\u2014 it would be messy for bff to have to deal with that dichotomy with the guests who were prohibited from being their children and actually complied, and would potentially irritate/disrespect other guests, and nobody needs that added burden on their wedding day while making rounds talking to people!)\n\n\n\nIf it were a person who was not your proclaimed best friend, or if it were a case where your sitter- that you would\u2019ve hypothetically arranged- had to cancel late and you were left having to call around last minute to find someone and came up short, and then were unable to go, or another hypo situation along these lines, then no, you wouldn\u2019t be the AH. But rn, it looks like you are imo.", "I can't speak for OP, but I only have two people locally that can watch my kids.  If they aren't available, we can't go out.", "The bride is The A for saying OP put her daughter first, like... yes. \n\nCould OP tried harder for a Nanny? Probably, but there's a reason those are invitation not court orders. People is entitled to decline.", "I was wondering that too. Ultimately, nta for not going, but I\u2019m inclined to believe that they didn\u2019t try very hard to make it. Short notice for a wedding is probably still months, at least", "That could be... but then, it would be pretty clear who's at fault.", "Yeah\u2026 invitations are usually sent out a minimum of three months out. The many I\u2019ve been to I know of even a year or more in advance if I\u2019m in the bridal party. The fact OP hasn\u2019t responded to the 20 people asking this makes me think those saying she \u201ccould have done more\u201d might not be too wrong in feeling the way they do. The notice period is pretty important.", "I agree, it does seems like OP is TA.\nHow is a wedding \"short notice\"? And also, why ask special accommodation instead of just telling her that you wouldn't be attending?\nIt seems like OP made a vague post on purpose to not have the blame put on her. She should've prepared for her best friend's wedding better. \nIt seems like OP didn't look for a nanny because she was expecting her friend to accommodate her kid.\nSo OP YTA", "Save the dates go out months in advance.\n\nThe actual formal invitation is usually 6-8 weeks. Still plenty of time to find a sitter if you really want one.\n\nSounds to me like husband didn't want to go and \"can't find a sitter\" was the excuse.
