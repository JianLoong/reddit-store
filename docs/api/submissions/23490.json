The reason I am wondering if I was wrong is we have never really made the effort to invite my sister's stepdaughter to other things and considering the kids are similar ages, maybe I could have asked if he'd want to have her there.

She can have several seats and focus on herself. Is it any of your issues why the child never gets invited to birthday parties? I definitely think not. Don\u2019t argue with your sister over this, just say your piece and continue on your way. She just wants to pick fights and be miserable.", "NTA.

I'm sure there are people who have done it, but it's weird.  What gets me is that this party included a sleep over at an Air B&B.

That's just ordinary.", "NTA. Your sister is wrong for blaming everyone else for her stepdaughter not meeting the family. Your sister is also wrong for thinking her stepdaughter should have been included in something for your son and his closest friends. Your sister is even more wrong for berating you and calling you an asshole for excluding her step kid from something that she didn't belong in.\n\nI think I would just block her. You aren't close, she's being unreasonable, and she is berating you for not meeting her absurd expectations.

It's your son's birthday, for his friends, not to take a complete stranger along. \n\nIf your sister wanted better contact and for you to meet her husband and his daughter then there are better times to do that, and I would question why she hasn't made the effort before now.  Very coincidental that it comes up when you are taking the kids away somewhere fun!", "NTA - Did she even call to wish your son Happy Birthday?\n\nShe is so removed from the family that she didn't even do that but expects an invitation for her step-daughter after the fact?\n\nWow she is a self-involved drama llama.\n\nYou haven't even met your BIL yet either.", "How many 9 year-old boys would want a girl stranger at their getaway? At that age most boys are allergic to girls, even classmates.

Even if she lived next door, you wouldn't have been obligated to invite her, but she lives STATES away! Let me guess, you would've been expected to cover the cost of her travel too. NTA", "NTA.  She seriously wanted you to invite a child you haven't met to your son's party? Was she also expecting you to pay the airfare?  I think the answer would be yes. \n\nShe wanted a weekend free of the kid and is mad because you aren't psychic enough to do what she thinks.", "NTA. If your son knew and liked step, who lived nearby, sure.\n\nIf you and your sister had a relationship and you wanted to invite her family to meet up at the water park and have step bring a friend.

Why doen't SHE invite them?", "Who would send their 8 year old daughter off for a weekend with people she had never met? Your sister is an AH.  \nNTA.", "Not the AH.  I suspect this has nothing to do with the step and everything to do with her feeling the long term effects of her self-inflicted isolation.   She distanced herself from the family and can't think up a good way to ask to come back in.  Maybe reach out and ask her gently if this is the case.", " NTA \n\nBut your sister is insane for getting upset.", "I remember well the Cootie Plague of 1978...chaos.", "Sad times, sad times.

Why is it OP's (or the other siblings') responsibility to reach out to the sister and stepdaughter rather than sister and BIL's?"]}
