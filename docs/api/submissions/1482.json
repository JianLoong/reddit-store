Well my friend said he was going to a party tonight and he said that the person throwing the party may shoot someone tonight.

I asked someone if they knew where the party was tonight (not my friend because he would be suspicious because i don\u2019t party) and they gave me a location. So i was heading home from uni and notified the campus police about what I had heard and they asked to call my friend so I gave them his number and name. I feel like I overreacted.\n\nedit: someone was shot on campus a few weeks ago at a party and someone also committed suicide two weeks ago in our campus library so everyone is on high alert.", "created_utc": 1667619137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymj0aj/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_a_party/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I called the cops on a party at my uni where someone is rumored to be shooting someone else\n2.

You didn\u2019t even know where the party was being held.\n\nAnd yet you considered it your business to call the cops, make a report about a potential event that could have been totally fabricated.

You potentially put your friend in grave danger (that he wouldn\u2019t otherwise have been in) by making this report.", "NTA. Better to be safe than sorry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
