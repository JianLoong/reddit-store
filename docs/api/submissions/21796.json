You say she doesn't even pay rent or the bills why are you tolerating her? NTA for your money back, she owes you.

At this point you need to watch your back, get cameras, start recording and let her know you don\u2019t want to be around her unless you are.

Along with the threat to out you as the gay man you aren't. \n\n\nOnce you have the texts safely stored as screenshots in at least a couple of places tell her that you're going to make her a cash for keys offer- she's out in two weeks (peacefully) or you take her to small claims court. \n\nTo warn you, she may legally be considered a tenant, with the right to  10-30 days of notice and a hearing in eviction court. She may not know that, in which case your offer could work.  Look up your local tenant's union and see what the legal notice requirements are for roommates. (Don't worry about standard tenants- roommates who share the landlord's kitchen almost always require a shorter notice period.)\n\n\nIf she realizes that she has the right to a legal notice and eviction process, up your offer to waiving the small claims court PLUS giving her cash for a down on her next place. Eviction will cost you $1000-3000 and take 3-6 weeks, so solving her cash problem in order to get her out is almost always the fastest cheapest deal for you.", "NTA - you deserve your money, especially if you are the one paying for everything. get your money and a new roommate... stat.", "There doesn\u2019t seem to be any gray area here.
