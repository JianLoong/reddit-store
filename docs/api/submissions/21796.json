She may not know that, in which case your offer could work.  Look up your local tenant's union and see what the legal notice requirements are for roommates. (Don't worry about standard tenants- roommates who share the landlord's kitchen almost always require a shorter notice period.)\n\n\nIf she realizes that she has the right to a legal notice and eviction process, up your offer to waiving the small claims court PLUS giving her cash for a down on her next place. Eviction will cost you $1000-3000 and take 3-6 weeks, so solving her cash problem in order to get her out is almost always the fastest cheapest deal for you.", "NTA - you deserve your money, especially if you are the one paying for everything. get your money and a new roommate... stat.", "There doesn\u2019t seem to be any gray area here.
