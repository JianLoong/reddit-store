Her flirty behavior while saying \"just friends\" was confusing and discomforting to both of you. When your guy friend asked her outright, you had the choice to either be complicit to her lying to him or bring the full truth to light.\n\nHer behavior isn't harmless. She was manipulating your other friend by encouraging him to put energy and attention into what he thought was the beginning of a romantic relationship. While her behavior was escalating, encouraging more familiarity and touching, her saying \"just friends\" could easily (and deliberately) be understood to be encouragement to continue to invest in the \"friendship\" until they know eachother a bit longer and go for romance. She gets the most attention for the least investment. He gets strung along, maybe some sex eventually, but probably used and broken hearted at the end.\n\nIf he knew she was dating others, and \"has a bf,\" that puts a different light on her behavior and their \"friendship.\" He knows he's not rare and special to her. He's a guy she has some interest in and attraction for, \"as friends \" He could then choose how much of his time and energy he wants to give her with a clearer understanding of his priority in her life.\n\nIt was selfish of your friend to flirt and pet your other friend, knowing her cheating behavior made you uncomfortable. MAYBE she didn't realize it did. Definitely she didn't care. In future, it's okay to say you don't want to be around certain manipulative, upsetting or toxic behavior. People will either respect that and refrain, or continue and you leave the situation.", "NTA. She's either secretly into him, likes the attention or is scared he's just into this friendship for the chance on getting laid. None of that makes it OK for him to suffer. She's got to be honest with him, especially if she cares for him in any way. \n\nGood for you to end this shit. I'd have gone nuts way sooner.", "NTA she is cheating on her boyfriend", "NTA so she liked the benefits of being his girlfriend without being his girlfriend. AKA his attention time and money. Yep this is very common. Especially nowadays.", "Soft NTA \n\nYour friend is clearly going for the toxic slow burn romance atm in her life \ud83e\udd74\n\n I don't think her and her boyfriend are an exclusive couple based on the way you described how she was acting and with her saying that they were low key. Your friend could be just throwing that title around for the hell of it and it's really a \" *situationship* \" \n\nBut from now on keep some distance between your friend... because the next thing is you might find yourself in some drama of being accused of wanting whatever next guy is on her radar.", "I think the constantly telling him that she had no interest in him was a sign that she wasn't going to cheat with him...\nIf she wanted it to be physical it sounds as if it could have been multiple times but wasn't interested. She likes getting the attention from him but he is willing to give the attention knowing she keeps telling him she isn't interested, if OP was a good friend to him they would be telling him to walk away, not exposing personal information"]}
