Yes, $5k for a laptop means it is a gaming laptop, and a very expensive one at that.  Food or Games, that is the question.**", "NTA. No one needs a $5000 laptop for gaming or streaming. It's nice, but it's a huge luxury purchase. It seems like he has bad financial literacy.\n\nThis isn't on you. He's the asshole for even asking. I'd drop him like its hot.", "NTA.

There's a bit of an age gap here and this makes me slightly wary.

You are not such a person.", "NTA. \n\nThe big red flag to me was his dreams of making his fortune with his twitch/gaming channel.  \n\nit's not going to happen. That market is so oversaturated. And it makes me question his overall decision making skills as he lives in poverty. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is not your problem- He needs to live within his means and you are not his bank. \n\nThis relationship will continue to face these issues so you need to ask yourself if it is worth it.", "So he spent $5,000 and now has no money for bills/food, and wants you to help support him?

Is this the dynamic you want to continue for your relationship?", "NTA but he definitely is.\n\nIf he hadnt spent $5,000 on a laptop, I\u2019d feel sorry for him,  But he basically did this to himself,  its unfair and unreasonable of him to expect you to bail him out.\n\nYou are not obligated, but if you are that worried, buy him a bag of groceries of the bare essentials only (don\u2019t take him shopping with you). Milk, bread, peanut butter, apples.", "NTA he made his bed and needs to learn from his mistakes. He shouldn't put you on that situation.", "NTA.

I do understand that when you have a little money it's hard to not want to spend some on yourself even if you aren't well off, because everyone deserves something nice. But him spending a full $5000 on something that isn't a necessity when he needed to pay bills isn't your problem. He seems irresponsible at best\n\nETA: I think I was too vague, by 'It's hard to believe' I meant he was definitely expecting you to pay his bills and thought he could just pretend he forgot", "He makes impulsive decisions and expects you to be his safety net when the dust settles?

I have a feeling that he wouldn't have bought it if he didn't have a wealthy girlfriend that he could lay a guilt trip on.\n\nPlease do not give him money to rescue him from the hole he willingly dug himself into. If you do, he will keep wasting his money in stupid ways and demanding that you save him from himself.", "NTA. There is a huge difference between genuinely needing financial assistance, and being completely financially illiterate. He needs help to manage his money, handouts will make things worse.", "NTA because of the laptop. If he's in debt and struggling to pay his bills, I don't see how he can justify the splurge, when a powerful laptop could be found for far less. He wants to keep the thing he couldn't afford while having you bail him out, and I promise that if you do, it won't be the last time he asks.\n\nIs there anything you or your family could do to help him understand how to manage his finances?", "NTA.  You\u2019re not a married couple and so whats yours is yours and he has no claim on it whatsoever.  He\u2019s a 27-year-old man and should be able to figure out his finances by now and only buy something that\u2019s within his budget. It\u2019s not your job to bail him out.", "NTA. Boyfriend needs to go. He sounds like an entitled user. If he's dumb enough to spend all his money on a laptop for gaming (NOBODY needs a $5000 laptop, especially for school), then that's on him. You can do better.", "NTA imo", "NTA. I'm reminded of some advice I heard that if someone close to you asks you for money and you care about them enough they would give them a one time amount to pay for whatever they need (if they can afford to do that) with the condition that that person can never ask for money again, this prevents it from becoming a recurring thing and you helping them out until they get back on their feet. But, in my opinion this is a highly generous thing to do and you would NT be an asshole either way.", "NTA. His poor choices are his responsibility and you are right when you say your dad's money isnt yours to hand out how you see fit. Your dad is trusting you to make smart choices with the money he supports you with and you are making the right choice by saying no.\n\nTake it from someone who finally was able to oust a freeloader like this after being entangled for a decade...this is only the beginning.", "NTA he is using you for your privilege. He is a 27 year old adult if he cannot afford to eat then he needs to sell the laptop. I personally would be running from the red flags here", "a 5k computer for school??? was bro planning on going on all pixel diet??", "NTA. He can get a decent gaming PC for 1/3 of that price and use the excess to buy food. I spent 8 years with a man who prioritized gaming expenses over living expenses. Don\u2019t waste your time.

Never say your parents are rich. Never let on that you too, don\u2019t struggle with money.  Even moreover 5k is a lot of money to pay for a comp. And for most people that\u2019s a completely unnecessary amount to spend on a comp.  That an example of being bad with money. Unless he works ina field, where that type of comp is necessarily. That\u2019s something you should bring up with your bf when you talk about future financial goals.

Meanwhile, I would be deeply thinking about continuing the relationship. The goal of a relationship is to be compatible and be able to uplift one another in different aspects, including financially. He\u2019s 6 years older than you and still doesn\u2019t understand money. That should be a major red flag.

My dad was much more well off than his family and he would play fast and loose with our bill money, or not put in his fair share and then pressure me to go to my dad. \n\nYour dad's money is not your money. You're not a bad partner by not taking care of someone financially who is 6 years your senior and should know better than to buy a $5k laptop instead of food. \n\nIf his finances are this bad are there social services he can get? Why is it your responsibility? Being a partner is something you grow into, it doesn't sound like you're there yet.", "NTA and stop dating him.

If he\u2019s aggressive or angry or manipulative about it all, it might be worth re-evaluating the relationship. Finances can be a big stressor.", "NTA but come on, if your partner literally can't afford food and you're not giving them money to buy food, then wtf are you even in this relationship for? Either give them the money or break up with them, but there's no middle ground.", "Yes you are an asshole for not assisting him financially. You're in a partnership with him, and financially supporting has always been and will always be a part of that.

Even if his financial situation improves, it\u2019s unlikely his attitude will. \n\nIf you\u2019re not quite ready to break up with him, and you want to help, you could buy some cheap food and meal prep 10 or so meals so that he isn\u2019t literally starving.

Then you\u2019ll see pretty clearly if he\u2019s appreciative of your help, or is still a jerk when you\u2019re trying to help him. And the ability to prep food like that is a great skill to work on anyway in case you need to really scale back spending sometime in the future, so if you do end up breaking up anyway you\u2019ve still learned something helpful for yourself.
