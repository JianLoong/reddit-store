Milk, bread, peanut butter, apples.", "NTA he made his bed and needs to learn from his mistakes. He shouldn't put you on that situation.", "NTA.

I do understand that when you have a little money it's hard to not want to spend some on yourself even if you aren't well off, because everyone deserves something nice. But him spending a full $5000 on something that isn't a necessity when he needed to pay bills isn't your problem. He seems irresponsible at best\n\nETA: I think I was too vague, by 'It's hard to believe' I meant he was definitely expecting you to pay his bills and thought he could just pretend he forgot", "He makes impulsive decisions and expects you to be his safety net when the dust settles?

I have a feeling that he wouldn't have bought it if he didn't have a wealthy girlfriend that he could lay a guilt trip on.\n\nPlease do not give him money to rescue him from the hole he willingly dug himself into. If you do, he will keep wasting his money in stupid ways and demanding that you save him from himself.", "NTA. There is a huge difference between genuinely needing financial assistance, and being completely financially illiterate. He needs help to manage his money, handouts will make things worse.", "NTA because of the laptop. If he's in debt and struggling to pay his bills, I don't see how he can justify the splurge, when a powerful laptop could be found for far less. He wants to keep the thing he couldn't afford while having you bail him out, and I promise that if you do, it won't be the last time he asks.\n\nIs there anything you or your family could do to help him understand how to manage his finances?", "NTA.  You\u2019re not a married couple and so whats yours is yours and he has no claim on it whatsoever.  He\u2019s a 27-year-old man and should be able to figure out his finances by now and only buy something that\u2019s within his budget. It\u2019s not your job to bail him out.", "NTA. Boyfriend needs to go. He sounds like an entitled user. If he's dumb enough to spend all his money on a laptop for gaming (NOBODY needs a $5000 laptop, especially for school), then that's on him. You can do better.", "NTA imo", "NTA. I'm reminded of some advice I heard that if someone close to you asks you for money and you care about them enough they would give them a one time amount to pay for whatever they need (if they can afford to do that) with the condition that that person can never ask for money again, this prevents it from becoming a recurring thing and you helping them out until they get back on their feet. But, in my opinion this is a highly generous thing to do and you would NT be an asshole either way.", "NTA. His poor choices are his responsibility and you are right when you say your dad's money isnt yours to hand out how you see fit.

He can get a decent gaming PC for 1/3 of that price and use the excess to buy food. I spent 8 years with a man who prioritized gaming expenses over living expenses. Don\u2019t waste your time.

Meanwhile, I would be deeply thinking about continuing the relationship. The goal of a relationship is to be compatible and be able to uplift one another in different aspects, including financially. He\u2019s 6 years older than you and still doesn\u2019t understand money. That should be a major red flag.

My dad was much more well off than his family and he would play fast and loose with our bill money, or not put in his fair share and then pressure me to go to my dad. \n\nYour dad's money is not your money. You're not a bad partner by not taking care of someone financially who is 6 years your senior and should know better than to buy a $5k laptop instead of food. \n\nIf his finances are this bad are there social services he can get?

However, I am not an atm and neither is my father. I have an agreement with my dad to support me through school and what he does with **his** money is is choice, just as it was to prioritize an expensive laptop before the basics.\n\n2) if you're that hungry, then perhaps a spare job if you can fit it in? Task rabbit, fiverr, tee spring, there's several online ways to make money just the same as twitch.\n\n3) stop trying to emotionally blackmail me because we have different priorities and privileges.\n\n4) if I buy you food for today, will you return/resell the laptop and get one you **can** afford and not one you wish you could afford?", "Nta.

To be honesty he should be maybe at least asked to buy a laptop if anything. But what sucks is that if you gifted him that, he'd be more willing to sell it since he had no responsibility (aka his own money) put into it, and could've hurt you that way too. Definitely confront him about this and the fact that there's no way he would've done this purchase if he didn't think of you or someone else to bail him out of having no money for food or bills already.

He definitely does not need an expensive laptop to game with. He is also assuming he will make the money back asap on twitch also when in reality unless he blows up on twitch... It's super unrealistic. You are definitely correct on telling him to sell it since he can find one for cheap. Your dad's money is not your bf to spend.

It is not easy to max out a credit card unless the limit is low, in which case its easier to pay it off as well. Hes obviously living beyond his means and wanting you to be his piggy bank so he can keep making bad choices. A person like this is not going to help you in life. He's just going to drag you down into ruin with him.\n\nIf your set on this guy, you can try to educate him on proper spending habits and how to budget for things.
