You set the expectation for the friendship. You should be equally upset with yourself as you are with your friends. \n\nThe truth is, it\u2019s going to be very hard re-educating your friends on how they should treat you. Best case, maybe 1 in 4 will stay with you all the way to real friend.

If you cant do it without going over the top then maybe you shouldn't. Skip the conversation and go for therapy", "Now, this thought process isn't for everyone... But if you find this is the case with most or all of your friends, what's the common denominator? Perhaps you should bring it up to one friend as if you're referring to another? Explain to friend A that you're really struggling with friend B and that you find it to be a very fairweather or one sided friendship, and that you're wondering what it is that makes things this way?\n\nThis might make it easier to ease into asking them if they feel the same way. Keep your temper in check, and explain that it is something that bothers you and you'd really like to get to the bottom of it so you can fix it.\n\nHere's gonna be the point where you're TA or NTA. If the friend tells you something that they feel is contributing to this behaviour, you have to own it and not retaliate, defend or deny it.\n\nIf you wanna fix the issue, you need to be okay with potentially being the issue.\n\nSo... Definitely NTA but it depends on the delivery of the confrontation and how you handle their reaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
