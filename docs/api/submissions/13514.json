So will her sister.  No, your wife cannot prevent that or save them from themselves.  Yes, they will likely be very angry if she doesn't intervene.  No, they may not forgive her.  Yes, they may harass her or even get violent over this.  No, giving in is not better. Yes, she can and should put her and you and your child ahead of the adults who refuse to save themselves.\"\n\nBecause all of those are hard things to hear, and sticking to the plan to set limits and not save them will be very difficult.
