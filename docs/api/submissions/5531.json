Thanks, mom.\n\nNTA.\n\nThe word hasn't been polite for forty or fifty years, so it certainly wasn't 18 years ago.

That's deeply hurtful to deal with from your own family.

Mom's basically saying it's okay for homophobes to bully her child because \"They're right\"", "Nta is your mom for real. I am sorry your family hurt you", "NTA, that\u2019s an awful thing for them to do and you have every right to feel the way you do! It\u2019s shocking that they were so callous about it and your mum should understand that! How would she feel if the bets were on about a relationship of hers lasting (just as an example), would she be fine with it ending just because they were right?! I doubt it. Maybe if she thinks on it in that way she will understand more!", "NTA. What they did is sickening.", "NTA.  This was not a \"lighthearted bet\".  It was flat out bullying. Small wonder it impacted you so strongly, being bullied by \"grown ups\" at such a young age.  Make sure you call it bullying everything the topic is discussed  especially with your mother.  Ask her if she really intends to support and enable adults that bullied her child.", "Yta", "The whole pot, if you please.  None of them should profit from being homophobic.", "Nta.

They called you a slur and degraded you. Your mother needs a reality check. They even called you the *f slur*. I wish I could give her a piece of my mind as both a gay man and a parent myself. I would lose it if my niece and nephew treated my son like that. They were way too old to treating anyone like that, let alone a literal child.", "NTA.\n\nReminds me of the time I was truly embarrassed when my parents said \"yeah that was obvious\" about a friend coming out having a girlfriend (who is now her wife)... she only had boyfriends until than and she never said she's a lesbian so could well be bi? That option doesn't even occured to my parents. So they only reason it was so \"obvious she's a lesbian\" was because she had short hair and liked to wear jeans and t-shirts instead of dresses. I love my parents but this comment made me sick (and I am not even part of the lgbtq+ group myself).\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you.

You did lose years from that bet as regardless of the intentions it negatively affected you & it probably made you refuse to begin to question yourself because of the possibility of them being right.

Somethings shouldn\u2019t be bet on and it sounds like they were trying to hurt you.", "NTA, and by the way family is not an obligation; you'll find people who accept you and treat you better and ditch them for your own good", "NTA so according to your mom's theory a group bullying an overweight child for being overweight doesn't have the right to be upset, \"because they are right\" or a person with glasses or a mental illness,  just because bullies use things that are actually accurate about a person doesn't make the bullying less hurtful or stop a person caring, it xan actually make it worse because you look in the mirror and see what they see and start to hate yourself for somthing often out of your control.  Your mother is wrong to diminish your feelings,  she is wrong to support your bully's behaviour.  She possibly never expirenced bullying and may need to have things explained but what she said makes her an ahole as much as your cousins", "It's not just the homophobia, it's the toxic masculinity.
