We moved to another country as soon as we got married, first year was hard neither of us had lived together before, but it got so much better by our first anniversary. Back in our original birth city we had such a different lives than we have here, back there was going out, hanging with family and friends and we\u2019re we live right now is only us 2, we have made some friends along the way but it will never feel like back home.\n\nMy husband before was a big drinker when we hang out with his friends our in family gatherings. Not a big fan of that as I\u2019m not a drinker but I respect him and normally I\u2019m the designated driver. Since we moved he dosent drinks like he used to before. As he dosent see his friends that often the times we have been back home he see them and goes out and I don\u2019t have a problem with that. \n\n(Something to mention he is the type of guy that feels that he is missing out on everything since we moved) \n\nNow to the situation: \n\nA friend not a best friend since high school is going to get married ( this friend made such drama in our weeding, that being the reason I don\u2019t like him) his weeding is outside the country, at first I was planning to go as I will be seeing the wife\u2019s of his friends which I really like, but no wife will be going to the weeding ( they also don\u2019t like the couple) only men, so I though maybe I shouldn\u2019t go no problem. I don\u2019t love him going by himself to party with his wild friends but I\u2019m not his mother to tell him what he should or should not be doing. \n\nWe found out that a concert I really! Want to go, that we bought tickets months ago is happening on the same weekend. When we found out his options were you come with me to the wedding or I go by myself I don\u2019t care about the concert. I told him that prior to knowing the dates or the wedding he really wanted to go and that for me it was important to go. I told him I\u2019m not going to say don\u2019t go, but you know my feelings and is something we planned together, choose what makes you feel better. \n\nHe choose the wedding. \n\nThe friend that is getting married have talked 4 times in the 2 years we moved from our birth city. \n\nI\u2019m a happy person, but right now I feel so sad, he is aware but choosing to ignore it. I feel like I can\u2019t get over it until the wedding passes. \n\nSome may say invite someone, all of my family and close friends have to take a plane, and I don\u2019t have the money to invite them. And it may sound stupid but being us too I imagine living that experience with him and he just did what was good for him not thinking about me. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697573581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a7hjy/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_go_to_a/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. You missing a concert is not the same as him missing an old friend\u2019s wedding. Just because people don\u2019t talk all the time, it doesn\u2019t mean the friendship is any less valued. Marriage is about compromise. Go to this wedding with your husband and do the concert another time.", ">so I though maybe I shouldn\u2019t go no problem.\n\n>When we found out his options were you come with me to the wedding or I go by myself I don\u2019t care about the concert.\n\n>And it may sound stupid but being us too I imagine living that experience with him and he just did what was good for him not thinking about me. \n\n\n\nSo you chose to not go to the wedding since the beginning. \n\nWhen you found out it was at the same weekend and you husband told you that you cold go to the wedding with him if you want or you could go to the concert, but he made that clear he will go to the wedding. You chose to go to the concert again.\n\nYou expect him to choose the concert even although he made clear that he is going to go to the wedding. And you say \"he did what was good for him\".\n\nSooooo...you want to do what is good FOR YOU and expect him to do what is good FOR YOU too even though he made clear what he wants and let you choose what you want without making a fuss about it.... Sigh...\n\nTbh, from what I read in your post, it sounds like you enjoy having a control over his life in that different country and if he goes to his hometown you will lose it...\n\nYTA", "He feels his is missing out on everything regarding his friends... wait for it... because he IS missing out on pretty much everything with his friends.  Sometimes things like this happen with conflict in plans.  I think most people will agree that a friend's wedding is more important than a single concert.  You do not get to make decisions on what is more important to him, he does that.  Him choosing the wedding over the concert is not him choosing the wedding over you.  Making this about you is manipulative and toxic.  YTA", "The real problem is that your husband is missing his friends, the town he lived in, friends, etc. The wedding is important to him because he gets to see people, you stated it's just you two all the time. \n\nEveryone needs a break from reality and to do something different.  I understand the concert is important to you but the wedding is to him.\n\nEither go to the wedding or let him go without you and you go to the concert alone.\n\n Sounds like you both need to get out around other people and a change of scenery, which can be a great thing.", "YTA.\n\nI think it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t go to the wedding, but it was planned and decided on before you knew about the concert. It\u2019s a little weird to think he should back out of attending a friend\u2019s wedding for that reason.", " YTA. You are adults. He can go to the wedding and you can go to the concert, but don\u2019t guilt him for wanting to go to his friend\u2019s wedding.", "YTA. \n\nWeddings > Concerts. \n\nYou\u2019ve been invited to an important day and you\u2019re more interested in hearing music you can hear for free, at home.", "YTA. Obviously going to a wedding is a perfectly valid reason to not go to a concert.", "Hi. I was married for 30 years, until my husband died. I am an expert in the matter of Seeds of Resentment, some of which are still blossoming to this day in my heart. Though thankfully most are gone. But some of the big ones have yet to fully wither away even though he has been dead for a decade. Enough about me.\n\nYour husband not wanting to go to a concert whose dates conflict with an important, planned event like a wedding in your home country is an annoying thing, but the seed of resentment should be small - like a strawberry - because a concert is just not that important in the grand scheme of life. Demanding that he skip this wedding and the chance to catch up with family and friends that he is longing to see, to see some entertainment, would be planting a Giant Avocado Seed of Resentment in him because you clearly don\u2019t care about his feelings about it.  Giant Seeds of Resentment don\u2019t disappear. Drop this and let that little seed of resentment for him not picking your desired entertainment over seeing people important to him, die unnourished. YTA", "YTA. Please try to not make this about you. He didn't choose the wedding over you, he chose the wedding over a concert.", "So you don\u2019t tell him what to do but you\u2019ll be sad if he doesn\u2019t do what you want? YTA", "YTA.  The commitment to the wedding was made before the concert. Therefore,  the wedding trumps the concert, no matter what.", "YTA. You sound like a teenager. Grow up", "YTA. But softly. It sucks that it happened the way it did but concerts do go on sale long before you would get an invitation to a wedding or other similar event. With your husband feeling like he is missing out on so much it makes sense he would choose the wedding.\n\nThe part where you are softly YTA is that you offered him a choice but then resent the choice he made, which means you weren\u2019t offering him a real\nchoice. You clearly had an expectation that he would choose the concert and have made it in your head that he is choosing a wedding over you, but likewise he could feel you are choosing a concert over him.", "YTA-Weddings are pretty huge life events and it\u2019s a honor to be invited regardless of how often you talk to the person. I absolutely wouldn\u2019t miss a wedding I was invited to for a concert. Weddings are generally more important than a concert.\n\nYou also told him at the beginning to go regardless of if you go or not, you don\u2019t really have a great reason to be upset with him here. You guys are still independent adults, in situations like this it\u2019s ok for you guys to do your own thing separately", "Join a fan club or online community for the group you were seeing in concert. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to connect with someone to perhaps sell the other ticket to or even meet up with.", "It\u2019s not about the concert or the wedding or you. Your husband is probably feeling homesick and missing his previous life, this wedding is a chance for him to go back and connect with old friends and fill a void in his life right now. \n\nYou already mentioned that both of you currently spend most of your time together as you don\u2019t have friends in the new country, you\u2019ve become co dependant on him and I think you\u2019re hurt that he can entertain the idea of having a trip without you but you can\u2019t process going to an event without him. \n\nYou need to get out of this bubble and put effort into making a life in this new country or consider moving back to the previous country.", "Hi OP, go with your husband. How he misses his friends is needed your support such as designated driver or looking out for him. So go to the wedding with him. Also you can meet again the people that you know.\n\nSell your ticket so you have money of your own. Don't make fuss over it. He set in stone he will attend the wedding even you don't want to come.", "Before he knew about the wedding he was excited to go because you really wanted to go. Now he is being honest that he would rather go to the wedding of his friend. Gently, YTA. Especially after you told him to choose what he wants to do and he chose it. He is going to go see his friend, the one that you don't like because of drama that stirred at your wedding and quite likely the reason you don't like him is why you have talked so rarely with that friend in the past two years.\n\nDon't cage your husband. Find someone else to go to the concert with you or sell the extra ticket and go by yourself.", "Yta.", "YTA - you said your husband feels disconnected and like he\u2019s missing out since you moved but when invited back for a big event you try to explain away all the reasons he shouldnt go. \n\nAlso if he wants to attend its not to you to quantify how important his attendance should or shouldnt be to him.", "I am sorry you are hurt, but YTA.  Weddings are too important to miss if you can help it, certainly for a concert.  I get that you don't like this groom, but not liking him is not enough.  Don't be the spouse that sabotages their partner's friendships, even for this.", "YTA.\n\nHe is allowed to have friends and to attend their weddings. He doesn't have to justify his friendships or his desire to attend their big life events.\n\nA wedding trumps a concert. Period.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. You both had plans, he is not close with these people, so why would he blow you off and go to the wedding. I would be extremely upset if my husband did this to me. You are not controlling him, he is disregarding you. Apparently he is missing the action and will use any excuse to go back and have some fun. You and he both need to either make a life where you live now or move back. I would have a frank conversation with him about what is his real motivation for wanting to go.", "Yes, you are, sorry", "I would say YTA, but if he made drama at your wedding, you have the right to be mad. It's your choice.", "Why did you guys move abroad? Seems like an odd choice when your husband has fomo. Also wouldn\u2019t it be expensive to continually travel abroad? Since you said you dont have the money to fly someone out to go the the concert with you, wouldn\u2019t it be a factor that hes flying himself out and wasting the money spent on a ticket in the process?", "YTA. He feels like he's missing out on all the events in his friends lives because *he is.* You may be content to just go to a concert, but he has clearly decided that seeing a friend get married is more important than tickets to a show you can simply see later.\n\nThe wedding happens once, the concert tour may go on for years, decades if it's a younger band. Your temporal priorities are all out of whack.", "NTA. \n\nYou go to that concert and have the absolute best time of your life.", "I can tell you exactly what I think happened. You were least important compared to this so so acquaintance.  And likely any plans you two make together any other offer by a bro, he will jump at the chance to ditch plans with you over any one of them. None of those he puts first over you likely ever will put him first or help him if he needed it. But he would for them. In the long run his choice wasn\u2019t the good one for him. Because it\u2019s just a nail on his farewell box. Count on him adding more nails. Treat yourself while his gives no thought to you. Spa treatment. Whatever you desire to pamper yourself. Maybe buy something you have been putting off. Some men I hear actually get it that it\u2019s not a good idea to dump your wife over with plans made for a so called better offer. NTA.  Those who think you are must never have been ditched for somebody else. You make plans with someone. Yes, even your spouse. You don\u2019t later say sorry better offer. It\u2019s not about you wanting to control him. But actually being shown you are worthy of him respecting you enough to not put you feeling less than important.", "Sucks to be considered second choice.", "it sounds like you resent your husband, and you two don't communicate well. If you are not telling him that this makes you unhappy, clearly, it's not fair to then make that a bad thing he did. You also are saying you don't feel you have friends you can bring, but you want him to do something that will distance him from his friend forever.\n\nIt's not really about the concert, this sounds like. You should work on your relationship and stop seeking to attach blame to things.", "YTA - so your husband, who is missing his friends terribly and feels like he is missing out since moving is invited to a friends wedding and you're pissed he is prioritizing a wedding over a concert?", "I totally get your feelings over the concert. I cried everytime I've seen a band I love dearly play. It's so special. Sharing this with your SO is such a huge thing.\nHim cancelling the concert for a friend who he had only spoken to a few times in 2 years really must really hurt. I fell so sorry for you.\n\nSome people just don't get the importance of music to others and that's okay. It's okay you want to go to the concert with your husband, the person you love.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
