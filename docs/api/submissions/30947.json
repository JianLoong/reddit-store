A lot of places won\u2019t even do surgery unless you have someone there to take you home.", "NTA.\n\nBeing under anesthesia, being put to sleep, the recovery will be very rough. That\u2019s so cold of her. :(\n\nWhen I had surgery under anesthesia, I was not allowed to Uber home. It had to be a family member, or someone you know.", "NTA This is crazy, I don\u2019t know how your wife could even go on this trip without being worried sick! I would consider trying to move the trip and discuss with your wife to see what she says. If she remains firm on going that\u2019s a red flag imo.", "NTA. I'd be pretty upset if my partner prioritized a trip over helping me through a surgery.", "NTA. She can go another time. Right now, you need her. Because I can bet if the reverse was happening, she'd be crying foul the whole time.", "NTA I couldn't imagine doing that to a spouse myself. I actually took my stbxh to his surgery and brought him home and made sure he was good last week. \n\nI will say that he wouldn't have done the same for me, and he wasn't really around for any of the surgeries I had when we were together. It took me a long time to see the pattern of selfishness and one sided care in our relationship. Is this a pattern for her? Is she normally this dismissive of your needs and health? It might be time to reevaluate your relationship, or at the very least talk it through because it is incredibly selfish.", "NTA. Is her insistence on going related to your child and school vacation? I can see how a limited window is there for the trip and maybe having the place to yourself without having to worry about parenting could be good? It\u2019s a bit hard to make a judgment without understanding the broader context of your relationship and lifestyle, and personally Id probably be fine with this situation. But NTA for finding it selfish of her.", "NTA\n\nIf my partner chooses to go on vacation when im having surgery and will be under full anesthesia , i would be done with him.", "Question, what\u2019s the surgery for?", "NTA. I'm rabidly independent, and find your wife's priorities disappointing.", "NTA sorry man she doesn't love you, you are a wallet to that woman", "I had my 4 wisdom teeth pulled on a Friday where my wife was scheduled to visit her sister out of town that weekend with our two kids. \n\nI was also put under anesthesia because two of the teeth were impacted and they had to do some serious drill work.\n\nShe transported me home, then I encouraged her to visit her sister while I recovered at home. I did not have limited mobility, and I had the new season of Stranger Things to keep my company, which I binge watched all weekend.\n\nIt wasn't the end of the world. I guess I'd be curious to know why this trip is so important to her?\n\nINFO: Does she have a successful job or other living conditions that she REALLY needs a break from? Would she have an opportunity for another trip of this nature if she were to cancel this one to nurse you?", "What is the point of even having a wife?\n\nNTA.", "NTA your wife sounds like a selfish person, just let show her this Reddit post and she can see what people think of her selfish attitude herself and if that doesn\u2019t help her see that she\u2019s in the wrong then just remember this for whenever she needs support of some kind is all I can set tbh.", "She's going to cheat lol", "Obviously hearing your side, your are NTA. But there\u2019s 2 sides to every story. We don\u2019t know how you treat your wife. Or how often she gets vacation. So I can\u2019t just side with you. But if it\u2019s all happy and dandy, then she has issues. \nI wouldn\u2019t never be away from my man especially if he was having surgery or even a doctors visit. \nI even sit in the car while he gets his teeth cleaned..", "Sounds like an elective surgery. If you are able, reschedule.", "Ouch!!! That must really hurt you emotionally. \nI don't even know what to say......I hope you have a cute nurse that can come help you out...", "Mmmmm.

I missed my best friend's wedding so I could be at his side...even though his parents and brother were nearby. I cannot imagine going on a vacation while my husband was under anesthesia. Complications are rare, but not unheard of, and you'll need help after surgery. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIs there something deeper going on? Is she super mad at you about something? Or thinking you're overreacting to whatever your health issue is (I am **not** saying you are, just wondering if she might think that)? I wouldn't so much as leave the hospital while my husband had general anesthesia, let alone leaving the state. \n\nThe hospital will likely not let you Uber home.

I'm guessing hernia repair? Dude, get a divorce", "NTA", "NTA but your wife sure is!", "NTA\n\nAre you kidding me! My wife had a minor procedure done, outpatient, but it did require lots of rest for the week after in order to heal properly. \n\nI took the week off for family medical leave, I was basically at her side for that entire week. I would have accepted no other scenario and definitely wouldn't be going on a vacation. \n\nDoes your wife even like you? I'd be taking this very seriously.", "NTA.  There are some really awful stories in here, but your wife wins.  She\u2019s the most selfish person I\u2019ve read about in a long time.  I hope you can find someone who actually gives a f about you to be there for you after your surgery.", "Wow just wow. What a selfish person to still think of going.", "NTA. That's is spectacularly selfish of her. Even if it's routine surgery, it's still *surgery.* As others have pointed out hospitals wont even release you unless you have someone to watch you after being under general anesthesia. \n\nWhat even is the point of relationships if you're not going to support each other.", "I just can\u2019t imagine that someone would prioritize a holiday over taking care of their partner, if there wouldn\u2019t be a very good reason for doing so. What is her rationale behind this choice? \n\nHas she been urging you to seek help for months, and now all of a sudden you plan it in the middle of your already scheduled holiday? Do you have a habit of doing your own thing at the expense of family plans? Have holiday plans been cancelled before because of you? \n\nBased on the info provided, NTA. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if we are missing some important context here that may change my opinion.", "Why didn\u2019t you schedule after the trip ?", "NTA, do you have a group family chat, ask for volunteers to stay with you as your wife can\u2019t be bothered.", "NTA  If your wife can't be there when you need her what do you need her for? So you can be shown again her disrespect and uncaring attitude towards you? Once should be enough.", "No no NTA.

Others, I'd tell you to suck it up, buttercup.", "Doesn't matter the point is you're not supposed to be on your own after general anaesthetic", "I think this post is specifically missing that info because the verdicts would change immediately if he said what it was for.  It can\u2019t be *too* emergent if the surgery is two months from now.", "Probably gallbladder removal. I lived with the pain for two years before getting insurance to have it removed. \n\nIt\u2019s a pretty routine procedure and outpatient. Depending on how bad his gall bladder is (if that\u2019s what the surgery is for) there is a chance his liver could be nicked and he would have to have a drain. Which does limit mobility somewhat. I couldn\u2019t stand up fully straight, or take a real shower.\n\nThat\u2019s not mentioning pain killers they prescribe and if I remember correctly, some kind of diet for a few days. \n\nRecovery time is pretty quick and the only pain I had was the drain. As soon as that was taken out, I was immediately pain free. It\u2019s a faster recovery time w/o the drain. \n\nBut he\u2019s NTA for wanting his wife to postpone the trip and be with him. Even routine procedures can go wrong. I would not go on any trip, or to work if the father of my child was undergoing any type of surgery.", "I guess technically it is elective, although I have to deal with significant pain and discomfort until I have surgery and 4-6 weeks of recovery. And the earliest surgery date I could get when I scheduled it in early November was in January - and I took the second available date since the first available date would have conflicted with a girl's trip she has planned.", "100%, you couldn\u2019t pay me to leave my husbands side for nearly anything but I can\u2019t help but wonder what the issue is and why the surgery needs to be done right then. His wife seems pretty cavalier about it.", "Not necessarily true. My mom had to wait almost 2 months to get urgent brain surgery to fix 3 aneurysms that were on the verge of bursting. Her doctor considered it an emergency but couldn\u2019t get it scheduled sooner.", "Eh, that\u2019s not a fair judgment. It may not be immediate life and death, but it can still be a big deal. \n\nMy dad just scheduled back surgery for January. He\u2019s in quite a bit of pain, so I don\u2019t think he would delay the surgery to go on a weekend trip. No, he\u2019s not going to die from his back problem, but he definitely wants it fixed ASAP.", "That makes your wife's decision to go on the January trip anyway even more assholish.", "Wow so you already took a later date so she could go on an optional trip..?? Man, looks like that was for nothing. Can you call and see if they have any other earlier dates available still?\n\nYour wife majorly sucks for prioritizing FL over you. She needs to get her head on straight."]}
