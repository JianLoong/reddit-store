Where I\u2019m from if surgery is needed you get the date scheduled while at the dr and it\u2019s the first available date,  you\u2019re not given different options to choose when to have it - I was clarifying regarding that. My take is that either the wife thinks it\u2019s not serious enough to cancel the holiday or she\u2019s just being flippant . Like either it\u2019s bad and she doesn\u2019t really care or she\u2019s somehow believing it\u2019s not bad enough to warrant canceling her trip.", "In his replies he says that this is actually the second available date, he pushed the surgery back to allow her to go on a girl's trip she had planned so regardless of how she's seeing it in her head, she's a trash spouse who cares more about taking trips than her husband."]}
