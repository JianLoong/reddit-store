She said I told her I only kissed her (which I was sure I told her that I slept with her).  Ultimately I apologised as I hadn\u2019t told her the full story and we moved on it was fine. We had a productive discussion talking about anyone else we were seeing/sleeping with when we first started things casually. She said she went on a date with a guy named Mike but it didn\u2019t go well and nothing happened between them at all. I explained the only girl I slept with was my coworker. \nAnyways, just after Christmas last year I could tell she was hiding texting someone. I wanted to give her the time to deal with whatever it was and then come forward about it.\nBut she didn\u2019t. I always want to respect her privacy. But there is a difference between privacy and secrecy. And this was the latter. I went through her phone while she was in the shower. I saw she had messages from an email address on her phone.

You are not mature enough to trust your partner, and she is not mature enough to tell the truth.

It takes a lot to bring a sane person to the edge, so they would do that (assuming you are no control freak, which you don\u00b4t seem to be). I admitted my privacy breach and called them out. We were both glad I did, because this gave us the opportunity to work things out and re-build trust.

You didn't, and, frankly, you didn't even discover anything particularly damning. \n\nShe shouldn't be lying about past relationships (especially if she's going to call you out on the same), but that doesn't excuse or justify snooping on her phone.
