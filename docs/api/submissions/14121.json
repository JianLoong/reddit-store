I think your mom might be taking things personally because you're a much better mother to your daugter than she ever was to you.", "NTA\n\nUnacceptable from the daycare, that was dangerous and unprofessional from a service you are paying for. There's no defending them.\n\nYour mother sounds annoying and sensitive, a bad combination. At this point with your mother, just tell her less to nothing.", "nta\n\nmake a report now this is serious \n\nwhat if a child has medical needs \n\nthis needs to be taken serious get it in writing , go to the local council", "NTA on both counts.  Your mom raised you, she should trust you to raise your daughter.\n\nThe daycare is negligent to have not fed your daughter for 6 1/2 hours.  Kids of that age eat every 2 hours or so.  I would make sure they  have a corrective action plan in place to make sure it never happens again.", "NTA, file a report so the daycare can change their routines. Both daycares we had our girls in when they were little had a chart by the door where they wrote down which hours every kid had slept and how much they had eaten during the day. So beside asking about the day when we picked them up we could also see for ourselves how the basics had been during the day.", "\u201cShe got mad at that remark and called it unnecessary.\u201d\n\nIf your remark was unnecessary, so was hers.\n\nI\u2019m furious at your daycare.

The whole though love, let the baby cry until they calm down is something so cruel in my opinion and also just straight up dumb, a baby won't cry unless they have a problem even if it's just for attention or for some love. Your children listening to you also starts with you giving everything they when they are baby actually.\n\nFor the part what you said to your mother I think you can be justified, just because it's your mother she can't accept you not getting angry if she's stupid enough to say stuff like this, also what goes around comes around.", "NTA, why did your mother get mad? If your young child is fine not to be fed for so long then she would be too right?\n\nThe system your daycare has is dangerous. If a child with hypoglycaemia or diabetes hadn't been fed they could have had life-altering consequences or even a death.", "NTA\n\nAlso, report the centre.

By So Much.\nI even got angry just reading your post. Not feeding a six months old for six hours?! I'd be livid, the poor baby!\n\nOk, so maybe your comments to your mother were a little too much, but I can imagine loosing my cool in such a situation and won't blame you for it. Plus, you're not wrong and I hope your mother realises she's going to apply those double standards when she needs similar care to a baby but expects better treatment than what she thinks a baby deserves.", "NTA.

That is neglect no matter how you slice it!  I would file a complaint/report for the neglwct to your baby.  As far as your mom goes LC or NC for thinking this is ok.", "ETA. You are TA only for saying such rude things to your mother. She was TA and wrong while you are absolutely right to expect your child to be fed on time. Although it sounds like your mom deserved what you said, it was better left unsaid. Both of you needlessly escalated the situation. When someone is rude to you, just walk away.", "My toddler, three times that age, needs to be fed more often than that! He's on I think four meals and two snacks per day - breakfast, lunch, afternoonses, something to graze on, dinner, bedtime yoghurt. I'm not 100% sure about his food schedule at daycare, but he always gets lunch at least. (I can often see the evidence on his shirt \ud83d\ude06)", "They have an app actually. They use iPads to write everything down. It was because those systems went down that everything went haywire and chaos ensued. For me it was the feeding but they couldn\u2019t tell the mother of another boy if her son had received his seizure medication.", "The answer to the first question \u00dc asked is yes", "The key piece of information here is that feeding is the only way they also get water and hydration. So do you think a 6-month-old being should go that long without water?\n\nThat's the answer to the question on whether or not it's harmful. Many adults don't go 6 hours comfortably without water.", "Are you being serious?", "OP doesn't hint at spoiling her child, she says her mother  thinks so. Her mother also thinks the daycare wasn't badly in the wrong.", "This is a 6 month old, it is NOT \"spoiling\" a baby to attend to their needs.", "One more thing! Your mum is entitled, selfish, and immature.", "Then they need to update their backup-system so their prepared if the app goes down again.

Do that then tell me you wan to put your child in that environment?\nAbsolutely nothing bad to say about the workers. They love kids and do their best. But they are under resourced and underpaid", "That ship has well and truly sailed, and I waved it off without a tear. Who the hell are you to say that women are bad mothers because they need to work to feed their children?", "Never said that Pix. \nBut the sector as it is atm is atrocious. \nWe should be demanding a better system.

You said (granted, I'm paraphrasing a little) that if you wanted you child to be looked after, then their mother's should be looking after them and not putting them into daycare.", "I haven\u2019t deleted any comment Pix?\nYou can read all my comments so no need to \u2018paraphrase\u2019 anything I say.", "It must have been reported then.
