I sent her the money I owed through venmo and she proceeds to get mad at me and says \"i was having a good day but now my day is ruined because of this\", her main point is that I never listen to her (she said she'll send a venmo request, but instead I went ahead and sent her the money myself).\n\nShe also got mad about the fact that I updated both her and my financial expense tracking spreadsheet that I created for us. I just added an entry for the ticket cost and she got mad at me for updating hers (she has never told me not to touch hers).\n\nI don't get it. Isn't this something that for normal adults is not a big deal at all? I'm 24, she's 22. I'm so lost as to if what I did really deserves all that anger and blame for ruining her day.\n\nEdit: let me clarify on the excel sheet since some people think I'm recording all her expenses for her, or in forcing her to do it. She talks about wanting to save more money cus she recently had a big move, and I suggested what if a I create an excel tracker with charts and stuff for that. She agreed that's a good idea and I made it last week. Theres a column for me and column for her. I never touched her numbers or asked Her to record this or that.

I question the need for one adult to track the expenses of another adult especially down to that level. If she has an issue with overspending and she genuinely asked you to help that's one thing. Otherwise it's infantalizing and controlling. There are apps that track ones individual expenses. If she can cover her own share of things and is able to still save something, she doesn't need you to do it for her. When I was 22 I was definitely not looking for a guy to tell me how I could spend my own money. I never would have pooled my money with someone I wasn't even married to.

I don't understand why you'd have to wait for her request to come through if she sent you the receipt and you had the money ready to go. I can't understand how that would \"ruin her day\" just because she told you she's send a request.\n\nYou're definitely the asshole, however, for messing with her expense tracking sheet. Even if you created it, it's hers to update. She's an adult. It's not something she needed to ask you *not* to do; you don't touch someone else's financial records unless specifically asked to do so.", "NTA for forwarding the money.

Quite simple.  You took control which she didn't like.  She is just standing up for herself and if you consistently ignore her requests, particularly over money, I am not surprised she lost her rag at you.  The clue is, she told you, you don't listen, and you aren't now, instead you are parading around telling everyone how efficient you are with IT and accounting software, ignoring your girlfriend's request, and making a shocked pikachu face about how cross she is with you.  YTA  ten times over.\n\nIt is also quite pathetic that you are trying to gaslight reddit users into supporting you over being a complete AH.
