Good god, children don\u2019t get everything in this world. It was incredibly obnoxious for her to even ask you for it.

This one, and your souvenirs-are *yours.* NTA", "NTA, I'm a parent as well, but nothing irritates me more than parents that think the world revolves around their children. Enjoy the set list and paraphernalia you got, and don't feel bad about it. The mom will get over it.

I remember stories from before social media (yes, the dark ages!) about adults who would send their kids to beg for foul balls at baseball games and then keep it for themselves.  I have seen too many people use kids as fronts to pull off scams of various types to be swayed by a strange kid.  Even if the mother and child are legit, his enthusiasm might have a very short expiration date.  He may be tired of the band by next weekend.  Your happiness and well being are every bit as valid as that child's.", "NTA i feel bad for the kid but on the other hand you paid extra, had to stand there longer, worked for it and got it. incredibly bold and rude for her to ask you to give them up lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
