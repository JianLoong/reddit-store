People who love him develop ways to tell him to cut it off when it's annoying. You have a nice way,  his friends have a not-so- nice way, but all of you like him anyway.  It doesn't sound like your husband minds how his friends talk to HIM. \n\nHowever, his friends didn't realize that the same kind of asshole jokes that are fine between friends are NOT fine when your son is involved.  You were absolutely right to speak up. \n\nMy experience is that people without kids sometimes don't think of little kids as real people. To the friend your son was just a cute prop for a joke, which again,  SUCKS and is not right.  Rather than forever ban him, though, I think it would be better to directly and clearly call out the behavior and explain exactly why it's not ok.  Then,  if they apologize and don't do it again,  everything is fine.  If they don't,  then yeah,  ban them.", "NTA.\n\nNah fuck that.

Your husband's friends are cruel people. I bet your husband is quiet right now because he realizes his friends are AHs, not because he's mad at you. You did the right thing by sticking up for your husband and drawing boundaries for how they interact with your kid.\n\nTheir response to realizing they'd crossed a boundary was to double down and call you hysterical instead of apologizing like normal people would do. \n\nYou haven't ruined anything. The AHs are the ones who ruined it.\n\nNTA", "You are so NTA. You left the decision of your husband's friends behavior rightfully up to your husband to address up until they tried to teach your child to mock his own father. That is not amusing. You nipped that situation right in the bud, just as you should have.", "You had every right to shut that down. You don\u2019t use someone\u2019s child against them that\u2019s messed up.

This has been bothering *you* for a while, but it sounds like you only brought it up to your husband (which is appropriate!) and not him.\n\nI\u2019d suggest backing off the permanent ban and instead text them and say it always bothered you how they said shut up to your husband, and that they really crossed a line telling a toddler to emulate them.
