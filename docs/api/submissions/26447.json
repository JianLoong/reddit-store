The area where we were walking in is known for its pickpockets and thieves and actually the day prior I had my phone stolen from me.\n\nSo I approached the lost looking girl and said \"excuse me are you okay, you need to be really careful going down this street because thieves operate in numbers\". She said \"fuck off, I have a boyfriend I'm not interested\" so I was like \"My phone was stolen yesterday, I'm only trying to tell you both to be careful here\", to which she replied \"I told you to fuck off\", so I left it at that. It was a genuine attempt to help, not to chat them up.\n\nAfter grabbing a quick bite, I went back into the club with my friend and before going in at the corner of my eye I saw the same girl withdrawing money from the ATM with some guy standing behind her, I didn't think anything of it and just went in.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, my other friend who was still in the club said he wasn't feeling well so we decided to take him back to the hotel. On the way out I saw that same girl in tears pleading with that same guy about a necklace. Passing her, I asked \"what happened?\" and she said that this guy took her necklace without her even realising and he won't give it back. In fact, he was completely unfazed by her pleas. My best friend and I instantly burst out laughing because of the interaction we had not too long ago. Her friend instantly reacted and said \"why is that funny? that necklace means a lot to her because her father gave it and he's dead now\". I said \"well I'm sorry to hear that but we literally warned you both and you told us to fuck off twice\" and she rolled her eyes, then we walked away. She shouted \"assholes\" while her friend continued to plead with the shady guy.\n\nWe told the story to our friend (who wasn't well) the next morning and he said yeah she was actually the asshole, we're not assholes for laughing because we tried to warn them and then karma struck. I feel bad for laughing in her face given the sentimental reason, but we didn't know and we found the events leading up to the event funny.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1694168730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16d6til/aita_for_laughing_at_a_girl_who_got_her_necklace/", "score": 1432, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get that you didn't realize this was a sentimental necklace from her late father, but either way you sound like a \"nice guy\" who was super offended that a strange woman didn't listen to you. So then you were essentially celebrating that she got robbed as karma.", "This is the fakest thing I've ever read on here lmfao", "Wait, the thief was hanging around after stealing the necklace? What?", "You warned her, but realistically speaking, what she could have done to avoid this situation other than leaving the place immediately? It's not like she did something that triggered someone to steal from her, criminals are opportunistic. They saw something they could take and took it.\n\nIn other hand, your approach was interpreted as an unwelcome advance, which was quite an assumption, but honestly not far fetched. \n\nI'll go with ESH. Yes, she was rude AF, but it's nothing to be laughing at. Maybe shrug and move on, but acting as if she deserved is victim blaming - her rudeness to you has nothing to do with what happened to her.", "YTA. You sound like a dude who has no business talking to women. No one cares for your unsolicited advice even if you mean well. She clearly thinks you\u2019re trying to hit on her, so leave her alone.", "OP, you\u2019re such a massive asshole it\u2019s not even funny.\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t know what your intentions were when you initially came up to her. Idk why men don\u2019t understand this, but men come up to women ALL OF THE TIME with so called \u201cgood intentions\u201d as an excuse to talk to us. And btw, it\u2019s a common tactic for thieves who operate in groups to have one person distract the victim while the others rob them. You should know this, since your so well-versed in the way of the world. \n\nLaughing in someone\u2019s face is always a bad look regardless of the situation. Do you know what a mature reaction would have been? It would have been for you to have given her the space she asked for initially and then not responded to her distress later. You got offended by someone because the told you to \u201cf off\u201d and then rejoiced in their sorrow later. Is \u201cf off\u201d a nice thing to say? Not really, no. But does that make your laughter later justified? No. Your response is purely ego driven and it calls into question your altruistic motives in the first place.\n\nI get it. People sometimes don\u2019t heed my advice and then suffer consequences for it. But the only thoughts that run through my mind are \u201cOh well.\u201d I don\u2019t rejoice in their suffering because these are people that I care about. And if you say that you don\u2019t owe it to her to care about her because she was a stranger, I\u2019ll remind you that it nullifies any moral high ground you felt about going out of your way to give her advice in the first place.\n\nHere\u2019s another way of looking at it more simply: when deciding whether to say something to someone (and I would include laughing in this piece of advice as well), it should be at least 2 of 3 things - true, kind, helpful.\n\nWas it true that she ignored your advice? Maybe. You don\u2019t know. Maybe she took off her necklace but the thief took it out of her purse.\n\nWas laughing at her while she was distress kind? No.\n\nWas it helpful? What do you think?\n\nEdit: YTA", "YTA. The problem I have with this subreddit is that there are so many posts like yours where people think that someone being rude to you means you no longer have to be a decent human being. The fact that you can't tell the difference between being rude and laughing at someone who has been victimized makes me wonder if you have some kind of cognitive impairment.\n\nBeing a good man is something you do and something you are, regardless of how someone treats you, and all the men making excuses for you because this girl hurt your feelings are why modern men are such spineless limpdicks. A girl is crying in front of you because she's been robbed, and you laughed at her because she hurt your feelings.

It was callous and cruel to someone who was just mugged.\n\nShe is also an asshole for telling you to fuck off, though it is perhaps a bit understandable as a group of strange, sober men approaching a pair of young, tipsy, and confused women outside a club at night is unlikely to be operating altruistically.

It's usually better to mind your own business unless someone is truly in immediate danger or super clearly needs help. Looking confused doesn't really qualify.

OP already painted a big enough picture that you can safely guess that he coerced the girls into taking money out of the ATM.
