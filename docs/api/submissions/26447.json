I was with my best friend and we were walking to get some food when I saw this girl looking lost while her friend seemed pretty confused (probably tipsy) and they were not even watchful of their surroundings. The area where we were walking in is known for its pickpockets and thieves and actually the day prior I had my phone stolen from me.\n\nSo I approached the lost looking girl and said \"excuse me are you okay, you need to be really careful going down this street because thieves operate in numbers\". She said \"fuck off, I have a boyfriend I'm not interested\" so I was like \"My phone was stolen yesterday, I'm only trying to tell you both to be careful here\", to which she replied \"I told you to fuck off\", so I left it at that. It was a genuine attempt to help, not to chat them up.\n\nAfter grabbing a quick bite, I went back into the club with my friend and before going in at the corner of my eye I saw the same girl withdrawing money from the ATM with some guy standing behind her, I didn't think anything of it and just went in.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, my other friend who was still in the club said he wasn't feeling well so we decided to take him back to the hotel. On the way out I saw that same girl in tears pleading with that same guy about a necklace. Passing her, I asked \"what happened?\" and she said that this guy took her necklace without her even realising and he won't give it back. In fact, he was completely unfazed by her pleas. My best friend and I instantly burst out laughing because of the interaction we had not too long ago. Her friend instantly reacted and said \"why is that funny? that necklace means a lot to her because her father gave it and he's dead now\". I said \"well I'm sorry to hear that but we literally warned you both and you told us to fuck off twice\" and she rolled her eyes, then we walked away. She shouted \"assholes\" while her friend continued to plead with the shady guy.\n\nWe told the story to our friend (who wasn't well) the next morning and he said yeah she was actually the asshole, we're not assholes for laughing because we tried to warn them and then karma struck. I feel bad for laughing in her face given the sentimental reason, but we didn't know and we found the events leading up to the event funny.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1694168730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16d6til/aita_for_laughing_at_a_girl_who_got_her_necklace/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
