After dinner we usually take an hour or two to relax, play some games, chat, before my brother and his wife go on their way.\n\nThe last couple visits my brother has been making use of my chess board. He plays with Brandon and constantly fumbles to let him win. (Stuff like leaving his queen wide open to be taken. Come on now).\n\nI was distraught at the false sense of confidence my brother was giving Brandon. I told him he'll never improve if he doesn't challenge him, but my brother says they're just having fun. He literally lets Brandon make illegal moves (doesn't even understand the correct way to move the knight) and doesn't correct him \n\nLast week they came over and after dinner Brandon heads straight for the chess board, but this time, I sat across the board from him before my brother could.\n\nIt was an absolute slaughter. this kid could barely make two moves without me taking a piece from him. And every time he tried to make an illegal move I just said \"nope\" and made him put it back.\n\nTo state the obvious, I won the game in record time. Brandon looked pretty sad and left to go hug his mom. My brother tells me that was a dick move and I should have let him win. I told him I'm undefeated in my household and I'm not about to let a 6 year old break my win streak. I told him his son had to learn sooner or later how to actually play and that the reason he reacted so poorly to losing is because he's raising him as a snowflake.\n\nThey left and still haven't made plans to come over this week, which is unusual.\n\nAITA for teaching my nephew a lesson about winning/losing and not bowing to the social pressure to lose on purpose to a child?\n\nEdit:\nA bunch of people are asking me if I feel proud or accomplished about beating a 6-year-old at chess. You're missing the point. The winning was inevitable, that wasn't why I did it. The goal was to deflate his false sense of accomplishment that he hadn't earned. I think he'll look back on our game as a turning in his life when he starts to understand that nobody is going to give him handouts in the real world", "created_utc": 1674847957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mtqn9/aita_for_decimating_my_6_year_old_nephew_at_chess/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have been kind about teaching him to make legal moves and taught him how to play properly.

Gross.", "YTA and BOY did you miss out on a chance to be the cool aunt or uncle.\n\nChess is supposed to be fun. You had the opportunity to make it fun by teaching Brandon -- who is SIX -- how to play chess well. Crushing him creates no opportunities for learning or fun. Going \"NOPE\" and moving a piece back creates no opportunities for learning or fun. Defending your \"win streak\" FROM A SIX YEAR OLD creates no opportunities for learning or fun.\n\nI saw a great technique just this week on this very board -- I believe a granddad taught his grandkids to play, but the deal was the kids could rotate the board at any time. It meant the kid could easily get out of bad situations (that were of their own making) AND it was more fun for the granddad because he was kept on his toes and was essentially playing himself (or a really terrible version of himself). \n\nBut no.

Not for beating him, but for \"decimating\" and \"slaughtering\" him. When he moved a piece wrong, did you try to teach him how to move it right? Or did you just, as you said, move the piece back and tell him \"nope\"? When my little cousin was seven she was very interested in chess. I was the best player in my immediate family, though none of us were that good. When I played her, I took her apart slowly and made sure that she always had a touch of hope. I did the same with her sister a year or two later. They are both in the chess club now, 12 and 10, and they could tear me apart without a struggle. That's because I and the rest of my family made sure not to ruin the fun of chess even when we beat them. Sounds like you ruined the fun of chess for your nephew. It's like you forgot it's meant to be a game.", "YTA yay look at me I made a 6 year sad by being massive dick.", "YTA- as a person who works with kids, there\u2019s a way to do this that makes you NTA. Next time, you should offer that you and Brandon can play his dad as a team. And as you go, you can explain to Brandon what you are doing and why and ask him what he might do if the roles were reversed. It\u2019s really that simple. THATS how people learn. Not by being humiliated. You can repair this, if you want to.

After dinner we usually take an hour or two to relax, play some games, chat, before my brother and his wife go on their way.\n\nThe last couple visits my brother has been making use of my chess board. He plays with Brandon and constantly fumbles to let him win. (Stuff like leaving his queen wide open to be taken. Come on now).\n\nI was distraught at the false sense of confidence my brother was giving Brandon. I told him he'll never improve if he doesn't challenge him, but my brother says they're just having fun. He literally lets Brandon make illegal moves (doesn't even understand the correct way to move the knight) and doesn't correct him \n\nLast week they came over and after dinner Brandon heads straight for the chess board, but this time, I sat across the board from him before my brother could.\n\nIt was an absolute slaughter. this kid could barely make two moves without me taking a piece from him. And every time he tried to make an illegal move I just said \"nope\" and made him put it back.\n\nTo state the obvious, I won the game in record time. Brandon looked pretty sad and left to go hug his mom. My brother tells me that was a dick move and I should have let him win. I told him I'm undefeated in my household and I'm not about to let a 6 year old break my win streak. I told him his son had to learn sooner or later how to actually play and that the reason he reacted so poorly to losing is because he's raising him as a snowflake.\n\nThey left and still haven't made plans to come over this week, which is unusual.\n\nAITA for teaching my nephew a lesson about winning/losing and not bowing to the social pressure to lose on purpose to a child?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good lord man. Playing with children means being a bit flexible. You didn\u2019t challenge him, you took advantage of the fact that the child didn\u2019t have the knowledge that you, a fully grown in body but not emotions person, did and killed any fun he was having. \n\nYou could have corrected the illegal moves without being a d*ck.

Children fantasize and play pretend. My friend's son knows that he is not actually Spider-Man but it gives him great joy to pretend.

I mean, becoming a doctor requires many years of education and   residency.  Kids can't just go around calling them doctors, right?", "It's easy to destroy a 6 year olds fun, but why would you want to kill his joy in something? I suspect your nephew is more mature than you are.", "You're really immature. The way you are talking about knocking this 6 year old \"down a few pegs\" and being affronted at his unearned use of the term grand master,  it just sounds like you're reacting as you would if he were an actual adult.\n\nHe's 6, and his Dad isn't teaching him the rules; he legitimately doesn't have a good baseline for knowing he hasn't actually been earning his wins. So how is he supposed to know he's not a grand master? For that matter, he's still the age where kids declare themselves superheroes and kings and ninjas and power rangers; you ought to be thrilled he rates \"grand master\" so highly in his own kid way.\n\nYour response was disproportionate and cruel.
