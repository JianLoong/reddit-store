You had every right to be informed of your diagnosis and that you were prescribed medication that she stopped abruptly. It sounds like your mother is dismissive and diminishing. I wouldn\u2019t worry about what your family thinks. Instead, I would talk to a doctor about whether or not you need a new diagnosis and if medication would be right for you. Many adults are absolutely relieved to get help for their ADHD, once they can take charge of their own health and treatment. Once you start getting some support and strategies, you can let them know what they should have done for you! They took the lazy way out by expecting you to will yourself out of a neurological disorder.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry this happened.  \nI totally understand that you are angry with her. It seems like she never took your diagnosis seriously. Would she tell someone with depression to just smile more and take a walk around to feel better?\n\nI understand that it feels like you are speaking bad of her now but in my opinion this is not speaking badly but standing up for yourself.

Also, withdrawal is a bitch on those medications and having a diagnosis literally helps so much.", "NTA, and as a fellow ADHD - hugs! Your mother has done you meaningful harm, and I'm not sure your relationship can recover until she admits that (to you and herself). \n\nSO many of us were told \"it's not a real illness\" \"you're just lazy\" etc that we develop something called \"rejection sensitive dysphoria\" which is basically being hypersensitive to (perceived) rejection. It takes years of work to uproot those negative thoughts and reactions, and there she was, all those years, too pig-ignorant and ableist to learn how to raise you without hurting you. \n\nDid you know there are a whole host of coping strategies that work *with* your brain and aren't medication? Does she? She should have! She could have made sure you were taught them, and you deserved that from your parent(s).\n\nI was raised by a parent who didn't get it and a parent with undiagnosed ADHD themself. They didn't know, and they did their best, but I'm *still* angry with them both in different ways about how much easier they could have made my life, and how much work I could have *not* had to do to get rid of the mess they left.\n\nAnyone saying \"forgive her\" should understand that the kind of harm she was doing was on the level of slapping you every time you didn't finish work by bedtime because \"it's the only way they'll learn\".

And you said a very good point. Why didn't she help you instead of calling you lazy?\n\nMy son has ADHD, and yes, everything is hard. Playing (he gets too excited), reading, writing, counting... But it is our role as parents to help him. It is hard, depending on how tired he is, but he needs us. We both have demanding jobs and other children, so it's our role to find time for him.\n\nWhen I see how sensitive our kid is, how much he needs patient adults around him, and how distressed he can become if he fails sometimes, I can't imagine growing up hearing you're just lazy, and basically not good enough.\n\nI don't think your mother can realize that (some people just don't believe in neurodivergence).

And in fact, you actually describe many ADHD symptoms in her - the not letting you get a word in edgewise.  She also sounds childish and impulsive if she thinks it's was funny with your grades.  Again all can point to ADHD in her.\n\nBut quite frankly I would be cutting her off in some respects and not telling her any more of your medical journey.\n\nIt may be eye opening to have you medicated to help with that focus and who knows what you will do.  Consider going to back to school (medicated) and achieving what you never thought you could.  Then you can give your mother the big proverbial middle finger when you achieve your dreams.\n\nShe has not helped you at all and doesn't really deserve to be included in your successes.\n\nShe perhaps should consider a diagnosis herself.\n\nYou can't change the past but you sure can help control your future and guide it the way you want to.  You are young even if you don't think you are.  You've got the world at your feet and so much better that you found this out at 23 rather than 63.  Your mom may have missed her diagnosis but it doesn't mean you can't get yourself sorted.", "NTA. That's medical negligence. As someone who wasn't diagnosed autistic until I was 19 despite my mum trying from the age of 3 (AFAB people tend to get ignored when it comes to ASD/ADHD) my school life was hell and accommodations would have prevented burnout and poor qualifications. The fact that your issues were recognised and she decided she knew more than your doctor is medical negligence and that is NOT okay, nor is it your fault for struggling. Being ND is NOT being \"lazy\". There are a lot of support groups online if you want support. Many AFAB people have been through something similar, which I know doesn't make what you went through any less traumatic, but you will be able to find support. \u2764", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hoping you get your answers and smooth sailing from here on out!", "Yep, mostly the stress/anxiety side is my issue, had a feeling that would probably not change regardless of Adderall or Vyvanse :-) \n\nThanks for sharing your experience!", "I have an appointment for it in two weeks(doctor is pretty booked up) so I apologize for looking into all of these new terms and things I hadn\u2019t really dealt with before that are helping me make sense of things.", "And then she mocked you for doing poorly in school, when she is the person who had the information as to WHY you were doing poorly in school and refused to help or even inform you!", "That's such a common ADHD experience. I'm sorry you've felt like that for so long. You're not a bad person, you just need a different approach to things. Start researching ADHD and so many things will become clear it's crazy.", "As someone who discovered I had ADHD at age 38, the biggest revelation has been that I'd wrongfully internalized this idea that I'm lazy, and so much I've done in my life has been my effort to disprove that. I can only imagine how different my life would have been if I'd known about my ADHD from childhood. You have missed out on a lot but you are still young. You got through school and that's all that matters. Grades don't matter anymore, diplomas do. You can get on medication now if you want and you can create an amazing ADHD life. Feed your strengths and passions to find a career you love. You are not and never were lazy, you just had a chemical imbalance! (Don't we all nowadays, LOL)", "Have a look at the reading list, and the Out of the FOG website.\n\nSorry hun but, a mother who can't be bothered to pursue treatment for her child's diagnosed ADHD, and *then berates that child for the direct consequences of her inaction*, is almost certainly a narcissist.", "You\u2019re welcome!\n\nThe tone of your comment seemed fine to me. It makes sense to be, perhaps, hesitant or unsure when presented with that kind of possible label for someone in your family.", "Theres this channel called how to adhd that gives good info. I would just advise to be skeptical of info from random tiktoks/instagram reels but overall there's a lot of good information online about symptoms. For example I learned some good tips for how to actually listen when people talk to me instead of zoning out.", "I felt the same when I learned this! I struggled with severe depression for years, only to learn it not only was exasperated by my ADHD, but could have been caused by it! That was a shock.", "It's rough to realize, but that's two years of your life that your mum basically stole from you. That's the sinister nature of mental health denialists. Formative years are stolen AND you're looked down upon for being a black sheep of sorts. Praying for you OP!", "Okay good! I struggle both in typed and spoken format with tones/understanding them or using proper cadence at times so I tend to over explain, I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t come across as ungrateful for the resource."]}
