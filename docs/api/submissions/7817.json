You had every right to be informed of your diagnosis and that you were prescribed medication that she stopped abruptly. It sounds like your mother is dismissive and diminishing. I wouldn\u2019t worry about what your family thinks. Instead, I would talk to a doctor about whether or not you need a new diagnosis and if medication would be right for you. Many adults are absolutely relieved to get help for their ADHD, once they can take charge of their own health and treatment. Once you start getting some support and strategies, you can let them know what they should have done for you! They took the lazy way out by expecting you to will yourself out of a neurological disorder.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry this happened.  \nI totally understand that you are angry with her. It seems like she never took your diagnosis seriously. Would she tell someone with depression to just smile more and take a walk around to feel better?\n\nI understand that it feels like you are speaking bad of her now but in my opinion this is not speaking badly but standing up for yourself.

Also, withdrawal is a bitch on those medications and having a diagnosis literally helps so much.", "NTA, and as a fellow ADHD - hugs! Your mother has done you meaningful harm, and I'm not sure your relationship can recover until she admits that (to you and herself). \n\nSO many of us were told \"it's not a real illness\" \"you're just lazy\" etc that we develop something called \"rejection sensitive dysphoria\" which is basically being hypersensitive to (perceived) rejection. It takes years of work to uproot those negative thoughts and reactions, and there she was, all those years, too pig-ignorant and ableist to learn how to raise you without hurting you. \n\nDid you know there are a whole host of coping strategies that work *with* your brain and aren't medication? Does she? She should have! She could have made sure you were taught them, and you deserved that from your parent(s).\n\nI was raised by a parent who didn't get it and a parent with undiagnosed ADHD themself. They didn't know, and they did their best, but I'm *still* angry with them both in different ways about how much easier they could have made my life, and how much work I could have *not* had to do to get rid of the mess they left.\n\nAnyone saying \"forgive her\" should understand that the kind of harm she was doing was on the level of slapping you every time you didn't finish work by bedtime because \"it's the only way they'll learn\".

And you said a very good point. Why didn't she help you instead of calling you lazy?\n\nMy son has ADHD, and yes, everything is hard. Playing (he gets too excited), reading, writing, counting... But it is our role as parents to help him. It is hard, depending on how tired he is, but he needs us. We both have demanding jobs and other children, so it's our role to find time for him.\n\nWhen I see how sensitive our kid is, how much he needs patient adults around him, and how distressed he can become if he fails sometimes, I can't imagine growing up hearing you're just lazy, and basically not good enough.\n\nI don't think your mother can realize that (some people just don't believe in neurodivergence).

And in fact, you actually describe many ADHD symptoms in her - the not letting you get a word in edgewise.  She also sounds childish and impulsive if she thinks it's was funny with your grades.  Again all can point to ADHD in her.\n\nBut quite frankly I would be cutting her off in some respects and not telling her any more of your medical journey.\n\nIt may be eye opening to have you medicated to help with that focus and who knows what you will do.  Consider going to back to school (medicated) and achieving what you never thought you could.  Then you can give your mother the big proverbial middle finger when you achieve your dreams.\n\nShe has not helped you at all and doesn't really deserve to be included in your successes.\n\nShe perhaps should consider a diagnosis herself.\n\nYou can't change the past but you sure can help control your future and guide it the way you want to.  You are young even if you don't think you are.  You've got the world at your feet and so much better that you found this out at 23 rather than 63.  Your mom may have missed her diagnosis but it doesn't mean you can't get yourself sorted.", "NTA. That's medical negligence. As someone who wasn't diagnosed autistic until I was 19 despite my mum trying from the age of 3 (AFAB people tend to get ignored when it comes to ASD/ADHD) my school life was hell and accommodations would have prevented burnout and poor qualifications. The fact that your issues were recognised and she decided she knew more than your doctor is medical negligence and that is NOT okay, nor is it your fault for struggling. Being ND is NOT being \"lazy\". There are a lot of support groups online if you want support. Many AFAB people have been through something similar, which I know doesn't make what you went through any less traumatic, but you will be able to find support. \u2764", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019ll be 52 this year.", "op=NTA\n\nyou have an absolute right to be pissed-she kept a medical condition from you and prevented you from being properly medicated.\n\nIf this was diabetes and she took you off insulin because she felt it wasn't helpful, people would call her abusive and criminally negligent.  But because it's ADHD, she gets to call you lazy?  and blame you?\n\nFeck her and everyone supporting her.  Get to a doctor, get a new/renewed diagnosis.  Get the help you need to moderate the symptoms of your condition.\n\nGood luck going forward with your new awareness(and NC/LC anyone who doesn't support you--as needed).", "I had a very similar issue.  My brother was 3 years older than me and had intense behavioral problems.   All of my parents time and energy went to him.   I got poor grades in subjects that didn't interest me.   When my parents would go to parent teacher stuff they would basically tell them without telling them that I had ADHD.  Long story short they never did anything to get me diagnosed so I just lived with it.   I got my diagnosis on my own at 34 and comparatively it's like living life on easy mode with meds. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nADHD is hard enough when you are on medication and gets accomodations, trying to get trough school without that and not even knowing WHY you're struggling sounds like a new type of hell", "I WOULD HAVE STABBED YOUR MOM IN THE FUCKING FACE", "NTA. As someone who was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, I wish I'd gotten a diagnosis when I was young. It would have meant I was able to get meds and help in place, and that I might not struggle as much as I do now. I'm so sorry you had to find out this way that things could have been different for you.", "NTA. This is one of the reasons, among others, why we don't speak to my husband's mother anymore. She never told him that he was diagnosed with ADHD and refused to medicate or treat him. She also claims that he \"turned out fine\" and absolves herself from any responsibility. Decades of struggle that he didn't have to experience. \n\nIt is medical neglect. You're right to feel angry with your mother.", "NTA\n\nYou deserved better from your Mom and the rest of the family. I would say apologize for calling her names, but Do Not apologize for confronting her. She deserved getting her but chewed out for her neglect.", "This is sickening that she did this to you. She didn't tell you because she wanted you to somehow power through and be neurotypical which has never once worked in all of human history. I'm so so sorry. NTA", "Yes and no..  She TA for blaming you for being lazy and so on.  YTA because your 23 & know there's a problem...  You could have gone to a doctor...  Your a adult now", "NTA. She decided mental health issues like ADHD weren\u2019t a real thing and gaslit you to think you were just lazy. You owe that woman hell.\n\nAs someone with ADHD, I can say with certainty that it\u2019s not ENTIRELY just her responsibility for your grades, but she definitely screwed you over. Meds are not a cure all, and it takes a lot of work to balance out ADHD problems.\n\nGood news is there are therapists who specialize in adult ADHD, as it\u2019s actually very common for parents/teachers/everyone to think we\u2019re making it up, as it\u2019s \u201csupposed to go away when you grow up\u201d. If you can\u2019t find an affordable therapist for it, I would recommend starting with group therapy for ADHD, as it\u2019s cheaper and so eye-opening and helpful. The sooner you can start the better.", "Oof. My parents are like this. NTA at all! Not only is OP coming to terms with ADHD, she's also learning about her medical neglect", "I feel like it\u2019s even worse, because she sees the damage, has an explanation for it, but instead of taking responsibility she makes fun of OP and blames her for it.", "Honestly it *did* My scores were too low to qualify for scholarships and I found out the college fund my grandparents were giving my mom and first stepdad checks for on Christmas + my birthday didn\u2019t exist, so I never got the chance to go to college. And I *really* wanted to go. \n\nSorry for late reply. I posted this late and conked out pretty soon after.", "A family member of one of my friends (a psychologist) actually told me they thought I might be autistic after knowing me for a bit and my friend asking them (friend is also autistic) \n\nNot a diagnosis obviously but I read they are also often comorbid. I kind of wonder if my mom gave up on my meds because my brother was also neuroatypical (is that the right term?) \n\nI also demonstrated the usual traits that are desirable in girls with it (quiet, self soothing. I was OBSESSED with reading and art. ) \n\nI excelled only in my English classes which just furthered my moms belief that I was lazy.", "Looking into Dyspraxia also made me realize I might have discalculia. Dyspraxia I\u2019m not sure about. It\u2019s possible but many anecdotes I\u2019ve been reading mention messy handwriting but that could be my own confirmation bias. I\u2019ll look into it more. Thank you.", "Thank you so much for the input. I\u2019m wondering if my family might have instinctively sided with my mom cuz I was the \u2018aggressive\u2019 one and I\u2019m physically stronger (but shorter) than her without thinking as deeply on it? That\u2019s my hope right now but I\u2019m also terrified of being wrong on that front.", "Part of me is relieved, especially with so much support. The other half is furious because I feel like the chance to be \u2018excellent\u2019 and feel proud of what I could learn was ripped from me because my mother didn\u2019t find what I was focusing on when medicated \u2018productive\u2019.", "I didn\u2019t know I had ADHD til this fight though. I experienced the side effects but. With my mom I just assumed she was correct that I was lazy/lacked discipline because I was easily distracted in most classes if I wasn\u2019t 100% focusing on focusing.", "She didn't know it until *this fight.* she has a right to be angry that her diagnosis was hidden from her and that she been emotionally and verbally abused instead of being helped.", "She deserves to be talked badly about. Denying treatment to one's child, for a diagnosed issue is abuse. Imagine a parent denying treatment to a diabetic or asthmatic child, and making them miss school because of their illness, you would not call this a disagreement between mother and daughter, right ?\n\n\nThat's what she's done to you. She set you down to fail, and then blamed and mocked you for it. This is terrible.", "Separately from the ADHD issue, you should check out r/raisedbynarcissists . I\u2019m no expert or anything, but what you\u2019ve said in your post and in this comment seems similar to things I\u2019ve read there.", "Another one not yet mentioned on this thread is (non-stimulant) Guanfacine, which I take daily to help with executive functioning, and supplement with a low dose of (stimulant) Adderall as needed.", "Have you tried to get records from your old school? They may have the name of your doctor that you were seeing during that period. My son has ASD, ADHD, and Trichotillomania. He was on Ritalin, but after High School he and his psychiatrist at the time decided to ween him off of it. He was also given ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) and it helped tremendously. He was on Vyvanse for about six months, but it made his Trichotillomania worse. As I said, try your old school from that time.", "I'm so fired up on your behalf right now. PLEASE talk to your doctor about this. You can function and have way better quality of life!! You can still go to college!! And it'll be better than it would have been as a teenager because you won't be fighting ADHD without knowing it! (Speaking from experience, that SUCKED.) From my perspective, you've had time stolen from you but now, you're set up to only go up from here. There's so much more to do and experience and I want that for you.", "You can still go. And if you get treated for ADHD, you will enjoy it more and perform better most likely.", "So were you lied to about your college fund, or did your mom just steal the money?", "No problem. You can have both ADHD and dyspraxia. Remember also that as you grow up your brain would have learn to compensate. You may also not have all the symptoms. I can certainly see this will my son (dyspraxia, ADHD (more ADD), sensory processing disorder, and dyslexia. His gross motor skills took longer to developed but they are not too bad, he still really struggles to write.... \n\n https://adhdinchildrensupport.com/adhd-and-dyspraxia-in-children/", "Honestly that's bullshit. Ngl it's probably a bit of the negative stigma attached to ADHD + social expectations of ladies being on top of things. Plus there are some people who think that women can't have ADHD as it presents a lot differently in us than it does men. How strong you are should not effect it. I think it's bias and ignorance not how strong you are.", "That's understandable. I also definitely felt relieved to finally have an explanation for my struggles that wasn't just that I was useless as a person. I also understand the last point - it's made me reflect on all the times in my life where I could have asked for better help and support had I known and understood my struggles. I'm sorry that your mum didn't think what you were focussing on was productive and so stopped giving you your meds, that's awful and I hate that you've struggled for so long.\n\nIt isn't easy, but you'll get there. I will say that the world isn't really designed for neurodivergent people, but there are plenty of people who want to help and to understand! If you ever want to talk about anything, you can message me if you think it might help.", "Honestly it feels a little wild to me. Posting to get a reality check and see if I was being a dick only to get upper cut with the revelation that this was medical neglect/abuse is. Something. Especially as people talk about it. I\u2019m realizing some other things in my life are\u2026 more than what I assumed.", "The more people explain it the more I\u2019m realizing they\u2019re right. And me opening up here anonymously has helped me reach out to my broader friend group (not as close to) and a few of them ere like \u201c\u2026 yeah your mom sucks I just didn\u2019t want to upset you\u2019\n\nWhich is mind boggling to me. The more I delve into my childhood and teen years the more I realize the abnormalities. I think part of me was hesitant to think anything about it cuz I almost lost my mom a few years ago (cancer).", "Really? I\u2019ll check it out. I mean. My mom is a bit\u2026 I guess old fashioned but I\u2019d never thought of her as a narcissist before.", "I googled executive functioning and ohhh my god. It\u2019s like finding out I had a diagnosis all over again. A weird mix of euphoria and hurt haha", "At this comment I wrote a short email asking my old school. I was in grade school so I understand chances are slim. \n\nMy brother was on Ritalin too! He got switched in HS I think but I know this now because I think there was a lawsuit and my mom talked about it a lot.", "WHAT", "I. I never really thought about it but the possibility she stole the money didn\u2019t occur to me. But the suggestion. Similarly to finding out about my diagnosis has. Illuminated something for me. My mom had a really bad online gambling addiction. (Like on facebook poker and slots, she used to play in casinos when I was really young.)\n\nThose two things together. Paint a very bad picture that\u2019s upsetting to me but also. Would finally explain what happened to it.", "Things could have been SO DIFFERENT for you if your mom had taken your diagnosis seriously. She cheated you out of the help you needed and then blamed you for not measuring up. What she did was terrible and abusive. I'm so sorry.", "I really can\u2019t say is she is or not. I wasn\u2019t raised in that kind of situation, but came across that sun once and occasionally read posts there. Your mom making fun of you for your struggles, discontinuing your medication because she didn\u2019t like the result but not pursuing a different option, and not taking you seriously about your lived experiences seems similar to the kinds of things people post there.", "Yup. So tons and *tons* of people with undiagnosed ADHD have suffered for years (or decades, in my mom's case) with treatment resistant depression. [Untreated ADHD](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.additudemag.com/adhd-and-depression-symptoms-treatment/amp/) can even *cause* depression. Plus having both can make the depression symptoms even worse.\n\nSo those are good reasons talking to your doctor about your mom having hidden your diagnosis is important- you are far from the first person to have a parent hide their diagnosis, unfortunately.", "She 100% stole your college fund.\n\nThe list of things I would like to call that miserable egg donor would get me banned.", "This is a good summary of how I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s putting so much into context for me. I want to cry both because I\u2019m happy I know now but so fucking sad that I missed out on that and FELT LIKE IT WAS MY OWN MORAL FAILING.", "A skim of the sub made me feel very seen. Which is also upsetting but validating. In for a penny in for a pound I guess.\n\nEdit: thank you for the sub recommendation by the way! It was illuminating despite my comments tone.", "I. What. Oh my god. Pardon my French but WHAT THE FUCK. I was borderline catatonic for almost two years with depression and it could have been BECAUSE of my adhd????\n\nI feel like I just got punched in the gut but I\u2019m also happy I know but. Fuck. Thank you though for the stats.", "I'm happy to help. I know just how hard both ADHD and depression are, and I'm so angry at the medical neglect and emotional/verbal abuse you've gone through because of your mom- which it sounds like she's still inflicting on you (I also know how hard it is to realize and admit- even just to yourself- that you have an abusive parent). I'd be so happy if anything I said helped even a tiny amount, even if it just means you feel validated.", "I hope you feel like you can start to take control of your life now that you know. I feel for you a lot. \n\nI had treatment resistant depression my entire childhood and young adulthood. It was ADHD and I'm so much better with treatment. There's light at the end of the tunnel."]}
