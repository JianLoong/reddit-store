Neither of them have been able to save more than two weeks' worth of pocket money at a time (and that was only because we forgot to give it to them one week lol). However, Kate has gotten it into her head that she can sell her old toys and get more money that way. FWIW, I'm a little proud of the entrepreneurial flair she is showing with that line of thinking lol.\n\nSo last night she was sifting through her old toys and found a pair of dress up shoes from her Elsa outfit that no longer fits her. She asked me if I thought she could sell it and I said maybe but reminded her that it was pretty old. She thought about it for a second and ran back with a sign on the shoes that said $10. I chuckled a bit told her that no one would ever buy it for $10. Kate got upset at me, I think, not because I laughed but because she was already counting those $10 and now she thinks she's not going to get it.\n\n(Don't even ask me about the logistics of selling her toys.

She sounds smart, teach her about the fact that things depreciate and the logistics rather than belittling her. YTA", "YTA. You can tell someone something WITHOUT making fun of them while you're doing it. It's, like, really easy.", "YTA. You could have said that so much more nicely. You chose to say it in a way that was hurtful to her, instead of being supportive as well as being realistic. It's not \"coddling\" to be kind.", "Bro, YTA. \nYou didn't give your kid any information on what she realistically could do to reach her goal/satisfy the expectations you're setting for her. Instead, you mock every idea she has and crush her spirit. A+ parenting, really.", "YTA. Look, no parent is perfect all of the time. But you could have let her learn this very useful lesson without your negative feedback. You could even have said, \"I'm not sure I would pay $10 for used shoes--do you think you are pricing it correctly?\" And you KNOW laughing is not the move here. Again, I'm not judging. I've been that parent, too.\n\nAlso, you don't know that nobody will buy it. Maybe she's a born saleswoman. I mean, I'm guessing the correct price is actually $0 for used Elsa shoes, but we don't know.", "YTA. Why do you have to be such a killjoy? What's the harm in letting her try?\n\nI was about your daughter's age when I decided I wanted to sell my bike for $10. (This was ~50 years ago so the bike probably didn't cost $20 new, and it was kind of beat up.) Dad explained that to me and mentioned that we only had about 10 cars/day drive down our road, but got a laugh out of it and said: \"Go ahead\". So I put it in the front yard with a For Sale sign on it and guess what? Not five minutes later a guy stopped by to buy it.\n\nBe a more supportive parent, OP, and let your kids learn by *doing*.", "YTA. From your \"we forgot to give it to them lol\" (way to be an example of consistent money management), to the disingenuous \"I chuckled a bit,\" and right through to the trifecta of: \"I will indulge,\" \"coddling in general is not for me,\" and \"I maintain--\"\n\nYour post REEKS of superiority complex, which is incredibly pathetic considering you're talking to an EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILD. Good lord, get a grip.", "YTA omg.\n\nShe's 8! And her brother even YOUNGER!! And you want to already try teach CHILDREN, heck one of them might even be a TODDLER, for all we know, how to handle money like an ADULT??? \n\nEver heard of a piggy bank?!?! Ya know how we as adults have bigger and more complicated piggy banks than an actual physical piggy bank you can buy some even less than $5???? \n\nLike I can see what you are trying to teach but the way you're doing it is not it. It's. Not. It.\nLet them be kids for God's sake man. Give each a piggy bank, doesn't need to be a fancy glass one just an plastic one or rubber even is enough, and tell them they can put how ever much of their allowance in their piggy bank and what they still have left over they can buy the snacks or whatever they want with the amount left over. \n\nThis way they'll be able to save up for the big toys they want while still being able to buy other things along with learning to properly save up money. Because sir I highly doubt any adult if they're saving up for something that the saved up money is in their wallets. Any one would have it in one of those piggy banks you have to break open or opened up a savings account at the actual adult piggy bank called 'The Bank'. \n\nI don't even want to start at you discouraging your daughter about selling her shoes because of the price she felt was adequate enough instead of oh I don't know, actually being a helpful parent and go look up with her how much her used-shoes actually would be on the market. This way she'll even learn how to put prices on her old clothes and toys she wants to sell to get it to be sold as she has a growing interest on figuring ways to get more money. AND IT WOULD BE A BONDING EXPERIENCE TOO!!!\n\nYou just threw that away! Again I can see what direction you want to push your children, but you are doing it the wrong way. Understand, learn and keep the suggestions we give you and become a better parent that'll have children who won't despise you because believe me. When they grow up with the way you are teaching them right now, they'll feel like any thing with you is a transaction and if they don't have or didn't save up the set goal of money in time they would've failed you.", "I understand where you are coming from but these may be unrealistic expectations for an 8 year old. Did you explain why she won\u2019t get $10 for the Elsa shoes? Did you help her understand that while she may want $10 for them that she could be waiting a long time before finding someone willing to pay that amount? Did you help her understand the dynamics of negotiation? \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA, but keep in mind you are guiding an 8 year old. There is a difference in coddling and guiding your children based on their age and ability to comprehend certain topics.", "Of COURSE you are an asshole. She's EIGHT. Yta", "The part about 8 year needing realistic expectations is just bizarre to me, their just a child?!", "YTA. There was no reason to laugh. She\u2019s 8. That was cruel. It\u2019s great you want to teach them about this stuff but you need to remember that children\u2019s brains are VERY different to adult brains. They are literally incapable of comprehending certain things until they reach certain milestones. The way you reacted was cruel and definitely made her feel awful. She will remember this. Apologise to her.", "YTA. She is too young to have greed instilled as a value, and you are, in fact, crushing her spirit. My mom used to be \"realistic\" and tell me I would never get what I wanted and I barely talk to her now and live 2,000 miles away.", "YTA\n\nLet her figure it out when no one buys them. If she is upset, tell her consider lowering the prices.", "Look, two preteens knocked on our door and asked us if we wanted to buy a deck of cards or some other random object because they are trying to raise money for something they want. My husband said no thank you and they went in their way. Sure, he could have laughed at them. But isn\u2019t it better that they TRY something and learn the end result for themselves? The same applies to your daughter. You\u2019d have better luck teaching her appropriate pricing by taking her to yard sales so she can see the prices of comparable items, that way she can decide what to sell hers for. \n\nYTA", "YTA why not say you would post it online and see what people think because you yourself don't know how much they are worth now instead of lol u won't get THAT much to an 8 year old", "Wow man.... Wow.\nYour daughter is 8 years old. How tf do you expect her to know about the logistics, or about how much she should charge? I agree its good for kids to know the price of money  it is your job to teach her, not to laugh at her when she does something wrong.  \nBelieve me, she was sad for you laughing at her not because she was expecting the money already.\n\nShe is 8 and her brother is younger... Cut them some slack, or you will manage all on your own to crush her entrepreneurial spirit.

Not 18. YTA.", "8 and she can't work out the stock market yet?

Thanks!!", "YTA. Those foster kids prob need to be coddled a bit.", "YTA \n\nI\u2019ll buy her shoes for $10. \n\nSo you either have to apologise for being wrong- or you\u2019re a liar.", "You could have let her \"test the market\" and then explained. Somebody might be looking for just those shoes and maybe she'd be lucky", "YTA let your kids be kids.", "Not going to put a judgement on but why not google how much they are new and if there are others on selling sites and how much they are going for. Find a solution before you create a problem.", "YTA.  You laughed at her when you recognize yourself she doesn\u2019t understand the value of money. How is laughing at her going to help her see the value in money? \n\nHere\u2019s what you could do. You could say \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much you could make from those. Let\u2019s look at eBay and Facebook marketplace and see what people are selling similar items for! Maybe $10 is too much, but maybe $2, let\u2019s see! Sometimes other people value things differently, and if you don\u2019t want to sell them for just $2, then you know they mean more to you than the money.\u201d  \n\nYou could also say something like \u201cthose might not sell for much money but how about we come up with a good group of toys that we can donate to a good cause, and you and I can decide what that is worth. I\u2019ll give you half the money and we can create an account to save the other half for a big toy. Then you know you have a place you can put money to save because I know it\u2019s tempting to spend it right away!\u201d", "Yta. Reminds me of when my dad laughed at me when I was learning to drive.. we aren\u2019t close.", "so you are blaming your kids failure at saving money at 8 year old on them, despite you being the reason they failed. you could teach them in much better ways. \n\ne.g. letting them spend half  of their money and saving the other half so that they can still get toys and could possible understand why they are saving- which currently I doubt you have explained to them.\n\nshe isn't going to know the ins and out of selling shit when she is 8, and certainly wont realise that 10 may be too high, its your job as a parent to teach her and guide her, not laugh at her. \n\nYTA", "YTA ,you may have wanted to say your opinion but not in a harsh way a kid won't be happy to hear", "You could always introduce her to FB Marketplace. If she pitched a good story about why she needed the money (and her age) she would likely have somebody willing to pay her $10 for ratty old shoes. LOL", "NTA.

Probably, their parents also teach them how things work.", "NTA, but why not help your daughter try to sell the shoes on eBay?\n\nEven if they don't sell, she'll have learned something about buy-and-sell.", "NTA\n\nIf she was already hoping for $10, thatd just get her hopes up and would be sad when it doesnt happen. Better to be up front and honest about it.", "NTA, you were simply trying to share some life experience that she was too young to understand.

She would be more disappointed by not selling the shoes instead of the truth about why the shoes did not sell", "NAH. Kids can't learn too young that things cost money and money has to be earned.\n\nI saw the post suggesting a garage sale, and your concerns. Maybe you could have your kids gather all their older toys and outgrown clothes, donate them to a shelter or children's home, then finance a store credit for a specified amount (say fifty cents per donated item) towards something they want. The items would go to a good cause, maybe they will learn something about children who have less than they do, and since they're still kids, get a small tangible reward.", "INFO: are the kids doing chores in exchange for the pocket money?

Teach her to donate the toys or do a family garage sale. You do not want an 8 year demanding you to sell her stuff and make money throughout the year. Being obsessed with entrepreneurship is not that great. It\u2019s a bad road to go down. She needs to be learning simple pleasures, not how to have a side hustle. Stick with allowance for now.

But they made me earn money for certain toys that I wanted, because they didn't want to spoil me all the time.\n\nMy dad was a huge collector of vintage signs, cars, and new/old toys--especially hotwheels and hit toys like beanie babies, furbies, star wars stuff...you know, the stuff that people believed would 'make them millions one day' lol. (And some toys DID make him a lot of money)\n\nI'm saying that because he KNEW the value of those toys, and when I showed interest in anything, he'd usually get a spare just in case. He had a thing with 'taking toys that I lost interest in' (I hadn't lol, moving like 15 years down the line I found a LOT of toys I thought I'd just lost :| ) but after a while he thought I'd learn a good monetary lesson if we worked things out together.\n\nI took good care of my toys, so when I had a toy that I didn't want anymore, I'd either 'sell' it to my dad, or we'd have a small yard sale with some of my toys/books/clothes/etc.\n\nWhen 'selling' to my dad, I'd offer a price, and he'd tell me he bought it for suchandsuch, so I needed to think of a better price cause now it was open and played with. Was I upset to sometimes sell the toy I got for 15-20$ for like--10$? Yes, but this actually helped me down the line to open my own business for a while, and knew how to beat the market with prices while still making a rather large profit.\n\nNow, with the knowledge of supply and demand, plus knowing how to undercut others, and how to price opened items properly, I usually have no issues selling anything I end up wanting to sell.\n\nHowever, my dad never chuckled at me and told me off...he always explained *why*, and if I got pouty or grumpy, he'd tell me to come back the next day once I thought about it.\n\nI'm glad that I saw OP went to talk to his daughter and told her WHY 10$ wouldn't work, and that the outfit hadn't even been 10$ to begin with. There definitely is sentimental value with feelings AND money in there, but I don't think 8 is 'too young' to begin to understand how buying/selling/trading works.\n\nMaybe I'm just odd cause I also grew up trading pokemon and magic cards, too. So much research haha.\n\nAnyway, wall of text.", "INFO: Did you pay them for the one week you missed in addition to the upcoming week or no?", "YTA. You could have taught her how to price things by explaining how much the shoes cost originally, how long it\u2019s been since you brought them, and how value can depreciate with time and use.

There were so many lessons here and you missed them all AND hurt her feelings", "YTA. \n\nA child's brain doesn't even work the same as yours.", "NTA but you need to explain to them about base cost, and how things lose value over time especially considering what kind of quality said item is in", "Yike.

Have you any concept how not only incorrect but dangerous it is to teach this little girl that she needs to sell her possessions? A kid who likely has already had to give up the majority of her possessions and may have to again for no compensation? Who has very limited control of her possessions and her security? Who almost certainly has trauma? If this is accurate and real please you desperately need further training. This isn't just asshole behavior it could actually lead to very real harm.", "YTA. First of all you could try selling them and you could have said well we'll give it a try and see if someone does buy them for 10 but it's possible we may have to take less because the shoes are a little old. That would have been a very good explanation not just laughing at her and telling her no one's going to pay that much. And as for selling it she's probably heard of eBay, so I guess she thinks you can put the shoes on eBay for her. It's not like she can do it. I get trying to teach them but to me it's still a little young to try and teach about money but I guess you're never too young to start. \n\nHeck I just put some shoes on eBay, my kid thought they'd get full retail that I was like it's not going to happen they're $200 shoes. We put them up for $140 and they sold after a month. But would have returned them but they were an unexpected gift and the company they came from wouldn't accept the return (wrong size) because they were gift, online order so we didn't have anything in terms of order number or packing slip nothing.

She\u2019s EIGHT and you\u2019re saying she still hasn\u2019t been able to save money for more than 2 weeks as if it\u2019s a let down. Maybe it\u2019s not how you see it, but tone and speech matter. This post gives off the vibes of a parent who will never be satisfied. Maybe that\u2019s not your intentions. But it\u2019s what people get. And likely how your child will perceive it.", "Hey just think only 10 more years until she cuts contact with you. Fuck, you sound like a prick to be around.", "No thanks sweetie. ;-) ;-)\nI'm not really interested in arguing with a condescending creep.", "Maybe they move on, on the surface but those memories will be there. My father was a bit like you\n Even at the age of 36 I still remember the times he laughed like that and I made a promise to myself never to be like that with my kids and to be honest but kind and actually guide them instead of laughing as if they're already supposed to know these things. My point is, you and she both may think she has moved on but if this is a frequent pattern of behavior on your part, she *will* remember.", "If you've been trying to explain it but she doesn't understand, then that's your fault, not her fault.\n\nYou're setting it up like this is a story about your daughter messing up, but it's really a story of you being a shitty teacher.", "Maybe go online or to a store and show her what the going rate is for new Elsa shoes. Or take a look on a reselling website and see what others are asking. Showing her would probably help.", "You've only had this young daughter for what, six months? These foster kids need love, patience, and guidance. They do not need to be laughed at for not fully understanding how much a used pair of Elsa shoes cost.", "I dont think you're the AH, being nice to your kid and totally having to talk like a fairy princess all the time are different things. If she was 6 maybe but at 8 she needs to start hearing some honesty too.  \n\n\nCan I offer some advice for making her understand the value thing though? Rather than trying to explains sentimental value vs actual value just focus on \"if somebody looked in a shop they could get this item NEW for $1, because of that they will not pay more for a used item because other people want to save money just like you do so part of that is trying to spend less for the things they buy\". or some crap like that haha", "I thinks its better she handles rejection from outsiders than from the people who should be her safe space. I think its more harmful.", "She\u2019ll be okay. Just don\u2019t coddle her too much. It\u2019s kids that are overly coddled that have reactions like that.", "This comment should be higher. YTA, OP. Try developing some tact and teach her that by modeling kind behavior.", "Yea, true he could have been more gentle with it, I think this comes down to different parenting styles though and NAH. I find it a little too dramatic to say \"her hopes were crushed\" or anything like that.", "You're cute (-:", "My dad was like, highlighting my mistakes and the cruelly laughing and telling our extended family how stupid I was.  \n\nI left as soon as I could.   But I had to go back for medical reasons and decided to try and run a small business from home and was working out projections etc on excel when he peered over my shoulder and told me in the most patronising tone, that I'd made  mistake.  He threw his head back laughing.  I was back to being a child filled with shame.  That damaged our relationship further, with him sneering at me saying you have a degree but you are stupid \ud83d\ude12. \n\nYou want to be right all the time do you?  Because that feeling never goes away and she will remember.  \n\nDoes it make you feel better hurting your child like that?\n\nYTA and a big one.  Do better and be better", "There is no parenting style where laughing at your kid for not knowing how much shoes cost is a good move. \n\nHow the hell would she know what shoes cost? She's eight!\n\nMaking fun of someone for not knowing something they couldn't possibly know isn't parenting. It's just being a dick.", "Wow...  I hope youre not such a condescending prick with your kids, even if it sounds like you are. I feel bad for them", "And you are an asshole, so take a bow.", "Jesus Christ, and an full on ass like you is taking in foster children? How did that happen, aren\u2019t they supposed to have standards for the children?", "Your poor kids....", "Gross.", "I really feel sorry for those kids now, given this exchange. Not a good look, OP.", "Can't imagine how you managed to upset your daughter /s", "You asked if you were an asshole, you were told you are. Now you\u2019re getting pissy. Thanks for confirming the verdict."]}
