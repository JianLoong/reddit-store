Then, encourage them to brush it off by doing something positive with you they enjoy doing. Always remember you need to be the parent they can come to for emotional support since clearly he is not capable of such.

Get the court to appoint a lawyer for the kids.  Write down and make note of every weird thing the kids come back and say/do.

You know what your husband is doing is wrong, and your lawyer knows what to do about it. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard, but try to take the emotion out of it and don\u2019t let your ex get to you (as he is trying to do!)", "NTA NTA NTA!!!!\n\nGirl he\u2019s attempting to alienate your children from you by telling them lies and making you out to be the bad guy. He\u2019s a narcissist and frankly he sounds emotionally abusive. He\u2019s only going to get worse I hope you know this. You need to cut this behavior at its heels and have the court do something about it. The time for pleasantries and peace went out the window the second he tried to weaponize the kids. He\u2019s jealous, bitter, and his ego\u2019s bruised. Those are traits that just disappear. You think it\u2019s bad now? Wait till you start dating (even a decade from now) and he starts telling them mommy\u2019s a W, and cheated on him because he\u2019s bitter you\u2019re moving on. He wants to punish you for leaving him; and he wants to coerce you into staying. It\u2019s why he\u2019s contesting the divorce , and it\u2019s why he\u2019s using the kids. You also need to start documenting EVERYTHING. Record your kids (without them noticing if it\u2019s easier, face the camera down like you\u2019re scrolling and record the convo).\n\nDo that anytime they say anything strange or that sounds like it came from him. If it\u2019s legal in your state record any phone calls between you on your phone. There are apps you can download for this, screenshot all texts. Even the seemingly innocent ones in case later he tries to delete certain texts to leave our context to either lie to other people, the kids, or the court. You also need to be emailing yourself all of this in case anything happens to your phone you can be positive you won\u2019t lose it, the cloud isn\u2019t enough. It also helps that emailing yourself all of this leaves a time stamp/date of when it occurred. I know this seems like alot but he\u2019s shown he\u2019s fully willing to play dirty to try to get you back or to make you pay for refusing to stay, you have to be on your P\u2019s + Q\u2019s. For your sake, but mainly for the sake and health or your future relationship with your children.\n\n I had a bitter divorced parent that spent years alienating me from the other and telling lies. The parent they lied about was always amazing to me, did everything for me, supported me, truly a good person and good parent. The lies got to my head though, it fucked my head up bad. I started questioning my sanity, and even though I couldn\u2019t believe it I started to see said parent in a different light. I treated them bad, I\u2019d refuse contact at times, it ruined our relationship for a decade and even now though things are much better there\u2019s still remnants of issues from that time. Our relationship still isn\u2019t the same, I still question if my lived experience is wrong, I can\u2019t trust people for shit, it\u2019s not a future or experience you want your kids to live I can promise that. So advocate to save them from it, do everything you can. Fight like hell to get that guardian ad Leitrim, they check in pretty often with the kids, they know what signs to look for in terms of alienation. \n\nThey can also help advocate for things like therapy for them if you ex is against it and you have equal medical rights. They will be a huge advocate for you and for your kids, and If it gets dismissed keep fighting and again keep documenting every single little thing. No matter how tame or insignificant it may seem. Also don\u2019t let yourself be convinced that you\u2019re the bad guy for advocating for yourself, and for advocating for your children. Not doing what he wants is not a crime. You are not a bad person for doing something he doesn\u2019t like. Remember his opinion of you is biased so don\u2019t believe a word he says about you. He has everything to gain by convincing you that you\u2019re in the wrong for prioritizing and protecting yourself and your kids. You are doing the right thing, please don\u2019t let yourself be convinced otherwise. Sidenote: it would also be wise to request only having contact through a court mediated app. Basically it\u2019s a chat like messenger but the court can read every message, they also block foul language and abusive/mean comments. It\u2019s a great tool for xo parenting with someone like your ex. It forces him to be civil and allows you to block him and refuse any other kind of contact that\u2019s not child related and pertinent to your co parenting relationship. See if you can do that then block him and/or change your number.", "I was the kid in this situation. Third party lawyer was great although I had 4 different therapists because each side kept getting the reports thrown out of court usually using loopholes but it was because one of the sides didn't like what the therapists had said (I have seen a couple of those reports years later and the ones dad got thrown out were definitely wrong in some of the facts they claimed about me).\n\nAll I'm saying is please do your research and get a therapists approved by the court if possible because having multiple therapists as a kid had meant i dont really trust therapists for myself. I wasn't stupid I realised that the different therapists kept asking the same questions and I started putting it together on my own (dad only confirmed when I was 18 and had been living with him 4 years).
