Please stick to your guns and hire that 3rd party to protect the best interests of your children. Of course his lawyer doesn't want that, because he's fully aware of what his client is doing and knows a 3rd party will do nothing but harm their interests. I'd also insist the kids get individual therapy sessions with a shrink who specializes in divorce proceedings, because they'll be able to recognize the early signs of manipulation, psychological abuse and parental alienation. I don't know about the validity of voice recordings wherever you are, but it might be a good idea to record those conversations with your kids (where they talk about mommy coming home, Jesus, etc) so the courts have a way to verify everything you say. Congratulations on realizing the marriage was not good for you and doing everything in your power to leave it. Sounds like you're getting rid of a walking, talking red flag. Stay strong, keep protecting your kids and listen to your lawyer's advice - he/she knows the case and will provide the best orientation possible.", "Absolutely sensible to have a 3rd party representing the interests of the children. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It is absolutely right to seek a neutral third party for the children, especially since this is clear manipulation. \u201cJesus doesn\u2019t want Mommy and Daddy to have two houses,\u201d ugh, gross.\n\nAlso talk yo your lawyer about a court-appointed psychologist to speak to and evaluate the children. I saw one, with my mom, with my dad, and on my own when I was a child (7yo) and my parents were divorcing: she was sharp and knew exactly what was up with my parents and me very quickly. Young children have little filter and don\u2019t lie well and a psychologist will be able to tell the court if there is any attempt at alienation or manipulation going on (as there obviously is, but a court-appointed psychologist is neutral and their findings go on the record).\n\nSo glad you\u2019re leaving this man. It takes an unfathomable degree of evil to try to get your small children to guilt your spouse into taking you back. I can only imagine what living with him was like.", "NTA.  You\u2019re looking out for your kids.  That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.", "He very much is manipulating and the danger is that he will try to alienate them. I would definitely consult your attorney about what would be best--if they have their own attorney or what, or ask the court to get involved in evaluating the situation. I would be consistent in my messaging with them and say that what they are saying (hearing) is a mistake, that they have two homes now, that you're getting divorced, and if he brings Jesus in again, tell them Jesus wants you to be happy. Document EVERYTHING they say and when and keep track of all of it. Record them if your attorney thinks that's a good idea. Don't overemphasize it with them. Just keep up your messaging and make sure they see that as the normal in your life.  NTA", "NTA - these are disturbing comments and need to be addressed.
