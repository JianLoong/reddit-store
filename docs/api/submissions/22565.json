They're on the wrong side of history and influencing your children to think like them. \n\nBUT, yelling and threatening to call the cops on them was a bit much.

I would definitely take a pause on seeing your parents or having them around their kids, and I think you need to get into some kind of therapy since you sound a little unhinged.\n\nINFO: How come you adopted the 10 yr old kid when you already had one with Cerebral Palsy? I actually think the grandparental issue (them trying to help, saying things you don't agree with) is kind of sympomatic of the larger issue, which is that you've got multiple kids with struggles of various kinds. It sounds like the whole structure of the family/care/support needs to be re-thought, and clearly your parents are not the solution.

What are you saying? Why are you saying this? Did you tell them the choices your wife makes with you is between the two of you and your parents don\u2019t get a say? Maybe give an ultimatum? What they did was 110% wrong but I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re actually downplaying what happened. Seems like a huge leap. \u2026and now I see (after reading your comments) why your wife is mad. No. Threatening to call the cops makes you just as wrong. This was a teachable moment and instead of using it to your benefit you threatened to have them arrested for disagreeing with your life choices. That was dramatic and over the top.", "Everything was fine  and you are correct til you said you\u2019d call the police, don\u2019t say stupid things like that.", "Parents shouldn't have started preaching to your kids, but you went massively overboard when you threatened to call the cops.\n\nESH. You all need to sit down and discuss boundaries like sensible adults, if only for the sake of the 16 year old who's going to have to take up more caring responsibility now grandma and granddad aren't around.
