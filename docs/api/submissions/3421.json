My mom, without my knowledge until recently, decided to pay his car off and help him open a credit card through our bank, getting rid of at least one of those excuses. He has yet to pay her back, and it happened early this year. \n\nFast forward a few months, his transmission officially starts acting up, to which he says \"I don't feel safe driving it\" and would only take it on the 10 min drive to work and back, leaving us to take my car everywhere else. I don't mind, I bought a newer car last year and I figured it would be fine while he decided what to do about his. \n\nWell, I recently got a job working from home, which means I won't really need to drive my car around.

You\u2019ll be dumb if you continue to stay with him in the first place", "Nta tell him he can't use your car anymore and maybe reevaluate what he's bringing into the relationship other than debt and car depreciation", "NTA. Dump the loser. He needs to grow up.", "NTA!! You and you mother have went above and beyond for him, he's acting like a real AH here and honestly I would seriously think about your future with him...he can't even pay for half a car payment because it's dipping into his savings...where's the rest of his money going?! It's not going to pay for his car getting fixed, paying your mom back or paying bills!! TF??", "NTA and take the keys. Tell him its not his car but your car so he cant use it.", "NTA. Your family has helped him unwarranted and now he won\u2019t contribute to help you when he\u2019s the one using out your mileage? He now feels entitled to your stuff while letting you handle the expense. If this is a common pattern, drop the scrub. If not, you need to have a serious conversation", "Either it\u2019s your car and it stays home with you or it\u2019s our car and he helps with payment.

He agreed, it doesn\u2019t matter if it wasn\u2019t brought up at the very beginning. You had a discussion about it, and he said okay. Next time, always better to have things in writing. I would also take back the keys until he pays his half.", "Is he on your car insurance? If so, take him off of it and refuse to let him drive your car because if he does and he gets caught, he will be in a bigger predicament for driving a vehicle he\u2019s not authorized to drive.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough your mom got him out of the hole once and helped him get a credit card without informing you, but that\u2019s water under the bridge now. He should have done the things necessary to keep his car up. That\u2019s his fault. He lives with you and is using the car and isn\u2019t using his own, he should pay half the bill too.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a joint account together at this point, don\u2019t bother getting one, and I wouldn\u2019t ever get married to this guy until he improves this behavior. He is selfish and thinks everyone owes him something and that he owes no one anything, and that\u2019s not how this world works.\n\nI don\u2019t know how great your relationship is otherwise, but if he\u2019s always this selfish, I would start looking for a way out because if you have no reason to believe that this will get better, and I\u2019m not saying this will happen because I do not know- but it *can* actually get worse.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  You were fine to ask and he agreed.  He needs to figure out his finances", "NTA- Look, in the long run its not going to work out..h\nYour mom used money on him, and he is using you for a car and doesn't even want to pay you back.

He owes your mom money, he is using your car and not compensating you for that use (wear and tear, higher milage).  This guy has found a couple of women who will let him take advantage of them so he doesn't have to get his own act together.  He's got a very cushy little situation here and isn't going to change.  Why should he?  He gets to be an irresponsible teenager and somebody else will resolve his problems for him.", "NTA if he explicitly agreed to your terms to pay, and suddenly is backing out now that payments are due, seems like there\u2019s some other issues going on here.

Excuse after excuse with no change, huh? The longer this goes on the harder it will be for you to get him to cooperate with sharing financial duties. Tell him he can\u2019t drive your car then and if he wants to he can foot the insurance, gas and car payments since he\u2019s the one driving it. His reaction will be pretty telling. He\u2019s worried about his savings but didn\u2019t use them to fix his own shit for a year? Won\u2019t repay the loan to your mom? Reneged on a deal with you? He\u2019s an AH and TH here.", "NTA.

He likes receiving and not giving. He is more than happy to be helped by your mom, but when you ask in advance to help financially with the car, he then reneged? Selfish!   \n\nI suggest taking a spark plug or 2 out of your car and say that the car doesn't work anymore so he can't use it. If he wants to help financially to get it fixed, then great! Go to a mom and pop garage, tell them the real story, get them to print you an invoice for how ever much he owes you x2, then show the invoice to him and say that if he pays half then you can afford to fix the car. Get the money, pocket it, then replace the spark plug and sleep well that night. Then punt his cheap butt to the curb the next day because his stingy selfish financial behaviour will only snowball in the future.", "NTA. Leave this guy and let your mom take him to court to recover her money.", "NTA You guys have done too much for him already. Where is all his money going that he can't afford a necessity like fixing his car?  I've never heard a man say they felt unsafe driving their car \ud83d\ude06 If he no longer agrees to helping with the payment, then he doesn't get to drive your new car. I actually recommend not letting him drive it even if he wanted to make payments now. So many things can happen and I think you will be stuck paying for any damages. Your mom helped him free up some money, so let him fix his car and use his credit card. He needs to work on his finances and credit to have any future. Don't be stuck being the only one in the relationship with good credit, he'll depend on you for everything and hold you back.", "While he sounds like quite the catch, maybe you can really consider if this is an argument you want to keep having. He\u2019s been putting car issues on hold for 4 years while happily mooching off your mom etc. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want to pay for the car, remove the car from him at the very least. NTA", "NTA you should tell him he should be nicer to his sugar mamma", "your NTA, no matter what the answer to this question is but does he work a job that pays so little he can't afford a car.  Or he just doesn't want to pay?\n\nThe answer to that might help you decide how to proceed from here though.", "NTA. He won't help with car payment he doesn't use the car. For example, my friend has been letting us use his car until we get our debt figured out and find our own place (we moved home from out of state and he offered to help us out until we got on our feet due to an abusive situation). We made an agreement with him to help with half of the car costs in exchange for us using the car. My husband works, and Im on bed rest for the last three weeks of my pregnancy, so being able to get to those appointments is crucial. However, I think this is just common courtesy.", "NTA I don't let people drive my car because I don't want the headache. If he doesn't want to contribute to the maintenance and upkeep of your car, tell him to call a taxi or rideshare and get your keys back.  He'll have to dig his into his savings but it's incentive for him to stop freeloading off you and your mother's generosity.", "NTA, but don't have him make payments on it or he will claim ownership. He can cover the insurance and taxes though.", "NTA.  I\u2019d be doesn\u2019t want to pay you anything, take the car keys back and remove him from your insurance.  Problem solved. \n\nBtw, I\u2019d dump the guy.  He sounds like a user", "No need to post this. This is the most obvious case yet. He\u2019s clearly the AH. How are u using someone\u2019s car almost everyday but refuse to help with their payments.", "NTA. He agreed to pay half, and when the time comes to pay,  suddenly you're the bad guy?!? After letting him take your car every day, and leaving you without transportation!?! \n\nThe guy is taking advantage of you. Don't let him use your car anymore, and don't take him anywhere in your car until he's got a safe, reliable car that can be used to transport both of you. You shouldn't be racking up miles on your car for anything to do with him. \n\nBetter yet - kick him out.", "Take the car back then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nNTA", "NTA, obviously don't let him drive it anymore and tell your family not to give him money", "NTA, if he's driving this car Mon-Fri, then he owes you money for the wear and tear at least.", "NTA but the boyfriend is.  There's a reason he had crappy credit.  Unless this is how you want to live forever, it's time to cut ties.", "NTA. Why do mooches always end up with good people who have good parents that they also mooch off of?", "ESH.\n\n1) It doesn\u2019t sound like your mom loaned him the money, just that she paid it off. That\u2019s a gift, so he doesn\u2019t have to pay that back.\n\n2) He doesn\u2019t sound very responsible, and you should reconsider tying yourself to this person long term. \n\n3) Your mom way overstepped here to begin with. She\u2019s getting too involved in the relationship.\n\n4) He should not be helping you pay your car, because he gets no equity in it. He should be filling your tank, though. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think the two of you are compatible.", "I don't think you're wrong for asking but I do think you're wrong for changing terms of how you let him use the car after he already started using it. I also think he's seeing for having a problem with paying half the car payment. ESH.", "ESH. Your boyfriend absolutely should pay, but he has a history of using you. You are responsible for choosing the people in your life, and you have chosen (and continue to choose) to be used.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
