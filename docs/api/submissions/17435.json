I\u2019ve asked her multiple times on multiple occasions to please move and go to the park across the road, as not only is it just weird, but i have a dog that is sensitive to noises and will constantly bark when her loud child is here. Id had enough when today, they were back again after being told multiple times to not do this. My mum (F45) had just finished a night shift and was sleeping in the room right next to the front yard, this paired with the situation, just pissed me off more, so i told the lady through the camera speaker, that she has been told multiple times not to do this, her child is messing with out property and there is a perfectly fine park across the road, and to kindly fuck off.
