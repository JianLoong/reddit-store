I understand that i killed the party but also i think i acted right. \n\nI was being forced into something that i really didn't need or care to invest any energy into.\n\nI love dogs and everything but you can't just bring one in my life without any prior discussion. \n\nI do feel like a dick but hey what would you have done?", "created_utc": 1686425073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1468q33/aita_for_refusing_the_puppy_birthday_gift_from_my/", "score": 85, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I talked about getting another cat even more. My birthday comes around\u2014and it\u2019s a kitten birthday gift! LOVE! But\u2026that\u2019s not what happened here. If you two had discussed dogs in the past and it was clear you could both take care of it and you\u2019d expressed wanting one\u2014I STILL wouldn\u2019t gift a puppy!!! Breed is important and she made a huge decision without you. What if you wanted a dog, envisioning a medium sized chill dog and she comes home with a husky puppy? Not okay. Cats are one thing\u2014dogs are a whole other situation. NTA for saying no, but you should have kept it at that and discussed it later, without other people around.", "ESH. No one should ever give someone an animal without his/her permission.

Even if she'd bought the dog basically for herself (as it  sounds like she may have done), you would think she would have tried to have some sort of conversation about it beforehand.  That you've never even discussed it makes her 'gift' very weird, and I understand your reaction.", "ESH.  You're right that a pet requires a prior discussion but you were pretty assholey at the get-together.  And you know you were assholey or you wouldn't have bothered with the excuses of \"I was a little bit drunk too and I couldn't process everything that was going on\".  Okay, you were drunk.  But drunk you was a bit of an asshole.  This is your girlfriend of six years and you choose to bust apple bags \"in front of everyone\"?  Asshole.", "Light ESH. A dog is a horrible gift unless someone has made it VERY clear they *want* a dog. You shouldn\u2019t have said the things you did in front of other people, but you were drunk and someone was trying to force a 15+ year responsibility on you, can\u2019t expect a perfect reaction.", "ESH never get a pet without discussing it but you didn\u2019t need to start listing all of her flaws in public", "ESH. Pets are a ridiculous and inappropriate gift. Even if someone has expressed interest, most people want to pick out their own pet for a variety of reasons (breed, size, temperament etc). \n\nThat being said insulting her at the birthday dinner in front of everyone was also uncalled for. You could\u2019ve just as easily said  what you said here \u201cI love dogs but don\u2019t want to invest the energy into caring for one.\u201d You could\u2019ve also taken her aside.
