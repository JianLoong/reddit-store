She had precisely zero legs to stand on with gifting you a puppy without *SERIOUS* prior discussion. That is a life, a responsibility, and, as blunt as it is to say, a long term financial burden that requires preparation, forethought, and personal desire to take on. Dogs require THOUSANDS of dollars worth of bills in the first year alone - shots, grooming(every 6 weeks minimum for life, more depending on breed), training(first year of life, at least), spay/neuter(in my area, over $500 - more expensive depending on weight and breed), etc. Are you anywhere near a good vet that is accepting clients? What about a decent groomer and trainer that doesn't cost $300+ per session? There's your home to consider - is it a pet friendly/safe building/house/neighbourhood? Do you have allergies that she does or doesn't know about? Do you have any desire to need to clean dog hair/fur off of LITERALLY EVERYTHING for the next 12-18 years? Are you able to afford it at all? Are you someone who values freedom and spontaneity or is a steady, constant schedule more you? It's lots of personal requirements and restriction of freedoms for at *least* the first year, if not longer - can't stay the night or weekend somewhere without a dog sitter, sacrificing personal finances(for toys, food, emergencies, the things the dog will inevitably destroy during puppy teething/antics/training/accidents, etc), can't sleep in late anymore(dogs gotta pee), can't do a LOT without serious planning anymore. \n\nRegardless of people's opinions on \"pet parents\" or \"pet vs child\" debates, this VERY MUCH IS the equivalence of dumping a baby on someone and expecting them to be grateful for the upcoming DECADE+ of financial and personal responsibility that they have zero intentions to help with. Not to mention that in today's economy, a pet can be the difference between affording to eat/pay rent or not. What if the dog grows up to be TERRIBLE with children and you desperately want to be a parent? Now you either have to face the stigma and COSTS associated with rehoming a pet you never even wanted so you can have kids, or not having kids so you can keep the pet you never wanted in the first place. \n\nShe had *less than zero* right to do that to you. My verdict is that a little bit everyone sucks because you didn't need to call her out publicly the way you did. No is a full answer. \"I don't accept financial commitments disguised as presents\" is acceptable. \"I'd rather not be responsible for a surprise lifeform that I had no part in creating or choosing\" is also reasonable. You crossed into dickish-ness when you went with \"no because you're lazy and messy, and I don't want it.\" Regardless of your relationship, regardless of her intentions behind the (bluntly) terribly thought out \"gift\", you didn't need to have that conversation in front of everyone. \"Oh... No thank you. I don't want or have time for a dog. Please return it, as it will not be staying in this house\" and then take her somewhere privately to get personal if that's the route you end up taking. But dude... Personal call outs in public are pretty shitty unless well and truly earned.", "NTA. You cited all the correct reasons not to have a puppy.
