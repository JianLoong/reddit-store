He didn't understand (more like refuses to understand) that people weren't comfortable with HIM, not his porn preferences. \n\nTruth is, he was just a pervert and a dumbass. If you replace the graphics of hentai with real women, you'd be disgusted. But you think just because it's in 2D it makes it okay. \n\nIt really, really, really isn't.", "While the eye level coochie dangling in the car is just beyond, he displays a startling lack of awareness of what is appropriate to do in public. His \"anime titties\" t-shirts violate the boundaries of everyone he is forcing to look at them. There is something wrong with this guy. I'm frankly surprised he's employed. \n\nI'm ok with people liking porn, but I also find it concerning that he seems to have a need to surround himself with it all the time with no sense that other people may not want to be perpetually confronted with his masturbatory habits.", "Sweet summer child", "Her problem wasn't with it being public, though? Also, no mention of how visible it is from the outside.\n\nShe very clearly didn't make any boundaries with porn with this guy from the start, or even with the first incident of her being uncomfortable despite having an issue with it. Making her TA.", "Having your whole identity revolve around any one thing is not ideal, it's not restricted to just anime.", "It's funny, I've always thought men who are very much into hentai are emotionally immature. It says a lot about them, and it sounds like OPs boyfriend has gone beyond what we'd consider a kink.\n\nHaving the poster up and car thingy almost proves the emotionally immaturity because he's not considering other people's feelings, least of all the person he should respect the most.\n\nWe all have kinks, and shaming the is wrong. But this... This behaviour is something else.", "Yup...I'd be so gone!!", "She thinks him wanting to *publicly* broadcast his porn kink on his clothes and car is perverted.  And she is not wrong. Heck, whatever my OWN kink preferences are, having a poster of it on the wall in my home would make ME feel like a pervert.", "Wow. This post is *everything*.\n\nBrilliant analysis. Spot on.", "It\u2019s on his rear view mirror. She said it was swinging in her face. \n\n\nIf it\u2019s not private it\u2019s public. Hanging it from the rear view window of the car is not private. It\u2019s also not private to have it hanging on your wall if you live with anyone else.", "Speaking as a woman who enjoys consuming and makes pornographic content, your bf is a weirdo. This isn't even being prudish, because this is going far beyond just tasteful or artistic nudity.\n\nNo normal person would ever even consider hanging stuff like that up anywhere other than their private bedroom. Living room and car would be a hard no, and I'd question if that's not potentially breaking some laws too. I'm not saying it *is* against the law, but if it's in easy view of the public you are *asking* for a problem.\n\n*All that aside...* You didn't tell him to take it down. You told him it made you uncomfortable after he asked. He chose to take it down. You aren't being controlling. Not wanting to ride with him in the car where he's showing explicit sexual content all the time isn't controlling, it's setting a personal boundary.\n\nNTA", "You're still having sex with this guy? Girl, c'mon.", "There is a big difference between being a \u201ccontrolling gf\u201d and having boundaries. And this is a very VERY understandable boundary. I got the ick just reading this.

I will tell you the same thing I told my daughter-it\u2019s everyone\u2019s personal opinion but you don\u2019t have to be ok with it. And you don\u2019t have to be ok with a boyfriend watching it. If he\u2019s that in to it, you might want to rethink the relationship.", "Nta, if something is making you feel uncomfortable, always voice it. I can\u2019t actually believe you are with someone who has thing kind of stuff on display, I get anime and ok I kind of get hentai, but the latter is prob something I wouldn\u2019t like to see on display. To each their own, he can be into hentai and all sorts of kinks, I am not kinkshaming. A massive poster and a car pendant? Bound, taped With a \u2018dripping cooch\u2019?? Omg honey no.

I don\u2019t know you, but I do know you are better than *this.* Well adjusted, mentally healthy 30 year old men do not hang tied up and naked women in their cars. They do however, date women younger than them that don\u2019t know they shouldn\u2019t put up with this crap.", "Nta. That's porn. Animated porn and he's being really gross and disrespectful to wave that in your face and have private things posted on your wall and his car. I'd be so embarrassed to go anywhere with him and it's pretty cringey that he has a woman yet is plastering really graphic and perverted stuff everywhere. Cream pies are hot af.

He plays h-games constantly, reads and watches hentai, and always shows me his favourite characters.\n\nI'm asexual. Usually that's a full explanation of my sex life. \n\nWhen he moved in with me he finally got to express himself in his living space. As an Ace my home was entirely lacking in sex and nudity, and suddenly having it invaded by a big dude and a lot of porn was one hell of an upheaval. It's been about a year and we're still working out how to decorate together, but because we talked about it and had a few hard conversations we've started meeting in the middle.\n\nDon't have porn playing on the TV where the neighbours could hear it, don't just leave it open on the computer. Hey I'm playing this mobile game where you can almost entirely see a big tiddy nipple through their clothes; but I really think you'd like the art style and the story, so maybe play with me?\n\nIf you love this guy and want to make it work, or give it a go, have open and often communication. Write a list of what you're uncomfortable with and why. Try to look at things logically. \"You've welcomed me into your home and I think you want it to be OUR home, so can we talk about it?\"\n\nIf you approach it that way he might be happy to talk and work out a compromise.

I literally bought a tshirt from Spencer's yesterday that is the face down/ass up anime trope. \n\nBut I got it because my husband thinks it's hilarious (and I'm 46 btw, lots of irony).  If he didn't like it I certainly wouldn't dangle it from the rear view mirror.", "NTA", "NTA. Now, I follow some designers like hentai and Hennessy, Fakku, and iiii clothing.

Sorry to say, your boyfriend sounds like he\u2019s just a creep.", "NTA for setting boundaries but I am honestly curious if you really feel like you're going to be attracted to him long-term.

He\u2019s 30? Wearing that shit in public? C\u2019mon now\u2026what kind of grown ass man thinks this is appropriate?\n\nNTA. Serious conversation time.", "NTA.  These are reasonable requests, OP. There is nothing controlling or unreasonable about not wanting to look at it yourself.  If you aren't demanding he stop watching it on his own time without you, you're fine.", "This guy is weird op you deserve better", "Seriously though... I know you are trying to convince yourself that it isn't that big of a deal OP, but your boyfriend's porn tastes and obsession level is clearly a fundamental incompatibility between you guys. I don't know how to judge this, other than that you clearly need to see other people.", "Tons and tons of women still grow up in environments where they are told women exist to serve men, and that if they can't attach themselves to a man they've failed as women. \n\nSometimes I wonder how people *don't* understand how women like OP get in these situations... Why do you think women end up with men that are physically or emotionally abusive, for example? Ultimately it's the same. Patriarchy is alive and well and training women to grin and bare this behavior.", "It\u2019s so fricken repulsive. I cannot understand how any woman could give these creeps the time of day.", "You're allowed to say \"porn\"", "Agreed. This sounds like another part of how he gets off: he knows it makes people uncomfortable (\u201cnormies\u201d am I right /s) and might find it thrilling. \n\n\nIt\u2019s like perverts who send explicit pictures to strangers\u2019 phones via Airdrop.

When you say have you tried to have a conversation with him\" and talking about appropriate things, what make you think he will \" wake up\".\n\nI'm also not a fan of people jumping directly to break up conclusions when something is wrong, but this is something else. He looks like he's deeply into his addiction, and he knows that it's making OP very uncomfortable\n Yet , he never realized that and stopped by himself. She had to have him take down some decorations in the house.  \n\nDo you really think that a conversation will fix this?

I'd be upset too, because my train of thought would be \"what else do they think is weird that they aren't telling me?\" And rethinking the relationship.\nCommon sense says that? Imo it's more often insecurity that says that."]}
