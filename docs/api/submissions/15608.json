A lot of hentai revolves around one of two tropes which I find both frankly disgusting:\n- submissive young girls or helpless girls\n- mommy prawn with younger males \n(full disclosure as a female I've watched hentai but am no where obsessed and it's occasionally mixed in with reg prawn)\nLike they always play on tropes that are really taboo and I feel that much interest and dedication to it can be really unhealthy", "But it seems that his kink is bleeding into his real life, into his every day life, into your relationship. \n\nYou took the \"his business is his business and my business is my business\" very seriously, _too_ seriously. \n\nI knew someone who was just like your boyfriend; very very open with his hentai, even to his own parents and even business associates (for example, he would ask for their email and would whip out his phone with all that hentai wallpaper). \n\nThose who are heavily into hentai and makes it their entire personality comes with some .. baggage that most women are all too familiar with. \n\nAnyway, people are put off by my friend's behaviour and his cavelier attitude at showing hentai at everything. He thought that it's because he was misunderstood; he thought people didn't understand that he watches hentai for the plot, or that he's appreciating the hardwork of these animators. He went down a path of \"nice guy\" and almost crossed the bridge to incel. He didn't understand (more like refuses to understand) that people weren't comfortable with HIM, not his porn preferences. \n\nTruth is, he was just a pervert and a dumbass. If you replace the graphics of hentai with real women, you'd be disgusted. But you think just because it's in 2D it makes it okay. \n\nIt really, really, really isn't.", "While the eye level coochie dangling in the car is just beyond, he displays a startling lack of awareness of what is appropriate to do in public. His \"anime titties\" t-shirts violate the boundaries of everyone he is forcing to look at them. There is something wrong with this guy. I'm frankly surprised he's employed. \n\nI'm ok with people liking porn, but I also find it concerning that he seems to have a need to surround himself with it all the time with no sense that other people may not want to be perpetually confronted with his masturbatory habits.", "Sweet summer child", "Her problem wasn't with it being public, though? Also, no mention of how visible it is from the outside.\n\nShe very clearly didn't make any boundaries with porn with this guy from the start, or even with the first incident of her being uncomfortable despite having an issue with it. Making her TA.", "Having your whole identity revolve around any one thing is not ideal, it's not restricted to just anime.", "It's funny, I've always thought men who are very much into hentai are emotionally immature. It says a lot about them, and it sounds like OPs boyfriend has gone beyond what we'd consider a kink.\n\nHaving the poster up and car thingy almost proves the emotionally immaturity because he's not considering other people's feelings, least of all the person he should respect the most.\n\nWe all have kinks, and shaming the is wrong. But this... This behaviour is something else.", "Yup...I'd be so gone!!", "She thinks him wanting to *publicly* broadcast his porn kink on his clothes and car is perverted.  And she is not wrong. Heck, whatever my OWN kink preferences are, having a poster of it on the wall in my home would make ME feel like a pervert.", "Wow. This post is *everything*.\n\nBrilliant analysis. Spot on.", "It\u2019s on his rear view mirror. She said it was swinging in her face. \n\n\nIf it\u2019s not private it\u2019s public. Hanging it from the rear view window of the car is not private. It\u2019s also not private to have it hanging on your wall if you live with anyone else."]}
