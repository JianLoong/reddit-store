A lot of hentai revolves around one of two tropes which I find both frankly disgusting:\n- submissive young girls or helpless girls\n- mommy prawn with younger males \n(full disclosure as a female I've watched hentai but am no where obsessed and it's occasionally mixed in with reg prawn)\nLike they always play on tropes that are really taboo and I feel that much interest and dedication to it can be really unhealthy", "But it seems that his kink is bleeding into his real life, into his every day life, into your relationship. \n\nYou took the \"his business is his business and my business is my business\" very seriously, _too_ seriously. \n\nI knew someone who was just like your boyfriend; very very open with his hentai, even to his own parents and even business associates (for example, he would ask for their email and would whip out his phone with all that hentai wallpaper). \n\nThose who are heavily into hentai and makes it their entire personality comes with some .. baggage that most women are all too familiar with. \n\nAnyway, people are put off by my friend's behaviour and his cavelier attitude at showing hentai at everything.

Just because it\u2019s a drawing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not pornography! \n\nIt\u2019s thoughtful of you to give your boyfriend some space for this as it is art, but art can be pornographic too. Things can be two things!\n\nFor context, some of the most famous artists have bodies of work considered to be is too erotic for genera display. Not that I\u2019m making a comparison, but the images you describe sound pretty graphic and best enjoyed privately! If you wouldn\u2019t be OK with him displaying a photo like that, you shouldn\u2019t be OK with him displaying art like that. Trust your instincts! Your boyfriend should respect your boundaries.\n\nObscenity, particularly pornography is famously tricky to define, which is one of the only reasons it\u2019s not flat out illegal to display images like hardcore hentai in parts of the USA. Even the US Supreme Court has struggled, eventually ruling \u201cyou know it when you see it.\u201d So, in most societies we have agreed on a standard of what is OK to display and what should be kept discreet. \n\nBased on your post, it seems like your boyfriend is comfortable rejecting your society\u2019s standards. No matter how much he loves hentai, he knows very well where that social line is because it\u2019s evidenced all around him! I\u2019m assuming, anyway, that most of his life he\u2019s surrounded by\u2026 not porn. I didn\u2019t know they had stickers now. Somebody who seeks out fucking stickers knows what they\u2019re doing, I wouldn\u2019t let him tell me [27f] otherwise.\n\nPushing some of society\u2019s standards and norms is healthy! Exposing somebody to pornography without their consent is not one of those. Porn has plenty of links to sexual violence, and what can be enjoyed harmlessly by one can be damaging to another. It\u2019s not cool to unwillingly expose others to something like this.\n\nIf displaying pornography is important enough to your man that he\u2019s struggling to compromise with your needs, he can tell you like a grown up. Then, you can decide together if you want to renegotiate the boundary and how. Making an independent choice to expose you to something you have clearly told him makes you uncomfortable, and then sulking when you managed something nicer than \u201cI thought I said to keep that shit out of my face, now pull over\u201d is manipulative.\n\ntldr\u2014 YOU WOULD NOT BE TA IF THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU ASKED. But the fact that you set clear and reasonable boundaries and he then chose to push you, his girlfriend, makes HIM THE ASSHOLE. \n\nRemember, it\u2019s not just art. It\u2019s pornographic art. You\u2019re not critiquing line-work, you\u2019re reacting to depictions of sexual acts. Or even suggestive depictions! If it\u2019s too much for you, you\u2019ll know it when you see it.
