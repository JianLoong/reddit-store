So it's not you who cause the tension in your relationship it's him. It's perfectly normal to not like every food.", "NTA.\n\nI love eggs.  But you can't make someone eat and like something you have a visceral reaction too.", "NTA why do you have to eat the same meals? Seems unreasonable to pressure you into liking eggs.", "NTA. You are not causing the problem. Your boyfriend is being very rigid in insisting, for no particular reason, that you must always eat the same meals.", "NTA. Having gone through similar with a BF many years ago and now having the benefit of hindsight, focussing on the one food you do not want to eat and repeatedly trying to make you eat it is controlling and weird.", "NTA - you don't like eggs. It's not the end of the world, you haven't banned them from the house. Your boyfriend needs a reality check for making such a fuss about this. I'm with you I can't stand eggs, but my partner loves them. I cook them for him, he thinks it's amazing that I don't eat them but can make him a dippy egg when he's feeling a bit down.", "NTA.

By all means have meals together but you don't need to share EVERY single meal. He can have eggs on meals that you aren't sharing.\n\nCould always show him Dominion. Unless you get backyard eggs, the was the hens that laid those eggs were treated was horrific. I personally don't eat birds and only eat eggs that my own hens laid because I know they have a good quality of life.\n\nOn that subject, are you able too acomodate backtyard hens? Their eggs taste a lott better than store bought ones.\n\nSorry if I'm going on like that vegan teacher. I'm no vegan, call me a hypocrit if you want, but I like birds, the way chickens are treated is horrific and ducks are treated even worse. Red meat though? I wan't moved by that. Nothing I love more than some bacon or lorne sausage that may or may not have been gassed with some eggs that I know are cruelty free. \n\nI play a bit of GW2, Anyone who is on Piken Square might have thought I was gonna change to their server, \"He must be vegan!\" Nah, I just care about birds and what happens to them more than i care about other farmed animals. i'll have that beef medallion steak I have in the fridge and I'll have it rare.", "You\u2019re not the one causing tension my friend.

Also be more insistent that he continues to eat them if they mean that much to him, he can just leave you out of it.", "NTA and this is an odd controlling behaviour that I\u2019ve experienced in a relationship myself. With my ex, it was mustard. He was obsessed with trying to make me eat mustard and trying to make me LIKE mustard. I never got to the bottom of WTF his problem was, but it was soooooo important to him to get me eating mustard, he would even try to hide it in food he made for me, act smug if he used so little that I couldn\u2019t taste and therefore ate the mustard-tainted food without complaint, and took it strangely personally that I didn\u2019t like and didn\u2019t want goddamn mustard. It still baffles me to this day. He did turn out to be insanely controlling in every other conceivable way in the end, so I would hazard that it wasn\u2019t really about the mustard in his case and isn\u2019t really about eggs (or Iranian yogurt) in yours, so suggest you watch your step. I think even if he got you to start eating eggs, then his fixation would transfer to something else. Be careful. Maybe he\u2019s just a weirdo, but be careful just the same.", "NTA - This is absurd. Your BF needs to chill out and just eat his eggs. You two can still eat together without eating the exact same thing. Him threatening to end the relationship over this is manipulative. You two need to have a serious conversation about boundaries and communication. But his behavior is really troubling and I am not sure the relationship is salvageable. \n\nAlso - go to the doctor and get tested for an egg allergy. Egg allergies are fairly common. Sometimes a strong aversion to a food, especially if it causes vomiting, can actually be a mild allergy. And (depending on age, food, the person), repeated exposure can increase the allergy.", "NTA. He is the AH for trying to pressure you into eating something he knows you don't eat. \n\nYou've made clear that you are happy for him to eat them, it's now up to him whether he prefers to have a situation where sometimes you aren't eating the same thing or if he prefers not to eat eggs unless you are not there.  Those are two totally reasonable options for him but he's seeking to bully you into the third option which gives him 1005 of what he wants, and you 0% % of what you want. \n\nStop trying the eggs he buys. Next time, just tell him \"Not for me, thanks, but you go ahead ad enjoy them\" \n\nYou can even say to him \"Why is it so important to you that I should eat eggs? I'm not judging you for liking them, I'm not asking you to give them up, why can you not respect the fact that I have tried multiple types of eggs prepared in multiple kinds of ways and I just don't like them?\"\n\nsharing meals it great, but that doesn't mean you need to eat the exact same thing, the bonding is about taking time to be together. Plus, there are lots of dishes where you can be eating most of the same stuff but his plate includes eggs and yours doesn't\n\nMy sister is like you, she can eat baked goods made with eggs but can't eat eggs themselves in any form. And so we, and now her partner and his Family  recognise that she doesn't eat eggs. If I cook something that would normally involve eggs I'll make a portion without for her, or I'll serve the egg separately, depending which works better, or if I was planning to make an omelets I'll change my plans or offer her an alternative. It's no big deal. \n\nWhat i a big deal, is your BF's controlling behaviour and his apparent belief that you can change you likes and dislikes just by trying.  You've given it a fair try, you know it isn't just that your primary care giver as a child only ever served eggs over cooked to the texture of vulcanised rubber, and that if you had a chance to try really well made scrambled eggs you would learn they were edible after all, you just - don't like eggs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake a look at this relationship, is your BF controlling in other ways? How much does he expect you to change or compromise to meet his expectation, and how much does he change or compromise for your preferences and tastes?", "NTA it is OK to go your whole life and never eat an egg. \n\nYou are not blocking him from eating eggs.

NTA. The fact that you even need to ask is sad. Is he controlling in general, or is it literally just the eggs? Bigger issues here for sure.", "NTA \nThe irony in this is that what your boyfriend is accusing you of doing (forcing him to change something about himself to placate you) is exactly what HE is doing. It seems like he\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty for not subscribing to the same exact habits he has, and then is trying to weaponize your relationship/this guilt he\u2019s attempting to manufacture in order to change you. If he\u2019s this controlling about something as small as what foods you like, I\u2019d be terrified to see what else he tries to control in the future.", "NTA.

That's really not up to you.\n\nTotally fine to not like eggs. Totally weird for BF to be insistent that you try them.\n\n\"BF, I don't like eggs and experience suggests I never will. We don't need to eat the exact same thjngs all the time to have a strong relationship. Feel free to have eggs whenever you want, but from now on, no eggs for me.\"", "LOL! You took the words (\"weird and controlling\") right out of my mouth.", "Thank you so much for the insight. Your assumption about what happens when we like different TV shows is  true. I felt like I was going crazy so hearing that his behaviour is irrational gives me perspective I needed", "Those are the two items that stood out to me--\"sacrificing eggs\" and 'you MUST eat the eggs!'. Also: \n\n>he feels it's important for us to eat the same meals together.\n\nSo, he's never been to a restaurant? Does he think couples and families go out to eat, all order burgers and all order the *exact same burger*...and all must get French fries, onion rings be damned? Only ketchup, mustard is forbidden? \n\nAbsolute wackadoo. NTA", "Lol, it's real and has caused many fights. I made a throwaway because I don't want my boyfriend finding this.", "Sweetheart, I'm really sorry this has happened to you. No, you're not stupid and you're certainly not a villain.\n\nBut you desperately need to raise your standards. You deserve better than being with someone who holds you as less important to him than an *egg.* \n\nWhen someone is willing to die on such a tiny hill, they definitely don't care about you. You can quite easily go through life without eating eggs. You can quite easily be in a relationship with someone who doesn't like foods you like and vice versa. My husband hates pineapple and I love it. Yes it's a shame I never make pineapple based dishes for us, but you know what? I get over it. My husband is a billion times more important to me than pineapple, and besides, I have other friends. If I want to make something with pineapple I can just give it to them.\n\nNTA", "Don't feel stupid, but if your bf is making you feel that then again, do look at this relationship, that sounds like a form of gaslighting, where he is bullying you and behaving i an objectively unreasonable way, but is trying to convince you that you are the one who is in the wrong.", "of course! I have definitely been there as well, and while I\u2019m sure he cares about you, he is inherently a little selfish. I hope you are able to open his eyes and your patience with his behavior, even he might not deserve it sometimes, shows that you are a loving and caring person. I hope everything works out for you!"]}
