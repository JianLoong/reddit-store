He moved in with me after his job transferred him to a branch close to where I live, so we decided it was a good time to move in together 6 months ago.\n\nI have an Autoimmune disease, that requires me to take medications to keep it under control, part of them are strong immunosuppressants (the kind people usually get after a kidney or heart transplant). The diagnosis came suddenly after I ended up in the hospital with fever and came to a point of fighting for my life within a short period of time.\n\nHis mother doesn\u2019t believe in modern medication and is of strict opinion that essential oils and herbs can do the job just as well. It never bothered me, since she doesn\u2019t live with us. She lives about an hour away from us. Last time she visited us, she threw away my weekly dosage container which I kept in the kitchen next to the coffee machine. Though it became an argument, I let it go because my boyfriend and his father apologised on her behalf.\n\nShe got divorced recently and my boyfriend asked if she could spend the new years with us, since we don\u2019t celebrate Christmas (I\u2019m Hindu and he\u2019s Bhuddist), and she\u2019s been going through a hard time since his father left her. I agreed. We had a guest room where she could stay. Knowing about her, I put my unopened medicines in a safe I have in the basement (fyi I have not told my boyfriend about this safe).\n\nFast forward to New Year\u2019s Eve, I went to my drawer in my home office to take my evening medications, where I kept my opened boxes of meds and just to see all my medications was gone. I flipped out and asked my boyfriend about my medications only for his mother to come and tell with an ignorant attitude that she threw them all away because those are toxic chemicals that I\u2019m swallowing and my illness is just an excuse I\u2019m using to gain sympathy from those around me. I flipped out and shouted at her that she has no rights to get into my office and throw my medications away that are potentially keeping me alive. My boyfriend decided to take his mother\u2019s side and told me to calm down and that I was overreacting and his mother only did what\u2019s best for me and that my illness couldn\u2019t be that serious anyways since I\u2019m working full time. I told him to shut the f*** up. The argument got more and more heated, to a point where I told them both to get out. I then got my stash out of the basement and took my evening medications.\n\nI gave my boyfriend an eviction notice and broke things off with him.\n\nMy phone has been blowing off since then with his family members calling me an AH and a drama queen for breaking it off for such a petty thing. His father is the only one on my side and reassured that I did the right thing and advised me to get a restraining order.\n\nBut over the past few days I\u2019ve been wondering if I reacted too harsh since I had a hidden stash.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1673720601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bve0c/aita_for_kicking_my_boyfriend_and_his_mother_out/", "score": 782, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
