He moved in with me after his job transferred him to a branch close to where I live, so we decided it was a good time to move in together 6 months ago.\n\nI have an Autoimmune disease, that requires me to take medications to keep it under control, part of them are strong immunosuppressants (the kind people usually get after a kidney or heart transplant). The diagnosis came suddenly after I ended up in the hospital with fever and came to a point of fighting for my life within a short period of time.\n\nHis mother doesn\u2019t believe in modern medication and is of strict opinion that essential oils and herbs can do the job just as well. It never bothered me, since she doesn\u2019t live with us. She lives about an hour away from us. Last time she visited us, she threw away my weekly dosage container which I kept in the kitchen next to the coffee machine. Though it became an argument, I let it go because my boyfriend and his father apologised on her behalf.\n\nShe got divorced recently and my boyfriend asked if she could spend the new years with us, since we don\u2019t celebrate Christmas (I\u2019m Hindu and he\u2019s Bhuddist), and she\u2019s been going through a hard time since his father left her. I agreed. We had a guest room where she could stay. Knowing about her, I put my unopened medicines in a safe I have in the basement (fyi I have not told my boyfriend about this safe).\n\nFast forward to New Year\u2019s Eve, I went to my drawer in my home office to take my evening medications, where I kept my opened boxes of meds and just to see all my medications was gone. I flipped out and asked my boyfriend about my medications only for his mother to come and tell with an ignorant attitude that she threw them all away because those are toxic chemicals that I\u2019m swallowing and my illness is just an excuse I\u2019m using to gain sympathy from those around me. I flipped out and shouted at her that she has no rights to get into my office and throw my medications away that are potentially keeping me alive. My boyfriend decided to take his mother\u2019s side and told me to calm down and that I was overreacting and his mother only did what\u2019s best for me and that my illness couldn\u2019t be that serious anyways since I\u2019m working full time. I told him to shut the f*** up. The argument got more and more heated, to a point where I told them both to get out. I then got my stash out of the basement and took my evening medications.\n\nI gave my boyfriend an eviction notice and broke things off with him.\n\nMy phone has been blowing off since then with his family members calling me an AH and a drama queen for breaking it off for such a petty thing. His father is the only one on my side and reassured that I did the right thing and advised me to get a restraining order.\n\nBut over the past few days I\u2019ve been wondering if I reacted too harsh since I had a hidden stash.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1673720601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bve0c/aita_for_kicking_my_boyfriend_and_his_mother_out/", "score": 489, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re able to work full time because you take medication. \n\nShe invaded your privacy, stole from you, endangered your health and your boyfriend not only allowed it but doubled down. \n\nWhy would you want a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t respect you?", "NTA", "A petty thing? Throwing out medicines that you need because of her dumbass unscientific and uninformed beliefs are petty? Just frigging ridiculous. You're absolutely NTA and I'm glad you had another stash.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t look back. You made the right decision.", "Nta. With all the supply chain issues and costs, she really can harm you.", "Scary.\nYou could have died. If it was insulin, or heart meds... omg. Omg. \nWtaf. And meds are EXPENSIVE. If my MIL did that I'd be in jail for assault. Nta", "NTA HELL NO. You should be even madder. They didn't know you had a stash, they tossed what they though were you only pills. Meaning they chose to be so stupid to put your life at risk. These are pills you need to live. Anyone who is coming after you, if you want to explain that. \n\nEven on the off chance you were \"faking it\" thats not up to them to decide to throw your stuff away. This would have come up sooner or later, lets be glad it was sooner.", "NTA. She went snooping through your office and threw away medication that you paid for. If you didn't have a stash you would have missed doses.", "NTA. Dear gods, she wants to kill you and he would let her. Get them both out of your life, and have no regrets at all, except for letting them in. Good luck to you, I hope your health improves. If they push you, reporting her to the police is the way to go.", "NTA.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t respect your health needs (which are supported by a dr).\n\nShe put your health at risk.\n\nShe went into your office without permission.\n\nShe went into your desk without permission.\n\nShe threw out your property without your permission.\n\nYou are NTA.  Glad to hear you broke up with him too.  He clearly didn\u2019t respect your health either.", "NTA\n\nI mean dang! My mom has an autoimmune and if she didn't have insurance and a couple grants her 1 once a week med would be almost $250,000 a year. But that's another bad US healthcare issue.\n\nBfs mom is super wrong and bf is too. Good to know now before he'd have the \"right\" to your medical decisions", "NTA and follow his dad\u2019s advice. They sound dangerous and batshit crazy.", "Holy crap!! I am SO RELIEVED that you have broken up with this awful man! Good riddance though his entire family and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still here and able to tell us this terrible tale!", "NTA.   \nTwo things\n\n1) Press charges. If these meds are keeping you alive, then they're trying to kill you  \n2) If the bf has been living there for a while, he has tenant rights that could end up foiling your eviction notice. Make sure everything you're doing to get rid of these people is legal because we know they don't respect you and will try to harm you.", "NTA at all! I'm always so happy on these posts when the OP has already tossed the trash out too, good on you.", "NTA. Your medicine is keeping you alive, she threw away your life support. She willingly could have killed you and your now ex thought that was acceptable. Neither of them value your life, you did not overreact", "NTA, and i have to say OP, you are a god damn saint. If someone did this with my insulin there would be murder so i honestly dont understand how you kept your cool. Good on you for removing them from your life and i wish you luck in future romantic endeavours", "NTA: Ex-Bf's mom has no right to act like she knows better than a doctor, and took it upon herself to throw away your medications. She is a boundary stomper and her son has no spine. It's okay to play with your own health and believe in BS herbs and oils. But it's not okay to push that on others and tamper with their treatment. Oils and herbs do not treat autoimmune disorders. I would block them on your phone and if they continue to harass you, give them a cease and desist warning.", "NTA. I have a rare autoimmune disorder. I\u2019m sure you know how much unsolicited medical advice I\u2019ve gotten from people who aren\u2019t medical professionals. I would be dead if I\u2019d followed advice to take herbs that interact with my medication, take half the prescribed dosage of my medication, etc. \n\nThankfully, my husband supports my view that if you didn\u2019t go to med school, I\u2019m not interested in getting medical advice from you.\n\nIf I were you, I would file charges against your ex-boyfriend\u2019s mother. It\u2019s possible that she\u2019s selling your medication.", "NTA \n\nThe disrespect and boundaries crossed is insane. \n\nI will however acknowledge that if it wasn\u2019t for his overstepping mother , you wouldn\u2019t have learned that he doesn't understand the seriousness of your illness.", "There\u2019s a lot of \ud83d\udea9\u2018s here.\n\n\u2022Stealing from you in your own home. Stealing is never ok but it\u2019s worse to steal from someone who has opened their home to you.\n\n\u2022Depriving you of your prescribed medications. She is not a doctor, she doesn\u2019t get to decide which meds you need.\n\n\u2022Trying to force her will for your health on you. This is a level of controlling that won\u2019t get better. If you had kids with this man, imagine how controlling she would be over how you raise them.\n\n\u2022Gaslighting you about your own illness and suggesting it isn\u2019t real and a ploy for sympathy.\n\n\u2022The BF siding with his mom.\n\n\u2022The BF also suggesting your illness isn\u2019t that bad because you (checks notes) have a job?? I mean, WHAT? I\u2019ve known people with terminal cancer who still had a job. They weren\u2019t any less terminal because of it. \n\n\u2022Both of them suggesting you\u2019re overreacting when you\u2019re having a totally normal and understandable reaction to a terrible violation of your rights and your privacy.\n\nIf it was me I would have called the police and filed a police report.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You did not over react. She would have thrown out the hidden stash also.  She has no right to interfere in your medication regimen and you could charge her attempted murder since it keeps you alive.   As for your boyfriend, I hope he learns from this.  How dare he, his mother and flying monkies downplay the situation like this?   I have a life long illness myself and everyone downplayed it.  My niece and my mother were ticked off at these people. It's worse when it's family.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to end things with someone who thinks you are lying about your illness, and has no problem with their parent snooping, then destroying medication (which cost you money.)\n\nYou didn\u2019t overreact, and you having secured medication in a safe doesn\u2019t change how fucked up your ex\u2019s and his mother\u2019s behavior here is.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is petty.\n\nThis is about a lack of respect for you.", "NTA omg what a nightmare woman, you dodged a bullet.", "NTA.  This was New Year's Eve.  Pharmacies are closed on New Year's Day.  OP's MIL could have killed her.  You should have pressed charges for assault.  Stealing life-sustaining medication qualifies.  You can't risk staying with your BF if he's going to believe his lunatic mother's opinion about your disease being a cry for attention.  Kick them both to the curb, and find a BF whose mother believes in science and boundaries.", "NTA my husband had a kidney transplant, those meds are not only expensive and life saving but they're prescription, you should have called the police on her.", "NTA Sue your boyfriend's mother for the cost of the medication.", "Yeeesh no wonder why her husband left lol, NTA, throw the buttholes to the curb.", "Oh hell no- she would have paid for the replacements or I would have called the police and reported the theft.", "NTA\n\nStart dating the dad.\n\nSeriously press charges, depending where you are and the severity of your illness its illegal to throw away needed medication. Also depending on your medication, you may not be able to get a refill before you run out.\n\nCHANGE YOUR LOCKS!\n\nGet cameras.", "I would die in about a week if someone took my meds. Please call the police. Taking someone else\u2019s meds is a felony.", "NTA at all.  The ex and the mother compromised your health, and even your life.  The whole going through your office will be sufficient reason.  Stand by your decision, you dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Well done on kicking both out!!", "NTA!!!! For so many reasons. Those medicines are no joke and need to be taken regularly. They can also be expensive AF! She can reimburse you for all of them and you are way better off without that psycho in your life.", "NTA \nThe fact that you needed to keep a hidden stash in the first place is red flags waving all over the place.", "WHAT?!?! NTA AT ALL. Get them arrested and a restraining order. Throwing someone\u2019s SERIOUS MEDICATION away? AND SAYING THEIR DIAGNOSIS WAS FAKE? I would need to be the one arrested for attempted murder atp.", "NTA But on top of everything else, how much did you pay for your meds? I'm on multiple meds and even with insurance a lot of that shit isn't cheap. They're lucky you aren't asking them to reimburse you for the cost.", "NTA. I work full-time too. I also have a life-threatening disease that I have to take multiple medications for. If I don't take my meds every day, I will end up in the hospital and I will die. Your boyfriend's mother literally risked your life. And your boyfriend defended her. Change the locks I would press charges against her for theft.", "Or even \u2014 if in the US \u2014 insurance refusing to pay for replacements yet again. This could be *extremely* expensive, and if so, I\u2019d say file a lawsuit against BF-Momma for the cost.", "For sure - I once misplaced my meds and went to buy more from the pharmacy. I figured insurance wouldn't cover it (and fair enough, my fault) so I was going to pay for it myself. Then the pharmacy told me how much it was. I decided to look harder and ultimately found it! It is often extremely not cheap, even if the meds aren't restricted."]}
