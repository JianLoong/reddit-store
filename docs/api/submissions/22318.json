I was emotional, hoping we would still find a solution (losing her as a friend hurts like hell) and getting carried away with occupying the moral high ground ... Many more details to this story are unfortunately lost due to character limit.", "Thanks, that is my feeling exactly. I feel we haven't gotten to the real reason yet. But I'm also not sure if she knows the real reason and is not telling me or if there is something she is not aware of and just projecting.", "I also have no idea if she was just speaking for herself or them both, but my gut feeling is that it is just her. I think John is just staying out of it to not be caught in the middle as he seemed to have no problem with the whole money thing. I also don't get why she is kicking up such a fuss when it was clear that John and I would both pay more than her.", "I thought it was a unicorn poaching trip with OP as the prey.", "Thanks.", "Haha! Glad it happened now and not someplace 1,000 km away.", "True.", "NTA - no trip, no pay.     \n     \nNot everyone here is OPs friend.", "I'm not sure I understand what you mean.", "Because apparently I am an idiot sometimes. I was emotional and felt it was the right thing to do (moral high ground and such). Could have kicked my ass the next day. But the fact that she didn't say \"Of course I don't expect you to pay anything\" was the most valuable lesson in all this. That's when I was truly done even though I hate going back on my word.", "Tbh, I don't think John has problems paying for the house by himself. I know that he did so in the past when they were traveling with their kids (patchwork family, both have 2). With me joining them, it would have been a less expensive vacation than before, without me it might add to the same amount he's used to paying. Plus they won't have to pay for food for 6 people. So all in all this might end up being less expensive than past vacations.", "Yeah, I'm also thinking we haven't yet gotten to the root of it. John is very straightforward and I'm pretty sure he would have told me if he was bothered. It was also really weird that she never picked up the phone or sent me a text. Instead it was rather formal-sounding emails all the way.\n\nEdit: I was looking forward to going. My beloved old convertible is dying, so instead of buying a new one I now got a (smaller) SUV so the loooong drive would be more comfortable for me and my dog. I was just really busy to make it all happen. 10-day trip (also with more than 1,000 miles+ driving), 2 weeks at home, working my butt off to get everything done, 5-day business trip, 1 night at home and then back in the car. Super stressful. She knew all that but also not once asked how everything was going or if I was okay.", "Despite being a close friend, there is a history of putting responsibility on me when things don't go the way she thinks they should. Haven't talked for a while? Always my mistake. I recently pointed out to her that I called her and it took her 5 days to get back to me. Surprised Pikachu face. She has called me out for similar behavior (taking one or two days to reply to a text) numerous times. I think there is a real possibility it just didn't register with her that I raised the issue several times. I know that fighting about money can blow up vacations and friendships, that's why I made a conscious effort to mention it. My gut feeling is that John does not have an issue with this whole thing or me. I think he would have contacted me if he was really upset. Actually, I sent him a message at the beginning of June telling him to please give me his account number. He then told me that Jane wanted to meet (to discuss the whole appreciation/commitment thing which I didn't know about at that point) and that we would sort it out after. He had 4 months to give me his account number and never did, so I'm guessing he wasn't really bothered.", "That was my first thought.", "Some people enjoy the act of fighting. They\u2019re good at it. They like upsetting people and getting sympathy. My ex would try or organize situations where she could pick a fight and I\u2019d see them coming and do what I could to derail her plan, in the sense of peacekeeping. \n\nNow I ignore it and let her be upset.", "Text them both. Reiterate the situation and then tell them because Jane uninvited you, you will not be paying. Then let them have whatever argument they seem to be having between themselves.", "That's what I thought lol. Idk why a couple is inviting 1 single person with them on vacation. \n\nOp don't go and don't pay anything. Just make it clear it was a miscommunication and that they should enjoy their vacation", "Haha! Sorry, gotta go and poop some rainbows.", "Sometimes ya gotta keep the argument simple", "They\u2019re asking why you volunteered to pay for a trip you\u2019re not going on.", "Yeah, just talk it out. Be very frank about your point of view and why you're confused or hurt about what she's telling you. Ask her to explain her point of view very clearly because you're not seeing the situation through the same lens as she is. I'm sure I don't have to say this, but don't be accusatory or angry when you bring it up, just honest. I'd also suggest face to face if you have time.\n\nHope you work it out :)", "This reminds me of a former friend who\u2019s call ME out for the same behaviour they\u2019d exhibit themselves. \n\nJust as you did, I would point out specific occasions where they did the very thing they accused me and\u2026 silence. Her partner was also the easygoing quiet type.\n\nSaid friend dumped me over some false accusations.  It was hurtful in the beginning but  I realise I\u2019m better off, since I remembered all the BS I tolerated in the name of friendship", "She's not shown behavior like that before and I'm completely dumbfounded. She's also a therapist ... so at least in theory, she should know better.", "Thanks, I might do that. I feel a bit sorry for John though as he will now be carrying most of the financial burden.", "We were close. I know and really like their kids (both have 2 from previous relationships) and it felt a bit like family. Nothing weird about it, I was touched they asked me. I'm single and often travel alone. They also have a dog, so it seemed like a perfect match. Sharing the cost also would have allowed me to stay in a vacation home I wouldn't/couldn't pay for by myself.", "Thanks :). Because we booked the house together, and I hate going back on my word. Her wording did not sound final at that point (\"My gut feeling right now is ...\") and I did not want to burn all bridges. Also because I'm stupid :). Her definitely calling it off two days later made things clearer.", "Thanks <3. At this point, however, I'm not sure if I even want to anymore. I told her that I need time to think about everything. I have to find out how much this friendship is worth to me, emotionally and financially. Not paying anything means burning all bridges, I guess that's why I'm hesitant. I was very frank about my point of view and my emotions, and she said she was sorry I felt pain (but took no responsibility for causing it). I guess I'm still mostly flabbergasted about this whole drama.", "Sounds eerily similar. Sorry this happened to you and thanks for sharing!", "I\u2019d fade her out.", "Sure but that's their problem to deal with. They uninvited you so that means they have to pay all the costs. If john is unhappy about that he needs to deal with Jane.", "You didn\u2019t go back on your word, she uninvited you. She literally wants you now to subsidize their beach house because reasons???? \n\nAlso, you never should have offered to pay more than your share. Frankly since you weren\u2019t getting a bedroom, you should have paid less. They were taking advantage of you from the get go.", "> I have to find out how much this friendship is worth to me, emotionally and financially. \n\nFair enough. Sorry about the situation.", "Good point.", "NTA.  Sounds like John was edging you out while not speaking to your friend.  I assume he had some sob story about you not paying even though you were asking.", "$0 sound about right to me. Also sending proof that you asked and leaving it at that.", "YTA to yourself\n\nWhy are you letting them treat you this way? They clearly never intended for you to actually go and just want you to subsidise their trip.\n\nSend them a penny, and when they complain, say its for the thought.", "What more involvement was needed after you booked the place and tried to pay her? Why need more togetherness beforehand when you're going to be together for 10 days? And why should you pay more for not even getting your own room? This screams nightmare. Don't go and don't pay. NTA.", "YWNBTA, don\u2019t pay a single penny. You\u2019re not going, they uninvited you so you have no obligations to pay for something you\u2019re no longer a part of", "NTA, with the lack of account number and sounds like countless amount of declines for your money, it sounds like they\u2019ve been wanting to uninvite you for awhile but didn\u2019t have the guts to do so. So the friend made some sort of \u201cissue\u201d arise", "This is how arguments with friends about money should go: True story, I was buying my friend's daughter's bike for my daughter.\n\nMe: Could I give you \u00a350 for the bike?\n\nFriend: No, no, that is too much. \u00a310 is good.\n\nMe: How about I give you \u00a340?\n\nFriend: Maybe \u00a320.\n\nMe: let's meet in the middle. \u00a330.\n\nFriend: OK, \u00a330.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA but these friends are AH.", "NTA. Seeing as there was no actual bedroom for you to stay in I personally 100% would not pay. Your friends haven\u2019t paid extra for a larger place to accommodate you, instead it\u2019s just enough for them.", "NTA. If you're not going you shouldn't pay them anything.", "NTA do not pay. Also, there is something going on in their relationship, and you are better off staying away from it.", "NTA for not paying, but you need to learn to stand up for yourself. You were willing to put up with so many inconveniences and yet you were so eager to throw money in your friend's direction, even going as far as paying way more than your fair share.\n\nI would have refused to join them after they changed the date and there was no room for me.", "NTA! Skip the vacation, skip the payment. There is nowhere for you to sleep, and at least one of the people you would be going on holiday with is being actively nasty.", "YWNBTA\n\n$0 is an excellent number. If you're not welcome on the vacation, your money should stay in your pocket.", "Why would you pay for them to go on vacation.", "She literally replied to my email (to both of them) asking for his account number criticizing me for not ever asking for his account number :).", "Thanks. They have proof. That's why she suddenly let it go in her second email.", "How does that even make sense? If they just wanted to rip me off, they would have taken my money the first time I offered and ditched me after. At this point, they do not have a single cent of my money and no way to force me as my name is not on the contract.", "Thanks. I have asked myself these exact questions and still have no idea what she expected me to do. Apparently, working my butt off to be able to enjoy this vacation and not having to work every single day while I was there didn't count.", "Thanks!", "Maybe that's it. I have a feeling that John didn't really care about the money and probably just forgot to give me the account # but that something changed for her after the last time we met and she pushed the issue.", "Love it! This is exactly how arguments in my family go :). Currently trying to win against one of my sisters. I gave her 15 bucks (don't even remember what it was for), and she snuck them back into my bag. Next time I was over I hid them at her place.  She put the money back when we met at my other sister's house a week later. Now it's my turn again.", "To be fair: none of us noticed when we booked it. The gallery is big and offers visual but no acoustic privacy. I could have lived with that as the house and the surroundings are stunning and I fell in love with the place.", "I just need to point out that \"togetherness\" before a vacation is a completely bonkers concept that does not relate to any normal friendship stuff. She's playing you or she's a very unwell person. You book a vacation, you show up on the vacation. That's the commitment. There's no pre-vacation bonding needed.", "I don't know why you are hurt by losing her as a friend, since she sounds awful", "It works because they've now made it your fault. They're requesting you pay while also guilting you for being the problem by not being 'active' enough. It's a very manipulative thing to have done, but also quite common. They picked a one bedroom on purpose. They were deliberately evasive with you about paying until they started saying you shouldn't come, and now they want money. The idea is to make you worry about losing their friendship so you hand over cash, and then they magnanimously accept your cash and 'forgive' you. You feel relieved, they get a subsidised holiday.", "Honestly, I also thought it was weird. I'm not responsible for her feeling joy or anticipation. I had trouble putting it into words because a) I still don't know exactly what she meant and b) I have no idea what she expected me to do. Sending a countdown every day? Videos of me jumping up and down? Btw, I'm gonna borrow \"pre-vacation bonding\", thanks for that.  \nEdit: added a word I forgot", "Until this email, she wasn't. A little difficult sometimes, but definitely not awful. We've been through tough times together. That's why I'm so hurt and dumbfounded.", "You mentioned her income hasn't been steady... Three guesses why ...", "From an outside perspective it is infact incrdibly weird for you as a single person to be going on vacation with a couple, regardless of how convenient it is for you I can't see why a married couple would want to bring a third party along with them, and this story gives the impression they were unicorn hunting and one of them got cold feet about it (the husband it seems).\n\nEdit: Forgot my verdict. OP you are NTA don't pay a single dime.", "Are you American? Maybe it's a cultural thing. To me (we live in Europe) it's not weird at all. There are at least two other heterosexual couples (friends with the female first, learned to appreciate the husbands) I would go on vacation with in a heartbeat. In fact, I HAVE gone on vacation with couples. NOTHING sexual about it, not in a million years. And after I told the story to neighbors of mine I'm close with (lesbian couple, a lot younger than me) they offered for me to come on a trip with them in September because they felt so bad for me. We will probably end up staying in different places and doing stuff together during the day, but even if we didn't, there's not a single weird vibe.", "You live to learn :). Because of the scheduling, it also meant I would have been there (at least) one night less than them. I was prepared to let that slide too.", "Nah I'm British. So whilst I'm in Europe aswell our culture is probably quite a fair bit more individual and similar to american culture than most of Europe. Here even if you're close enough to essentially be siblings (grown up as best friends or something similar) it's viewed as incredibly strange to be \"third-wheeling\" a couple's vacation and most people would assume something untoward if a couple invited them on a getaway.", "You are an AH to yourself, a real friend would not expect you to pay more than your share to subsidise them, especially when you won\u2019t even have your own bedroom. Your friend is treating you like their financer of their life.\n\ndo yourself a favour and find new friends. Learn to not treat yourself like a doormat and then other people will not expect to walk all over you.", "Ha, who would've thunk that Germans could be more emotionally flexible than British people? /s", "To be clear: I offered, she did not expect me to. She was very touched in the beginning and I would have been fine with it. I was just really pissed off that she kept talking about my lack of involvement and appreciation while completely ignoring what I consider a more than generous gesture.", "Why would you pay anything for a trip you are no longer invited on?\n\nShe doesn't want you there. Nope out and travel with friends who don't mess you about.\n\nNTA", "NTA Oh my God! Who raised you?! I ask because I don\u2019t understand why any grown adult would even consider paying for something that has been revoked. \n\nDo you usually go out of your way to placate others at the expense of your own comfort/finances etc?\n\nJane is an ass. Whatever her issue is - it\u2019s her problem. If she is unable to articulate herself, too bad. She doesn\u2019t get to treat people like this. \n\nNow, it\u2019s up to you whether you want to give her a chance to explain herself or withdraw from that \u2018friendship\u2019 entirely. But whatever you choose, remember that people will treat you the way you allow them to treat you (to an extent if you know what I mean).", "NTA, pay \u00a30.00 and walk away.", "NTA, obviously. Don't pay a dime. I don't know what the fuck is going on with Jane but I'm sorry she is treating you that way. That must be very painful.\n\nYou might benefit from examining how much people-pleasing you were doing all along/how determined you seemed to set yourself on fire so you could keep them warm. Do you not realize that you matter just as much as Jane and John? Your feelings and comfort are important too. You are important too.\n\nGoing along with the massively inconveniencing date change. Being happy to compromise by sleeping in the open gallery (I don't see where the compromise is by the way, that's just you sacrificing your comfort - that's one-sided). While still paying a third?! Offering to pay more than your share. Repeatedly. Feeling sorry for John to this day (it's his partner, how they split expenses on a trip you have been disinvited from isn't your problem + he himself doesn't seem too bothered by the money situation).", "Hell no", "NTA\n\nDon't give them any money.  IT's pretty clear that John didn't want you there which is why he never gave you the information to pay him  \n\nJane wasn't on board with him until just recently.  And now, she's doubled down on not having you be part of their lives any longer.\n\nFriendships end.  It's a breakup.   You will go through the grief process.  And it's okay.\n\nTake care of yourself and relax when you get back from that business trip.  A nice staycation with your doggo will help recharge your batteries.", "NTA\u2026.The wife clearly does want an female third wheel on her vacation.  Take the hint.", "Already on it :)", "That was my feeling too.", "I'm usually not very high maintenance. The timing stressed me out a lot, the sleeping arrangement didn't. I would have been mostly hidden from sight but there was no acoustic privacy. But you're right, I need to learn to better fight my corner.", "I hear you.", "Thanks!", "I was hurt and emotional, it was late, I was tired, and in theory, I knew better than to reply that night but still did. I couldn't believe I went from looking forward to a vacation to losing two friends in a day.  It was a stupid attempt not to be an ass in return. And since her wording was not a definite no, I hoped we could still turn things around. It was also a bit of a test, tbh, because any decent person would have rejected the offer (I know I would have!). But after she doubled down and then had the audacity to finally send me the account #, I was **PISSED**. Still figuring out the explaining/withdrawing part. And no, I'm not usually a doormat. My emotions were all over the place and got the worst of me.", "Thanks so much! Tapped out and tired now, but really appreciate it.", "She isn\u2019t your friend.", "I mean, I would have thought that the time spent together on the vacation would be the time for bonding...", "Are you sure this isn't her propositioning you on behalf of John? That way, they dont have to work up to it during the vacation? And can get straight into creating a beast with 3 backs? \n\nCause it sounds like she expected you to be a third in her relationship leading up to and on the vacation.\n\nAfter all, there was only one bedroom, and your sleeping arrangements sounds like there would have been zero privacy.", "Sometimes people change. Or it takes a while for them to show their true selves. \n\nBest thing in my opinion is to strengthen other relationships. She may come back later and say sorry, I had unreasonable expectations. Or not. No need to chop the tree down. Just feed it reciprocally and let it be whatever it is nsturally", "In my experience, therapist are usually very emotional people who are drawn to their profession because they have unresolved issues.  Until these issues are resolved, they are difficult/irrational people.   Sounds like your friend has definitely not worked through her issues.", "They are partners, no? Then he can deal with her as he sees fit. Just be clear communicating that she uninvited you so you won\u2019t be paying for a trip you\u2019re not attending. That\u2019s insane to otherwise", "Nope, nope, nope. I know this is Reddit, but absofuckinglutely nope.", "I thought the same for a moment.  So odd.  The whole thing.  Maybe that was their \u201cplan\u201d but then someone changed their mind. Idk just all weird.", "I did wonder this. It seems a bit extreme but their reaction is also very odd. Who needs togetherness before a vacation?", "Great advice, thanks.", "Spot on.", "Do married people not have friends?", "did not realise this was weird lol, me and my gf have asked friends to go along often times and had trips with friends. weve been together for nearly 9 years and only havent married yet because its expensive. next week were actually going away for a weekend trip with one friend... and we are absolutely not interested in unicorns, very monogamous relationship\n\nmaybe its a cultural thing? i know plenty of couples who go on holidays with friends, and if one of those friends is single sometimes they are the only one coming along", "So yes, got it.", "Valid question.", "Yes but generally not single friends who they'd be inviting on what would otherwise be seen as a romantic getaway.  Particularly so if they're parents, as alone time with their spouse tends to be at a premium.", "THANK YOU.", "My experience with \"generally\" is different. Kids are almost grown-up or out of the house, they have plenty alone time. And why should I not be friends with couples just because I'm currently single?", "NTA I'd be sending them a venmo request for the time you wasted trying to get them to communicate. Petty me. Then I'd send screen shots of all the contact I tried to make. Then I'd cut contact. One or both of them have an issue with you. Screw 'em.", "NTA for all the reasons everyone else has listed, but I *do* have to wonder about something (not that it affects the verdict any). Is it possible that John's thrown you under the bus here? If you've been trying to get the account info from him and he's been putting it off, is it possible that Jane got upset at him for not having you squared away yet and he offloaded the blame in your direction by saying you hadn't followed through? It's baffling enough behavior that I'm trying to rationalize what could even lead Jane to reach out like that in the first place, and that's the first thing I land on.", "YWNBTA.\n\nI do wonder why you think you should pay 20% more than they were paying. They moved the dates, they are taking the bedroom while you have no privacy, they should be paying 20% more than you.\n\nRegardless, send copies of requests for account no and asking how much to pay that you sent to John to his wife and say you won't go on holiday with people who are refusing to tell me how much to pay, give me a means to pay it while also getting angry at me for not paying.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if John decided he can't afford it, didn't book it and is putting off telling his wife or somehow they are trying to con you to pay some guilt money then going themselves without having someone tag along to their one bedroom vacation rental.", "NTA \nbut you need to seriously start respecting yourself more \nwhy would you pay a dime?", "NTA they are not your friends.", "NTA fuck em. They uninvited you from the vacation and still expected you to pay your share. Cut these assholes out of your life. You don't need all this unnecessary drama.", "NTA and DONT PAY THEM A DIME", "NTA and zero contribution OP.\n\nI would also seriously not have anything else to do with Jane.", "Or maybe their plan was a three way and she got cold feet and uninvited you.", "NTA. It's ideal to never go back on your word, but sometimes you have to if you are being manipulated or taken advantage of. Just say, \"I hadn't thought it through when I said that, but now I realize it's not reasonable for me to pay anything when I've been uninvited. I'm sure you would feel the same if the situation were reversed. \" Period. Full Stop. :)", "When people are this much work, they aren't worth it. Just spend that money on something nice for yourself.", "Given that he turned down you paying several times and rented a place without space for you, are you sure that he ever really wanted you to be involved in his vacation in the first place?", "American here who has been on vacations with couples many times. All very ordinary. And the couple frequently assumes the single person will be just fine with not having a real room, lol.", "I live in South America and to me also sounds completely normal for you to go together with friends who are a couple. Nothing weird or sexual about it. \n \nTo me is weird people thinking that is weird lol.\n\nAlso NTA, op. Don't pay a dime, she was very rude to you. She decided to end the friendship when she wrote what she wrote, so don't make yourself feel like the responsible for salvage this relationship", "no worries lol, i hope you get to enjoy a holiday with better friends in the future ^^", "Sorry I think you've misunderstood me. I was responding to the previous person as I thought they were asking about what the cultural norms are in England. It's not at all strange for couples to have friends, it's considered generally quite strange here(in the UK) to go on holiday with your spouse and a single friend. My fault for not clarifying.", "WTF?! NTA\n\nI don't know what's wrong with Jane but she's pissing in the whiskey.\n\nCan you send her screenshots of asking for John's account number earlier?\n\nI'd ask  why you would pay for a vacation you've been disinvited to.", "NTA- Zero.  When someone does not respond to you, what are you supposed to do?", "NTA. If it were me I would send screenshots and/or detailed listing of every time you asked about payment when you tell them no (OP, *please* tell them no). I agree with others saying the real reason for Jane picking a fight probably hasn\u2019t surfaced yet but also want to add that since you seem to be partially excusing him in comments that John is not your friend while he enables this fight. Staying out of an argument that he is the cause of and *knowing* his partner is wrongly blaming you for those things is **him taking her side.** He is not a neutral party and you shouldn\u2019t treat him as such. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re in a relationship/he\u2019s loyal to his spouse/whatever it might be\u2014you\u2019re not obligated to deal with the fallout of poor communication between them.", "I think they deserve your two cents' worth. That's 2\u00a2 because I know how to make \u00a2 on my kybrd.\n\nThis sounds so tedious I want to *scream*.\n\nUnless I completely misunderstood the question, you are NTA and WNBTA if you sent nothing. \n\nDo you have the message exchanges where you kept asking to pay, and all other messages? Screen shot and/or print 'em out 'cause she's gonna keep shaking your tree ...", "NTA. They changed the date and made things increasingly harder for you. On top of that, communication goes both ways. Do not pay for a vacation you are not going on. Especially for someone who is contributing nothing.", "NTA  Zero would be as much as Jane would ever get from me.", "NTA. You have some seriously AH friends. Definitely \u00a30 contribution if you ask me!", "NTA", "NTA. Why would you offer to pay after the crazy lady uninvited you? Tell them to have a nice vacation, then block them. Something else is going on and it sounds toxic.", "NTA 100% and don\u2019t give them a cent.", "We have a phrase here. Let me give ya my two cents worth.\n\nIf you have his account info send .02.", "Let's say you and 2 other people are putting money together to go on an expensive trip.  If you don't want one of the people to come, one of the first things that will run through your head is, \"do I really not want to be around this person enough to cover their part of this expensive trip?\"\n\nAlso, if you uninvited someone to an event, then would you ever ask them for cash to go?", "It sound like she wanted to set up a threesome, then got increasingly agitated when you maintained platonic boundaries.\n\nEspecially if she was only sort-of willing (maybe John pushed for it) and started getting cold feet.\n\nNTA either way. You did nothing wrong.", "**said I would pay about 20 percent more than my share** \n\nWhy were you offering to pay 20% more than your share?", "I would transfer them a dollar. A single dollar.", "They are not your friends. Get a hold of yourself and stop treating yourself like a loser", "I wonder how much her partner lied to her about the pre-vacation comms with you. Does she know how many times you asked for bank info so you could transfer funds, for example. \n\nIt also sounds a bit like she or possibly they both changed their minds about having you along; the one bedroom space is a huge clue, but rather than own up to that, better the create a narrative where \\*you\\* are at fault.\n\nDrop them both. Something's up.", "I get that. Jane is a colossal ass. I wouldn\u2019t bother contacting her or John again. If she wants to reach out, maybe you can consider responding (depending on what she has to say). If she doesn\u2019t reach out\u2026well, you have your answer.", "Does she mean a threesome? It sounded odd AF. Isn\u2019t the holiday the togetherness", "> She's playing you or she's a very unwell person. \n\nI also think this.", "But it seems like John tossed you under the bus...", "I would also say it is unfair to you to pay more than your share and be stuck sleeping in the common area with no privacy. Especially with the cost being higher than expected. Basically the original travel plans no longer exist so don't feel any guilt about backing out.", "Get a hold of yourself and stop treating yourself like a loser.", "Also, OP repeatedly asked John for the bank transfer information, who kept putting it off. Had he not done that, the entire situation would have been avoided.", "This question deserves more attention.", "I'm American and everyone is being sex-weird because they're f'ing morons and probably men. Ignore them, it's not weird to go on vacation with friends.", "They totally wanted to have a 3some. Sorry. There's really no other reason she would have gotten so emotional; she was having second thoughts about it, and finally uninvited you and blamed it all on you."]}
