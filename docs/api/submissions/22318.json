Jane has been a really close friend for a long time. I also get along really well with her partner (John), so no-brainer. We found a beautiful but somewhat pricey vacation home. Driving time is 10+ hours. I went along with it despite a couple of HUGE inconveniences for me: \r  \n\n\n* They moved the original June date to July/August. I have a week-long business trip (4+ hours of driving in the opposite direction) until the evening before. There was no way for me to get to the house the day of.\n* This means having to travel separately, me coming home exhausted Friday night, packing my stuff, picking up my dog etc. before getting in the car again sometime Saturday night. \r\n* On top, I would have to be on call the entire time to sub for a colleague who is also on vacation.  \r  \nLater we also realized that the house only has one real bedroom and that I would have to sleep on the open gallery. Again, happy to compromise.\n\n\rI immediately offered to pay my share when John paid the deposit. He shrugged it off. John and I are both financially stable, with him earning more than me. Jane switched career paths a couple of years ago but struggles to build a consistent client base. I know that John subsidized past vacations, and I also offered to pay more than my share. \n\n\rI repeatedly raised the question of how to split the cost and asked for his account number to at least wire him my \u201cofficial\u201d share. I was always met with \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out later\u201d. Mid-June Jane requested we meet because she felt there was not enough \u201ctogetherness\u201d leading up to the vacation. This was directed to both John and I. We talked it out and all seemed well. I brought up the money issue again. Shortly after, I left for another 10-day trip, and the invoice for the final payment came. There was some communication around it, but the ball was in John\u2019s court. Things were hectic after I got home (11 days before payment was due, 3 weeks until vacation) so I only got back to them a week later and said I would pay about 20 percent more than my share (still no account #). I would have also been fine with paying the remaining sum and sorting things out later. \n\n  \nCue the drama. Jane replies by calling my behavior not ok - getting back too late, not trying to sort things out, not asking for his account # etc., also saying again I was not committed enough (WTF?). The email ended with: \u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t feel like going on vacation with you.\u201d \r  \nNot wanting to be TA and trying to still rescue the friendship, I replied that despite her being wrong I would still pay my part (stupid, I know). Not able to admit fault, Jane then said the money was not the central issue and doubled down on the \u201ctoo little active involvement\u201d aspect (while she herself never made any effort either), putting a definite stop to our vacation. She also sent me John\u2019s account number \u201cto contribute however much I see fit\u201d. I\u2019m now thinking zero.

I was emotional, hoping we would still find a solution (losing her as a friend hurts like hell) and getting carried away with occupying the moral high ground ... Many more details to this story are unfortunately lost due to character limit.", "Thanks, that is my feeling exactly. I feel we haven't gotten to the real reason yet. But I'm also not sure if she knows the real reason and is not telling me or if there is something she is not aware of and just projecting.", "I also have no idea if she was just speaking for herself or them both, but my gut feeling is that it is just her. I think John is just staying out of it to not be caught in the middle as he seemed to have no problem with the whole money thing. I also don't get why she is kicking up such a fuss when it was clear that John and I would both pay more than her.", "I thought it was a unicorn poaching trip with OP as the prey.", "Thanks.", "Haha! Glad it happened now and not someplace 1,000 km away.", "True.", "NTA - no trip, no pay.     \n     \nNot everyone here is OPs friend.", "I'm not sure I understand what you mean.", "Because apparently I am an idiot sometimes. I was emotional and felt it was the right thing to do (moral high ground and such). Could have kicked my ass the next day. But the fact that she didn't say \"Of course I don't expect you to pay anything\" was the most valuable lesson in all this. That's when I was truly done even though I hate going back on my word.", "Tbh, I don't think John has problems paying for the house by himself. I know that he did so in the past when they were traveling with their kids (patchwork family, both have 2). With me joining them, it would have been a less expensive vacation than before, without me it might add to the same amount he's used to paying. Plus they won't have to pay for food for 6 people. So all in all this might end up being less expensive than past vacations.", "Yeah, I'm also thinking we haven't yet gotten to the root of it. John is very straightforward and I'm pretty sure he would have told me if he was bothered. It was also really weird that she never picked up the phone or sent me a text. Instead it was rather formal-sounding emails all the way.", "Despite being a close friend, there is a history of putting responsibility on me when things don't go the way she thinks they should. Haven't talked for a while? Always my mistake. I recently pointed out to her that I called her and it took her 5 days to get back to me. Surprised Pikachu face. She has called me out for similar behavior (taking one or two days to reply to a text) numerous times. I think there is a real possibility it just didn't register with her that I raised the issue several times. I know that fighting about money can blow up vacations and friendships, that's why I made a conscious effort to mention it. My gut feeling is that John does not have an issue with this whole thing or me. I think he would have contacted me if he was really upset. Actually, I sent him a message at the beginning of June telling him to please give me his account number. He then told me that Jane wanted to meet (to discuss the whole appreciation/commitment thing which I didn't know about at that point) and that we would sort it out after. He had 4 months to give me his account number and never did, so I'm guessing he wasn't really bothered.", "That was my first thought.", "Some people enjoy the act of fighting. They\u2019re good at it. They like upsetting people and getting sympathy. My ex would try or organize situations where she could pick a fight and I\u2019d see them coming and do what I could to derail her plan, in the sense of peacekeeping. \n\nNow I ignore it and let her be upset.", "Text them both. Reiterate the situation and then tell them because Jane uninvited you, you will not be paying. Then let them have whatever argument they seem to be having between themselves.", "That's what I thought lol. Idk why a couple is inviting 1 single person with them on vacation. \n\nOp don't go and don't pay anything. Just make it clear it was a miscommunication and that they should enjoy their vacation", "Haha! Sorry, gotta go and poop some rainbows.", "Sometimes ya gotta keep the argument simple", "They\u2019re asking why you volunteered to pay for a trip you\u2019re not going on.", "Yeah, just talk it out. Be very frank about your point of view and why you're confused or hurt about what she's telling you. Ask her to explain her point of view very clearly because you're not seeing the situation through the same lens as she is. I'm sure I don't have to say this, but don't be accusatory or angry when you bring it up, just honest. I'd also suggest face to face if you have time.\n\nHope you work it out :)", "This reminds me of a former friend who\u2019s call ME out for the same behaviour they\u2019d exhibit themselves. \n\nJust as you did, I would point out specific occasions where they did the very thing they accused me and\u2026 silence. Her partner was also the easygoing quiet type.\n\nSaid friend dumped me over some false accusations.  It was hurtful in the beginning but  I realise I\u2019m better off, since I remembered all the BS I tolerated in the name of friendship", "She's not shown behavior like that before and I'm completely dumbfounded. She's also a therapist ... so at least in theory, she should know better.", "Thanks, I might do that. I feel a bit sorry for John though as he will now be carrying most of the financial burden.", "We were close. I know and really like their kids (both have 2 from previous relationships) and it felt a bit like family. Nothing weird about it, I was touched they asked me. I'm single and often travel alone. They also have a dog, so it seemed like a perfect match. Sharing the cost also would have allowed me to stay in a vacation home I wouldn't/couldn't pay for by myself.", "Thanks :). Because we booked the house together, and I hate going back on my word. Her wording did not sound final at that point (\"My gut feeling right now is ...\") and I did not want to burn all bridges. Also because I'm stupid :). Her definitely calling it off two days later made things clearer.", "Thanks <3. At this point, however, I'm not sure if I even want to anymore. I told her that I need time to think about everything. I have to find out how much this friendship is worth to me, emotionally and financially. Not paying anything means burning all bridges, I guess that's why I'm hesitant. I was very frank about my point of view and my emotions, and she said she was sorry I felt pain (but took no responsibility for causing it). I guess I'm still mostly flabbergasted about this whole drama.", "Sounds eerily similar. Sorry this happened to you and thanks for sharing!", "I\u2019d fade her out.", "Sure but that's their problem to deal with. They uninvited you so that means they have to pay all the costs. If john is unhappy about that he needs to deal with Jane.", "You didn\u2019t go back on your word, she uninvited you. She literally wants you now to subsidize their beach house because reasons???? \n\nAlso, you never should have offered to pay more than your share. Frankly since you weren\u2019t getting a bedroom, you should have paid less. They were taking advantage of you from the get go.", "> I have to find out how much this friendship is worth to me, emotionally and financially. \n\nFair enough. Sorry about the situation.", "Good point."]}
