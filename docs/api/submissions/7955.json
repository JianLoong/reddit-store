But your an asshole for saying that she's being rude by covering her nose? Why do you really care how she reacts to it? That's her choice? So, not only do you want her to let you cook the eggs and eat the tuna, you want her to *agree* with you that it's not disgusting and you want her to quietly suffer the smell, so you don't get offended about your food choices?

I've found that the majority of the foods that I retried, I ended up liking, not necessarily because my tastebuds changed but more because I just had better cooked versions of those foods.\n\nThere were some things that my family did right but there were a lot of things that they didn't.

Trying reading further down.", "Perhaps you should consider the simple fact that even neurotypical people can identify the smell of many compounds which contain sulphur even in low quantities?\n\nIt's in the chemical that makes our eyes water when cutting onions. It's in the compound that makes garlic pungent, and who hasn't considered how that affects our breath after a date? Maybe you've heard about mercaptan/methanethiol the compound added to your natural gas that helps you to recognize if there's a leak? Or maybe hydrogen sulphide, that's what gives swamps, bogs, sewers and very often farts that unpleasant rotten egg aroma?\n\nThe human body is literally designed to pick up on those types of substances, in miniscule amounts, and cause reactions to them. Since that's a very simple biological fact, it stands to reason that if the OP can help to reduce the amount of those compounds they're producing when cooking their hard-boiled eggs, their child's senses might not be as adversely affected.\n\nSo again, while I'm sure you feel that you know what you are on about, I'm afraid that I'm going to focus on what may very well be the source of the problem that the young lady is experiencing.

Just ask her to not make a big deal about it. She can plug her nose, but can't make comments or tell you want to eat or not. \n\nI think you can both meet each other halfway. Yes she's on the spectrum, and yes that means she's sensitive to sensory input. But that doesn't mean she can expect all smells to go away. Knowing she has ASD means you know that she needs extra guidance in dealing with smells. Some research or professional advice may help there. \n\nI also completely agree with what the others are saying about cooking time. If they smell, you're cooking them for too long, and you get the sulphur smell. Try reducing the cook time, trust in 'carry-over cooking,' and maybe see if there are other tips to reduce the smell.\n\nWith tuna, if you really like it, or you like the nutritional benefits, maybe warn her when you're about to make tuna, so she can avoid the kitchen. Depending on how sensitive she is to it, think about what can be done to make or neutralize the odor. Are some type of tuna smellier than others? \n\nSome smells can be helped, some can't.

Anyway he decided he wanted an egg salad sandwich for lunch and he asked me to watch his eggs boiling. I told him I couldn't, he got upset, we got into an argument about it. I warned him multiple times that I am not watching his eggs. He didn't believe me. So I went about with my day. About 40 minutes later, I'm upstairs and my brother is in the living room and we hear a big BANG. Both run towards the noise to see what happened.......... the stench was OVERWHELMING.

The smell gets everywhere its harder to escape in the house. I can lock myself in my room if the door was already closed, but, if it was open... Fuck. And then I CAN'T leave it. And the smell LINGERS.\n\nI once tried to get better at dealing with it, and it turned into me not being able to live with Italian dressing anymore, cause my brother mixed Italian dressing with tuna. I know associate the two. I can't be around the salad dressing.\n\nOnce I know a bowl was used to eat tuna, the sink and the sponge and the dishwasher and all the other dishes have been CONTAMINATED. I have trouble touching them. I have trouble using them. It's a consuming thought that I have to fight through. Depending on how well I'm doing mentally, the success of me fighting this varies. \n\nKnowing all this about me my family refuses to stop eating tuna. It causes me harm, but they won't stop.

You know your daughter has ASD, and yet you seem to take the least empathetic reaction to this, assuming that it's her acting offensive and rude. It seems much more reasonable to me that she simply doesn't want to smell eggs.\n\nAnd for the record, overpowering smells give me a headache, sometimes even a full blown migraine.

This is the way we were taught in Culinary school.\n\nPut them in cold water, bring to boil, as soon as it boils turn off the heat and let sit for 10 mins with the lid on.   Then ideally shock them in an ice bath.", "I am so sorry for your family treating you like that, for being trapped because of the medical problems, *and* for the medical problems.", "Also probably has to do with the freshness of the eggs. One of our kids won't touch eggs in any form, but if it's part of a recipe, like baking, he's ok with that. He sorta cringes watching people eat eggs.", "I know hard boiled is 5-5-5:\n\n5 minutes pressure cook, \n5 minutes natural release, \n5 minutes soaked in cold water. \n\nI'm guessing for medium it must be the same rules but for 3 minutes each.", "Im autistic and nothing rude about plugging your nose, thats saying its rude for someone to use a walker when they have mobility issues", "I'm the exact opposite. Growing up we rarely had cooked vegetables, but every dinner started with a salad. It was iceberg lettuce with tomato wedges and sometimes cucumber. We also got raw carrots and celery stuffed with cream cheese as snacks. But nothing else.\n\nFortunately, it was the 70s, so salad bars were very popular. I quickly learned to love raw broccoli, bell peppers, pea pods, \"exotic\" greens like spinach and romaine, and a host of other things.\n\nBut never cooked vegetables. \n\nAnd for the most part, I hate them. The best I will do is eat them if they are so lightly steamed so that they are warmed through but still crunchy. The exception is spinach, which I sometimes cook in butter and garlic, and Brussel sprouts, oddly, because I had them roasted once, and learned they were delicious.\n\nEverything else I much prefer raw.", "Don't have kids please", "Many vegetables are good roasted, carrots, Brussels sprouts , beets, cauliflower", "I absolutely love brussel sprouts and omg in a vinagrette they are soo good.", "Like I said in another reply, we have one kid who hates eggs. The only way he'll eat them is if they are part of a recipe, like cakes or cookies. Egg salad, scrambled or any forms that is identifiable is a no. Even french toast is a no.", "God you're bringing me back to the time an older relative was boiling some eggs on the stove on a low fire, but forgot. I'd taken them to run an errand and by the time we got back everything was filled with smoke.\n\nGot a whiff of it walking to the door. Opened the door and got it full blast. Raced to the stove and grabbed the pot, tossed it out into the yard. Apart from a lot of soot by the stove, and the stench, everything was fine. But that stench, it was horrible. And. It. Stuck. Around. For. So. Long.\n\n\ud83d\ude2d", "Not cauliflower, that has to be raw for me. I'll eat it, but don't care for it. Broccoli has to be cooked, don't like it raw.

Get over yourself", "YTA, full stop.\n\nI have an ASD child, and I have allergies to certain foods and their odors, so I can respect how my child feels about foods/textures/odors.\n\nMy family and friends know these things, and adjust their meals accordingly for when I/we visit. \n\nIt's a basic human courtesy. Cook/consume these foods when your child isn't home and air the place out afterwards. It's NOT difficult.", "YTA but only for saying she\u2019s \u201crude\u201d for plugging her nose.

YTA", "# YTA.\n\nI have ASD, and also have an oversensitive sense of smell among other things. Cooking eggs is fine, what makes YTA is calling her offensive for simply blocking her nose. She's doing what she can to cope with being around those smells. She could be doing much worse but that seems like the least disruptive way to cope other than asking you not to cook those foods, which she's already done.", "You know your daughter hates the smell, yet you were offended that she plugged her nose!   That is awful!", "YTA, low fat LOL.  \nIf your daughter came in the room and ripped a huge terrible fart and said that it was just most convenient for her would you be upset?", "YTA, gently. There are ways to solve this. #1 TRUST and BELIEVE that this really does affect her. If her sensory processing is wacky enough, little things like this can pile on during the day and contribute to sensory overload/meltdowns. At 19 she'll likely be living elsewhere soon enough and you could spend all day eating durian if you wanted. #2 There are pre-made boiled eggs. Just get those. #3 Run fans, open a window, use an air freshener that doesn't trigger her symptoms (I lived with 3 autistic people and citrus seemed to be the thing that everyone could tolerate), or cook the strong-smelling foods when she's away. #4 Yeah this is annoying but this is your child with a disability. If you had nausea when you were pregnant, you might remember how intolerable certain smells were. Yes there's a big world out there where she'll  need to suck it up and deal with smells and sounds that are overwhelming, which is why home should be a sensory sanctuary. If she had epilepsy you wouldn't have disco lights flashing, right? \n\nJust make the accommodations to air out the place and keep making your food in a respectful way. It's a compromise. I say this as a person with GI issues who has to live mostly on smoothies--my youngest (17) knows they need to duck out of the room when I need to run the blender, but I also won't run the blender if they're in the middle of something in the kitchen. This is family. We compromise.", "If the eggs smells you might be over cooking it btw", "All she did was plug her nose, and you got offended? YTA.    You already knew she didn\u2019t like the smell.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should have to stop eating tuna and hard boiled eggs, but you should understand if she doesn\u2019t want to smell them, ASD or not.", "YTA\n\nYou know that she is sensitive to the smell of such, yet you find her plugging her nose rude why?  \n\nSo are you saying that you do not find any odors offensive and would not plug your nose?  \n\nOr would you have preferred her to make comments and digs about what you are cooking?", "YTA due to your reaction to her plugging her nose.  I keep reading these comments about a sulphur smell from hard boiled eggs.   Is it possible for this many people to not know how to cook them correctly?  It\u2019s one of the simplest things in the world and if cooked correctly they are basically odorless until taken out of the shell.  Weird.", "Instapot.  6 min, natural release for about 5, then full release.  Ice bath or cold water.  The shells peel right off.  The yolk is yellow and soft and has very little smell.  I don't think you should stop eating what you like but if there is a way to prepare the food when she is gone or give her a heads-up before you do it?  I think NAH is my take.", "Put cold eggs in cold water. Gently raise the temperature to just simmering. Take the eggs off the heat, cover and time for 12 minutes. Perfect hardboiled eggs. No smell.", "Yep, I learned in college when I over-microwaved one :(", "Not liking a smell is NOT the same as having sensory issues/ASD. The daughter was plugging her nose because smells can be so overwhelming for autistic people that they can cause an overwhelming sensation similar to physical pain, and intense feelings of distress and even rage. This is not his daughter\u2019s fault. It\u2019s a neurodevelopment disability.", "I love a warm egg with buttered toast, eggs that have been refrigerated don\u2019t have nearly the same level of delicious.", "This. Why not just boil the eggs when the daughter is out?\n\nI love eggs, but am nauseated by the smell of seafood. My ex used to cook it for himself anyway, complaining loudly about not being able to have it as often as he would have liked, and left the dishes and pans for me to clean. The pan smelled just as bad when I was cleaning it as it had when he was cooking in it. Now I live joyfully alone and never have to smell seafood in my home.", "I'm going to have to look into that. I love hard-boiled eggs and know how to make them correctly but you have to time it perfectly and I am far from a perfectionist.", "Absolutely obsessed with my Dash egg cooker. I use it everyday!!", "I love that thing. It's also safer than boiling them.", "I'm not saying it's something she can control. I'm saying that it doesn't mean she can tell other people what to eat.", "Even if she works in a warehouse or store or restaurant or some other type of building people are still going to eat whatever they want for lunch in the lunchroom/break room", "I am relieved to know that I, in fact, cook my hard boiled eggs properly. I have never had bad smelling or gray eggs. I wouldn't eat them if they were. Mine are always yellow.", "Not just hard boiled - I think I\u2019m the only person in my house that doesn\u2019t overcook their eggs in the frying pan.  More than once per week I have to get out of bed to tell them their eggs are done because I can smell overcooked eggs when they apparently cannot.", "Similar to why I used to have some vegetables like broccoli and carrots - when I was growing up my mom cooked them until they were mush.", "Extra calcium!!", "I have to laugh because my mother used to use a pressure cooker to cook veggies.  To the point where they were pretty much mush. I love veggies now because I know how to cook them properly.", "Thanks!", "Pickled jalape\u00f1os are soooo good in egg salad!", "I met a woman once (a friend of a friend at a party) whose autistic son would only eat pie. His grandmother gave him a bite of her apple pie once when he was a toddler and he ended up eating the entire slice. Before that he would only eat about three things, so his parents were thrilled that he'd added a new one and that he was actually consuming fruit. Then they tried other fruit pies and he ate them all. One day they tried a chicken pot pie, and he ate it! They were amazed! It turned out he would eat almost anything in a pie crust. It had to have both a bottom and top crust though, he wouldn't eat a quiche or something without a \"blanket\" as he called it. He speaks very few words but \"blanket\" is his favorite. He loves things to be...covered, I think was what his mom said. \n\nAnyway, they've found that he'll eat a wide, healthy variety of things (not everything, but close enough) as long as they put it in a pie crust and it has a \"blanket\" top crust."]}
