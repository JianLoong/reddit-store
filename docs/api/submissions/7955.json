But your an asshole for saying that she's being rude by covering her nose? Why do you really care how she reacts to it? That's her choice? So, not only do you want her to let you cook the eggs and eat the tuna, you want her to *agree* with you that it's not disgusting and you want her to quietly suffer the smell, so you don't get offended about your food choices?

I used to get yelled at for swatting smoke away from my face or covering my nose when my family would smoke in the car. They thought I was so rude, when i was literally getting sick from the smell. I wasn't even vocalizing it, but my trying to keep myself safe was viewed as offensive and rude and let me tell you, making a person with ASD (or any condition) be physically uncomfortable just to save your ego is the worst thing you can possibly due.

She literally *did* block her nose, and she was called rude and disrespectful for it. So apparently, she's not allowed to use coping strategies either. The only reasonable solution, as far as OP is concerned, is for her daughter to basically stop having sensory issues - which isn't going to happen.", "I've made it a point over the years to try pretty much everything at least once and to retry foods that I haven't had in a long time because I didn't like them. I've found that the majority of the foods that I retried, I ended up liking, not necessarily because my tastebuds changed but more because I just had better cooked versions of those foods.\n\nThere were some things that my family did right but there were a lot of things that they didn't. I had a very difficult relationship with the majority of vegetables for a large portion of my life as a result. I'm still not big on most raw veggies, but when cooked well, I really enjoy them.", "Well, after 5 decades of egg boiling, other than reddit, I know noone in real life who makes any fuss about the grey/sulphur element of egg boiling and actually think this derails the op's thread. Which I replied to fully away from this sulphur derailment, further down.", "My mom would think you\u2019re rude if you covered your ears. I think it\u2019s just as valid as the OPs daughter covering her nose. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve bought into the idea that you\u2019re not allowed to accommodate your sensory needs and that you then project that onto others. \n\nPeople take our sensory accommodations personally all the time and it\u2019s not ok. \n\nYour misophone and OPs daughters smell sensitivity are both real and valid and allowed to be blocked.", "I was meaning that is an effective strategy- and thus one that should be embraced, rather than ridiculed and then never cooking eggs again- cos that\u2019s a no win for anyone", "That sounds like a great attitude, and I can sympathise about the veggies \ud83d\ude05", "Congratulations? Seeing as how the OP's thread is literally about someone who clearly has a problem with the smell of her hard-boiled eggs, I figure your not knowing anyone who makes a fuss about it isn't particularly relevant. \ud83e\udd37", "I accommodate my sensory needs.. but I do it my self because only I am responsible for them.. and I CAN manage them myself.. so its not fair to put them on others... who have their own triggers and own issurs.. if everbody who can cares about themself It would be much easier for me because I would not ALSO in addition to my own needs have to walk on eggshells for everybody else... also it IS f.. rude to cover my ears just because my husband is chewing! he did nothing wrong.. he does not deserve to feel bad for eating!", "Raw veggies are just awful Fr. Gotta be cooked.", "Well, given I live with a child with autism with sensory needs, including olfactory, I'd say I'm well versed.\n\nBut noone gives a shit that the egg smell potentially comes from sulphur.\n\nWhat's important is managing the sensory needs of the child!\n\nAnd guess what instead of going on about sulphur, my post advises on managing these sensory needs! Trying reading further down.", "Perhaps you should consider the simple fact that even neurotypical people can identify the smell of many compounds which contain sulphur even in low quantities?\n\nIt's in the chemical that makes our eyes water when cutting onions. It's in the compound that makes garlic pungent, and who hasn't considered how that affects our breath after a date? Maybe you've heard about mercaptan/methanethiol the compound added to your natural gas that helps you to recognize if there's a leak? Or maybe hydrogen sulphide, that's what gives swamps, bogs, sewers and very often farts that unpleasant rotten egg aroma?\n\nThe human body is literally designed to pick up on those types of substances, in miniscule amounts, and cause reactions to them. Since that's a very simple biological fact, it stands to reason that if the OP can help to reduce the amount of those compounds they're producing when cooking their hard-boiled eggs, their child's senses might not be as adversely affected.\n\nSo again, while I'm sure you feel that you know what you are on about, I'm afraid that I'm going to focus on what may very well be the source of the problem that the young lady is experiencing. That is, a parent who probably doesn't know anywhere near as much about why cooking eggs can be offensive to the senses, as she thinks.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Now that I think about it, maybe it's catching?", "If you have a child with autism, most parents spend every bloody day mitigating over sensitivities! You genuinely have no idea how this manifests and literally affects EVERYTHING! \n\nKnowing the chemical reasoning does f all for these parents. They don't need a chemistry degree to parent!\n\nAs I said, multiple times, mitigation for these needs to be the focus.\n\nBluntly, she's going to continue boiling eggs, but can mitigate the impact, following advise given. Be that white vinegar, ventilation, doing so when out of the home and not storing in the fridge!"]}
