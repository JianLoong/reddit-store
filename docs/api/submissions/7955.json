But your an asshole for saying that she's being rude by covering her nose? Why do you really care how she reacts to it? That's her choice? So, not only do you want her to let you cook the eggs and eat the tuna, you want her to *agree* with you that it's not disgusting and you want her to quietly suffer the smell, so you don't get offended about your food choices?

I used to get yelled at for swatting smoke away from my face or covering my nose when my family would smoke in the car. They thought I was so rude, when i was literally getting sick from the smell. I wasn't even vocalizing it, but my trying to keep myself safe was viewed as offensive and rude and let me tell you, making a person with ASD (or any condition) be physically uncomfortable just to save your ego is the worst thing you can possibly due.

What a ridiculous thing to say. You don\u2019t know what their lives are like or what they have accomplished outside your judgmental gaze.", "It\u2019s not a newsflash to me. And it\u2019s also not a newsflash how difficult being a full time caregiver is. I think maybe despite your own preconceptions it\u2019s unfair to act like caregivers are not also entitled to their own simple choices. This young woman isn\u2019t being tortured even though her perception is probably exactly that. Her mother is a human being, not a robot that can be formatted to personal preferences.", "I've never heard of that! Just looked it up & I'm buying 1 for each of our kitchens. Brilliant, thanks for sharing!\n\nOur college kid lives in an apartment that she built downstairs, so 2 kitchens. Small dash for hers & large Dash for mine.", "This doesn\u2019t really help. Autistic people need to make some concessions, too.", "she might be intolerant or have a slight allergy. Please be kind to her.", "No but we can use all our strategies to manage so we don\u2019t adversely impact other people\u2019s standard enjoyment of life-\nLike blocking one\u2019s nose, leaving the kitchen, turning on the exhaust fan, going for a walk, engaging in sensory activities that are soothing, asking mum to make a cooking schedule so one knows what time to avoid etc etc etc etc", "I\u2019m usually the last person to use ASD as an excuse but it, plus financial reasons plus her age are all pretty compelling factors for her staying at home a bit longer.", "You said you don\u2019t think it would be good if she went out into the world thinking she can control what others eat. I hate to break it to you but we are on the same page with that comment!", "All the Dash gadgets are pretty great, tbh. I have the 3 pack of the wafflemaker/griddle/grill and it's pretty great as a gift for a college student!", "The concession would be staying out of the kitchen when warned about the eggs", "Spoken like a true privileged ableist. **Autistic people do nothing but make concessions, all damn day long.** You don't have the \"right\" facial expression. I don't like your tone. You said something that made people feel funny. It. Never. Ends.\n\nThe one place this girl should not need to put on an act is in her own home. And Autistic sensory issues aren't just \"preferences\". It's more like you have an allergy and someone insists that you eat that thing.\n\nAnd try to talk to other #actuallyAutistic adults just for your own edification.", "She did block her nose, and OP said 'I took this as offensive and rude.\". So she's not allowing her daughter to use any coping strategies. Op is YTA for that.", "Have you ever lived with a pregnant woman? I really want to know how that conversation goes with a pregnant woman in the throes of their hypersensitivity to smells.", "We said different things. I do not wish to associate myself with the words you posted at all.", "Yeah, but the poster\u2019s tone puts the emphasis on the mother, not the daughter. For the record I believe both mother and daughter need to make concessions, as indicated elsewhere in the thread.", "You know nothing about me!", "I\u2019ve been one? There is also a \u201ccure\u201d to hyperemesis of pregnancy (which is where the smell issue stems from) whereas autism is something that is permanent- therefore can either adapt and engage or be limited forever. I\u2019m not dismissing the difficulties that arose with hypersensitivity- but there are things which can be tried", "Maybe don\u2019t post on a public forum, then?", "Your behavior is incredibly strange. You can say you agree with me but your comment was very rude and I don\u2019t appreciate you hijacking my words and saying outlandish things as if I have to concede anything to you.", "So it looks like the answer to the question is \"no i haven't\"?  Because let me tell you, sometimes it gets a bit bonkers. But most people generally have enough compassion to try and adjust to minimize the impact that smells can have on the people that they care about.\n\nAnd if you read the original post, the daughter DID try to cope with the smell, by blocking her nose. The OP called the attempt to cope, rude and disrespectful. Imagine how you would have felt if during your hypersensitive times, the people living with you, called you \"rude and disrespectful\" for simply trying to cope in your own home? \n\nAnd that's before we even get to the fact that the OP may very well be overcooking the eggs, causing them to be way more smelly than they need to be in the first place. \ud83e\udd37"]}
