But your an asshole for saying that she's being rude by covering her nose? Why do you really care how she reacts to it? That's her choice? So, not only do you want her to let you cook the eggs and eat the tuna, you want her to *agree* with you that it's not disgusting and you want her to quietly suffer the smell, so you don't get offended about your food choices?

I used to get yelled at for swatting smoke away from my face or covering my nose when my family would smoke in the car. They thought I was so rude, when i was literally getting sick from the smell. I wasn't even vocalizing it, but my trying to keep myself safe was viewed as offensive and rude and let me tell you, making a person with ASD (or any condition) be physically uncomfortable just to save your ego is the worst thing you can possibly due.
