This is our 1st (& last--one & done!) pregnancy. Due to this being my 1st pregnancy & it's multiples, it's really tough. My morning sickness is insane, BP always high,  diabetes & anemia are back, lower back is in hell, there's an elephant on my pelvis & a whole lot of other shit.\n\nJ has been my rock (even though this is his fault) & spoils & treats me like a queen. He never says no & gives me stuff w/o asking. If it was up to him I'd be in bed all day & w/ 1000 servants.\n\nThe other week, I invited A & other friends over for a tea-tasting session b/c my aunt sent some from home. A asked if she could bring her friend K & I said OK. I've met K & M a few times before. They're nice people, K's real sweet & M gives aloof but with K, she just brings out a warmth in him. They have a 7 month baby.\n\nThe girls came over for tea & I'm doing everything b/c I'm the host & I want to feel not useless. They  offer help but I decline & ban them from the kitchen. I've been running back forth since before they came & eventually, it started to catch up with me. I'm running w/ a tray of treats & J comes home & sees me huffing & puffing & drops everything to check on me & help.\n\nHe's frantic & too worried, ushers me to the special chair in our living room & adjusts it. Doesn't even address my guests & they're staring & giggling & it's slightly embarrassing. He runs & grabs all the things that make me comfortable & sets it near me. I try to stop him but he has none of it. The girls are teasing me & telling me lucky & I'm hoping he relaxes.\n\nHe eventually continues what I was doing & is now the one bringing treats & refilling teas. I try to help again but he keeps telling me to relax & that I shouldn't have to lift a finger. I, a little frustrated & stubborn, still try. Every time J tells me that I shouldn't life a finger, I see K's sweet expression turn a little more sour. Eventually, she's grimacing & snaps at us along the lines of \"I don't get why he's spoiling you so much. This is too much, M never did this with me. Only spoiled & lazy people act like this. Plus, you have guests, have some decorum, the PDA is gross\".\n\nI'm like wtf. I was running around all damn morning like I'm not 5 months pregnant so I know damn well I'm not lazy. PDA? What fucking PDA? I'm pissed at her, my body, & J is getting up there. I snap right back at her \"Just b/c your husband didn't spoil your bitter ass, doesn't my husband can't spoil my apparently 'lazy' ass. Maybe you don't deserve it. And I've been busting my ass all morning & you call me fucking lazy? Girl fuck you\".\n\nShe cries & runs. I'm fuming but A is giving me that look that says I went too far. My other friends told me I was in the right but A ran after K & later texted me that M wasn't as invested in the K's pregnancy as he should have been & that I should have just let it go. AITA?\n\nAnyways this was fun y'all time for me to log out & never log back in. I'm going to try & meet with K to apologize. Maybe I'll update if things go absolute \ud83d\udca9shit\ud83d\udca9 or go \u2728stellar\u2728. Not in-between tho. Ok maybe I will.

Or that your husband was over concerned about your health and infantilizing you. That she went to spoiled and jealousy? That\u2019s who she is, then. \n\nBut you have to do things when you can and when you want to. So you need to push back against your husband. Especially when your friends are over. Maybe it doesn\u2019t bother you, but it bothers me that he just took over. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s worried about your health and the babies. Triplets. Not nothing. But still? When you can do things you must. You cannot become deconditioned and then deliver triplets. Please explain this to him. NTA\n\nOh, and your punishment for going too far? You\u2019re going to have to apologize to this\u2026 such and such. Please do that for your best friend who will probably stand behind you no matter what?

Say sorry.", "NTA you have the hormones of 4 people at the moment she is lucky your husband had you benched in my opinion because her comments would have had me finding a bat like Boo on Randall on Monsters Inc. like full on changing colors beating her. I was a bit of a rage monster when I was pregnant, but I worked on a fishing boat with clueless idiots. Anyway good for your husband for treating you like the queen you are and she can keep her bitterness away from your already stressful pregnancy. Also am a massage therapist of you do not mind a little advice, I loved giving pregnancy massage but you would need to check with your Dr if would be recommended because of your conditions. I do advise a body pillow between your legs and laying on your left side to take the strain off your lower back. Make sure body pillow is big enough so you can hug it as well as this aligns your spine. Also look into Mama Mio Lucky Legs Creme. Is cooling and helps with swelling. All their mama products are great. Congratulations and I wish you all the best for your expanding family.", "ESH. She was very rude and so were you. Try not to one up insults, it makes you smaller.

He had to insert himself into the situation and force you to rest. Which put your friends in the uncomfortable position of looking like the worst people in the world. They definitely felt judged by your husband. It turned from a friendship hang out to them still being present while a husband looked after his wife.

Have a safe delivery and enjoy newborn cuddles.", "You didn\u2019t know her situation, just as she didn\u2019t know yours.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t try to \u201cmake it up to her\u201d as such because she was the initial aggressor and if you hadn\u2019t snapped back, she would still have been in the wrong. (You just joined her there lol). \n\nApologize if you feel ok with it, absolutely. But don\u2019t grovel. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. I went too far. I\u2019m trying to not be a person who retaliates so viciously. My response was too harsh. \n\nSome people in the comments are investigating each individual tree and ignoring the forest fire. It did not seem in your story that you set up your hubs to show off    \n\nK is overly sensitive because of her private situation and she tried making it your problem, and when she did, she threw a lit match on a bunch of mixed chemicals that had been sitting there, fermenting all day long, that had nothing to do with her really, except for her comment being the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nI would apologize for the level of the explosion. You were pretty harsh. But catty comments are going to get catty responses and if she hasn\u2019t learned that at her big age, then it is past time. Maybe she\u2019ll think twice next time before exhibiting this behavior in the future. \n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t apologize back, be careful not to take all the blame in your apology. Some people will use that against you.", "No, she's really just A's friend. We're acquaintances and when we see each other at events A throws, it's a nice lil chat usually but we don't even have each other's numbers so anthing I hear about her, it's usually from A.\n\nYeah I took the low road and said that just to her. Idk how I'm going to make it up to her but I'm going to to start with an apology so ish me luck!", "Not just triplets but high BP and diabetes, not things to take lightly when growing three whole ass humans.", "I think a lot of people are unaware of the problems involved with multiples pregnancy. I'm surprised OP is not on bedrest already. Totally agree that having a tea party may not have been the best idea.", "THIS!!!!", "No it's just something I came up with. And I call copyright on all of it, for I have invented it.", "No, it does not.", "I am not. No where in this post have I said I'm proud of what I did and in several comments I have stated how embarrassed I am of the way I acted. How is that Showing I'm proud of being a dick?\n\nMy husband wasn't even supposed to be home at that time, he came home early. I'd didn't \"try\" to do that.", "Ah ha, upon further review it seems I just saw your comments in two different threads. I think that means your copyright claim is airtight.", "I cited my sources; how about you?", "NTA\n\nWho snaps at a hostess?  If she was sick of it all she could have excused herself due to an emergency text and hopped an Uber away.", "Let me get this straight...K can insult you, in your own home but you can't call her out and defend herself. You gave what she gave. NTA.", "NTA just because her man isn't a loving partner and didn't fuzz over her while she was pregnant doesn't mean she can't treat you badly. Is unfortunate but and so sorry for her but she was way out of line. Not you. You don't to People's houses to hate and envy them", "NTA, but I would have gone with the saccharine sweet polite voice and said, \u201cI\u2019m busy growing three humans at once, please remind me how many you grew at once?\u201d", "nta. you barely know her and she came into YOUR home disrespecting you and your husband I wouldn't even think to apologize. and there was no nice way of putting what you said and anyone who thinks so is delusional. you could've been ruder and I'd still say NTA", "Lmao I can hear the \"girl fuck you\" in my head, I say it all the time \ud83d\ude06\n\nBut anyways ESH. K's issues are clearly not with you, their her husband, she had right (and in your own home at that) to say what she said. Should've just left.\n\nBut girl, did you really have to say she didn't deserve to be spoiled? Everything else in your reply was warranted in my opinion but the \"don't deserve it\" come on sister! Be better than that.\n\nNow, considering that you're carrying 3 of his babies at once, yeah he better be spoiling the hell out of you. And you should not be denying help!? YOURE *FIVE MONTHS PREGNANT WITH TRIPLETS* FOR GOD SAKE. You are one wacky lady.\n\nLet me tell you, if we're you, there'd be no tea parties at 5 months with triplets. I'd be in bed 24/7 with several shirtless male servants feeding grapes and reading me my books, with are you thinking hosting such an event at this time and then refusing help. REST.", "op=NTA\n\nK was Totally out of line.  Sad for her but she chose M as her partner, got pregnant by that partner and chose to stay with a partner who couldn't be arsed to care about her pregnancy.  Those were her choices.  Not on you. \n\nAlso triplets--did she have triplets?(and other health issues?)\n\nIt was on A as the person who invited her along to corral her instead of chastising YOU.  She should have been defending you to K from the first crack.", "NTA the truth hurts. \n\nHer husband clearly wasn\u2019t there for her much during the pregnancy so she is jealous. That\u2019s not your problem and you\u2019re having twins. \n\nAlso congratulations \ud83e\udd73", "NTA. Personally, I don't think K deserves an apology until she apologizes first for being a shitty guest/person. Secondly, A brought her along. A knows your situation. A should be more understanding of you than anything. Especially as a BFF. Plus, hormones. So yeah.... Anyway, you look at it, NTA.", "Nta she had it coming. If she has any issues  then she should have directed her problem with her child's father. It's not your fault that your husband spoiled you. She was rude don't apologize", "NTA", "AGREED \u203c\ufe0f", "Honestly if she stays so bad at accepting help chances are very high she won't be pregnant for very much longer. Triplet pregnancies are high risk for a reason, the median pregnancy lasts only 32 weeks. Resting and eating help a lot in keeping those babies inside but even then there's so many complicating factors. Also, once those babies are born they will need alllll the help, there will be times when those newborns will all think that clusterfeeding is the best idea ever, while also being so refluxy you have to keep them vertical for 45 mins after each fees and shitting their fresh nappies if you blink twice", "from your post and this comment, it seems you fly off the handle quite easily", "I wouldn't call it \"pretty tame\" under the circumstances and you are well within your rights to be upset with her, so a little bit of wild beast is warranted.  I'm glad to hear you're willing to apologize - put peace to the situation.  You don't need this hanging over your head with your kiddos on the way!!  Best of luck with the pregnancy!!", "THANK YOU !!!!!", "\u201cHe\u2019s frantic & too worried.\u201d", "everyone should be showing off how amazing their partner is... like that's very normal", "Ikr? I was really surprised by that, too.", "ESH. You never should have put yourself in this position just to be a good host. You should know your body and should have known you were doing too much. You started this entire situation.", "NTA we might be twin souls. This is the first time someone said what I hoped. God bless you and your babies.", "NTA. That wasn't their place to critique whatever the hell was happening between OP and her husband. Period.  She fucked around and found out. Next time chick wiil.keep her mouth shut about isht that doesn't concern her.", "Presumptuous af", "I'm guessing that you were thinking, \"I got this!!!\" And when you started to lag you were upset at your own body failing to keep up with your mind/enthusiasm? Give yourself a bit of grace and accept help when offered. And ask for help when not offered. \n\nThe deserved comment was not true nor kind. The jealous comment was true, but not kind. You can apologize, but please know that what K said was inappropriate and unkind, as well.\n\nWishing you all the good things with the bubs. And tell J that the internet thinks he's going to be a great dad. \u2764\ufe0f", "If she can't take it she shouldn't dish it out, especially in your home. If I were you I wouldn't apologize, she's the one that should apologize for her behavior.", "You're all good. It is his fault - he's the other half of this baby concoction you have incubating. You do the growing, he gets the blame. \ud83d\ude09", "Why are you useless? Because you're pregnant?", "If you're attacked it's not wrong to fight back", "That's some straight up projection. \n\nFirst, she should be proud that her partner wants to make things easy on her - she's carrying three of their children at once. \n\nSecond, the post seems more annoyed at the fact that her body won't let her, then her husband won't let her, and then K decides to pee in her cereal. \n\nDoes everyone's partner want to take so much care of them? No. And often, not that much care needs to be taken at this point in a pregnancy. But multiples can be high risk (i.e.,   OP's mentions of high BP, diabetes, and back pain) and sometimes not all will make it. Particularly if you overdo things.", "There's very little evidence that bed rest is advisable almost ever, and there is evidence it can actually be harmful. I was shocked when I learned how common it is in the US, really not so much in the rest of the world, but it makes people feel like they're \"doing something\" so doctors keep prescribing it. Obviously, a level of rest is good and important, but full on bed rest is very uncommon in many countries with lower maternal mortality rates than the USA.", "When you said Opie I thought you were talking about one of the guys from Souls of Mischief lol.\nEdit: never mind, his name is Opio", "Uncommon in the US in a normal pregnancy but we do like to get the babies to 7 months or so, hence bedrest for some.", "Absolutely. She can be promoted to kitchen supervisor \ud83d\ude06", "Other countries also like to get babies as close to term as possible. There is little to no evidence that bedrest helps this, even in high risk pregnancies, hence doctors in other countries not encouraging it. Indeed, many Doctors in the US are against it, too, but it's hard when something is so normalised and people are so desperate for something to be done to help them https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20048007"]}
