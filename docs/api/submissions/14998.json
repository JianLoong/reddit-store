This is our 1st (& last--one & done!) pregnancy. Due to this being my 1st pregnancy & it's multiples, it's really tough. My morning sickness is insane, BP always high,  diabetes & anemia are back, lower back is in hell, there's an elephant on my pelvis & a whole lot of other shit.\n\nJ has been my rock (even though this is his fault) & spoils & treats me like a queen. He never says no & gives me stuff w/o asking. If it was up to him I'd be in bed all day & w/ 1000 servants.\n\nThe other week, I invited A & other friends over for a tea-tasting session b/c my aunt sent some from home. A asked if she could bring her friend K & I said OK. I've met K & M a few times before. They're nice people, K's real sweet & M gives aloof but with K, she just brings out a warmth in him. They have a 7 month baby.\n\nThe girls came over for tea & I'm doing everything b/c I'm the host & I want to feel not useless. They  offer help but I decline & ban them from the kitchen. I've been running back forth since before they came & eventually, it started to catch up with me. I'm running w/ a tray of treats & J comes home & sees me huffing & puffing & drops everything to check on me & help.\n\nHe's frantic & too worried, ushers me to the special chair in our living room & adjusts it. Doesn't even address my guests & they're staring & giggling & it's slightly embarrassing. He runs & grabs all the things that make me comfortable & sets it near me. I try to stop him but he has none of it. The girls are teasing me & telling me lucky & I'm hoping he relaxes.\n\nHe eventually continues what I was doing & is now the one bringing treats & refilling teas. I try to help again but he keeps telling me to relax & that I shouldn't have to lift a finger. I, a little frustrated & stubborn, still try. Every time J tells me that I shouldn't life a finger, I see K's sweet expression turn a little more sour. Eventually, she's grimacing & snaps at us along the lines of \"I don't get why he's spoiling you so much. This is too much, M never did this with me. Only spoiled & lazy people act like this. Plus, you have guests, have some decorum, the PDA is gross\".\n\nI'm like wtf. I was running around all damn morning like I'm not 5 months pregnant so I know damn well I'm not lazy. PDA? What fucking PDA? I'm pissed at her, my body, & J is getting up there. I snap right back at her \"Just b/c your husband didn't spoil your bitter ass, doesn't my husband can't spoil my apparently 'lazy' ass. Maybe you don't deserve it. And I've been busting my ass all morning & you call me fucking lazy? Girl fuck you\".\n\nShe cries & runs. I'm fuming but A is giving me that look that says I went too far. My other friends told me I was in the right but A ran after K & later texted me that M wasn't as invested in the K's pregnancy as he should have been & that I should have just let it go.

Anyway good for your husband for treating you like the queen you are and she can keep her bitterness away from your already stressful pregnancy. Also am a massage therapist of you do not mind a little advice, I loved giving pregnancy massage but you would need to check with your Dr if would be recommended because of your conditions. I do advise a body pillow between your legs and laying on your left side to take the strain off your lower back. Make sure body pillow is big enough so you can hug it as well as this aligns your spine. Also look into Mama Mio Lucky Legs Creme. Is cooling and helps with swelling. All their mama products are great. Congratulations and I wish you all the best for your expanding family.", "ESH. She was very rude and so were you. Try not to one up insults, it makes you smaller.

Grow up.", "ESH\n\nOP you sound exhausting and have a really bad attitude coming off. \n> J has been my rock (even though this is his fault)\nIt's not his fault. This comment shows how little respect for your husband who's going over the moon for you and you're pregnancy. Sounds like he didn't force this upon you and you weren't resisting while he had you on your back.\n\nK was out of line. But watching the two of you ignore everyone else feels gross. Having a doting partner isn't what I would call \"common\". Several men miss the mark and have painful growing pains stepping up into the role. Doesn't make her right, but you're overreaction was cruel. \n\nLearn from this. Your situation isn't common and be thankful for your husband's love everyday. You lucked out that you have him and you need to speak respectfully of someone caring to your needs.", "I feel a lot of sympathy for K and it sounds pretty insufferable to listen to the back and forth but\u2026 the way you describe her is lovely, and you said you\u2019ve met her only a couple times?? Then she insulted you in your own house? Saying she doesn\u2019t deserve it probably hit her pretty hard. But she can\u2019t say something like that and expect to be treated kindly in response. This could be a really great moment to extend an olive branch by specifically apologizing to her about the deserving comment while explaining how incredibly rude and disrespectful her comments were - but only if you would like to, and wouldn\u2019t blame you if you refused to speak to her again.", "Diabetes is back? What\u2019s the back story there?", "NTA", "NTA", "Huge NTA... who in their right mind makes a comment like that and call a pregnant woman with triplets lazy. Also, who comments on how someone's husband treats them. Just because hers didn't do make her have the right to say what she did. Also, if your husband was giving you PDA... who the hell cares. You said exactly what you should've said and maybe she will think before she opens her mouth and say another stupid comment like that to another person. Also congrats and I wish you a safe pregnancy and healthy delivery.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault her husband is useless. Your response was gold, and the empathy you could have given her went out the window the second she attacked you. Gross behaviour.", "NTA. this is one of the many reasons why i will never give birth. K made an extremely inappropriate comment, & I feel sad for her that she didn\u2019t have help during her pregnancy, but it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. the comment was wrong & youre 5 months pregnant with triplets on top of it. A should have never brought K if she knew how doting your husband is & how not K\u2019s was. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to apologize though, especially knowing how vulnerable pregnancy makes a person. she needs to apologize to you too tho. good luck with the rest of your pregnancy", "NTA, This is yet another example of a human who is pissed off at thier own poor life choices and even more pissed that someone else made better life choices.", "NTA. Your husband sounds like a very caring and loving husband and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be loads of help when those three little babies come. She seems like she is just jealous because of the attention your husband is giving you.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was bitter and jealous. \n\nYou way over reacted and were mean back. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus - let your husband spoil you. Let him have that honor.", "Nta on the *specific* question but your husband is also an ahole for treating you like you no longer have the capacity to live your life.  He's frantic and worried bc.......you were making tea? After declining help?  And you're just fine with him over riding your bodily autonomy??", "Screw turning the other cheek because of a situation you're not privy to. Just because K's husband was trash for her pregnancy doesn't give her the right to be rude to you and yours. And it's great that A is there for K, but she shouldn't be making excuses for her and trying to get you to put up with that crap in your own home. NTA\n\nCongrats on the baby and awesome hubby.", "K was insulting you in your own home. You tried to protest your position of the cuddled one, but was refuted by your husband. The fact that K's partner apparently is an inconsiderate Arsehole, doesn't mean you should feel guilty.\n\nAnd especially because of the *way* in which she addressed you, NTA. She had this coming.", "You were perfectly justified in saying something sharp; she was extremely rude. \n\nBut you said quite a lot, and I think it cost you some of the moral high ground. Leaning towards ESH, tbh.", "NTA if you make a rude comment to someone who is pregnant then that pregnant woman is legally allowed to eat your soul.", "So she was jealous. That simple. She wanted what you have and decided to make you feel bad about having what she wants. She is the AH!", "I actually think OP should take better care if herself. Let the guests help, don't fight hubby when he says she should sit down and relax. There's a much higher risk with triplets for complications and premature birth.", "> a pregnant someone \n\nFrom OP - I'm 5 months pregnant w/ triplets. \n\n \n\nA TRIPLE pregnant someone no less... \n\nNTA OP - You need all the spoiling you can get.", "who cares about how you feel? are you so self centered you\u2019d expect to be welcomed and treated first rather then his PREGNANT gf or wife? LOL soft ass", "I'm guessing he didn't acknowledge her guests because of his concern. She probably looked exhausted, he walks in and sees her doing all the work and her friends just sitting there. He wouldn't know she told them not to help, so why would he give them any priority?", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go as far as ESH but I completely agree that OP needs to get better about accepting help. I get that it\u2019s frustrating to have these limitations on what you can do, but both OP and her husband are going to burn out if they can\u2019t let others pitch in.", ">J has been my rock (even though this is his fault) It's not his fault. This comment shows how little respect for your husband\n\nYou can't be serious. This was obviously not meant to be taken seriously.", "Pretty sure that was a joke dude", "Yeah, I\u2019m sort of at NTA but the \u201cmaybe you don\u2019t deserve it\u201d went beyond responding to the immediate situation to a personal attack. \nJealousy for sure but that hints at some two-way toxicity in this friendship. \n\nAnd what\u2019s up with op\u2019s comment about how her misery is her husband\u2019s fault? Why - because he got her pregnant? Comments like that aren\u2019t cute. They\u2019re just dumb and it makes me wonder if OP guilt trips him into things like \u201cI\u2019m so uncomfortable and it\u2019s all your fault\u201d which would be really childish", "Not really", "You're trying to police how a woman carrying triplets speaks in her own home???\n\nNah.", "Yes I'm 9ne those stubborn ppl even b4 I was pregnant, I have liver disease and had to go through a ton of surgeries and procedures and I still tend to be reckless, my husband teaching me I shouldn't and it's a hard habit to ignore and just rely on ppl", "I was pregnant with twins. Never again! I can't imagine triplets at month 5. I think I wouldn't bothered with hosting and just told people to serve themselves. As for PDA and performative?! Yeah, you can fuck right off with that.", "I feel the same, I'm completely fkin useless now and my husband currently banned me from taking our toddler to school until baby born", "Yeah she's having triplets. This isn't a normal pregnancy at all and I think her pushing herself like this may not have been the best idea. But what K did in someone else's home is still pretty fucked. NTA.", "I mean... if I went over to my very pregnant friends house and she tried to be hostess I'd have followed her in the kitchen despite her protests and at least *carried* stuff if I didn't know what to do or where everything was. I wouldn't take no for an answer. Then again, that could be a cultural thing, I'm an Aussie and I'd rather be insistent like that than be waited on. XD", "OP and her husband sound a little performative and insufferable, tbh.", "Honestly, it sounds like if OP had let her friends help then K would have been judging her for being lazy anyway.", "And it's a triplet pregnancy so it's much different than a singleton", "I know the ESH is an unpopular opinion. I was just trying to imagine how I would feel if I was sat in my friends house awkwardly watching her husband intimately pamper her after she refused to let us serve ourselves. I wouldn't say anything, but a part of me would wonder if she arranged this just to show off how amazing her husband is. Because the rational thing would be to let your friends help out so you'll can have girly talk and share pregnancy tips, tricks and discomforts while your husband chills in another part of the house.", "If you think a hormonal pregnant lady with one baby can be cranky, i imagine a triplet pregnancy being much worse because that's A LOT of hormones", "Tbh I would find that super uncomfortable - I ro think whe should've discussed with her husband about getting tired rather than being insistent just purely from a health perspective. But maybe it is a cultural thing bc I cannot stand when people rush to help in my home if I've invited them. She's NTA", "She is expecting fucking triplets (congrats OP!). Her partner is fully entitled to being fussy. And OP to be flagging a bit during hosting.", "Seriously?! Her husband was worried for her safety, and that's performative now?!", "How, she is having triplets LOL I'm high risk and 35wks with just one and I'm fkin dying even b4 when I was 12wks or 20wks I was dying. I can't even imagine how op is feeling with fkin triplets at 5mos.\n\nHer husband is ofc worried, so is mines, he already banned me from walking our toddler to the school bus from now on because I nearly fainted last night", "My doctor would have yelled at me if he'd caught me trying to do what OP was doing. I had twins, and was not supposed to be running around waiting on other people while I was pregnant."]}
