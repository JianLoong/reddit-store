This is our 1st (& last--one & done!) pregnancy. Due to this being my 1st pregnancy & it's multiples, it's really tough. My morning sickness is insane, BP always high,  diabetes & anemia are back, lower back is in hell, there's an elephant on my pelvis & a whole lot of other shit.\n\nJ has been my rock (even though this is his fault) & spoils & treats me like a queen. He never says no & gives me stuff w/o asking. If it was up to him I'd be in bed all day & w/ 1000 servants.\n\nThe other week, I invited A & other friends over for a tea-tasting session b/c my aunt sent some from home. A asked if she could bring her friend K & I said OK. I've met K & M a few times before. They're nice people, K's real sweet & M gives aloof but with K, she just brings out a warmth in him. They have a 7 month baby.\n\nThe girls came over for tea & I'm doing everything b/c I'm the host & I want to feel not useless. They  offer help but I decline & ban them from the kitchen. I've been running back forth since before they came & eventually, it started to catch up with me. I'm running w/ a tray of treats & J comes home & sees me huffing & puffing & drops everything to check on me & help.\n\nHe's frantic & too worried, ushers me to the special chair in our living room & adjusts it. Doesn't even address my guests & they're staring & giggling & it's slightly embarrassing. He runs & grabs all the things that make me comfortable & sets it near me. I try to stop him but he has none of it. The girls are teasing me & telling me lucky & I'm hoping he relaxes.\n\nHe eventually continues what I was doing & is now the one bringing treats & refilling teas. I try to help again but he keeps telling me to relax & that I shouldn't have to lift a finger. I, a little frustrated & stubborn, still try. Every time J tells me that I shouldn't life a finger, I see K's sweet expression turn a little more sour. Eventually, she's grimacing & snaps at us along the lines of \"I don't get why he's spoiling you so much. This is too much, M never did this with me. Only spoiled & lazy people act like this. Plus, you have guests, have some decorum, the PDA is gross\".\n\nI'm like wtf. I was running around all damn morning like I'm not 5 months pregnant so I know damn well I'm not lazy. PDA? What fucking PDA? I'm pissed at her, my body, & J is getting up there. I snap right back at her \"Just b/c your husband didn't spoil your bitter ass, doesn't my husband can't spoil my apparently 'lazy' ass. Maybe you don't deserve it. And I've been busting my ass all morning & you call me fucking lazy? Girl fuck you\".\n\nShe cries & runs. I'm fuming but A is giving me that look that says I went too far. My other friends told me I was in the right but A ran after K & later texted me that M wasn't as invested in the K's pregnancy as he should have been & that I should have just let it go.

She brought her rude, jealous self to a situation to trigger her own issues.  Then spewed it out onto a happy occasion in your home.  Sorry, she had a bad experience with her SO, but she didn't need to bring that to your doorstep.  She should know better than to want to add stress to the situation when obviously you were in a stressed situation based upon the reaction of your husband.  Plus, who messes with a hormonal pregnant woman like that and doesn't expect a throwdown?", "NTA. And not to downplay it but I mean, she gave birth to one. You have 3. It's already hard on you and it's only going to get worse. So ofc he's going to be more extra with you than he probably would be if it was just 1. You deserve it, that ish is hard.\n\nShe's just jealous and saying so was out of line. If she was uncomfortable she should have just made an excuse to leave.", "NTA. K should have stopped at telling you how lucky you are. But I wouldn't hold a grudge. I wonder how M treats K.\n\nAnd triplets? I don't think your husband can spoil you enough.", "Who goes to someone's house - a pregnant someone - and insults them? A H that's who.\nNTA, OP.", "NTA K's problem is with M, not you or J. She's lashing out at you because she knows trying with M is barking up the wrong tree. I hope she's realized she's worth more than that, but that doesn't make it okay to take it out on other people.", "NTA, I also had a \u2018one & done pregnancy\u2019 also with multiples (currently 7 months old) & my husband treated me like a queen as well. By 4 months pregnant I already looked like i was due.

Like they get served but it's not really a group thing(?)\n\n Also these discussions (or at least everlasting comments) between your husband and you sound really annoying, if it really goes on and on and on.", "Definitely NTA like girl, sorry that my husband is better than yours.", "Triplets. Incredible NTA. Also, You'll hear much unsolicited parenting advice that will annoy you. That's stuff you can just let go. Standing up for  your family is ALWAYS the right choice. IDGAF that woman is classless and disturbed to insult you in such a manner and her tears are just a fake shield to stop anyone from calling her out and put the focus on how you reacted to her unprovoked attack. (DARVO) She would never set foot in my house again. Most would never even THINK such horrid things especially another mother. \n\nI hope you have the easiest pregnancy and labor possible. You are a superstar!", "LMAOOOO sooooo NTA WTF. Like sorry I married a man and you married a boy? God I hate my gender sometimes", "NTA", "NTA, your friends was so wrong to be jealous you were getting help from your husband. You\u2019re pregnant and with triplets.\nAlthough I do think you will a bit harsh with your response.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds bitter and jealous and you definitely should cut ties with her completely. If your BFF asks to bring her around again tell her no unless it's for an apology. It's not your fault her husband wasn't as invested as yours is being.", "NTA. That was exactly the right response. The nerve.", "NTA.\n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t have snapped. Should have kept your calm and say it out minus the profanities.   \n\n\nWho gives two hoots about K\u2019s pregnancy? I wouldn\u2019t. Neither should your friend A because K should have the guts to tell her hubby how useless he is.", "You went too far. You did. But I\u2019m not voting you to be the asshole because you are pregnant with triplets, girl. \n\nAnd because K behaved even worse. I would\u2019ve been concerned for you that either you were less well then you were trying to be when you were making tea and cookies yourself? Or that your husband was over concerned about your health and infantilizing you. That she went to spoiled and jealousy? That\u2019s who she is, then. \n\nBut you have to do things when you can and when you want to. So you need to push back against your husband. Especially when your friends are over. Maybe it doesn\u2019t bother you, but it bothers me that he just took over. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s worried about your health and the babies. Triplets. Not nothing. But still? When you can do things you must. You cannot become deconditioned and then deliver triplets. Please explain this to him. NTA\n\nOh, and your punishment for going too far? You\u2019re going to have to apologize to this\u2026 such and such. Please do that for your best friend who will probably stand behind you no matter what? Acknowledge your wrongdoing whatever you feel it to be. Say sorry.", "NTA you have the hormones of 4 people at the moment she is lucky your husband had you benched in my opinion because her comments would have had me finding a bat like Boo on Randall on Monsters Inc. like full on changing colors beating her. I was a bit of a rage monster when I was pregnant, but I worked on a fishing boat with clueless idiots. Anyway good for your husband for treating you like the queen you are and she can keep her bitterness away from your already stressful pregnancy. Also am a massage therapist of you do not mind a little advice, I loved giving pregnancy massage but you would need to check with your Dr if would be recommended because of your conditions. I do advise a body pillow between your legs and laying on your left side to take the strain off your lower back. Make sure body pillow is big enough so you can hug it as well as this aligns your spine. Also look into Mama Mio Lucky Legs Creme. Is cooling and helps with swelling. All their mama products are great. Congratulations and I wish you all the best for your expanding family.", "ESH. She was very rude and so were you. Try not to one up insults, it makes you smaller. She hurt your pride, but you have nothing to be shameful of, so try: \u201cyeah it would be easy to become lazy with such an amazing husband. And with guests who say mean things when I invite them into my home, I don\u2019t think decorum\u2019s the main problem. I\u2019m happy to ask my lovely husband to refilled your tea or get you more snacks?\u201d", "NTA but this made me laugh\n\n>She cries & runs. \n\n Such a female response.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You weren\u2019t lazy, you are pregnant with triplets (I\u2019ve had twins so I feel for you, two was hard I can\u2019t imagine 3 in there). Weather or not it was PDA is debatable (you weren\u2019t like making out, but repeatedly trying to help while your partner tells you you don\u2019t have to lift a finger does seem pretty publicly affectionate), but regardless she was completely out of line saying that to you.

I get why A thinks you might have worded your answer too harshly, but in all honesty: You're pregnant with triplets right now. Your body's probably giving you a hard enough time already and your hormonal changes aren't always a joy to have to deal with. Therefore, I wouldn't assume tone-policing is adequate here - especially with her friend being rude first. \n\nYou can show understanding for both sides without having to admonish one or the other - especially in this case. Your comment wasn't the nicest one, but neither were hers. As A knew why K reacted this way, it would have been sufficient to try to talk to you about why she acted the way she did while also acknowledging that she shouldn't have done that. Your reaction might have been harsh, but also understandable. \n\nAnd if she's still carrying around this grudge to this degree, she might want to try to talk to M about her own grievances.
