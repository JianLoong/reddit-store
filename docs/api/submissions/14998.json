This is our 1st (& last--one & done!) pregnancy. Due to this being my 1st pregnancy & it's multiples, it's really tough. My morning sickness is insane, BP always high,  diabetes & anemia are back, lower back is in hell, there's an elephant on my pelvis & a whole lot of other shit.\n\nJ has been my rock (even though this is his fault) & spoils & treats me like a queen. He never says no & gives me stuff w/o asking. If it was up to him I'd be in bed all day & w/ 1000 servants.\n\nThe other week, I invited A & other friends over for a tea-tasting session b/c my aunt sent some from home. A asked if she could bring her friend K & I said OK. I've met K & M a few times before. They're nice people, K's real sweet & M gives aloof but with K, she just brings out a warmth in him. They have a 7 month baby.\n\nThe girls came over for tea & I'm doing everything b/c I'm the host & I want to feel not useless. They  offer help but I decline & ban them from the kitchen. I've been running back forth since before they came & eventually, it started to catch up with me. I'm running w/ a tray of treats & J comes home & sees me huffing & puffing & drops everything to check on me & help.\n\nHe's frantic & too worried, ushers me to the special chair in our living room & adjusts it. Doesn't even address my guests & they're staring & giggling & it's slightly embarrassing. He runs & grabs all the things that make me comfortable & sets it near me. I try to stop him but he has none of it. The girls are teasing me & telling me lucky & I'm hoping he relaxes.\n\nHe eventually continues what I was doing & is now the one bringing treats & refilling teas. I try to help again but he keeps telling me to relax & that I shouldn't have to lift a finger. I, a little frustrated & stubborn, still try. Every time J tells me that I shouldn't life a finger, I see K's sweet expression turn a little more sour. Eventually, she's grimacing & snaps at us along the lines of \"I don't get why he's spoiling you so much. This is too much, M never did this with me. Only spoiled & lazy people act like this. Plus, you have guests, have some decorum, the PDA is gross\".\n\nI'm like wtf. I was running around all damn morning like I'm not 5 months pregnant so I know damn well I'm not lazy. PDA? What fucking PDA? I'm pissed at her, my body, & J is getting up there. I snap right back at her \"Just b/c your husband didn't spoil your bitter ass, doesn't my husband can't spoil my apparently 'lazy' ass. Maybe you don't deserve it. And I've been busting my ass all morning & you call me fucking lazy? Girl fuck you\".\n\nShe cries & runs. I'm fuming but A is giving me that look that says I went too far. My other friends told me I was in the right but A ran after K & later texted me that M wasn't as invested in the K's pregnancy as he should have been & that I should have just let it go.

Anyway good for your husband for treating you like the queen you are and she can keep her bitterness away from your already stressful pregnancy. Also am a massage therapist of you do not mind a little advice, I loved giving pregnancy massage but you would need to check with your Dr if would be recommended because of your conditions. I do advise a body pillow between your legs and laying on your left side to take the strain off your lower back. Make sure body pillow is big enough so you can hug it as well as this aligns your spine. Also look into Mama Mio Lucky Legs Creme. Is cooling and helps with swelling. All their mama products are great. Congratulations and I wish you all the best for your expanding family.", "ESH. She was very rude and so were you. Try not to one up insults, it makes you smaller.

I'm glad you stood up to her and didn't just accept her judgement or apologize when you've done nothing wrong.  Your hubs may come across as a bit over the top, but this pregnancy has a good bit of complications and he wants to help out where he can.

Obviously what K said was outrageously rude and uncalled for, but OP and her husband\u2019s behavior (refusing help to the point of physical distress, failure to address guests, excessively fussing over he and probably making guests feel bad for even being there) is pretty poor hosting etiquette in my opinion.", "I\u2019m just here to say that if I was pregnant with triplets I\u2019d probably take to my bed and cuss people out as a greeting.

I can only imagine how exhausting it is to carry multiples but it is hardly an emergency- if it was she shouldnt have been banning people from the kitchen until she is on the verge of a medical emergency.

If my friend was pregnant and was running around trying to serve people I would have done more than offer to help. I agree that OP shouldn't overwork herself. But she is definitely not the ah for trying to take care of her guests. The only reason the friend lashed out was due to her own insecurity, and chose to be cruel to a pregnant lady.
