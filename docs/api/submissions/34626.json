{"id": 34626, "submission_id": "191vizq", "title": "AITA for going to a hotel to avoid MIL?", "selftext": "My MIL is a good woman, make no mistakes. I'm not trying to paint her in a bad light here. I do love her but I'm so resentful of her that it's clouding my brain. She has this overwhelming desire to feel needed and comes over here whenever she finds out any of us are ill. Even if we tell her no, she will still show up. And like... She doesn't help. That's the thing. She comes here with a can of chicken noodle soup and then stands in front of our TV or tries endlessly to get us to talk to her, knowing I have zero energy to entertain. Even when my husband and I had COVID. He told her and she showed up here and despite seeing that we were trying to rest, still attempted to get us to drink coffee with her and hang out in the kitchen. When we tell her to leave, it's always met with a \"I will be fine\" (thinking we are telling her to leave for her safety, which isn't the case 9 times out of 10). And it's happened so damn frequently (my husband has a weak immune system) that I don't want her here half the time, even on a good day.\n\nWe now have a 4 month old daughter. But Little Miss is feeling a bit under the weather (just a cold- she's been seen by her pediatrician). My husband gets a phone call from his mom earlier and he ends up telling her that the baby is a bit sick. After he gets off the phone I tell him that she had better not come here (him and I have discussed this in the past so he's fully aware how irritated it makes me when she shows up here while we are ill). He said \"well she said she was going to swing by\". I told him to call her back and tell her not to come and that I don't want her here. I told him to blame me. So, he did call her but he walked out of the room so I didn't hear the conversation. Next thing I know she's knocking on the door. He answers and says \"I told you you didn't have to come\" and she says \"I know but I figured I'm needed\". As soon as I heard this I honestly just started dressing the baby and packing an overnight bag. She comes in to the room and says \"where ya going?\" So I said \"to a hotel\" and pushed past her with the baby. She DOES know that I don't want her here when we are sick because I've told her that I don't want ANYONE here when we are sick, so it shouldn't have come as any surprise. Both my husband and MIL started protesting but I didn't even catch what they said. I just took off. My husband has been texting me ever since, saying I overreacted and that his mom simply wants to help but I argue that I truly don't need her \"help\", which consists of her just taking up my space and energy. I also didn't need her fussing over my already sick baby and getting her even more sick because she should be resting. I won't come home, despite him asking me to and I also said he either tells her she's no longer welcome here when we are sick or I will have to make a decision on whether or not I want to deal with this going forward because it may not look like a big deal but it is to me. He says he \"can't believe how largely I'm blowing this out of proportion\". AITA?\n\nETA: the bizarre bit of this is that my husband is not close to his mom. It seems like he is from the post but he's not. She was barely around during his childhood (he was raised by his sister). So she calls him like once a week and the conversation lasts maybe 5 minutes and it consists of \"how is everyone\" and that's it. When she comes here, HE gets awkward and clams up and they barely say 2 words to each other. He also word vomits due to awkwardness and over shares our finances with her too, just to have something to talk about. He acts super weird around her. So when she comes here, she's usually up my ass and it's me who's entertaining. I think she only comes by when we are sick because she feels like a shit mom for not being around for his childhood and now she tries making up for it.", "created_utc": 1704746755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191vizq/aita_for_going_to_a_hotel_to_avoid_mil/", "score": 800, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's the AH. it's HIS mother HE needs to lay the law down. HE needs to be the bad guy. He clearly did not tell her \"no\" he told her \"you don't NEED\" to come by. He's using specific language to keep the door cracked so that she CAN come over. He needs to be firm. And honestly, why the hell does he keep telling his mother when people are sick?!?! Just.... don't share that and problem solved. He seems to let it \"slip\" that there is someone unwell every time to the point you have to think he likes being babied by his mother. It's weird AF. He needs to grow up and not go running to mommy every time he has the sniffles", "\nNTA -- husband needed to get clear on it\n\nThe problem is your husband. He's trying to have it both ways.

He needs to tell her both of you don't want visitors when you're sick -- ANY visitors.", "But that's a big deal, you're already so irritated with MIL and her boundary-pushing that you had to take a sick child and go to a hotel from the safety of your home.

Your husband didn\u2019t tell her not to come. Sounds like he told her she didn\u2019t have to come. Two different things. \n\nMaybe you shouldn\u2019t have stormed out but nothing else got their attention. Take the night to calm down and tomorrow when you go home, have a serious talk with your husband and tell him me must be honest and straight with his mother immediately. Seems like the conversation only happens after everyone is worked out and that won\u2019t resolve it.", "NTA. It was dramatic but when people are ignoring and disrespecting your boundaries sometimes going over the top is the only way to get people's attention. That being said, quit soft soaping your boundaries. Remember boundaries are what YOU will/not do. Do not say, 'I don't want you here when we are sick.' Instead, 'If you come over while we are sick, I won't let you in and if husband let's you in, I will kick you out.' \n\nPeople think they can run over your wants and needs, but it's a little different to be told they are going to be kicked out or left on the porch. Also, if he wants to be doted on by his Mom while ill, pack him up and take him over to her.", "In the future you should keep a go bag in the car. Diapers, wipes, a couple of outfits for you both and some toiletries. Then, when she does it again.

Because that's what your MIL is acting like, company. She's not acting like someone who is there to help.\n\nYour husband needs to fully understand this. It's your home, your sanctuary, your place of rest. And your MIL is turning it into a weird jail for the sick inmates who can't escape her need for attention. \n\nHold the line, OP. This line will protect you and your children and even your spineless husband from a lifetime of attention-seeking b.s. from MIL. At least, while you're sick.", "NTA. It\u2019s wild that she is told not to come but continues to do so. I think leaving was the only way you could deal with this finally. Please don\u2019t let your husband continue to minimize this intrusion into your home.

Your husband won't back you up with mommy dearest and doesn't understand how upsetting this is to you. Husband is using the old \"you're over reacting, she's just trying to help\". He's still not listening to you or taking this seriously. Unless he does accept this is your hill to die on, you have choices to make. Good luck.", "NTA\nYour husband is though.  He ia literally inviting his mother over,  knowing it irritates you and doesn't help in any way.  He needs a reality check, either she stays away or he won't be welcome in the house either.", "Your husband is the problem. He has some type of attachment to her, even if you say they are not close. He needs to handle this situation. It's his mother. He needs to firmly tell her not to come. If she does show up, don't answer the door. He also needs to learn to control himself on the phone with her. He doesn't need to be putting your finances out there to her. He doesn't need to be telling her every time someone is sick if it isn't serious.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a husband problem. He isn't managing his mother. Time for the dreaded ultimatum. He either gets his mother under control, or he goes back to her permanently. Do not waiver for a second.", "NTA it\u2019s so wild to tell someone their help isn\u2019t helpful and have them still insist. I hope your husband is able to hear you- stay strong!", "I am a firm believer that in a marriage, each partner handles their own family.\n\nYour husband needs to grow a backbone and inform his mother of the boundaries you and he discussed and agreed upon.\n\nYou might consider marriage counseling to put this issue on the table for resolution with your husband.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- but from what you\u2019ve added about his childhood, it sounds like mum is trying to repair her mistakes with your husband\u2018s childhood but is still totally ill-equipped to do so, and your husband either lacks the ability to communicate with her due to her poor mothering, or part of him wants her to step up, finally. This sounds like something for family therapy between them, if both are willing and able. However, that\u2019s not the question asked, and I can see why you left.", "NTA. What your husband seems to be missing is this event is just the straw that broke the camel's back. It was only a matter of time before you lost it and I don't think there's anyone who could blame you. I can't imagine having to entertain my MIL literally every time I'm sick or running around taking care of my sick baby. \n\nHopefully he can take time to think and understand. Or maybe some marriage counseling can help him see just how far past your boundaries he's allowed his mom to continually stomp.", "NTA. Your MIL is annoying and I fail to see how she's \"a good woman.\" No good person comes over unannounced and without invite, especially after they know it bothers you. No good person comes over and tries to get you to entertain them when you're ill. \n\nAnd your husband is the biggest AH in this scenario. For telling his mother when you all are sick, for not setting boundaries with her, and for not enforcing anything. Saying \"you don't need to come by,\" is not the same thing as, \"do not come over.\" \n\nThis is not a small thing that you are blowing out of proportion. Your husband does not respect you or care about what you need. And he didn't even have to deal with the consequences either - you took the sick kid with you. \n\nI would die on this hill and if he won't actually set and enforce boundaries, I'd leave him. I've read that divorce is especially hard on kids that are elementary school aged. You can do it now when the baby is still young.", "NTA. MIL needs to respect boundaries, but also husband needs to do so as well. It's reasonable to not want guests when someone in the home is sick. Your husband needs to get on board with that and start ENFORCING that boundary with his mom. Right now, he's not supporting you in that and that's a problem.  While I do think your reaction was a bit on the extreme end, I can understand that you are frustrated if this is a recurrent problem and also probably stressed dealing with a sick baby. Maybe you and your husband seeking outside professional help will help you see eye to eye on the matter.", "NTA - Sorry to hear about your husband problem. \n\nHopefully this will be a wake up call.", "NTA, way to stand your ground!", "Nta! She thinks she's the main character, and that you all need her in order to get better", "NTA.  And it's another of these \"Can't see the forest for the trees.\" things.\n\nTo them, she came over and you left so it looks like an overreaction because they are only seeing this one time.\n\nYou have to make it clear that it's not just this one time.  You have tried to set that boundary over and over and both of them are ignoring it.  That means they are ignoring *you* and that makes you feel like you are unimportant.", "NTA. You communicated the issue very clearly to your husband all along the way. Your MIL needs to learn some boundaries, but more importantly, your husband needs to step up.", "NTA- you have a husband problem and a stubborn MIL problem. Your husband has decided that MIL\u2019s feelings are more important than your boundaries. He\u2019s putting her first over the family he created with you. That is not ok. I recommend couples counseling. He hasn\u2019t detached himself from the umbilical cord to his Mother and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to play hostess when you\u2019re sick. If he won\u2019t go, and this is your \u201chill to die on\u201d, then you can tell him he can go stay with his mother and you will start looking for an attorney.", "NTA. It's interesting that \"do not come over\" or \"you do not need to come over\" sounds like \"you are needed\" to MIL. I'm curious how your husband explains this. A definitive, clear and firm \"no. We are sick. Do not come\" should be hard to misinterpret. Your husband needs to stop with the word vomit to his mother. That is his circus and monkey to handle. So his lack of ability or willingness to enforce the family boundary of do not come over means he gets to reap the consequences! I would ask him why his need to pacify a woman he barely has a relationship with is more important than his wife and child. This has to stop now, or, you are correct, you will be dealing with this for the rest of her lifetime and it will get worse.", "NTA  I'm trying to fathom how someone could come over and \"hang out\" when you're sick with covid...\n\nIt definitely sounds like her trying to make up for not being there for him as a kid.  You can't trust you husband to tell her the right way, I think you both need to sit down with her and set the boundary.  If she breaks it and shows up, you will not open the door, or you will leave again like you did.", "Nta\n\n1) he needs to put is mOther on an information diet\n\n2) Get a ring doorbell and tell him not to open the door when his mother comes over unannounced\n\n3) Tell him to have a sit down with his mother and say that he doesn\u2019t want her to come over when someone sick\n\n4) Sometimes you need to take a bold stand to make a point", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
