They certainly can.", "NTA\n\nI would make this the last party that the ones fighting you about this are invited to. Next year only invite friends or relatives that can and will RESPECT your house and rules. \n\nNot all family are actually family.", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds like an alcoholic who finds any and every excuse to drink to excess. This is what happens to alcoholics as they spiral downward; people start rejecting them and disinviting them. It's harsh, but you have to do what's right for you, and that's to have a peaceful weekend without drama.", "Nta your lake house your rules she shown that she is not safe to be drinking", "NTA. Be prepared for her to show up anyhow. Family will try to push for her to stay. Honestly, hold your ground. It\u2019s for everyone\u2019s safety. Clearly she is out of control, but you and your husband are the only ones who are being honest about it.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  And anybody who has a problem with the rules you and your husband decided upon can be uninvited too.  This is your property.  You don't have to have anyone there who disrespects you or your husband.  If they want to have a drunken ragger, tell them to rent their own lake house but they're not using yours.", "NTA... this is the hill to die on. I like the idea of a substitute sober weekend. \nHonestly though if I had friends or family that I loved and we wanted to spend time with, we would forgo the alcohol.", "It sounds like an alcoholic and her enablers/deniers. Stick to your guns.", "Op she\u2019s gonna show up, just be prepared for that.", "NTA. Your SIL's drinking is a liability. It doesn't matter if she thinks her drinking is a big enough problem to address or not. You and your husband are not willing to take the risk of have her drunk at your home again. You have had to devote too much time and energy to keeping her safe, cleaning up after her, apologizing to people, worrying, etc. **She ended up in the hospital last time and you don't want to have to deal with this anymore.** It is unfair and unacceptable that she has to be babysat. She is a grown ass adult. If she can't abide by your rules, she cannot come to your home. Period. Any family member who thinks that is too harsh is welcome to boycott in solidarity. Let all communication go through your husband with his family. Drunks don't like accountability. Stay strong and have a plan for when she shows up, anyway.", "\"...she can't be the only one in the family not invited it would break her heart etc\". She can be, if she's the only one who can't behave. A grown adult should not need a babysitter. What she does need, is to ask herself why she's being excluded and take a good look at her drinking.  \n\n\nThe last thing you need is to be explaining to the police why she drowned off your dock.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA, this is a fair boundary and I actually think you\u2019re being a bit over-critical of yourselves with your ETA when you say you guys should have brought it up *again* earlier. She\u2019s a full grown adult who was already told one time, any reminder again before the trip is a courtesy. \n\nThis is good boundary setting. Keep communicating as kindly *and* clearly as possible - and I wouldn\u2019t recommend putting too much energy into engaging with all the enablers trying to tell you guys what to do right now.", "NTA.  I would have cancelled the whole thing after it getting escalated to all these people calling you.  One by one, I'd tell them sorry we've postponed the weekend indefinitely.  Then those that don't call can still come and have the time you intended to have.  Drama-free.", "This!! Whatever family members don\u2019t agree with your decision don\u2019t have to come either\u2026", "Hopping on this top comment just to say the SIL or family should look into the Sinclair Method and Neltrexon! She doesn't need to enter treatment to get help, her PCP should be able to prescribe this but she will still have to put effort into this working.", "NTA. But, if she is far enough down the alcoholic path, there\u2019s also a chance that refraining from drinking for a weekend could end with her in withdrawal. That\u2019s not going to spell a good time for anyone, either, and, if it\u2019s severe enough could be life threatening for her.\n\nThe only way to get around that would be to strictly *control* her consumption, but that would assuredly not go well. No one wants to spend their weekend policing another adult\u2019s behavior; she\u2019d undoubtedly try to get around it; and, with the family already split, it will devolve into a mess.\n\nSister shouldn\u2019t come. Period. Not even if she *promises* not to drink. It\u2019s a promise she\u2019s unlikely to be *able* to keep at this point, even if she really wanted to \u2014 which she doesn\u2019t. She needs to get medically assessed and into treatment, first. For everyone\u2019s sake. Problem is, OP & her husband would be called assholes if they insisted on that, too.", "Nobody would go after her. They'd still blame OP. Doubly so now as they see it as clear indication that OP is singling out the sister and bullying her (in their minds).\n\nIt may make things worse between OP and the family. (I don't necessarily disagree with doing it though, because I'm a bit petty lol).", "Literally the last thing an alcoholic needs it shame. Her behavior is not cool but no need to publicly shame her", "Hard agree. This is what I\u2019d do", "Was thinking this exact thing. Also, if everyone thats opposing OP and her husband even came, I would think they would be guilting them/arguing with them the whole vacation. That doesn\u2019t sound like fun\n\nNTA", "This should be higher up. The liability alone is enough to disinvite her.", "A real toddler would be easier to handle. I\u2019ll never make the mistake of misjudging the strength of an angry, drunk again lol", "Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf", "SIL is an alcoholic.  An alcoholic literally can't just drink less, that's not how their brains are wired.  The issues with this woman's drinking have been going on for several years; she's not some kid who overdid it once at college before learning moderation.", "The previous ER visit kind of proves she can't control herself. And because it's THEIR house, THEY could be liable if anything happens even worse. They're CYA and that's perfectly ok.", "She\u2019s already insistent on drinking alcohol. I sincerely doubt the sister will be willing pacify with fake booze.", "I agree. I have a friend that didn't stop drinking until it almost killed them. Didn't even stop when their daughter wrote them off for the drinking. NTA. Nothing like an emergency room visit to put a damper on a fun weekend", "I can list the things that have happened here but one involved a very scary trip to the ER.", "100% this.  Stop taking their calls, it\u2019s not worth it.  \n\nNTA", "I feel once you've gone to the ER due to your drinking you've singled yourself out \ud83d\ude0f\n\nBut it seems like most of them are on her case anyway. It's not like she has much to lose if she tries.", "Wish it was that simple but family being cut off for addiction is pretty shitty especially when others don\u2019t realize how bad it is. Burning one bridge might torch the 5 others if ya get what I mean", "You are doing her a favor. She won\u2019t change unless she is forced to confront who she really is.\n\nAlso, if you know she\u2019s going to drink and let her come, and especially if you provide alcohol to or make it accessible to her, and then she sneaks out and drives a car and kills some kids, or starts a fight and hurts someone, or does any number of shitty things, then you could be liable for what she does.\n\nPlus, even if you changed your mind at the last second, she\u2019s still going to be pissed off. And alcoholics are sneaky; she\u2019ll find a way to drink. A pissed off drunk alcoholic is much more likely to drive off in a rage, or start a fight, or throw something and hurt somebody. Bad idea. \n\nNTA. However, your husband may be if he\u2019s letting you take all the blame.", "Anyone who has an issue with sister not being allowed to drink can speak to me about it.", "Bot.", " It's your house, your party and you have a responsibility to your other guests.", "We had a former friend try to do this at my now husband\u2019s family lake house when we were in our early 20s. I hid all the keys from him and he started threatening people if they didn\u2019t reveal where they were. I told him he could fight me if he wanted them and I think that scared him off (I\u2019m 5\u20192\u2019\u2019 and he was 6\u20195\u2019\u2019 so that was a laughable thought). \n\nAnyway, he wasn\u2019t invited back."]}
