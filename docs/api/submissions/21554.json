This has swelled to be about thirty people. \n\nA lot of our friends use it as an excuse to leave behind the kid's for a weekend and there's a lot of partying involved. For the past two years, my SIL's behavior has been a major issue at these events. She completely loses control when drinking. I don't think I can list the things that have happened here but one involved a very scary trip to the ER. My husband and I have had so many talks that she needs treatment with his parents, but they're all in denial. \n\nAfter last year, we told her she can only come to the lake house if she promises to remain sober over the weekend. She threw a fit about it, we stood firm, but the topic was dropped. Yesterday, my husband called her to remind her of what we had said. She absolutely lost her shit. She thinks I'm trying to ban her because I don't like her (I really like her, when she's not drinking). My husband said he'll stay sober over the weekend too bc he knows it can be hard to be the only person not drinking. She didn't budge. Eventually, he said if she can't commit to not drinking she can't come. \n\nNow her aunt and cousin have gotten involved. They messaged me and said to let her come and they'll watch her the whole weekend to make sure she's okay. I said no dice. Then they started trying to say I was bullying her (this is a thirty year old woman), she's had such a hard time recently, she can't be the only one in the family not invited it would break her heart etc. I said she is invited, she just can't be drinking because it's not safe. They said that's not fair to her and if she can't drink no one should be and I said no, but if they wanted to plan a sober weekend next month that might be a good idea. They brushed off the idea because they're not actually interested in a sober weekend. Now my husband's parent's are getting involved and it's turning into this huge drama, we're all set to start arriving tonight. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I also wanted to say we do realize we probably should have brought this up again a few weeks ago instead of right before.", "created_utc": 1688720323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t1lki/aita_for_not_letting_husbands_sister_come_to_the/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either tell that because SIL wants to come and seeing the ER trip last time that there will no booze or drunk people allowed but since you already offered a drunk-less weekend and it was rejected it's not really an option and you shouldn't remove something you like for one person anyway. Other option is everyone complaining about this would gets an un-invite then she's not the only person not invited so that's a plus for her. Your place, your rules, which they clearly don't respect so why should they even come.\n\nSeeing how it's a bit late to do these options, personally, next year I would severely cut back on people invited since clearly they aren't coming for your companionship but to drink and most likely because it's a free weekend.

I don't drink by choice (I don't like it), but I know there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nAnd again, there's a big difference between getting drunk and going to the ER. And different people get drunk in different ways. One person I know who has a drinking problem usually just sleeps throughout every party, for instance. It's not healthy, but it doesn't cause a problem.\n\nIt sounds like OP and her husband think SIL exaggerates her drinking and are using a one-time ER thing to justify cutting her off.", "Dude, I don't even drink, like at all, I don't like alcohol.
