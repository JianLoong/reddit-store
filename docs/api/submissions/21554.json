He continued doing it all night Every time she said something horrible and went off in a tangent. And it worked! She got the message loud and clear and even laughs about it. So maybe enjoy this idea to use water pistols every time she has a drink in her hand to knock it over. Give several people one and use it to retrain her behaviour.

NTA...not only because your house/your rules, but also because if someone DOES get seriously hurt, you're opening yourself up to a lawsuit.

If you didn\u2019t like her at least a little bit, it would actually be the opposite. You\u2019d let her continue to make a fool of herself in front of everyone and drink her way into an early grave.
