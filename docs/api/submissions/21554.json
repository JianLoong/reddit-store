She shouldn\u2019t have to babysit a grown ass adult.", ">But is this the hill you want to die on?\n\nI think it's the hill they don't want sister to literally die on.", "It won't work.  Like you said, they won't go until they are ready and stuff like that does not work.", "Might? SIL has an alcohol problem. She *will* be drinking if she comes.", " If they are a danger to themselves or others while intoxicated then a firm stance is needed. Everyone else trying to convince you otherwise are enablers.", "Yeah, after the, its unfair she isnt invited, a fitting retort could have been, no worries, you can stay away with her.", "OP isn\u2019t trying to force SIL to get help, she just can\u2019t be a home insurance liability. She isn\u2019t even pretending to say that SIL can\u2019t come back until she\u2019s been sober for x amount of time, it\u2019s just while she\u2019s at their house", "I very rarely drink and when I do it\u2019s 2 at the most. I can still be first up to dance or sing and always have a great time.", "You can consider whatever you want as a drinking problem (btw, if drinking a glass at lunch/dinner everyday is having a drinking problem than 90% or so of adults in Portugal have a drinking problem).\n\nYou're not an alcoholic if drinking or not drinking doesn't have an impact in your day to day, if you're not dependent on alcohol.\n\nAgain, not having a healthy consumption and having a problem are two different things. I'm not eating healthy when I go to Burger King. I don't have a dependency on Burger King nor a fast food problem. I may get health problems from ingesting, which is different."]}
