Are they maybe feeling you out on permanently moving into your basement in the future? Seems like they are trying to establish authority in your house.", "NTA You're not a hotel, you provided them an adequate room and bed. Why does she want that particuliar room?\n\nConsidering what you're saying about her previous visits maybe she's just looking for an excuse to be difficult and not come back.", "NTA.  Most parents would not be like this you know.  My parents would be trying to figure out how they could stay in the basement so as to not inconvenience my kids and family.  You cannot let her have the room she wants from now on.  She needs to suck it up when she is a guest in your house.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is pouting.\n\nNot spending time with her is not the punishment she thinks it is.\n\nI would welcome not spending time with your pouting mother.", "NTA. That's weird and entitled to demand when you're a guest in anyone's home. I can't help but wonder if there was something more to it that your mother failed to communicate, because it just seems like such an oddly unimportant hill to die on, on your mother's part.", "They haven\u2019t been back to visit since last year and have no plans to. While I have no problem standing by my decision I\u2019m not sticking kids in the middle. They\u2019re old enough they can see and make judgements on their own.", "Nah. Young 70. They still tent camp on air mattress. There is only two bathrooms in the whole house. The only thing that makes sense is they wanted basement one to themselves.", "NTA and enjoy not having to host your mum. Your kids will fly the coop all too soon and deserve to enjoy their own rooms while they're studying.  Once the eldest has their own place maybe you can offer his room to mum again.", "Parents have spent most of your life telling you what to do and expecting you to obey without any comment. Now you as an adult are telling your Mom no and she doesn\u2019t like that she is no longer able to tell you what to do and have you obey.

Grandma can just take the room offered and suck it up.", "That\u2019s why grandma is ticked she isn\u2019t in control and she takes it or leaves it.

She knew damn well that it was unreasonable to ask, that the youngest offering their room was perfectly  reasonable and she just wanted to assert dominance, that's why she let her husband do it.\n\n\nI can't believe she forced your sister out of her own house because she put her needs before everyone else. She should be ashamed of herself.\n\nRemember you can't choose family, but you can choose who is worth keeping in your life.", "NTA. They were able to stay in your house for free. You don\u2019t complain about the room unless there is a physical reason you can\u2019t stay there", "NTA. They're willing to go LC because you won't let them dictate to you in your own house", "Basement = more stairs than main level. This argument holds no water.", "Hell no! She\u2019s lost guest privileges. She can stay at a hotel or not visit at all honestly.", "Have your parents always been entitled pricks or is this something new? NTA , please don't invite them again", "NTA. She is upset that you said no to her. She is willing to cut you and her grandchildren off because you said no to her. You are losing nothing by letting her be offended right out of your lives. Don\u2019t reach out. See how long it takes her to do it. If she never does, you will know what was most important to her in all the world.", "I always thought that when you stayed at another person's house, you accepted whatever accommodation was offered . . .

Also yeah your kids exams are important", "NTA - your mum\u2019s the textbook definition of a narcissist"]}
