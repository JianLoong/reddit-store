No one likes to be tased on the subway. \nOne of my friends got a sore face when he smiled at a woman walking past her in a bar, it was just a reflex, but her boyfriend saw it and thought it was something else. \nI have a resting angry face so I get told to smile by random men more than I get in trouble for smiling.", "People are weird!
