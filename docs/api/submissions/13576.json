Pretty sure I've ridden a thousand elevators, maybe more. I don't greet others when I get on, others don't greet me when they get on.

They aren't parties, bars, or potlucks. They're just a mode of transport. She sounds like she just needed to snap at someone because of stress and you were handy.", "Eh, I can't say I say hello to every person I meet on a lift - nor do I expect them to do so to me!  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA and she\u2019s just someone who thinks too highly of herself. Like you said, she didn\u2019t greet you either making her a hypocrite.", "Lol NTA at all. I don't know what that person's deal was. It's not normal at all to talk to people in elevators. \n\nIf she wanted to have a conversation so badly, why didn't she start one?", "She rebuked a complete stranger over a triviality, and you're the one who needs to learn manners?

If I see someone in the elevator in my building regularly, that's one thing, but a complete stranger in a public elevator somewhere? Yeah, no.", "Nta, did she expect you to bow or something? Let her have her bad day somewhere else.", "Aaw NTA, that person should eat her own dog food. \n\nIn the future, it doesn't hurt to give a smile, nod, or quiet \"good morning\" but it's a-ok just to stay focused on your own things when in the proximity of a stranger.", "NTA. You're not obligated to tell anyone hello. Sure, the 'polite' thing would be to greet the person you're sharing an elevator with but I cannot imagine telling someone off for not doing so. She's a massive AH. Maybe your mom god forbid passed away earlier and you are reeling. Like the audacity lol.", "NTA and you probably would have been labeled a creep if you spoke to a different person. It\u2019s a no win", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to greet or smile at random stranger.

The proper response is to ignore and avoid.", "Assuming you're in the US or Canada, NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've heard of some kind of greetings standard in places like doctor's waiting rooms in Germany, but I've never seen it.

NTA.", "NTA...You're not obligated to greet people on elevators.", "NTA. I thought elevator protocol was to politely ignore anyone else there with you. No talking or looking at others. I ride elevators every day and no one interacts.", "As a frequent elevator goer I was never expected to greet...anyone else riding. I mean if I'm next to the button panel I'll say, \"Hey where ya going\" or something and hit their floor but that's about the extent of my pleasantries.\n\nNTA", "NTA, in fact nowadays its probably smart to avoid contact with people you don't know, screw manners.\n\nGod forbid, you overdo it and someone takes it the wrong way.", "NTA.

No one greets strangers on elevators.", "I have never in my life greeted a stranger when entering an elevator.  Maybe a brief nod if we accidentally make eye contact.

Where I live it's normal to say hello and goodbye to people in elevators. It would feel awkward not to.

I might nod or something if they look at me when someone comes on my elevator but I don't say anything unless they do.
