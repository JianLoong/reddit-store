We reach the scene where the elves are working on Santa\u2019s sled to make it fly because not enough people believe in Santa. My daughter latches on to this and just keeps asking,\u201dIs Santa real?\u201d.  Her mother said yes, but my daughter kept asking me as well. I said, \u201cSanta is a great idea, and a lot of fun, but no he is not real.\u201d\n\nFor some context, I love Christmas, but I didn\u2019t get to celebrate Christmas until I had a family of my own. I was raised in a family whose religion prohibited Christmas. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out and experience all the moments I missed. So we do Christmas as big as we can. All the stereotypical traditions. And for the past five Christmases I\u2019ve passively went along with the Santa idea with my daughter, even though I told my wife that I didn\u2019t like lying to her, and I didn\u2019t see the point in lying about something that would eventually come out no matter what.  I also told my wife that I wouldn\u2019t lie if I was ever asked. Well the moment finally came. She asked me and I said he wasn\u2019t real. \n\nAt first my daughter was fine. My wife gave her some long explanation as to why she is lucky we get her presents. My daughter didn\u2019t really like this explanation and was upset. We both told her that some parents work really hard to convince their kids that Santa exists, and that she shouldn\u2019t try to convince kids otherwise. My wife definitely felt like I should have lied. Eventually my wife asked my daughter if learning that Santa wasn\u2019t real changed how she feels about Christmas, and my daughter said \u201ckinda\u201d. \n\nMy wife thinks I should have lied; that kids believing in Santa is harmless, and that I can\u2019t relate to Christmas from a child\u2019s perspective because I didn\u2019t have those experiences. I think we played along with a tradition for as along as we could, but when my daughter directly asked me, the truth was the better option. I can\u2019t really walk this one back, and we all will have a good holiday, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1700494045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zr09a/aita_for_telling_my_6_year_old_that_santa_isnt/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could (read: should) have deflected answering directly, then had a conversation in your wife in private about when to broach the topic of Santa's existence to your daughter.\n\nKind of a shitty thing to hear your wife tell your daughter \"Yes he's real\" and then you immediately go against that.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nThere isn't any harm in believing in the magic of Santa as a kid. I don't know anyone who is upset they were lied to about it, including my own kids. Santa is a huge part of Christmas for those that believe and you just ruined that part of Christmas for your daughter. When mine got old enough to really start questioning it (around age 10) I told them that he's not really real but the magic surrounding the belief is...as in Christmas magic, the kindness, the giving, being with friends and family, the whole feeling a lot of us get around Christmas. That's what Santa is. \r  \n\r  \nThe big AH part is how you directly contradicted your wife in front of your daughter and told your daughter to lie to her friends. All you had to do was go along with it and have a discussion with your wife about it in private, not undermine her in front of your own kid. Now your 6 year old has to listen to her friends getting excited about Santa, and even though you told her not to tell anyone (aka lie to them), she'll probably slip because she's so young. So while you were so worried about lying to her, you told her to lie to others. Do you see the issue with this?", "I wasn't remotely upset with my parents for \"lying\" to me when I found out he wasn't real. I'm SO glad I had the magic of Santa's to believe in until I was 7/8 years old. It really was magical, coming down stairs to find the carrots and cookies gone. I'm thankful my parents went along with that. I also had the brains to not take it personally or feel betrayed - I understood they weren't LYING as such, they were doing it for my benefit.\n\nReally hate this trend of \"we shouldn't lie to our children\" about absolutely EVERYTHING. It's okay to lie sometimes. I highly doubt the myth of Santa's Claus is going to cause lifelong trust issues.", "You've been playing along with the Santa charade for five years, and when your daughter finally asks, you decide to drop the truth bomb in the middle of Elf? Smooth move. Your wife has a point; you could've kept the magic alive a bit longer. Your rigid stance about not lying might be commendable, but it's Christmas, man! You could've handled it more tactfully, maybe discussed it with your wife beforehand. Now your daughter's Christmas spirit is \"kinda\" ruined, and it's on you. My kids are still firm believers in Santa Claus. They're at that age where the excitement is contagious, and I'll be damned if I'm the one to tell them the truth. It's all about the magic of the season. Yeah, you might have been technically honest, but you're also the guy who killed Santa for his 6-year-old. You're definitely the Grinch in this Christmas tale.", "YTA. 6 years old is still young enough to believe. You kind of ruined it for her b/c I'm guessing some if not most of her friends who celebrate Christmas still believe in Santa. Your wife telling her \"Yes\" was a clear signal.", "Are you sure you will ALL have a good holiday? Based on how your daughter answered your wife's question I think it is a safe bet that at least one of you won't, possibly two. I somehow doubt you love Christmas as much as you claim if you were willing to take the chance that everyone was still going to have a good holiday after revealing this. YTA\n\nEDIT: was the we in the we will all still have a good holiday just you trying to use the Royal We?", "YTA for doing this unilaterally. It isn't even *your* holiday tradition you've fucked with. And when you asked if this changed the way your 6-year-old felt about Christmas and she said \"kinda\"? She meant \"yes\". Boooooo.", "YTA the kid was allowed 2 holidays that they\u2019d probably actually remember and you felt the need to ruin the joy of Christmas for the rest of their life. This isnt just asshole material, this is shit parent material. You\u2019re not talking to some rational adult that needs to grow up, youre left to ensure a child can grow up as a child in this heartless, cruel, fucked up world. You being physically incapable of playing along says something about you.", "YTA. Kinda sounds like you hate Christmas and wanted to make sure your child does too.", "I have said this before. The way this should have been handled is the \u201cSanta is more of a feeling than an actual person. He WAS an actual person, way back when, and when he passed, people tried to keep the feeling alive.\u201d Followed up with, \u201cWhen you stop believing, you stop getting Santa presents. And now that you\u2019re on the side of knowing, you get to help MAKE the magic of Christmas. And as long as you still believe in the \u201cmagic\u201d you will still get Santa gifts\u201d. But, alas, the ship has sailed. You should have, could have but you didn\u2019t talk to your wife first, and that makes YTA.", "YTA\n\nAnd I adore how you are dictating how the future is going to go;\n\n>we all will have a good holiday\n\nYou hope you will, but who knows for sure.", "Yeah, YTA. There really is zero harm in letting children believe in Santa. I'm not really sure why this was a hill you needed to die on, but here we are.", "YTA. Do you kick Santa Clauses collecting for charity, also?", "I was never told as a child he wasn't real even in to my teens I had a sibling 5 yes younger it was carried on for her even when I left home the first yr I still got a sack from him! Then I had my own son and it changed. Why would you steal a little of their innocence and the magic from them just because u didn't have it?\nMy older ones know 14, 16 they still receive it all and help keep the magic alive for the younger ones. Only reason I caved and said to them is they were teens and faced with discussions daily at school even then they still felt a small but of magic they said they felt though they knew there was always the magical what if. That made me sad I did on some level regret telling them. Though now they are the magic and they love that more, they help but wrap and palace the pressies and also do the elf. To me YTA she's so small still and magic brings more wonder and opens their minds to everything you took that at a time it's harder for them to understand. That was cruel... You also should have talked it out with your wife too", "YTA - Just because you did not get to celebrate Christmas as a kid does not mean you can ruin it for your daughter. You should have followed your wife's lead.", "YTA you contradicted your wife in front of your child when you should be on the same page even if you disagree. Your opinion doesn't overrule your wife's opinion. Good luck for that good holiday you're so certain of", "YTA, would it have killed you to lie? FFS, she's 6!", "When my 7 yo son asked asked I responded with \u2018I will tell you the truth if you really want to know.\u2019\n\nHe did not really want to know.", "YTA", "Unpopular opinion: NTA. At 6, she's in school, there are kids from different religions, older kids who are too old to still believe - she was going to hear it anywy, better she hear it from you than from kids on the plaground telling her that her parents are liars.", "NAH.\n\nYour kid asked because she could smell something was amiss. She didn't buy what Mom was selling. You were upfront. This momentary sadness of a little bit of magic disappearing sucks for everyone, but your kid knows that you're gonna be honest with her and see her as someone who deserves the truth even if it sucks.\n\nThat's some real magic Dad. You did good.", "NTA- I think it's always a bad idea to lie to your children, especially since Santa is a manipulation tactic at best and getting off on your kids naivete and trust to believe something as stupid as Santa is real at worst. In the simplest form, telling your kids Santa is real is a betrayal of their trust.", "NAH, but you did not handle this well. It sounds like your daughter was seeking reassurance, but you weren\u2019t ready to give it to her because you have conceptualized Santa as a lie. Santa is as real as Christmas is real. Both are non-tangible concepts that we recognize through tradition. When a child is young, they may think of Santa as being a real person, and they eventually grow into understanding he is a piece of folklore affiliated with the Christmas tradition. Santa is not unique in this, children often think that cartoons, characters in television shows, and mythical figures are also real. Eventually they figure out that the Purple Wiggle is just a regular person playing a silly character on TV, just as they figure out their school teacher is a complete person with a complete personality outside of the classroom. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter wasn\u2019t ready for that transition, but you chose to make it for her because of your own personal feelings regarding the holiday and its associated traditions. This is a conversation you should have had with your spouse before telling her about Santa in the first place. If you were going to present him as a lie, you should have resolved that with her beforehand, where now you have put your family in the position of \u201cmommy is a liar and she lies to you\u201d and are stuck doing damage control.", "\"Santa exists in the hearts and minds of everyone that believes in him and as long as YOU believe then he is real to you\" This was basically my answer when my kid asked me. As you can see I didn't lie and say he was real but I answered in a way that let's my child still believe and enjoy the \"magic of Christmas\" a little longer. And how much do you really enjoy Christmas if you are willing to destroy the magic of it for a 6 year old child? YTA", "YTA (mildly) because you said Santa wasn't real, when moments ago your wife said he was real. It's not about Santa at all, but how you both gave her a different answer. You should have go along with your wife's answer. And then together consider it when should you tell her that he isn't real. Now you're making your wife look like a liar to your kid.", "NTA, Lying about Santa isn\u2019t a requirement to make Christmas fun and plenty of kids have negative reactions when they inevitably find out which imo means it\u2019s better not to lie in the first place, but she\u2019ll still have the excitement of family and presents without believing in Santa. Christmas isn\u2019t ruined.", "YTA", "I don't think parents should tell their kids that Santa is real. My parents didn't tell us he was real, but we played the \"Santa game\" every year. We put up stockings, and left out cookies and milk, etc. It was a lot of fun. Kids get caught up in the spirit no matter what; they don't need to think he's real.", "NTA\n\nI agree with you. If asked point blank, it\u2019s okay (maybe even preferable) to tell the truth. It\u2019s one thing to foster a fun belief in a little kid but when they ASK you for information, you should give it to them, in an age-appropriate way. Asking means they are seeking an answer to a question they are wondering about or doubting, and they are trusting you to give it to them. \n\nAlso, at 6, only about 65% of kids believe in Santa. So it\u2019s not exactly shockingly early for her to be told.", "\u2018I love Christmas\u2019\u2013 proceeds to ruin Christmas for his 5 yo daughter. YTA.", "Nta. She asked because she had doubts and was looking to her parents for guidance. My feeling is that if they ask the question they deserve an honest answer.", "NTA I think once kids start questioning Santa, that's the time to tell them the truth.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know why parents think it is ok to lie to their children. Your child asked a question, you gave an honest answer. This \"You can not relate to Christmas ... \" is BS. Not all parents lie to their children about Santa, we never did. There are lots and lots of wonderful things in this world to marvel about, there is no need to invent men in red clothing.", "YTA if you were waiting for this moment, as you imply you were with \u201cthe moment finally came\u201d, then you should have had something better to tell her.", "NTA.  As a kid, for some reason, I was skeptical and never believed in Santa.  If the kid wants THE TRUTH, you tell them the truth.  Yes, you can couch it in a kind way, of course (and you did!) but you don't lie.  My kid was TERRIFIED of Santa for some reason.  No idea why.  At almost 2, she was crying about \"He's going to get me\" and was scared that it was Santa.  So I told her Santa wasn't real.  I told her that other kids believed and not to tell them the truth, but I wasn't going to lie to my kid for no reason.", "Nta. I grew up believing in Santas (multiples ones, icelandic cultured believes in 13 different Santas who are brothers, and we also learn about their parents) but I am firm in my belive that as soon as children start doubting themselves, parents should come clean. Your daughter asked, so that's exactly when you should have told her. Don't insist on lying when they come and ask for honest answers.", "YTA.\nAnyone who tells a kid that something magical that they believe in isn\u2019t real, when that something is doing NO HARM, is TA.\n\nYou could have just asked \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d - no lies told, no destruction of joy. But also bs on the never have and never will lie to my child.", "NTA. If the kid is old enough to ask, then the kid is old enough to hear an honest answer.", "YTA - I grew up JW and was I the kid that told all the other kids that Santa wasn\u2019t real in 4th grade, so I come from a similar background as you.  This is only my experience, but I was sad that I didn\u2019t get to experience \u201cthe magic\u201d of Christmas as a kid, and believing in Santa is part of that.  As an adult, I put a lot of effort into making Christmas magical for my kids. I believe that Santa, while not a real person, is brought to life by the parents and grandparents and siblings and aunts and uncles who *make him real* for the little kids in their lives. \n\nIt\u2019s not exactly the same thing, but I remember my dad telling me mermaids weren\u2019t real when I confessed that I was excited to maybe see a mermaid when I saw the ocean the first time (I was 8 and the Little mermaid was huge). I was so devastated with the news and I still vividly remember it.  But,  it was just a regular Wednesday to my dad and I doubt he even remembers that.  \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but it will likely be something that your daughter remembers about you.", "NTA \n\nSome of us end up feeling like our whole family is lying to us for their own amusement. I felt made fun of and humiliated because I directly asked and was lied to over and over again. \n\nAlways be honest with your child as much as you can.", "YTA.\n\nYou just decided that Santa, who you had been fine with up until now, wasn't something to lie about. That's not ok. You were fine with and then just unilaterally decided to tell your daughter something would only be painful for her to hear.\n\nYou can't walk it back, but you can, and absolutely should, apologize for what you said to her.", "No, and hopefully you told him Jesus isn't real either. Start early before the christians warp his brain.", "YTA. Not for what you told your daughter, but for not being on the same page about it with your wife. Either you both push for Santa, or you both tell the truth. You need to work as a unit and this wasn\u2019t it.", "You\u2019re an idiot. YTA big time. When Santa was ruined for me when I was a kid, I was devastated and Christmas was never the same again. Shame on you.", "YTA. I'm genuinely quite stunned at the number of posters replying to support you for ruining your daughter's Christmas. \ud83d\ude06", "Yes, yes you are. You are definitely the asshole.", "YTA When mom said yes and dad says no, dad makes mom out to be a liar (which is true but not the kind of relationship you should be *creating*). You did this INFRONT of your daughter. Tha it's not okay.\n\nSanta is an innocent lie that gives children hope, magic, mystery, and anticipation in their lives and you ruined that because why? You think its a pointless lie? Its not pointless! Especially not to a child! Why do you think the legend of Santa was invented?", "YTA. If you were really concerned about to lying to your daughter you should've spoken to your wife in private first and reached some sort of agreement rather than directly contradicting her in front of your daughter.\n\nMillions of kids grew up believing in Santa/the Easter bunny/tooth fairy and they all turned out fine.", "YTA. \n\nShe's *six*. Still very much young enough to believe in Santa and all the magic that comes with Christmas, but you've stolen that from her. Why? Seriously... why? \n\nBecause you didn't get Christmas growing up so you figured she didn't deserve it either? \n\nWhat horrible thing would have happened if you had told her Santa was real? She'd enjoy a few more innocent years of magic? \n\nYou suck.", "YTA. Really because I remember the thrill of going to bed as a kid and genuinely believing santa was going to show up. And then proven right when I got downstairs, presents magically appeared under tree, and there were crumbs where the mince pie had been left. Sometimes fiction is better than reality, especially to a 6 year old.", "Soft YTA. I understand that you had no real reference or ties to Santa and the holiday spirit previously. You even went out of your way to make the Christmas holiday over the top for your child due to your upbringing. However, Santa is not just some mythical being. The spirit of Christmas is what Santa embodies. Kind of a jerk thing to do to your own daughter. It is also a crappy thing to do to your partner by undermining what she just told your daughter. That is a conversation to have with your partner in private and away from the kiddo. Please work on that. Because Santa will not be the last thing your daughter asks you about.", "NAH.\n\nThough you and your wife really should have had this conversation before you had a kid so you'd be on the same page lol.\n\nMy fiancee and I are both agreed that we won't pretend Santa exists and let our son know gifts come from us but that Santa is a fun character to love and enjoy just like if you went to Disney and saw Jasmine or Aladdin", "NTA, Always answer direct questions with honesty. Your daughter will trust you.", "YTA, I agree with the other commenter. It\u2019s not that you told your daughter. Kids find out and start asking questions at different times. It was the instant flip from what your wife said and steamrolling her wishes. You guys should have gotten together and decided together from there. You guys should try to have a unified front, instead of making your wife a lier in front of your daughter.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve never understood the making up mascots for holidays schtick. \n\nYou want a real magical Christmas, that PEOPLE being kind to one another.  Not because they want gifts but because it\u2019s the humane thing to do.\n\nAs parents your job is to prepare children and on the western world we set ourselves back several paces by weaving these cute falsehoods.", "NTA, at all. Lying to your kids is always a terrible idea. Thank goodness your daughter has at least one parent she can trust.", "Going against the grain to say NTA with ESH overtones. The fact that she keeps asking over and over if Santa is real tells me someone (probably an older kid with a chip on their shoulder) already told her. She wouldn't have kept asking unless she already had serious doubts.\n\n>My wife gave her some long explanation as to why she is lucky we get her presents.\n\nWhy is your wife telling your daughter she's lucky to get presents? If your family celebrates Christmas, kids should get presents. There shouldn't be luck or behavior involved.\n\nI think you and your wife kinda jointly screwed this up. Sounds like you both panicked and didn't communicate. A better approach would have been to pause the movie for a snack break while you and your wife had a brief talk about it.", "I think any YTA responses are nuts.\n\nI always found it weird that parents lie to their kids about this. Theyre just going to be more upset as time goes on and they eventually learn.", "NTA, my eldest (16) worked it out years ago through watching movies, he asked- I let him know \n\nMy 8 year old has been asking questions about Santa in Australia, and Santa in Belgium (where his dad is from)\n\nHe\u2019s asking questions, we\u2019re googling them as they come with the history of Santa and will come to the conclusion it\u2019s a great concept, worldwide there\u2019s different approaches \n\nDifferent approaches for every family, some deal with it when Bob breaks the news on the monkey bars at school\n\nSome kids figure it out though movies\n\nIn my circumstance, I\u2019m confident I\u2019m going to learn the history of Santa through the history of no less than a dozen countries for my son to make a conclusion, and that\u2019s all good too \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA - Christmas can still be magical without Santa. I figured out Santa wasn\u2019t real when I was 4 (my mum wasn\u2019t happy about it as she really wanted to do the whole milk/pie, reindeer carrot thing). \n\nGuess what? It didn\u2019t ruin Christmas at all! Instead I got to help my dad hand stuff out to homeless, help others and help pick out \u201cSanta gifts\u201d for relatives that still believed.\n\nTry to explain to your daughter that Santa is not necessarily a lie..  teach her the whole point of Santa is to be unselfish (giving a gift labelled from Santa so you don\u2019t get the credit for it or doing a good deed without expecting anything in return), empathetic behaviour (point out 2-3 examples of her showing empathy & consideration of others feelings, good deeds, etc) and tell her her heart is so big now she\u2019s ready to become a Santa.\n\nYou can get her to choose someone she\u2019d like to help out (bake for, get a small gift, help shovel snow off driveway when old enough, etc) - could be a relative, neighbour, family friend? and explain what Christmas Spirit means", "While at 6 years old, it's possible to figure it out yourself. \n\nI think telling a 6 year old is cruel, you're alienating her from her peers. She has a dark secret and they all get to believe in the magic or she can chose to ruin it for them too. \n\n Also, this isn't about you, it's about her, so YTA.", "NTA. The concept of Santa is stupid. I find it weird that people actually believe in it. As a kid I didn\u2019t have to be told it was fake. How is a man delivering presents all over the world in a single night & how is he getting in  our apartment when we don\u2019t even have a chimney? \n\nI once saw someone on this sub say that they believed in Santa till they were 11. I was extremely confused.", "NTA. Lying to your children bc it's tradition is messed up.  She asked you a question and you gave her the honest answer. Yes, you should have talked it through with your wife first, but is it more important for your child to believe in magic or to know she can trust you to be honest? \n\n\n\nPersonally, finding out Santa/the tooth fairy/ whatever weren't really really shook me, bc it felt like my entire family was lying to me for their own amusement. I would have enjoyed Christmas just as much if I knew exactly who my presents came from. The magic wasn't a fat old guy breaking into my house to leave me presents he knew I wanted bc he'd been spying on me. The magic was family and friends and decorations and food. \n\n\nAlso, I had a hard time distinguishing between deception and faith, so I decided god was made up as well and started questioning everything when we went to church. I couldn't understand why my family decided to keep up this lie as if it were fact when they'd caved and admitted everything else was myths and fantasies. It was ... not good.", "YTA. I believed in Santa until I was 18. When my dad asked me if I knew he wasn\u2019t real, it stung but I could handle it. For a 6 year old child, finding out like this is bound to be traumatic. You\u2019ve ruined Christmas for your daughter and probably your wife too and I hope you come to realize that.", "nta. honesty is important in parenting and it's commendable that you didn't want to continue the santa claus charade. it's understandable that your daughter was upset at first but it's also important for her to learn the truth. kids grow up eventually and being honest about santa can help them develop critical thinking skills. enjoy your holiday season with your family!", "YTA for how you went about it - and that this is something that you and your wife should have discussed and agreed upon together. You contradicted and undermined her.", "NTA. I think you and your wife should have had an agreement to fall back on prior to the question. But, its not like we get a do over because we didn't actually have a plan for this. I think that at her age, the illusion likely is starting to fade anyway? I figure that when a kid reaches first grade they will meet other children who don't believe? And because I work with kids, I know that some of them think quite linearly and they seek information to relive fear and doubt *sometimes.*\n\nAt any rate, just for kicks, I did an informal survey and this is what I read: *Broken down, the  research showed that 85 percent of four-year-olds believed wholeheartedly, while 65 percent of six-year-olds and only 25 percent of eight-year-olds were still down with Jolly Old Saint Nicholas. In terms of Santa's believe-o-meter, three- and four-year-olds generate the most juice, because that's when they first start to understand the magic of Santa. By age eight, kids begin to acknowledge the unlikeliness of one man travelling the world in a single night.*\n\nThe average age where the most children have lost that belief system in the U.S. is supposed to be 8-years-old. And children who don't have older siblings are likely to stop believing earlier.\n\nTBF, I can't criticize you because I find myself wanting my kids to think for themselves as much as I want them to enjoy the magic of the holiday season. And so, all I would have done was spoken to my spouse about it privately and told him, 'I think its time because she's asking. That means she's ready for more information.'", "NTA - IMHO, if they are old enough to ask, they are old enough to know.   Not believing Santa is real does not mean you cannot still do all the fun Santa things.   \n\nMy children are all in their 20s.   I told them about Santa, but I did not go way over the top - no hoof prints in the snow, no sleigh bells outside their windows, no you must be good or else.

I come from a culture where we celebrate Christmas but absolutely no child thinks that Santa is real. It didn\u2019t ruin my childhood. Christmas was always incredibly exciting. We knew the gifts were from our family and it was still exciting. \n\nMy kids always knew that Santa was pretend and that it was like a game everyone plays together, even the grownups, to pretend he\u2019s real. \n\nOn the other hand, my husband does come from a \u201cSanta is real\u201d culture and in his family there are stories of children feeling deeply betrayed when they find out the truth.

You really should\u2019ve just said yes and moved on. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve lied to your child about other things before. But instead you chose to make her sad. She\u2019s 6 dude. You should\u2019ve let her experience the magic of Christmas for a couple more years.", "Yta for spoiling Xmas for a 6 year old. Out of spite no less. And going against your wife's wishes.

When I got home I told my mom what had happened and asked her about it and she told me that that girl was just fibbing to me and Santa is real. But me being a curious 6-year-old and having conflicting huge news thrown at me I didn't know what to believe. So I stayed up all night until I heard gifts being put under the tree I peaked around the door and seen my mom out there and I remember I was so angry and hurt and sad and let down and I ran to the living room and started punching my mom saying you're a liar I knew it why didn't you just tell me the truth. She tried telling me that she is just helping Santa that he's so busy he drops the gifts off and then she puts them under the tree for him and I'm like no just tell me the truth and then she was finally honest with me and I accepted it.

We reach the scene where the elves are working on Santa\u2019s sled to make it fly because not enough people believe in Santa. My daughter latches on to this and just keeps asking,\u201dIs Santa real?\u201d.  Her mother said yes, but my daughter kept asking me as well. I said, \u201cSanta is a great idea, and a lot of fun, but no he is not real.\u201d\n\nFor some context, I love Christmas, but I didn\u2019t get to celebrate Christmas until I had a family of my own. I was raised in a family whose religion prohibited Christmas. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out and experience all the moments I missed. So we do Christmas as big as we can. All the stereotypical traditions. And for the past five Christmases I\u2019ve passively went along with the Santa idea with my daughter, even though I told my wife that I didn\u2019t like lying to her, and I didn\u2019t see the point in lying about something that would eventually come out no matter what.  I also told my wife that I wouldn\u2019t lie if I was ever asked. Well the moment finally came. She asked me and I said he wasn\u2019t real. \n\nAt first my daughter was fine. My wife gave her some long explanation as to why she is lucky we get her presents. My daughter didn\u2019t really like this explanation and was upset. We both told her that some parents work really hard to convince their kids that Santa exists, and that she shouldn\u2019t try to convince kids otherwise. My wife definitely felt like I should have lied. Eventually my wife asked my daughter if learning that Santa wasn\u2019t real changed how she feels about Christmas, and my daughter said \u201ckinda\u201d. \n\nMy wife thinks I should have lied; that kids believing in Santa is harmless, and that I can\u2019t relate to Christmas from a child\u2019s perspective because I didn\u2019t have those experiences. I think we played along with a tradition for as along as we could, but when my daughter directly asked me, the truth was the better option. I can\u2019t really walk this one back, and we all will have a good holiday, but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
