We reach the scene where the elves are working on Santa\u2019s sled to make it fly because not enough people believe in Santa. My daughter latches on to this and just keeps asking,\u201dIs Santa real?\u201d.  Her mother said yes, but my daughter kept asking me as well. I said, \u201cSanta is a great idea, and a lot of fun, but no he is not real.\u201d\n\nFor some context, I love Christmas, but I didn\u2019t get to celebrate Christmas until I had a family of my own. I was raised in a family whose religion prohibited Christmas. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out and experience all the moments I missed. So we do Christmas as big as we can. All the stereotypical traditions. And for the past five Christmases I\u2019ve passively went along with the Santa idea with my daughter, even though I told my wife that I didn\u2019t like lying to her, and I didn\u2019t see the point in lying about something that would eventually come out no matter what.  I also told my wife that I wouldn\u2019t lie if I was ever asked. Well the moment finally came. She asked me and I said he wasn\u2019t real. \n\nAt first my daughter was fine. My wife gave her some long explanation as to why she is lucky we get her presents. My daughter didn\u2019t really like this explanation and was upset. We both told her that some parents work really hard to convince their kids that Santa exists, and that she shouldn\u2019t try to convince kids otherwise. My wife definitely felt like I should have lied. Eventually my wife asked my daughter if learning that Santa wasn\u2019t real changed how she feels about Christmas, and my daughter said \u201ckinda\u201d. \n\nMy wife thinks I should have lied; that kids believing in Santa is harmless, and that I can\u2019t relate to Christmas from a child\u2019s perspective because I didn\u2019t have those experiences. I think we played along with a tradition for as along as we could, but when my daughter directly asked me, the truth was the better option. I can\u2019t really walk this one back, and we all will have a good holiday, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1700494045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zr09a/aita_for_telling_my_6_year_old_that_santa_isnt/", "score": 1625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could (read: should) have deflected answering directly, then had a conversation in your wife in private about when to broach the topic of Santa's existence to your daughter.\n\nKind of a shitty thing to hear your wife tell your daughter \"Yes he's real\" and then you immediately go against that.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nThere isn't any harm in believing in the magic of Santa as a kid. I don't know anyone who is upset they were lied to about it, including my own kids. Santa is a huge part of Christmas for those that believe and you just ruined that part of Christmas for your daughter. When mine got old enough to really start questioning it (around age 10) I told them that he's not really real but the magic surrounding the belief is...as in Christmas magic, the kindness, the giving, being with friends and family, the whole feeling a lot of us get around Christmas. That's what Santa is. \r  \n\r  \nThe big AH part is how you directly contradicted your wife in front of your daughter and told your daughter to lie to her friends. All you had to do was go along with it and have a discussion with your wife about it in private, not undermine her in front of your own kid. Now your 6 year old has to listen to her friends getting excited about Santa, and even though you told her not to tell anyone (aka lie to them), she'll probably slip because she's so young. So while you were so worried about lying to her, you told her to lie to others. Do you see the issue with this?", "I wasn't remotely upset with my parents for \"lying\" to me when I found out he wasn't real. I'm SO glad I had the magic of Santa to believe in until I was 7/8 years old. It really was magical, coming down stairs to find the carrots and cookies gone. I'm thankful my parents went along with that. I also had the brains to not take it personally or feel betrayed - I understood they weren't LYING as such, they were doing it for my benefit.\n\nReally hate this trend of \"we shouldn't lie to our children\" about absolutely EVERYTHING. It's okay to lie sometimes. I highly doubt the myth of Santa Claus is going to cause lifelong trust issues.", "You've been playing along with the Santa charade for five years, and when your daughter finally asks, you decide to drop the truth bomb in the middle of Elf? Smooth move. Your wife has a point; you could've kept the magic alive a bit longer. Your rigid stance about not lying might be commendable, but it's Christmas, man! You could've handled it more tactfully, maybe discussed it with your wife beforehand. Now your daughter's Christmas spirit is \"kinda\" ruined, and it's on you. My kids are still firm believers in Santa Claus. They're at that age where the excitement is contagious, and I'll be damned if I'm the one to tell them the truth. It's all about the magic of the season. Yeah, you might have been technically honest, but you're also the guy who killed Santa for his 6-year-old. You're definitely the Grinch in this Christmas tale.", "YTA. 6 years old is still young enough to believe. You kind of ruined it for her b/c I'm guessing some if not most of her friends who celebrate Christmas still believe in Santa. Your wife telling her \"Yes\" was a clear signal.", "Are you sure you will ALL have a good holiday? Based on how your daughter answered your wife's question I think it is a safe bet that at least one of you won't, possibly two. I somehow doubt you love Christmas as much as you claim if you were willing to take the chance that everyone was still going to have a good holiday after revealing this. YTA\n\nEDIT: was the we in the we will all still have a good holiday just you trying to use the Royal We?", "YTA for doing this unilaterally. It isn't even *your* holiday tradition you've fucked with. And when you asked if this changed the way your 6-year-old felt about Christmas and she said \"kinda\"? She meant \"yes\". Boooooo.", "YTA the kid was allowed 2 holidays that they\u2019d probably actually remember and you felt the need to ruin the joy of Christmas for the rest of their life. This isnt just asshole material, this is shit parent material. You\u2019re not talking to some rational adult that needs to grow up, youre left to ensure a child can grow up as a child in this heartless, cruel, fucked up world. You being physically incapable of playing along says something about you.", "YTA. Kinda sounds like you hate Christmas and wanted to make sure your child does too.", "I have said this before. The way this should have been handled is the \u201cSanta is more of a feeling than an actual person. He WAS an actual person, way back when, and when he passed, people tried to keep the feeling alive.\u201d Followed up with, \u201cWhen you stop believing, you stop getting Santa presents. And now that you\u2019re on the side of knowing, you get to help MAKE the magic of Christmas. And as long as you still believe in the \u201cmagic\u201d you will still get Santa gifts\u201d. But, alas, the ship has sailed. You should have, could have but you didn\u2019t talk to your wife first, and that makes YTA.", "YTA\n\nAnd I adore how you are dictating how the future is going to go;\n\n>we all will have a good holiday\n\nYou hope you will, but who knows for sure.", "Yeah, YTA. There really is zero harm in letting children believe in Santa. I'm not really sure why this was a hill you needed to die on, but here we are.", "YTA. Do you kick Santa Clauses collecting for charity, also?", "I was never told as a child he wasn't real even in to my teens I had a sibling 5 yes younger it was carried on for her even when I left home the first yr I still got a sack from him! Then I had my own son and it changed. Why would you steal a little of their innocence and the magic from them just because u didn't have it?\nMy older ones know 14, 16 they still receive it all and help keep the magic alive for the younger ones. Only reason I caved and said to them is they were teens and faced with discussions daily at school even then they still felt a small but of magic they said they felt though they knew there was always the magical what if. That made me sad I did on some level regret telling them. Though now they are the magic and they love that more, they help but wrap and palace the pressies and also do the elf. To me YTA she's so small still and magic brings more wonder and opens their minds to everything you took that at a time it's harder for them to understand. That was cruel... You also should have talked it out with your wife too", "YTA - Just because you did not get to celebrate Christmas as a kid does not mean you can ruin it for your daughter. You should have followed your wife's lead.", "YTA you contradicted your wife in front of your child when you should be on the same page even if you disagree. Your opinion doesn't overrule your wife's opinion. Good luck for that good holiday you're so certain of", "YTA, would it have killed you to lie? FFS, she's 6!", "When my 7 yo son asked asked I responded with \u2018I will tell you the truth if you really want to know.\u2019\n\nHe did not really want to know.", "YTA", "Unpopular opinion: NTA. At 6, she's in school, there are kids from different religions, older kids who are too old to still believe - she was going to hear it anywy, better she hear it from you than from kids on the plaground telling her that her parents are liars.", "NAH.\n\nYour kid asked because she could smell something was amiss. She didn't buy what Mom was selling. You were upfront. This momentary sadness of a little bit of magic disappearing sucks for everyone, but your kid knows that you're gonna be honest with her and see her as someone who deserves the truth even if it sucks.\n\nThat's some real magic Dad. You did good.", "NTA- I think it's always a bad idea to lie to your children, especially since Santa is a manipulation tactic at best and getting off on your kids naivete and trust to believe something as stupid as Santa is real at worst. In the simplest form, telling your kids Santa is real is a betrayal of their trust.", "NAH, but you did not handle this well. It sounds like your daughter was seeking reassurance, but you weren\u2019t ready to give it to her because you have conceptualized Santa as a lie. Santa is as real as Christmas is real. Both are non-tangible concepts that we recognize through tradition. When a child is young, they may think of Santa as being a real person, and they eventually grow into understanding he is a piece of folklore affiliated with the Christmas tradition. Santa is not unique in this, children often think that cartoons, characters in television shows, and mythical figures are also real. Eventually they figure out that the Purple Wiggle is just a regular person playing a silly character on TV, just as they figure out their school teacher is a complete person with a complete personality outside of the classroom. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter wasn\u2019t ready for that transition, but you chose to make it for her because of your own personal feelings regarding the holiday and its associated traditions. This is a conversation you should have had with your spouse before telling her about Santa in the first place. If you were going to present him as a lie, you should have resolved that with her beforehand, where now you have put your family in the position of \u201cmommy is a liar and she lies to you\u201d and are stuck doing damage control.", "\"Santa exists in the hearts and minds of everyone that believes in him and as long as YOU believe then he is real to you\" This was basically my answer when my kid asked me. As you can see I didn't lie and say he was real but I answered in a way that let's my child still believe and enjoy the \"magic of Christmas\" a little longer. And how much do you really enjoy Christmas if you are willing to destroy the magic of it for a 6 year old child? YTA", "YTA (mildly) because you said Santa wasn't real, when moments ago your wife said he was real. It's not about Santa at all, but how you both gave her a different answer. You should have go along with your wife's answer. And then together consider it when should you tell her that he isn't real. Now you're making your wife look like a liar to your kid.", "NTA, Lying about Santa isn\u2019t a requirement to make Christmas fun and plenty of kids have negative reactions when they inevitably find out which imo means it\u2019s better not to lie in the first place, but she\u2019ll still have the excitement of family and presents without believing in Santa. Christmas isn\u2019t ruined.", "YTA", "I don't think parents should tell their kids that Santa is real. My parents didn't tell us he was real, but we played the \"Santa game\" every year. We put up stockings, and left out cookies and milk, etc. It was a lot of fun. Kids get caught up in the spirit no matter what; they don't need to think he's real.", "NTA\n\nI agree with you. If asked point blank, it\u2019s okay (maybe even preferable) to tell the truth. It\u2019s one thing to foster a fun belief in a little kid but when they ASK you for information, you should give it to them, in an age-appropriate way. Asking means they are seeking an answer to a question they are wondering about or doubting, and they are trusting you to give it to them. \n\nAlso, at 6, only about 65% of kids believe in Santa. So it\u2019s not exactly shockingly early for her to be told.", "\u2018I love Christmas\u2019\u2013 proceeds to ruin Christmas for his 5 yo daughter. YTA.", "Nta. She asked because she had doubts and was looking to her parents for guidance. My feeling is that if they ask the question they deserve an honest answer.", "NTA I think once kids start questioning Santa, that's the time to tell them the truth.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know why parents think it is ok to lie to their children. Your child asked a question, you gave an honest answer. This \"You can not relate to Christmas ... \" is BS. Not all parents lie to their children about Santa, we never did. There are lots and lots of wonderful things in this world to marvel about, there is no need to invent men in red clothing.", "YTA if you were waiting for this moment, as you imply you were with \u201cthe moment finally came\u201d, then you should have had something better to tell her.", "NTA.  As a kid, for some reason, I was skeptical and never believed in Santa.  If the kid wants THE TRUTH, you tell them the truth.  Yes, you can couch it in a kind way, of course (and you did!) but you don't lie.  My kid was TERRIFIED of Santa for some reason.  No idea why.  At almost 2, she was crying about \"He's going to get me\" and was scared that it was Santa.  So I told her Santa wasn't real.  I told her that other kids believed and not to tell them the truth, but I wasn't going to lie to my kid for no reason.", "Nta. I grew up believing in Santas (multiples ones, icelandic cultured believes in 13 different Santas who are brothers, and we also learn about their parents) but I am firm in my belive that as soon as children start doubting themselves, parents should come clean. Your daughter asked, so that's exactly when you should have told her. Don't insist on lying when they come and ask for honest answers.", "YTA.\nAnyone who tells a kid that something magical that they believe in isn\u2019t real, when that something is doing NO HARM, is TA.\n\nYou could have just asked \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d - no lies told, no destruction of joy. But also bs on the never have and never will lie to my child.", "NTA. If the kid is old enough to ask, then the kid is old enough to hear an honest answer.", "YTA - I grew up JW and was I the kid that told all the other kids that Santa wasn\u2019t real in 4th grade, so I come from a similar background as you.  This is only my experience, but I was sad that I didn\u2019t get to experience \u201cthe magic\u201d of Christmas as a kid, and believing in Santa is part of that.  As an adult, I put a lot of effort into making Christmas magical for my kids. I believe that Santa, while not a real person, is brought to life by the parents and grandparents and siblings and aunts and uncles who *make him real* for the little kids in their lives. \n\nIt\u2019s not exactly the same thing, but I remember my dad telling me mermaids weren\u2019t real when I confessed that I was excited to maybe see a mermaid when I saw the ocean the first time (I was 8 and the Little mermaid was huge). I was so devastated with the news and I still vividly remember it.  But,  it was just a regular Wednesday to my dad and I doubt he even remembers that.  \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but it will likely be something that your daughter remembers about you.", "NTA \n\nSome of us end up feeling like our whole family is lying to us for their own amusement. I felt made fun of and humiliated because I directly asked and was lied to over and over again. \n\nAlways be honest with your child as much as you can.", "YTA.\n\nYou just decided that Santa, who you had been fine with up until now, wasn't something to lie about. That's not ok. You were fine with and then just unilaterally decided to tell your daughter something would only be painful for her to hear.\n\nYou can't walk it back, but you can, and absolutely should, apologize for what you said to her.", "No, and hopefully you told him Jesus isn't real either. Start early before the christians warp his brain.", "YTA. Not for what you told your daughter, but for not being on the same page about it with your wife. Either you both push for Santa, or you both tell the truth. You need to work as a unit and this wasn\u2019t it.", "[deleted]", "YTA. I'm genuinely quite stunned at the number of posters replying to support you for ruining your daughter's Christmas. \ud83d\ude06", "Yes, yes you are. You are definitely the asshole.", "YTA When mom said yes and dad says no, dad makes mom out to be a liar (which is true but not the kind of relationship you should be *creating*). You did this INFRONT of your daughter. Tha it's not okay.\n\nSanta is an innocent lie that gives children hope, magic, mystery, and anticipation in their lives and you ruined that because why? You think its a pointless lie? Its not pointless! Especially not to a child! Why do you think the legend of Santa was invented?", "YTA. If you were really concerned about to lying to your daughter you should've spoken to your wife in private first and reached some sort of agreement rather than directly contradicting her in front of your daughter.\n\nMillions of kids grew up believing in Santa/the Easter bunny/tooth fairy and they all turned out fine.", "YTA. \n\nShe's *six*. Still very much young enough to believe in Santa and all the magic that comes with Christmas, but you've stolen that from her. Why? Seriously... why? \n\nBecause you didn't get Christmas growing up so you figured she didn't deserve it either? \n\nWhat horrible thing would have happened if you had told her Santa was real? She'd enjoy a few more innocent years of magic? \n\nYou suck.", "YTA. Really because I remember the thrill of going to bed as a kid and genuinely believing santa was going to show up. And then proven right when I got downstairs, presents magically appeared under tree, and there were crumbs where the mince pie had been left. Sometimes fiction is better than reality, especially to a 6 year old.", "Soft YTA. I understand that you had no real reference or ties to Santa and the holiday spirit previously. You even went out of your way to make the Christmas holiday over the top for your child due to your upbringing. However, Santa is not just some mythical being. The spirit of Christmas is what Santa embodies. Kind of a jerk thing to do to your own daughter. It is also a crappy thing to do to your partner by undermining what she just told your daughter. That is a conversation to have with your partner in private and away from the kiddo. Please work on that. Because Santa will not be the last thing your daughter asks you about.", "NAH.\n\nThough you and your wife really should have had this conversation before you had a kid so you'd be on the same page lol.\n\nMy fiancee and I are both agreed that we won't pretend Santa exists and let our son know gifts come from us but that Santa is a fun character to love and enjoy just like if you went to Disney and saw Jasmine or Aladdin", "NTA, Always answer direct questions with honesty. Your daughter will trust you.", "YTA, I agree with the other commenter. It\u2019s not that you told your daughter. Kids find out and start asking questions at different times. It was the instant flip from what your wife said and steamrolling her wishes. You guys should have gotten together and decided together from there. You guys should try to have a unified front, instead of making your wife a lier in front of your daughter.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve never understood the making up mascots for holidays schtick. \n\nYou want a real magical Christmas, that PEOPLE being kind to one another.  Not because they want gifts but because it\u2019s the humane thing to do.\n\nAs parents your job is to prepare children and on the western world we set ourselves back several paces by weaving these cute falsehoods.", "NTA, at all. Lying to your kids is always a terrible idea. Thank goodness your daughter has at least one parent she can trust.", "Going against the grain to say NTA with ESH overtones. The fact that she keeps asking over and over if Santa is real tells me someone (probably an older kid with a chip on their shoulder) already told her. She wouldn't have kept asking unless she already had serious doubts.\n\n>My wife gave her some long explanation as to why she is lucky we get her presents.\n\nWhy is your wife telling your daughter she's lucky to get presents? If your family celebrates Christmas, kids should get presents. There shouldn't be luck or behavior involved.\n\nI think you and your wife kinda jointly screwed this up. Sounds like you both panicked and didn't communicate. A better approach would have been to pause the movie for a snack break while you and your wife had a brief talk about it.", "I think any YTA responses are nuts.\n\nI always found it weird that parents lie to their kids about this. Theyre just going to be more upset as time goes on and they eventually learn.", "NTA, my eldest (16) worked it out years ago through watching movies, he asked- I let him know \n\nMy 8 year old has been asking questions about Santa in Australia, and Santa in Belgium (where his dad is from)\n\nHe\u2019s asking questions, we\u2019re googling them as they come with the history of Santa and will come to the conclusion it\u2019s a great concept, worldwide there\u2019s different approaches \n\nDifferent approaches for every family, some deal with it when Bob breaks the news on the monkey bars at school\n\nSome kids figure it out though movies\n\nIn my circumstance, I\u2019m confident I\u2019m going to learn the history of Santa through the history of no less than a dozen countries for my son to make a conclusion, and that\u2019s all good too \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA - Christmas can still be magical without Santa. I figured out Santa wasn\u2019t real when I was 4 (my mum wasn\u2019t happy about it as she really wanted to do the whole milk/pie, reindeer carrot thing). \n\nGuess what? It didn\u2019t ruin Christmas at all! Instead I got to help my dad hand stuff out to homeless, help others and help pick out \u201cSanta gifts\u201d for relatives that still believed.\n\nTry to explain to your daughter that Santa is not necessarily a lie..  teach her the whole point of Santa is to be unselfish (giving a gift labelled from Santa so you don\u2019t get the credit for it or doing a good deed without expecting anything in return), empathetic behaviour (point out 2-3 examples of her showing empathy & consideration of others feelings, good deeds, etc) and tell her her heart is so big now she\u2019s ready to become a Santa.\n\nYou can get her to choose someone she\u2019d like to help out (bake for, get a small gift, help shovel snow off driveway when old enough, etc) - could be a relative, neighbour, family friend? and explain what Christmas Spirit means", "While at 6 years old, it's possible to figure it out yourself. \n\nI think telling a 6 year old is cruel, you're alienating her from her peers. She has a dark secret and they all get to believe in the magic or she can chose to ruin it for them too. \n\n Also, this isn't about you, it's about her, so YTA.", "NTA. The concept of Santa is stupid. I find it weird that people actually believe in it. As a kid I didn\u2019t have to be told it was fake. How is a man delivering presents all over the world in a single night & how is he getting in  our apartment when we don\u2019t even have a chimney? \n\nI once saw someone on this sub say that they believed in Santa till they were 11. I was extremely confused.", "NTA. Lying to your children bc it's tradition is messed up.  She asked you a question and you gave her the honest answer. Yes, you should have talked it through with your wife first, but is it more important for your child to believe in magic or to know she can trust you to be honest? \n\n\n\nPersonally, finding out Santa/the tooth fairy/ whatever weren't really really shook me, bc it felt like my entire family was lying to me for their own amusement. I would have enjoyed Christmas just as much if I knew exactly who my presents came from. The magic wasn't a fat old guy breaking into my house to leave me presents he knew I wanted bc he'd been spying on me. The magic was family and friends and decorations and food. \n\n\nAlso, I had a hard time distinguishing between deception and faith, so I decided god was made up as well and started questioning everything when we went to church. I couldn't understand why my family decided to keep up this lie as if it were fact when they'd caved and admitted everything else was myths and fantasies. It was ... not good.", "YTA. I believed in Santa until I was 18. When my dad asked me if I knew he wasn\u2019t real, it stung but I could handle it. For a 6 year old child, finding out like this is bound to be traumatic. You\u2019ve ruined Christmas for your daughter and probably your wife too and I hope you come to realize that.", "nta. honesty is important in parenting and it's commendable that you didn't want to continue the santa claus charade. it's understandable that your daughter was upset at first but it's also important for her to learn the truth. kids grow up eventually and being honest about santa can help them develop critical thinking skills. enjoy your holiday season with your family!", "YTA for how you went about it - and that this is something that you and your wife should have discussed and agreed upon together. You contradicted and undermined her.", "NTA. I think you and your wife should have had an agreement to fall back on prior to the question. But, its not like we get a do over because we didn't actually have a plan for this. I think that at her age, the illusion likely is starting to fade anyway? I figure that when a kid reaches first grade they will meet other children who don't believe? And because I work with kids, I know that some of them think quite linearly and they seek information to relive fear and doubt *sometimes.*\n\nAt any rate, just for kicks, I did an informal survey and this is what I read: *Broken down, the  research showed that 85 percent of four-year-olds believed wholeheartedly, while 65 percent of six-year-olds and only 25 percent of eight-year-olds were still down with Jolly Old Saint Nicholas. In terms of Santa's believe-o-meter, three- and four-year-olds generate the most juice, because that's when they first start to understand the magic of Santa. By age eight, kids begin to acknowledge the unlikeliness of one man travelling the world in a single night.*\n\nThe average age where the most children have lost that belief system in the U.S. is supposed to be 8-years-old. And children who don't have older siblings are likely to stop believing earlier.\n\nTBF, I can't criticize you because I find myself wanting my kids to think for themselves as much as I want them to enjoy the magic of the holiday season. And so, all I would have done was spoken to my spouse about it privately and told him, 'I think its time because she's asking. That means she's ready for more information.'", "NTA - IMHO, if they are old enough to ask, they are old enough to know.   Not believing Santa is real does not mean you cannot still do all the fun Santa things.   \n\nMy children are all in their 20s.   I told them about Santa, but I did not go way over the top - no hoof prints in the snow, no sleigh bells outside their windows, no you must be good or else.

I come from a culture where we celebrate Christmas but absolutely no child thinks that Santa is real. It didn\u2019t ruin my childhood. Christmas was always incredibly exciting. We knew the gifts were from our family and it was still exciting. \n\nMy kids always knew that Santa was pretend and that it was like a game everyone plays together, even the grownups, to pretend he\u2019s real. \n\nOn the other hand, my husband does come from a \u201cSanta is real\u201d culture and in his family there are stories of children feeling deeply betrayed when they find out the truth.

You really should\u2019ve just said yes and moved on. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve lied to your child about other things before. But instead you chose to make her sad. She\u2019s 6 dude. You should\u2019ve let her experience the magic of Christmas for a couple more years.", "Yta for spoiling Xmas for a 6 year old. Out of spite no less. And going against your wife's wishes.

When I got home I told my mom what had happened and asked her about it and she told me that that girl was just fibbing to me and Santa is real. But me being a curious 6-year-old and having conflicting huge news thrown at me I didn't know what to believe. So I stayed up all night until I heard gifts being put under the tree I peaked around the door and seen my mom out there and I remember I was so angry and hurt and sad and let down and I ran to the living room and started punching my mom saying you're a liar I knew it why didn't you just tell me the truth. She tried telling me that she is just helping Santa that he's so busy he drops the gifts off and then she puts them under the tree for him and I'm like no just tell me the truth and then she was finally honest with me and I accepted it.

We reach the scene where the elves are working on Santa\u2019s sled to make it fly because not enough people believe in Santa. My daughter latches on to this and just keeps asking,\u201dIs Santa real?\u201d.  Her mother said yes, but my daughter kept asking me as well. I said, \u201cSanta is a great idea, and a lot of fun, but no he is not real.\u201d\n\nFor some context, I love Christmas, but I didn\u2019t get to celebrate Christmas until I had a family of my own. I was raised in a family whose religion prohibited Christmas. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out and experience all the moments I missed. So we do Christmas as big as we can. All the stereotypical traditions. And for the past five Christmases I\u2019ve passively went along with the Santa idea with my daughter, even though I told my wife that I didn\u2019t like lying to her, and I didn\u2019t see the point in lying about something that would eventually come out no matter what.  I also told my wife that I wouldn\u2019t lie if I was ever asked. Well the moment finally came. She asked me and I said he wasn\u2019t real. \n\nAt first my daughter was fine. My wife gave her some long explanation as to why she is lucky we get her presents. My daughter didn\u2019t really like this explanation and was upset. We both told her that some parents work really hard to convince their kids that Santa exists, and that she shouldn\u2019t try to convince kids otherwise. My wife definitely felt like I should have lied. Eventually my wife asked my daughter if learning that Santa wasn\u2019t real changed how she feels about Christmas, and my daughter said \u201ckinda\u201d. \n\nMy wife thinks I should have lied; that kids believing in Santa is harmless, and that I can\u2019t relate to Christmas from a child\u2019s perspective because I didn\u2019t have those experiences. I think we played along with a tradition for as along as we could, but when my daughter directly asked me, the truth was the better option. I can\u2019t really walk this one back, and we all will have a good holiday, but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We don\u2019t lie to our kids about Sinterklaas. And they still love it.

It didn\u2019t traumatize me but I cried quite a bit about it that year. My sister did it out of spite but it didn\u2019t change the truth.

And then when we tell them Santa isn't real we still have to try and convince them God is real too. Seems counter productive. \n\nIMO God is real, the crazy stories are embellished and the Bible has some obvious double sided verses.", "NTA, it\u2019s not that big of a deal", "NTA\n\nAs someone who grew up without being lied to about Santa Claus being real, I never got why some people feel like Christmas can only feel \u201cmagical\u201d for kids if they believe in Santa. I always felt like Christmas was magical growing up. The gifts wouldn\u2019t appear under the tree and the stockings wouldn\u2019t be stuffed until after we all went to sleep on Christmas Eve, we would put out cookies and milk for Santa and carrots for the reindeer even though we knew my mom was eating them, we would put lights up and decorate the outside of our house and have Santa blowups or decorations, and we could watch Christmas movies and enjoy the \u201clegend\u201d of Santa without actually having to really believe in him. The only difference was that I knew the magic of Christmas was created by my family and not a mythical being, and that made me extra thankful for them.\n\nI think the reason people who grow up actually believing in him feel like the magic is gone once they find out is because it\u2019s been made a big deal to them that he is real, and they feel like they\u2019ve been deceived and feel embarrassed that they would \u201cfall for the trick\u201d even if there were only good intentions behind the deception. Plus, I\u2019m sure in a lot of these households, the parents stop doing the magical things once all of the kids no longer believe, like waiting till night to put the gifts out. If the whole tradition of what their Christmas is like is based on the idea that Santa is real and that all crumbles when they find out he isn\u2019t, then of course it\u2019s going to be painful to find out the truth. \n\nAll this to say, I don\u2019t think this has to mean the end of Christmas magic for your daughter. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about being honest with her, it\u2019s hard to lie to your kid when they ask you something directly, and if she didn\u2019t hear the truth from you or her mom, she would have heard it from kids at her school soon. You probably should have talked to your wife first, but this hard day was going to come anyway regardless of how long you waited to tell her. I would suggest spending this next Christmas showing your daughter that Christmas isn\u2019t going to change just because she no longer believes in Santa. It can still be magical even if mom and dad are the ones making it special for her and not Santa. You can also introduce her to the other magical side of Christmas which is picking out gifts for people you love. Maybe let her pick out a gift for her mom (with your help) that can be from her. Let her know that now that she knows the \u201csecret\u201d of Christmas, she gets to experience \u201cbeing Santa\u201d which can be fun too!", "I'm going against the grain here. NTA.

The world robs people of being able to believe in whimsical, magical things. Children shouldn\u2019t be robbed of that early.", "Agreed. My wife is an atheist and I\u2019m not and neither of us would ever do that in front of the kids about a god/gods, and certainly not about Santa.

This way, the Santa construct is not a lie that ...gets discovered, but an unfolding series of good deeds and Christmas spirit.\n\n>When they are 6 or 7, whenever you see that dawning suspicion that Santa may not be a material being, that means the child is ready.\nI take them out \"for coffee\" at the local wherever. We get a booth, order our drinks, and the following pronouncement is made:\n\u201cYou sure have grown an awful lot this year. Not only are you taller, but I can see that your heart has grown, too.

In fact, your heart has grown so much that I think you are ready to become a Santa Claus.\n\n>You probably have noticed that most of the Santas you see are people dressed up like him.

What does Santa get for all of his trouble? [lead the kid from \"cookies\" to the good feeling of having done something for someone else]. Well, now YOU are ready to do your first job as a Santa!\"\nMake sure you maintain the proper conspiratorial tone.\n\n>We then have the child choose someone they know--a neighbour, usually. The child's mission is to secretly, deviously, find out something that the person needs, and then provide it, wrap it, deliver it--and never reveal to the target where it came from. Being a Santa isn't about getting credit, you see. It's unselfish giving.\n\n>My oldest chose the \"witch lady\" on the corner. She really was horrible--had a fence around the house and would never let the kids go in and get a stray ball or Frisbee. She'd yell at them to play quieter, etc--a real pill. He noticed when we drove to school that she came out every morning to get her paper in bare feet, so he decided she needed slippers. So then he had to go spy and decide how big her feet were. He hid in the bushes one Saturday, and decided she was a medium. We went to Kmart and bought warm slippers. He wrapped them up, and tagged it \"merry Christmas from Santa.\" After dinner one evening, he slipped down to her house, and slid the package under her driveway gate. The next morning, we watched her waddle out to get the paper, pick up the present, and go inside. My son was all excited, and couldn't wait to see what would happen next. The next morning, as we drove off, there she was, out getting her paper--wearing the slippers. He was ecstatic. I had to remind him that NO ONE could ever know what he did, or he wouldn't be a Santa.\n\n>Over the years, he chose a good number of targets, always coming up with a unique present just for them. One year, he polished up his bike, put a new seat on it, and gave it to one of our friend's daughters. These people were and are very poor. We did ask the dad if it was ok. The look on her face, when she saw the bike on the patio with a big bow on it, was almost as good as the look on my son's face.\n\n>When it came time for Son #2 to join the ranks, my oldest came along, and helped with the induction speech. They are both excellent gifters, by the way, and never felt that they had been lied to--because they were let in on the Secret of Being a Santa.\"\n\n\nCredit: Leslie Rush\nhttps://www.kidsinadelaide.com.au/sharing-the-spirit-of-christmas/", "I feel like there's no right way to do it, but there's definitely wrong ways. My dad was definitely one of the wrong ways. \n\nFor context, I had known Santa wasn't real for a few years. And I confirmed it when I found my presents one year before Christmas. Also very important to note, my parents are TERRIBLE with keeping promises. Not in a malicious sort of way, just simply that I think they forget or end up remembering things differently. Which brings me to this particular Christmas. My parents had asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I told them a few things. A few days later they asked me again. I took this as they weren't going to get the things I mentioned previously, so I named some other things. Then this same thing transpired again, so I came up with a few more ideas (Christmases varied a lot when I was a kid so I never knew what to expect). After listing these things, my dad got very pissed off and replied with \"You know Santa isn't real and your mom and I buy everything, right? We can't afford everything you want!\" I was completely shocked. I thought I was being nice and working with them when apparently it was being taken completely opposite.\n\nThe most frustrating thing however is that my dad continues to insist Santa is real. All my presents, even as an adult, have been from Santa and if I ever thank my parents for the gifts he'll put on this big show about how he's not Santa and if I don't believe I won't get presents next year. It's as if that whole event never happened, which again is very consistent with what Christmas was like growing up with them. One year my car needed new tires to pass inspection and my dad told me that Santa would get them for me. I made an appointment at the garage we always used for after Christmas and told my dad about it. He got mad at me for \"expecting\" him to pay for them, and I ended up footing the bill myself.

She told me : 'stop telling me that, otherwise i will know it' !", "I mean, there is a ton of history behind why we have Santa. Santa is pretty real in that sense. The spirit of Christmas is very real, because we make it so. There\u2019s something deeply human about celebrating holidays together, and it\u2019s as real as anything. Is Santa real? Is God real? Is Bigfoot real? Is anything real? Are you real?", "However, St. Nicholas' feast day is December 6th. He comes around and fills kids shoes with candy, money, and small gifts. My family celebrated this holiday when I was a kid, so I would always get into arguments with other kids about if Santa and St. Nicholas were the same person, and if so, why does Santa come on Christmas instead of St. Nicholas Day.", "I think what's often overlooked is that it lets kids be selfish too. A little kid who knows their family doesn't have a lot of money might try to curb their wishlist to fit the family budget. Another kid might feel like their present to their parents is inadequate because they get more stuff at Christmas than mom and dad do.", "This yes!!!

She would say stuff like \"oh I know your Santa?\" or \"when you going to admit your Santa?\". I never directly lied. I would say \"what are you talking about?\" or \"who told you that?\" But in a playful joking way. It became kind of a joke the next year. She *knew*. Then she asked \"why haven't you ever admitted you are Santa?\" And I said \"youve never asked me directly.\" Then at nine she ask me directly and I was honest. I said \"of course I'm Santa. But Santa is also something else. He's the feeling of Christmas. The feeling of family and love and kindness and desserts and pretty lights and presents, all of that.

If a kid enjoys Santa and a family wants to do the Santa thing, that's fine. At the same time a kid being raised without Santa isn't wrong. By the time kids start questioning they are old enough to be told. Some people have talked about how they wish someone told them when they asked because it was making an aspect of the holidays confusing. A clear answer of no may be way more satisfying to hear than a non-answer response of \"He gives you presents doesn't he?\" With the most clear one being the truth. They may not care if he's real or not. Other kids will prefer the honest truth because they want to be treated like a big kid/grownup.  A few did feel a bit of betrayal and then got over it.

Some want to believe, others don't want to be babied, handfuls view it after learning as a gaslighting  story for no reason. People rasing kids without Santa can explain how it's similar to religion. We teach kids not to stomp on others religions if we're decent people. We can do the same with Santa.", "You just have to recognize that a lot of people didn't get to share that experience when they were kids. You were able to benefit from it, but a lot of folks grew up in much different circumstances. \n\nTake for instance someone who grew up as part of the Jehovah's Witnesses and wasn't able to celebrate holidays. If they grew up and deconstructed the faith they were raised with, they'd likely have a lot of personal trauma around being \"lied to\" by their parents and the people they trusted.\n\nIn turn, they might resolve to not lie to their own kids.

I feel bad for OPs wife and child now that magic has been ripped from them", "This is unnecessarily deep in the weeds but it reminded me of something I read recently which is that belief is doubt. \n\nThink of it this way: little kids KNOW Santa is real. To them, he is. There is no doubt. Like us, as a silly example: I know I have bones in my legs. I\u2019ve never seen them for myself, but I know they\u2019re there. I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cI believe I have bones.\u201d But a step further: I believe the COVID vaccine works. But I don\u2019t know it.

Take kids who know their dolls aren\u2019t real babies, but they believe they are real. Adults, though, it\u2019s one or the other. We believe something until we either a) see it for ourselves, or b) have taken in enough convincing information that we no longer doubt it. \n\nSo, if a kid is contextualizing Santa as a belief, they have doubt somewhere. Even framing Santa as a belief can sew the seed in a child\u2019s mind. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the tangent. I lost track of my own point here.", "It felt so jealous.

Lying has no place in that. Our Christmases are no less joyful, magical and immersive because we choose to root our family ties in truth.

The original is not in English, but its a song from a child's perspective about meeting Santa (or our equivalent). The child is surprised Santa's has to go again after dropping of the presents, so the old man explains there are so many people and wishes to fulfill and every one is important to him, so he has to go quickly. Then a few years later the same child is worriedly waiting for Santa's to tell him, that there's more and more people and that he can't make it on his own. That if each of us helps, Santa doesn't have to work so hard. That the key to happiness is kindness to one another.\n\n\nWe sing this song and every time someone chokes up, because even though I suck at translating it, my dad did a damn good job writing that one. When you see children singing/listening and stopping to think about the song, it's a good time to propose The Talk. Not to tell them there is no Santa, but that there really is a lot of work around Christmas, and so all the good people do their best to help Santa, like in the song. They can start by helping mom or dad find some small present for somebody else. Or using pocket money to get or even make some for their parents. It's a big responsibility to help Santa.\n\n\nThen a few years later we explain more. Santa is not a physical man. He is the idea of Christmas magic, the effort of all the people \"helping Santa\" around the world, and making it a magical time for everyone, especially small kids who do not understand yet. \"Now that you are big and wise enough for it, you too are a part of this, you have been for a while. You now have a double duty. On top of helping Santa\nYou have to keep the secret, to keep the magic alive. \"\n\n\nI have loved this as a child, so did my brother and my cousins.

My mom was unreliable like that, too, and that later refusal to see how their own unreliability made you not trust them just completely tracks.

She went on to tell us that if our parents had propped him up as more important than Jesus then our parents were going to hell so we needed to get our priorities in order. Not only were parents pissed about not even having the option of how to handle it as a family, but they also had the added fun of trying to soothe them about their parents' damnation. It was a parochial school, so it was technically allowed, but I think she did get in trouble for that. I was pretty solidly atheist by the time I was 10. I always find it funny when parents go that route because they think public school is lacking religion (read: Jesus) in classrooms but I find there's nothing more damaging to their faith than using Jesus as a weapon to control behaviors they don't want to deal with.\n\nI taught up until last year and there was always at least one kid in the earliest grades proudly announcing to the class that Santa wasn't real so I do think that there's a way to be ambiguous about it without lying to your child but it's also hard to get across the impact that news could have on other kids. We dread that day every year because most of them will argue that he IS real and go home and ask questions, with enough kids coming in with confirmation the next day that their parents confirmed, and then the rest of the week is helping some of the more sensitive ones move past it. \n\nI know a lot of people say even starting the belief is a cruelty but adulthood is already horrible enough that I hate seeing kids deprived of the one period of time that seems whimsical. Finding out the way I did had no impact on how i felt about my parents for lying to me, but I thought it was completely unnecessary that one person felt the need to decide that their personal feelings on that tradition needed to be everyone else's. My parents always made sure that Santa was the one who brought not the big ticket items because it was too costly to get EVERY child a nintendo, but something modest that would become really special to me, like one year it was one of those teddy bears you could draw on and then wash. If they had the funds that year I'd get the nintendo from mom and dad, and if they didn't, he would help me learn how to save birthday money etc. until I could buy it myself. It helped me start thinking about families who struggled and we'd get more involved in charities that helped santa \"find\" the houses and make sure every kid got their special Santa gifts.

If my parents were gonna to lie to me about Santa, why should I believe they were telling me the truth about God and heaven?\n\nIt's probably a good thing I don't have kids because I've never been comfortable with the whole Santa thing. Not on good terms with religion anymore either, but finding out my parents were lying about Santa and Tooth Fairy and then my grandfather dying and them trying to tell me he was in heaven... that was hard.", "I\u2019m not Christian and I was still pissed. \nI\u2019m pissed again thinking about it.", "As a Christian, this is one of the biggest reasons I refused to lie to my kids about Santa existing (along with the tooth fairy, Easter bunny, etc).", "I am beyond appalled at the number of Christians who tell their children Santa and the Easter Bunny are real!

Christmas is about celebrating the birth of Christ (it\u2019s literally in the name) and the spirit of giving. Santa is uncomfortably close to idolizing, which is a big sin. We teach the real history of St. Nickolas and how he is celebrated today through Santa but we don\u2019t center our Holiday around it. We respect other peoples choices but it IS VERY contradictory\u2026", "That\u2019s a big leap that because you were devastated, all parents are lying to themselves if they go along with Santa. I didn\u2019t see it as a betrayal, my older son didn\u2019t and agreed to keep the magic alive for his little brother. Because of how ubiquitous Santa is, it a choice you have to make, especially how you deal with it when kids question it. There are way too many people who view it positively to think everyone should see it the way you do. \n\nThat would be like if I said my mom took me to a haunted house and it was really traumatizing (which did happen), but then generalized it to say all parents should are lying to themselves if they think it\u2019s ok to scare kids like that. I was the same age as most of the kids there, my mom didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d react. I can still remember the visceral panic and sobbing and feeling insecure in the dark for a long time (I still sleep with a nightlight). My bad experience doesn\u2019t make taking a kid to a haunted house a bad idea, and yours doesn\u2019t make Santa one either. As I grew up I realized my mom was just doing something she thought I would like, and I forgave her. If you didn\u2019t like it, and don\u2019t want to do it with your kids (if any), that\u2019s understandable, but everyone else isn\u2019t going to stop having fun because you didn\u2019t like it.", "I am so surprised by how many people had this experience because it was completely the opposite for me.

The country we used to live in actually had a business of like a personal Santas you could hire to do home visits and hand out gifts. One time, for a party, my dad was tapped to be the Santa because we had a really multicultural group of friends and my dad is a polyglot, so he could communicate with a lot of the kids in their own languages. Boy, was I shocked at the level of detail Santa knew about me! But, when I eventually found out he wasn't real, it really wasn't a big deal. I loved how magical those previous Christmases were, and I enjoyed learning about the different Santa traditions other families had. It made me really appreciate the comfort of believing in something magical. I also think I have a way less adversarial attitude towards religion than a lot of other atheists I know, and I'm much more comfortable in religious spaces and kind of just taking the messages I like and leaving the rest. I don't know if it has anything to do with that, but it was great to have these little magical moments when I was a kid and I kind of just naturally grew out of them without much fuss.", "I remember when my dad got married again after my parents had divorced, he said Santa was going to come to their house AND my mom's house because he had asked Santa to do it last year.

Kids are assholes, and the kid who is saying the magic man that brings gifts doesn't exist is going to be treated badly.\n\nI remember back when I was in school, I was in some elective period where I was being a teacher's assistant in a kinder class and one of the girls kept insisting that Santa was dead, and that Rudolph was a robot and thats why his nose was red.

I specifically told my oldest that if other kids believe Santa is real, he can pretend, because it's not up to us to tell them it's up to their families. I don't want him to spoil it for someone else.

Lying to children is wrong and will compromise their trust in you.", "NTA... while lying about santa has been happening for a very long time, it's up to each individual parent to decide whether they agree with the lie or not.

It made me feel like they felt I was stupid. I get that wasn\u2019t their intention, but parents should really just tell their kids the truth if they ask them something like this.", "NTA. Don't lie to your kids. Our western culture has basically peer pressured us into thinking Christmas is ONLY fun if we tell some fairytale to our kids but that's simply not true.

Gaslighting them into thinking something like Santa is real can do nothing but harm their psychology.", "Idk, your kid clearly wanted your take and you gave it to her honestly.

At least half the kids in my school said he wasn't - I remember I didn't know what to believe. But I expect she'd have started hearing that he's not real from other kids this year or next. As others have said, is probably not the best move to directly contradict your parenting partner in front of your kid, but NTA in any real way.\n\nAnd honestly, there will probably be a time when she's glad to know you're going to give her an honest answer about difficult things.

Told my mom later while crying because I felt ashamed it didn\u2019t work and in front of my friends from class , and she very carefully told me that it wasn\u2019t real magic, and it was her putting the toy there.

In front of the whole class, you called the boy a liar when in fact he wasn't. You also said that if the kids who believed in Santa will be rewarded with presents, and those that don't believe (like the little boy) will get punished without any presents from Santa.

I asked to borrow a hundred bucks for a diagnostic on my car because it was vibrating.  He insisted everything was fine and refused to loan me the money.  A week later the drive shaft fell off the car.  The clamps had been loose. The original cost to fix would have been about two hundred.  The new cost? $800. And he had to loan me the the money because now it was an emergency and I was going to get fired and then evicted without a car.\n\nHe always blamed my mom for badmouthing him to us, that she must have told us how he never follows through.

Mom and Dad buy those. Because 1. I put effort into buying those presents and Santa's not getting the thanks for it. 2. My kid doesn't need to think Santa treats kids unfairly by giving some people more than others.\n\nSanta can bring socks and some candy.", "Yes there is. I was pissed when my parents told me he wasn\u2019t real. I felt like part of my innocence and imagination were taken from me for no good reason.", "Yeah Americans are just stupid that way, they think they can lie their way out of reality to \u201cprotect\u201d kids (except if they\u2019re adopted, then apparently it\u2019s important you remind them of this from birth). All it really does is make it hard for kids to deal with reality and modulate the anxiety that comes with living in an imperfect world. If you\u2019d never heard about death until grandma died it\u2019s going to be a much bigger shock than if your parents just admitted to you that yes, death is a part of life. \n\nIn the rest of the world kids know life has dangers like death and disease. You don\u2019t need to rub it in, but pretending your friend\u2019s grandma went to the giant nursing home in the sky is effing stupid. Kids understand what they\u2019re taught.", "I would also consider the context. I wouldn't tell them Santa doesn't exist during a christmas movie. That question probably came up because iirc it does come up in the movie(Elf) that ppl say Santa isn't real. So asking if Santa is real or not isn't their own thought. They didn't suspect anything, they want confirmation that Santa exists.", "There\u2019s so much bad in the world today, kids should be able to enjoy the magic of Christmas for as long as possible!", "It doesn\u2019t change the notable contradictions that have to do with Santa. And kids notice these things. At least some do. \n\nLike even some basic logical stuff like why do we right letters to Santa if he knows everything? Why is it that some years we do get what we want and some we don\u2019t. You mean to tell me that Santa can build video game consoles in his factories? Like it just isn\u2019t a sustainable lie even for very young kids. This guy\u2019s daughter was already catching on when she asked him. \n\nThis just seems more like it\u2019s for adults than kids because they have this nostalgia thing for the idea of believing in Santa when it seems kind of mundane for most people. The magic doesn\u2019t end when you stop believing in Santa so why is he necessary? Why bother with it at all?", "Same here. It was definitely like, we all know Santa isn't real, it's just a fun tradition. One year my sister and I got my parents an upgraded TV and got to \"play Santa\" and put it out after sending our parents to bed one Christmas Eve.

I was 36.", "People act like pretending Santa is real is some kind of huge lie or future trauma that you are going to inflict on a kid, but like it\u2019s literally the same thing as going to a magic show or meeting their favorite characters at a theme park. Eventually they\u2019ll learn that magic tricks aren\u2019t real magic and that the Princess they met is just an actress, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was some messed up psychological manipulation. Kids like to imagine things and it\u2019s good for adults to encourage that. Then when they\u2019re older, they can appreciate all the ingenuity it took to create the illusion. When I finally learned Santa wasn\u2019t real, my first thought was, wow, it was really cool how my parents did all these little things to make him seem so real. I want to be part of that for my younger sister next year!", "I'm shocked by how many comments I've gotten about how parents shouldn't lie to their kids, as though that's all this is. The world was much more fun when I believed in Santa, leprechauns with pots of gold, monsters and all the rest. I don't want to deprive my children from the sense of wonder and imagination that goes along with those things. It just requires dealing with these things appropriately.", "I love this!

My kids started believing in Santa on their own. I would have Never tried to convince them. I didn't want to lie to them.

Basically whatever they want to do with the belief is fine with me. We've never left out cookies, but they can if they want to. I never asked them to write (through me) to Santa. They did once or twice. They also believe in the tooth fairy. Also not my idea of fun... But I do draw the line at Elf in the stupid shelf. Hell to the no!  They're 5 and 7 now. I don't know how long they'll believe, but I hope it just fades as gently as it started.", "I loved being \"in on it\" for my younger siblings, and so did my next sister.
