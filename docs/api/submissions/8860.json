I asked her what was going on because we talk daily and have always been there for each other and had an open and very honest form of communication. I can't think of one possible scenario that would cause her to think I don't have her back. She says she just has stuff going on with family and what not but that's all she has said, basically. However, she stopped being communicative to me probably about 3 weeks ago and her videos expressing being her own best friend and only being able to depend on herself increased significantly. I'm not the type of friend to pry. I will ask you once and if you don't want to talk about it or you beat around the bush, I won't beg you to tell me. I will let you come to me when you are ready to talk. I've always been like this because I personally hate it when people pry for information so I refuse to be that person. She knows this, obviously. She knows me better than anyone else. \n\nSo anyways, her videos talking about this stuff increased and her communication became slim. It went from us speaking all day every day to now us only speaking once every other day or so and me always being the one to initiate contact. So I just stopped trying and went about my life with the idea that if she was ready to talk than she would come to me. Well, she did yesterday and expressed that I don't try hard enough to get her to talk about things and that she wants someone to care enough to \"make her talk\". Like I said, I've never been this person. I never will be that person. This is how it's been for 16 years. So I told her I don't play that game. Instead of saying this from the beginning she just posted videos on TikTok talking about not being able to rely on anyone and being her own best friend, which imo was an attack on me considering everyone knows how close we are. So instead of being an adult and communicating this, she just jumped right on social media and started essentially bashing me without saying my name. I told her it was childish and I won't feed in to it. She said I'm an AH for not understanding and that I could have been nicer about it and actually shown that I care.

You're 16 and have established good expectations for people afaik.

She could have a real conversation with you on a one to one basis, but chooses instead to publicly hurl passive aggressive statements your way. it could be jealousy, or insecurity, but you trying to help her will just lead to more games, acting out and your own frustration and exhaustion.

Nothing good ever comes out from begging to tell more after they refuse to talk or somd shit. What you did initially was the right thing to do.

I asked her what was going on \n\n>for not understanding and that I could have been nicer about it and actually shown that I care. \n\nYou did. You understood that the initial videos indicated a problem. You showed you cared by reaching out and attempting to discover/help the problem.\n\nShe chose not to accept that help. You would have been the AH if you pressured someone, who had indicated they didn't want to talk about it, to talk. You were very respectful *while* showing your concern. Kudos on that, btw, that's actually very hard to manage. \n\n>she wants someone to care enough to \"make her talk\"\n\n1st, that's not \"care\". Adults don't *make* other adults do something out of care. \n\n2nd, one person's *wants* are not another person's *obligations*.  My friend might want me to go skydiving. I'm afraid of heights so she gonna have to keep on wanting. Would it be fair for her to berate me for not fulfilling her \"want\"?\n\n3rd: I'm sure you *want* to not be attacked on social media. To have a friend who doesn't play games. Who can open up without being forced to do so. Who talks like an adult instead of leaving hints and clues lying around like a child ahead of their birthday. No? Why should her wants outweigh yours?\n\nAgain, NTA. And I'm fairly certain she's just become kinda toxic and entitled, but...\n\nthere is a chance this is a cry for help that might indicate a bigger problem... if this is totally out of character for your friend (and please, be honest with yourself about that) and you value this 16 year long friendship... it *might* be worth trying to find out what the family issues are? Could be something serious which is causing a mental health issue she can't adequately control right now?\n\nThat said, if she unloads a bunch of drama, and it's really not serious and she's obviously just playing games, well... 16 years is a long time, and yeah, people change. \"Is this still someone you want to be friends with?\" might be the next question you need to ask.", "NTA  \"Make her talk\"?  *Really?*  The first thing that I thought of was a creepy looking guy with a bad German accent being involved.", "ESH\n\nShe's being weird and immature with the posts, but it's also not a \"game\" to have different needs when it comes to communication in a friendship. Sounds like you're just not as compatible as you thought, and you're both being kind of assy about it.", "Adults acting like teenagers for public attention is so cringe, it might actually end my friendship with someone.", "The childish games I'm referring to is her not communicating with me and instead bringing it to social media to bash me.", "Ok, but what you said was (paraphrasing) \"she said she needs people to draw conversations out of her, and I said '*I don't play that game.*'\"", "yeah, but what's wrong with what OP said? their friend just started bashing them for no reason because they want someone to make them talk about their struggles. OP doesn't want to pry into anyone's life and takes no as an answer. OP isn't the AH for not wanting to play along with whatever weird mind game their friend is trying do."]}
