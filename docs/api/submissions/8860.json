I asked her what was going on because we talk daily and have always been there for each other and had an open and very honest form of communication. I can't think of one possible scenario that would cause her to think I don't have her back. She says she just has stuff going on with family and what not but that's all she has said, basically. However, she stopped being communicative to me probably about 3 weeks ago and her videos expressing being her own best friend and only being able to depend on herself increased significantly. I'm not the type of friend to pry. I will ask you once and if you don't want to talk about it or you beat around the bush, I won't beg you to tell me. I will let you come to me when you are ready to talk. I've always been like this because I personally hate it when people pry for information so I refuse to be that person. She knows this, obviously. She knows me better than anyone else. \n\nSo anyways, her videos talking about this stuff increased and her communication became slim. It went from us speaking all day every day to now us only speaking once every other day or so and me always being the one to initiate contact. So I just stopped trying and went about my life with the idea that if she was ready to talk than she would come to me. Well, she did yesterday and expressed that I don't try hard enough to get her to talk about things and that she wants someone to care enough to \"make her talk\". Like I said, I've never been this person. I never will be that person. This is how it's been for 16 years. So I told her I don't play that game. Instead of saying this from the beginning she just posted videos on TikTok talking about not being able to rely on anyone and being her own best friend, which imo was an attack on me considering everyone knows how close we are. So instead of being an adult and communicating this, she just jumped right on social media and started essentially bashing me without saying my name. I told her it was childish and I won't feed in to it. She said I'm an AH for not understanding and that I could have been nicer about it and actually shown that I care.

You're 16 and have established good expectations for people afaik.

You need to communicate with me if you want to talk.\" \n\nIts not a terrible loss to make new friends at your (or any) age, so don't let this weigh too heavily on you.", "NTA You are right it is a game and it is a manipulative one. She could have a real conversation with you on a one to one basis, but chooses instead to publicly hurl passive aggressive statements your way. it could be jealousy, or insecurity, but you trying to help her will just lead to more games, acting out and your own frustration and exhaustion.

Nothing good ever comes out from begging to tell more after they refuse to talk or somd shit. What you did initially was the right thing to do.

I asked her what was going on \n\n>for not understanding and that I could have been nicer about it and actually shown that I care. \n\nYou did. You understood that the initial videos indicated a problem. You showed you cared by reaching out and attempting to discover/help the problem.\n\nShe chose not to accept that help. You would have been the AH if you pressured someone, who had indicated they didn't want to talk about it, to talk. You were very respectful *while* showing your concern. Kudos on that, btw, that's actually very hard to manage. \n\n>she wants someone to care enough to \"make her talk\"\n\n1st, that's not \"care\". Adults don't *make* other adults do something out of care. \n\n2nd, one person's *wants* are not another person's *obligations*.  My friend might want me to go skydiving. I'm afraid of heights so she gonna have to keep on wanting. Would it be fair for her to berate me for not fulfilling her \"want\"?\n\n3rd: I'm sure you *want* to not be attacked on social media. To have a friend who doesn't play games. Who can open up without being forced to do so. Who talks like an adult instead of leaving hints and clues lying around like a child ahead of their birthday. No? Why should her wants outweigh yours?\n\nAgain, NTA. And I'm fairly certain she's just become kinda toxic and entitled, but...\n\nthere is a chance this is a cry for help that might indicate a bigger problem... if this is totally out of character for your friend (and please, be honest with yourself about that) and you value this 16 year long friendship... it *might* be worth trying to find out what the family issues are? Could be something serious which is causing a mental health issue she can't adequately control right now?\n\nThat said, if she unloads a bunch of drama, and it's really not serious and she's obviously just playing games, well... 16 years is a long time, and yeah, people change. \"Is this still someone you want to be friends with?\" might be the next question you need to ask.", "NTA  \"Make her talk\"?  *Really?*  The first thing that I thought of was a creepy looking guy with a bad German accent being involved.", "ESH\n\nShe's being weird and immature with the posts, but it's also not a \"game\" to have different needs when it comes to communication in a friendship.

I misread this at first that you were both 16, at which point I'd have been mildly forgiving of your friend. But she is a grown ass woman acting like this. You don't need to pry this out of her if she wants to play dumb games.", "NTA\n\nMight be time to recognize that in the 16 years of knowing her, you've grown into two different people - who may no longer find the same love or support from the relationship that you need.\n\nIt also sounds like your friend is... Idk... Caught by the TikTok algo.\n\nSometimes we grow out of friendships. That's fine.\n\nYou're growing older, growing up. She... Uhm... Is to, in her own way.\n\nMaybe time to walk separate paths a while. Maybe in the future paths cross again and she'll be better. \n\nOr she'll be viral on TikTok and somehow, for sure for sure, it'll make her life better.", "NTA. You deflected her childish attempts at emotional manipulation. She may be on route to destroying the friendship.", "NTA\n\nIs she actually 16? Then again, a lot of 16 year olds are much more mature than this.", "NTA\n\nYou did try to be a good friend by asking, she chose to play games you are 100% right about that. \n\nThe vying for attention on social media despite your attempts to reach out are petty and instead of using her big girl words and have a conversation she chose this route.", "I knew people like this. They were emotionally and mentally exhausting. We weren't best friends or anything as we didn't have much in common but eventually I unfollowed them on Facebook so I didn't have to read their posts anymore. Before I took that step though, I would respond to their posts \"let me know if you need someone to talk/vent to\" and leave it at that. Most of the time they didn't take me up on it. Admittedly, I also went through a stage when I did attention posts when my mom died. I think a lot of people do it without realizing. I noticed I was a hypocrite though and tried to be more mature in my grieving process.\n\nYou asked, she denied. \"Force her to talk\", what does she want you to do? Tie her to a chair or something??  Or perhaps she was unhappy you didn't comment asking what's up every time? \n\nNTA regardless. Could you have asked more than once? Sure. But you can't \"force her to talk\" like she wants and she was wanting attention in a childish manner. Whatever is bothering her, she needs a more productive and mature approach in dealing with her problems.", "NTA.\n\nYour instincts are 100% correct; if they want to talk, it's on them to initiate that, not on somebody else to force them to talk.\n\nThat said, I'm wondering if she has a crush on you, because this sort of push/pull is very common in immature people trying to express interest and invite attention.", "NTA, your \"friend\" seems like the type of person who needs to hear  'If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.'", "op=NTA\n\nThis person is an emotional vampire.  They want you to beg them to share their feelings, to give them all this focus--it's an ego boost.\n\nIf you look back, you will probably see a pattern that it is always about what she's feeling and doing and that you get talked over if you try to talk about yourself(which is probably not often as you say you don't like people prying in your life).", "NTA. I applaud you for not buying into that immaturity", "LMFAO I like the vay you think", "NTA - Life is too short for those games.  \n\nUnderlying all this is the concept of consent.  You asked if she was ok, she said she had stuff going on, you asked if she wanted to talk, she said no.  A \u2018no\u2019 response means the topic is dropped.  She did not give consent for you to pry into her life, you respected the boundary she firmly established, and she got mad because you treated her with respect. Except she wanted you to push, push, and pull it out of her (attention seeking behavior) so she could finally \u2018open up\u2019 (need for validation). \n\nPosting to TikTok like that is very juvenile and passive aggressive. She\u2019s doing it for validation and attention. Don\u2019t feed the beast.  Honestly the friendship sounds one sided.", "NTA, listen I totally understand that as her friend you want the best for her, but as someone who was the therapist friend, if possible try to limit communication. \n\nA friendship should go both ways with people communicating and supporting each other, not one of them complaining they are alone while you try to reach out and feel anxious something bad might have happened.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if you want to keep the line open for her to reach out, but in the end everyone is responsible for their own issues, you can be supportive but don\u2019t become their punching bag!", "NTA. Make tour own tiktoks and say badically thr same thing. Or gice her direct responses to her questions there", "NTA. Drama queen,  not so much.", "NTA what does she want you to do, waterboard her?", "NTA- I had a friend like this in high school. It\u2019s been a peaceful 25 years without her. I say enjoy the freedom.", "I think most of us have known someone like this. You know, they public post on Facebook \u201cI\u2019m broken\u201d - then don\u2019t reply to their friends\u2019 concerned queries.  You are correct: don\u2019t play this childish game", "NTA\n\nShe sounds exhausting. Going NC seems to be the best course of action.", "NTA - She's wearing me out and I don't even know her.", "NTA\n\nYou can't fix her. She'll have to sort herself out eventually. Ignore her. Move on. \n\n> She said I'm an AH for not understanding\n\nWhat is there to understand other than that she is a drama llama and you are not a drama llama farmer.", "NTA  I can't stand this kind of attenton seeking.  It is draining for all around her, and no wonder if people give up on her.  When does she ever ask if you are OK? I often find these people seemed deluded into thinking they are always there for people and no one is for them, but it is their own doing and they are so self absorbed that actually people are scared to ask because they know it will be a huge emotional drain to drag out the full story.", "That's the thing about relationship tests, both people can fail because friendship is not hierarchical.  \n\nThe friend was trying to make a point to OP and test her friendship (and her ability to read her mind?), but in the process she proved that she was a bad friend to OP.", "vShe\u2019s playing mind games with you and is trying to play the victim because you can\u2019t read her mind.", "The relationship test. I hadn't thought of this that way, but you're right. That's exactly what it was. Time to grow up indeed.", "Consent and boundaries are the underlying issues here.  The friend didn\u2019t give OP consent to pry and OP respected those boundaries.  OP is a good friend. \n\nIt reminds me of how I finally lost a really good friend. I had already put distance between us over other massive issues, but the constant boundary stomping is what caused me to cut all ties with her and that group of friends. No is a perfectly acceptable answer, it doesn\u2019t mean pester me for 30 minutes non stop until you get your way.", "Ooh I read 16 year old friend, not friend of 16 years!", "Ze vay, surely?", "SAME, I was like yeah teen drama.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA but is it possible your friend has depression, or some kind of trauma that's hard to talk about? She's not being fair and reasonable, but with only the context you provided, it sounds like she might be struggling with something she can't make sense of, or let herself say. Like she wants you to drag it out of her. That's NOT your job, but it might be good to let someone know that you think she needs some help. Maybe talk to someone in her family, or another friend? At any rate, trying to alert someone to see past her annoying behavior to what's really driving her is the decent thing to do. I think it would be best if you did hand it off to someone else - if there is a problem, and she gets help, she might need your friendship again down the line.", "NTA. Life is too short for this BS.", "NTA, social Networks are making people act insane (and just for attention), it's all so scary.", "Relationship tests are also absurdly common on tiktok and facebook, so using tiktok and facebook as your relationship test seems on brand in the worst way.", "Some people's needs clash and you can either try to complement and fulfill the other person's needs or discuss that this is not something that is feasible for either of you without insulting one another. Choosing whichever option would not make her an AH, but she became an AH when she insulted her friend after the latter admitted to needing a different approach for her needs to be fulfilled compared to OP. \n\nOn the other hand, her friend is also TA for actually playing games by going on social media to try to force her hand before she clearly stated what she needed. \n\nSo, to recap, while OP is definitely less of TA than her friend, I personally agree with the judgement of ESH *(with the cavit of her being less shitty than her friend)* as OP needs to accept that different people have different needs (i.e., be more open minded) and her friend needs to grow up, be more assertive and clearer in what she needs from others."]}
