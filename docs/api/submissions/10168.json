She is a phlebotomist that only works part time and never finished her college classes because time and money\u2026She rents a 2b/1b with the three boys sharing one room and two beds. She doesn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t pay her own electric bill, afford a babysitter, or buy her own groceries outright without food stamps. Between her parents, and me and my wife, she always has someone to watch her kids for free. There have been multiple occasions where my wife would have to call into work so we could watch her boys, along with our now 2y/o, even when we weren\u2019t in the best financial situation ourselves. The boys have never been anywhere special. We bought her gift to give one of her boys for his birthday as well as the one from us\u2026 and the list could go on. Now none of these things by themselves is a problem, it\u2019s takes a village as they say. I\u2019m also just laying this out to give understanding to her situation. \n  Well, unlike her parents(my in laws), we never once have asked or expected anything in return, as it should be for family.

Considering how she went out of her way to call me and tell me this, I told her how I felt that the money is meant to be used for her children, and it\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t need the money to care for them to the fullest extent. I brought up how the oldest is constantly wearing shoes too small because he is growing so quick, all the times people have come out of pocket or missed out on money to take care of her kids, as well as everything I stated above\u2026 turns out I\u2019m a hater because I think her children are more important than her tits. I was told I should be happy for her because she is getting to \u201ctreat herself\u201d for being a single mom.

So it might turn out all right in the end. /s. Of course the kids should come first, especially if their basic needs are not met. Like clothes that fit.", "NTA, but as long as y\u2019all keep bailing her ass out, she is never going to figure out how to be responsible with her money. You might need to marinate on that with your wife and the inlaws and figure out a way to help the children, but not the SIL who hasn\u2019t figured out how to \u201cadult\u201d yet\u2026", "**NTA**\n\nThe issue here isn't that you're sticking your nose into someone else's business for fun. The issue is that you're legitimately concerned that your SIL is spending thousands of dollars on plastic surgery when she hasn't been able to afford to care for your nephews properly or consistently up until now. \n\nAnd no one is saying that she shouldn't treat herself. But as someone who lives in poverty myself: when you are asking others to contribute financially (and the equivalent in time and effort) to your household on a regular basis, \"treating yourself\" means buying yourself a cute new top that maybe you couldn't normally afford. Or ordering takeout from a nice restaurant because you never get to do that. *It absolutely does not mean blowing THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS* on plastic surgery. \n\nThe plain truth is that your SIL is incredibly financially irresponsible, and apparently so is your wife. If I were you, BEFORE she spends that tax return, I would tell her point blank: \"I'm very happy for you that your financial situation has improved. Given that you have so much money to spend on 'treating yourself', I guess we can assume going forward that you will no longer need any financial assistance from us. Really happy for you that you're doing so well.\"\n\nYou are NTA, but make it clear that you aren't going to be her bank if this is how she's going to spend her money.", "I\u2019m confused, what makes the distinction between \u201cvery\u201d single, and just plain old regular single?", "NTA I\u2019m there with you buddy. She\u2019s being irresponsible with money that could help the kids and her. Boob jobs aren\u2019t life long and have to eventually be redone. Sadly her kids will always be second place. She needs to be getting money from the dad(s).", "NTA. I mean... She has children??? Of course I get the wanting to treat yourself, but that would be like a spa weekend with friends away from the for a lil while. Not an entire boob-job? However, if she does go through with it, don't pay anything for her. At least that'd be ideal, but the kids would suffer I guess.", "NTA", "I reckon if you went looking then you'd find other instances where SIL buys herself something nice, or extravagant,  or unnecessary.... because she can use the kids as a bank to get what she needs for them out of her family.   \n\nFor a tax cheque that large she sounds like she could be earning enough to care for her kids needs herself if she chose to.  But again... why should she choose when her family will prop her up.\n\nSo boob jobs only last 10-15 years.  What then?  That's best case scenario.   You'll never win this one. No matter how right you are... and you are. As you say,  you'll always be the outsider here.  You're going to have to choose how to live with this for a very long time.  Without even saying 'I told you so' at the end of it all.", "NTA", "INFO: How much is her tax return?", "Nta.\n\nKids come first. I'm not saying she can't get a boob job but making sure the kids have clothes that fit, bills are paid, and you can manage your debts with your wage, then you can do personal stuff.", "NTA. But it's time to have a financial/time management conversation with your wife. You need to have a discussion about how your own family could be better off, but you aren't because of all the money and time put into her sister's family. That *you* don't have the financial power to make luxury choices and purchases, but her sister believes she does. If her sister has that ability, her sister clearly does not require the help the family thinks she does. Be clear that your wife can continue to support her sister with *her own* resources, but family/shared resources need to be discussed *before* any decision is made. This includes buying things for the children, giving her money for utilities, or taking days off work to care for her children (which is a financial hit for your own family). Perhaps also bring up the idea that maybe babysitting won't be completely without compensation, sometimes she's going to have to provide babysitting for you, sometimes she's going to have to provide for her children while they're in your care.\n\nShe can have her augmentation, but she also needs to live with the fact that her children are going without and she's making financial decisions based on support that is not guaranteed.", "NTA and she is can do what she wants and you can decide your not a atm! She doesn\u2019t need to worry because you will pick up the slack.", "NTA\n\nThat a woman doesn\u2019t have her priorities in the right place. Stop giving her money.

Maybe if she changed that she could afford shoes?\n\nNTA", "NTA - besides the issues with your SIL - you need to sit down with your wife and have a very long talk about what is important in life.

There might be more to it than simply wanting big boobs, but I\u2019m just playing devils advocate. I\u2019d like to hope a mother wouldn\u2019t put that over her children\u2019s needs.

Treating herself doesn't mean she has to use the entire return on herself - and boob jobs require maintenance. Will she have the money for that later on?", "NTA, but your wife kind of is for supporting this nonsense. Basic needs for her kids should absolutely be your SILs priority.

You can have an opinion though.", "YTA. Not every opinion needs to be shared. Like you said, it\u2019s not your business. It has nothing to do with \u201csociety today.\u201d Her money.

She should make sure her children have the correct size clothing/shoes before worrying about her breast size.", "Yeah feeling attractive is definitely the priority when your kids don\u2019t have clothes or shoes that fit.", "What she may or may not have leftover for her children after her tits shouldn\u2019t be in question comforting all the financial responsibilities she already doesn\u2019t fulfill. I am very well aware of what breastfeeding does as my wife did it. All her kids were bottle fed, not that that constitutes how deminished her confidence is, a mothers feelings, while important, do not justify this.", "See this is where my brain went because I know a few girls who started with a boob job after 3 kids and became a stripper. \n\nMy question is where\u2019s dad in this situation at the minimum he should be paying child support for the boys.", "Then you need to shut down bank rolling her bad habits. When your ask for money tell them if she has money for plastic surgery then she has money to pay the light bill. What little extra you have will be going into a savings account for YOUR child.", "That actually makes a lot of sense. I have a couple friends/relatives who are divorced and love to complain about how hard it is to be a single mom...but they're getting child support and the fathers are heavily involved in coparenting. So while they're unmarried, they have a lot of support. \n\nOne of my friends has two ex-husbands, and two children with the first one. Her first ex remarried a super nice woman who treated her stepchildren as her own, and they love her, then the ex and the second wife divorced and she later remarried. The children still visited (they're grown and in college now) her and her new husband and child. My friend's second husband also remarried and the children get along well with his wife and their children as well. So basically, my friend got child support from husband #1, alimony from husband #2 (and my friend did NOT marry poor men), and she had three households where her children had their own bedrooms and are always welcome (actually the kids are in their 20s now and still have bedrooms in four different households. Any time she wanted a night out or a weekend away or any time alone whatsoever for whatever reason, someone was more than happy to take the kids. When my kids were younger I used to honestly be a little jealous of her freedom, and then to hear her complain so often about how hard it was to be a single mom made it even worse. But I don't know, maybe it was hard for her, I'm not her so I can't really say. I did kind of feel bad for the kids, having to shuffle around so much, but they seemed to be pretty happy with the situation.", "Something that also just occurred to me is her recovery. I'm guessing she's not going to be able to care for herself *or* the children for a while after surgery. Make sure that you aren't the plan for care.\n\nGood luck!", "Actually everyone wants to feel desirable. You maybe ok looking and feeling like shit but most people don't.", "She\u2019s never got any cash from me lmao. Her dad and step mom pay her electric.", "You may be ok with being a shitty neglectful parent, but most people aren\u2019t.", "Lol you\u2019re seriously saying it\u2019s fine and dandy to buy yourself a boob job when you can\u2019t properly clothe or house your three kids? What are you, a former guest on the Maury show or something?", "Doesn't that surgery require like 6 weeks of almost total bedrest? Who looks after the kids then? And how does she make money for food or rent?"]}
