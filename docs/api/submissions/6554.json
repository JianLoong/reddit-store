Honestly I don't get why the person who buys the tickets should split it with the person they bought it from that doesn't make much sense.\n\n\nBut you didn't actually pay for the tickets unless you and your boyfriend share an account. The only reason I am saying NTA is because you have some agreed upon deal where half the tickets are yours making it somewhat tantamount to a gift. I think really you should just think about if you and bf switched positions you bought the tickets and gave him half would expect him to split it with you? It is easy to so no to that but be honest with yourself. \n\nTo avoid situations like this in the future any time you are dealing with a shared lottery and prize be clear up front about how or if there should be a split, I will also say splitting tickets is pretty stupid it is only going to cause resentment.

What\u2019s THEIR situation? Does she even love them to ask and hear? Don\u2019t have to pay for it but c\u2019mon. I\u2019d share a lottery ticket if I\u2019m wealthy and they\u2019re this in need - or at least pause to ask.\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said of being conscious and not waste money, and acting like certain people don\u2019t deserve etc. when they genuinely have less and need it. \n\nIt maybe the post of course, length, details, it just the attitude seemed compassionless.\n\nI get she was raised differently. But what is OP doing now, that people notice her money and think she\u2019s not fair/stingy to them? 150k is a lot, not sure if OP told them about the bike gifts or that\u2019s made up after to feel good and justify not doing it. Idk \n\nI also know some people who have wealth and raised humble tend to think it\u2019s the same as not having wealth - and call it entitlement if someone needs support. Is OP tone deaf?\n\nHer husband wanted to do 50/50. Why\u2019s it her parents ways only and that\u2019s ignored?\n\nWhil OP did not do anything wrong, her attitude is not inspiring trust in me. Toying with others hardships, when they\u2019re literally crying she is busy wondering to take back bike \u2018thoughts\u2019. No empathy. \n\nWho does that for money? All the time? I\u2019d be curious what they ARE going through. It reads like OP could be totally extravagant and actually only thrifty with them, I have no info to suggest what they say to OP besides how she interprets it. Hence my hesitations - not doing anything has consequences too depending what you\u2019re enabling.\n\nLastly, OP doesn\u2019t seem to care what her niblings get. What do the family gift each other?? Her? Does she ever be kind because she can or what\u2019s the issue in considering anyone else, besides saying that\u2019s what my parents did? Why\u2019s the husband willing to share, and isn\u2019t it a marital asset?\n\nIt\u2019s not my place to derail or interrogate an OP. All I\u2019m saying is all the adults are acting horribly in front of the kids. Regardless why. Talk to each other. Don\u2019t flaunt. No petty. I just hope OP rethinks it", "Might have been a raffle.", "150k is a fact school raffle prize.", "That's fine. You engaged with my replies so I'm happy that things got resolved between us. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nThe downvoters who don't say anything about what they don't like about a comment they downvote (nor even upvote in agreement someone else's clear contrary reply to the comment) have both the hearts and skills of chickens. Pecking at the up/downvote icons is all they apparently can do.\n\nSo I really do appreciate replies that say something, and even appreciate further when replied back with clarification. Whether I end up being right or wrong, it's way better than silent downvotes. Thank you. \ud83d\ude0a", "Thank you as well. Nice to have a conversation with an intelligent person."]}
