Usually it\u2019s around big holidays etc. we have a Christmas lottery. Something many schools sell. \n\nMy bf and I have been together for 13 years and we are happily childfree. We have good incomes and comfortable living. My bf\u2019s sister and her husband also have good incomes and comfortable living but I feel sometimes that she always tries to hint that we make more than we spend because we don\u2019t have children (no shit Sherlock) and that maybe we should give more presents and stuff to her two sons. I don\u2019t agree. I put around 30-60 euros on a present and whether it\u2019s good or bad I don\u2019t care. I come from money (well my parents had good jobs) but we learned from young age that it\u2019s never the value of the present. And I had the happiest upbringing. \n\nAnyway, the sons get a couple of dozens or more lotteries each to sell and the idea is to go around the neighborhood etc. but they\u2019re too lazy and they make the family buy everything and since my bf and I \u201chave nothing important to spend money on\u201d we end up buying the majority of the tickets. Around 200-300 euros worth each occasion. It pissed me off a bit in the beginning but my bf seemed uncomfortable saying no and I hate making him uncomfortable so I said oh well. \n\nThis Christmas I won about 150K euros. I was so happy because I never win stuff. When the nephews heard this they wanted \u201ctheir ticket back\u201d I was shocked and said f*ck no! They called me like 50 times and my bf\u2019s sister and her sons showed up next morning to talk then argue then fight me. Then she asked to at least split it 50/50 with them but I wouldn\u2019t budge. All three left in tears saying they will take me to court. My bf wants me to split or I\u2019m being an ah. I usually donate 20% of my bonuses, inheritance or any big chunk of money I get to charity. I thought I would do that and buy the boys the bicycles they we\u2019re saving for (cost around 2500 each I don\u2019t know why) but now I won\u2019t even buy them the bicycles. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: my bf is the one who pays for the tickets.

I am not sure what the laws are in your country but if this were in the United States I would say to them \"see you in court\".\n\nAnd for everyone saying that your BF is showing red flags by encouraging you to split the money, he is probably in a VERY difficult position with his family putting pressure on him, so I would not take this as a sign of his potential to be loyal to you. Anytime there is a large sum of money and family involved, things are going to get very difficult to navigate. He may just be trying to play peacemaker.", "NTA.\n\nEntitlement kills.

Wtf?", "There are usually rules in place so that the person selling the tickets cannot win. That way there is no cheating.

Cash it, put it on your account and never speak of it again even when they bring it up. Invest it and when they come begging for money say there's no more, all gone bc you don't keep cash rotting in a bank. You can tell the boys to choose a bike as thank you for the ticket, within 1k limit or something.

Honestly I don't get why the person who buys the tickets should split it with the person they bought it from that doesn't make much sense.\n\n\nBut you didn't actually pay for the tickets unless you and your boyfriend share an account. The only reason I am saying NTA is because you have some agreed upon deal where half the tickets are yours making it somewhat tantamount to a gift. I think really you should just think about if you and bf switched positions you bought the tickets and gave him half would expect him to split it with you? It is easy to so no to that but be honest with yourself. \n\nTo avoid situations like this in the future any time you are dealing with a shared lottery and prize be clear up front about how or if there should be a split, I will also say splitting tickets is pretty stupid it is only going to cause resentment. Just say you both get half the money if one of you wins, so much simpler. \n\nAs far as the nephews they can get stuffed, they sold the tickets they aren't entitled to anything.", "Nope, NTA\n\nYou bought the tickets, you won.\n\nThey had their option and chances to win if they wanted to contribute\n\nParents were already being greedy and entitled", "I guess you should never buy lottery tickets from these children again \n\nWhy would they expect (not even just ask, but demand) a share of the winnings when they never once offered to pay a share of the losses?\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Then if he wants to give his share away, that's his choice.", "Family over ho*s anytime", "Do you don\u2019t think the SIL is being an AH for showing up at their house demanding money and threatening to go to the police to steal the ticket \u201cback\u201d?", "We have shared and private accounts but there\u2019s rarely talk about my and your money.
