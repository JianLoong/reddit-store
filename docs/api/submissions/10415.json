She has always been a little on the bigger side, but over the course of the last year she has gained a lot of weight. We have been talking recently about starting a family seeing as her and I both have been wanting a child but werent financially stable until now. My wife has diabetes, and so she goes to the doctor regularly. This past time (about a month ago) we asked about how what chances would be if we were to try and get pregnant. The doctor told her in order to do that safely and successfully she would need to lose atleast 70 lbs. She cried on the way home saying she didn't want to work out and change her diet and that we should just give up having kids forever. I told her adoption was an option and she shut it down saying she wanted a child that she birthed. The conversation continued minorly after we got home, her saying how she wouldn't be able to do it and she wanted to have a baby before she was 40. I told her she needed to lose that weight and get healthy, because if she didn't we couldn't have a baby successfully and I even offered to help her and said we could wait a year so that she could take it slow. She instantly snapped at me, accusing me of saying she was fat and saying that I wouldn't love her anymore if we didn't have a child, which i've never said. I was simply stating what the doctor told her, which was that she needed to lose weight. We talked it out, and everything was fine. The conversation didn't come up again until today. \n\nMy wife works nights at a gas station and i work 5 days a week. She's been telling me daily for the past 3 weeks that between 11am-2 pm, she's been at the gym working out, but didn't understand why she wasn't losing weight. She even cut her diet back, and seemed to be doing well. Today though, I went to a caf\u00e9 on my lunch break around 12 close to my work that i've never been to before, and I saw my wife inside the caf\u00e9 with cookies, cake, and baked goods on the table in front of her. After confronting her, she told me she had been lying about going to the gym and came to this caf\u00e9 everyday to eat, and this caused a HUGE argument. She told me I was selfish for wanting her to change her body just to have a kid and that I didn't love her if I wouldn't accept that she didn't want to lose weight.", "created_utc": 1676850821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116s0gv/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_needs_to_lose_weight/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife needs help to process what is happening. Get her to a therapist or a counselor. Right now she is being confronted possibly never having a child, her husband possibly leaving her because of it, having to make drastic lifestyle changes - she has a lot of shit rolling around in her head right now. \n\nYou can be supportive of her by getting her some help. Right now you have a very cut and dry thing going. \"Dr. says lose weight to have a baby, so she just needs to lose weight.\"\n\nIt just does not work that way. Especially since you say she has always carried some extra weight. I don't think there is an asshole here. But, I think that could very easily change with your next argument. Get her and yourself to counseling so you can get the tools you need to navigate all of the change that is being thrown at her.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not being overly pushy or shaming her, so i find it very concerning that she\u2019s lying about her whereabouts to eat food in secret. I think her eating habits are a symptom of something bigger.", "NTA.\nIt seems to me that you are just presenting the facts and options to her as they are. \nIt sounds like she has an unhealthy relationship with food and turns to that for comfort. She will have to want to get better emotionally and lose weight for herself and until that happens I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any true effort.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like she is upset with what the doctor said and rather than take it for what it is - a health issue - she is deciding to make it about everything other than the truth. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to hear you\u2019re overweight and that weight can impact your life. But it\u2019s the truth. Based on her \u201ccheating\u201d during the day, it sounds like she has either a binge eating disorder or unhealthy relationship with food. \n\nA counselor would be helpful, but having that conversation is likely going to start a fight. It\u2019s up to you if you want to ignore the problem, or deal with the discomfort. Good luck", "I will say that I had to have gastric bypass and lose 160 pounds before I could get pregnant. And it wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t try other ways - I had (have) an eating disorder and insulin resistance. I\u2019m not saying she should have gastric bypass, but she should talk seriously with a doctor about what she has going on.", "NTA, she urgently needs therapy. Being overweight already causes a problem to have babies, but you mentioned that she have diabetes, even if you don't want to have a baby in the future, bad eating habits are like a time bomb for this disease (diabetes is not a joke). I feel that you have given her options such as adopting (she didn't want it), losing weight calmly (she didn't want it) you have done your best. She doesn't seem very convinced about having a baby either \"I want it but I don't want it\". The eating problems are serious, metabolic problems are serious, if she is eating secretly It's because she can't contain herself and she could possibly be linked to the emotional problems. Communication, patience, doctors and therapy, OP.", "NAH. I was about to go NTA, but since your wife appears to have an eating disorder, I can't call her TA either. Since a person who has an illness has to want to get better, to have any chance of improving, there isn't much you can do to encourage her to deal with whatever is underlying the unhealthy eating. Even diabetes isn't enough encouragement. Looks like so long as the two of you are together, children aren't happening.", "NTA\n\nYou wife needs therapy before she thinks of having a child. She is trying to turn this around on you when she knows that it is all on her to lose weight if she wants a child. She is the one who want to have a baby before 40, she will not entertain any alternatives(adoption) and she is the one who has been lying to herself about losing weight, while lying to you. She is gaslighting you.\n\nJust tell her that you are fine not having a child if she is unable to lose the weight. It is all in her hands now.", "Me reading the title: you're awful\nMe reading the rest: NTA, and your wife sounds like she needs a LOT of therapy", "NTA. It sounds like she has binge eating disorder and needs therapy", "NTA\u2026it sounds like there\u2019s something more going on with her. If she\u2019s eating like that as a diabetic she is putting herself on the fast track to blindness, amputations, etc.", "NTA. You just can\u2019t win with your wife. She wants kids, she wants to give up on having kids, when presented with the option of adoption, she insists on having biological children, she accuses you of not loving her if you two don\u2019t have kids, she decides to lose weight, she lies about trying to lose weight and turns it back to blaming you for what she claims she wants. And if anybody thinks she\u2019d see a therapist without throwing that in your face too, they\u2019re only fooling themselves. Do you really want this to be the next 40+ years of your life?", "NTA \nIt sounds like your wife is really struggling with coming to grips with an eating disorder which is rough but it's not like you're fat shaming or making fun of her. \n\nShe has an addiction and has been lying to you for weeks to cover up that rather than take care of herself she'd prefer to be dishonest and put her health and your shared goals at risk. \n\nMaybe try to help her get a nutritional coach and or a therapist. You seem like a loving partner who'd prefer to have a living wife to love.", "NTA as person who has been overweight most their life and only recently lost a lot of weight, it does hurt when being confronted about losing weight especially from doctors because they usually aren't they nicest when talking about weight issue but she's obviously taking it out on you and then eating her feelings (I too an gility of this) biggest thing you can do is not go cold turkey as going from a ton of junk food to 0 will always fail try to limit junk food rather then eliminate it", "NTA there is something deeper going on here.", "NTA. This is a sad, sad situation but unfortunately your wife is in no condition to be a mother right now. No matter how much she insists that she wants a baby. First, physically. Obviously she can\u2019t and she doesn\u2019t want to. But most importantly, mentally and emotionally. If she\u2019s diabetic and overweight, and the mere recommendation from a doctor to lose weight sets her back, and she hides to eat, that shows that she\u2019s not well. If she really wants to be a mom, she\u2019d set herself that goal to be healthy first for herself, then for her child. She can\u2019t. Therapy and more therapy would be my suggestion because it really works. It a switch doesn\u2019t happen inside of her, nothing will change.", "NTA. If she had decided for sure that she didn't want a child and you had said \"you should lose weight so we can have a baby\" it'd be an AH move but based on what you've said, you all were having a two-way conversation where both of you want to have a baby, and her losing the weight is the only way forward to do that safely, you weren't calling her fat you were trying to find a way forward to meet your goals.\n\nAnd on top of that, she's lying to you and accuses you of being controlling when you get mad for lying - if she doesn't want to lose the weight that's completely her decision but good relationships are built on trust and she broke it. Massively. Sounds like there's something deeper here", "NTA. You parroted what her doctor said. And she clearly has a serious problem with food that she can't control and should seek professional help for. \n\nSerious question though, do you really want to have a kid with a woman who lied to you for months and has absolutely no control over her eating habits? Because that's not going to bode well for your potential child(ren), as her inability to control herself is definitely going to be passed down to them.", "NTA. Whether to have a child or not is a big decision. If she's unwilling to make the changes needed to do so safely, that can absolutely factor in to whether or not you wish to remain in the relationship. Does she actually want a child? If not, that's ok, but if you do, there may be a compatibility issue.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t know if anyone is going to point out that if she won\u2019t start making some better choices, the bulk of raising a child will fall to you, because either she\u2019ll be sick or dead.  I\u2019m no doctor, but I wouldn\u2019t throw the dice on having a child with someone who doesn\u2019t care at all about their health.  When you\u2019re taking care of this kid all by yourself, you will resent her.", "NTA\n\nYour wife clearly isn't going to change herself. Not on her own at least. She lied to you just so she could sneak out and eat sweets.\n\nShe wants kids, but she doesn't want to lose weight, and she doesn't want to adopt. She needs to realize she can't have it both ways. If she doesn't change herself, you need to decide if not having children is a deal breaker.", "NTA.\n\nLook, I get it, nobody wants to hear \"you have to lose weight\", \"you've gained weight\", \"you're not as attractive as you could be / as you used to be\". **Nobody** wants to hear that.\n\nBut sometimes it's better to just tell the truth. I have a policy with my friends and family - I always tell the truth if they ask me my opinion. Even if it's going to hurt them. (Notice **\\*if they ask me\\***).  \nI do it because I **care**. I could say what they wanted to hear - but what's the point in that? I look at it this way: if it hurts them then it **shows that I care**. I could just take the easy way out and say something nice. But since I care I would rather be honest. I believe it will help them more. In fact, most of the time when this happens they get upset with me at first - but once they get over their initial reaction they always want to continue the discussion because they realise I said what I said **for their sake**.\n\nOkay, then.  \nWith all that in mind, you are not an a\\*\\*hole for wanting the best for your wife, even if it hurts her to hear you say those things.\n\nShe says she wants kids. Her **own** kids. Not adoption. But she also says that **you** are selfish for saying what the doctor already told her.  \nSHE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being overweight. As long as you're healthy. But if your doctor says that your weight is a concern then *it* ***is*** *a concern.* It's not just about looks. It's not just about people's opinions. It's about your **life.** Yours and hers both. She has to realise that health issues affects not just her but her partner and children as well.\n\n**The real concern** for me is, why is this so hard for her? If she really wants children, why can't she do this? It sounds like she hasn't really given it a chance. She has to make up her mind about what it really is that she wants.  \nThere could be a lot of factors at play here. Low self esteem. Possible depression. Other mental health issues - possibly directly related to her physical health.  \nAsk her what it would take for her **to want to get better**. **To want to get healthy.**  \nIs it really not worth giving it a try for a chance to have kids? If that's really what she wants?  \nWhy is she lying about going to the gym? Possible sign of denial and / or addiction. Why does she eat to begin with? Is there pain in her life? Most of us know that eating disorders are often a way to mask some other pain / issues. Is her worklife an issue? Working nights at a low end job can easily be course for mental struggles and low self esteem.  \nJust from her work situation alone I would guess that she might feel stuck, incompetent, \"lesser\", stupid, a failure, or something else. You should ask her about how she **feels** in a general sense.\n\nI wish for the two of you that you figure this out. That you maybe involve a therapist.  \nBeing overweight is not an issue on it's own. Not having kids is not an issue.  \nBut all of these underlying things that could be present along with her weight and her diabetes ***has to be taken seriously.***  \nHer life is not just her own. Not when she's chosen to get married. You are partners. Each of you affect the other as well.", "NTA. She's been told what needs to be done and just refuses to listen. That's on her, not you.", "NTA.", "NAH.\n\nIf your wife is lying about and hiding eating, as well as (?) projecting feelings onto you about how she thinks you feel about her weight, being she may be grappling with an eating disorder (and possibly not know it).\nEither way there are underlying issues that she needs to address about why she felt the need to hide it/lie to you.\n\nI\u2019m sure you were trying to be helpful with suggestions of how to lose weight etc., but that almost always comes across as pushing, and people start questioning whether that\u2019s coming from a place of concern, dissatisfaction, etc.\nAs her husband, your opinion is going to carry more weight (no pun intended), so reassuring her that you love her as she is/aren\u2019t going anywhere, and that the only reason you encouraged/pushed the idea of her losing weight was because you thought that was the best change of having a kid will go a long way. \n\nSide note: \nIME doctors are quick to jump on the \u201cyou need to lose weight to do xyz successfully\u201d bandwagon. Would it be healthier/lower risk to be at a lower weight? Sure, but smaller odds of conceiving isn\u2019t the same as it being totally out of the question. If you\u2019d been actively trying and nothing was happening, that\u2019d be a different story, but from what you said, you haven\u2019t done that yet. So if it\u2019s what you both want, and you both understand the associated risks etc., maybe have a talk about whether you\u2019re both willing to accept the risks and go from there. At this stage you don\u2019t only have 2 options in front of you (I.e. she lose weight or no kids ever), you have several options, and it sounds like you both need to discuss those options too.", "NTA. She\u2019s insecure about her weight, which is fine but all you did is repeat what the doctor said.", "NTA. As we all know, the truth can hurt. She needs to come to terms with the truth- that if she wants to get pregnant, she needs to lose weight. Her lying to you, calling you selfish, accusing you of thinking she\u2019s fat, etc, is her avoiding the real issue.   \n  \nWhat it comes down to is how badly does she want a baby. It\u2019s unhealthy and I\u2019ll even say selfish to purposely not lose the weight that a Dr says you need to lose, before conceiving and continuing a pregnancy. She\u2019s already diabetic. She needs to listen to her Dr.", "NTA for what you\u2019ve described but you and your wife would both be huge assholes if you actually had a kid at this stage.

Losing weight is just as much done in the kitchen as the gym. If your wife doesn't want a baby and you do, this is not going to work. A baby is not something you can compromise on.", "ESH, maybe she doesn't want a baby that much and maybe you need to back off her.", "YTA. You fat shamed your wife, and maybe there is another reason why she doesn\u2019t want to lose weight. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to have your baby.

Amazing.", "Just because your wife has a drinking issue (based on your AITA post) doesn't mean you get to accuse me of being the reason my wife overeats. She's been heavier set since she was a child. it was HER decision to have a baby, she brought it up way before i ever did. I think YTA here.", "I guess you are unaware of how risky pregnancy is in diabetic overweight people. Try reading up on preeclampsia.", "Did I say that?        \nThe woman in question has diabetes. Skimming over her health problems by saying 'I got pregnant at near 300lbs' is totally ignoring her particular issues.      \n  It's not just as easy as 'I'm obese and I got pregnant'           \nLike good for you, but her issue is that her Dr has told her not to get pregnant at her weight, and here you come like 'I did and I was fine'         \nThat's not helpful, and at worst could be dangerous.      \nSo yeah, flexing that YOU got pregnant while significantly overweight is not at all relevant or helpful to op.          \nBut sure, make out I said you shouldn't exist.      \nCheck your insecurity, darlin.", "This isn\u2019t my place for judgement. I\u2019m sorry to break it to you, but a woman of that age shouldn\u2019t be consuming so much. If you had better control at home, and maybe buy some healthier food options or snacks AT HOME, it could help out a ton! You want to be a parent, but can\u2019t even make sure your wife eats healthy!", "That\u2019s so unfair. OP literally just detailed how she is lying about where she went to eat. He\u2019s trying to be supportive of her; he\u2019s suggested weightloss and getting healthy, but he also needs to tread carefully as to not SHATTER her self esteem. You shouldn\u2019t have to parent/police your partner\u2019s eating.", "You\u2019re bringing the wrong things here. \n\nHe is supporting his wife in her decision to have children. He isn\u2019t forcing anything. Take your unrealized anger somewhere else.", "Again, she's been overweight her entire life and i married her like that because I love her. We are an ingredient household, and I make dinner every night, a healthy dinner. I work 5 days a week, from 6am to 6pm, so I cannot be home with her all of the time to watch what she is eating.", "She snuck out to eat food behind his back. What do you want him to do? Put a muzzle on her? He can't control her decisions.", "Sorry but your in no position to say anything to op about his relationship considering your wife is drinking while pregnant, you'd think she'd be more careful after having 2 miscarriages, maybe you should focus on your own relationship problems instead of commenting on others, if you had better control of your own home then maybe your wife wouldn't be drinking and putting the health of your unborn baby at risk.", "That is an incredibly controlling perspective, and gives some insight as to why your own wife didn't initially come clean about having a couple drinks. Being worried and helpful is one thing; parenting and controlling your spouse to the point of not letting them eat what they want is ridiculous.", "You should be helping each other as a team. If you want this baby so bad you have to put your wife in place. It\u2019s a team effort. Or just have a baby now\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f they\u2019ll give her a c section", "Huh?  It sounds like it is a team effort he\u2019s making the dinners and he works 6 AM to 6 PM. and what is this put his wife in place comment this isn\u2019t the 1950s. And you just think they\u2019re going to give her a C-section are you an MD lol", "Your comments in this thread are so ridiculous. I'm concerned for your wife if this is the kind of outlook and logic you go through your life with", "What do you mean by \"put her in her place\"?"]}
