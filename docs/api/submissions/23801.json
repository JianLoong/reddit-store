It's never a bad thing to tell someone the reality of possibly getting pregnant. That's an event that WILL change your life. \n\nI'm currently married and happily pregnant, but my 19 year old brother accidentally got a girl pregnant earlier this year. The story goes that he had asked if he needed to use protection (answer should always be yes), but that she'd said, \"No, you're good\" (or something like that). We think she might've done this on purpose -- she knew he had a job (but didn't realize it was $13/hr at walmart), knew he was taking college classes (but at a community college, which he has now dropped out of), and it seems to wants to avoid all other responsibilities in life. She's a high school dropout, has never had a job, no license, no ambition -- it seems she just wants to stay at home, let people give her money, live off food stamps, all while living with her dad, 1-2 brothers, and 3 dogs in an apartment. She refused to even consider taking classes to quickly earn her GED, and has been incredibly uncaring and immature about the whole pregnancy. I, on the other hand, have been keeping up with basic pregnancy/baby research I need to know and have consistently gone to the doctor. I'm over the moon about my rainbow miracle baby, and this chick acts like she barely cares about the life growing inside her.", "NTA. You're just trying to protect your friend.", "NTA - I also recently had to give someone very young, who doesn't have their life together, a reality check about having kids when they started going on about wanting them soon. No one should go into this mess unprepared and especially not while stuck in a min wage job situation, kids are soooo expensive.", "Define \u201creality check.\u201d  You\u2019re not wrong about the recklessness of his behavior or how inconsistent his thinking is, but how harshly was this phrased?", "NTA. And wow, Kyle needs some mental help. Maybe show them documentaries on the challenges of being a parent (partnered or not). \n\nAlso, are they assured of what they want? And what type of women are they desiring. \n\nI have so many other questions that are none of my business.", "NTA. Safe sex is always important and it is selfish to bring a child into a world where they won't be supported.", "NTA.  You are trying to protect your friend.  Kyle really needs to understand that he is in no position to have a child, considering he does not have his life together.  Life is extremely expensive without a child.  It's not fair to bring in a new life when you don't have your own together.", "NTA.  \n\nIt\u2019s really frustrating because wanting kids is such a strong biological response and no one ever is fully prepared for the toll it takes on finances, time, mental health, physical and the list goes on. It\u2019s probably an overwhelming feeling to want a kid for your friend.  \n\nIt\u2019s a really touchy subject and it might not be your place to tell him what he should and shouldn\u2019t do.  You risked telling him the truth as a friend to give him less hardships.   You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA-you are his emotional dumping ground, so he has opened himself up to unsolicited advice, and it is apparent that he is not in the right place to have a kid.\n\nMaybe it would be more helpful to explore why he wants kids when he is woefully unprepared. Encourage him to actually think about what the child\u2019s life would be like, and what his life would be like, in very concrete terms-like how much it would cost, how little time for himself he would have and how hard it is to date as a single parent.", "I\u2019ve been in this situation with a friend. It\u2019s super annoying and have told them many times the reality of the situation as well. Let you friend do their thing. If they have a kid, it\u2019s on them. Don\u2019t even try talking to them about it or anything. If they bring it up to complain, change the subject. NTA", "NTA !! What the .. why are people like this?? \nI\u2019m a mother of soon to be #2 and I knew before having kids that I wanted to find a good husband and father for them.. and have a decent life set up before bringing them into the world\nIt sounds like they are deeply troubled and have the belief a child will help them when the opposite is true in reality . People do not understand what it is like having kids until they have them. They can be challenging and if they are already struggling that will add fuel to the fire and that kid won\u2019t get the best start- it\u2019s unfair.", "NTA. sometimes people use sex and hook ups as a form of self harm, especially since he\u2019s not using protection whatsoever. i would intervene and talk to him, maybe there\u2019s a deeper issue going on.", "NTA\n\nYou warned him, as a friend who cares about him.\n\nWhen he doesn't listen (he won't), start being unavailable  for his drama.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA\n\nKyle's many issues are well above your paygrade. \n\nOf course he got upset with you. No one wants to be told that they're a hot mess. \n\nIt is your place to be there as a friend and point out when they're being a knob -- to a point. I think that point might be close at hand because the help Kyle needs is by a professional.", "as a transgender i can kind of see whats going on here. ive personally never had sex with a man. because of how terrified i am at the possibility. but acceptance is something i always strive for. i always feel scared and unsafe. so i am always looking for somewhere i feel like i belong because everything terrifies me. recently ive been just trying to get out of my house and out of my shell. because if im locked up for too long i get angsty and scared. but when i go outside i feel peace. its just i feel like i have always had to live my life luing because my truth was that i was trans and everyone used to tell me that \"i didnt know\" and that i was crazy but. you can always express your opinions. its just hard when people are going through things like that. you never know what someone might be going through.", "NTA. He's being irresponsible and as his friend, you're well within rights to look out for his best interest.", "NTA - Your friend sounds incredibly impulsive and probably needs help.  Getting the harsh truth hurts, but any friend worth their weight in gold will let you know when you're doing something irresponsible, even if it hurts.", "Here's the thing.. it totally depends on how it was worded. \n\nThere's a difference between being worried for a friend and explaining that to them, and telling them what to do and repeatedly making him feel upset by forcing your views on him. \n\nI can't say whether you're TA or not based on;\n\na) not knowing what you actually said and how hurtful it was\nb) whether you've been asked to stay out of it previously \nc) how close your friendship is", "NTA. Your friend Kyle seems to have a very distorted perception of things, as well as disregard for his own safety, which is VERY worrying.\n\nIt is not wrong to try giving some advice to your friends when they are about to commit some olympic stupidity. Especially if it affects him on the long run, and probably others too.\n\nActually, you did the right thing. Telling the person about the consequences... if this person decides to carry on or not, then that's their problem to deal with as you already did your part.\n\nHope Kyle wakes up and smells the coffee and stop playing that \"Hello, I'm Kyle and this is Jackass\" shit.\n\nWell, good luck I guess.", "Has he considered:\n\n\\- the physical toll pregnancy takes on the body?  the mental toll it takes during pregnancy and post-birth?  the financial hit of every single step from pregnancy to adulthood to raise a child?  the need to a safe and stable environment for the kiddo?  the mental health impacts of being pregnant and having a child as a transgender male (maybe he's thought through this and sees no mental stresses from being pregnant)?\n\nHe sounds super confused about what he wants in life. The worst thing in the world i to bring a child into this world and then try to figure out if you want it or if you want a life with kids.", "It sounds like he could use some serious therapy to help him figure out what he wants to do with his life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Caring about someone means telling them hard truths in a polite way sometimes.\n\nYou also are looking out for future baby as well. Once Kyle gets their stuff together, then a baby is more realistic.", "NTA. Someone has to be the \"bad guy\".", "NTA. Dude seriously underestimates how expensive the kids are. They are not plants, they are not pets, you can't just surrender them if you get tired of them. He did need to hear that.", "NTA\n\nKids are a MASSIVE commitment and if you aren't ready, it's not really going to be the life you want to give your kids.", "INFO: What was this \"reality check\"? And what makes you think it was not your place?\n\nMaybe NAH?\n\n1. I personally don't know how Kyle's sex life is makes him an asshole simply bc he's promiscuous. BC and condoms are not all 100% effective. He could have (valid) panic and concerns even if he were safe.\n2. Someone else's decision to have a kid is not yours. Many people with min wage can have children and care for children. Your reasons why he can't have kids are all monetary which is a part of raising a kid but unless it's an extreme situation simply 'You're too poor to have kids' is just condescending, fear mongering, and classist.", "NTA in my opinion \nSTDs from hookups could potentially be dangerous for your friend so I think that your concern is valid. Telling him your opinion in a calm way doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.", "I think some people unfortunately see a child as a 'this person will have to love me', instead of seeing a child as both an both an individual and the huge responsibility that they are.", "I\u2019m pretty sure he needs to stop hormones if he gets pregnant, if nothing else. \n\nAlso, his hips will widen and any residual breast tissue (assuming top surgery) will expand, and his facial features may soften, so he\u2019ll end up looking more feminine. This may lead to more accidental misgendering. Pregnancy feminizes the body. It\u2019s a huge amount of female hormones being shoved at the uterus.", "This !! So many people treat kids like a fashion accessory \u201coh a baby is so cute!!\u201d Until the baby isn\u2019t , until the baby poops all the way up it\u2019s back, screams at all hours of the night, grows into a child that tests your boundaries \n\nI love being a mother , but anyone who thinks it\u2019s easy to be a parent - probably isn\u2019t doing it right", "Look someone who doesn't have their shit together shouldn't be having unprotected sex. It's selfish and irresponsible especially when the person they risk having a baby with may not be around to help support the kid. Yes not all babies will be planned but why risk not being able to provide for your kid.\n\nYes poor people should be allowed to have kids but they like everyone else should be in a stable place before inviting the chaos of having a baby into their lives. I also didn't think this needed to be said in 2023, but while BC and condoms do not work 100% of the time they work alot more effectively than the pull out or creampie methods.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the money situation as such ; but their mental state .. they are clearly troubled and that is not a good starting point to have kids . \nAlso yeah, while people on min wage can- doesn\u2019t mean it is a good quality of life\nMy parents were dirt broke having me\nGood parents ? Sure \nBut I missed out on a lot \nI ensued that my life circumstances would be different before I had kids \nAnd now I am happy that if my daughter and if this baby want anything I can get it (within reason) \nThey aren\u2019t living independently, they are mentally struggling, they are having random hookups with no means of protection- this person needs therapy NOT a child.\nThese are important factors that need to be considered", "This could be the worst part, has he thought through what being pregnant will do to his body and his image? Especially if he ever had issues with body dysmorphia before.   \n\nSounds like he started sleeping with men again for a loneliness quick fix. A baby sounds like another bandaid solution", "yup, it is literally a changing of the entire body! and the mental aspect is so critical then! the pregnant person is important too, their mental wellbeing is so crucial. it isn't a minor thing to say \"eh whatever if i get pregnant, i get pregnant\"\"", "He does not want the man's support or help. He is using them for sperm and only, from what OP says, seems to have romantic interest in women and is only interest in men for hooking up.\n\nSimply living with a relative and working min wage is not enough to label someone as an unstable place or not having their shit together.", "No where does it state that it's purely for sperm or that there is no expectation of support for the kid. \n\nI would say that it's unstable. What happens if something happens to aunt or if aunt doesn't want a baby in the house. Can the friend get other housing, does he have a plan for childcare. Unless you have a secure place to stay and the ability to find another place if something out of your control happens then you do not have a stable situation."]}
