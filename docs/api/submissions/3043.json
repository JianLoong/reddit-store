It also needs to be reported to your state's consumer affairs department, BBB, whoever and everybody you can report it too. Dealership knows they needed a clear title in hand before taking it as a trade in. If the one party recording thing is legal in your state, I would do that too. What happens between the dealership and your mil is between them. MIL needs a reckoning for her actions. You know the saying \"____ around and find out?\" It's time mil learned it.", "NTA and oh HELL no. She has a lot of nerve!", "This is totally something my mother would do.", "NTA\n\nHoly hell do not take the 5K and get authorities involved if you have to. What does her child you are married to think about their mother's actions here? Are they doing ANYTHING to correct the issue your mother has created? Or are they just leaving you our to dry and deal with her after your so kindly loaned her your car and she sold it. Yeah your partner really needs to step up and deal with this mother issue.", "NtA", "NTA and you should take the police with the title and to get your car. Their issue with your MIL is her own.", "NTA She committed theft pure and simple and the dealership should have been a lot more careful and shouldn't be blustering their way out of it now.", "To be honest?  My knee-jerk reaction is to tell the dealer that they have been defrauded by your MIL, and they need to get the authorities involved.  (Also not sure what kind of dealer goes with \"Oh, I can get the title\" on a trade-in.  Last time I traded a car in, the dealer checked on ownership, or at least lien-holder.  Calls to the DMV are cheap.)   \n\n\nMy next knee-jerk reaction would be to call the police and advise them that your MIL stole the car, defrauded a local dealer, and you want either the car or the money.  \n\n\nJust out of curiosity, what does your partner say about all this?", "This is fraud, plain and simple. From both the dealership who didn't do their due diligence and from your MIL who tried to trade in a car that wasn't even hers. I mean the nerve of her is beyond entitled. She is quite the little con artist, isn't she.\n\nI think that you are way too lenient with this. You need to get the car back and let her deal with the consequences. What she did is illegal and I am shocked that the dealership let it go that far seeing that it wasn't her car to begin with. Guess they trusted what she said and just checked that it was paid for (no liens on it) but somehow checked the ownership later when they went to do the transfer.\n\nYou need to get a bigger backbone when it comes to this kind of thing. You seem kind and generous and most people would appreciate being loaned a car that long. You did her a huge favour and she had plenty of time to save up for a new car.\n\nThis reminds me of when my husband  loaned one of our cars to his sister who is also quite entitled. The deal was for her to pay the insurace for it every month and it was only supposed to be for a few months until they saved up for another car. Turns out his sister only paid for one month of insurance and still owes us money for that. When she stopped paying after several months, I told my husband to go get the car because frankly, I felt that she was taking advantage of us and it had been several months. \n\nThe car also came back damaged as well and one of her kids had taken a key and scratched something offensive inside the car on top of that. Of course, we were never reimbursed for the damage. I know too well what it is like to have an entitled inlaw. I have many instances of this particular inlaw being very entitled and thinking she has a right to something.\n\nThis incident is far worse because your MIL basically stole your car. I don't understand how you can think that you are the TA here at all.", "Nta. Go get your car.", "Wow- MIL and the car dealership have a problem.  Please don\u2019t back down!", "NTA. Call the cops on the dealership and go get the car.", "No! Don\u2019t let her have it. That\u2019s insane. Nta", "Nta and the dealer that took a car in trade without a title should be reported. And your mother should be reported for selling stolen merchandise", "why is it unreasonable to expect mil to give something back that she acquired illegally? NTA but stand up for yourself and your property man.", "OP=NTA\n\nPretty sure selling/trading a car without the legal right to the title is a crime.  (googled-says most states illegal without proof of ownership/title).\n\nGet your car back, and go no contact/low contact with you.", "NTA. How much was this new car? \n\nYou need to get your car back from her. If she was able to get a loan with the equity in YOUR CAR, she should be able to get a loan for $2k to get herself a beater. If you let her get away with this, you are essentially telling her you're okay with what she did.", "NTA and in the future, you should say that you need to sell your car to get a new one instead of giving in to her demands. That never leads to something good.", "NTA.  What was she thinking? She was selling something that didn't belong to her and lied about having approval to sell it!  Do not give her the car, and go LC.  It sounds like she's only interested in your money,", "NTA isn't that theft or fraud or some illegal act? MIL is awful and you should cut contact.", "YTA if you don't do the right thing by your partner and yourself and GET YOUR DAMN CAR BACK. It's not about who she is in your life, it's about the fact that she will continue to do this to you and others if she faces no repercussions! What happens if you have children and she keeps doing this exact same bullshit to them because \"she's their grandma and they don't deserve a better life than her\"? Do you just sit by and let it happen? Put your foot down and stand up for yourself! Good God!", "NTA. The dealership is shady and knew exactly what they were doing because they saw your name as soon as they looked up information on the car. Legally they should have contacted you first before making the sale. I wouldn't warn them, I'd just call the cops and report your car stolen and let them know the dealership bought your car knowing MiL wasn't the owner. Let MiL and the dealership sort it out.", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nLOL at this ~~stealership~~ dealership that is about to get smacked really hard when you put in that report for a stolen vehicle to the police.", "Police and lawyer.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep your title, go and pick up your car. Let MIL hande the rest. Not YOUR drama.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr if you don't want the stress, just REFUSE to hand over the title, and wait. Tell the shop you will  come pick up your car one of these days.", "NTA go pick up your car and sell it elsewhere. What your MIL does is up to her. The real issue is your spouse! Why is your spouse not mad? What does your spouse think? Why is your spouse not standing up to their mom?!?!?!?", "NTA and call the police. Sue her if possible in your state", "NTA\n\nBut now you know your MIL is a thief. I hope your spouse understands this and supports you.", "You dont need to be on aita for this, you need a lawyer and call law enforcement", "NTA. This JNMIL prime material.", "NTA . She traded YOUR car, she didn't even pay for it.", "NTA. The car is yours. The dealership has it. Just report it stolen to the police and get it back. If they took it as a trade in knowing the person who they were speaking with was not the owner, that is on them.", "NTA\n\nYour car was stolen and traded in without your permission. \n\nLet MIL know that your will be calling the police. Let her know that will be a felony charge of grand theft auto (well, depends on the value of your vehicle). Call the police when you say you will. Tell your partner that your good will to their parent has been extended too far.  \n\nCall the car sales and explain that you will be reporting the car stolen, since your MIL had merely borrowed the vehicle for a limited time and had no right to sell it (or use it as a trade in).", "NTA. The dealer fucked up here. You could report the car stolen, and they would be in big trouble.", "NTA.  Your MIL tried to steal $12K from you.  Please stand firm and refuse to give the title to the dealership.  Let them deal with MIL.  When she complains, you can remind her that you never gave her the car, you loaned it.", "Get your car back. Involve the police if needed. The dealer will have to repossess MIL's car. You can invite her over for dinner and let them know exactly where the car will be and when.", "That dealership is shady as hell for allowing this. Call the police and report it stolen.", "NTA.  Why do people on here find it so hard to say NO to a narcissist?  I grew up with one and after I got married I had no problem refusing to let her run my life.  And to let her have it for a year.  You should have known to set a time limit.  And never tell her anything remotely to do with money.", "I don\u2019t know how to edit, but in my state I believe the dealership could be fined. I think it\u2019s illegal to trade a car without the title.  I did it once but other than getting the title from the bank, the dealership had everything they needed to confirm ownership.  Geez", "NTA\n\nCall the police and get the car returned to you.", "NTA. Dude, there is so much wrong here that is 100% not your fault: \n\n1) your MIL committed several felonies. The two that IMMEDIATELY come to my mind (as a criminal justice graduate): grand larceny and auto theft, both of which carry hefty prison sentences. \n  1a. She also committed fraud, another felony with a hefty sentence, and lied to the dealership just to get this transaction done\n  1b. She deliberately withheld information from you in order to trade in your car to get a new one for herself without your consent \n2) these dealers are shady as hell\n   2a. They took a trade in without confirming the title\n   2b. They tried to strong arm you with essentially an ultimatum in order to get the title in order for the transaction to appear legitimate. \n\nYou need to either strong arm them back to get your car back or you need to go to the police and report this. You never consented to what you're MIL did, and you never consented to the dealership accepting your car as a trade in for your MIL. Don't under any circumstances back down, let your MIL get away with this, or let her borrow anything ever again. She has shown the lengths she will go to get what she wants.", "NTA and this sounds like a situation where going no contact would be completely justified.", "Agreed NTA except one little issue\n\n>maintenance is needed on the car.\n\nOP, It was still your car and it can be said that if you're allowing it to be on the road that *you* were ultimately responsible for making sure it's maintained. If you didn't want to pay for it because you thought she should due to her use, then you should have taken the car back until she paid for the PM.", "I traded a truck in once that was titled in my exs parents name. The dealer let me do it but there were numerous contingencies on it and my exs parents had to know to send the title but all and all\nIt was a bit loose\u2026this was during cash for clunkers and they needed used inventory they could sell. I\u2019m sure right now they\u2019d put up more roadblocks.", "They obviously wanted to make that sell and went ahead hoping OP would agree later. It's on them and the MIL with he finer details. NTA", "100% this, I'd already have a lawyer on them too.", "Actually, the giver pays 'gift' tax, not the recipient.  Plus you can give up to about 15k with no gift tax (more if you use some of your lifetime exemption, but this reduces the amount of your estate that goes tax free when you die.)  In many states, if you give a family member a car, then you don't have to pay some of the normally required taxes a non-family transfer would entail.", "There is no gift tax due unless one is giving away millions of dollars.  Besides, it is the giver who pays the gift tax.", ">If she could buy a newer car, by using yours as a trade in, she could have gotten a car that works properly, but isn't as nice, without trading in yours.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s exactly what OP did.", "No, the MIL will never pay him for the car.  Best to let the police handle it.  If he gets his car back MIL will probably have to give her new car back, too.  Whoever financed the car made the loan on the basis of the trade in and won't give her more money as she would be upside down on the car.", "I would recommend OP getting a time the cops will go there so OP can take possession of the car so it's not towed with more fees. Although, even with fees, it's worth it. \n\nDon't let her use this car again OP. Trade it in and get YOUR money for it. \n\nAlso, r/JUSTNOMIL can be helpful for dealing with narcissistic MILs.", "I wouldn't let the police touch your car if possible. Unless they call you and have you come pick it up, it will get towed to an impound lot and start accruing fees. Years ago, my YJ was stolen, found partially stripped and towed to an impound lot while insurance dealt with it. Nobody could bother to put a tarp over it to stop a month of rainfall getting into it. \n\nRealistically, the dealership should return OP's car and take it upon themselves to repossess the car MIL 'purchased' if she can't work out new terms. If they refuse, pay a lawyer a couple hundred bucks and have them send a letter to the dealership.", "This will cause mom to end up in prison.", "The OP needs to get a backbone here and demand her car back otherwise it will be reported as stolen.", "Time to go get your car. \n\nCall the cops and report it stolen. You gave her permission to drive it NOT to sell it. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to steal upwards of 10K from you. Don\u2019t roll over.", "Dude, I do not get how you are not going for your car. It's your car and the dealership has no claim over it. Like others have said, they knew it didn't belong to your mil. This is a huge disrespect and will get worse if you let her get away with it.", "Yes, if MIL legitimately believed OP had gifted her the car, she only had to go to OP and say, I need the title transferred so I can use it as a trade-in.  She did it this way because she knew she didn't own car.", "Yes, but if he truly led her to believe that it was intended to be a gift (clearly not the case here based on his comments), leading her to believe that he would sign the title over whenever she sold it, that would be somewhat AH behavior.", "I'm not talking about federal gift tax, I'm talking about state.\n\nIt varies from state to state but often the tax is on the recipient.    Also, sales tax (technically not gift tax but essentially that's what it is) is required in many states.\n\nA long time ago, we ran into that in my state--if you gave a car to a family member, they had to pay sales tax on the full value, but if you sold it to them for a nominal cost, they only had to pay sales tax on that nominal cost.    Technically not a gift tax but we essentially considered it one since you paid more for a free vehicle than a purchased one.    Not sure if my state laws are the same now though.", "Go get your car", "Then by all means go get your car back and let the dealership and/or the police deal with MIL.
