Take your title with you (don't tell the dealership you have it with you) and get your car. If they refuse to hand it over, call the police. In some states what the dealership has done is a crime. It also needs to be reported to your state's consumer affairs department, BBB, whoever and everybody you can report it too. Dealership knows they needed a clear title in hand before taking it as a trade in. If the one party recording thing is legal in your state, I would do that too.

Their issue with your MIL is her own.", "NTA She committed theft pure and simple and the dealership should have been a lot more careful and shouldn't be blustering their way out of it now.", "To be honest?  My knee-jerk reaction is to tell the dealer that they have been defrauded by your MIL, and they need to get the authorities involved.  (Also not sure what kind of dealer goes with \"Oh, I can get the title\" on a trade-in.  Last time I traded a car in, the dealer checked on ownership, or at least lien-holder.  Calls to the DMV are cheap.)   \n\n\nMy next knee-jerk reaction would be to call the police and advise them that your MIL stole the car, defrauded a local dealer, and you want either the car or the money.  \n\n\nJust out of curiosity, what does your partner say about all this?", "This is fraud, plain and simple. From both the dealership who didn't do their due diligence and from your MIL who tried to trade in a car that wasn't even hers. I mean the nerve of her is beyond entitled. She is quite the little con artist, isn't she.\n\nI think that you are way too lenient with this. You need to get the car back and let her deal with the consequences. What she did is illegal and I am shocked that the dealership let it go that far seeing that it wasn't her car to begin with. Guess they trusted what she said and just checked that it was paid for (no liens on it) but somehow checked the ownership later when they went to do the transfer.\n\nYou need to get a bigger backbone when it comes to this kind of thing. You seem kind and generous and most people would appreciate being loaned a car that long. You did her a huge favour and she had plenty of time to save up for a new car.\n\nThis reminds me of when my husband  loaned one of our cars to his sister who is also quite entitled. The deal was for her to pay the insurace for it every month and it was only supposed to be for a few months until they saved up for another car. Turns out his sister only paid for one month of insurance and still owes us money for that. When she stopped paying after several months, I told my husband to go get the car because frankly, I felt that she was taking advantage of us and it had been several months. \n\nThe car also came back damaged as well and one of her kids had taken a key and scratched something offensive inside the car on top of that. Of course, we were never reimbursed for the damage. I know too well what it is like to have an entitled inlaw. I have many instances of this particular inlaw being very entitled and thinking she has a right to something.\n\nThis incident is far worse because your MIL basically stole your car.
