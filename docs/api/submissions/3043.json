If they don\u2019t agree to immediately retuning the car, file a police report.", "NTA\n\nI would tell the dealership that this is an issue they need to take up with MIL and that they better hurry because come Monday morning, you will be reporting the car as stolen\n\nSomeone at the dealership royally fucked up because you can't take a trade without a title\n\nLet them sort it out and do not hesitate to call the police because dealerships are usually filled with people who don't give a shit about anyone or anything", "NTA  . She must be stopped!\nShe obviously had funds a-plenty to treat herself to a new car.", "My brother pulled this shit when my mother had a stroke and went into care. Her car was half paid off so I said if he continued making the payments I would sign it over to him when it was paid off. Since she\u2019d qualified for a Medicaid bed we couldn\u2019t sell it as it would put too much money in her name. \n\nSo what does he do? Trades it in for a new mustang the instant he got back home. Dealer called me to get the title and I explained it wasn\u2019t his to sell. They ended up sending me a check for the trade in value and going after my brother for it. He was pissed but it was his own fault. \n\n(I tucked the check away into an account that I kept for paying for luxuries and whatnot for her; thankfully the state never followed up on what happened to the car. Her house was under water so no money there to worry about.)", "NTA- you should pick up the car then trade in/sell the car to another place yourself as your mil obviously doesn\u2019t need to borrow your car. Mil should not drive that car again, she just proved you were right about her", "Your MIL is a thief and you should call the police on both her and the dealer. NTA except to yourself that you are letting her not get what she deserves.", "NTA \n\nBut you need to act *now*. \n\nMake sure that YOU are the only person with access to the vehicle ownership documents. Your partner may well be trustworthy but it's *their* mother and I guarantee that a narcissist like her knows how to manipulate her kids. \n\nWhat you need to do now is **call the police** and report the car as stolen. Explain that your MIL traded in your vehicle that you allowed her to *borrow* and that the dealership that accepted the trade *without the relevant documentation* are now harrassing you for the proof of ownership **so that they can sell the car on.** \n\nI'd suggest that you document your communication with the dealership (because they screwed up massively by allowing the trade-in without proof of ownership) and gather the receipts for all the work that you paid for on the car, because that shows responsibility for the vehicle and maintenance.", "Look either you get your money or MIL keeps her car. Those are the only two options.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you've been brainwashed & pistol whipped into senselessness being around MIL. I've seen it happen to others, through spouses, significant others, parents even myself. It's mental & emotional abuse coming from dealing with intense & repetitive hampering at sensibility.\n\nHow? Directly/indirect behavior some very subliminal while other actions combine are belittling, demeaning, second-guessing actions, gaslighting & making one wonder if making appropriate decisions. It's based on entitlement, narcissistic, self-centered & temper tantrum behavior.\n\nChildren show the damaging consequences. Example husband who never sees how destructive mother is towards the wife or his children. \n\nOP's been dealing with this MIL's drama & nonsense for years has become numb to her antics. OP can't see how destructive & sabotaging affecting OP. Can say no but when it gets extremely serious, not only does husband go no contact. OP can't show anger & be upset MIL having a car for over a year? Why? Does OP have her own family issues?\n\nThis isn't the first time MIL has done outrageous behavior, yet OP acts so calm & flat. That's what is troubling she's not really emoting.\n\n>*A comment OP made: They are even more upset than me because of the pattern of behavior over the years. MIL has always been a thief and justifies it but saying the people she takes from have more.*\n\nMIL isn't perfect OP knows that, but what don't get how not accept the reality. Somehow in a fog as never would a stranger be able to do this. This is a crime same as if shot someone (obviously not bodily injury merely showing intent will do something). MIL intentionally lied to OP, blatantly, deliberately *without* remorse. That's the serious problem here. Trust was broken & disrespects OP. Didn't do this to son, why DIL? A lot of hate, anger, jealousy & envy towards OP. Husband & siblings have gone no contact, despite that, OP worries about her not having a car. ***WHY? What's so important MIL needs OP's car more?***\n\nThere are several problems with how this is written \n\n* OP wants to buy a specific model cost is more out-of-reach but can be made affordable. \n\n>*I had my eye on an infinity, but it was a little out of my price range. However, with a trade-in and bonus, i could afford it.* \n\nReading comprehension: \n\n* Believe that OP could purchase the car both with trade-in value of current car with bonus recently acquired. Did it go through? Or did OP have to wait until car was returned. \n\nTiming issue\n\n>*Fast forward to a year later, maintenance is needed on the car. She always claims poverty when she wants something and somehow expected my partner and I to foot the bill. When we said no, she wanted us to cosign a loan for the maintenance, and once again, the answer was no. Fast forward a few weeks, and we don't hear from her. The next thing we know, she pulls up in a new car.*\n\n* A year later? \n   * I thought OP was purchasing the vehicle immediately, now it's a year later? That doesn't add up. Yeah, one can budget & plan to make a purchase. \n      * However, OP gave impression it would've have '*immediately*' been purchased within days. \n      * Excuse me, one doesn't plan for a *trade-in value* a year later. It needs to be done sooner than later, as depreciation from condition, mileage & age lowers its value as well as the cost of the new car could increase.\n   * MIL had the car for over a year? Huh? What was OP driving?\n      * Out of spite did MIL keep OP from purchasing another car, or OP bought the car without the trade-in? Confusing.\n\nMoney Issue\n\n>*She always claims poverty when she wants something and somehow expected my partner and I to foot the bill. When we said no, she wanted us to cosign a loan for the maintenance, and once again, the answer was no.* \n\nMIL *appears* to be financially stretched can't purchase a car w/o son or DIL cosigning a loan and/or giving some form of down payment. Yet shows up with a new car. Something is missing, trading-in a car doesn't just get one another car in this situation. If her own car is in bad shape not great additional trade-in value.\n\nWe don't know if it's a lease or purchase. How managed to pay for insurance on a *new car* good luck as her older car most likely had less insurance. Besides all the other fees have to be paid too (taxes, down payment & plates etc.) to drive off lot. \n\n*", "NTA, let her know that you give her 24 hrs to get the car or it's actual value (the 12K) back to you or you will report it as stolen to the police.

Legally, the new car is not your MIL\u2019s because the car she traded in was not hers to do so.  How could MIL afford a new car Liam if she could not even get a maintenance loan without a co-signor?    Honestly, at this point, you need to talk with your partner.  The only options here are to let your MIL get away with her actions, have her take the car back and get your car, or tell her you are reporting it stolen.
