I\u2019m not letting anyone but my spouse use my vehicle unless it\u2019s an actual emergency and even then, I\u2019ll probably loan them the money for an Uber.

Yeah, I didn't think so. You're right on the \"disrespect\" part -- and wanting to conserve your resources is not \"pretentious\" at all, it's protective.\n\n*Don't ever give her your keys again.* Tell her that your insurance provider will jack your premiums or yank your coverage if you let other folks drive it... particularly if they have a bad driving record. (Shoot, check with the person who sold you your insurance, this may well be true.) It's not about you being \"stingy\", it's about INSURANCE COVERAGE.\n\nAnd when you go away, don't leave the car parked where she sees it every day. Find a friend's place with a secure spot in a carport or somewhere safe. It's pretty obvious that your mom will trample every boundary you set about that car.

When I was in high school, my boyfriend worked his butt off at a plant nursery carting heavy trees around for hours after school. He saved up to buy a cool Mustang convertible. While he was in school, she\u2019d drive it around all day. He\u2019d get ready to take me out on a date, and guess what? Empty tank every time. I\u2019d hide those keys and keep them secure! She could sneak and drive it when you\u2019re not around. To add insult to injury, boyfriend\u2019s mom gave him an 11:00pm curfew. She\u2019d lock him out of the house at that time, and his brother would have to help him climb in the window!

This is *your* car, that *you* paid for with *your* hard-earned money! \n\nI definitely second the idea of having the car parked elsewhere when you're on holiday - as someone with borderline personality disorder myself, having the temptation/\"insult\" in sight would be messy mentally. The mental illness is definitely no excuse for acting like an ass, and whilst I can empathise with your mother's condition, I don't condone her behaviour in the slightest. Even those of us who struggle with the disorder need to respect others' boundaries, and it *is* possible to do, BPD or not.\n\nCongratulations on your hard work paying off, you should be proud of yourself!", "NTA. It's your car at the end of the day. Make sure you take your keys with you. Even better, park the car at a friends before you leave so it's not sat there reminding her that you said she can't use it.

May quit talking to me for a period of time or try to say I can't even take my vacation, and I do live with her.", "But that would absolutely mean that her mother would then need to be excluded from her own policy or likewise her mother would have to be on it. Anyone of driving age in the household has to either be on a policy or excluded. This is standard policy language. With the vehicle being so new, depending on policy language, if her mother was not listed on the policy then she could potentially face not being afforded coverage. This why it would not make sense to have her own policy unless she was excluding everyone else in the home off the policy. So you\u2019re not wrong but there\u2019s certainly a lot more to it.", "Because the mother seems to be overbearing, crossing boundaries kind of parent who doesnt respect her child's wishes.\n\nIt is a waste of time and energy delving further into the topic.", "Welp, sounds like it's time to start saving for your own place OP. You (and your Charger!) can't live as a hostage in your own home.\n\nPlease do check up on the insurance angle. Who is named as a driver on the policy? What happens if you add your mother as an insured driver (nothing good, I expect)?\n\n<Edited to add:> Your nuclear option if you must stay in that household would be: *sell your car,* before your mother wrecks it. Seriously. Then you'll have the money safely in the bank, out of her reach, and you'll know that you can buy your own car when you move out.\n\nThe worst outcome is: she wrecks your car, she can't pay to fix it, your insurance voids coverage because you \"let her\" drive it, she is at fault and hurt someone in the accident, and the car is GONE with nothing to show for it. Even worse if you're still paying off loans for the car or its insurance policy. I hope this does not happen to you!!", "NTA, but it's time to grow up. You're an adult, so any authority your mother has over you is authority that you allow her to have over you.", "You're a legal adult.  She can't prevent you from taking a vacation.  And, well, if she quits talking to you, that means she can't ask for your car keys.  \n\nSpeaking of keys, make sure you keep the main key on you at all times, and hide the spare somewhere with Ft. Knox level safety.", "OP would need to advise her carrier of other household members who are also licensed drivers.  You are correct she should exclude her mom or anyone else in the home she specifically doesn't want driving her vehicle.", "I know I\u2019m correct.", "Not entirely, but I'm glad you think you are."]}
