I also realized I don't want to date men.\n\nI met Michael (21M). We have classes/clubs together. We hung out a lot. I never thought of it as 'romantic' dates because I went to the same places/did same activities with other friends of different genders. I also mentioned once that I am not trying to date (above reasons).\n\nMichael is really smart. I would ask for help on homework assignments last semester, and he would always oblige. I would try to make up for it by paying for his meals but he turned me down most of the time.\n\nHe also got me a ton of gifts for my birthday. I was really surprised by this because I all I did was pay for his takeout meal on his birthday before mine. I thought maybe he had feelings for me but I didn't ask.\n\nLater he confessed to me and I turned him down. I asked if we could still be friends and he agreed.\n\nThis semester we have the same schedule. I asked if we could do the homework together and he didn't answer. I thought I was being too pushy so I backed off and didn't ask for help on the next one. I went to office hours and he was there. He saw me and walked away fast. I texted him + asked if he was ok, and he didn't answer.\n\nHe continued to ignore me at club meetings and lectures. If I was near him, he walked away from me. It sucked. After two weeks of this, I just started ignoring him and didn't go to classes as much.\n\nLike two days after I started doing this, Michael texted me that how he can't get over me, and that I'm the most beautiful girl in the world he likes me so much and he's so sorry etc. I told him that I felt unwanted and anxious to go to school. I said I would take a break from talking to him. I stopped asking him for help, but he kept sending me his answers anyway.\n\nI saw Michael later at a club party. We talked after, and he complained to me about how bad he felt when I ignored him for one day and a half, and I just couldn't sympathize with him after he ignored me for 2 weeks. He tried to use the homework answers against me, saying he knows I need them. I said that I never asked for them and he sighed.\n\nI told him he could've just told me he's still uncomfortable around me and I would understand, and he just sighed again and said 'what's wrong with me'. It got late and he went home, but I still didn't text him as much as I used to before.\n\nWe had another social. After, he texted me drunk saying 'he knows I don't care about him'. Later, he asked to get lunch. He bailed and said again that 'i don't care about him'. I figured he was trying to get me to pander to his self loathing here so I gave answers like 'Ok'. He got pissed off saying that it sounds like 'I really don't care about him' and I told him to leave me alone until he figures out it's not my problem I don't have feelings for him. He hasn't talked to me since and I feel better but still uneasy.\n\nDid I take advantage of him, and that's why our friendship went downhill?", "created_utc": 1680814337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dxlib/aita_for_turning_down_my_friend_aggressively_and/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made it clear you didn't want a romantic relationship. He kept pressing. You declined and he is having trouble processing that info. Maybe he did those things for you because he thought he had a chance with you, but you were clear from the start.", "NTA screw that guy. You did nothing wrong.

Sadly, some men are not capable of truly being friends with a woman. Some are, but they're few and far between. Men can sometimes feel very entitled and transactional when they have feelings for you. Providing you with things like gifts and homework help were ways to get you to owe him feelings in return. By not going along with things the way he wanted, you've made him feel, in his mind, the injured party. Continue ignoring him and focus on your classes. He is not a viable candidate for any kind of friendship.", "NTA, he\u2019s trying to gaslight, manipulate & emotionally blackmail you. I\u2019d sever all ties, block him as much as you can & go on w/your life, BUT be cautious, it sounds like you could have a potential stalker situation on your hands", "NTA. The boy needs to learn to deal with his emotions. Him dumping his unrequited affections onto you is really shitty of him.

I would block and avoid him from now on.", "NTA so many times this had happened to me with male \"friends\" they're always thinking they are the victim, they always find a way to make a pass at you after a break up or a vulnerable moment... He's \"nice guy\" the \"friend zone\" guy , who will manipulate you into thinking you're the bad person, you're not, HE IS", "Unfortunately this looks like classic nice guy/ friend zone nonsense. \n  \n  He was never your friend, he was only acting like it to make you fall in love with/ want to sleep with him. Now you know three things: he\u2019s good at lying and manipulating; he thinks he deserves love/ sex in exchange for basic kindness; and he doesn\u2019t care what you actually want, he only wants to make you want what he wants. \n  \n  Now he\u2019s trying to guilt trip you and is lashing out?
