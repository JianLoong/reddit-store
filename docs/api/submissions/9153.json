did they have entirely different dress codes posted and keep out men who weren't wearing suits? no, of course not. but the environment changed and the social expectations changed and everyone involved understood that  \n\nthere's a big difference between being dressed up enough to be allowed in the doors and being dressed up enough to fit in\n\nthat's pretty much always the case, with the exception of extremely strict dress codes for particular events\n\nwhen it comes to dress standards most rules are soft and not explicit. that's why people actively ask questions like can I wear a sports coat and slacks or do I need to wear a suit? is this suit fancy enough or do I need to wear a different suit? do I need to wear a tie? do I need to wear a bowtie? women ask similar questions about their attire all the time  \n\nwhen you've only dressed up enough to get in the door but not enough to actually meet the dress standard, you do stick out like a super thumb. especially if there's a significant gap between the standard and the hard rules. people notice the one person in the room in more casual clothes. it can be awkward and uncomfortable. it's not fun to feel shlubby or underdressed when you're trying to have a fancy night out. particularly if you are going out with someone it can be uncomfortable if one of you is dressed up and the other isn't     \n\nthere are similar standards with women's clothes it's just less formalized. but there are absolutely dresses and sets that women could wear that would totally pass the threshold for the rules but they would still seem wildly underdressed. especially if the woman was with someone who was dressed up appropriately   \n\nnow sure, they're both uncomfortable with what the other person has requested but the requests are completely not equivalent   \n\nshe wants to dress up and go to a fancy dinner. that means she wants her partner dressed in a manner that fits the dress standard of the environment and that matches her own level of getting dressed up. she already agreed to the getting dressed up to the right level of fancyiness when she proposed this dinner   \n\nbut instead of flat out saying \"no, I'm not comfortable getting dressed up\", he's trying to bargain saying that he'll only dress equally fancy if she also wears a specific style of revealing dress that he desires and she isn't comfortable with   \n\nthey really are not the same thing fundamentally at all  \n\nand their discomforts aren't equivalent either. he hates suits, but he hasn't described feeling any kind of body image issues associated with him wearing suits. meanwhile he's specifically asking her to do wear clothes that he knows trigger body issue images for her  \n\nthere is a difference between feeling stuffy and feeling ugly or exposed or humiliated. not all discomforts are equal   \n\nand he can say that his intent wasn't to humiliate his wife and that he thinks she would still be sexy in those kinds of clothes and that he wants her to feel confident. but his actions here show the exact opposite of that\n\nafter gaining weight and becoming more uncomfortable with her body, his wife is specifically requesting a fancy night out where they both dress up. that means she needs to buy a new dress regardless. the fact that she feels up to dress shopping is already a great sign. dress shopping is often stressful and anxiety producing and often triggers body image issues in women. especially if they are fatter than they were before. in fact even if she's just as comfortable in her current body, dress shopping is still ten times harder and more stressful because the fatter you are the fewer options you have and the less likely your options are to fit appropriately. that's another thing he's not considering - it may be considerably difficult for her to even find the same style of dress, and it's very unlikely to fit her in the way it's intended. it's also potentially much more physically uncomfortable to wear at a different size\n\nasking for this dinner IS her trying to feel more comfortable and confident and sexy in her body. she wants to get dressed up in a way that she hasn't since gaining weight. she wants to get a dress that she feels beautiful and confident in. so if he did actually want to encourage his wife to feel good about her body and feel sexy and confident, then he wouldn't have pulled this stunt. she was literally trying to do that and he dumped a bucket of cold water all over her attempt by insisting that he'd only go along with it if she wore a specific style of dress she isn't comfortable wearing. that's also a great way to send a signal to her that he doesn't her sexy or beautiful in other dresses, or that he doesn't like her current body and preferred her when she was thinner   \n\nthe requests they are making of each other are totally not equivalent\n\nthe discomforts they are expressing are totally not equivalent\n\nand he is specifically being an asshole about her body in a way that she is most definitely not", "Again, *formal wear was required*.
