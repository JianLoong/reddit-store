A suit is a very baseline requirement for men's formal wear. It doesn't seem to me that he's asking her to buy a formal dress bc she doesn't have any, he's asking for a particular style based entirely on his preferences, not level of formality required for the venue. It becomes grosser if it's about a sexual preference vs. just a stylistic preference.\n\nThe male equivalent would be if she asked him to get a bold colored tailored suit in that modern skinny highwater pants style that is really restrictive and is not forgiving on larger waistlines. She is obviously not doing that, otherwise OP would have definitely mentioned it.", "The dress type being \u201cmore than she\u2019s comfortable wearing\u201d also makes me think it could be revealing, but it could also mean it\u2019s gaudy or over-the-top.

Apparently the one I have isn\u2019t good enough.", "She only has to do this because she lacks formal wear that fits.

Even if she doesn't own formal wear, I don't think it's fair for him to weaponize his wife's body issues to get his way (ie not getting dressed up).", "There are so many different styles of dresses that she could look beautiful in. He cherry picked the style she's insecure about. Formal wear for women isn't as standardized as for men so it's not like she couldn't just wear another style of formal dress.", "Is that what he wants though? Would she be uncomfortable in a dress that makes her look beautiful? Doubt it.", "OP says the type of dress she used to wear before she put on weight. His words \"She got bigger\"\n\nYTA OP. Your wife asked you to wear a suit and make an effort therefore its perfectly reasonable for you to ask her to wear a dress and make an effort also. If that's what you asked it would be NTA.

Still, if she wants him in formal she should reciprocate.", "why are you on reddit? why don't you go work out?", "She got bigger so she isn't comfortable with the style he requested, as far as we know the person requesting the formal dinner has formal wear, just not the specific style of dress OP is requesting."]}
