Did she give a reason why your existing suit is not enough?", "Not many women I know feel uncomfortable in clothes that make them look beautiful but ok bro.", "She has stated she is uncomfortable wearing that kind of dress due to her body issues. Is an uncomfortable partner attractive to you?", "He is asking for a specific TYPE of dress. Most likely a body con or something revealing, that she is not comfortable wearing. This is NOT the same favor as \"wear any suit\".", "he is super hot and cool. and way better than his loser wife.", "To reiterate the above poster, throwing together a random sport coat and some slacks does not a suit make. Not even throwing together a suit coat and a different pair of trousers. Whether you agree or not, a suit is a whole cohesive outfit. Saying \"wear a suit\" is not the same as slacks and a jacket.", "I did not pick that up. If he just wants her to be formal if he is formal: fair. If he is dictating how formal works, he is not. Neither would she be if she asked for formal, then demands a particular outfit."]}
