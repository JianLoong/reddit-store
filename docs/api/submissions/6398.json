Your lawyers say she could challenge the eviction and believe you me there will be lawyers out there very happy to take her case on contingency (or even pro bono).   I'd negotiate with her to encourage her to leave with a smile on her face - say $10,000 to help cover her relocation expenses or something like that.

And as you are - rightly - unwilling to take on that extra cost and burden, then there's nothing left to do here but sell the house. \n\nOne thing I might suggest is to offer her and/or her kids the first chance to buy the house. If her kids are so concerned about their mother, THEY can buy the house from you at a fair price and take on the cost and hassle of maintaining the house.

Is someone talking to you?  Bc I dont hear anyone speaking to you.\n\nThis was a woman your father cohabitated with.  No relationship to you.  You owe her nothing.

He certainly created an uncomfortable situation for both of you.\n\nIn any case, you are NTA. You have no interest in maintaining the house, and Penny would be financially unable to maintain it even if you gifted it to her. So selling it is clearly the best approach.\n\nThat said, you aren't obligated to follow your father's wishes. You could be more generous toward Penny than he was, if you choose to be. I don't think vicious messages from her children would inspire me to feel generous, but perhaps you are kinder than I am.", "NTA. \n\nNo idea why your father did what he did, but since he did it a year before he passed and was with her for 7 years, it feels intentional. \n\nBut that doesn't really matter either. It is your money and up to you to decide what to do with all of it. That means you get to decide how you want to spend it and how/if you want to help. \n\nI think there are two things you could do if you feel guilty or just want to look forward in your life knowing you were the \"bigger person\" or just right with the universe.  So, if I was in your position, I might offer Penny and her family the house at the exact market value or a little under. Alternatively, I might give Penny some money so that she can find another place to live and move comfortably. Not like half the value of the house or anything, but based on the cost of living in that country/area, paying for her moving expenses, and like first, last, security on an apartment would be an amazing gesture.\n\nIt is all about what feels right to YOU, not about being an AH/not an AH at all, just to be clear. You are NTA in any way, I'm just offering an additional little bit of advice here.", "NTA - Your father left this to you and his intentions were clear. Penny\u2019s kids should be more focused on finding a place for their mother to live than with you.", "NTA she got kids they can take care of her.. if your father did that a year before he passed I believe there was more to it. Believe your dad because that right there was a statement on how he felt. She was probably already counting on that for her and her kids and said some shady stuff that alarm your father.. DO NOT feel bad.", "> I have notified her via the lawyers of the intention to sell the house, which has led to vicious and vitriolic messages from her kids calling me evil and heartless\n\nthere's a simple solution here, her kids can buy the house for her.\n\nIf her own children are not willing to support her, why would they expect you to?  \n\nNTA", "NTA - I'm sorry for your loss and I understand you want to bring closer. Your reasons and actions are sound. Just because her children reacted negatively does not make their perspective right. Its time for Penny and them to create a solution. This is not on you. Continue to do what is necessary to move this along through your lawyers. Best to you.", "NTA unless you are selling it immediately without any time allotted for her to find other accommodations.  Have you considered offering to sell it to her for slightly below market value as a gesture of goodwill?

Or even sell it to her at a reasonable price?\n\nFrom other comments, it seems your father may have simply been capricious. I can absolutely see where Penny, and her family, feel like you're screwing her over, but I'm extremely empathetic to not wanting to deal with the estate.\n\nWhen you have the money to ignore his, leave a trust fund for your daughter, etc. then it would literally cost you nothing, in real terms, to just *give* her the inheritance instead.", "I understand that your estranged father left you everything but also do you have a heart? Your dad sounds like a cold hearted person and it sounds like you didn\u2019t care for him much either. His widow is now left fending for herself and depended on him. You could at least give her a chunk of the money you make off the house so she can at least afford an apartment til she figures things out. You said so yourself that you don\u2019t care about your father or his money.", "Perhaps if there is enough you could help her purchase a more budget friendly home or apartment so she downsizes appropriately for her age, and something her kids could help her maintain. Or at least 6 months rent", "NTA. Can you buy Penny a much smaller property in her name that she can afford to maintain? Or offer to cover her rent for a year? If your dad had a heart, he probably would made arrangements to not leave her homeless after his passing.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to house her, but it would be a kindness.", "NTA\n\nThe house will sell for more unoccupied, no retail buyer will buy the house and then go through an eviction. Also someone moving out can do a considerable amount of costly damage that is hard to \u201cprove\u201d they did and the chance of recovering damages if you can may be very low.  \n\nI would suggest it is in your own personal financial interest to make a generous offer to move.  Pay for moving, deposit on a new place, first months rent, and maybe a small amount of cash from the trust.", "NAH. I can see why she is upset and why you want to wash your hands of the situation. Since you don\u2019t want the money and don\u2019t seem to particularly like your father, why not just give her the house and let her deal with the upkeep or sell it? While she doesn\u2019t have a legal right to it, it would be the kind thing to do since it seems like your father deliberately left her in a bad situation. You wouldn\u2019t be the AH if you didn\u2019t give it to her though.", "NTA. I could see how maybe without context it sounds bad, but you seemed to have gone through the proper channels to notify her and everything. You are not responsible for Penny or her life choices.", "NTA.\n\nMany wheels within wheels here.  But the bottom line is it's your property and you have no obligation to make it available to Penny, still less maintain it at your expense.  Cut ties. Sell.", "NTA.  Your father set this up, you are under no obligation to do other than what will provides.  You may need a lawyer to evict her", "NTA. Your dad did this on purpose, you're just left holding the bag.\n\nBTW I'm sure there are options between let her live in the house forever and kick her out on the street with nothing available, perhaps talk to the lawyers about them if you want to be a better person than your dad was...", "NTA", "SOOO NTA.\n\nYour father left everything to you, not her. If he wanted her to have it he would have left it to her. The fact that she cannot afford the house so YOU would be paying for her and it is not even in the same country as you... I would do the same. Penny's situation is not your problem. I would, for my own morality, tell her I was selling the house and advise that the entire estate was left to you so nothing is out of left field.\n\nShe will probably cry and scream about it but I would also find out the value of the house, give a little discount below that and offer her to buy it but she has until x date to get that all done at that price otherwise it goes on the market. \n\nits not fair to you to have to pay for someone else to live in YOUR house.", "NTA as she was in the will left with something so she couldn't contest. If it was he didnt update it for those 7 years just because he didn't get around to it then borderline yes but technically no. Its weird to call her his widow since he didnt want her to have any of his stuff after 7 years.", "NTA, your father made his decision and it's not on you to just give a valuable house to someone you have very little relationship with. Mostly, it's bad of your dad to leave his wife out of his will entirely if she was financially dependant on him. Maybe it was just an oversight on his part and he intended to give her something, but there's no way for you to know now. Even then, there's a good chance it wouldn't have been the entire house.\n\nMaybe offer to give her a portion of the inheritance/house price if you're feeling generous. Not that there should be any expectation on you to do so, but if as you say you don't really need the money and it's a very valuable house, then a generous gesture may help to reduce the tensions.\n\nInheritance issues like this always suck, my dad went through a similar thing with his sisters when my grandfather died. Best of luck with it, and sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nIt's not as if she can maintain the house and it's right down the street. It's in another country and she cannot afford to live there. If her kids are that concerned, they can take her in or buy her the house/a place to live. She is not your responsibility and there's a reason your dad did what he did.", "NTA. But you could do an act of kindness for your father's widow, someone whom he loved. Especially since you say you don't need the money - and have inherited the entire estate, including the house. \n\nSell the house.  You're probably right that you can't look after it from another country, and continue to be responsible for its upkeep. Put most of it into a trust for your daughter. But if Penny doesn't have a legal right, I think it's arguable that she has a moral right to a share in the house, given that it is her residence, and she has put her work into it. Use a portion of the estate either to buy Penny a modest place, or set her up with rent for a couple of years - depending on what is feasible. Or maybe you could consider allowing her to live there rent-free, and put some of the estate into management of the property, via an agent, since you can't manage it yourself.\n\nAre you certain, BTW, that she has no legal claim on the house? My sister died recently, and her will divided everything between her son and her long-term partner - but left the house they lived in 100% to her son. That was something my sister and partner both agreed upon, imagining they had 30 years ahead together.  Under New Zealand law (where she lived), her partner could claim half the house, regardless of the will; this did not involve any kind of legal contestation, as half the house was his by law. We worked it out as a family, that he could live rent-free in the house indefinitely, and also gave him a portion of the estate to manage it and retire debts against it; and in return he didn't claim half the house. Everyone walked away happy (or as happy as they could be in these awful circumstances).", "NTA\n\nIgnore the kids.   Block them, in fact.  Get her moved out and close that chapter in your life for your and your daughter's sake.", "NAH\n\nYour father's will is his will. It's what he wanted. Abiding by the deceased's wishes in this case does not make you an a-hole.\n\nYour father created this situation. He painted both you and his widow into opposing corners. And who knows what he was telling her while alive. This seems to have caught her off guard and I can understand her children's reaction. Maybe they're just gold-diggers or maybe they're livid that their mother would be so discarded by her husband in death.\n\nThere's a lot of unknowns here but I'm left wondering what happened a year ago that he made this move to almost completely exclude her from an inheritance.", "NTA. If your dad made the decision to leave everything to you, Penny and her kids have to respect that. Her kids are just mad that they now have to take in/support their mom, when they falsely believed your dad would take care of her financially and otherwise for the rest of her life.", "NTA. Your father made his choices and your respecting that. His widows problems are her own.", "Honestly seems like ESH to me. Imagine treating your wife this way, honestly so shitty of your father to do this", "Overall, if this happened to me and I didn't care about the money from my father, I'd seek a dialogue with the widow and seek to find a solution where she covers the costs. Perhaps her family can do that while you retain ownership. Equally, perhaps not, but what is there to lose by trying?\n\nIf you truly mean what you say, then her not keeping the property in top condition won't matter to you as it having a higher or lower value then doesn't matter as you expected nothing from your father anyway.\n\nSo...the question is how honest you really are when you write \"I don't want my father's money\" because it sure sounds like you didn't expect it, but now that you have it, you definitely want it.\n\nSo...YTA. Kicking old ladies out of their home is always going to be a AH move.", "This story makes little sense. Your rather distant father was married to this woman, but made a will that would leave her broke & homeless? I don't buy it. Where large estates are concerned, there are usually lawyers willing to work pro-bono for a cut of whatever they can claw back from the will.\n\nI guess your father would be the real AH here, but there is nothing preventing you from selling the house & using some of the proceeds to set up a trust in Penny's name, so you can live with a clean conscience.\n\nYTA for going along with your father's cruelty.", "Yeah, NTA.  It sucks but that's your father's fault, not yours.  You shouldn't be obligated to pay for the upkeep of a house you don't even want.  I agree with the other commenters - Penny's kids can take her in or help her find a new place.", "NTA. Tell her and her kids to speak to your lawyer going forward.", "NTA\n\nTell her kids that keep calling you that they are more then welcome to support their own mother. You are not responsible for her in any way.", "NTA your Father had a reason not to leave her anything and she has children who can take care of her or buy the house for her.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it's weird that your father has left her little but you don't know what happened between  them and you want to respect his wishes. You say you don't want his money and you pass it on to your daughter, which you're looking at for her future. Now, many say YOU look out for Penny, but how about her kids? Why don't they see for her? \n\nNow, can you give her some money? Yes, is it your obligation? No, it is not your obligation and you should not feel forced. However, if it is your wish you can do it.\n\nNow, I saw your comment about possibly your father leaving everything to you to make amends for the past, and I mean that probably makes a lot of sense.", "NTA but I understand why her family is upset.

She could fight to live there but she\u2019d never own it.\n\nOn the other matter, I\u2019m still ambivalent about going against what my father wanted. Whether his choice was right or wrong, it was his choice, that he made with a clear mind. He worked for that money and I sort of believe that he has a right to decide what happens to it. If I didn\u2019t believe that I\u2019d probably have donated all the money, but for whatever reason he wanted me to have it and I\u2019m respecting that in my own way. Im just not sure it feels right.", "Jeepers!! Heard of sympathy? She\u2019s newly widowed. That\u2019s the most stressful life event you can have, followed by moving house. Have a heart.", "Yeah but how is OP ta then?", "If I wanted it, I\u2019d dissolve the trust and use the money. I\u2019m not going to. My father wanted me to have the money, so I will respect his wishes and keep it, but it will go to my daughter. I\u2019ll never see a penny of it. So no, I don\u2019t secretly want it.\n\nAnd being the owner of a house opens a lot of drama, admin-wise. I don\u2019t know if Penny would be considered a tenant, which would mean I might be responsible for upkeep if not bills, and all sorts. It\u2019s a legal headache, all while giving me no closure to this situation.", "It\u2019s not the \u201cold lady\u2019s\u201d house. It belongs to OP.", "I\u2019ve been told that due to the circumstances of their relationship and the trust, she wouldn\u2019t have a case to go for money. It\u2019s not easy to contest a trust even if you have grounds. She could get residency of the house but with no income she couldn\u2019t afford the bills so that wouldn\u2019t be a good option for her. \n\nAs for giving Penny money, I am not sure how I feel about going against what my father wanted. For better or worse, he worked for that money, he knew what he wanted to happen to it. I have complicated feelings about who he was and I don\u2019t know why he did what he did but he made a choice. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right to go against that.", "Yeah?

Or maybe he felt his child should be the inheritor of his estate which is a legitimate reason too.  For all we know penny knew this all along.\n\nIf she did contest and was allowed to live there, it doesn\u2019t mean OP wouldn\u2019t have to manage the upkeep of the house and that is what they don\u2019t want.  \n\nOffer it to her and if no deal, sell.  I feel for this woman but she wasn\u2019t anyone to OP - they are under no obligation to secure her living situation.", "Granted, any will can be contested.

She didn\u2019t work and lived off OPs father for 7 years. She didn\u2019t contribute to the cost of the house or the taxes or upkeep. OPs father probably recognized she was freeloading off him  and would try to do so after he died since he updated the will a year ago.  Penny is not entitled to the house or his money. There were not married and her name was not added to the house. Her kids can either help her buy the house or buy her another or she can live with them.", "Ok so ask yourself this can you give some of the money from the sale of the house to move Penny out to a new place?

Then should could have made her own, fully-informed decision about whether or not sticking around was a good idea. She was likely under the false impression that he intended to provide for her.", "If you would happily give the money to charity, why not give some of it to her? It seems odd to stand on the principle that your father didn't leave her anything, so she has to be left without a cent.

As long as you just profit off it that's all that matters", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel going against what my father wanted\u201d. \nBut you are going against him; he left the money to YOU and you are giving them all to your daughter. So, you are just a hypocrite. \nSince you don\u2019t want the money, and clearly you don\u2019t need them, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t let them be in a bank account for years, then you are going against your father\u2019s wishes. \n\nSince we now established that, and you say it\u2019s ok to do it, now we have the question of are you going to be charitable to your father\u2019s widow? Because for 7 years she has been his free caretaker. So, if I was her, I would go after the estate for unpaid labour. \nSkip the lawyer part and the court part and give her whatever a live-in caretaker makes in your father\u2019s home country or to yours. Whichever amount is highest. This woman took care of your father for 7 years. Possibly exploited. Be a good person and pay her for those 7 years. \nOtherwise, yes, you are continuing the injustice and YTA.", ">I am not sure how I feel about going against what my father wanted.\n\nWhy? You weren't close, by your own admission. You are making a decision to go along with his plan. If her kids are well off & have the means to help her, that would be important information. It doesn't sound like your life would be altered much by making provisions for her to have another place to live.\n\nYou should own up to the fact that you are making the decision to put her out of her home. Shrugging it off as, \"I'm just doing what my father wanted\" is a weaselly excuse.", "I suppose both, in his own way. He could be a very petty and vindictive person, he was also the best person to have in your corner. He was very eccentric - had an enviable art collection but insisted he could afford to replace his toaster. His mind worked in a way I don\u2019t think anyone fully grasped.", "Maybe he didn't want to divorce her because he didn't want to split his money with her.\n\nMaybe she was refusing to sign the divorce papers.\n\nWe don't have enough information to judge him", ">Penny does not work and was financially dependent on my father, so while the lawyers say she could fight to stay living in the house, she likely can't afford legal counsel.\n\nThis seems to imply that the lawyers believe Penny has more than just the ability to contest the will but the ability to potentially win if she were to contest it. It really seems like OP is relying on her not having the means to hire legal representation rather than relying on her not actually legally being entitled to stay in the home.", "> How is she entitled?\n\nOP's lawyers seem to be telling her that Penny could be legally entitled to remain living in the house. Don't ask me, I'm not the one telling OP that Penny might be legally entitled to live in the house. \n\n>He had been married to his widow, Penny, for about 7 years before\n\nNot sure why I bothered responding to you when you seem confused about information that is stated in the very first sentence of the post, though.", "OP - I too was wondering if you could somehow help her out $ a bit?  I know it's not what your father wanted (for unknown reasons between him & Penny), and she's now gone off on you for being evicted and you don't need any of this bs.  I feel for you.  Good luck and please let us know how this mess works out for you.", "But the widow can't keep up the maintaince costs and probably not property taxes, etc.  So I can see both sides.  That's going to be an ongoing struggle with the widow.", "She does not want to support her father's wife, it is her right to sell the house and avoid expenses that are not hers.", "Why is it OPs responsibility though?", "I disagree. There are no circumstances that make what he did here okay to me. I'm not saying he should have left her everything or most things or even half of things, but leaving her next to nothing... dick move.", "I'm not an expert, far from it.  (but I'm going to weigh in anyway).  It sounds like Penny (depending on where she lives) may have squatter rights since she's lived in that house for (I'm assuming here) a long time.  But I think that's separate from the will itself which states that the property and other money goes to OP.  So she could fight to stay in the house, but I don't think she could fight the will itself.", "Not the OP's responsibility to provide for Penny now.  Penny should go out and get a job rather than assume she'd be taken care of.", "There are a great many things that we are perfectly within our rights to do that still make us TA.", "Never said it was.

But you're saying OP is \n\n>legally within your rights\n\nwhich seems like a bit of a stretch when OP seems to be leaning pretty heavily on this person simply not being able to afford to access the rights they may be entitled to. \n\nJust because someone can't sue you for what is theirs, that doesn't mean you're legally entitled to it. OP seems to know that Penny could have a valid legal claim here, but simply is too poor to have that claim enforced.", "I don't think in this case, can you explain to me why you think she is?", "What was the purpose of your comment if it wasn't to try and guilt trip OP?", "If you don't want a partnership and want to play \"every man for himself\" then don't get married in the first place.", "Penny doesn\u2019t have a valid claim. She was in the will for a nominal amount, so she can\u2019t say she received nothing as an oversight. It is very difficult to contest a trust no matter what legal counsel you have.

My partner and I agreed that I would be the primary income and possibly the sole income. If I die before him, it would be a dick move to leave him with next to nothing because \"he didn't earn it\". He is my partner. I *chose* to have a partnership and share my assets/life. If things don't go the way I hope, then I don't get to pretend later that this wasn't a choice I made.\n\nThis man had an adult daughter when he got married. He wasn't a naive kid who didn't understand the implications of marriage. If you want to keep separate lives instead of partnership then don't get married in the first place.

And if you don't, you're an AH.", "I\u2019m not relying on anything. If she gets a lawyer and goes for residence, I can\u2019t do anything about that and if she won the case I\u2019d abide by the law.

Either way, her not being able to do it and her not being entitled to do it are very different. \n\nPeople in this thread are acting like she's in the wrong for wanting to stay in the house, when your own lawyers are telling you the law might entitle her to stay in the house.
