Your lawyers say she could challenge the eviction and believe you me there will be lawyers out there very happy to take her case on contingency (or even pro bono).   I'd negotiate with her to encourage her to leave with a smile on her face - say $10,000 to help cover her relocation expenses or something like that.

And as you are - rightly - unwilling to take on that extra cost and burden, then there's nothing left to do here but sell the house. \n\nOne thing I might suggest is to offer her and/or her kids the first chance to buy the house. If her kids are so concerned about their mother, THEY can buy the house from you at a fair price and take on the cost and hassle of maintaining the house.

Is someone talking to you?  Bc I dont hear anyone speaking to you.\n\nThis was a woman your father cohabitated with.  No relationship to you.  You owe her nothing.

He certainly created an uncomfortable situation for both of you.\n\nIn any case, you are NTA. You have no interest in maintaining the house, and Penny would be financially unable to maintain it even if you gifted it to her. So selling it is clearly the best approach.\n\nThat said, you aren't obligated to follow your father's wishes. You could be more generous toward Penny than he was, if you choose to be. I don't think vicious messages from her children would inspire me to feel generous, but perhaps you are kinder than I am.", "NTA. \n\nNo idea why your father did what he did, but since he did it a year before he passed and was with her for 7 years, it feels intentional. \n\nBut that doesn't really matter either. It is your money and up to you to decide what to do with all of it. That means you get to decide how you want to spend it and how/if you want to help. \n\nI think there are two things you could do if you feel guilty or just want to look forward in your life knowing you were the \"bigger person\" or just right with the universe.  So, if I was in your position, I might offer Penny and her family the house at the exact market value or a little under. Alternatively, I might give Penny some money so that she can find another place to live and move comfortably. Not like half the value of the house or anything, but based on the cost of living in that country/area, paying for her moving expenses, and like first, last, security on an apartment would be an amazing gesture.\n\nIt is all about what feels right to YOU, not about being an AH/not an AH at all, just to be clear. You are NTA in any way, I'm just offering an additional little bit of advice here.", "NTA - Your father left this to you and his intentions were clear. Penny\u2019s kids should be more focused on finding a place for their mother to live than with you.", "NTA she got kids they can take care of her.. if your father did that a year before he passed I believe there was more to it. Believe your dad because that right there was a statement on how he felt. She was probably already counting on that for her and her kids and said some shady stuff that alarm your father.. DO NOT feel bad.", "> I have notified her via the lawyers of the intention to sell the house, which has led to vicious and vitriolic messages from her kids calling me evil and heartless\n\nthere's a simple solution here, her kids can buy the house for her.\n\nIf her own children are not willing to support her, why would they expect you to?  \n\nNTA", "NTA - I'm sorry for your loss and I understand you want to bring closer. Your reasons and actions are sound. Just because her children reacted negatively does not make their perspective right. Its time for Penny and them to create a solution. This is not on you. Continue to do what is necessary to move this along through your lawyers. Best to you.", "NTA unless you are selling it immediately without any time allotted for her to find other accommodations.  Have you considered offering to sell it to her for slightly below market value as a gesture of goodwill?

Or even sell it to her at a reasonable price?\n\nFrom other comments, it seems your father may have simply been capricious. I can absolutely see where Penny, and her family, feel like you're screwing her over, but I'm extremely empathetic to not wanting to deal with the estate.\n\nWhen you have the money to ignore his, leave a trust fund for your daughter, etc. then it would literally cost you nothing, in real terms, to just *give* her the inheritance instead.", "I understand that your estranged father left you everything but also do you have a heart? Your dad sounds like a cold hearted person and it sounds like you didn\u2019t care for him much either. His widow is now left fending for herself and depended on him. You could at least give her a chunk of the money you make off the house so she can at least afford an apartment til she figures things out. You said so yourself that you don\u2019t care about your father or his money.", "Perhaps if there is enough you could help her purchase a more budget friendly home or apartment so she downsizes appropriately for her age, and something her kids could help her maintain. Or at least 6 months rent", "NTA. Can you buy Penny a much smaller property in her name that she can afford to maintain? Or offer to cover her rent for a year? If your dad had a heart, he probably would made arrangements to not leave her homeless after his passing.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to house her, but it would be a kindness.", "NTA\n\nThe house will sell for more unoccupied, no retail buyer will buy the house and then go through an eviction. Also someone moving out can do a considerable amount of costly damage that is hard to \u201cprove\u201d they did and the chance of recovering damages if you can may be very low.  \n\nI would suggest it is in your own personal financial interest to make a generous offer to move.  Pay for moving, deposit on a new place, first months rent, and maybe a small amount of cash from the trust.", "NAH. I can see why she is upset and why you want to wash your hands of the situation. Since you don\u2019t want the money and don\u2019t seem to particularly like your father, why not just give her the house and let her deal with the upkeep or sell it? While she doesn\u2019t have a legal right to it, it would be the kind thing to do since it seems like your father deliberately left her in a bad situation. You wouldn\u2019t be the AH if you didn\u2019t give it to her though.", "NTA. I could see how maybe without context it sounds bad, but you seemed to have gone through the proper channels to notify her and everything. You are not responsible for Penny or her life choices.", "NTA.\n\nMany wheels within wheels here.  But the bottom line is it's your property and you have no obligation to make it available to Penny, still less maintain it at your expense.  Cut ties. Sell.", "NTA.  Your father set this up, you are under no obligation to do other than what will provides.  You may need a lawyer to evict her", "NTA. Your dad did this on purpose, you're just left holding the bag.\n\nBTW I'm sure there are options between let her live in the house forever and kick her out on the street with nothing available, perhaps talk to the lawyers about them if you want to be a better person than your dad was...", "NTA", "SOOO NTA.\n\nYour father left everything to you, not her. If he wanted her to have it he would have left it to her. The fact that she cannot afford the house so YOU would be paying for her and it is not even in the same country as you... I would do the same. Penny's situation is not your problem. I would, for my own morality, tell her I was selling the house and advise that the entire estate was left to you so nothing is out of left field.\n\nShe will probably cry and scream about it but I would also find out the value of the house, give a little discount below that and offer her to buy it but she has until x date to get that all done at that price otherwise it goes on the market. \n\nits not fair to you to have to pay for someone else to live in YOUR house.", "NTA as she was in the will left with something so she couldn't contest. If it was he didnt update it for those 7 years just because he didn't get around to it then borderline yes but technically no. Its weird to call her his widow since he didnt want her to have any of his stuff after 7 years.", "NTA, your father made his decision and it's not on you to just give a valuable house to someone you have very little relationship with. Mostly, it's bad of your dad to leave his wife out of his will entirely if she was financially dependant on him. Maybe it was just an oversight on his part and he intended to give her something, but there's no way for you to know now. Even then, there's a good chance it wouldn't have been the entire house.\n\nMaybe offer to give her a portion of the inheritance/house price if you're feeling generous. Not that there should be any expectation on you to do so, but if as you say you don't really need the money and it's a very valuable house, then a generous gesture may help to reduce the tensions.\n\nInheritance issues like this always suck, my dad went through a similar thing with his sisters when my grandfather died. Best of luck with it, and sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nIt's not as if she can maintain the house and it's right down the street. It's in another country and she cannot afford to live there. If her kids are that concerned, they can take her in or buy her the house/a place to live. She is not your responsibility and there's a reason your dad did what he did.", "NTA. But you could do an act of kindness for your father's widow, someone whom he loved. Especially since you say you don't need the money - and have inherited the entire estate, including the house. \n\nSell the house.  You're probably right that you can't look after it from another country, and continue to be responsible for its upkeep. Put most of it into a trust for your daughter. But if Penny doesn't have a legal right, I think it's arguable that she has a moral right to a share in the house, given that it is her residence, and she has put her work into it. Use a portion of the estate either to buy Penny a modest place, or set her up with rent for a couple of years - depending on what is feasible. Or maybe you could consider allowing her to live there rent-free, and put some of the estate into management of the property, via an agent, since you can't manage it yourself.\n\nAre you certain, BTW, that she has no legal claim on the house? My sister died recently, and her will divided everything between her son and her long-term partner - but left the house they lived in 100% to her son. That was something my sister and partner both agreed upon, imagining they had 30 years ahead together.  Under New Zealand law (where she lived), her partner could claim half the house, regardless of the will; this did not involve any kind of legal contestation, as half the house was his by law. We worked it out as a family, that he could live rent-free in the house indefinitely, and also gave him a portion of the estate to manage it and retire debts against it; and in return he didn't claim half the house. Everyone walked away happy (or as happy as they could be in these awful circumstances).", "NTA\n\nIgnore the kids.   Block them, in fact.  Get her moved out and close that chapter in your life for your and your daughter's sake.", "NAH\n\nYour father's will is his will. It's what he wanted. Abiding by the deceased's wishes in this case does not make you an a-hole.\n\nYour father created this situation. He painted both you and his widow into opposing corners. And who knows what he was telling her while alive. This seems to have caught her off guard and I can understand her children's reaction. Maybe they're just gold-diggers or maybe they're livid that their mother would be so discarded by her husband in death.\n\nThere's a lot of unknowns here but I'm left wondering what happened a year ago that he made this move to almost completely exclude her from an inheritance.", "NTA. If your dad made the decision to leave everything to you, Penny and her kids have to respect that. Her kids are just mad that they now have to take in/support their mom, when they falsely believed your dad would take care of her financially and otherwise for the rest of her life.", "NTA. Your father made his choices and your respecting that. His widows problems are her own.", "Honestly seems like ESH to me. Imagine treating your wife this way, honestly so shitty of your father to do this", "Overall, if this happened to me and I didn't care about the money from my father, I'd seek a dialogue with the widow and seek to find a solution where she covers the costs. Perhaps her family can do that while you retain ownership. Equally, perhaps not, but what is there to lose by trying?\n\nIf you truly mean what you say, then her not keeping the property in top condition won't matter to you as it having a higher or lower value then doesn't matter as you expected nothing from your father anyway.\n\nSo...the question is how honest you really are when you write \"I don't want my father's money\" because it sure sounds like you didn't expect it, but now that you have it, you definitely want it.\n\nSo...YTA. Kicking old ladies out of their home is always going to be a AH move.", "This story makes little sense. Your rather distant father was married to this woman, but made a will that would leave her broke & homeless? I don't buy it. Where large estates are concerned, there are usually lawyers willing to work pro-bono for a cut of whatever they can claw back from the will.\n\nI guess your father would be the real AH here, but there is nothing preventing you from selling the house & using some of the proceeds to set up a trust in Penny's name, so you can live with a clean conscience.\n\nYTA for going along with your father's cruelty.", "Yeah, NTA.  It sucks but that's your father's fault, not yours.  You shouldn't be obligated to pay for the upkeep of a house you don't even want.  I agree with the other commenters - Penny's kids can take her in or help her find a new place.", "NTA. Tell her and her kids to speak to your lawyer going forward.", "NTA\n\nTell her kids that keep calling you that they are more then welcome to support their own mother. You are not responsible for her in any way.", "NTA your Father had a reason not to leave her anything and she has children who can take care of her or buy the house for her.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it's weird that your father has left her little but you don't know what happened between  them and you want to respect his wishes. You say you don't want his money and you pass it on to your daughter, which you're looking at for her future. Now, many say YOU look out for Penny, but how about her kids? Why don't they see for her? \n\nNow, can you give her some money? Yes, is it your obligation? No, it is not your obligation and you should not feel forced. However, if it is your wish you can do it.\n\nNow, I saw your comment about possibly your father leaving everything to you to make amends for the past, and I mean that probably makes a lot of sense.", "NTA but I understand why her family is upset.

Would you want someone to assist you if you were in the same situation?", "NTA. This sounds like it is not the first time your father has left a mess for someone else to clean up. You are assuming a lot of responsibility for what your father has done, but you haven\u2019t done anything to Penny. Your father did. You seem to have some guilt about the potential motivations your father had at the time he made his will, and if you think he\u2019s truly done something Penny hadn\u2019t expected nor was prepared for, you could offer her some kind of assistance. But again, you are not responsible for her circumstances and anything you do for her would just be you being a good person and in no way solving problems not of your making.", "I\u2019m sorry but, by law: you\u2019re entitled to do whatever you want with the house. If her kids are so worried about her having to move out, you could sell it to them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so, NTA. I am curious, though: where do you guys live? Typically the spouse inherits at least 50% of the estate in most US states and territories", "NTA.  What are you supposed to do?  Apparently your dad wasn't particularly worried about her predicament, either.  You have to live your life and she is responsible for hers.  Unless you wanted to give her the house so you don't have to deal with it - that's the only other option that I see.", "NTA. \n\nIf your Father wanted Penny to have the house he would\u2019ve put it in his will.\n\nYou could perhaps offer for Penny to buy the house from you, and if she can\u2019t afford to, well, I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s not your issue. It\u2019s your house to do with what you wish, it\u2019s not your job to house your estranged Father\u2019s wife.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound harsh, but life really is a struggle sometimes.", "YTA. What trauma? You said you spoke regularly to your father. You also know he could be vindictive and might leave his widow penniless over some small offense. Plus you don\u2019t need the money (or the art collection) so don\u2019t tell us you can\u2019t keep up a house - or a smaller condo - for his widow. Be better than your father. Give the widow lifetime use of this or a smaller property with it then passing to your daughter on the widow\u2019s death. Or just admit you are as big an AH as your father.", "I would ask if they are interested at first. Almost certain they will balk and yell that they clearly can't afford to buy it. That way you avoid having to flash the number you have coming to you in their faces. I can't imagine much good coming from that.", "I think this is one of those situations where you have to consider if you can live with your own decision. OP may be legally in the clear, but this is a deeply personal moral question, since the dad sounds like a horrible man who forced OP to play a cruel game upon his death. OP admits it is possible that this whole inheritance could have been a vindictive act of revenge against the wife for something very minor. \n\nIt is very cruel to have left his wife,who was financially dependent on him, in a completely vulnerable state, and OP neither wants nor needs the money. While this is OP's choice to make, they have to decide if they want to play an unwilling role in their father's twisted games or perhaps sign the house over to the late wife just for their conscience's sake.", "Exactly! So bizarre. My step brother doesn\u2019t inherit his mothers house until my father dies.", "I imagine father assumed her children would take her in", "No he wasn\u2019t. He was only married to her for seven years. He had made his income and everything well before he met her, so why would he leave it to her? Of course, it makes sense for him to leave it to his actual child.", "I'm sure he's smiling, thinking about how he used OP to ensure that his wife's punishment would endure beyond his own death.", "I\u2019m more concerned about her or her kids intentionally damaging the home, so I agree.", "I'm thinking buy it, or rent it at a rate that would cover taxes, insurance, and some annual upkeep. \n\nI suppose OP is within their rights, but I would think long and hard about whether I wanted to be the kind of person who would turf a recent widow out of her home of 7+ years.", "I agree with NTA but the legality of it is entirely irrelevant, this isn't r/legaladvice. People come here for moral questions, not legal ones.", "Agreed but what bad reasoning", "> Your father chose to take everything away from his current wife.\n\nMore likely, he never gave it to her in the first place.  The will is pretty recent but that doesn't mean she was in the old one.  She probably wasn't, and he rewrote it only to make sure she couldn't contest it.", "He married her.  They were not just cohabiting.", "Penny has no income, so she can't afford to maintain anything.  She can't pay property taxes, or utilities, or buy food or clothing.  Her kids should take her in.", "His health declined slightly in the last year. Not to where we knew it would be the end, but I think he just became wary of his situation.", "The wife has no income.  How is she going to keep up such a large home?  That burden would still fall on OP who doesn't want to deal with a home in another country.  \n\nAlso, it is obvious that OP's father had some good reason for screwing over his wife.  That is the intent of the will and should be honored.  \n\nI admit that I do not have much respect for women who aren't acquainted with words like job, career, or work.", "I guess the reason why it's unlikely to happen is that they had zero relationship, so it's just a random unemployed woman who she never knew and who lived with op's father. Plus now there's angry kids of that woman in the picture, which would move the relationship from zero to negative. So giving chunk  of money to random person feels strange. \n\nHowever, i would personally think that offering kids to buy house or giving her money for 2-3 months rent would still be right decision. It's not going to cost much, but might save some headache.", "> His widow is now left fending for herself and depended on him.\n\nYou know what?  That's on her.  She signed a prenup and she still didn't take any steps to secure her own future.  She can go live with one of her kids.", "There was a prenup it\u2019s in one of the comments.", "I wonder if OP's father would have written it differently if Penny had worked and contributed to the household expenses while they were married.", "Who is supposed to pay for the house upkeep, taxes, etc. Or is OP supposed to sign over the house to the widow?", "How long should OP support this widow?  She signed a prenup and she still didn't work while OP's father was supporting her.  She could have been saving for her own future during all that time.  OP has no reason to suppose she's going to suddenly go get a job and contribute to the substantial expenses of maintainin a large home.", "Thank God some one said it. Thank you.", "From the description of the house it sounds like widow's problem is not that she has no place to live, but that she would like to stay in the very expensive house that she never had rights for. She has kids after all. imo it would be right of OP to give her some rent money, but either keeping the house, allowing her to live there and paying the bills or gifting her house and having her sell it since she has no money for upkeep is just unreasonable. OP has a daughter, those money would be useful for her future. \n\nAnyway, i agree it's shitty that she has to move out, but from the info we have she's an unknown woman to op, who never worked, never contributed to the said house, never had children to explain why she had no job, so it doesn't sound like she put anything in her rather short marriage with OP 's father. It's unfortunate, but she also doesn't seem like a poor widow from Disney cartoon. What did she expect really? Usually will is aimed at children.\n\nShe was living at expense of OP's father and now expects that responsibility to care for her financially passed to the next person in family or what?", "I\u2019m sorry, are you suggesting I write out all my childhood trauma for you dissect to see whether it qualifies? Or are you implying that because I chose to maintain a semblance of a relationship with my father, that he must have been a stand up guy and a good parent? Or that because we spoke, that means I am not allowed to say I experienced trauma? Whichever it is, I think that is an insensitive and myopic view on familial relationships. \n\nMy father was a complicated person, with a lot of different sides to him, and he never should have been a parent. Nevertheless, he was one to me. That doesn\u2019t mean he was a good one, but he was the best father he was capable of being. Just because I chose to have him in my life in a small way, that doesn\u2019t disregard everything that happened. Nor does it mean I owe it to strangers to elaborate. \n\nThe rest of your judgement is your opinion.", "If the house is in US it is public information they can just go to Zillow or the county tax assessor Gis database to see what it sold for.", "That just seems very cruel on his part. I also wonder if she even knew that he planned to leave her in such a horrible, vulnerable state upon his death.... I won't lie. I feel great empathy for this woman.\n\nIt sounds like your father was not a nice man. If there is even a chance that he did this action out of spite and to hurt another human being who may be completely innocent, I would want no part of it it I were you. I would leave her with the house for my conscience's sake. You say you do not need or want the money, and it feels dirty to you, so perhaps consider signing it over to her, washing your hands of it legally and moving on. She can sell it, keep it, or rent it. But, I don't think I would want to play any part in helping this man hurt someone else.", "It sounds like you and Penny have something in common. You've both been treated very badly by your father. \nYou have no obligation to her. You're NTA. But perhaps you could take this opportunity to be merciful to her and use the proceeds of the house to purchase a small house or apartment since you do not need the money at this time. Penny could live in it for rent or cost. You could hire a rental management company that the tenant could pay for so you don't have to be involved.\n Once Penny passes, you could sell it. It might be a good investment.", "It's they can't afford to the upkeep, just sell the house before it goes down in value, and split the proceeds if that would give you peace of mind. NAH", "Wow. Thats not just peculiar it's absolutely abhorrent. He could have at least set aside enough for her to have a small apartment or something.\n\nNTA, but your father sure is", "Op says he was a \u201cpeculiar man.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite penny did something small to irritate him one day and this is how he took his revenge.\u201d Sounds like Op is well aware of her fathers ability to be cruel and heartless.", "OP states in her comment that it\u2019s \u201cquite possible\u201d Penny did something small to irritate him, and he did this to get his revenge.", "OP says they don't want anything from their father, that indicates to me that he was a huge asshole when he was alive.", "We never know all the circumstances, but we know he was an asshole.", "If you marry someone, presumably you love them and would want them to have a good life. Potentially losing their home and being homeless is not something you set your spouse up for.\n\nAlso, if she was a STAHW then she gave up the chance to earn her own money for unpaid labour to benefit him. So he screwed her over.", "She owes nothing to Penny. It's that simple", "It doesn\u2019t feel right because it isn\u2019t right. He was an asshole who deliberately set his own wife up to be destitute when he died. Unless he was also planning a divorce before he died that is despicable on his part.\n\nBy following through with this by \u201cfollowing his wishes\u201d you\u2019re basically letting him win. You should do the right thing. You don\u2019t owe your father anything, especially if his \u201cwishes\u201d were to do the wrong thing.", "You\u2019re NTA but please reflect on how little sense this argument makes. It\u2019s your money now and yours to decide what to do with. As you mentioned multiple times you\u2019re giving the money to your daughter, who your father did not leave it to. You can\u2019t reallocate some of it and say that\u2019s okay but not reallocate other portions bc \u201che wanted you to have it\u201d.  Saying oh I have no choice but to accept this large sum of money and give none of it to charity bc that\u2019s what my estranged father wanted just come across illogical and unauthentic. It\u2019s your money now, you decide. \n\nIMO, penny shouldn\u2019t have made a second marriage later in life with no kids and a prenup her retirement plan, and I don\u2019t actually have that much sympathy for her tbh so NTA again but yeah, the logical leaps you made there aren\u2019t it.", "Your dads choice was an AH move.  You have the decision to make if you want to honour his choice or not.", "Oh, please!  She obviously did something that really pissed OP's father off and the will is written specifically to see that she gets her just desserts.  \n\nThe intent of the will needs to be followed. Again, I have little sympathy for women who sit on their ass when they could be contributing.", "Why does he care if she keeps it up or not though? He's made it very clear he wants nothing to do with it. He's also made it pretty clear he and his father weren't close, so why bother with his \"intent?\" OP should prioritize his ease, not what a dead guy he didn't have much to do with sprang on him.\n\nI would find it easier to just offload it all onto her and then, bam, it's her issue to figure out instead of his.", "Which comment?   And what did the prenup actually say?  If it said she was entitled to half, or all, the assets, this could end very quickly.", "There's a vast middle ground to explore between calling the lawyers to communicate eviction or signing up the house to the widow as free gift. But reasoning and arguing through absolutes and extremes is always easier", "Right, I didn't mean at OP. To be fair though passing the house on to the Widow's family would have been the first thing I thought of in this situation.", "I agree that OP\u2019s father\u2019s actions sound unkind and ill-intentioned. However, OP said that Penny would not be able to maintain the house. If they choose to help Penny, the idea of getting a smaller house or apartment for a management company to maintain might make more sense.\n\nI did wonder though when OP stated that Penny has children. Why do they they think it is OP\u2019s responsibility to support their mother and not their own responsibility? Do they not have resources to pay for it? Were they hoping OP would gift Penny the house so they could move in or sell it?", "I came here to say much the same thing.", "Yeah I can see why OP doesn't want anything from his father, he's a damn monster if that's how he treats his wife who was financially dependent on him (which he probably insisted on for control)", "[removed]", "I came here to say much the same thing.", "I was thinking exactly the same thing. \nMy own mother is bouncing between my brother and sister (I live in another country) at 80 years old because she was left in a bad position after her husband died.

Why should he give any more money to the people that are literally harassing him and calling him names?", "This is what I would do.

Whether his choice was right or wrong, it was his choice, that he made with a clear mind. He worked for that money and I sort of believe that he has a right to decide what happens to it.
