Things have been going well I think. Her roommate has moved out of state and now my girlfriend needs a place to stay temporarily (we both work and live in a fairly large city - i.e. not easy to find affordable arrangements). \n\nMy place is pretty spacious, yes. However it\u2019s just not suitable for anything more than 1 person. My uncle gave me this loft (and the 50% of assets he didn\u2019t donate to charity) and was a bachelor all his life, which is definitely how the space is intended to be used. If I had to pay for a similar space in this part of the city, it would be $5-6k+ rent, i.e. 30-35% of my pre tax pay, so I definitely don\u2019t want to move anytime soon.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what a loft is, my bedroom is on another floor from the living room/kitchen area, but there\u2019s no physical wall between them. This means you can literally *hear* everything. Great for living by myself, not tolerable with anyone else long term. That would mean I can\u2019t play on my pc in the bedroom late at night or watch tv in the living room. If you wake up in the middle of the night and want a quesadilla, you can definitely smell what\u2019s being cooked in the kitchen and hear the blower. There\u2019s also very little privacy anywhere besides the bathroom. I\u2019m sure there are some entire families living in arrangements like this, but there are also families living in huts or closet apartments in Hong Kong.\n\nMy girlfriend would have to commute 70-80 minutes to get here from her parents house. However she assured me she would only need 3 months to find a place so it\u2019s not as if that\u2019d be a long term situation. There\u2019s plenty of people who commute everyday, it\u2019s no big deal. I really don\u2019t think she has any reason to be so upset with me about not wanting to do this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698176024, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fl6ug/aita_for_not_letting_my_girlfriend_crash_at_my/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How often are you waking up at night to make quesadillas? \n\nPart of living with someone is living with their sounds, plenty of couples live in a studio and make it work well.", "I'm probably gonna be in the minority, but YTA for a specific reason. The fact that you care more about not being able to play video games at night than the fact that your girlfriend has to find a place to live temporarily says everything I need to know.", "YTA.\n\nWe get it - you aren't really into your gf and don't care if she has to commute over an hour every morning and evening, so long as you can play games at night.\n\nWhy haven't you broken up with her already? You clearly have no intentions of ever marrying her or moving in with her, you're just stringing her along.", "YTA\n\nDo you love this person and see a future with them someday or is she just a fuck buddy to you?  \n\nIf you love her I can't imagine how you'd think it's ok to be so callous in her moment of need. If you don't love her or see a real future with her, maybe it's time to sit down and have a talk so she can decide if she's cool with that or can move on to someone who does. \n\nThe inconveniences you list pale in comparison to that long of a commute.  You think it's reasonable for her to spend over two hours a day a day driving so you don't have maybe get some headphones to watch TV at night?  You might smell and hear cooking noises. Oh the humanity. \n \nAre you gonna be the type to get mad that she never has time to see you/fuck you anymore now that she spends all her waking hours working or driving? Then dump her for not being available. \n\nEverything you list is something you could work around for 3 months. I shared a loft with a bf in college and it's not the end of the world.", "YTA. How is it that youre two years in and the idea of sharing a space with your girlfriend and making sacrifices is non negotiable to you. And its not even permanent in this case its 3 months. If you want long term relationship youre going to share a living space for a long time. You could have the person you love living with you for 3 months yet somehow thats an issue? I dont get that. I think most people would be jumping at joy for an opportunity to live with their partner", "YTA.\n\n\"My gf would have to commute 70-80 minutes to get here.\"\n\nAnd you think she'll be wanting to spend over an hour one way to drop by your place for bootycalls now that you've made clear it's all you see her as?  LOL", "YTA. It's a couple months of living together in a studio. It's not ideal but sometimes you deal with less than ideal for your SO, especially if it's someone you're in a long term relationship with. You could at least offer a month or two to see how it goes.\n\nPlus, you've been dating your gf for almost 2 years and it sounds like she's trying to sign another year long lease. If this isn't a place you can move your GF into, shouldn't you be thinking about how to rent it out so you can actually live with your GF?", "YTA. A selfish man like you doesn't deserve a girlfriend; hopefully she'll soon realize that.", "YTA and from the comments, just be single. You very very obviously don't give a flying fig about your gf.", "YTA, do you see yourself in a long term possibly marry to your girlfriend down the line? If so, I see no problem with letting her stay with you until she finds her own place no matter how long it'll take her because in the end you guys will be living together when you guys are marry right. Unless you plan on living in 2 separate place as well. Base on your reasons as to why you don't want her to move in, it seem as though you want to follow in your uncle footstep and stay a bachelor.", "So... you're unwilling to inconvenience yourself for just a few months so your girlfriend doesn't have to commute for hours every day?\n\nI assume you'll still expect her to come by for sex? After you're finished gaming, of course.\n\nIf she were just a friend or a fuck buddy, my vote would be NTA.\n\nAs she's your girlfriend of two years, I think she should dump your selfish ass. YTA.", "Your GF should urgently seek another BF", "Depends. Do you see a long-term future with the woman? She will more than likely leave you for this, and you will deserve it.

All of your concerns are about video games and cooking in the middle of the night. Have you even told her about these and gotten her feedback? \n\nAlso, at 2 years, has there been any discussion about finding something together?  \n\n\nYTA for making this about your desire to game and cook during the night than seeing your girlfriend.

Your post sounds a lot like \"my effing buddy who thinks that she is my girlfriend wants to live with me for a short while, but I rather let her commute 70 to 80 minutes anytime I feel the need to fuck her than to actually live in a relationship.\"\n\nYTA", "NAH, but you will probably be single.  Couples live in lofts all the time.  It isn't like your living space is that unique.    \n\n\nI find it hard to believe that you will force your GF of two years to commute 2 - 3 hours each day.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu will be single soon.", "YTA\nYour girlfriend is in a time of need, and although there is nothing wrong with wanting your own space, the reasons you list as being the issues with her moving in are soooo easily fixable. You can wear headphones while you game, and of the keyboard clacking is too noisy and she is trying to sleep, she can wear earplugs. Or you might even limit yourself to just one or two hours of gaming a night (insane thought, not really, being able to spend two hours on my hobbies EVERY DAY is a dream, and you are already complaining about \u00abonly\u00bb getting 3-4). \nYou can communicate with your girlfriend, and set expectations for what her living there would look like (presumably you have spent time together before, and know eachother and your routines pretty well after being together for 2 years, maybe you guys even have spent some night together before). You can talk to her about how it is important for you to have some time on your gaming, and figure out a solution instead of just assuming its not gonna work. \n\nBut what really sealed the YTA-deal for me is that you\u2019re even admitting that 3 months is a very conservative estimate, and that most likely she would not need to live there that long and will have found somewhere else to live by then. \n\nIt seems like you do not care about your girlfriend at all.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re making your long term girlfriend commute over two hours each day (assuming the 70-80 minutes is one way) because you\u2019re too concerned about your gaming time and\u2026late night quesadillas. That\u2019s what this boils down to. You\u2019re adding the stress of a long commute on to her plate because you don\u2019t want to compromise on what hours you play your game. \n\nAre you technically within your rights? Yeah. It\u2019s your apartment, you don\u2019t have to let her live there. If I was your girlfriend would I be pretty annoyed and questioning our relationship? Also yeah.\n\nAlso the whole \u201cother people have it worse\u201d doesn\u2019t make any behaviour okay.", "YTA if you can't make sacrifices for a few months.

She is apparently in a place in the relationship where completely shared space does not bother her. Seeing this, she might wonder if you two are going to have such a different pace throughout the whole relationship and she might not be willing to wait around to see. Again quite legit.  All the things you've listed are quite common and quite minor obstacles in a first cohabiting, if you are untrusting as to whether she leaves at the 3-month mark, that would be another issue, but again easily solved by a contract.  But you being so inflexible is just telling me you are not ready for this at all, which is fine, but there might be some consequences to your relationship.", "YTA", "YTA and you\u2019re also probably single very soon", "Yes! Your are the asshat! It would be different if you were only dating two months, but two years?

Her only other option is moving back with her parents, which few people who have moved out look forward to. She's not entitled to make you change your mind, but she might see this as a reason to believe you're not that committed to her, especially if she's thinking about the future and sees how much you like your bachelor pad and current lifestyle more than making room for her temporarily. It's an understandable reaction in any case. This apartment thing might just be highlighting that there's a fork on your relationship's road.\n\nThe thing is, reading this, I get a lot of details about your apartment and everything, and very little about her.

It sounds like you just really value your personal space and I dont think it's wrong to be uncomfortable with basically not having any in what's supposed to be your sanctuary (your home) for three months. There's also no guarantee that she will actually find a place in three months or wont use this as a trial to see what living together would like, but I do think you need to make sure you and your girlfriend are on the same page about what your future together looks like. You need to be honest so she can move on if your short term and long term goals don't align. It might be hard to hear but like others have said, based on the way you talk in your post you dont seem that crazy about her. If things are serious at some point you guys would likely be moving in together, and your current home doesnt give you enough space. You both have to willing to make some compromises. You also want to be clear that you do care for her and want to help her, but clearly explain what your needs with personal space and time for hobbies are. \n\nLots of people commute but as someone who has a long commute as well 70-80 minutes is a long time and I wouldn't be surprised if it builds some resentment in her over this.

It's your home and if you won't be comfortable with her there, then that's reason enough to say no.

He was able to cook, drink, smoke on the patio without waking me up. I went to work early and never woke him up. \nIt\u2019s a compromise. You just sound straight up like you want the benefits of having a relationship with no real potential in keeping it. \nYour reasonings are crude and honestly just white lies you pulled out of your teeth to give some reason that you don\u2019t want her there when we all know the real reason. \nNo one is saying give up your hobbies.

I think you do need to be honest with her and let her know you are not ready to live with a significant other yet. There is nothing wrong with that, however, I think you should tell her.

You do NOT need to be her hero. That is not your job. You can still find ways to help and support her, but please do not feel obligated to allow her to force you into it.

Things have been going well I think. Her roommate has moved out of state and now my girlfriend needs a place to stay temporarily (we both work and live in a fairly large city - i.e. not easy to find affordable arrangements). \n\nMy place is pretty spacious, yes. However it\u2019s just not suitable for anything more than 1 person. My uncle gave me this loft (and the 50% of assets he didn\u2019t donate to charity) and was a bachelor all his life, which is definitely how the space is intended to be used. If I had to pay for a similar space in this part of the city, it would be $5-6k+ rent, i.e. 30-35% of my pre tax pay, so I definitely don\u2019t want to move anytime soon.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what a loft is, my bedroom is on another floor from the living room/kitchen area, but there\u2019s no physical wall between them. This means you can literally *hear* everything. Great for living by myself, not tolerable with anyone else long term. That would mean I can\u2019t play on my pc in the bedroom late at night or watch tv in the living room. If you wake up in the middle of the night and want a quesadilla, you can definitely smell what\u2019s being cooked in the kitchen and hear the blower. There\u2019s also very little privacy anywhere besides the bathroom. I\u2019m sure there are some entire families living in arrangements like this, but there are also families living in huts or closet apartments in Hong Kong.\n\nMy girlfriend would have to commute 70-80 minutes to get here from her parents house. However she assured me she would only need 3 months to find a place so it\u2019s not as if that\u2019d be a long term situation. There\u2019s plenty of people who commute everyday, it\u2019s no big deal. I really don\u2019t think she has any reason to be so upset with me about not wanting to do this.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Your choice. You\u2019ll probably lose your GF. Have you ever thought of just letting her know that she would have deal with your schedule?", "Technically NTA as it is your choice.  But she also now knows she cannot rely on you.   \n\nYou do not mention you commuting 70-80 minutes to see her.", "This is definitely a tough situation, but you're not in the wrong here. You have reasons why you wouldn't want your girlfriend living with you right now, and you're not obligated to change that. However, it might be worth considering some compromises to make the situation work, such as setting up a separate workspace for her and trying to find a way to cut down on the noise. If that's not possible, then it's understandable that you wouldn't want her to live with you for now.", "You\u2019re NTA for this kinda of but you do sound like an AH in general", "You don\u2019t sound committed..", "I mean...you're not necessarily an asshole per se, but if you can't put up your girlfriend of two years for three months, you both need to be asking whether you're in this for the long haul. NAH I guess but expect it to be the end of your relationship.", "Can I ask where you see this relationship in the long term? Two years is a long time if you don\u2019t plan on ever moving forward in your relationship. If after two years you aren\u2019t even willing to have her stay with you temporarily, why are you together? \n\nI mean, to each their own. Maybe you are both happy dating long term with no plans to live together or progress the relationship, but I couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to live together, I just find the idea of spending years with someone you don\u2019t like enough to even let live with you temporarily to be strange. Hopefully she\u2019s feeling the same as you and isn\u2019t hoping for more from this relationship since you obviously aren\u2019t interested and stringing her along wouldn\u2019t be kind.", "I mean your claiming you make between 350-421k per year.  Build a wall and put a door in.  \n\nNTA\n\nBUT IMMATURE AS HELL", "I think NAH. You\u2019re young and you\u2019re establishing boundaries you\u2019re comfortable with. I do think maybe you could be more open to her moving in part time until she gets set up in her own place. Like letting her come Mondays after work and stay until Friday mornings. That would be a way to cut down on her commute during the week. That way you can have some time to yourselves on weekends. Maybe it\u2019s also a good way for y\u2019all to get closer.

Your place, your rules, your decision. \n\nThat being said this makes you look horrible in her eyes.

But at the end of the day it's your place and your relationship. Whatever happens is on you.", "OP. Look at this from her perspective. After two years she wants to think you have her back.  In her time of need you can\u2019t be inconvenienced with video games, tv and quesadillas.", "If after two years you don't think you can live with your GF for a few months because you'd be uncomfortable, maybe it's time to let her go. She's not the one. YTA.", "Yes", "INFO: how old are you? If you're super young at least this explains why you think it's unclear why she's mad at you.\n\nBut here's the thing, unless you're super young, YTA because if you and your gf have been together two years nearly and you're not willing to help her out at all or talk about how to make this work, you're fundamentally ungenerous to her and she should get a better boyfriend.", "If you are not ready to share a space with your girlfriend after 2 years. \nWhat are you together for? \nIt basically signals that the relationship is a dead end for her.", "YTA and sexless soon", "Given you have been dating for a long time, and this request seems reasonable, YTA.

There's a lot of stories around here where people say \"they just need X months to find a new place\" and never leave. Stand your ground.", "Can you try a trial run, where maybe she stays a couple of nights at a time? She can move most of her stuff to her parents, and then just stay with you so you doesn\u2019t have to commute everyday? Maybe she\u2019d rather smell quesadillas at midnight and wear earplugs than spend 2+hours on the train everyday.", "Well, your honest at least. If I was your gf, it would make me wonder how committed you are after 2 years together. She isn\u2019t asking to live their forever, just long enough to get a place. You can\u2019t even be bothered to help. And your attitude that she can commute 70-80 minutes daily, lots of people do snd it\u2019s no big deal is what definitely made YTA.  She should definitely rethink this so called relationship.", "This man's living in 2050! Gotta have the quisdilla", "No I mean that my desk is on the second floor bedroom and even if I moved it downstairs you would still hear the clacking of my mechanical keyboard. \n\nI mean who knows how my day will go.

That's what i thought initially when he said that he doesn't want her to move in. it starts at 3 months then turn into 3 years.", "This! I was thinking the same.", "OP is NTA for not wanting to move in with his GF. Yes, he might not love her enough, and not serious about the relationship, but it doesn't make him an AH, it just makes them potentially incompatible.

Having someone in such a tight space can be a bit much.", "I feel like her was stating those instances to be nice.

If it's not what she wants, she is free to break up with him.", "Yeah you\u2019re an asshole not him.", "I never understood why people denigrate games like they\u2019re some totally unimportant triviality unlike any other hobby.

If she's a thoughtful person, I would also guess that she would probably try to function as a good guest and not be too disruptive to you.", "Alright, then NTA. But I suggest you two start discussing when to move in together into a bigger space if you want the relationship to continue because this isn't a good look relationship-wise.", "NTA - but don't list those reasons to her, as they're not solid, at all. To me it's obvious that you just don't want to share your living space with her, which is a valid reason. Tell her that.", "Yep.", "He doesn\u2019t need to plan he\u2019ll have no other choice. What a loser op is", "Don\u2019t gamers know you can use that wizardry and be in the same room as someone watching or playing something else.

Then you press them against your ear, and it\u2019s like they\u2019re *whispering* to you.", "Well now then it becomes her problem -\n\n\"Hey sure you can crash at my place - but you should know I play video games at night - you should get yourself a blindfold!\"", "Good thing they also make earplugs lmao", "For four fucking years. I developed multiple ear infections from trying to sleep through it with earbuds or earplugs. It was hell.", "The OP is making excuses rather than problem solving. Part of growing up is learning to solve problems such as setting up a gaming rig in the living room with all the money she is saving on rent.", "What\u2019s your plan when you want to live together? You should be thinking about this if you\u2019re serious about your relationship.", "Ah, neither my brother nor my boyfriend do that, so I forgot that was a thing. I have good men in my life.", "I need to let you know how much you suck at this game \ud83d\ude08", "Lol wow Stretch Armstrong", "i thought the same thing lol!", "If OP said he played golf for 4hrs a day, or went to the gym, or played DnD, the reaction would be the same as long as they were putting these hobbies over someone they claim to care about who needs a place to live.", "Imagine the meltdown when actual responsibilities come into play.", "I'm lucky if I get 4 hours a week and that's with multitasking. Heck, I've seen one complete TV show in the last two years (if you don't count kids shows)", "During winter I will wake up at 4am to start work at 6am so I can leave at 3 pm to go ski until 9pm. I do that 3 times a week on top of my weekends which are basically skiing from sunrise to 8pm. For most people that sounds insane. For me it still is not enough.", "You should swing by r/Cycling.  A daily four-hour bike ride is rookie numbers to those people.", "I spend far more than 4 hours a day on my hobbies, and I hold a decent full-time job. If his hobbies are important to him, that's all that matters.\n\nPersonally I've been in a position where a friend asked me if she could be my roommate cause she didn't want to live with her mom anymore and I told her no, because I wasn't getting rid of my music room.", "i do??", "In two games he plays, communication such as \u201ccalling out location of enemies, their health etc is important\u201d \nPinging doesn\u2019t do much(especially since most players don\u2019t look at the ping) but a ping can\u2019t tell you if they\u2019re cracked, healing, etc. now he\u2019s still the asshole for prioritizing them over her, I\u2019m just pointing out how headphones don\u2019t make a difference", "Oh, I wouldn't be considering. I would be long gone.", "I mean yea he's an asshole if he left her homeless but she has a place to go.", "[deleted]", "No, I\u2019ve been out of college 2 years. Currently 24. That\u2019s just the typical compensation for jr analysts in my field.", "I'm betting not, because if he told her, she would turn off the sex tap.", "He's 24! I think it's okay to not be thinking long term. His brain isn't even fully developed yet.", "He's 24. That's very normal.", "Because that is not the reason he gave, he gave a bunch of BS reasons, from gaming to quesadillas.", "Did he ask for it or was it left to him? Idk what bombshell you thought you dropped lol.", "This is not just someone. Presumably he loves her?", "OP cannot just move his mistress in! His Xbox will get jealous!", "Agree, to me OP\u2019s reasons are not solid if he genuinely wanted to live with his gf, and I highly doubt his gf will see them as solid either. Listing those as the reasons will probably seem like a cop out to her, and hurt more than just saying you\u2019re not ready to move her in for that long yet.", "Not if he needs to drop various N, F, and R words in order to properly play!", "I'm not commenting on the overall post because I don't care either way, I'm mentioning why even with headphones you'd have a hard time gaming with someone who wants to sleep in the same room", "Happy Cake Day! \ud83c\udf82", "At least golf wouldn't be so noisy he can't live with another human being.", "I think the key word here is \u201cfriend\u201d.

That\u2019s an entirely different scenario with entirely different implications.", "Horse girls have entered the chat. \n\nBut seriously, 10 pm - 2 am consistently is unreasonable if you hold a steady job with normal hours", "Honestly, I would be too. There were times in both of my marriages where I felt less important than video games, but not to the point where they wouldn't let me move in temporarily!! Those issues were also resolved with a small conversation about how I was feeling, but I doubt OP would be up for that.       \n\nSince this isn't just about gaming but also his special midnight quesadillas, I'm guessing OP would just prefer to stay a bachelor and have someone who comes around occasionally for sex. That's not a relationship, that's a fuck buddy.", "Imo making his long term gf live 70-80 minutes away from her work is just as bad (at least if she works in person more than once a week).", "It should be if he's open to it, which he apparently would be if he had more space.", "Haha wow, y\u2019all hiring? I kid, yea 24 is very young, and in the independent stage of life. I\u2019d still suggest letting her stay a couple times a week so she doesn\u2019t have to commute that far every single day. \n\nOthers are saying \u2018if she moves in she won\u2019t leave\u2019, I think that\u2019s a pretty unfair assumption considering we have no indication of that in your post. You know her better than any of us and have a better sense of how true that\u2019d be. In any case, having her stay only 1-2 nights a week would make that a non-issue, and be a good window into the relationship for when you get to the move into a new place together stage", "So what? I was already married when I was 24", "Then he should not be in a long-term relationship and just date around.  If you are going to date someone this long, you should be thinking about the future and if you don't see yourself with them long-term, you gotta move on.", "Take it up with him, not with me", "I think the relationship is done. No matter what he tells her all she will see is that she has been with him for 2 years and he would rather force her to commute 40 mins then live together for 3 months", "My partner games sitting next to me on the bed while I\u2019m asleep all the time. He wears headphones, I wear earplugs and a sleep mask. Problem solved.", "Idk how you define a \u201csteady job\u201d but I\u2019m a restaurant manager so yeah those are normal gaming hours for me.

At all ages, many people date for many years without plans to live together and without planning a future.

You don't need to project your personal relationship goals or beliefs on OP and his partner.", "Lame", "Yes and my SO is a social worker. Depends on OP's area, but in a lot of jurisdictions needing to crash with family over an hour away would make her legally homeless and qualify for a shelter.", "Presumably because you have to, not because you want to, right? People do a lot of shitty things because they can't afford otherwise.", "Probably not by choice though, right?", "Sorry for having fun with my friends I guess, to each their own!", "So you say you know people who suffered from homelessness and doubling down that having to commute to work is just as bad as being homeless. Do you really think people who sleep in their car or on the street wouldn't prefer to live in a home if that means gasp they have to drive to work.", "A little of both? It\u2019s where I could comfortably afford to buy a house, and it\u2019s closer to family. It\u2019s normal for a lot of people who work in a city and live in the suburbs.\n\nBy commuting from her parents\u2019 (supposedly for three months) OP\u2019s girlfriend isn\u2019t doing anything millions of people aren\u2019t already doing.", "Homelessness encompasses many more situations than just sleeping on the street. If your question is \"is shelter 1.5 hours away better than the street\", yes. However, if her next stop was the street instead of someone's couch OP could still help her find a homeless shelter before moving her in.\n\nImo, OP would be TA for making her sleep in a shelter, even though she'd still have a roof over her head. He is also, imo, TA for making her commute 3 hours a day for shelter so that he can play video games loudly at night.", "That wasn't my question my question was clear based off your comment saying making her commute is just as bad as being homeless. \n\nMy question was are you being serious saying commuting an hour to work is just as bad as being homeless. I get you don't wanna admit being wrong but come on that's absurd. Because we're not talking about a shelter shes living with her parents. \n\nAlso stop treating this woman like a child saying OP \"making her\". She needs a place to live and didn't find an apartment quick enough after her roommate moved. She's making herself commute an hour to work by not being on top of her own responsibilities"]}
