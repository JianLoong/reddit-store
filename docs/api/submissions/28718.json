Due to the hybrid work model, I work from home 3 days a week. It\u2019s become a regular occurrence to have multiple instances of managers/clients asking why there is a child crying. Over the weekend, met my neighbour upstairs and she asked me if I too woke up early with a shock. (CONTEXT : Last Saturday the whole building woke up at 5:45 in the morning because the child was screaming and it went on for a good 20 minutes.)\n\nINFO: \n- The child is healthy. Regularly see the child in the play area and the street. \n- The mother is a stay at home mom. \n- There is no neglect. The child is well looked after. He looks about 3 years old and goes to a play school in the mornings. But hasn\u2019t been going this week. \n\nNow on to what happened today: \nI\u2019m working on something critical while handing off my responsibilities due to a transition and have back to back calls. Over the course of 4 hours I had to keep pausing my call. At one point, an important client (in another continent) asked me if I needed to be excused to take care of my child, I should reschedule the call. Another person on the call chimed in with the sentence \u201cwe should not be neglecting a child because our call is running long\u201d. Apologised to them and informed them that that was my neighbours child. They mentioned how it sounds like it\u2019s happening in my house. \n\nAfter the call ended I went out to the balcony and in a very respectful way asked the mother if the child was unwell? She didn\u2019t like it and asked why. I asked her again if the baby is unwell, she said no. She mentioned she took away something that he was trying to eat and that\u2019s why he was crying. Explained to her what happened on my calls and she snapped with \u201cHe\u2019s a baby, what do you expect?\u201d \n\nI asked her if I didn\u2019t talk to the child\u2019s mother who else do I speak to? Explained to her that I completely understand the challenges of being a mother and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s overwhelming. But it happens so many times a day and is not letting me focus. She started crying. \n\nWas AITA\n\n(He\u2019s loudly crying as I type this. Took a voice recording but don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way for me to attach it). \n\nPlease advice. I\u2019m ready to be judged. If I was in the wrong, I will go over tomorrow and apologise.\n\nEDIT: \n- A lot of folks are asking me to go to the office. Most tech companies have globally changed their policies to 100% remote work or some combination of hybrid work. So going to the office apart from my designated 2 days is not an option. \n- Saw a few folks asking me to move. We have a lease till May 2024.

I really suggest buying a decent headset which will reduce background noise and checking your Teams settings. I\u2019m in a flat and had builders hammering directly on my wall. It was a nightmare for me to concentrate through but no one on my call heard a peep. That was with a decent Jabra wireless set - maybe worth \u00a375.\n\nAlso, make sure you mute yourself unless you\u2019re actually speaking", "I'm gonna lean to NAH, but this isn't something you need to be involving yourself with.  Tell the landlord, it's up to them to enforce solutions to noise problems.   And, that way it's documented, and if other people complain, it can be dealt with more directly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, having said that, it ISN'T that normal.  Kids are loud, and yeah, they scream sometimes, but not constantly...unless something's wrong. And that reaction says Mom KNOWS it is a problem,  but doesn't know what to do.  If she had it under control, she'd be apologetic.", "At what point do you complain about your management charging you to.live in an inadequately insulated place?\n\nPeople are mad at their neighbors all the time for noise, but the way apartments are built now is incredibly shoddy and unfair to tenants. And the landlords are the ones who can change that.", "NAH\n\nWhen you have a toddler, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. If you give in to a temper tantrum, you're told you're creating a spoiled brat; if you don't give into a temper tantrum, most toddlers have the energy and grumpiness to tantrum loudly for HOURS on end.", "NAH.\nThe mum has a difficult child. I had one of those, and was often at my wits end.\nThe only way to keep the noise down is to do exactly what the toddler wants, all the time. And end up with a spoiled, entitled brat. \n\nOur new neighbour was about to report us for child abuse... Then my husband, toddler and neighbour were chatting while hubby was hosing the garden. Lovely. Until toddler wanted the hose. Didn't want to spray the neighbour, so the kid was offered that he could hold the hose WITH dad. \n\nSplit second change from happy to screaming banshee. \n\nNeighbour just stared- his jaw dropped. \"Is THAT all it takes? You just said no.\"\nYep. That's all it took to trigger a massive meltdown.\n\nProbably took another 7years for him to learn about battles and wars, and get himself under control. Much psychology, and battles with school teachers along the way", "NTA, I love how everyone is complaining about you not having proper noise canceling headphones, but no-one mentions the very early morning wake-up scream that even woke the upstairs neighbour..... You're entitled to a reasonable amount of peace in your own home but this sounds excessive to what another person is expected to bear. We can't abdicate the responsibility of bringing up our children to other people and living within your own space physically and environmentally, you can't expect someone else just to suck it up and tolerate it.  Wether or not this child has  a physical or mental issue really is not your problem (which a lot of people feel is harsh, but true), noise whatever it's cause can be tortuous and anxiety inducing for other people. A child's screaming in fact messes with our programming even more because biologically we react more to it, especially women.\nBut it really is building management's issue.  When it comes to these things it's better to not stand alone.", "NAH but what software are you using to make your video calls? We use Teams and there are different settings to block out background noise.\n\nWe've been having our house rewired whilst I've been working from home and nobody has noticed any of the horrendous noise. Most similar software has this capability, you just need to find the right settings.", "NTA\n\nContact building management/landlord.  Ask if they can install soundproofing in the apartment of the unhappy toddler.  Tell them why and let them take care of it.\n\nAsk the other tenants if they're willing to contact management/the landlord as well.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA\n\nBut a 2/3 year old constantly screaming, there has to be something wrong.", "NAH - you have every right to be frustrated \nAnd also some kids are like this for a while- they may have developmental issues or something but even if that\u2019s true there\u2019s no magic cure. The mom is in her home with her child, she\u2019s doing her best, she likely hates the crying just as much as everyone else.", "NAH. I get that you're annoyed and distracted, I would be too.\n\nIt must be even worse for the mom though, listening to that all day, trying to stop or quiet it, and now she's embarrassed it's also bothering the neighbors.", "NAH because I understand it\u2019s irritating as hell to be listening to that. Thing is, I doubt very much that she isn\u2019t trying to stop it. Some kids are screamers at that age. And you have no actual ability to assess the health of the child. My youngest was very much this way (after having two kids who were very quiet!). If we just walked past you on the street, you would see a pretty typical looking kid. But she actually had critical heart defects and is awaiting autism assessment. I probably wouldn\u2019t share this information with a neighbour who I felt was judging me when I\u2019m probably already constantly judging myself. And obviously with a kid that young, it could just as easily be a more loud version of normal development. \n\nThat woman is exhausted AF, trust me. Is there another parent around? Is she alone most of the time? Istg I almost went insane with my screamer when my husband was working out of town.", "You are NTA and neither is the mom. She\u2019s likely super stressed . Lots of toddlers cry and this one sounds like they cry louder and more than usual. It\u2019s not her fault , can\u2019t make the toddler stop crying - I mean the more one try the louder and longer it gets.\n\nThe apartment is the asshole here. Cheaply made apartments with no thought to being real homes, just income producing boxes. I have lived in apartments all my life next to families etc and never had to contend with crying noises that loud due to good building codes.", "I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s a undiagnosed autistic. The tantrums and screaming could be just that. Or not. Either way it sucks for OP", "NAH. You need headphones with a mic. You also need to mute yourself unless you are talking. I live near an airfield and wear heaphones when working from home just for my peace of mind. On the handful of calls I've been on, if the other people leave their mikes live, the static from them makes me nuts. \n\nThe child is being a child. Eventually they will grow out of it. But it is impacting your work and your solution was not to limit your exposure (headphones) and go straight to the mother, who is very aware her kid is crying all the time, to ask her to get him to stop. Trust me, if she could, she would. \n\nHang some tapestries to help with noise control between the flats, close your window when working. I would probably still contact your landlord because one child crying should be heard building wide. They need better insulation between units at minimum.", "2-year-olds are assholes, so it doesn't really matter if you are or not. Although your neighbor probably thinks you're an ass now.", "Unfortunately this sounds to me like a *potential* autism meltdown. All three (3) of my friends kids have an autism diagnosis and the meltdowns get *BAAAAAAAAAAAAD*.\n\nInvest in noise cancelling headphones that have a microphone so you can work. Suggest to the husband (in a roundabout manner \u201cyour child reminds me of my autistic niece/nephew\u201d) about looking in to a formal diagnosis.", "Do you have noise cancellation turned on for your microphone? My vacuum can turn on right beside my desk and no one can hear it, same when my colleague\u2019s dog barks. If you don\u2019t have noise cancellation by default, get noise cancelling head phones. You can\u2019t control your neighbour and certainly not a 3 year old, but you do have some options within your control.", "Info - what magic powers do you think this child\u2019s mom has to make their 2 year old stop crying.  Toddlers are NOT little adults.  One cannot go up to a toddler and politely ask them to stop crying.", "NAH - this is a difficult situation for everyone involved.", "NTA for asking.. but I don't know what magic wand you expect the mother to wield to get a child to stop crying.. if she has one, I'd love to borrow it.", "Definitely not the asshole.  You were just asking. Get the headset the other commenters have suggested, but consider saying something nice to the mom. Toddlers suck, she sounds overwhelmed, and it's never a bad thing to soothe hurt feelings with the next-door neighbors", "It\u2019s a big expense but when the world went to WFH, my friend was unable to afford a larger house so he ordered one of those sound proof booths from China. LOVES it.", "Nta. But maybe add sound blocking. Idk. I\u2019m a mom of two and live in the country and still am worried about how loud my kids are. I feel for you. Kids are the assholes. \ud83d\ude06", "NAH but get noise dampening foam to adherer to your walls, if you know where music studio supply stores are you can check there. \n\nUnfortunately apartment living just isn't a good environment for constant screaming because the walls are too thin for it to not affect those around. That being said, if the kid is screaming for 20 minutes straight in some instances that maybe something that needs the parents to look at and make sure the kid is ok. \n\nThat being said, if the child is waking up the entire building at 5:45 am and won't stop for 20 minutes they may already be on the way to being asked to leave because more and more places are not allowing tenants who have continuous noise problems stay because it's unfair to everyone else in the building.", "I would have said N A H but honestly YTA based on the comment that you use your laptop audio and no headset. How have you not considered this yet? Of course they can hear everything, I\u2019m sure the quality of all your calls suck.", "since when has hybrid working been that the number of days in the office is a maximum?\n\nMy brother is in recruitment and I've just mentioned this and he, as I do, have never seen it as a maximum, but a minimum number of days in the office.\n\nYou work from home it's your job to work in a suitable environment.  Get yourself some soundproofing and a decent headset. It'll do wonders.  Soundproofing can be as simple as a lot of towels attached to a wooden frame", "1. Why are the walls so paper thin? Or HOW ARE HIS LUNGS THAT DEVELOPED TO WAKE AN ENTIRE BUILDING?!?!\n\n2. This hasnt been reported to the leasing office?!?!\n\n3. There\u2019s absolutely no room u can go in without hearing him?!?! Shutting a door doesnt help? \n\nIdk\u2026 seems like you stay in a really really shabby apartment with paper thin walls - windows open and a toddler with lungs of steal that ur calls can hear him crystal clear even shut off in rooms\n\nNTA. Heres hoping ur living situation gets better / u soundproof ur own housing / she can quiet him down", "Sorry man, this is just a part of living in an apartment building. Sometimes you pull the shortest straw and end up next to a family with children.", "Wait, you're just using an internal computer mic? Not a headset mic? How is that not the first thing you do?", "NTA. Start complaining to your building management.", "NAH. You're not wrong for wanting a quieter environment during your work days. She's not wrong for having a difficult toddler. Some kids just need to cry. \n\nAlthough, the amount of melt downs the child is having is making me wonder if there is a developmental disorder going on here. Just because the child appears healthy doesn't mean that they are not without some sort of disorder. Autism can be overlooked, especially in toddlers. The mom seems overwhelmed. \n\nIf you are interested, you could try talking to her again. Hear her side and maybe you two can find some sort of compromise that will help you with work.", "Landlord here.  You have the right to expect a reasonable amount of noise not to be exceeded by your neighbors.  You need to notify building management of the problem via email or certified mail using this exact wording: \n\n\"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am being denied the use and enjoyment of my apartment due to excessive noise above and beyond what could be reasonably expected from apartment #X.  For example on DD/MM/YY at 5:45am the entire building was awoken by screaming and crying from apartment #X.  These continuing outbursts are preventing me from being able to perform my job, relax in the apartment, and properly sleep.  I have attempted to discuss this issue with the female resident of apartment #X who has refused to take any action to resolve the issue.  I expect building management to resolve this issue which affects all of the tenants in the building.  \n\nRegards,\n\nu/Hotlemonicedtea\r\"", "NTA, while a crying child might be unavoidable, if it's impacting your ability to operate in your home - she might be able to at least temporarily move to another room to help muffle the sound. There was certainly no harm in asking.", "NAH. You handled it exactly how you should have. You expressed sympathy without judgement, you gave your concern. The mom must be having such a hard time, I would think that maybe the child is on the autism spectrum which is near impossible to control tantrum-wise and for a first time parent especially is hard to deal with.\n\nWhen you say she just suddenly burst out crying, I believe it. Now, this is a bit extra, but if you wanted to send over a little gift basket for mom with maybe a card telling her she\u2019s doing the best she can, that would probably make her entire day. You totally don\u2019t have to, just an idea. I hope she considers hiring some extra help or consider therapy.\n\nIm so sorry this is interrupting your work. I hope you guys figure out something.", "Could it be the child has autism and has meltdowns?", "NAH. You were trying to understand the situation as a starting point, which is reasonable - is this temporary? Is it a particular situation you could think of a suggestion to help? etc. Unless you actually told her to stop the kid from crying (which she obviously can't do and would if she could regardless of what you wanted), I don't think you overstepped by asking and identifying your issues. I don't think mom's reaction was out of line either though - she is way closer to the screaming than you are and similarly way more stressed out. If you can find a way, be as kind as you can with her. If it's true that something you do without thinking wakes the kid up, you definitely want her to tell you that so you can stop, right? And if you find out about a great parent's group at a nearby park, you want to be able to pass that on without it sounding pushy and judgemental.\n\nThat said, I can't believe you let this escalate at all while you are using your laptop mic! A $10 pair of earbuds with a mic will solve a lot of this and noise canceling technology may solve it entirely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That needs to be done, and it can't be easy on her either.  I had a child who did this at first trying to get his way, and it took a while for him to realize it wasn't going to get him what he wanted and to stop doing it.

Alot. I'm sure she doesn't want to have the baby crying anymore than you do. A little bit of compassion goes a long way.", "YTA if you\u2019re going to make a mother control her toddler why aren\u2019t YOU doing the basics of getting headsets for work calls?", "YTA....if only it were that easy to control a child hahahahahahahahahahahaha", "NAH- I get it. I get both sides. There is NO good way to get a toddler to stop throwing a tantrum. Really. It\u2019s what they do. A mother/father/parent can\u2019t force a child to be quiet without bad things. So that\u2019s not doable. \n\nBut I also get how frustrating it just be for you. I\u2019m impressed your colleagues are aware and not being a jerk about \u201cchild shouldn\u2019t be neglected because we ran long\u201d. That\u2019s pretty awesome. \n\nMute yourself when in meetings. Explain that the neighbors child is \u201chaving a moment\u201d when you unmute. Give mom some grace.

I'm sure she's not thrilled her child is being noisy. But what do you expect your neighbor has a small child. I have four kids I'm constantly on them telling them to keep it down.

First, if there\u2019s too much noise for you to wfh then that\u2019s your responsibility to fix. Noise cancelling headphones, directional microphone, library study room, temporary office space, there are lots of options. You can\u2019t really control what your neighbors, especially toddlers, do in their own living space in the middle of the day. \n\nSecond, I\u2019m sure you thought you were being nice and non judgmental when you talked to the mom, but you were not. I\u2019ve definitely heard and experienced people saying way worse, but it doesn\u2019t make what you said okay. You very clearly implied something was wrong and then put the onus on the mother to \u201cfix\u201d the situation so you could focus. Your wfh and focus issues are not anywhere on her priority list and trying to put it there is unkind. \n\nThird, you say you understand the challenges of being a mother but I don\u2019t think you do. And honestly, I think most parents would agree that unless you\u2019ve actually been in the trenches it\u2019s really hard to actually understand. Whatever frustration or stress you are feeling I can promise you the mother feels it 1000x more. She\u2019s probably a bit sleep deprived, she is right next to the meltdown, and she feels all the pressure of a parent and trying to manage it. She probably already feels somewhat like a failure because she can\u2019t get her kid to calm down, and then you come along to dump additional social pressure on her to make her feel even worse. \n\nYou\u2019re lucky that all she did was cry. I\u2019ve got three kids, two of whom are neurodivergent. It\u2019s hard. But my wife and I learned very quickly not to put up with anyone that came at us about our kids, especially people pretending to be nice or \u201cconcerned\u201d. If you had said what you said to me I would have calmly but firmly shamed with you and maybe thrown in a couple choice cuss words. My wife, who has a knack for sarcasm and just knowing peoples insecurities, would have made you cry.", "So number 1) YTA because you have openly admitted that you use you laptop microphone with no headset so you are literally making no effort to reduce the noise that the people on your call are going to hear and number 2) from what you have described it sounds like that child is very likely autistic or neurodivergent in some capacity and the mother is aware of the situation and is doing her best which is evident by the fact that your comments literally reduced her to tears which brings me to my third comment of yes YTA if what you are saying is bringing someone to tears, you say you were respectful but the fact that you reduced this poor woman to tears makes me think that you were in fact, not.

Did you think to ask if SHE was ok? I mean the kid's crying is driving you mad, but what about his mom? I think it wasn't necessarily bad to ask if the kid was doing ok, asking if it was unwell twice and not bothering to check on her is kind of messed up. \nYou have the option to find a different workspace at a coffee shop, library, or a rentable collaborative workspace, she doesn't. It's selfish of you to assume that he's messing up your workflow when in reality him and his mom are doing the best they can.

He will get older and hopefully learn to regulate better and may have some invisible condition / there might be something going on with the family's personal life. I would recommend taking measures to soundproof your house. There are sound dampening blankets you can hang over the door frame and you could run white noise. Really frustrating and sorry you're going through it.", "Cheap apartments suck. I once had my upstairs neighbors and downstairs neighbors show up to complain about my TV.

It sucks so much and I daydream about moving daily. \n\nIt's one thing to ask a neighbor to quiet down with music/tv/loud walking/loud noises while playing/etc. but no one wants to listen to a tantrum, not the parents either.

She could do with some support on how to parent with whatever the child\u2019s needs are, even if it is just frustration. The child might not be talking much and is very frustrated - therefore eliminate the communication barrier and use signs or PECS. It\u2019s at a point where many people in the flats are struggling due to this family, something needs to change", "Its like trying to negotiate with a very drunk emotional person. Who's upset because they don't have socks on. When they're the one who removed the sock.", "This sounds like my brother. He was non verbal until 3 1/3 and barely verbal until 6ish. He has more than just ASD but he would legit tantrum for hours because he didn't want to put on certain pants or doesn't like the sound something makes (never mind the excruciating sounds he made that everyone else had to listen to). Best way to distract him was letting him sort recycle or take the garbage out. (this sounds great but he usually just makes a mess and then get hyper-fixated on something else and doesn't clean it up and will not let anyone touch the properly sorted bottles)", "Same. The amount of time I spent with headphones on and the volume cranked up just so I wouldn\u2019t be tempted to throw myself off a bridge\u2026", "My son didn\u2019t get diagnosed with adhd until 7 and autism until 10 and it was a FIGHT to get those diagnoses. It was frustrating because we knew he had major issues (every teacher and child care professional who dealt with him told us there was something wrong and we needed to get him tested) and couldn\u2019t get access to any resources without a formal diagnosis. Kaiser was a goddamn nightmare to navigate.", "Trying to have my daughter diagnosed with adhd. \n\nFamily history of females with adhd. All older male relatives adhd.\n\nNope. \"We WONT diagnose a girl until she is 12.\"\n\nWTF \n\nIn the meantime we have sensory tantrums and learning issues constantly.\n\nSensory and mental overload tantrums 5 or more times a day. And the doctors are still. Nope she will grow out of it.", "Thisthisthis. It\u2019s so unfortunate how many times i see moms being shit on \u2018for not doing anything\u2019, when so often they\u2019re being told by medical professionals nothing can be done. I\u2019ve seen it firsthand and it\u2019s so devastating and isolating.", "I have the Sony XM5s, and they're great. I imagine Jabra are better for office/work (as I think they're specifically designed for that), but I like using mine as my actual headphones as well. I've also found some meeting programs are better for dealing with background noise than others - Zoom has less problem with background noise than Teams, in my experience.", "I was on voice in Discord with a friend and heard her just angry typing, which is her actual typing style lol. I asked her if she was using Mjolnir  to type. It\u2019s now an inside joke lol", "I have the Jabra GN. They're a little lower profile (heavier ones are a sensory nightmare for me) and don't block much noise on my end but the folks on the other end can't hear anything except my voice.", "he's always shelling out suggestions for me :) I'm happy we could help if at all :)", "I agree. How can OP be so oblivious of behaviour of a fellow human being (toddler)? When we adults can\u2019t regulate our emotions a lot of times, how can these little babies do? It\u2019s like becoming a trend ,hating the babies and their parents. Babies aren\u2019t robots who have a turn on and off switch . I am sure no parents like to\nSee their babies cry and do their best to keep them calm but I guess ! Today\u2019s world isn\u2019t made for babies. There is so much hostility against them.", "\u2764\ufe0f Thanks. It was actually a really simple fix but it took nearly a year to get a diagnosis. She did nothing but cry & puke.\ud83d\ude02 Longest year ever.\ud83d\ude02", "Not to mention it's EMBARASSING to take your kid our when they're having a tantrum because no matter what you're doing, people are judging you for your kid screaming.", "You're doing a great job. I could've written this myself. It's hard. But you're doing it!", "Thank you for saying this. I was once in this situation too and tbh it was hard to not hurt myself or worse. It feels utterly hopeless and alone.", "12 is very late. My daughter was diagnosed at 10 and that's because we waited for a year for an appointment.", "Oooh I need this too. My current headset does not block out noise. Last week my dog started barking and set off my coworker's dogs. Luckily we're pretty dog friendly in zoom but lord that was annoying", "Seriously, I learned on a manual and then an electric typewriter back in the 1980s. From my manual days I learned to hit the keys hard. It sometimes sounds like I\u2019m murdering my keyboard!", "Ha ha. I was told by an office workstation ergonomics assessor that I should try to \u201cTinkle\u201c the keys. I find this impossible because I did learn to type on a huge, cast-iron mechanical typewriter where you had to punch the keys.", "I literally have to plan our outings in order to make sure my 6yo autistic kiddo doesn't get overstimulated & has a meltdown. We don't stay long at family get togethers, & we do cheap or free family activities so as not to waste money because he'll try to elope for the exit after an hour or so if it's too loud or crowded. \n\nLast Thanksgiving, my sister got him his favorite foods & set up a quiet corner just for him with toys & coloring books that he could go hang out at if things got too much. It meant the world to me that she included him in everything, because up to that point, everyone else just judged him or nitpicked how we care for him (thinking we coddle him when we're just doing our best to accommodate his limits).", "My child would run into traffic or in the path of semi trucks. She was fascinated with big trucks. It was extremely unsafe. She would slip away from me and hide inside stores or play areas, try to run away from parks or playgrounds and it was terrifying. I had no help. I used a backpack with a leash but she could still manage to get away and run.\n\nYou never know what someone is going through.", "100%\n\nMothers carry around so much shame already we don\u2019t want to add more just for fun.", "Thank you so much.\n\nI took him to the post office and the pet shop yesterday which seems like nothing to some but I was proud.\n\nHe tried to put his hands in every single fish bowl so we probably won\u2019t go there again together for a bit but we made it home safely haha.", "I hope you are doing better.\n\nSo many of us suffer in silence, feeling like we are alone in our thoughts and experiences.

You guys are doing great.", "as an Autistic adult who was so often the overstimulated and picky kid who always felt excluded at family events, I am so glad to hear that you are supporting your kid\u2019s needs and that your sister took those needs into account and helped to make your kiddo more comfortable. thank you for validating your kid\u2019s experiences and accommodating his limits instead of just telling him to get over it. growing up with that support is going to make such a huge different in his life :)", "I remember that phase. lol  Now they're 14 and 17 and I'm just like \"for the love of glob please take a shower.\"", "Aww, you disturbed their beauty sleep lol.
