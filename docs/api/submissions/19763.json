You could have waited a bit to request breakfast, but also I would think it was weird and awkward if you stood there and waited or even if you kept coming in to see if they were done with conversation. They could have also stopped the conversation and acknowledged that you had walked into the room. I think people think you\u2019re coming off as entitled because they\u2019re not used to the fact that it\u2019s normal for low-high wage workers to have a maid in some parts of the world. It doesn\u2019t help that you\u2019re coming off as \u201crude\u201d because English isn\u2019t your first language and you have to translate what was being said.

It's her job to make your breakfast but there were more tactful ways to ask. It also doesn't sound like you waited more than a few seconds.

Rude for interrupting someone's conversation because you feel your needs are more important than politely waiting", "YTA\n\nIf you're privileged enough to have someone you pay to cook breakfast for you then odds are that you're not actually \"starving\" . . . you're just a bit hungry. You weren't going to have to wait hours for your meal, you were going to have to wait a few minutes for them to finish their conversation.\n\nYour girlfriend was right, interrupting people who are having a conversation, unless it is a genuine emergency, is rude. Always. It's something that we teach small children, because even nursery children can understand that. Nothing terrible was going to happen to you if you had to wait 3-5 minutes for her to start making your breakfast. You were just going to be hungry for a few minutes. And the fact that you thought that your hunger was SO IMPORTANT that you had to interrupt two other adults to demand that she start cooking speaks quite loudly to your arrogance and self-centredness, and that you assume that you are far more important than your girlfriend in this household. You may want to think about that going forward. It's not a good look for an adult, and I doubt if this is the only context in which you behave this way.", "You pay this person for this service, it's their literal job. You mentioned in comments that you *did* interrupt politely, you may want to add that to your post (where you said excuse me, etc.) \n\nThey could have taken one moment to pause their convo when they saw you waiting to speak. It's unreal, imo, to think you should wait an indefinite amount of time, when they could have just paused for one moment. \n\nI see people are saying you should have made your own breakfast, or just skipped it. Why are you paying her if you have to do it yourself, tho? Isn't this at least *part* of why she was hired? \n\nIt wouldn't hurt to self reflect & see if maybe you spoke rushed, or in a rude manor when interrupting them, and apologize if you did.

Could've at least said that you were sorry to interrupt, but the better thing to do would've been to just wait. Or to feed yourself if you were that hungry that you couldn't wait.", "YTA.

Wow the privilege and entitlement here is unreal.", "YTA - don\u2019t be rude.  You were speaking to a person who was having a conversation with your partner.  You are not the center of the world.

Grow up.", "YTA you could've waited a bit or at the very least apologised for interrupting the conversation.", "YTA. Don\u2019t you have hands?
