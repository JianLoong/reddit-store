I\u2019m Chinese and she\u2019s Russian, but we've been living in Australia for a while now. Both of us live in the same uni dorm. She has this thing where when she requests for something from me she does not just ask for it, e.g. instead of asking \"hey can I pls have this\" she goes \"give me this/that\" in a very demanding tone and it makes me uncomfortable. In the past I've pointed it out to her that it's coming across as rude and asked her to ask politely, she listened.\r\n\r\nToday we were hanging in my room. I was studying when she came up to me and said \"Give me your laptop I need to pay my rent\" in a short and direct manner without smiling. It did not sound friendly at all. I told her that sounded so demanding and it's coming across as rude, and asked her if she could use phrases like \"Could you please....?\". She got mad at me and said I'm picking on her English. I told her I'm not, but just asking her to ask in another way since she is coming across as rude. She then said it's only a problem that existed in the English language and it shouldn't matter. She got really mad. In the end she left my room and went back to hers. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, I was just simply communicating with her about what's making me uncomfortable and made a simple request for her to ask questions instead of demanding things from me. Even when I ask her for things, I go with \"hey, may I pls.....?\". I was a bit surprised when she got mad at me. As for the \u201cproblem that only existed in English\u201d part, my stand is that different languages have different ways of expressing emotions and tones and since we\u2019re speaking in English, we should follow the ways the English language express politeness and friendliness and avoid sounding rude. \r\n\r\nShe's been pushing me to make her my gf but I've been hesitant and her demanding things from me is one of the reasons why.

Is it realistic for her to learn this and implement it to your satisfaction?\n\nI ask because I find it so hard to make a ruling.  I\u2019m from Canada and I find a lot of cultures come across as rude (even some neighbouring provinces cough Quebec) but I know the intention is not to be rude. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to vocalize how you feel and gauge how much she\u2019s willing or able to adapt to that, but I think if you\u2019re at the point where you\u2019re insisting someone else to speak differently from you, especially in a second language, who is from a culture that is known for brusqueness, and they\u2019re taking it as an attack on how they speak, I think you may just be at an impasse. \n\nWhether you or she is TAH depends more on intentions and the minutia of your communications to each other.", "It sounds like a cultural thing.

You correctly questioned if this was an issue of *perceived* rudeness due to linguistic differences, and instead of even considering your feelings, she blew you off. At that point it\u2019s not a possible misperception, it\u2019s definite rudeness. \n\nAs other people have pointed out, sometimes cultural differences DO alter our perceptions of what it rude. For example, I dated an Indian man for a bit and he noticed that I always say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d when requesting something. According to him, in his specific region (could be more widespread, but it\u2019s a huge country so I take any blanket statements he made as applying directly to the region he was from and not necessarily as applicable to the entire country and every ethnicity therein) of India, it\u2019s rude to thank someone casually. My understanding from his explanation is that the expression of gratitude in the form of a verbal \u201cthank you\u201d is more politely reserved for big favors, and that using it casually sort of \u201ccheapens\u201d the sentiment. Just because they have the same words in their language doesn\u2019t mean they use it the same way.\n\nSimilarly, when I have non-American friends over to my apartment I\u2019m sometimes initially taken aback by their behavior because certain things that are considered rude in my \u201cculture\u201d (US is of course also a huge country and even amongst ourselves we have very different ideas sometimes on etiquette- see this sub for several examples lol) are perfectly normal in theirs and vice versa. One of my friends always says \u201chey give me X\u201d when he\u2019s at my house instead of *asking* \u201ccan I have X?\u201d. I consider that impolite, but since his tone isn\u2019t demanding I\u2019m not super offended by it. Friends of ours from his country and mine consider it rude, and other friends of ours from both countries say it\u2019s normal.

So clearly he wis chatting shite then \ud83e\udd2d Learn something new every day!", "I apologize. I cannot understand your sentences. The grammar and punctuation are inappropriate and incorrect. Can you learn English better and try again? That is expected, after all. You are on an English-speaking subreddit thread. /s", "What, you don't normally claim the nationality that your great grandfather was? :O\n\nBut for real, whenever an American has some proud heritage claim I can basically safely assume they've never even been there", "Personally I add please to all requests but it's still common not to do it. Maybe it's because you haven't lived in Russia for 24 years, but it sure is common to cut courtesy in close relationships.", "If majority of people do something, it's a norm. You can't just decide that most of people in country are all rude. It's different culture, that's how it is", "We usually say \"can you give me X\" or \"could you give me Y\", and say thanks/thank you either straight after the sentence or after someone does what we are asking. Even just \"give me X\" can sometimes be enough but just depends on the situation and person one is talking to (family/friends vs stranger).\n\nI struggled a bit with please when I first moved to an English speaking country but luckily my (work) friends reminded me about it in a nice way - and sometimes teasingly :D I learned to be better but still have to make an effort when writing emails etc. But the please comes more naturally now.", "Grammar is my worse subject and I try and learn to better communicate. If you want to try using that against me go for it, but it doesn\u2019t change that people being unwilling to learn is problematic not the person asking for better communication.", "You're american", "We seem to have lived in different Russias", "And you can't speak on behalf of all Russians :)", "Exactly", "No one said they are.  I am giving examples at different ends of the scale about overt politeness.", "The word polite is in the title of the post.  We are talking about being polite.", "His partner does have a problem with the language. He said so. Empty words for \"politeness\" are annoying, wasteful, and not typically problematic for Russian, Finnish, Danish, and other languages. Why is it polite to use expletives?", "Hey mate, a quick irrelevant question.\n\nIt says \"Say Happy Cake Day\" when you comment.  It does on mine too.  Do you know why please?\n\nThanks :)", "No, because it's inappropriate to teach adult manners even if you think they don't meet your standards. You're supposed to ignore it and stop talking to them.", "Well I live in one and you said you left it 24 years ago. That could be a key.", "Where does he say that cause I don\u2019t see him say she has an issue with speaking or understanding English? As for why it\u2019s polite to use expletives it is because for English they are meant to give off a certain intent or tone. Her refusing to learn cause of the way requests are made in Russian is problematic if she is going to live in English culture, because she will unintentionally cause misunderstandings with others and potential partners", "They definitely are. Language is a prime indicator of a culture's ethos, and they've honed each other for centuries.\n\nYour culture appears to be much less worried with respect for the individual and their stuff/privacy, and blurrs personal boundaries whenever the other is considered \"one of my circle\".\n\nWhat's interesting is that OP is also from a less individualistic culture, yet he took offense to her blunt manner.", "I never said that :)", "\"picking on her English\" and \"a problem only in English\" are direct quotes from her according to OP. She feels like her partner is picking on her for a linguistic and cultural difference she is struggling with, SO HE IS. This isn't coworkers, this isn't a professional setting or even a social one. They have loved together for a while. Do you want your day-in-and-out partner to constantly mention your grammar mistakes?", "That's what I mean. Languages often sound like something, but doesn't mean they are. Germans in fact aren't all angry and Spanish in fact aren't always yell at people.", "This. Very much. I had a Russian teacher who said she hates English because it uses too many words to say things. She was hilarious. And an English teacher .", "That's an interesting perspective. I didn't think about it like this. Yes, I think I'd agree, it's common to divide to \"my circle\" and not, and boundary is super blended up to non existent with your circle.\n\nSmall anecdote: my German fiance offended me to guts when he said he was slightly grossed because I use his towels hanging in the bathroom. I was using whatever was dry, he thought we need separate ones because it's an individual item. I was also shocked because we already share all possible germs we have on our faces and hands and him saying we need separate hand towels was slap in the face. (Of course we handled it) I'm exaggerating a bit, in reality we laughed at how dumb this contradiction is", "As German language learner: that's a good one \ud83d\ude02"]}
