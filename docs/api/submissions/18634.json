I\u2019m Chinese and she\u2019s Russian, but we've been living in Australia for a while now. Both of us live in the same uni dorm. She has this thing where when she requests for something from me she does not just ask for it, e.g. instead of asking \"hey can I pls have this\" she goes \"give me this/that\" in a very demanding tone and it makes me uncomfortable. In the past I've pointed it out to her that it's coming across as rude and asked her to ask politely, she listened.\r\n\r\nToday we were hanging in my room. I was studying when she came up to me and said \"Give me your laptop I need to pay my rent\" in a short and direct manner without smiling. It did not sound friendly at all. I told her that sounded so demanding and it's coming across as rude, and asked her if she could use phrases like \"Could you please....?\". She got mad at me and said I'm picking on her English. I told her I'm not, but just asking her to ask in another way since she is coming across as rude. She then said it's only a problem that existed in the English language and it shouldn't matter. She got really mad. In the end she left my room and went back to hers. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, I was just simply communicating with her about what's making me uncomfortable and made a simple request for her to ask questions instead of demanding things from me. Even when I ask her for things, I go with \"hey, may I pls.....?\". I was a bit surprised when she got mad at me. As for the \u201cproblem that only existed in English\u201d part, my stand is that different languages have different ways of expressing emotions and tones and since we\u2019re speaking in English, we should follow the ways the English language express politeness and friendliness and avoid sounding rude. \r\n\r\nShe's been pushing me to make her my gf but I've been hesitant and her demanding things from me is one of the reasons why. I talked to her multiple times about her way of requesting things but she still didn't listen.\r\n\r\nAITA for asking the woman I've been seeing to politely ask for things from me instead of demanding it from me?\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Woman I have been seeing for over half a year has been demanding things from me instead of asking.  Today she did it again. I asked her to ask in a more polite way and she got mad at me.

I hope so she can use online bill pay, not to sell it to make some money.\n\nRegardless and about the cultural thing, most Russians I know absolutely know how to be polite, even if it may be a more direct culture than others.

Better run away.", "NTA\n\nCourtesy is a free and widely available commodity so should be liberally used.  \n\nIt's one thing to learn the technical elements of the English language but also important to learn how to use it in a polite way.  It doesn't mean she has to fall over herself to be the politest person on the planet but at the very least make an effort.\n\nWhen ever I visit a different country the first thing I make sure I can do is say things like please and thank you in the local language.  Its remarkable how much small things like this are appreciated by people.", "While it is true that tones sound different in different languages, all languages have questions. Pretty sure Russian has a form of \u201cplease.\u201d I know some Russians and while they are more direct than what I am, they are polite.

NTA but I am not sure you two are compatible.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA although i do know Russian American English can be very direct and to the point like that so it could 100% be seen as you making fun of her English. \n\nThough that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you have asked her to ask for thing instead of demanding them multiple times. But someone asking you to change how you speak takes a lot of time so don\u2019t expect an overnight change just keep letting her know how you feel about the direct/demanding way of asking for things.", "NTA - Clearly courtesy is important to you in a relationship.    A lot of people I have known in the past don't subscribe to my level of courtesy expectations due to the culture they were raised in.    Talk to her.   Tell her you feel uncomfortable with her always demanding instead of asking and see what she says.   She may not be the right one for you but you'll never know until you have that conversation.  At least you know one trait you don't want in a relationship.", "You\u2019re not the asshole at all. Your request was totally reasonable. It\u2019s a red flag that she reacted how she did- I\u2019d be careful with this woman.", "NTA\nShe sounds horrible. I don\u2019t care what culture she\u2019s from, if she can\u2019t learn basic grammar politeness she\u2019s not worth it. If a woman in college can\u2019t figure out how to say please and thank you she\u2019s not someone you should be wasting time with no matter the \u201clanguage barrier\u201d.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t know Russians to be rude especially when they are your friends so I see this more as a personal preference and not a lost in translation thing", "INFO do you think she is actually being rude in her intentions, or that it\u2019s just coming across that way because she\u2019s so direct in how she speaks? \n\nIOW, are you asking her to perform politeness as you\u2019re accustomed to it, or are you asking her to BE more kind in her intentions?\n\nAlso, how good is her English? Is it realistic for her to learn this and implement it to your satisfaction?\n\nI ask because I find it so hard to make a ruling.  I\u2019m from Canada and I find a lot of cultures come across as rude (even some neighbouring provinces cough Quebec) but I know the intention is not to be rude. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to vocalize how you feel and gauge how much she\u2019s willing or able to adapt to that, but I think if you\u2019re at the point where you\u2019re insisting someone else to speak differently from you, especially in a second language, who is from a culture that is known for brusqueness, and they\u2019re taking it as an attack on how they speak, I think you may just be at an impasse. \n\nWhether you or she is TAH depends more on intentions and the minutia of your communications to each other.", "It sounds like a cultural thing.  I have known a number of Russians in my life, most are blunt and direct.\n\nI dated a Russian girl for just over a year, and she was much like you are describing.  She once said \"open the door\" when she had something in her hands.\n\nI told her she was rude and should say please.\n\nShe asked why.\n\nI didn't really have an answer.  There is no reason to say please other than we were taught it is polite to do so when we were younger.", "Omg just break up already you\u2019re in college!!", "NAH. She has a direct communication style that's in conflict with your more indirect and phatic-intensive one. It's something you'll have to work through, but it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker if you're both willing to do it.", "So, there's definitely cultural issues with how people phrase things. In my country we are almost overly polite, and we can see people from other countries as rude because they will say \"can you give me the phone\" whereas we would say \"hey, sorry, if you don't mind would you be able to pass me the phone, if it's not putting you out. But only if you can\".\n\nIf she's trying and slipping up then NAH, but if it's upsetting you and she's not making any effort to change then NTA. Unless you bring it up every single time, then you might slip into YTA.\n\nBut do you like this woman? From what you wrote it's hard to tell.", "NAH.\n\nHonestly, as someone who lived in China for years, before reading your post I thought \"I bet she's Chinese...\"\n\nBut nope. You say you are, and she's Russian.\n\nThat's just a linguistic cultural difference.\n\nIt can take years to unwind those intrinsic cultural habits. And it can feel like you're being told off when someone tries to correct you.", "This *is* a language thing.  She is being direct.  This is the way she speaks.  You sound patronizing af like you're talking to a toddler \"first you have to say please!\"  If you like her you should apologize for taking this cultural difference to a \"I'm right, you're wrong\" place.

In the west, it signals a conclusion of transaction, large or small, personal or material. You say thank you when the Starbucks barista passes you the grande strawberry syrup filled with sugar topped with a shot of espresso. But you also say thank you when your loved ones come home with a gift, or help you do the dishes after dinner. In China, these latter acts of kindness are entrenched in what is expected of you. You do nice things for your family because they\u2019re family, and saying thank you actually disintegrates this ancestral norm. If I said thank you to my grandma after she made breakfast for me, she\u2019d snap at me and say thanking her is unnecessary, we\u2019re all one family.

I've known several people from Russia who were *very* blunt, and a lot of people viewed them as rude, even though they really weren't, and the few people I've known from China were exceedingly polite. So there could possibly be a cultural clash there.\n\nHowever, as others have pointed out, blunt or not, \"please\" still exists in the Russian language and even if she wasn't trying to be rude, she shouldn't have gotten mad at you for expressing your feelings. \n\nWe're not even from different cultures, and my bf and I had to adjust to how we interacted with one another because we came from very different families who talked to each other very differently. Some things we'd say to each other would come off as different than we intended. However, we listened to each other when we expressed our feelings about these things, we didn't just get mad. And we both are now more careful not to say things we know would upset the other even if that's not what we intended.\n\nRegardless as to whether or not she's rude or just blunt, the way she talks to you doesn't feel good and you've expressed that to her. If she calms down and apologizes, good.
