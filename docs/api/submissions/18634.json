I\u2019m Chinese and she\u2019s Russian, but we've been living in Australia for a while now. Both of us live in the same uni dorm. She has this thing where when she requests for something from me she does not just ask for it, e.g. instead of asking \"hey can I pls have this\" she goes \"give me this/that\" in a very demanding tone and it makes me uncomfortable. In the past I've pointed it out to her that it's coming across as rude and asked her to ask politely, she listened.\r\n\r\nToday we were hanging in my room. I was studying when she came up to me and said \"Give me your laptop I need to pay my rent\" in a short and direct manner without smiling. It did not sound friendly at all. I told her that sounded so demanding and it's coming across as rude, and asked her if she could use phrases like \"Could you please....?\". She got mad at me and said I'm picking on her English. I told her I'm not, but just asking her to ask in another way since she is coming across as rude. She then said it's only a problem that existed in the English language and it shouldn't matter. She got really mad. In the end she left my room and went back to hers. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, I was just simply communicating with her about what's making me uncomfortable and made a simple request for her to ask questions instead of demanding things from me.

As for the \u201cproblem that only existed in English\u201d part, my stand is that different languages have different ways of expressing emotions and tones and since we\u2019re speaking in English, we should follow the ways the English language express politeness and friendliness and avoid sounding rude. \r\n\r\nShe's been pushing me to make her my gf but I've been hesitant and her demanding things from me is one of the reasons why.

Is it realistic for her to learn this and implement it to your satisfaction?\n\nI ask because I find it so hard to make a ruling.  I\u2019m from Canada and I find a lot of cultures come across as rude (even some neighbouring provinces cough Quebec) but I know the intention is not to be rude. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to vocalize how you feel and gauge how much she\u2019s willing or able to adapt to that, but I think if you\u2019re at the point where you\u2019re insisting someone else to speak differently from you, especially in a second language, who is from a culture that is known for brusqueness, and they\u2019re taking it as an attack on how they speak, I think you may just be at an impasse. \n\nWhether you or she is TAH depends more on intentions and the minutia of your communications to each other.", "It sounds like a cultural thing.

You correctly questioned if this was an issue of *perceived* rudeness due to linguistic differences, and instead of even considering your feelings, she blew you off. At that point it\u2019s not a possible misperception, it\u2019s definite rudeness. \n\nAs other people have pointed out, sometimes cultural differences DO alter our perceptions of what it rude. For example, I dated an Indian man for a bit and he noticed that I always say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d when requesting something. According to him, in his specific region (could be more widespread, but it\u2019s a huge country so I take any blanket statements he made as applying directly to the region he was from and not necessarily as applicable to the entire country and every ethnicity therein) of India, it\u2019s rude to thank someone casually. My understanding from his explanation is that the expression of gratitude in the form of a verbal \u201cthank you\u201d is more politely reserved for big favors, and that using it casually sort of \u201ccheapens\u201d the sentiment. Just because they have the same words in their language doesn\u2019t mean they use it the same way.\n\nSimilarly, when I have non-American friends over to my apartment I\u2019m sometimes initially taken aback by their behavior because certain things that are considered rude in my \u201cculture\u201d (US is of course also a huge country and even amongst ourselves we have very different ideas sometimes on etiquette- see this sub for several examples lol) are perfectly normal in theirs and vice versa. One of my friends always says \u201chey give me X\u201d when he\u2019s at my house instead of *asking* \u201ccan I have X?\u201d. I consider that impolite, but since his tone isn\u2019t demanding I\u2019m not super offended by it. Friends of ours from his country and mine consider it rude, and other friends of ours from both countries say it\u2019s normal.
