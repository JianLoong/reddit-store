I understand that it is awkward.  But you can do awkward things.  After the first time it gets easier.\n\nYou can get a bidet attachment from Amazon for the toilet that costs about $30.  That will handle most to the wiping issues.", "I'm going to possibly get slack for this, but NAH. Your mom is going through a lot of tough crap right now and she is frustrated you aren't comfortable helping your brother. But you are allowed to not want to have to help him after the bathroom.  Not to mention the amount if stuff that could go wrong with helping him go to the bathroom and wash up if you guys rush, don't pay attention etc. He can get sores from not being wiped correctly.  He could get injured if trying to get in and out of a tub. He could get infections by trying to hold his urine or bowel movements because how uncomfortable he is.", "Heard two broken arms and was worried we're getting a new edition of a reddit classic at first lol.\n\nNTA overall it's a weird position to be in.", "NAH", "Do you even know what it would cost to employ a home help/caretaker, or is this a half-baked suggestion where you don't understand the fees involved?", "NTA\n\nYou are not your mother's co-parent and you're not the A for offering to help her find a more suitable intensive care provider for your brother. There are likely other ways she can provide the level of care required for her son that will not be so intrusive to your relationship with him; she needs to figure her situation out.", "Soft YTA. I get the grossness, but he's your brother, and it's not like you mom is going on vacation. She needs you temporarily, so step up.\n\nYou don't want to touch is butt? There are devices (poles) out there for people with disabilities to self-wipe. You could use that to help him. You could also try peri bottles or bidets. Same for scrubbing him in the shower or tub. Get a brush with a handle.", "NAH\nMum is under extreme pressure amd not thinking about the discomfort of both of you.  It's incredibly unfair to ask anyone to carry out intimate care duties but right now she's incapable of thinking about that, it's just hwr stress talking. You do the legwork of finding somebody to help to take that stress away.", "NTA. You are still a teenager. It\u2019s not your responsibility to provide medical care for an injured sibling. He\u2019s your mother\u2019s child and he requires professional care right now and it\u2019s her responsibility to arrange it. I\u2019m sorry you even had to bring this up with her. If I were your brother, I\u2019d had wanted that from the beginning.", "YTA. Yes it is weird, yes it is gross, well you are learning that to really *care for* someone is often uncomfortable on both end. Life is full of shit and accidents and medical troubles, today it is your brother, tomorrow it could be your mother or your partner.  Or you. It is a human duty and beauty to care for the weakers of our group.\n\nI think that it is dehumanising way to consider your family, to not be able to care or to be cared for by their members (looking at your brother too) when in weakness or in sickness. And that in general people who are not able to look at and care for the sicks, the weaks and the elders are part of what's wrong in the world. \n\n(\"not able\" in the sense : disgusted, or not be able to face up those situation)\n\nAlso I see all those comment talking about a bidet and as it is natural in my culture I didn't consider that you should hand wipe his butt. Just get a portable bidet and  splash water. \n\nAnyway, putting aside the moral, It will be not only expensive but ridiculous to pay someone to come just for a shower and a tour to the toilets. And what if your brother want to pee or poo outside the work hour of the assistant ? You will have to figure it out anyway. It would be silly to pay a full time service, and for real annoying for everyone, even the caretaker.", "NTA and that\u2019s asking for a lot even your brother feels uncomfortable", "A very soft YTA. This is not please take care of  your permanently disabled sibling for life post.   This is a temporary horrible accident that your brother will soon be out of.  \n\nSuck it up and know you can hold this over his head in jokes at family dinners for decades to come.", "NTA. I think this is a reasonable and fair boundary for you and your brother to put down. Your mother is being cheap in this instance.", "NTA sorry I get that it would be expensive and she might be okay with it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be", "YTA, it is for a couple of weeks, not for months or years.   if I was your mother I would be disappointed in you and feel like when the chips are down I can\u2019t count on you to be there to help.  I would have to wonder what I did wrong in raising my adult son.", "NTA\n\nHe is 15, and is only her responsibility. She doesn't get to drop that responsibility onto you.", "Not throwing judgement, my suggestion is a bidet from target. They are cheap and very easy to install. \n\nNeither you *or* your brother want you wiping his ass, your mother is acting like it's just you. It needs to be made clear to her that he doesn't want that either. \n\nI've wiped my brother's ass, but he was a baby in diapers. If I had to be a caretaker for someone old enough to do it (whether or not they were able to), family or not, I'd expect to get *paid* like a caretaker, because that is way above expected chores.", "I work in surgery and no way would I wipe my any of my brother\u2019s asses", "NTA. Finding extra help is expensive, but at the same time you are not responsible for your brother. To quote the Bible: \u201cI am not my brother\u2019s keeper\u201d (Cain about Abel)\nIf your mother can\u2019t find a way to hire help, she should be taking your brother with her.", "Yta- a spray bottle, wet wipes and rubber gloves go a long way my dude. \n\nStop stressing your mother out.", "NTA - Tough spot for your mother considering your brother will live to tell about it her mother may not.  Take care of your brother... he wont forget this and some day you may need someone to take care of you the older sibling.  \n\nI would get the bidet though and some wipes or however the fk hes suppose to clean himself.", "NTA. Purchase a bidet from Amazon. This might make it easier for you all the manage his care", "NTA. Even more not the NTA since brother is uncomfortable too.", "NTA. Get a caregiver and someone to help your brother regardless of what your mother says. You are too young to be in this kind of role right now. You are not the parent, she is. Your brother is a teenager, and his wounds should hopefully heal, but he needs to have a responsible and more mature caregiver with experience in dealing with people who have physical disabilities.", "Eh I'm going with NTA. Simply based on the fact that neither your brother nor yourself are comfortable with the arrangement. It's okay to admin that. You are not the parent so if you aren't comfortable, then your mother will have to make other arrangements. If she can't afford to pay someone, then perhaps a relative that lives outside the home? Or a friend or relative that may be in the medical field. My mom is an RN and has helped out relatives more times than I can count over the years with random things.", "NTA.  You are not your brother's parent and he is not your responsibility!  I honestly don't know how your mother thinks it is even reasonable to expect you to take on this responsibility.  \n   \nWhy doesn't she take her son with her?  Sure it is a stressful situation, but if her mother is in hospice care, her mother is being cared for and she should be able to care for her son.", "NTA. Women will just never understand the masculine urge to not be responsible for wiping your own brother\u2019s ass.", "I don\u2019t know what country you\u2019re in but where I live our taxes pay for home support when someone is unable to care for themselves.\nGranted they don\u2019t provide around the clock care for someone to wipe themselves but are you really proposing that you hire someone to be on call for whenever your brother uses the toilet?\nThey would not give him a full bath or shower daily but instead just a sponge bath some days.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Listen to the suggestions of others and you will survive and be the better for it.", "NAH. It's understandable that neither you nor your brother want you to be wiping his ass.
