While empty his pee cup was NOT what I signed up for, I did it anyway, because he\u2019s my brother and wanted him to get well.

I'm wondering why she has to go now.  I know hospice means your grandma has 6 months or less to live (sorry about that) but leaving a minor child who can't use either arm is a pretty big deal.  Even if it's with his older brother.  So I'd first check that this is a true need and not just a knee jerk reaction to her being admitted into hospice.  \n\nNext has she spoken with the insurance company for your brother?  They have a lot of benefits people don't think of.  Like people who can come in and help part of the time.  Most often home health aides.  Keep in mind there's typically limitations and it won't be 24/7 care.  But it can help relieve the burden on you.  If you as a family do go ahead and hire help you can coordinate with anything available through the insurance to help keep cost down.  24/7 care is ridiculously expensive.  Avoid it if at all possible.", "NTA for not wanting to do certain things for him. Full time in home care is quite expensive, we were just paying almost $20,000/mo for my mom before moving her to a care home. Ask his doctor to request therapy/nursing to aid in his care that should be covered by insurance. It\u2019s not full time care, just drop ins but someone can come out and assist with bathing him, typically two or three times a week. Adding the bidet as previously suggested is a great idea.

Grandma is on hospice and unless you are going to pay for 100% of the care, you are burdening mom at a time when you should be trying to unburden mom. You have a dick, balls and an ass hole - so does your brother. Ya'll will bond over this and you can tell cringy stories about it later.

But your Mom is going to lose her mother. You two need to suck it up and deal.  It\u2019s for a short period of time and a temporary situation.  Also, some states will offer home care assistance.

Do that!!", "NTA\n\nPeople may choose to work in a caring role (occupation wise) but not everyone wants to.  Some are put into that position and don't have much choice ie they are a parent.  They may also be co-erced and feel like they have no choice.  There is also a very large difference to someone providing general care ie help with cooking and cleaning help with personal care ie bathing and wiping butts.  Much easier to do this for a baby/toddler if it's your sibling than it is an older child and a 15 year old is well and truly big enough to voice their opinion.  In this case the 15 year old is not even giving consent for his brother to provide this care so it actually comes down to assault if he says no.  He's allowing his mother to do it but not his brother.  This may come down to a safety issue if it gets too far down the track ie infection from poor hygiene but it's not at that point yet.\n\nAlso getting someone who doesn't want to care for another person, and especially when one of those isn't even giving consent can mean that very poor care is given and things aren't done so you are left in the same position as giving no care.\n\nWhat I would like to know is how long has he been in this cast for and how much longer will he be in this cast?  And what was broken?  Was it an elbow?  Is there a bend in his cast or is it straight out?  Depending on what was broken and how long ago it may be possible to replace the current cast with a new, cast that may be smaller or one that allows you more mobility to  attend to much of your own personal care.  You can also get waterproof fibrecast casts.  You can shower with these but I don't normally recommend it (you'd have trouble drying all the inside when the water gets in if it's cold or if you are sweaty) but it would allow you to wash your face and splash the cast a little if you did shower with plastic over it ie it's not going to turn to mush in places like a plaster cast might.  They are also a lot lighter.\n\nNow none of that may be possible but I'd be speaking to a physiotherapist as to what care aids are available to help your brother wipe his arse and help himself pull his underwear and pants back up... though he may be okay with a dress/skirt (in a manly fashion) so less to worry about.\n\nIs there another family member or friend that can help out?  This is for the bigger things like a shower.  Or could he stay with another family member or friend (if he's close to the parents or friends, he and they might be okay with some personal care)?\n\nHow long will your mom likely be gone?  This is hospice care and not palliative care.  People can be in hospice for a long time before passing or moving on to other care (or even recovering).\n\nDepending on why your grandmother is in hospice care, does your mother need to go right now or can she go after her injured and care requiring son has recovered enough to be able to wipe his own bum?  Your mother does have competing interests here - her mother and her son... but if he were my son I would stay and if he were my grandson, I'd expect my daughter to stay and care for him.  This is very different to if grandmother was going to die in the next few days and you need to go... but then I would think she would be taking all of you unless you don't have a relationship with your grandmother.", "You can hire a nurse's aid to do the bathing.

OPs opinion isn't really the issue here. It's the brother. He has explicitly stated he does not want OP to wipe his butt. If the brother was in a care facility and he said he didn't want a particular staff member to wipe him and that staff member ended up doing it anyway, there's a very good chance that the staff member in question would lose their job and end up in prison on charges of abuse. For all the shit I've heard from people talking negatively about care homes, I've gotta say I do find it ironic that people are encouraging OP to ignore his brothers complaints and do it anyway. The same people calling OP TA and ignoring his brothers wishes would lose their shit if it happened to a family member in a care facility. \n\nI work in care. I would refuse to wipe someone if they requested that I not do so. Everyone has a right to make a decision and to make choices on their care. They also have the right to make an unwise decision.

You can't expect his brother to just start wiping his ass, especially when the brother isn't even comfortable with it happening either.", "It is her child. He is solely HER responsibility in this situation and all others.", "Nah. She signed up for this. It's part of life to be sandwiched between two generations, & she's far from the only woman (or man, lol) alive caring for dying parent & a child with however brief a disability. Imagine if this 15 year old had deeper problems than his ass wiped & off mom had to go to wipe another ass at a hospice? Both brothers are uncomfortable with this, & mom is manipulating the 19 year old into feeling guilty for not doing her parenting for her. I think 19 needs to call CPS & ask for advice about coercion into intimate contact with a child. *That* would learn mom not to parentify.", "No but it\u2019s common decency, if you have good parents that looked after you for the first 18 years you should do what you can to return the favour", "Wow, have you ever been a member of a family?!?!  No, helping his brother will not create an irreparable mental toll...that's ridiculous.\n\nRegular visits?  So, he just needs to \"hold it\" until someone comes?!?!  Will they come overnight as well?\n\nHave you ever taken care of anyone before?", "In most cases, that means nurse visits for an hour or so 2-3 days a week and bath service twice a week.   And given that the brother doesn't need any actual medical attention, he'd be unlikely to get more than a once a week nurse to ensure that he doesn't have bedsores or some sort of infection.   They should still check though because their insurance may have other tips to make care easier for the family.   They may also provide supplies like gloves and wipes.", "Add a toilet frame and a grab bar in the shower too.    They can get everything overnight from Amazon and try it out.", "Not everything has a good alternative.", "Exactly. She had no plan all along. What if 15 had profound autism, for instance? Nah. She's passing the buck. If mom keeps forcing 19 on this, 19 needs to call CPS for advice.", ">If someone in a care home refused to have anyone wipe them they absolutely would be wiped without their consent or kicked out to lie in their own shit elsewhere.\n\nSpoken like someone who hasn't got a clue. Now I'm not exactly sure how things are in the US ill admit, but considering how backwards the healthcare system is over there i probably shouldn't be too surprised you think like that. But in places like england that actually give a shit about peoples health, No. They would HAVE to get a deprivation of liberty safeguarding (DoLs) before they could even consider doing something like that without consent and if you think someone refusing to allow someone to wipe them would mean they would be kicked out of the care home, you really are just showing a lack of experience of the industry. You really think a care home, a place that generally deals with both physical AND MENTAL health would kick someone out for displaying mental distress? And even so, I struggle to believe that the USA doesn't have some form of Mental Capacity Act. But in the entirety of Europe, you can't just force someone to be wiped without begging for a lawsuit to be filed. \n\n>So what is your solution if they can't find alternative 24 hours care on short notice? That the mother doesn't get to see her mother and grandma dies alone because of the kids preferences?\n\nI don't know what the solution is, but frankly, it's on the mother to find one. Not on her kids. And, you know, it's genuinely kind of fucked up that you think someone shouldn't be able to choose who runs their fingers down their own arsehole. Caring for someone who cannot care for themself is about what is doing best for them with their consent. Not about making mums life easier.", "Individuality?  What the hell does that have to do with anything here?  Dude, this isn't a comfort range, it isn't giving a speech in public when that makes us nervous.  It's OP wiping their younger brother's ass which NEITHER want.  But okay Boomer.", "True. When we hired someone to help with my grandfather in the late 1990s, the company charged $80 an hour with a four-hour minimum so I can only imagine what they cost now.", "Yeah I was just gonna say this.  We have been looking for months and have care covered by insurance for my dad and still have not been able to fill the hours.", "Diaper is a terrible solution.  You really need to change it ASAP, and brother would be far better off with mud butt from not wiping than wallowing around in a poopy diaper.", "The option is that the younger son goes with mom.", "Nah fuck that, you cannot force a person to wipe another persons ass. Especially if neither party wants it.", "There's pitching in then theres wiping another persons asshole when neither party wants to be in that situation. You cannot equate pitching in around the house and this. You people seem to think it equates to doing the dishes, but i can tell you if i was this person I would be incapable of doing it. Other peoples shit/piss makes me feel physically sick at the best of times let alone having to go near it.", "No it absolutely fucking isnt. When you make a choice to bring a life into this world YOU made that choice. Just because you made that choice does not mean that the child is obligated to drop everything to provide care to you when your old.", "I've watched too many people be caretakers to ailing parents, and it almost kill them, so I'll agree to disagree with you. Both of my parents did it for their parents, too many cousins and friends do it for their parents.  \n\nIt's heartbreaking to watch someone lose themselves in caretaker syndrome and other mental health issues that come along with it.  \n\nReturning the favor can also be by making sure you and they can have a meaningful and caring end to their life journey. And that is sometimes putting them in a facility or home.", "Yea I have, against my wishes, which is why I kmow how damaging it can be.  Expecting siblings to carry out this type of care is horrendous,  especially when both siblings are against it.", "Those wipes are not actually flushable in the USA, and honestly, I doubt they're really flushable in Germany either.\n\nThey may technically go down the pipe, but then they don't decompose and so they make a big mess in the sewer that your city has to clean up once people start getting backups.", "CPS will laugh in his face.", "What would you do if your so died, your mother was on death's door and one of your kids broke both arms? She's not abusive just because life is hitting her hard all at once. What a ridiculous thing to say.", "We don't always have plans for emergency situations or unexpected injuries. That doesn't make her a bad parent. Sometimes being part of a family means pulling your weight in unpleasant ways.", "I mean, you put me right in my place with the last comment. \n\nWhat a cop out.\n\nNo one wants to wipe anyone\u2019s ass. It\u2019s a life truth. Yet\u2026.. people who take of others sometimes do. Plenty of things we don\u2019t want to do have to be done and that\u2019s how it works.", "Ah. Understood. Gotta suck for them because, holy hell, that hurt!!!! Mine was a couple years back.", "That's insane. My neighbor was a CNA and she was getting $13 an hour, paid for her own gas, and wasn't compensated for travel time at ALL. And that's just a few years ago.", "Assuming he is cleared to fly. And that they can afford that. And that he doesn\u2019t have any medical appointments/treatments scheduled. And that the hospice will allow him to be there.", "So she has to care for him while her mother is dying, assuming he is even cleared to fly? \n\nOr her two children could have a little bit of compassion for their mother and deal with a slightly uncomfortable situation?", "In my family we support each other, clearly your values are different.", "Home health aids have had background checks, and may even be bonded.  It wouldn't be safe to allow a random, homeless person to live in the house with the injured 15 year old.", "That\u2019s what it does.", "The bidet will keep him cleaner than a lot of guys get with toilet paper.   Also, OP can use a shower spray head and keep him extra clean without zero scrubbing.", "Loose sweatpants are easy to take off without arms. Bathing doesn't seem to be the main issue here but mom can bathe him I'm willing to bet he would prefer that", "> how does a bidet solve that?\n\nDo you know what a bidet is?", "I guess grandma can die alone and mom doesn't get to see her mother ever again because the kids have preferences. That's fair and correct. A lot of the comments are being delusional about the possibility of finding alternative care on short notice.", "Cop out, really?  Lmao you're killing me.\n\nBy all means, continue to be obtuse about this situation; I won't be wasting any more of my time trying to explain it to you.", "It was verified by a university professor, as they'd documented the case.", "I don't know what the CNA was being paid (probably a lot less), but that's what the company charged. We needed someone right away and didn't know where else to look to find someone.", "Couple different options... Bro could help him sit down, he could \"dangle\"... or, if he's really not wanting to expose his junk to his bro, mom could have a foley catheter placed before leaving, then all bro would need to do would be to empty the bag. Much less comfortable tho.", "My mother has passed and I am dealing with my father who is in his 90\u2019s and has dementia. That doesn\u2019t mean I still don\u2019t have to be a parent.", "This. And she's a piece of work trying to guilt trip him about it. Just wow.", "Yes in my family, we are treated as equals and when two people express that they don't want to carry out intimate care it doesn't happen. Imagine a world where children have a choice in who sees them in vulnerable, uncomfortable positions, what a world that would be.", "> they didn't believe in ADD, because \"no one actually has it\"\n\nIn my area, this has now shifted and kids are being told \"everyone has ADHD these days. It's not a big deal, just take your meds.\"\n\nNew message, same impact", "In contrast, in my family, we're not so selfish as to refuse to help out another family member.  Imagine a world where someone puts aside feeling awkward, in order to help care for family members....what a world it would be."]}
