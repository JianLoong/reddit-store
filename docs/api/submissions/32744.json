It is a human duty and beauty to care for the weakers of our group.\n\nI think that it is dehumanising way to consider your family, to not be able to care or to be cared for by their members (looking at your brother too) when in weakness or in sickness.

I'm wondering why she has to go now.  I know hospice means your grandma has 6 months or less to live (sorry about that) but leaving a minor child who can't use either arm is a pretty big deal.  Even if it's with his older brother.  So I'd first check that this is a true need and not just a knee jerk reaction to her being admitted into hospice.  \n\nNext has she spoken with the insurance company for your brother?  They have a lot of benefits people don't think of.  Like people who can come in and help part of the time.  Most often home health aides.  Keep in mind there's typically limitations and it won't be 24/7 care.  But it can help relieve the burden on you.  If you as a family do go ahead and hire help you can coordinate with anything available through the insurance to help keep cost down.  24/7 care is ridiculously expensive.  Avoid it if at all possible.", "NTA for not wanting to do certain things for him. Full time in home care is quite expensive, we were just paying almost $20,000/mo for my mom before moving her to a care home. Ask his doctor to request therapy/nursing to aid in his care that should be covered by insurance. It\u2019s not full time care, just drop ins but someone can come out and assist with bathing him, typically two or three times a week. Adding the bidet as previously suggested is a great idea.

But your Mom is going to lose her mother. You two need to suck it up and deal.  It\u2019s for a short period of time and a temporary situation.  Also, some states will offer home care assistance.

Do that!!", "NTA\n\nPeople may choose to work in a caring role (occupation wise) but not everyone wants to.  Some are put into that position and don't have much choice ie they are a parent.  They may also be co-erced and feel like they have no choice.  There is also a very large difference to someone providing general care ie help with cooking and cleaning help with personal care ie bathing and wiping butts.  Much easier to do this for a baby/toddler if it's your sibling than it is an older child and a 15 year old is well and truly big enough to voice their opinion.  In this case the 15 year old is not even giving consent for his brother to provide this care so it actually comes down to assault if he says no.  He's allowing his mother to do it but not his brother.  This may come down to a safety issue if it gets too far down the track ie infection from poor hygiene but it's not at that point yet.\n\nAlso getting someone who doesn't want to care for another person, and especially when one of those isn't even giving consent can mean that very poor care is given and things aren't done so you are left in the same position as giving no care.\n\nWhat I would like to know is how long has he been in this cast for and how much longer will he be in this cast?  And what was broken?  Was it an elbow?  Is there a bend in his cast or is it straight out?  Depending on what was broken and how long ago it may be possible to replace the current cast with a new, cast that may be smaller or one that allows you more mobility to  attend to much of your own personal care.  You can also get waterproof fibrecast casts.  You can shower with these but I don't normally recommend it (you'd have trouble drying all the inside when the water gets in if it's cold or if you are sweaty) but it would allow you to wash your face and splash the cast a little if you did shower with plastic over it ie it's not going to turn to mush in places like a plaster cast might.  They are also a lot lighter.\n\nNow none of that may be possible but I'd be speaking to a physiotherapist as to what care aids are available to help your brother wipe his arse and help himself pull his underwear and pants back up... though he may be okay with a dress/skirt (in a manly fashion) so less to worry about.\n\nIs there another family member or friend that can help out?  This is for the bigger things like a shower.  Or could he stay with another family member or friend (if he's close to the parents or friends, he and they might be okay with some personal care)?\n\nHow long will your mom likely be gone?  This is hospice care and not palliative care.  People can be in hospice for a long time before passing or moving on to other care (or even recovering).\n\nDepending on why your grandmother is in hospice care, does your mother need to go right now or can she go after her injured and care requiring son has recovered enough to be able to wipe his own bum?  Your mother does have competing interests here - her mother and her son... but if he were my son I would stay and if he were my grandson, I'd expect my daughter to stay and care for him.  This is very different to if grandmother was going to die in the next few days and you need to go... but then I would think she would be taking all of you unless you don't have a relationship with your grandmother.", "You can hire a nurse's aid to do the bathing.

That's not hundreds of dollars' a week, that's thousands of dollars a week.  It would likely be cheaper for the brother to be admitted to a care home.\n\nUnless this family is absurdly wealthy, the choices are, the OP grows up, and supports his family, or the mother can't go to her dying mother.", "Neither of them want this to be happening though", "but what about the younger brothers wishes to not have his older brother assist him with that? should those just be ignored?", "Unless the family is very wealthy, the only other solution is the mother can't go to her dying mother.", "Honestly? OPs opinion isn't really the issue here. It's the brother. He has explicitly stated he does not want OP to wipe his butt. If the brother was in a care facility and he said he didn't want a particular staff member to wipe him and that staff member ended up doing it anyway, there's a very good chance that the staff member in question would lose their job and end up in prison on charges of abuse. For all the shit I've heard from people talking negatively about care homes, I've gotta say I do find it ironic that people are encouraging OP to ignore his brothers complaints and do it anyway. The same people calling OP TA and ignoring his brothers wishes would lose their shit if it happened to a family member in a care facility. \n\nI work in care. I would refuse to wipe someone if they requested that I not do so. Everyone has a right to make a decision and to make choices on their care. They also have the right to make an unwise decision.

Will the brother only have to go to the bathroom M-F from 8-4???\n\nSure, see if insurance will pay for some in-home care.  But the brother needs assistance available 24/7.\n\nIt would be cheaper to admit the brother to a nursing home for the weeks the mother is gone.", "Lighten up, Francis", "Please tell me that was a made up story like the stuff you see on r/greentext. I had heard about it but always thought it wasn't real.", "If there were still awards I would give it to this boys guy friends. Awesome.", "I also taught high school. The school was supposed to have hired a paraprofessional to do that, and frankly it\u2019s disgusting that they made that poor boy ask his friends to help him with toileting instead of fulfilling their legal obligations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nI agree that OP can and should help, but in your story it\u2019s not even remotely okay that the school neglected that child.", "???\nI don't understand the question. Is this a reference to something?", "We tried to find a caregiver for my dad.  They said it would be at least 2-3weeks for someone to even be available.  It is not as easy as most people think", "You can schedule bath time, but you cannot schedule the brother's toilet visits. Someone would either need to be present at all time to deal with 'em, or he'd have to wear a diaper.", "Will you be paying for the home health aide for OP's mom?  The weekly cost of an aide, assuming they can get one, in my area is $716.  This is for 40 hours.  Will brother only be using the bathroom during this appointed time?  Will he be holding it the other 16 hours a day?  How long will grandma be in hospice?  Do you think mom should just let her mother die alone because OP doesn't want to be uncomfortable?  The fact is that getting an aide on short notice is nearly impossible.  A single mom having an extra $716 a week to pay someone is also unlikely.  OP says he'll help with the cost.  Realistically, where is a 19 year old going to get $716 a week, especially when he says he is does not have a job?  In this case, OP needs to suck it up and help his brother.  OP is between semesters and not working.  He should be pitching in during an emergency.", "Not ignoring it, rather being realistic in that when you are this level of injured there is going to be a lot you have to put up with that is embarrassing and uncomfortable, simply because there is no other option. Brother probably also doesn't want his mom to be wiping his ass at age 15, but he's had to deal with that too.\n\nHiring a full-time carer is not going to be a realistic option. They cost *a lot* of money. In many places, there is a wait list for them, so you might not even be able to find one within the time frame needed. Depending on where they are/insurance, mom probably already has plenty of hospital bills just from brother's injury, and if she is having to take off time from work to transfer her mom to hospice that is even less money coming in.\n\nBig bro doesn't want to wipe his ass, little bro doesn't want to be wiped. But realistically, what is *actually* going to be the option here?", "OP is unemployed.  Where will he be getting thousands of dollars for a home health aide, last minute, over the holidays?", "It's not cool on the 19 yo either and honestly, it's not his responsibility. I missed the part about the plane but it's still not on the brother. He said no, it's now on the mother to figure something else out and if that means taking ***her*** son with her, so be it, he's 15, not 5, he can deal with it. Sounds like the 15yo fucked around and is now finding out. It's not on his brother to deal with the consequences.", "Wow, so you'd invite a random homeless person to live in the house with Mom gone and an injured son?!?!", ">It will cost hundreds of dollars.\n\na day!", "there is even wet toilet paper that you can throw in the toilet, at least here in germany", "OP is not his brothers parent, OPs mom is trying to parentify him and put him and op\u2019s brother in a situation neither are comfortable with. OP and his brother are allowed to have boundaries.  If Ops mom can\u2019t afford care she should stay home and take care of her child.  Her child should come before her mother and if her mom going into hospice she most likely has health insurance that may cover some of her expenses, if it does not cover all it would probably still be cheaper to hire someone for her mom than for her son. Edit to add: or she can take op\u2019s brother with her as another Reddit poster said.", "The younger brother doesn't want someone to rub paper on their asshole and you're saying that he should be forced to have that happen? There are better options like a bidet or jump in the shower when he's done. They don't need to suck it up they need basic problem solving", "consent is optional now? They can figure out something else instead of guilting everyone involved for feeling uncomfortable.", "I cannot imagine a hospice allowing this.  You evidently have not experienced what death is like.\n\nEdit to add:  Brother is an adult.  Plenty of people his age work in facilities doing exactly this work.", "We have a great relationship, with lots of jokes. We just do not joke about anything that's remotely tied to any trauma. Maybe because we actually love and respect each other. Strange, I know. \n\nAs far as OP goes, he nor his brother are ok with it. That's the mother's responsibility, not OP's. She needs to handle her business. OP is NTA", "One can only hope it wasn't real but it's definitely became legendary.", "I believe it was verified", "I retired almost 30 years ago and this situation took place a dozen years before I retired.\n\nThings were different then.", "Yes. Popular talk show host had ruptured appendix two weeks ago and has had to cancel a few weeks of shows.", "Precisely this. Either he's all in or a carer is all in.", "I mean, most people have time of day that they generally poop. If one is \u201cregular\u201d\u2026", "He said he has savings, who knows how much that is, he's just not working while he's on holidays for school which is incredibly common", "It's absolutely his responsibility to take care of a family member and support his mother. He's a grown man and his mother is going to help *her mother* who is dying.  \n\n\"I don't wanna\" is not a good enough answer in this situation. If my son kept me from helping my dying mother because he was squeamish I would literally never forgive him for it.", "No I would wipe my brothers ass cause I can be a responsible person who helps family in need but clearly OP won\u2019t do that so maybe a stranger is the option.", "We have what is called flushable wipes here in America as well, But I learned the hard way, at least in America, nothing really breaks down like it should in our plumbing other than toilet paper.  (When I had to get a professional in for a toilet problem).  It is especially true if you have well water/septic tank.  A plumbing/sewage problem can be very costly.", "I agree fully with you. Maybe I just am over kids being forced to take care of their siblings but, not his kid, not his problem. I have 2 daughters, if it were me, I'd be taking my child with me. Sure it wouldn't be easy but I brought them into the world so it's ***my***  responsibility.", "'Parentify'! Good grief we are not talking about a youngster being ask to parent younger siblings, it's an exceptional circumstance where an adult man (who has given no indication he's parented his brother) is being ask to help out.", "So you use a bidet sure, but someone still has to pull down his pants\u2026and get him \u201csetup\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s also the bathing aspect\u2026he has to wash out his ass\u2026how does a bidet solve that?", "...when it's your health and the reasons for removing consent to be cared for platonically likely stems from homophobia, yes. Infections from not cleaning can get deadly. I", "Because I advocated for a parent to, checks notes, *parent* her own kids and figure out care for them I obviously have not experienced what death is like? A very reasonable conclusion.", "I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re getting downvoted for saying people shouldn\u2019t joke about trauma. It ceases to be a joke. And this certainly sounds like a distressing thing for both brothers. Nothing light hearted about it.", "I'm scared to ask how one would verify that.", "The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was law for 7 years at that point.", "And what about urinating?", "Actually it's not but obviously we're not going to agree. She can ask and he can answer but fact is it's not his responsibility.", "Exactly and anyone who says that whole but your mother took care of you stuff needs to remember that is a parents responsibility they knew the sacrifices when they choose to have children and it is legally required unless you give up your parental rights lol.  Children have no choice in being born or the number of siblings they have, so not their responsibility to take care of them. Edit to add: no one should ever be forced to touch another person\u2019s private areas or be forced to have someone touch them there against their will and OPs mom is trying to force both her kids to give up their bodily autonomy, how are people not seeing how messed up that is and no it\u2019s not different just because it\u2019s family, seriously wtf.", "So, you'd be a caregiver for your injured son 24/7,  while taking care of your mother in hospice?  This is after making your son with two broken arms, who can't toilet himself, fly to where his grandmother lives?   What if he has to go to the bathroom on the plane?\n\nThe OP and the brother both need to grow up.  It will be awkward and uncomfortable, but they can both do it.", "...homophobia? You think the only reason a 15-year-old boy would not want his adult brother wiping his ass in the bathroom is a fear of looking *gay?* I am actually gay and I would scream bloody murder about not having a sibling clean my butt after pooping.\n\nAlso, consent and boundaries are exceptionally important when it comes to people touching intimate parts of your body and they remain so even if you don't like the reasoning behind them. Even if the brother were being homophobic, that wouldn't make it okay to ignore his boundaries here.", "I assume it's because these folks are okay with trauma humor. Can't control what they do. I just refuse to be cruel enough to mock someone's trauma.", "Because they don't think the little brothers feelings on the matter mean anything. There's a common theme amongst the YTA voters and that's that they're all ignoring the fact OPs brother does not consent to this.", "I taught in an urban school system. \n\nThey were chronically underfunded and barely managed IEP documents for identified students with learning problems, let alone physically disabled students.  \n\nThe solution was to send those with physical disabilities to a special school at the county hospital.   It was far from a \"least restrictive environment\" and his parents insisted upon mainstreaming.", "That means almost nothing.\nStill, in roughly OP's era, we had school districts with no plan in place for kids with IEPs because they didn't have any. And they didn't believe in ADD, because \"no one actually has it\".\n\nJust because there was a law doesn't mean every school in every corner of the country had yet figured out that it meant THEM, nor that every family had yet pushed to have it enforced regarding their kids.\n\nYep, the school should have done better. But we sure didn't have paraprofessionals or aids in MY school back then, either.", "Precisely. I'm taking care of my girls, not so I can throw it in their faces later but because I'm the one who decided they needed to be here so why would it be on them? My 4yo is very kind to bring me things when I ask but if she says no then okay, it's on me to figure out a solution even if it's not convenient. \n\nI'm not seeing the logic here, would it be kind of OP? Absolutely. But is he an AH for saying no? Not at all. I'd honestly say NAH as my verdict. Mom isn't the AH for asking but neither is OP for saying no because they'd both be uncomfortable", "Seriously! Some of these replies are shocking. I know it\u2019s easy to tell OP to \u201cstep up,\u201d but I wonder how they would feel about their own brother or sister wiping their ass for six weeks. Or being \u201cobligated\u201d (aka: forced into something you don\u2019t want to do due to relation) to wipe their brother or sister\u2019s ass after poops or periods for six weeks. Maybe then they would sympathize with OP and his brother, Idk.", "I like you and you sound like a great parent,  your kids are lucky to have a parent who respects them.", "I bet all those down voting us also don\u2019t think they need an invite/permission to touch a pregnant woman\u2019s belly especially if they related (they wrong) or would bully a pregnant woman into letting someone she not comfortable with (like a mil or her own mother) into the delivery room because once again family and well they\u2019ve done it before (again wrong because people are allowed boundaries with their families yet that concept is so hard to grasp for some). Also if this was a brother sister they might see how wrong it is but honestly after reading some of the comments I\u2019m not so sure they would lol."]}
