Mostly skullgirls.\n\nUntil this group of 2 boys around 20 or so want to play with us, we say sure obviously and both of them sit on either side of to me.(We have 2 laptops out next to each other and we're all sitting in a row.) With me on in the middle of the two dudes and my friends who are nb and female down the row.\n\nNow this game has a LOT of jiggly physics & panty shots, the whole galore but no real nudity and you can't really even focous on it while getting your shit rocked by my friends who are fucking amazing at this game.\n\nWe start teaching the dudes the controls, telling them our favorite characters and ya know generally joking around about \"booba haha.\"\n\nBut after a while I notice that the dude I'm sitting next to on the outeredge has a RAGING hard on\nAnd I'm super emberassed this is the first time I've seen some dude hard in a public place and i realize that he also must be mortified and try & do the dude a solid and sit down- pretend it isn't happening. But 10 minutes pass and he's still going.\n\nAt this point it is super hard for me to focus on the game and this might be the point where I'm thinking I was an asshole. \nI didn't know whether or not it'd be okay to just get up and dip, feeling like that would've been worst.\nSo I quietly tell the guy. \n\n\"It's okay bro, I got you I'll just move. No worries.\" Basically. My thinking is we're both very uncomfortable this most likely sucks for us both.\n\n\nSo I get up, fuck around for a bit, come back and tell my friends I'm going to practice my art. Just trying to make my move look as natural as possible. \n\nWhich i guess failed bc they were confused and notice the dudes ya know.\nNb friend literally just says \"bruh.\"\nOther friend concerned for my safety I guess, asks me if I'm okay.\n\nHard-on guys friend notices what's going on and immediately gets SUPER defensive of his friend.\nStarts telling them, \"Of course she's okay he didn't do anything.\"\n\nWhich I agree to, yeah I'm like \"I'm cool, nothings wrong.\"\n\nBut this interaction sours the gaming mood so awkwardly after another five minutes they get up to leave with one muttering about how we \"honey trapped\" His friend and him into playing a \"sex-game\" and making a big scene when he had a natural reaction to it. Told me I should've just sat there and not said anything at all.\n\n He basically agreed with him and he genuinely seemed about to cry so I'm feeling really fucking awful at this point. \n\nI say I'm really sorry but my friends tell me that I shouldn't apologize and they were in the wrong for the way they handled it.

That doesn\u2019t make you the asshole. You didn\u2019t make a show of it, ridicule him, or anything else. You just left. Don\u2019t make yourself uncomfortable for the sake of others. NTA", "NTA. wtf, he's not a middle schooler going through puberty, he's had plenty of experience dealing with inappropriate/sudden erections. the fact he sat there for over *ten bloody minutes* and did nothing to cover himself, calm himself down, or even take himself out of the situation is telling. dude knew wtf he was doing", "Guys start getting awkward boners around age 13; by 13\u00bd we become very adept at hiding them. I'm in my early 50s, it still happens, and I've known how to hide it for 40 years. If this perv's stiffie was so obvious that everyone could take note of it he was letting it be noted purposely and was fucking advertising it.  His perv friends trying to accuse you of 'honey-trapping' is pure gaslighting.\n\nYou are 100% NTA and handled it as gracefully as possible.", "NTA, you were uncomfortable in that situation so you moved. He\u2019s friend is an asshole for trying to make you look bad when you were uncomfortable", "NTA you felt uncomfortable, he doesn't need to stick his boner to you or touch you to make you uncomfortable so his friend is an AH. If he saw that he had that problem getting excited by playing erotic games, he should have excused himself from playing or sat next to his friend and not next to people he didn't know and could feel uncomfortable with his erection. Also, as other comments say, he did nothing to try to solve the problem, he knew what was happening and tried to play the idiot. I can understand you OP, somehow when you're a girl who likes that stuff (I have participated in comic forums and I also play games) men believe they have the right to have bad behavior and then justify it with: \"honey trapped\" or \"flirting\" or anything that never happened. I'm sorry about this because it may not be the last time you go through this.", "NTA - I read it twice to check but if you had said a few years younger it might be a little less \"shocking\".  By 20 the guy should be more skilled at hiding the situation.\n\nAs a teenager I once saw a friend's dad stop us at the door on the way out and when I looked back it was a similar situation.  The dad made him change into some pants that would camouflage the situation.\n\nIt sounds like this never happened for this dude.", "Yeaaa. You \u201c honey trapped\u201d the little innocents into playing a \u201csex game\u201d.   You bad girls. \n\nI roll my eyes. \n\nThis us why we can\u2019t have nice things. NTA and may the *next* people you play with with possess the mental development of an actual adult next time.", "NTA.\nYou are not responsible for this guy's body and how he reacts. No one was trying to trap him, and you're under NO obligation to stay in a situation that makes you uncomfortable.", "Never question yourself about leaving when someone is making you uncomfortable. I would stay away from those two in the future.  I dont think they are very nice guys. Unfortunately,  the gaming and hobbyist culture can attract all types. So just like the general population, there can be a few bad elements.", "[removed]", "NTA.  The normal move is to simply adjust so it is not an issue discretely or excuse oneself until you not pitching a tent for the whole world to see.", "Under no circumstances is it socially normal for a guy to carry himself like that at a public place. NTA.", "NTA you were uncomfortable so you moved away it's not your fault.", "NTA. You were uncomfortable. Period. You don\u2019t owe him or his friend or anyone else an explanation as to why you removed yourself from a situation or why you chose to sit elsewhere. Yeah, shit happens. But self control is a thing. \nHE should\u2019ve removed himself from the situation until he could get it under control and if he can\u2019t control his response whatsoever then he should be removing himself entirely and not be playing suggestive games in public around others. It\u2019s absolutely idiotic that they think you are somehow in the wrong. And it\u2019s 100% wrong for them to blame YOU. NTA one bit.", "NTA. You sound like a really kind person, it was just an uncomfortable experience for everyone and there were multiple reactions involved. You weren\u2019t trying to embarrass him or call attention to it. Sometimes we accidentally cause harm to other people, even though we didn\u2019t do anything wrong, if that makes sense. It was a negative experience for him, but it wasn\u2019t your fault. As you get older, it will get a little easier to brush off guilt for things you can\u2019t control.\n\nI was going to vote NAH, but his friends crossed a line when trying to defend him.", "NTA. \n\nI would have moved to the front and let a staff member know. This guy may have a kink or it may be accidental. You are a 20yo confident enough to remove yourself from the situation. Next time the person might not. Staff can also keep an eye for repeat occurrences.", "NTA.  He should know how to better handle situations of his own making by now.", "Nta, youre interacting with actual children", "Hold on, \n\nThey asked to play the game with you. \n\nAnd now they\u2019re accusing you of \u201choney trapping\u201d him?\n\nNTA, the group of boys are obviously pervs.", "NTA. As a guy, I would have excused myself imeditely to go fix the issue. He didn't and it was making you uncomfortable so you moved.", "Nta you tried to do the \"gentlemanly\" thing and dip out quietly. He should have done the same. Very confused perhaps under the illusion that no one had noticed??? The friend is a bit too much too lol \n\nNo one was making a big deal except that guy which drew attention to his friend and probably embarrassed him.\n\nComic book places are full of awkward experiences!", "NTA\n\nHe didn't even try to hide it. If he was \"so embarrassed,\" he would have done something about it. My bet is it's a kink, and he was embarrassed everyone caught on to it.", "Info: Game? What in God's name were you playing?\n\nWhat game is horny enough that this man has popped a noticeable boner in public and still appropriate to play in a comic book shop?\n\n20 year olds should know how to control their boners to some degree. Like no reason boners happen but you manage that shit.", "Absolutely NTA, you were uncomfortable and had every reason to move. He\u2019s a creep sitting there not trying to hide it and expect you to be ok with it\u2026probably getting off on you sitting next to him.\nDon\u2019t let them make you feel bad, good for you for moving.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
