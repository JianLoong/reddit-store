But 10 minutes pass and he's still going.\n\nAt this point it is super hard for me to focus on the game and this might be the point where I'm thinking I was an asshole. \nI didn't know whether or not it'd be okay to just get up and dip, feeling like that would've been worst.\nSo I quietly tell the guy. \n\n\"It's okay bro, I got you I'll just move. No worries.\" Basically. My thinking is we're both very uncomfortable this most likely sucks for us both.\n\n\nSo I get up, fuck around for a bit, come back and tell my friends I'm going to practice my art. Just trying to make my move look as natural as possible. \n\nWhich i guess failed bc they were confused and notice the dudes ya know.\nNb friend literally just says \"bruh.\"\nOther friend concerned for my safety I guess, asks me if I'm okay.\n\nHard-on guys friend notices what's going on and immediately gets SUPER defensive of his friend.\nStarts telling them, \"Of course she's okay he didn't do anything.\"\n\nWhich I agree to, yeah I'm like \"I'm cool, nothings wrong.\"\n\nBut this interaction sours the gaming mood so awkwardly after another five minutes they get up to leave with one muttering about how we \"honey trapped\" His friend and him into playing a \"sex-game\" and making a big scene when he had a natural reaction to it. Told me I should've just sat there and not said anything at all.\n\n He basically agreed with him and he genuinely seemed about to cry so I'm feeling really fucking awful at this point. \n\nI say I'm really sorry but my friends tell me that I shouldn't apologize and they were in the wrong for the way they handled it.

I'm in my early 50s, it still happens, and I've known how to hide it for 40 years. If this perv's stiffie was so obvious that everyone could take note of it he was letting it be noted purposely and was fucking advertising it.  His perv friends trying to accuse you of 'honey-trapping' is pure gaslighting.\n\nYou are 100% NTA and handled it as gracefully as possible.", "NTA, you were uncomfortable in that situation so you moved. He\u2019s friend is an asshole for trying to make you look bad when you were uncomfortable", "NTA you felt uncomfortable, he doesn't need to stick his boner to you or touch you to make you uncomfortable so his friend is an AH. If he saw that he had that problem getting excited by playing erotic games, he should have excused himself from playing or sat next to his friend and not next to people he didn't know and could feel uncomfortable with his erection. Also, as other comments say, he did nothing to try to solve the problem, he knew what was happening and tried to play the idiot. I can understand you OP, somehow when you're a girl who likes that stuff (I have participated in comic forums and I also play games) men believe they have the right to have bad behavior and then justify it with: \"honey trapped\" or \"flirting\" or anything that never happened. I'm sorry about this because it may not be the last time you go through this.", "NTA - I read it twice to check but if you had said a few years younger it might be a little less \"shocking\".  By 20 the guy should be more skilled at hiding the situation.\n\nAs a teenager I once saw a friend's dad stop us at the door on the way out and when I looked back it was a similar situation.  The dad made him change into some pants that would camouflage the situation.\n\nIt sounds like this never happened for this dude.", "Yeaaa.

No one was trying to trap him, and you're under NO obligation to stay in a situation that makes you uncomfortable.", "Never question yourself about leaving when someone is making you uncomfortable. I would stay away from those two in the future.  I dont think they are very nice guys. Unfortunately,  the gaming and hobbyist culture can attract all types. So just like the general population, there can be a few bad elements.", "[removed]", "NTA.

You don\u2019t owe him or his friend or anyone else an explanation as to why you removed yourself from a situation or why you chose to sit elsewhere. Yeah, shit happens. But self control is a thing. \nHE should\u2019ve removed himself from the situation until he could get it under control and if he can\u2019t control his response whatsoever then he should be removing himself entirely and not be playing suggestive games in public around others. It\u2019s absolutely idiotic that they think you are somehow in the wrong. And it\u2019s 100% wrong for them to blame YOU. NTA one bit.", "NTA. You sound like a really kind person, it was just an uncomfortable experience for everyone and there were multiple reactions involved. You weren\u2019t trying to embarrass him or call attention to it. Sometimes we accidentally cause harm to other people, even though we didn\u2019t do anything wrong, if that makes sense. It was a negative experience for him, but it wasn\u2019t your fault. As you get older, it will get a little easier to brush off guilt for things you can\u2019t control.\n\nI was going to vote NAH, but his friends crossed a line when trying to defend him.", "NTA. \n\nI would have moved to the front and let a staff member know. This guy may have a kink or it may be accidental. You are a 20yo confident enough to remove yourself from the situation. Next time the person might not. Staff can also keep an eye for repeat occurrences.", "NTA.  He should know how to better handle situations of his own making by now.", "Nta, youre interacting with actual children", "Hold on, \n\nThey asked to play the game with you. \n\nAnd now they\u2019re accusing you of \u201choney trapping\u201d him?\n\nNTA, the group of boys are obviously pervs.", "NTA. As a guy, I would have excused myself imeditely to go fix the issue. He didn't and it was making you uncomfortable so you moved.", "Nta you tried to do the \"gentlemanly\" thing and dip out quietly. He should have done the same. Very confused perhaps under the illusion that no one had noticed??? The friend is a bit too much too lol \n\nNo one was making a big deal except that guy which drew attention to his friend and probably embarrassed him.\n\nComic book places are full of awkward experiences!", "NTA\n\nHe didn't even try to hide it. If he was \"so embarrassed,\" he would have done something about it. My bet is it's a kink, and he was embarrassed everyone caught on to it.", "Info: Game? What in God's name were you playing?\n\nWhat game is horny enough that this man has popped a noticeable boner in public and still appropriate to play in a comic book shop?\n\n20 year olds should know how to control their boners to some degree.

You and your friends were just existing while playing a game that had some oversexualized characters (I googled it, while clearly sexualized, it also didnt seem like that uncommon of a level considering how normalized barely covered huge boobs are in a lot of games).
