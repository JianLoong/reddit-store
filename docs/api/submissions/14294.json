No more discussion. Apparently this attitude that your time is your own and your consent IS required is still unfamiliar to your sister. She'll get used to it with consistency. Let her have her meltdowns somewhere else.\n\nFYI, if you don't let her in and tell her to leave, and she refuses, you could call the police to remove a trespasser.

Maybe because I\u2019m the oldest, but I\u2019m the only one who will tell her when she\u2019s being ridiculous and call her out. I\u2019m the only one who won\u2019t drop everything for a non-emergency, and I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t put up with it. I love her to death, we still have a great relationship, but I don\u2019t play her games, and I won\u2019t sacrifice my mental health for her main character syndrome."]}
