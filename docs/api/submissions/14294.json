You didn't back down or \"compromise\" some of your time and resources. You stuck to your very normal and healthy boundary that you do not accept responsibilities you haven't agreed to carry. Period. No more discussion. Apparently this attitude that your time is your own and your consent IS required is still unfamiliar to your sister. She'll get used to it with consistency. Let her have her meltdowns somewhere else.\n\nFYI, if you don't let her in and tell her to leave, and she refuses, you could call the police to remove a trespasser.

Maybe because I\u2019m the oldest, but I\u2019m the only one who will tell her when she\u2019s being ridiculous and call her out. I\u2019m the only one who won\u2019t drop everything for a non-emergency, and I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t put up with it.

Your sister sounds awful. I wish you the best in setting boundaries.", "Your sister is weird but im even more confused by your behaviour. I mean firstly you clearly catered to her needs like a personal servant for many years despite knowing its wrong and complaining about it. Otherwise she wouldn't be demanding this from you like this. It was the norm before and you facilitated that.\n\n\nAnd even saying no finally, you're 'asking' her to leave, saying 'sorry' and acting like you had no choice but to acquiesce to her demands and feel like you need to give good reasons excuses for saying no?\n\n\nPersonally I feel like you have as much, if not more, work to do on yourself than your sister.

I mean, I've heard of favouritism, but wlhat kind of parents do you have that actually *allowed* your sister to hand you a fucking list of chores to do for her ??\n\nI'm sorry but...I just can't wrap my head around this level of insanity, or fathom why it took you til the age of 27 to finally stand up for yourself.  I'm glad you finally have, and I hope, for your own sake you stick to your guns.

Then she has to REMEMBER each of those things on her own.", "If she has a key, change the lock.

Next time light the list on fire in front of her.", "Nta, she was able to drive to your house to demand you do shit for her. She had all the ability to do it herself.
