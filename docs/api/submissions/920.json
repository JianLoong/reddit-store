Although I live in the same city as my mother (44F) and father (49M), I moved from their home about 5 years ago to go to college. I already have my degree and a steady job.\nLast summer my mom wanted us to have a \u201cfamily trip\u201d and go to the beach for a couple of weeks. She booked a triple room in a nice hotel and paid for it (even though I insisted on paying my share).\nWhen we got there we immediately went to the beach and had a lot of fun. However, when I went to sleep, I heard moans and noises coming from my parents bed which was next to mine. I tried to ignore it at first, but on the 2nd night I could still hear it and it made me very uncomfortable.\nI confronted them the next morning and my father said \u201cI should be happy that they still have sex\u201d. \nI tried to get a single room for myself but the hotel was fully booked for summer.\nSo by the 3rd night I decided to go out since nightlife at this city was known to be great. I met a lot of people from different states and countries and had the greatest time. Since many of them would be there during the whole summer, I kept going out until the end of my trip. I would get at the hotel by early morning while my parents would go out to the beach and I would sleep throughout the morning.\nAfter the trip was over, my mother said she was \u201cvery upset\u201d with me because I wouldn\u2019t be with my parents at our \u201cfamily vacation\u201d. I explained her that it was disturbing for me to explicitly hear them having sex for 2 nights in a row after talking to them about it. They haven\u2019t spoken to me since.\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: wow, I didn\u2019t expect to get so many responses. To make some things clear - I was born from an unplanned pregnancy and pretty much was raised by my grandparents (they are also the ones who paid for my college education). My parents always had a toxic relationship between each other and I guess they never really thought about me as their responsibility. Unfortunately my grandparents passed a few years ago and my mom has been trying to \u201creconnect\u201d with me since. I took this trip because I thought it would be an opportunity to bond and actually create a stable relationship but it\u2019s not what happened. My therapist has been helping me with it and I\u2019m starting to understand all of this is not my fault.

OP's parents getting upset at them not wanting to be in the room while they fuck is completely different.", "Wait seriously? Like they would have sex in front of their children? Or in the same room when the child wasnt there?", "It's even worse because their daughter was raised by her grandparents and doesn't know her parents very well.  So they're trying to establish a relationship with their grown daughter by making her listen to them having sex.  Thank God they didn't raise her.

Mom tried to wash it and give it back, but failed. Turns out the mom confessed she was role-playing as her daughter and talked her dad into it.", "I replied to someone else with it. I can copy and paste if you would like?", "That makes sense. Thanks for explaining!", "I've literally never heard of this. It's either one bed to sleep two people, or two beds that each sleep two people.

Then the further you go back the more normal it was.\n\nPeople had a completely different view on things like sex, it was seen as a normal bodily function. People at the time would probably have not seen it as much difference to having a meal (for example).\n\nPeople only see it as wrong now due to current society norms, there is nothing instinctual that makes you think sex should be a private thing, it's a product of upbringing.", "Can I borrow your purse so I can vomit in it? \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e", "Idk whether to upvote you or downvote you \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 this is revolting information lol thanks for sharing & the TLDR", "I'll check your comments, all good thanks!", "Reasonably common in UK/Europe but generally it's one double bed and a sofa that converts to a single/twin by taking off the bulky back cushions etc. Most of the time though it's intended for a child/young teen rather than another adult.", "Literally no one is saying it isn\u2019t messed up. \n\nI cannot believe you actually think that\u2019s what people who discuss historical information are doing - you have to be being deliberately obtuse.", "Yeah I knew about families sharing one room in the past and in many poorer areas currently, but I assumed the parents would wait until the kids were outside at least", "Why are you being downvotes?!?

Kinda gross but interesting lol", "Cause people would rather reject history that doesn't suit their nice little world view on how things should be :)", "It\u2019s so bizarre!

While *anybody* is in the room?! If they wanted to have sex during the trip they should have gotten separate rooms or just not invited you.\n\nThis is off putting and I would tell them to not contact you again until they learned basic boundaries.", "They are being gross. We shared a room with my 10yr old son and 6yr old daughter for 3nights and kept off each other. It\u2019s not rocket science.

That's how a public conversation works. \n\nI recommend learning the discourse skill of omitting irrelevant information to avoid confusing your actual point.", "Current society norms are the crux of the majority of ethical discussion. It's not a useful thing to do to make today's decisions based on the social customs of 150 years ago.

I think not...", "it's one I really, really hope was fake because there is not enough time in the OP's life to work through that one.", "Obviously fucked up stuff like that does happen in real life, but I read all of the posts and comments and it really seemed fake to me. It read like it was lifted from a kink story on literotica or something. (That's what I really hope, anyway.)", "NTA - How could anyone, let alone parents, think this kind of behavior was okay? It's disgusting and seems like parental pornography which I don't think anyone is into at all.", "Ugh \ud83d\ude29. NTA.  So creepy that they wouldn\u2019t even TRY to keep it down!", "NTA \n\n I would never ever travel sharing a room with them again. But if somehow it was unavoidable and they decided to have sexy time again while you were like 8' away, start cheering and clapping! Yeah,  give it to her good! Harder! Faster!

They stopped after the third night when I asked loudly if I could join.", "NTA- Your parents are a couple of creeps.

I doubt it.. honestly when your together that long(considering they\u2019ve been together for as long as op has been alive) I can\u2019t fathom feeling the NEED to fuck next to your sleeping kid.. sad and disgusting", "This is so disgusting that it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s real. If this is real, your parents are deeply sick and you should go no contact with them. NTA", "NTA\n\nI can understand your point of view.  No one wants to see or hear their parents having sex.

Maybe waiting until they were asleep.  I live in the western United States and many Native American families lived in one teepee.  Whites that ran them off their lands, usually built a 12 foot by 12 foot house, which may have a curtain for the parents bedroom or not.  Kids slept on the floor or sometimes there was an open loft for the kids.  They couldn't wait until morning when the kids might be outside because outside chores had to be done when it was light out."]}
