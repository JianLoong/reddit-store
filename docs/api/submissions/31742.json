You were not being callous.\n\nLook, there are ways to do things. Your Dad inviting Annie to Thanksgiving instead of you two meeting for the first time at a Starbucks or something is pretty bold and suggests he's a bit out of touch.\n\nTo you, she is a stranger. Why would you have emotion attached to someone who you don't know, who invited themselves into your life and is now trying to tell you how you are supposed to feel?\n\nAnnie wants to jump from 0 - 60 without hitting 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50... and you can't do that. That is now how people work. She's had YEARS to regret walking away and years to imagine what this homecoming would look like. You had no idea who she was as a person, no desire for her to be part of your life and you needed to be convinced to even meet her. \n\nNow you've met her. Its up to you whether or not you wish to see her again but it is absolutely okay for you to sit down with your Dad and tell her that you didn't like her coming into your space. She is a stranger to you. You'd like to take this in bite size chunks of very limited duration meetings while you decide if it is worth investing in a relationship with her.", "NTA.\n\nAnnie *IS* a stranger. She made that choice 15 years ago. It is only because of *YOUR* grace that she got to meet with you at all.\n\nSeriously, you asked her a legitimate question as a response to a fairly entitled comment on her part. If I were in your position, I think I would have asked the exact same thing of her. \n\nI think you were plenty empathetic to her while still respecting your own feelings. You didn\u2019t laugh in her face or fly into a rage (well, I\u2019m assuming you did not). \n\nYou seemed to have handled the situation pretty well.", "NTA - idk why it's an expectation that bio parents and children would have some magical connection. A lot of the emotional attachment between parents and children happens due to bonding and nurturing. You've lived 15 years without her, you are old enough to understand her rejection and absence, as opposed to a younger child who may not be aware of that in the same way. I don't have a problem with Annie's initial choices, she wasn't ready to be a parent. But it's her job now to build an emotional connection if she wants one, not her entitled right. And it's not your responsibility to carry the emotional burden of that relationship. She's the adult, she needs to figure it out, if she wants to be parental that's how parenting works.", "NTA.  That was an honest question.  Did she expect you to slobber all over her, calling her mommy?  Begging to be back in her life? Was she upset that you are a well adjusted young woman who is doing great without her?  Her statement to you is a reflection of how she is feeling.  Don't let her put that on you.\n\nNot sure what your dad meant by that was callous.  He gave you the option of pulling back so feel free to do that if that is how you feel.\n\nYou handled things very well, you are going to be alright. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. Seriously, what the hell did she expect? That\u2019s literally what she\u2019s been all your life. You\u2019re fine, and your dad is navigating unfamiliar territory, so don\u2019t expect him to know the best things to say. As far as the egg-donor is concerned, you are absolutely NOT obligated to let her into your life. She chose\u2026something? over her child. It\u2019s all up to you if you want to connect with her.", "NTA. She is a stranger.", "NTA cause wtf did she expect? I literally can't imagine another realistic outcome.

You've never met this woman. If she can't accept that it's going to take you a lot of time to get used to this change, then she shouldn't have reached out. \n\nHonestly, be wary. Why is she reaching out now? What changed?", "Birth mom got what she deserved.  A meal and intro to her estranged child she birthed and signed away custody rights.

She deserves your respect. Annie doesn't.", "NTA  Tell dad, courage is what he showed by not giving up on you. Courage is what your stepmom displayed by taking on a child of another woman but treating as her own.\n\nWhat bio-mom did has selfish connotations, she didn't do it for you, she did for herself. If she was doing it for you she would have done it long before you became a young adult.", "NTA. Your response could be callous of you were older but you\u2019re a kid still. Besides, you have a good point, you are strangers. Of course you\u2019re not gonna jump into treating her like a mother.", "People change and learn from experience.  Your bio mother was only 3 years older then you are now and likely have changed her world views wildly.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have expected more and your dad probably thinks having a relationship with her may be useful (he may or may not be right).", "Now, there is also the fact that she has your home address.

Go see a movie together? \n\nGuess not, because she wasn\u2019t the one who raised you, it was Madison. Annie\u2019s literally just a stranger who happened to give birth to you.

He should have defended you.\n\nPerhaps he was clinging to a fantasy that things would go wonderfully and it would be love at first sight.

You can have an honest talk with your dad about this.  Maybe tell him that you want him on your side and ask him how does he think you should have responded? It can't hurt to hear his side and it might make him THINK because right now he isn't thinking about how unfair that question was to you. I've had a parent like your mom.  They think if they try once they deserve everything...that's not how this works.  They have messed up by missing thousands of opportunities and left you alone thousands of times.  One meal doesn't make a relationship.  This isn't a Hallmark movie. A parent child relationship isn't Just Add Food and Three Hours..  Ask him what he wants you to learn from this and why isn't the lesson setting boundaries and having them respected. \n\nand here is another question to ask your dad.  Did he ask your bio mom why now? and did she just start dating someone?  Because all the times my bio dad reached out to me were times when his SO thought he should...so he did it to please her.  \nAlso ask him if he has thought about what will happen when she takes off again.

You are a 15 yo who responded directly to a question by a stranger. Sure, you could have worded it different, but why? Kindof the same situation here, but I am the grandma and have raised my eldest grandson. My son and his ex were young when they had him, and chose to continue to be young and dumb. Eventually my son straightened up, married and has more children. His ex moved in with a registered child molestor, and as neither had any visitation rights to start, I told her she was welcome to visit with him, but the boyfriend was not. She chose not to visit, ended up losing all contact, and I terminated her rights. Recently she popped back up when he was 15, and I told her I was against it, but I would ask him if he wanted to see her. He said he would meet with her, and I told her straight forward that it was going to be awkward, that she has had this \"idea\" of her love for him, and that she is a complete stranger to him. We met in a public place, along with her other children and well, it was awkward. She contacted him a few more times after that, got his hopes up, and ghosted him. (as I figured she would) But my job as a parent, was to give him the opportunity to make the decision for himself, and to support him in however that turned out. (He does not know the details of the crap she put him through in his early years, he only remembers she bought him a dinosaur one time)", "NTA, Her question was oblivious as hell and also kinda rude.  What did she expect.  Seriously many people need to learn that atoning for mistakes is all well and fine, but no one is obligated to jump from years of lived experience because they feel bad.", "NTA. It's the first time you see her, right? So she basically is a stranger to you.", "NTA, your question was valid. What did she expect a 15yo who'd never met her to do?", "NTA\n\nWhat indeed did she expect? She is a stranger. She was treated accordingly. She is not entitled to call herself your mother. And it seems you have one of those now in Maddison. \n\nIt is entirely up to you how to interact with Annie and indeed if you interact with Annie. I would also suggest a more neutral location for any future meetings. Not your home and safe space.", "NTA Inviting a person that *is* a stranger to OP to a major family dinner was an odd choice. Maybe dad thought if things got out of hand, he'd have help kicking her out? Or thought he could make things less awkward somehow? Make it feel more like bio-mom was family? Idk what the logic there was. \n\n\nOP sounds like she was being polite to a guest, which is what bio-mom was. Bio-mom might have been expecting a warmer reception, especially because she was invited to a meal traditionally for family. But she was an AH to get pissy she wasn't welcomed with hugs and kisses after giving up her daughter. And Dad was nearly as bad for chiding OP about not being friendlier with the woman. You are right in that only OP and Madison are acting like reasonable people here.", "If dad agreed to mom signing rights away, judge would let it happen. Signing rights away also means no child support.", "OP's father is behaving irrationally during this whole affair. I frankly think it was incredibly selfish of him to even create this situation; he pressured his teenage girlfriend to have a child she didn't want, which was in turned raised by himself, another teenager, and grandparents, knowing her mother abandoned her. Annie is also to blame for this, if you don't want kids, you shouldn't be birthing them and then abandoning them. Then 15 years later Annie comes back and asks to reconnect with her child and her father, which sounds fishy to me: wanting to have a relationship with your biological child is natural, but I doubt many people get the urge to seek out their college sweetheart after a decade and a half. I wonder if she just wanted to know OP and the father interpreted it as an interest in him too. Anyway, the father, instead of prioritizing his child, seems more focused on being fair to Annie, to a completely unreasonable degree, against his current wife's objections. Inviting her to a family celebration as a first step? Telling his daughter off for not immediately accepting her as a parent?\n\nI am going to speculate wildly now: I wonder if, for the father, Annie is the one who got away (and whether that factored into his decision to have the child, maybe hoping she would change her mind once the baby was born) and he is playing out some fantasy that their \"real\" family is going to come together at last.", "Agree, NTA. I wonder if she has hit her 30s and doesn\u2019t have a stable relationship or children and just decided to go find her bio kid and ex-boyfriend like they are just a ready made family she can pick up whenever she wants.

Annie to you is just a stranger.", "Sounds like you have an amazing mom named Madison. Annie can go pound sand. I\u2019m a bit confused by your father\u2019s actions in this, saying it\u2019s fine for her to try reconnecting with you as long as that\u2019s what YOU want, then switches gears by inviting her to a family holiday dinner and saying you were callous when asking Annie what she expected. I hope he gets his head out of his butt soon.", "ur father needs to pull his head out of his ass and protect his kid wtf??", "NTA Tell your dad \"What did you expect when you invited a stranger to a family event and determined for me how ***I*** first got to interact with the woman who abandoned ***me***? How TF did you think any of that was a good idea? Seriously, Dad. Do better. The fact she thinks I owe her *anything at all* much less emoting closeness or any other predetermined emotion she thinks I should have says a lot about why even meeting her was a bad idea and what sort of person she is.\"", "Your response was callous? That's bullshit. That woman (who shall not be named) is only biologically your mom. That's it, she gave that up when she decided she didn't want anything to do with you. Now it's time for you to repay her by doing the same to her.\n\nHopefully your dad doesn't try to force her on you by inviting her over to the house anymore or by trying to get you to see her.", "NTA.\n\nBut curious what has Annie been up to for the 15 years ?", "NTA.\n\nShe's a complete stranger, someone you've never met, know nothing about, and have developed no relationship with. Why would you treat her like anything other than a stranger? Your dad knows who she is, but you've never so much as laid eyes on her your whole life, so there's nothing to have an emotional relationship with. Not even a Christmas card or a picture. So of course you'd treat her like a stranger, because that's literally what she is.", "NTA!\n\nOf course she is like a stranger to you.\n\nShe shouldn't have expected anything as there was nothing to expect.\n\nMaybe she is single, alone and searches for someone to connect with.", "This is the first time you\u2019ve met her. She\u2019s the literal definition of a stranger\u2026..so NTA. As someone who didn\u2019t learn about a bio parent who had no part in raising me until the age of 11 I have to say I not only disagree with your father but I\u2019m godsmacked your bio mother would say that. It doesn\u2019t sound like she has the emotional maturity to recognize she gave you up and isn\u2019t owed anything. Your feelings are valid as is your choice of whether you want her in your life.", "NTA. She made the decision to not be in your life. It might be admirable that she has grown and now wants to know you but she can't pretend like she hasnt been missing for 13 years.", "You\u2019ve treated me like a stranger my whole life so you ARE a stranger", "NTA. Annie is a stranger.   \n\n\nMaybe some day she might not be. But for now she is. I agree with you that this might have been done better at a neutral place, or at least without the added pressures of a holiday meal.", "Agreed. I will never understand these ones, with the young parent taking off and coming back much later. Then expecting everything to just fall into place because the \"parent\" is in a position where they want to be a part of the child's life.\n\nYeah, being young is an explanation, not an excuse. Annie's in a position where she wants to be in OP's life now? Cool, doesn't mean OP is obligated to let her, just like Annie apparently wasn't obligated to give two shits about OP.\n\nAnd a special AH mention for Dad here, who is destroying his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e and kid for his deadbeat ex.", "Has Dad got one of those \u201chaving your bio parents in your life is the best possible option\u201d mindsets? Like \u201ca girl should have her mother\u201d? Despite knowing what the bio-Mom is like/has done, and seeing that OP *has* a mother figure already.  \n\nHe wants bio-Mom in OP\u2019s life because of a foolish misconception. He needs to stay in his lane and stop trying to force OP to have a relationship they don\u2019t want. He\u2019s lucky the Thanksgiving day meal went relatively well, until the very end. It *was* wildly inappropriate and could\u2019ve been an absolute trainwreck.", "Probably.\nShe most likely thought the dad would also be waiting for her.\nNow she\u2019s coming to terms that op and her dad have moved on from her a long time ago", "Sounds like Annie thought OP spent 15 years pining for her, but OP didn't miss something they never had. Now Madison has shown them the care a mother can have for their child OP isn't missing anything.", ">Despite knowing what the bio-Mom is like/has done, and seeing that OP has a mother figure already. \n\nBio mum hadn't previously done anything wrong. In fact, she went above and beyond by going through pregnancy and childbirth because OP's dad wanted the baby - she didn't want one and was within her rights to have an abortion.\n\nNo, she can't expect to immediately have a mother/daughter relationship, but she didn't start the story as a villain.", "It's not abandonment. She relinquished the child at birth like many bio parents of adopted kids have done.\n\nAbandonment implies some sort of betrayal or neglected responsibilities, which Annie never agreed to take on in the first place.", "She's still been a better mother to OP than Annie has.", "I do lack empathy for the bio mother. I think because her approach\nshows a lack of empathy toward OP. I have an issue with the way she just showed up and criticised OP (only hours after meeting them) for not treating her how she wanted. She has never been a mother to OP, her view of how a child should treat a parent they have never been around is based on her fantasy not reality. OP is a person she has to build a relationship with not a possession she can just claim. The bio mother didn\u2019t say sorry for her absence or ask OP what type of relationship they are open to. That is entitled to me. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t have a relationship but I think the bio mother needs to do some self-reflection and be more humble in her approach.", "You don\u2019t understand what signing away parental rights are do you?  \n\nSigning away ones parental rights is to stand in front of a judge and sign away all legal connections to said child.  You have no authority over them and they are no longer legally your child. That includes child support.  \n\nThere may be a few states that separate child support but I have never heard of it. \n\n[Pennsylvania Law](https://www.pafamilylawllc.com/termination-of-parental-rights). Is pretty clear that when rights are terminated so to is child support.", "Bio mum didn't actually demand to be treated as a mother - just expressed surprise/disappointment at being treated like a stranger. There's a vast middle ground between the two options.", "I\u2019m surprised at bio mum being surprised. She is a stranger to OP. OP had never met her before and knew that she had signed her rights away. \n\nBio mom may not have demanded to be treated as a mother but she did expect it. OP said  \u201cIt was silent before Annie broke it by complaining that I treated her like a stranger rather than my mother\u201d. \n\nHonestly, I hope OP can have a relationship with their bio mom that feels right for them, whatever that is.", ">Actually, the only reason the dinner happened was because Annie wanted contact\n\nAnnie wanting contact doesn't magically make a Thanksgiving invitation happen. The dad not only was open for it, but he *pushed* for it. He had to convince his wife to allow it. And even then, it's weird to invite someone who's a stranger to everyone but him to a family holiday event.\n\n>Personally, I think having the meeting at home was a great idea - because it is home territory \n\nLiterally every piece of advice about meeting people says to meet at neutral location. You don't invite people you're just meeting into your home. This is literally like the first rule of negotiation.\n\nIf anyone is projecting here, it seems like you. You sound like you've been in the dad's position here and made the wrong choice at some point.", "Children don\u2019t ask to be born and have no obligation to be thankful for it.", "According to what OP's dad says. We don't actually have Annie's side of the story, whatever it is.", "No kids, no wife.   But, I'm adopted, so, unlike you, I understand the overall picture far better than you.  Further -  I agree with the OP, bio-Mom is nothing, end of issue.  So, no, my bio-mom is the one who may or may not have regrets.\n\nBut, again, that comment says more about you than anything.  You really want this to be the Dad's fault, and it's not.   He said nothing over the line after, either.  \n\nDating advice says that, but - this isn't a single woman going off to a strange spot alone, there's no danger here.  The first rule is negotiate from a position of power - high ground, home field, whatever.  \n\nBeen to plenty of Thanksgiving dinners where there were guest that only one person knew.  Been that guest, too.   \n\nYou just want high octane drama."]}
