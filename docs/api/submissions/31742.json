You were not being callous.\n\nLook, there are ways to do things. Your Dad inviting Annie to Thanksgiving instead of you two meeting for the first time at a Starbucks or something is pretty bold and suggests he's a bit out of touch.\n\nTo you, she is a stranger. Why would you have emotion attached to someone who you don't know, who invited themselves into your life and is now trying to tell you how you are supposed to feel?\n\nAnnie wants to jump from 0 - 60 without hitting 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50... and you can't do that. That is now how people work. She's had YEARS to regret walking away and years to imagine what this homecoming would look like. You had no idea who she was as a person, no desire for her to be part of your life and you needed to be convinced to even meet her. \n\nNow you've met her. Its up to you whether or not you wish to see her again but it is absolutely okay for you to sit down with your Dad and tell her that you didn't like her coming into your space. She is a stranger to you. You'd like to take this in bite size chunks of very limited duration meetings while you decide if it is worth investing in a relationship with her.", "NTA.\n\nAnnie *IS* a stranger. She made that choice 15 years ago. It is only because of *YOUR* grace that she got to meet with you at all.\n\nSeriously, you asked her a legitimate question as a response to a fairly entitled comment on her part. If I were in your position, I think I would have asked the exact same thing of her. \n\nI think you were plenty empathetic to her while still respecting your own feelings. You didn\u2019t laugh in her face or fly into a rage (well, I\u2019m assuming you did not). \n\nYou seemed to have handled the situation pretty well.", "NTA - idk why it's an expectation that bio parents and children would have some magical connection. A lot of the emotional attachment between parents and children happens due to bonding and nurturing. You've lived 15 years without her, you are old enough to understand her rejection and absence, as opposed to a younger child who may not be aware of that in the same way. I don't have a problem with Annie's initial choices, she wasn't ready to be a parent. But it's her job now to build an emotional connection if she wants one, not her entitled right. And it's not your responsibility to carry the emotional burden of that relationship. She's the adult, she needs to figure it out, if she wants to be parental that's how parenting works.", "NTA.  That was an honest question.  Did she expect you to slobber all over her, calling her mommy?  Begging to be back in her life? Was she upset that you are a well adjusted young woman who is doing great without her?  Her statement to you is a reflection of how she is feeling.  Don't let her put that on you.\n\nNot sure what your dad meant by that was callous.  He gave you the option of pulling back so feel free to do that if that is how you feel.\n\nYou handled things very well, you are going to be alright. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. Seriously, what the hell did she expect? That\u2019s literally what she\u2019s been all your life. You\u2019re fine, and your dad is navigating unfamiliar territory, so don\u2019t expect him to know the best things to say. As far as the egg-donor is concerned, you are absolutely NOT obligated to let her into your life. She chose\u2026something? over her child. It\u2019s all up to you if you want to connect with her.", "NTA. She is a stranger.", "NTA cause wtf did she expect? I literally can't imagine another realistic outcome.

You've never met this woman. If she can't accept that it's going to take you a lot of time to get used to this change, then she shouldn't have reached out. \n\nHonestly, be wary. Why is she reaching out now? What changed?", "Birth mom got what she deserved.  A meal and intro to her estranged child she birthed and signed away custody rights.

She deserves your respect. Annie doesn't.", "NTA  Tell dad, courage is what he showed by not giving up on you. Courage is what your stepmom displayed by taking on a child of another woman but treating as her own.\n\nWhat bio-mom did has selfish connotations, she didn't do it for you, she did for herself. If she was doing it for you she would have done it long before you became a young adult.", "NTA. Your response could be callous of you were older but you\u2019re a kid still. Besides, you have a good point, you are strangers. Of course you\u2019re not gonna jump into treating her like a mother.", "People change and learn from experience.  Your bio mother was only 3 years older then you are now and likely have changed her world views wildly.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have expected more and your dad probably thinks having a relationship with her may be useful (he may or may not be right).", "Now, there is also the fact that she has your home address.

Go see a movie together? \n\nGuess not, because she wasn\u2019t the one who raised you, it was Madison. Annie\u2019s literally just a stranger who happened to give birth to you.

He should have defended you.\n\nPerhaps he was clinging to a fantasy that things would go wonderfully and it would be love at first sight.

You can have an honest talk with your dad about this.  Maybe tell him that you want him on your side and ask him how does he think you should have responded? It can't hurt to hear his side and it might make him THINK because right now he isn't thinking about how unfair that question was to you. I've had a parent like your mom.  They think if they try once they deserve everything...that's not how this works.  They have messed up by missing thousands of opportunities and left you alone thousands of times.  One meal doesn't make a relationship.  This isn't a Hallmark movie. A parent child relationship isn't Just Add Food and Three Hours..  Ask him what he wants you to learn from this and why isn't the lesson setting boundaries and having them respected. \n\nand here is another question to ask your dad.  Did he ask your bio mom why now? and did she just start dating someone?  Because all the times my bio dad reached out to me were times when his SO thought he should...so he did it to please her.  \nAlso ask him if he has thought about what will happen when she takes off again.

You are a 15 yo who responded directly to a question by a stranger. Sure, you could have worded it different, but why? Kindof the same situation here, but I am the grandma and have raised my eldest grandson. My son and his ex were young when they had him, and chose to continue to be young and dumb. Eventually my son straightened up, married and has more children. His ex moved in with a registered child molestor, and as neither had any visitation rights to start, I told her she was welcome to visit with him, but the boyfriend was not. She chose not to visit, ended up losing all contact, and I terminated her rights. Recently she popped back up when he was 15, and I told her I was against it, but I would ask him if he wanted to see her. He said he would meet with her, and I told her straight forward that it was going to be awkward, that she has had this \"idea\" of her love for him, and that she is a complete stranger to him. We met in a public place, along with her other children and well, it was awkward. She contacted him a few more times after that, got his hopes up, and ghosted him. (as I figured she would) But my job as a parent, was to give him the opportunity to make the decision for himself, and to support him in however that turned out. (He does not know the details of the crap she put him through in his early years, he only remembers she bought him a dinosaur one time)", "NTA, Her question was oblivious as hell and also kinda rude.  What did she expect.  Seriously many people need to learn that atoning for mistakes is all well and fine, but no one is obligated to jump from years of lived experience because they feel bad.", "NTA. It's the first time you see her, right? So she basically is a stranger to you.", "NTA, your question was valid. What did she expect a 15yo who'd never met her to do?", "NTA\n\nWhat indeed did she expect? She is a stranger. She was treated accordingly. She is not entitled to call herself your mother. And it seems you have one of those now in Maddison. \n\nIt is entirely up to you how to interact with Annie and indeed if you interact with Annie. I would also suggest a more neutral location for any future meetings. Not your home and safe space.", "NTA Inviting a person that *is* a stranger to OP to a major family dinner was an odd choice. Maybe dad thought if things got out of hand, he'd have help kicking her out? Or thought he could make things less awkward somehow? Make it feel more like bio-mom was family? Idk what the logic there was. \n\n\nOP sounds like she was being polite to a guest, which is what bio-mom was. Bio-mom might have been expecting a warmer reception, especially because she was invited to a meal traditionally for family. But she was an AH to get pissy she wasn't welcomed with hugs and kisses after giving up her daughter. And Dad was nearly as bad for chiding OP about not being friendlier with the woman. You are right in that only OP and Madison are acting like reasonable people here.", "If dad agreed to mom signing rights away, judge would let it happen. Signing rights away also means no child support.", "OP's father is behaving irrationally during this whole affair. I frankly think it was incredibly selfish of him to even create this situation; he pressured his teenage girlfriend to have a child she didn't want, which was in turned raised by himself, another teenager, and grandparents, knowing her mother abandoned her. Annie is also to blame for this, if you don't want kids, you shouldn't be birthing them and then abandoning them. Then 15 years later Annie comes back and asks to reconnect with her child and her father, which sounds fishy to me: wanting to have a relationship with your biological child is natural, but I doubt many people get the urge to seek out their college sweetheart after a decade and a half. I wonder if she just wanted to know OP and the father interpreted it as an interest in him too. Anyway, the father, instead of prioritizing his child, seems more focused on being fair to Annie, to a completely unreasonable degree, against his current wife's objections. Inviting her to a family celebration as a first step? Telling his daughter off for not immediately accepting her as a parent?\n\nI am going to speculate wildly now: I wonder if, for the father, Annie is the one who got away (and whether that factored into his decision to have the child, maybe hoping she would change her mind once the baby was born) and he is playing out some fantasy that their \"real\" family is going to come together at last.", "Agree, NTA. I wonder if she has hit her 30s and doesn\u2019t have a stable relationship or children and just decided to go find her bio kid and ex-boyfriend like they are just a ready made family she can pick up whenever she wants. Seems super entitled and delusional.", "Absolutely this. I'm adopted and my Mum is the person who has cared for me. My biological mother is a stranger. I'd feel the same way OP did.", "In this case Annie needs a psychiatric treatment asap", "Thanks for remembering I exist now that I have no use for you and have a mom of my own. I don\u2019t need you to teach me anything as I\u2019ve practically lived my entire childhood already so why did you bother showing up now?", "Realistically, a parent who was absent till their child being almost grow  up is never going to get to 60; at least not the 60 of parent who raised you. It can happen, but they are much more likely to end up with a relationship resembling that of a stepparent that came into your life at 15, or a uncle/aunt you are very close to.", "the truth ? she don\u2019t know that lady.", "Eh, she very well may be a bad person. Who snaps at a child for not fawning over them?", "Not in the United States.  Signing away your parental *rights* does not negate your parental *responsibilities*.  Separate issues. Otherwise, every deadbeat parent in the country would just \u2018sign away their rights\u2019 and skip paying child support.", "Nope. Parental rights are what the parent has. Parental responsibility is what the parent owes the child or the child's rights. They are legally different things, and child support falls under parental responsibility. You can sign away your own rights (custody, visitation, ect.) but you can not sign away the child's rights. The only ways I know to get out of parental responsibility is for the state to revoke it or if the child becomes legally no longer yours, such as if they are adopted.\n\n\n ETA: OP dad could go after bio-mom for back child support if she hasn't been paying.", "No it doesn\u2019t. That would impact children\u2019s rights and a parent can\u2019t sign those away", "But it also means 0 relationship with the kid so op NTA , Madison either and your father is a huge AH.\n\nTell him to never invite Annie in your home ,ever.\n\nAnd tell him to open his eyes she's just the 'incubator' practically and as such NOT YOUR MOTHER. He is your dad she's no one especially after signing her rights away", "I mean, if we're doing speculation, he also could be feeling some level of guilt for how he views his role in the whole thing, even though so much of that was really Annie's decisions and him respecting them.", "Maybe something has happened medically and she can no longer have kids and thought I know, I\u2019ll dig up the one I threw away 15 years ago, ding ready made family.\n\nEither way she abandoned you for 15 years, spending a few hours with you isn\u2019t going to magically make an emotional bond form. Also your dad arranging this for a time specifically for family is a bit strange if I\u2019m honest. First meetings like this should best be done somewhere other than your safe zone so that it doesn\u2019t compromise where you feel able to fall back to if it doesn\u2019t go well.\n\nYes it must have taken a lot of courage for your egg donor to suddenly rock up after 15 years of zero contribution but this isn\u2019t something to be applauded or anything. It also took a lot of courage on your part to meet someone that had no doubt caused emotional issues to you. They both need to understand Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day and if they try and force things too fast it will crumble around them.", "Are you condoning rudeness to rude people?\n\nThat's not the same as denying rudeness", "That's why it involves mutual consent. It can be done.", "It's pretty normal for people who surrendered kids for adoption to later seek them out, which is basically what Annie's doing. You're both looking for an ulterior motive which probably doesn't even exist.", "Yes but someone who is seeking out a child after surrendering them has to expect that the child is going to be guarded/antagonistic towards them for their feelings of abandonment. OP isn\u2019t a small child where everything is kittens and rainbows anymore, she\u2019s almost an adult and has formed her own identity and egg donor can\u2019t just expect to go hi and integrate into her life. If things were this easy then family therapists wouldn\u2019t exist."]}
