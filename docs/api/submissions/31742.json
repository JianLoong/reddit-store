It was unplanned, but my dad wanted to keep me but my bio mom \"Annie\" didn't, so they made a compromise where Annie didn't abort me and would instead sign away all of her rights to my dad who would have full custody.\n\nAnnie and my dad didn't really speak for the rest of the time at college, and Annie requested that my dad not contact her since she was moving from their hometown.  My grandparents were the main people helping out my dad as I grew up, and my dad told me what happened when I was thirteen after I asked about it, because he started dating my soon-to-be stepmom, Madison.\n\nI resented Annie a little bit for not being around before realizing it was better to not have her in my life since she didn't want me. Besides, if she was still around, my dad might've not met his fiance who I consider my mom already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, Annie has reached out to my dad about reconnecting with him and me. My dad shot down the reconnecting with him part, because of Maddison but he was open to letting her reconnect with me as long as I wanted to know her.\n\nMadison was not open to this and thought Annie would just hurt me, but my dad convinced her that we could cut her back out of our lives since she didn't have any rights anyway.  After a long talk, I agreed to meet her out of curiosity about what she's been up to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor some reason, my dad decided to invite Annie to our Thanksgiving dinner rather than schedule a meeting at Red Lobster or something.  I thought it was strange, but didn't say anything.  \n\nIt was a bit awkward at first, but we eventually started talking more freely during dinner. I did dodge some more personal questions, but I thought it was a good conversation overall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter my grandparents left, Annie was still there and we started to load the food into the fridge. Annie offered to help so my dad and Madison let her get the food into tupperware containers alongside me.\n\nIt was silent before Annie broke it by complaining that I treated her like a stranger rather than my mother and that I wasn't very emotional.  I was kinda stunned by the \"treating her like a stranger\" part, and I only asked what did she expect.\n\nAnnie looked like she was going to protest or something before my dad said it was best that she get home since it was getting dark, and we'd finished cleaning up by ourselves.  Annie left, and we finished cleaning up.\n\nMy dad stopped me before I went to my bedroom, and said that my response was kinda callous and that I should more empathetic to Annie because it must've taken a lot of courage for her to reach out.  \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1700969068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1841dgw/aita_for_asking_my_bio_mom_what_she_expected/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's fucking delusional. \n\nAlso, very inappropriate to invite her to a holiday dinner. If it was your request that's one thing. But this was seemingly your time to get to get to know her and it pretty much only made things worse. \n\nYour dad should have used his head and not invited her over for Thanksgiving. I find that wildly inappropriate after what she did and the fact she hasn't been in your life. \n\nAlso, you can't just sign a piece of paper that gives up your rights as a parent without a judge signing off on it. She should have been helping with child support your whole life unless your dad is rich. \n\nYou and Madison are the only people here not acting like complete idiots.", "NTA. Just because someone gave birth to you, does not make them a mother. You didn't bond as a mother/daughter after your birth. You have no memory of that woman, she is a total stranger to you. What did she and your father expect, that you'd run into her arms and cry \"mommy\"?", "NTA\n\nYour question was honest, and it sounds like it didn't come from a place of malice but out of genuine surprise.\n\nBecause what did she expect? She is a stranger. She made the choice to not be your mother 15 years ago, even signing away her parental rights.\n\nYou still haven't even found out why she reached out, so it may not have taken any courage at all.", " Annie has most likely fantasized about this meeting for a long time, she was perhaps expecting your reaction to her to be of a 5 year old and not a 15 year old.  \n\nOne skill of an emotionally mature person is to be able to accept the world as it is.  Annie wanted a different reaction from you and was annoyed enough to point it out.  Not a good sign.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're 15, not 5. Annie has been gone with zero contact for the past 15 years so of course you're not super emotional and treating her like a stranger. Besides, you clearly already have a mom who's Madison.", "What DID she expect exactly?\n\nYou to throw yourself into her arms and say \"hey mommy, I'm so glad you finally want me now that I can take care of myself and you don't have to\"?\n\nShe can gtfoh\n\nNTA\n\nAnnie is delusional, and should probably go back to college?  Out of town?  Whatever sand she had her head stuck in to think that you would actually treat her like family when she LITERALLY is a stranger, and you met her TODAY?", "NTA. I think she kind of put you on the spot and you were honest in your feelings. She is a stranger.", "NTA.  You sound like you have more emotional awareness than Annie and your Dad combined.  She IS a stranger to you, you have never known her to build any emotional connection.  Meeting at a restaurant or park would have been a much better idea than thanksgiving which is traditionally a family event.  She has never been a part of your family.  It might have taken courage for her to reach out, but it took courage from you to agree to meet her as well.", "Your dad is wrong on this. Your feelings are always okay and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. Annie is a stranger. Other than birthing you, she is nothing to you or your life. If you don\u2019t feel the need to see her anymore, don\u2019t. But please ask your dad to respect you and your feelings. NTA", "NTA: why is she surprised you treat her like a stranger when she literally is a stranger? I would react the same way as you considering i also have a bio mother that i have never met. i get what your dad means considering it must be difficult to reach out to your child who you haven't interacted with but i don't think you are an asshole for how you responded.", "NTA, heck, it would have been NTA if you decided not to meet her at all.  Your bio-mom can't expect to catch up on 15 years of non-contact in one night, and she and your dad need to respect that you were going through a lot of emotions at the time", "NTA, imagine her thinking that how she felt was the important take away from her meeting the child she  abandoned.", "NTA- the lady sounds entitled and clueless. She made her choices its not your job to make her feel great about it. She literally is a stranger I mean you wouldn\u2019t have recognized her walking down the street.

You were not being callous.\n\nLook, there are ways to do things. Your Dad inviting Annie to Thanksgiving instead of you two meeting for the first time at a Starbucks or something is pretty bold and suggests he's a bit out of touch.\n\nTo you, she is a stranger. Why would you have emotion attached to someone who you don't know, who invited themselves into your life and is now trying to tell you how you are supposed to feel?\n\nAnnie wants to jump from 0 - 60 without hitting 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50... and you can't do that. That is now how people work. She's had YEARS to regret walking away and years to imagine what this homecoming would look like. You had no idea who she was as a person, no desire for her to be part of your life and you needed to be convinced to even meet her. \n\nNow you've met her. Its up to you whether or not you wish to see her again but it is absolutely okay for you to sit down with your Dad and tell her that you didn't like her coming into your space. She is a stranger to you. You'd like to take this in bite size chunks of very limited duration meetings while you decide if it is worth investing in a relationship with her.", "NTA.\n\nAnnie *IS* a stranger. She made that choice 15 years ago. It is only because of *YOUR* grace that she got to meet with you at all.\n\nSeriously, you asked her a legitimate question as a response to a fairly entitled comment on her part. If I were in your position, I think I would have asked the exact same thing of her. \n\nI think you were plenty empathetic to her while still respecting your own feelings. You didn\u2019t laugh in her face or fly into a rage (well, I\u2019m assuming you did not). \n\nYou seemed to have handled the situation pretty well.", "NTA - idk why it's an expectation that bio parents and children would have some magical connection. A lot of the emotional attachment between parents and children happens due to bonding and nurturing. You've lived 15 years without her, you are old enough to understand her rejection and absence, as opposed to a younger child who may not be aware of that in the same way. I don't have a problem with Annie's initial choices, she wasn't ready to be a parent. But it's her job now to build an emotional connection if she wants one, not her entitled right. And it's not your responsibility to carry the emotional burden of that relationship. She's the adult, she needs to figure it out, if she wants to be parental that's how parenting works.", "NTA.  That was an honest question.  Did she expect you to slobber all over her, calling her mommy?  Begging to be back in her life? Was she upset that you are a well adjusted young woman who is doing great without her?  Her statement to you is a reflection of how she is feeling.  Don't let her put that on you.\n\nNot sure what your dad meant by that was callous.  He gave you the option of pulling back so feel free to do that if that is how you feel.\n\nYou handled things very well, you are going to be alright. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. Seriously, what the hell did she expect? That\u2019s literally what she\u2019s been all your life. You\u2019re fine, and your dad is navigating unfamiliar territory, so don\u2019t expect him to know the best things to say. As far as the egg-donor is concerned, you are absolutely NOT obligated to let her into your life. She chose\u2026something? over her child. It\u2019s all up to you if you want to connect with her.", "NTA. She is a stranger.", "NTA cause wtf did she expect? I literally can't imagine another realistic outcome. Were you supposed to run into her arms yelling \"mom\" and crying tears of joy or something? Why? She has done nothing for you. She should consider herself lucky you gave her a chance", "NTA. \n\nWhat *did* she expect?", "Of course Nta", "A lot of comments have already been said about your mom, so I will focus on your dad. He is being an fool in this situation. \n\nNot meeting in a public place. \nDisregarding your feelings. \n\nHe needs to get his sht right. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou're 100% right. She is a stranger. You've never met this woman. If she can't accept that it's going to take you a lot of time to get used to this change, then she shouldn't have reached out. \n\nHonestly, be wary. Why is she reaching out now? What changed?", "Birth mom got what she deserved.  A meal and intro to her estranged child she birthed and signed away custody rights.  She doesn\u2019t get to pick her reaction or responses- just the ability to be introduced and figure out where things go from there.", "NTA I would have told her that she is a stranger and that Maddison is my mother", "NTA\n\nShe is a stranger, and entitled. She left you behind to have her fun, and now, over a decade later, she's showing up expecting to be close to you. You owe her nothing. The only thing she did for you was not killing you as an infant, which is bare minimum parenting. Madison, on the other hand, has always been there for you and cares deeply about your well-being. She deserves your respect. Annie doesn't.", "NTA  Tell dad, courage is what he showed by not giving up on you. Courage is what your stepmom displayed by taking on a child of another woman but treating as her own.\n\nWhat bio-mom did has selfish connotations, she didn't do it for you, she did for herself. If she was doing it for you she would have done it long before you became a young adult.", "NTA. Your response could be callous of you were older but you\u2019re a kid still. Besides, you have a good point, you are strangers. Of course you\u2019re not gonna jump into treating her like a mother.", "People change and learn from experience.  Your bio mother was only 3 years older then you are now and likely have changed her world views wildly.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have expected more and your dad probably thinks having a relationship with her may be useful (he may or may not be right).", "Now, there is also the fact that she has your home address. Your dad hasn't had contact with them for 15 years, how stable they are or their intentions, but is ok Annie knowing where they live?"]}
