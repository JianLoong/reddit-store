I also struggle with infertility. I had three surgeries in the last year. I\u2019m now doing fertility treatments. I do stand a pretty good chance at conceiving with treatments, but staying pregnant is my big problem. First, I want to say that a miscarriage is NOT a greater loss than infertility. They are both hard. But they are different. It\u2019s like comparing apples to oranges. Finding out that there\u2019s a very small chance that you can have kids is a loss. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at gender reveals, baby showers, and nursery themes. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve imagined plenty of moments with your future child. Having that suddenly taken off the table IS a loss. You shouldn\u2019t feel like your pain is any less. Second, your in laws are 100% being assholes. Those comments are really painful, with any kind of infertility. I usually give a vague answer for the first or second time. After that, I will be bold and say exactly what you did. It makes people feel uncomfortable, just like they made me feel. However, I do feel like lying about a miscarriage is wrong. If you had said \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for years, but we saw a doctor and it turns out we\u2019re infertile,\u201d I would say NTA. I think I have to go with ETA. I think your in laws were being way worse, but I do think it\u2019s wrong to lie about having a miscarriage. They also may now think there\u2019s hope since you did get pregnant, you still could. They may ask you more questions, which can become a lot of lies. That\u2019s where I think it\u2019s more wrong. I understand you weren\u2019t lying about it for sympathy or attention. And while there are a lot of similarities between infertility and recurrent miscarriages, there are some differences. Miscarriages come with things infertility doesn\u2019t, just like infertility comes with things miscarriage doesn\u2019t. Without being too graphic, I lost a baby that was 10 weeks gestation. The fact that people would say they went through that when they didn\u2019t offends me a bit. The way you did it is much less offensive than those who did it for attention. But I still think it was wrong. Especially once a family member asks you questions about it and you have to go along with it. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this.

Actually, pissed off for OP, because I HATE having to answer these kinds of questions from people who have NO clue of what this pain is like, and because damn right, my medical history isn't anyone's business unless I choose for it to be.\n\nGood on you OP for shutting them the fuck up, as you should have \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb kudos.", "Damn right. 3 healthy kids, but also 1 miscarriage and 1 deceased infant, and completely with you. Reproductive problems are all painful, and I don't think those of us who have struggled with them are going to police each other on who has it worse.\n\nOP you have every right to claim miscarriage and NTA.", "Exactly this! \ud83d\udc96", "Yea if I\u2019m ever in a relationship and I start getting asked these things I\u2019m just gonna say \u201cwell we did have the most vicious sex, busted inside her and everything but I don\u2019t think we got it, I\u2019ll be trying again later today though!", "Unfortunately my friend who just miscarried this week had that same thing (at least we know you can get pregnant) told to her by her parents :(", "Same I've lost babies and I support this 100% because it hurts whether you lose them or can't have kids it hurts. I've even known a few who never want kids but still became devastated when they found out they actually couldn't have kids, with the question \"I know I didn't want them, but what if I change my mind and now I'll never get to\" it's heartbreaking", "NTA. Why do people think it\u2019s ok to discuss something so deeply personal?  One time I responded to a question like this with embarrassing sexual details.  That shut down the line of questioning once and for all.", "OP probably understands that with respect to BIL. I would imagine it\u2019s the ILs who can\u2019t grasp that concept.", "Oh lord, fertility questions! I hate those with a passion. My wife and I are both women and we get some extremely personal questions!\n\n\"So which one of you is the real mum?\" We're both mum, she's ours. \n\n\"I meant which one got pregnant?\" That would be me, but she's our child. \n\n\"Oh, so she's yours!\" *Looks right at me and ignores my wife. \"Was it hard to choose a donor?\" No donor, she's *ours*!\n\n\"Impossible!\" Sure, I chose to lie to you, random stranger. No, she is genetically ours. \n\n\"How can two women have a baby?\" Modern medical science. \n\n\"But how??\" I'm not drawing you a diagram! \n\n\"Oh! You carried her child?\" Gah! No! *I* was pregnant, she is *our* biological daughter, yes it *is* possible for a child to have two biological parents that are both women, and anything more than that is very much not your business! \n\nAt that point we'll usually get sworn at for lying. We don't want to give our medical histories just to shut people up, but they somehow take it as a deep personal insult when they can't work it out. Lady, (it's never yet been a man!), I don't GAF if you're confused! Even if you guessed it I'm not going to confirm it! All you need to know is that she's ours! \n\nI swear the next person who does this is being asked where they had sex and what position did they use to conceive their child!", "Yep. Every time my family asks my partner and I when we're having kids (we don't ever plan to), I turn to her and say \"you hear that? My family wants me to creampie you.\" They stopped asking after the second time, when they rolled the dice, thinking I wouldn't say the same in front of my grandmother. They forgot that I have no shame and my partner thinks making people uncomfortable for asking inappropriate questions is hilarious.", "She should rather stop seeing her family? \n\nWhy does it feel like a slap in the face to you? Can you explain how it affects you? \n\nI don\u2019t appreciate that you speak on behalve of \u201cevery woman who ever experienced a miscarriage\u201d, including me. I certainly do not agree with you. My pain isn't aggravated or affected in any way by OP\u2019s statement to her family. On the contrary, I feel compassion for OP who\u2019s going through involuntary childlessness. \n\nI think you might need more support dealing with your loss. Bashing other women experiencing similar problems won\u2019t make you feel better.", "I wanted to ask you what state, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s gonna be mine\ud83e\udd74", "I\u2019ve heard people say it\u2019s their right regardless of the fallout from the pregnancy especially it death in the table.  It\u2019s incredibly selfish.  You\u2019re purposely bringing a child into the world with the knowledge that you\u2019re likely no going to be able to take care of this kid thus pushing the task to someone else to not only take care of the kids but you too.", "Well\u2026 He has just as little knowledge about having miscarriages as you have with OP\u2019s situation. You have been pregnant. You don\u2019t know how it\u2019s to never ever even have been pregnant. Yet you also think you can shame her, tell her what she can and can\u2019t do using a vile formulation. Maybe that wasn\u2019t too nice or reasonable of you either?", "NTA and I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nFamily! I'm glad mine finally gave up on me.", " The in laws are the assholes. \n\nYeah lying is not good. And it was a bad thing to lie about. But they kept pushing and pushing. And it's not their business to know why there isn't a kid in the picture. And yeah they probably won't bring things up for a long time \n\nBut i suspect at some point they will. They sound kinda obnoxious and at some point after a certain amount of time will say oh but that was ... ... time ago. We want grandkids. When is. So and so going to have a playmate. And so on.  They sound obnoxious and asshole enough that would bring it up again. \n\nAll the comments posted that they said. Is about their wants and needs or had to do with others. \n\nI doubt they even asked you both if you even want kids. So they are the assholes. The lie got them off your back. So i don't think you are the asshole. But i think talk to your besty. That seems kinda a tough bit strong reaction.  Is it possible she has had a miscarriage ? Or something when she had a baby and then didn't ?  \n(You don't need to tell me. Obviously. I was asking. Though my phrase probably sounds that way. ) What i mean is talk to her.", "Sometimes you need to make people uncomfortable for them to realise how far they\u2019ve overstepped. \n\nI wish you the best in your quest to be the world best Aunt and Uncle.\n\n NTA", "NTA I'm so sorry about your fertility situation. And even more sorry your family are being so weird about it. Life can be still so fulfilling without children and I sincerely hope you and your husband can have that.", "In this case NTA. They made you uncomfortable in the worse way, you threw it back at them. Period.", "As far as I'm concerned as someone who has miscarried twice, OP is NTA. She shouldn't have to explain her infertility to them. And let's face it, if she did they would just tell her she's dealing with it wrong.", "Nope! NTA in my book. \nFellow woman who has fertility issues and have had two back to back miscarriages in the last year. I also have a toddler that we conceived with fertility treatments. It\u2019s shit. It\u2019s hard. You do / say what you need to get these people off your back.", "NTA, you didnt lie to manipulate someone, you lied so adults would stop asking, you didnt disrespect anyone who has miscarried, because you are also living with the idea that you will never have children of your own.", "NTA. As a person who chose to be childfree the endless bingos can be EXHAUSTING to say the least. IVF/surrogate/ adoption is not for everyone but some people will not accept that. So you said what you knew would make them shut up.", "Thank you all for this comment. We had the same issue. In the end I told my mum I have a low sperm count. People kept talking about IVF \nI mentioned low meant 0 sperm count. It was a horrible time.", "Also miscarried twice, and am unable/unlikely to be able to carry to term. OP can say whatever she wants to het nosy in-laws out of their business."]}
