No judgment here, OP.", "NTA they needed to learn to stop asking", "A miscarriage is not a greater lost, just a different loss", "NTA.  I'm a woman that has carried my firstborn child, my sweet baby girl to 6 months, only to go into preterm labor and watch her die an hr later. I've then had 6 years of unexplained infertility and finally was able to get pregnant and have four babies...I get it, I understand the frustration felt when people don't know when to back the hell off and STFU about these issues. They kept pushing and pushing and poking and prodding. I'm sorry you have to go through this.", "Eh, maybe ESH, I think lying is automatic asshole behaviour.", "ESH. They obviously suck for prying. Your mistake is lying. Unless the nazis are banging on the door asking if you're hiding any Jews in your basement, it's almost always going to be a moral and ethical fault to lie about serious matters (not talking about \"polite\" lies), and practically speaking it's going to backfire much of the time as well. Understandable error given the pressure of the moment but I'd not get in the habit of using fictions of that nature to take off the heat.", "NTA fuck them I'm glad you made them uncomfortable.", "NTA I had a mother who wouldn't stop badgering me about babies, I finally told her I can't, the doctors say I won't survive so she had a choice, you get me or a grandkid because both won't survive and there's a good chance both of us will die. Make a choice. I stood there staring at her waiting for her reply. She said she chose me and never brought it up again. \nSometimes tough love is needed when family don't back off.\nAnd anyone telling you differently hasn't lived through a pushy patent wanting to be a grandparent.", "NTA", "I\u2019m 18 F, got diagnosed with thyroid cancer when I was 16. I had it throughout all of my adolescence but it went undiagnosed. I never went through puberty properly and that alongside my medications and not having s thyroid, I\u2019ll never be able to carry to term. I could theoretically get pregnant but I\u2019m already grieving infertility. I don\u2019t want to grieve over a baby that gave me the hope of founding a family only to have it die. I understand why you told that lie. \n\nI\u2019ve been talking to other people who\u2019ve suffered infertility, miscarriages, etc and from what I\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t think you were insensitive whatsoever to lie about it. \n\nIt\u2019s a grief of its own but it\u2019s one that does connect us to others who\u2019ve struggled to start a family. You\u2019re NTA hun", "NTA. You responded to ongoing rudeness with something that would stop it.", "NTA, but lies tend to be found out particularly when there are some people who know it's  not true. At least two people know it's a lie so there's likely others who know too.  \nNext time someone starts the conversation, shut it down immediately:  \"It's a sore subject so let's drop it now\"  \"No, I don't want to have this conversation again\" \"Let's discuss your private matters instead\" \nHopefully, you've put a stop to this line of questioning.  If not, you're going to have to be blunt and say it's no longer up for discussion - say it very loud and very clear.  Your husband needs to tell his parents that you will not be producing any grandchildren and that you do not want to discuss the matter further.", "Most people i can just tell, nope, no kids, but hey we have awesome dogs!  Some people are...pushy. I've had to explain to some - truthfully- I had ovarian cancer, it really, truly wasn't possible.\n\nMostly that shuts them up,, but sometimes they STILL continue to push. I just blink at them because, seriously, what else is there to say at that point?\n\nFortunately in my case the family has been great though. Im so sorry you have to put up with this, OP. Whatever you need to do to make them stop the foolishness, you have my vote.\n\nNTA", "Personally, I feel like we should denormalize asking couples when they\u2019re having kids. It doesn\u2019t accomplish anything positive and it just serves to pressure the couple unnecessarily. NTA, it\u2019s already hard to know that you won\u2019t be having children despite wanting them, but your in laws drilling you guys with questions isn\u2019t helping anything.", "NTA - at some point though I think a very direct, \n\n\u201cwe are done having this conversation, we are not having children, do not ask about this ever again\u201d \n\nNeeds to happen, if they continue after that you should probably start cutting contact bc they clearly don\u2019t get what they are doing wrong", "NTA. It's completely fair to ruin their moods when they insisted on doing it to you!", "ESH- people shouldn\u2019t ask so they are worse, but you could just say you aren\u2019t having children and to stop asking. It\u2019s like lying about the death of a family member.", "YTA and you actually made the problem worse because now they actually believe that you have the ability to GET pregnant.  To which, I guarantee, they are going to resume the harassment after a few months.", "YTA for lying about having miscarriages. The trauma of infertility sold be enough. I hope you can set boundaries w them.", "OP, NTA but also this is not going to work out how you planned if your family is anything like my husbands. I had three losses in 9 months and it wrecked me. I anytime I was asked when I\u2019d give the family a baby I said \u201cWhen they stop dying inside of me.\u201d The same people asked me the same question the next time I saw them. You don\u2019t owe them your medical history but sooo many people have pulled the \u201cwell at least you can get pregnant\u201d bullshit with me. \n\nI\u2019m truly sorry for your circumstances and I salut you on your excellent auntie journey!", "Mother to a stillborn, and I'm saying NTA. You told them so many times it's not possible and they continued to push.", "NTA. I think sometimes it\u2019s okay to fib about something that\u2019s not true but could be true, if that\u2019s what it takes to make someone realize how inconsiderate they\u2019re being. Maybe there\u2019s someone in their life who they don\u2019t know has miscarried and this will cause them to check their fat mouths in the future. People get away with being like this because people are taught to hide their pain.", "NTA. I wish people would stop trying to pressure women to get pregnant. Not all women want to have kids, not all\nWomen can have kids.", "NTA. Given the circumstances, you HAD to shut them up. It\u2019s so insensitive of people to drill other people about their reproduction. Whether it\u2019s badgering a couple who chooses to be childless into having a kid they don\u2019t want, or constantly reminding a couple that they are struggling with fertility and cannot have a baby they desperately want. You do not have to justify anything to them. And the fact that they are giving you advice and options as if you haven\u2019t explored and discussed amongst yourselves is just so tacky.", "NTA, you did what you had to do to shutv them up.", "ESH. Just tell the truth or set a boundary. Don't claim a particular type of pain you evidently haven't experienced.", "My mother taught me at a pretty young age not to ask people about why they don't have kids because you never know what they might going through. I can't believe how many people don't get this!", "I have had 5 pregnancies that ended in loss \n\nAnd I completely understand why you lied.\n\nNTA", "I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for this response though, it makes so much sense. My friends had 3 rounds of failed IVF and when I had my miscarraige she was so ready to talk to because she understood. It was in a different way but we both had the loss of future as you've said", "I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s saying this, but as someone who can\u2019t carry to term, thank you. I don\u2019t know you but your response was very empathetic and insightful. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope that if there is a life after this one, your son sees you time and again living on with his memory in your heart.", "Not necessarily. Miscarriage and infertility are not mutually exclusive as far as I know. Or even if they are, she could say the situation changed. Just because you COULD get pregnant before doesn't mean that infertility can't come later.", "Agree, this won't stop the pestering. They'll just ask \"when are you trying again\"?", "Yeah this", "Miscarried twice here and if this shut them up then good.  Maybe they'll think twice before bilughing the next person.", "She\u2019s lucky they accepted it and let it go.  My in laws went on Google and started giving me diet and lifestyle advice", "I always love, \"Hopefully nine months from this morning!  Right, honey?\"\n\nPeople tend to back off.", "Persistent, intrusive comments are ineligible for attempts at humor. Glad they worked for you though.", "They should be respectful enough to not push. It's really frustrating and it probably happens with little comments, little \"jokes\", suggestions that are not at all subtle. Sometimes people don't listen and back off and need to be put in place harshly. Mine sure did. Not all parents listen.", "Because it's invasive as fuck??", "Oh helllllllll no. I'd go no contact with them so fast... I'm so sorry.", "THIS. I\u2019m 18, have thyroid cancer and a ton of complications that have made it where I will never be able to carry. Long story short, I\u2019ve had it for years and it\u2019s affected my puberty and certain things like my uterus never grew to a size large enough to accommodate a baby, I will never be able to regulate TSH to get proper prolactin levels to carry, my pelvis shape is too weird and small, and I haven\u2019t had a period at all in over a year now as part of that. But my mother has insisted since I was 16 (when I got diagnosed) that I still have my eggs. So has the rest of my family. They don\u2019t seem to understand that I can get pregnant but it will never survive and I would be putting myself at risk. I also don\u2019t want to have a baby via surrogate. I\u2019ve always wanted to adopt (I\u2019m gay and don\u2019t have the \u201cI want a mix of us both\u201d opinion I suppose). But it\u2019s holiday season.

She told them that she was physically incapable of carrying a child to term, and they still wouldn't quit pushing her to get pregnant. I don't condone lying either, but I have a lot of sympathy for OP. I honestly don't know what else she was supposed to do here."]}
