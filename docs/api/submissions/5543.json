I had many miscarriages and I know the fear the struggle the sadness and being annoyed with all the questions . This is so disrespectful exactly for the situation you are in . Never ask those questions to a couple . Especially in front of an entire audience", "NTA, it's the only thing that gets the to shit the f up", "NTA, but what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.\n\nThat lie is probably gonna come back to haunt you in some way. Lies about miscarriage rarely just end there.", "NTA. Having children is no one\u2019s decision/business beyond yourself & your spouse\u2019s. It\u2019s obvious that you\u2019ve told everyone that it\u2019s not happening in multiple ways, & none of those have worked; hopefully this will shut them up.", "Using a fictitious miscarriage as a means of finishing an on-going argument is wrong...you need to just give everyone concerned an emphatic NO and to stop bringing it up.", "Your in-laws are appalling to the extent that they deserve what comes. NTA. It shut them up.", "People really should not ask such personal questions. I'm sorry you even had to lie ,and go thru that situation. People are very rude and that probably was the only way you could hey them to leave you alone. \n\nI lost my 5 week old son earlier this year ,and yet even within a month later people still felt the need to make comments or ignorant suggestions....\"at least y'all know y'all can have a baby\" \"y'all can just take one of mines\" \"you not missing nothing kids expensive and bad\" and so much more that I won't even repeat. \n\nI hope you and your husband finds some peace and I hope they never ask you anything else again", "NTA\n\nI have had three miscarriages and I don't feel disrespected. How else were you supposed to get them to shut the hell up?", "ESH\n\nThem for prying and you for lying.", "op=YTA\n\nThat is a gross and disgusting lie. You are telling them you WERE pregnant which means they are now grieving the loss they think you had(yes, I realize it's only an \"idea\" but they don't know that).  \n\nAnd it doesn't really put an end to the future questions, because after some time they will ASK when you'll be trying again.  Which leaves you LYING again or telling them the truth(that you lied).  So you only put off the annoying, hurtful questions.\n\nIt is time for your husband to put on his BIG BOY Boxers and tell them to stop the baby talk.  You two cannot/will not be having children(your mutual decision on how much to tell the family) and that the TOPIC is off-limits.  The two of you need to come up with what will be said and what consequences the family will have IF they don't respect your boundaries.\n\nBut please, don't use this lie to shame them into silence.  It is Disrespectful to people who have lost a fetus/baby.  But more so, fundamentally, you are only going to cause more problems in the family dynamic.", "YTA", "ESH", "Soft YTA. \n\nDon't lie and use a miscarriage. I'm also infertile. A miscarriage and infertility are two very, VERY different things. Not cool at all to lie about it and it won't shut them down because now they think you can get pregnant still. I just told people if they wanted me to have kids they could write me the check for treatment/adoption/etc.", " I've had miscarriages, it's not something to throw around like that. \nYou have no idea what women who go through miscarriages actually deal with. \nJust feels wrong to lie about it. There were other things you could have said and your husband needs to step up and deal with his family.", "NTA.  I can't imagine how hard it must be to deal with a situation like this.  And then to have it made worse by insensitive, entitled jerks of inlaws who won't let up.  I don't blame you for snapping.\n\nBut I have to ask - where the hell is your husband during all of this?  Did he even say anything?  He should be the one telling his mom that it ain't going to happen and to shut the f up.\n\nSorry you have to deal with such crap.", "NTA. In essence, you may not have lost an actual pregnancy, but you\u2019re still coming to terms with the loss of your fertility as a whole. Yes it was a lie, but they were being much more rude by constantly asking and pressuring you to have children without respecting your wishes.", "I miscarried the only kid I'll ever get to be pregnant with, and while obviously I can't speak for everybody, I'd give OP permission to lie about this. The family needs to knock it the fuck off.\n\n(And I mean, it's *barely* even a lie; OP shouldn't have to give them her medical history.)", "NTA thank you OP for normalising miscarriages. It should be thought of more by nosey AHs.", "she lied about having a miscarriage there\u2019s nothing right about that and especially using it as a way to ruin someone\u2019s mood is inappropriate", "you can always just keep upping the tally of faux miscarriages. Maybe when you get to 6 or so they will lay off. I say this as a multi miscarrier. Anyone who disrespects you enough to pester you like this, does not deserve the respect of honesty.", "So sorry for your loss..", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Ugh, I hope they don't do that. The clich\u00e9 things people say to those who have miscarried never ceases to astound me. To anyone reading this, take note. This sort of comment to a grieving parent is neither helpful nor comforting.", "Thank you for explaining better than I did.", "Have you been told you will never be able to carry a pregnancy to term? If not, then you don't know that OP's grief isn't worse than yours. Have you given birth to children? Have any of them died? If not, then how can you say the grief of a dead child isn't worse than from a miscarriage? \n\nI'm very sorry for the loss you've endured, but OP telling family members this to shut them up made her life better Ave didn't actually hurt anyone."]}
