He has two children from his first marriage. Kai who is 28, and Mia is 27. My husband's first marriage ended during the pregnancy with Mia when his ex moved another man into their home. She told my husband to leave and she was planning to marry the other guy. A DNA test was done when Mia was born, and another was done on Kai later, custody was decided and the divorce was finalized when Mia was still a baby. I met him 6 months later and we married after a year together. \n\nMy husband's ex made our lives hell. She alienated the kids from me, we were in and out of court, therapy, they were always placed in mediation and co-parenting classes to try and get them to a better place. Nothing helped. Her second husband left and that only made her worse. Then she married again but that also ended.\n\nMy relationship with my stepkids breaks my heart. I love them, I have always tried to be a respectful and loving stepparent who doesn't talk bad about their mom, overstep my place or assume they would love me the same as their parents. But I hoped we would be close. They have been rude or distant and cold. But I loved them regardless and my husband took the lead with them. When my husband and I had our own two children together they did not bond with them but we still hoped time and therapy would help some kind of relationship form.\n\nNow my stepson is due to get married. He told my husband our kids were not invited since it was a child free wedding. But then he told me what I could not wear (because the two mothers were going to match the theme and I am not counted in that), that I would not be given a corsage to wear so people would know I was not one of the parents, he said I would not be mentioned in any of the toasts, I was not welcome to give a toast, that the photos with the parents and immediate family would not include me and after my husband asked him why he was making such a big deal out of this he said I needed to know my place and then admitted he didn't even want me there. So I made the decision not to attend and instead stay home with my children. I have reached a breaking point where I just no longer see a future where we might get along better and clearly I am not wanted at all. But my husband's family are furious and say I was invited so I should go.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669903069, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9oj9m/aita_for_deciding_to_skip_my_stepsons_wedding_and/", "score": 7032, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that you list because you seem to think they're inappropriate makes me question your assertion that you've always been respectful and never overstepped.\n\nWhat pushes me into thinking your stepson is acting maliciously is the fact that he is not willing to include you in any family pictures. As someone who recently got married, we simply did multiple iterations of family members for pictures. To be respectful to your role as his father's wife, he should've at least included you in a few family pictures. Of course, if you and your husband were insisting that you be in all of them, my vote would change to YTA.", "Info: had he not specifically instructed you not to, would you have chosen to wear the same color as the MOB and MOG?

You are, to him, his father's partner and nothing more. Did you honestly expect to be treated differently at his wedding? It seems like he set these boundaries because he's afraid that you WOULD overstep, and cause a scene when you were not in the pictures, or allowed to give a toast, or be considered and honorary person for his side. If the reason you don't want to go is because he doesn't want you there and you want to respect his wishes, then NAH.

Because there are ways he could be giving her the courtesy of acknowledging her as his fathers wife, while it still being different from what the moms are getting. But he's not even doing that.

If she's that bad, she likely wouldn't have been invited at all.\n\nOr.. Maybe this is one of those \"must invite the spouses\" thing and they still like their father but their stepmother is actually really bad. I can't imagine how they wouldn't have figured out by now that anything she does, he allows, so if she's really that bad, he's actually worse for allowing it.\n\nIdk, I'm on the fence, but tempted to believe stepmother is probably right here about the mom poisoning the kids against her. Dad should totally have stepped in, but considering he's letting his family shit talk her about not going, it might be that dad has a spine with all the integrity of a wet noodle.", "I doubt there's any missing info. I get how they can have so much ill feeling, even without anything to justify it.\n\nLook at their ages when their mom exited the marriage. ~1 and not even born. There's no mention of what the custody split was, but it likely had significant time with mom, especially early on.\n\nAlso notice OP said she married their dad 25 years ago. So about 2 years after mom left. Doesn't say when they met, but it was probably at least a year before that.\n\nIn another comment, OP mentions that the mom has made it very clear that she herself is and will be the only maternal figure in her children's life. Mom was probably feeding them a steady diet of poison thoughts about OP from infant / toddlerhood.\n\nThose poor kids probably never stood a chance of being able to establish even a cordial relationship with OP. Because hate was all they knew.\n\nThink of the posts here were someone describes some unusual (often abusive) family behavior. And how often, when everyone says \"that's not normal\", the op responds \"its not?\". The bad behavior is so normal, they don't realize its not what everyone does.\n\nProbably the same thing happening here.\n\nThe sad part is that apparently, if the ex were in a relationship, the son has said he'd have no trouble providing his mom's SO all the respect and courtesy he's deliberately denying OP. No doubt because mom has spent decades instilling in them that her relationships are a-okay, its just OP thats a problem. Yet mom is the one with two more exes.\n\nAnother part of what makes me think its all coming from the mom and not OP is what her planned course of action is. Its not trying to argue or fight for better treatment. Its to simply say \"You don't want me there, I will respect that and stay away\". Which is a decidedly mature way of handling it.\n\nWhere if there were problem behaviors on OPs side, an antagonistic \"I'll show and do everything I can to be miserable and make you miserable\" type reaction would be more likely.\n\nAs for dad or therapy setting them straight... Dad has probably been trying to avoid the risk of burning the relationships down by calling them out. And therapy only works if the people involved want it to work.

I brought 14 lipsticks with in the bag I had to carry around for her - apparently #15 was the correct one. She publicly berated me instead of taking her wedding photos.    \n\n\nI didn't have her in my wedding because why be fake? She showed up dressed like it was a funeral and decided to just walk down the aisle like she was a bridesmaid. Like, she made herself one right on the spot.

Wash your face free yourself from caring. His mom and your husband can now navigate life knowing they made a mean person", "Don't go, stay away from him and his attempt to make an 'example' of you. I'm sorry you're dealing with that, and I hope you have a good night with your children.\n\nNTA, clearly.", "I would definitely not consider them young enough to be excluded from a \u201cchild free wedding\u201d especially since they\u2019re family.", "Those aren't the kids they mean in a child free wedding, your step children are the product of their mother.", "I do not think she has a bad plan. I'm just meaner than she is and will lay traps for anyone who is crappy to me to fall into and break their heads.", "Or, OP\u2019s place is at Disney with her kids! (Or any other desirable vacation)", "Meaning no picture with just his ex and the child getting married. That's normal for children who have divorced parents.", "Bruh we gotta get Gandalf the White in here to exorcise Wormtongue from these stepkids", "OP, how much of the childcare was your husband doing vs the ex when they broke up? and shortly after? \n\ncuz the only thing I can think of that would cause this inequitable devotion to the ex, is if the dad had been fairly uninvolved or something like that. is that the case, by chance? or is it something else?", "Even better!  I like the way you think. \ud83d\ude0a", "Wait a minute---where do you get it that he's upset that she's staying home?  OP's post is full of everything he said to her about how much he didn't want her there.", "Ok, I stand corrected that the post doesn\u2019t say he wanted her to go, but then why is his family blowing up at her saying she should go?", "She's entitled to act like his father's wife, because that's what she is. Family spouses are often pictured in at least group photos. I know. My partner's niece got married, and I was in her family photos.", "So OP\u2019s step kids were 2 and 3 years old when their dad married OP, right? I think we need I N F O on how the kids treated her badly at that age. Something sounds off here to me.", "Right! This child was 3 when OP entered the picture. If things haven\u2019t improved in two and a half decades and the child is now an adult\u2026 time to call it.", "Honestly, none of that matters. The history cannot be changed. SS probably can't explain himself to himself, so he can't to us either.", "I think something's not being told to us. \n\nif these problems started when the stepchildren were very young, it honestly isn't on them, it's on the parents.\n\nhow is it a young child's responsibility to manage the logistics of blending a family especially if the parents new spouse just isn't someone they like or get along with? imo that responsibility is on OP's husband (their dad), the ex (their mom), and to a lesser extent, OP (the other *adult* involved). and I also don't see how it can be described as an 'abusive' dynamic when it's directional from a child to an adult, I understand that the stepkids are grown up now but that would still not make sense to say they've been 'abusing' OP for 20+ years", "I'm not blaming her, and blame no longer seems to be what's happening here.", "No, she didn't. Melania didn't enter the picture until later. Tiffany's mom, Marla, was Trump's other woman for a couple years of his marriage to Ivana.", "You're not blaming her, but the stepkids sure seem to be. It's pretty sad that they haven't put two and two together that OP was not the reason their parents divorced.", "Absolutely NTA and this is the most heartbreaking thing I\u2019ve read. I\u2019m sorry you were never even given a chance and your stepchildren, who are now fully grown adults, *still* resent you for no reason. The way your stepson treats you is disgusting", "NTA. Your stepson is though. I\u2019m so sorry he treats you this way", "NTA. He literally doesn\u2019t want you to go, so don\u2019t.", "NTA He doesn't want there and only invited you because his family would be dramatic if he didn't. Now you don't want to go and you're here asking if you're right because they're being dramatic.\n\nI'm sorry you don't have a relationship with him, but the only people who will be happier if you go to the wedding are the extended family pressuring both of you to put on fake smiles.", "NTA\n\nSorry your step kids are full of hate & spiteful. Block step son & any relatives giving you shit. Do not go and have a nice weekend with your kids and do some fun activities!", "NTA.  After so many years of shunning you, his detailed clarification of everything you weren\u2019t included in, couldn\u2019t & shouldn\u2019t do, etc was unnecessarily cruel.  I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve lasted this long.  It sounds like your stepchildren have taken after their mother.  If your husband has allowed this level of behavior to go on for 28 years, he\u2019s an AH.", "NTA. You can tell the family that your stepson stated he \"didn't even want you there,\" and you thought the best wedding present you could give him was your absence.  \n\nBesides, with his attitude, there is bound to be a second wedding in his future, and maybe he will be a kinder more mature person by then.", "Agreed - at the ages of 28 and 27, if the relationship hasn\u2019t happened it will not happen at this point. \n\nPut your effort and love into your relationship with your kids and your husband and forget about his angry relatives.", "The thing I don't understand is, how can OP be with someone who treats her, literally, as before a third class citizen .", "Honestly to me it just feels like stepson was pressured into inviting her (by the family probably) and tried to find a way for her not to come at all. Making her fe as unwelcome as possible, and straight up telling her he doesn't want her here when confronted.", "Kill them with kindness \ud83d\ude06", "Even most \"child free\" weddings I've heard of have not excluded kids in their late teens unless it was something where the venue didn't allow anyone under 21 or something. Honestly I don't know if your kids are hurt by being excluded from their half brother's wedding, but I would say the three of you should do something fun for yourselves that day instead of having you go somewhere you aren't wanted.  Obviously you can't expect your husband to go no contact with his kids but I see no reason why it is of any benefit to anyone for you or your kids to continue to interact with them.  Don't bother signing birthday or Christmas cards/gifts and your husband can handle those things.  Take your kids somewhere else if they visit. Don't accompany your husband if he's visiting them.  I can't blame them for being assholes when they were children but they've had 10 years of adulthood to make changes in how they treated you and you are not obligated to put up with the abuse anymore\n\nTell your husband's family that it was made clear that your stepson doesn't want you there and that your wedding gift to him is that you will avoid future interaction of any kind.", "I can believe what OP said. When my parents divorced it was incredibly hard, and my dad had so much hate for my mom he often tried to manipulate us against her and her new man. OP's step children were very young during the divorce and had even more time to be fed whatever the mom wanted to give them.", "My family is in a similar situation and honestly parental alienation can do this much damage.", "\"Why would anybody still pressure her to go with full knowledge that the groom has made clear he doesn't want her there?\"\n\n\\---because house fires draw large audiences\n\n\\---because for some reason they still don't believe it's as bad as it is\n\n\\--because there are always people with fatuous ideas about how love conquers all\n\n\\--because they have zero empathy with OP's pain across the years\n\n\\--because OP and husband haven't leveled with the family about the kids' horrible behavior[.  In](https://years.In) OP's shoes, it would be very hard---humiliating!!!---for me to acknowledge how badly the steps had treated me.", "Or a book of etiquette, or a self help book about growing up, or letting go of anger.", "HAHAHAHAHAHA", "And chosen his mothers path.\n\nOP should tell her husbands family that she will consider catching the next wedding if he learns his lesson.", "You can't blame the step mom when she has clearly never been supported by her husband.", "Haha bitter lesser demon. That is hilarious", "So in a few months we\u2019ll be seeing the bride\u2019s post in r/justnomil? Can\u2019t wait!", "It's very easy to blame the step parent as the reason why there is no relationship.\n\nIt's quite obvious that the bio mom did everything she could to make her kids not want a relationship with her. Remember that the kids were splitting there time between the two parents. \n\nI've been the step child in a situation like this. Let me tell you that this is more than likely the result of the bio parents influencing the child.", "That makes sense until you consider the fact that this has been going on for a quart of a century now. Those kids are now fully fledged adults capable of making their objective choices. Anything they decide on now can no longer be blamed on Mum and Dad's influence. Because, as full gown adults, they're responsible for all of their actions.", "Maybe I didn\u2019t word my response clearly. I wasn\u2019t blaming OP at all. I recognize that bio mom alienated the heck out of this relationship. I meant that it seemed OP tried to foster a relationship and after all these years and the kids reaching adulthood, if it hasn\u2019t improved then she needs to save herself the effort and stop trying.", "Sucks even worse when your own mother who ruined her marriage creating you then tries to make the person they cheated on the bad guy and then when that doesn't work... switches to blaming you for all their misfortune....\n\nNarcissists gonna Narciss", "And if I were the bride\u2019s parents, I would horrified to see the horrible son in law I was gaining. This reflects so badly on him.", "This is her husbands child. Not OPs child. The kid already had a fucked up life with a broken family and a psychotic mom. He sucks but if his dad misses the wedding he may regret it in the future.", "But, like..... Revenge for what...??? The ex kicked husband out. They divorced. And he didn't marry OP until a year and a half later. Why do the kids hate her so much?\n\nI mean shouldn't it obvious to the stepkids by now that their mother lied to them or purposely alienated them from OP? How stupid can you be? Ugh\n\nNTA OP. I wish you have a wonderful life with your own kids \ud83d\udc9c", "The most This that ever This\u2019ed.", "That is tough. My kids aren't old enough to be married but I cannot imagine the shame here. I wouldn't be able to look at my children the same way again and that sucks. Sorry for this situation.", ">you\u2019ll just be with your own children \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t work either, what about OP\u2019s husband, their father? Is he going to spend all his Christmases choosing between his kids and grandkids? Will they have both of their parents together for Christmas ever?", "Bravo. This perfectly summarizes the way parental alienation worked. \n\nI suspect the father has also never spoken to how their relationship ended, dna tests, etc. Which is very respectable but has unfortunate consequences when the other side isn\u2019t so honourable.", "\n>He\u2019s getting a kick out of making a teenage level show that YoU\u2019Re NoT My ReAl MuM.\n\nAn excellent level of maturity at which to embark on one's own marriage /s, obviously", "The mom probably told them that the dad cheated with her and she was the victim", "I second this. Definitely use this as a way to cut him completely out of your life. You don't need the negativity. I'm sorry you're going through this, but enjoy your time at home with the kids who matter and love you. NTA", "I could see doing that in a situation where the trap wouldn't necessitate a big effort.", "Parental Alienation is real.  My dad and his GF gave me the gift of showing their ass when I was 12 and humiliating my mom in front of me.   I never believed a word of their bullshit after that.\n\nThat was over 40 years ago.", "So real. My daughter is 18 and just starting to realize I was never the bad guy. It\u2019s hurting her so bad to see the people she trusted were liars. There is actually a psychological change that occurs during parental alienation.

Not to play armchair psychiatrist, but it's quite possible your sister had/has some undiagnosed personality disorder. This is not normal behavior.", "No one said it is their responsibility, no idea where you came up with that, but being unduly nasty and negative to someone and TRYING to cause them emotional harm is emotional abuse.
