He has two children from his first marriage. Kai who is 28, and Mia is 27. My husband's first marriage ended during the pregnancy with Mia when his ex moved another man into their home. She told my husband to leave and she was planning to marry the other guy. A DNA test was done when Mia was born, and another was done on Kai later, custody was decided and the divorce was finalized when Mia was still a baby. I met him 6 months later and we married after a year together. \n\nMy husband's ex made our lives hell. She alienated the kids from me, we were in and out of court, therapy, they were always placed in mediation and co-parenting classes to try and get them to a better place. Nothing helped. Her second husband left and that only made her worse. Then she married again but that also ended.\n\nMy relationship with my stepkids breaks my heart. I love them, I have always tried to be a respectful and loving stepparent who doesn't talk bad about their mom, overstep my place or assume they would love me the same as their parents. But I hoped we would be close. They have been rude or distant and cold. But I loved them regardless and my husband took the lead with them. When my husband and I had our own two children together they did not bond with them but we still hoped time and therapy would help some kind of relationship form.\n\nNow my stepson is due to get married. He told my husband our kids were not invited since it was a child free wedding. But then he told me what I could not wear (because the two mothers were going to match the theme and I am not counted in that), that I would not be given a corsage to wear so people would know I was not one of the parents, he said I would not be mentioned in any of the toasts, I was not welcome to give a toast, that the photos with the parents and immediate family would not include me and after my husband asked him why he was making such a big deal out of this he said I needed to know my place and then admitted he didn't even want me there. So I made the decision not to attend and instead stay home with my children. I have reached a breaking point where I just no longer see a future where we might get along better and clearly I am not wanted at all. But my husband's family are furious and say I was invited so I should go.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669903069, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9oj9m/aita_for_deciding_to_skip_my_stepsons_wedding_and/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be friendly and polite if you happen to meet and treat them like the strangers they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You should do what is good for you and your family. End of story.", " and then admitted he didn't even want me there.\nNTA. Remind everyone of this. You are respecting his true wishes. Take your kids someplace fun so you don't even have time to think about it.", "NTA, but if your husband goes, he will be.", "nah", "NAH\n\nWhile it appears you would like to have a mother/son relationship with your step-son, beit your husband's ex wife or not , you have been in your stepson's live for 25 years and you really don't have a relationship with him other that what you are...His father's wife. \n\nWhy, given the lack of relationship, would you assume you would be given the same courtesies as the Mother of the groom?  \n\nYou are not required to attend his wedding.  It would be a nice thing to do for your spouse, to accompany him.  Not attending may also impact your future relationship with his children, but you are not required to go.\n\nMany weddings are child free.  There is nothing wrong with him indicating that your children are not invited if it a blanket rule, which you did not indicate it was.\n\nIt really sounds like you are having a bit of a tantrum because you expect a role of honor where you really should not have one, but you are not a total AH because of this.  I would recommend thinking it through...think of the later impacts from your decision.", "NAH- You want to occupy a parents role in his wedding and he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t see you as a parental figure and that\u2019s alright. You also don\u2019t have to attend his wedding. How you will look is completely up to the people that knows the two of you. I don\u2019t see why anyone would assume you would be more than a guest at this wedding base on your description of the lack of relationship y\u2019all have.", "Ah, but she isn't. He wants her there so he can show the world how much he despises her. By not going, OP is ruining all of his well planned revenge. OP, I wouldn't go either.", "I would be tempted to go but wearing black and if asked say you are mourning the loss of any chance of a good relationship with him.\nNTA", "I read something very interesting today about how invitations are all about consent.  The inviter expresses what they consent to having the invitee do, and the invitee decides if they want to consent to that situation.\n\nThe \u201cstepson\u201d consents to having OP at his wedding so that he can performatively demonstrate just how unimportant to him she is.  (Which is a$$ backwards, mind, because if he TRULY didn\u2019t care about her, he wouldn\u2019t go to so much effort, but\u2026)  OP can choose to consent to being treated like this or not.\n\nOf course, no self-respecting person WOULD consent to being treated like this, so NTA OP and stand your ground.  Ask him (and his flying monkeys) why he wants you there so much if the only purpose of the invitation is to humiliate you.", "SS is a particularly fitting acronym, since stepson behaves like a Nazi hierarch.", "NTA, and your husband needs to tell his family to leave you alone. An invitation made grudgingly and with all these terms and conditions on it is not a sincere invitation,", ">Not only should you not go, you should hire a pack of wild clowns to show up during the ceremony. \n\nI'm sure you're joking, but please OP do not take this seriously and do this.\n\nUnless you want your husband to divorce you and make a huge drama bomb and mess with your stepsons wedding. Then go right ahead.", "Op is absolutely NTA.\n\nBut, if I went to a wedding of a friend/family member and witnessed this type of \u201ctreatment\u201d of a loving step-parent, I would feel terrible for the parent and disgusted by the adult child.\n\nHis behavior makes him look petty and spiteful.\n\nOp is completely right to not put up with it.", "Forget wishing happiness. Wish him the life he deserves.", "OPs invite feels like a trap meant to make her look bad in front of the extended family. \n\nIf OP doesnt go: \"See how she is?! I invited her, I extended an olive branch and she couldn't even be bothered to show up to my wedding!\"\n\nIf OP does go: \"See how she is?! Showing up to my wedding when I've made it clear I wanted her to have no part in it!\"\n\nDamned if you do, damned if you don't.", "Just tell him you'll catch him at his next one.", "My children are 15 and 16 (almost 17).", "Good question.  How old are your children?", "I never tried to be his mom. I always just wanted to be a safe adult in his life and have a loving relationship with him. But it would have been nice to not have everything I could not do or would not be included in laid out like I asked for anything, because I never did ask.", "I don't think he would use it against me because not only is this what he wants, but it is also what his mother will want. She's always been clear I should never have attended any school functions, games, graduations for her children and now the biggest one (arguably) she is getting her wish.", "He's on my side but this is his child at the end of the day and we will not let this completely ruin the relationship between them. I would never want that. But it will change. I have no doubt about that. But he will go because this is his son.", "What is he supposed to do? His ex is a grown woman. She has been told she needs to stop. He brought her to court when they were kids. He fought for his kids. Spent a lot of money. What more could he do about her? Other than not subject me to her which he did his best to keep us apart.", "I want him to go. He should still be there for his children. This does not have to end their relationship.", "He admitted he did not want me there. No, I did not expect to be treated as his mother, but I had hoped to be treated like I am part of his family. Or for him to at least want me there. He doesn't want either of those things. At the very least to be treated the way he was willing to treat his mothers significant other, if she had one. \n\nI also know I would not be granted a relationship with his children. I will always be kept to the side and given no title or place in the family.\n\nI still love him but I am not wanted and he was clear about that.", "Ya I agree. The planned humiliation is just cruel. Don't give him the satisfaction. After so many years if he says things like showing you your place when you have done nothing wrong it's best to show him that he doesn't have a place in your life as well. NTA.", "This is it, right here. NTA.", "Very well put. \ud83d\udc4d", "Congrats on the weirdest Godwin point I've ever seen!!", "Make sure you send him a card that says congrats on your first wedding.", "So not really kids in that aspect (when I think child free I think babies, toddlers, grade school kids). He\u2019s deliberately excluding his half siblings and sounds like a jerk. NTA. Go somewhere fun with them that day/weekend.", "Don't go even to spite him because you know what why waste the time on people who clearly don't value you. Don't let them live rent free in your head. You've done your best in a bad situation. i hope you find some happiness", "What does your husband say to all of this?\n\n\nNta I wouldn't go to a wedding that I  not wanted.\n\n\nI would say is expectations we're rude for saying it that way but given your relationship with him it's not unexpected.", "You tried your best to have a decent relationship with your stepson but it looks like things were too messed up for it to happen.\n\nYou are right in deciding to not attend the wedding - it\u2019s a start to the process of your moving on", "He's definitely been tainted by his bio mother.  I personally wouldn't go, just because I feel it would be toxic and cause unnecessary drama.  \n\nI like another posters comment saying to take your kids on a mini vacay the weekend of the wedding!  :)", "He's still going to use it against you. He's looking or reasons to justify his hatred of you.", "Your husband should 100% go. If he doesn\u2019t they will use it to say you poisoned him against attending and you will still be the talk of the wedding. You stay home, he goes, they have nothing they can get angry about", ">He should still be there for his children.\n\nI'm confused. The title says the kids are staying home with you because its a childless wedding. Whose children would your husband be there for?", "This doesn\u2019t sound like \u00ab\u00a0planned humiliation\u00a0\u00bb. OP has no relationship with this person and due to that she will not be included in the parental roles. He didn\u2019t maniacally invite her under the guise she would be celebrated and then planned to pull the rug under her feet at the wedding. The people giving OP shit needs to back off. He already admitted he doesn\u2019t really care if OP is there or not.", "And, I am sorry you are having to deal with this. I hope you and your husband are able to get through these situations without damage to your  relationship. It puts both of you in an impossible situation.", "I'm sure Mama Wormtongue has poisoned his mind against them as well.  \"Your dad loves his new family more than you.\"", "And take tons of pictures to post on social media, if you have one lol.", "He's not happy with how his children treat me. Especially with all this. But he loves his children and that won't change. He spoke to his son and told him he was disappointed in how he treated me. He is also aware the kids know their mom hates me, and never felt I belonged, so this is just years of picking up on that.", "At this point who cares? He's not a kid anymore. OP isn't going to change his mind and it's pointless to try.", "Which, unfortunately, will not at all prevent them from getting angry.\n\nYou're right, though.", "His son, the one who is getting married. Regardless of anything Kai and Mia are still his children.", "OP's husband has 4 kids. 2 with OP who are children. 2 with his ex who are adults. One is getting married and doesn't want OP there. \n\nOP only has 2 kids. Both with her husband. Her kids aren't invited so OP wants to stay home with them.", "Yeah I gotta say it. Your step son sounds like an AH. Don\u2019t go and make sure your husband has your back and tells the in-laws exactly why you\u2019re not going. But you better go do something fun for yourself while the wedding occurs so you\u2019re not stuck thinking about it. Spa day! Hell- spa weekend!", "NTA. It might so be time to have a conversation about what happens if your stepkids have kids of their own. What role so you want to play after how you've been treated?", "I won't be given a role in the lives of their children. That's pretty clear to me."]}
