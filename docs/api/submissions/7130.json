When my back is turned, he's munching on something. As long as hes not eating heavy calories and gaining weight, I don't think too much of it. I cook meals almost daily, and enough for leftovers for everyone. My dinners consist of 1 protein, 1 carb, and 1 vegetable, or just 1 protein and 1 vegetable. Both my husband and son love my cooking, and has not made any complaints about it, my husband just likes to eat out after work.\n\nMy husband Mike loves to go to the bar every week after work and order himself some comfort food. Theres a rule that if he bring home food in a tray with his name on it, its his to eat and its off limits.\n\nMy son breaks that rule on a consistent basis, which pisses Mike off to no end. So much so at one point, my husband will start screaming and cursing if he comes home from work to find his favorite ribeye gone. He told me that I need to teach my son respect or he will do it for me.\n\nI have told my son who already has a hard time doing what he's told to stop eating his father's food. I have reminded him numerous times not to touch things that don't belong to him and I'm not about to put up with his father's hissy fit because he doesn't listen. I warned him that if he does it again, he is on his own. My son complained that he never gets to have what dad gets and it's not fair that dad gets steak and ribs and all he gets is chicken, turkey, and porkchops. I reminded him that steak is too expensive to be bought every week. (It's $14 a pound where I am.)\n\nI was going to talk to my husband to see if he can buy some extra food for Adam to see if this would stop. But I feel like I'm not taking my son's needs into account, and I think he feels left out.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT. HUSBAND DOES NOT BEAT OR HIT HIS SON. LESSON MEANS JUST YELLING AT AND TAKING PRIVILEGES.

Maybe not every week, but sometimes\n- Mom: nope, sorry can\u2019t afford it. \n- Son: But dad does it every week?\n- Mom: sorry, that\u2019s your dad. We can\u2019t afford that. Even though you could feed a family of 3 on steak at minimum 1 likely 2 meals for one of his nights out.\n- Dad is a bio dad but can\u2019t be bothered to get his son nice food once in a while. At first I thought, maybe stepkid with split finances, fine, but no, this is *his* kid\n- Not only does dad eat out every week he gets extra food to bring home and save son can\u2019t touch \n- Son acts out, fathers reaction is to scream and yell and curse rather than listen to the poor kid for once\n\nYou\u2019re showing him dad cares more about food than him.

You said steak is too expensive to have every week???? NOT too expensive for dad, just for you and son.", "Sounds like dad needs to sit down with his son and tell him how he feels. And the boy needs to tell dad what he told you, that he feels left out. And then dad should take the boy to the bar with him or just somewhere to get steak together. \n\nSounds like your son just wants to be included and have a good time eating ribs with his dad. If that's right then that's a good sign, better for the boy to want to be included than to want something that's actually bad. He wants a good thing, just include him. It's fun to eat out and it could be a bonding experience for the both of them. It's weird that dad is making you chide the boy and calling him \"your son\" is weird too. They could use some bro time. Call it guys night.", "YTA\n\nI was really ready to go both ways. He\u2019s 11, he needs A LOT of food. Which you acknowledge. Cool. Your husband wants to eat food that he has specifically written his name on. Cool, that\u2019s fair. Your son complains he wants some of the food his dad gets, because he never gets steak and ribs and dad does. \n\nRecord scratch. Problem. \n\nYour husband goes out to a bar every week after work and buys this food for himself. You claim buying this food for the family is too expensive. These two statements are mutually exclusive. If you have money to go to a bar EVERY WEEK then you have money for these meats. Off the top of my head here a steak or ribs at a bar will cost $18-$25 (checking my favorite pub a sirloin is $24 where it\u2019s $6.99 a pound at my grocery store). Even at $14/lb you have that money if he\u2019s buying it AT A BAR. \n\nYour son should be respecting the name on food rule, he\u2019s old enough. But he has a valid complaint here.\n\nEdit: changed ruling after I saw you tell an 11 year old he\u2019d be on his own. No.\n\nEdit 2: in other comments you mention that so long as the bills are paid you don\u2019t get a say in how he spends his money. Yes, you do.

I'm sure your food is fine but how come your husband who supposedly loves your food getting food somewhere else is fine but your eleven year old son who is still at an age where you explore the world can't have a steak or fast food or whatever occasionally. Your husband also sounds super unlikable. a) why is it YOUR son just because he's mad about some food, b) no, it's not normal to yell at your 11 year old unless they do something REALLY bad like breaking your car on purpose in defiance or something like that. c) imagine THREATENING to teach a lesson.

Just like its cheaper to buy and make your own beef. If he's the one in control of all the money, you better be careful how you word your 11 year old would be \"on-his-own\".\n\nAlso, he must be a stepfather if he is addressing your kid as \"your kid\", because any real father wouldve already given their child a lesson on this issue.", "YTA. Why would you stand for your husband to yell at your kid? That is unacceptable. It is also an asshole move for your husband to go out and buy food no one else ever gets to eat. Why does your husband go out by himself EVERY week and then bring food home to rub in your faces? Why doesn't this bother you? I don't understand why you are saying it is \"his money\". I think it is inappropriate to have food in the family house that only some people are allowed to eat, unless it is for medical reasons. You're on the path to have your son never speak to either of you again in the future. Why ever would you say your son is \"on his own\"?! Your job as a parent is to always be there for him. If you really believe your husband is throwing hissy fits, why would you continue to put up with that BS? You're taking it out on your son, rather than expecting the grown adult in the relationship to act like a grown adult. While your husband may not hit your son, and I'm not sure I believe you, y'all are definitely being emotionally and financially abusive.\n\nINFO: Do you work?

Meat is expensive, it sucks, but don't act like you're going to be buying 3lbs of meat so everyone has their own 16oz slab of meat.

His dad goes every week and gets this special comfort food, but good or bad, Adam doesn't get that. The issue is Adam feels like he is being treated unfairly, like he is being left out or punished. He takes his dads food because, even if he is punished, he gets a treat too. Your husband is ranting about respect but it has to go both ways or its just control. Negative reinforcement isn't going to solve the issue- he's just going to dig in more.  Find a way that Adam doesn't feel like he's being excluded from something special and this behavior will probably change. \n\nYour husbands a bit of an asshole though, every week he goes and treats just himself to something no one else in the family gets and won't even share the left overs.

I can't keep either one of my kids fed! \ud83d\ude33 And for dad to go out and spend money on takeout good food and not bring any back for the family, well, that's abusive too.
