We have half custody with his mother and on nights he is with her, they always sleep in the same bed (parents have been separated since he was 2).

When my step-son comes over, his dad sometimes cuddles him to sleep, which can take either a few minutes, or up to an hour. I never minded this, I would go do something else and I never complained about it, I get it. After a while, my husband stopped cuddling but would always tuck in, and started staying up to watch adult shows or hang out. After a while, when my step son would get upset about not getting his way or what have you, and he started saying he\u2019d rather be at his moms house to sleep every night. My husband asked him what we could do to change his mind, and he said that he doesn\u2019t like being alone in the bed and wants someone to cuddle them every right because they sleep with their mom every night at her house and at our house we have each other and he is alone. Of course my husband acquiesced to that and my step-son was happy. From that point on, my husband and I would alternate nights cuddling him to sleep. Fast forward over time, we cuddle every night, so much so, that at bed time, my step son asks expectantly \u201cwho\u2019s turn it is tonight to cuddle\u201d and if he\u2019s in the bed and we\u2019re not there, he gets impatient and calls after us every couple of minutes, he expects us to do it, and we do.\n\nTonight, I\u2019m exhausted, we had a long day with my step-son consisting of water parks, boba, friends, you name it and when bedtime rolled around, he asked who\u2019s turn it was and I just didn\u2019t feel like it. My husband pleaded with me to do it as a favor to him because even though I did it yesterday, tonight he wants to stay up and hang out uninterrupted and get some work done. I told him it\u2019s not a required job and that step son can just go to sleep. My husband got irrationally mad and started telling me that I\u2019m literally denying cuddles to a \u201clittle kid\u201d and shouldn\u2019t deny them because I\u2019m probably going to go to sleep anyways. He\u2019s arguing all of this while step sons door is wide open. I asked him to tuck him in and please close the door. Again, I firmly said no, and that sometimes, stepson just wouldn\u2019t get cuddles and that\u2019s okay.

Yes, cuddles are nice, but you are no more obligated to cuddle him than his dad and the whole thing seems weird.", "NTA", "What happens when he is invited to a sleepover?", "NTA\n\nIt was your husband's turn, the only person denying the kid cuddles was him XD If you're largely fine with the arrangement, remind him of that and that cudding his son is his responsibility. He's lucky you've been willing to stick to the schedule thus far, and he doesn't get to try and guilt you into doing things you don't want to because he wants to \"hang out\".\n\nIt seems like you were both tired and grumpy and otherwise occupied, so hopefully things will be ok in the morning. But whether it is or not, remind him that arguing in front of his son (or at all, but especially then) is probably NOT a good thing to be doing and that him trying to guilt you by doing so was unacceptable.\n\nThat being said, if this is going to be an ongoing thing and you have issues with it, you may want to have a serious talk with your husband about what you are and aren't comfortable with/how things are going to need to be going forward. Preferably when you're both rested, have time, and the kiddo isn't there. In that case, make it clear that you don't want to get between him and seeing his son, and that you love your stepson and him, but that this isn't something you're willing to do forever and either he needs to be willing to commit to doing it every night his son is with you or to start getting the kid used to sleeping alone sometimes (a skill he will probably need eventually, although maybe not just yet).", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s 10. Your husband and his mom have basically succeeded in raising the picture boy for co-dependency.", "NTA  unlike many of the comments I've read,  I did cuddle my mom pretty much every night even past the age of 10.  I'd go to bed with her and when my dad came to bed he'd move me to my own room. But you do have to eventually make the kid feel comfortable going to bed and sleeping on their own, and the long- standing habit of sleeping the whole night with his mom may mean he has some fears of being alone. I'm curious if there's a way to mix up the bedtime routine to make him feel better about not having extended cuddles while giving you back your nights.  Things like: cuddling on the couch for the last few minutes before bedtime, having a stuffed animal that he sleeps with to \"keep him safe\", having a family pet (if there is one) stay in his room, etc.", "I don\u2019t even cuddle my 3 year to sleep. No NTA", "NTA I\u2019m amazed you\u2019ve even agreed to this batshit practice even once.", "NTA.\n\nYour step son is 10. My son is 10. He doesn't need to be cuddled to go to sleep. He likes a quick cuddle and kiss to say night night and then off to bed. He reads for a bit and then goes to sleep. I check on him to see if he's ok and asleep. He can be very manipulative though if he's not tired and wants to stay up but my husband and I have been nipping that in the bud. Unless your step son has additional needs there's no need for this. Yes there will be the odd time if he has nightmares etc but he is old enough to get to sleep on his own.\n\nSounds to me that you and your husband are tired of this and taking it out on each other. Resentment builds so sit down and try and come up with a plan.", "I\u2019m going with an ESH.  \n\nBut first, perhaps it\u2019s time for your husband to speak with your step-son\u2019s mother about the child\u2019s sleeping arrangements. All three of you can work together to try slowly transitioning him from the current bedtime routine into a more independent one, and if that doesn\u2019t work or in addition to that, consult with a child psychologist or therapist to see if they can address the underlying reasons for his behavior. (This is assuming he is telling the truth about not liking to be alone at night, and not just playing on your sympathy)\n\nAs for the situation, I can\u2019t fault you for not feeling up to it after a long and busy day, and you\u2019re NTA for telling your husband you don\u2019t want to do cuddle duty that night. But\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s why ESH: Assuming your husband was with you the entire day, it sounds like you both were tired and forgot that this particular responsibility involved a child\u2019s feelings; it wasn\u2019t just an argument about who has to take out the trash. A trash bag doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s taken out willingly or begrudgingly, but a child does. And hearing his parents bickering over who has to cuddle with him will only make him feel unwanted/burdensome/unloved/etc. \n\nLastly, for all those saying that 10 is too old to be sleeping in the same bed with a parent, I respectfully ask you to back off. Every child is different and there may be legitimate reasons for the boy\u2019s behavior. In fact, I\u2019ve got a similar situation with my niece who\u2019s the same age. \n\nMy sister and her husband split up several years ago, when my niece (I\u2019ll call her Joy for expediency) was still very young. My sister simply left one night and the rest of our family was left trying to explain where Mommy had gone and why. Despite being so young, it was extremely traumatic for her, and as a result, when Joy would stay with my parents and I on weekends or holidays (she lived with her dad full time), she always wanted someone with her from the time she went to bed, until the time she woke up in the morning, so she knew she wasn\u2019t being left behind again. \n\nAs Joy\u2019s gotten older, it\u2019s slowly transitioned from someone with her all night, to someone there until she falls asleep and someone there in the morning, and most recently, she\u2019s gotten okay with going to bed on her own as long as someone is there when she wakes up, which means she goes to sleep in my parents bed, and when my mom goes to bed, she sleeps in her bed with Joy and my dad sleeps in the guest room. Other than her preferred sleeping arrangements, Joy is a normal and perfectly healthy and happy child. \n\nI will note, however, that at home she sleeps in her own room, but this is only after her dad and his partner bought a house a couple years ago. Prior to that, she shared a room with her step sister, so she wasn\u2019t alone at night. \n\nAll this is to say, there could be a lot more going on that we don\u2019t know about. \n\nSo. There\u2019s my thoughts, for whatever they\u2019re worth.", "You and his dad set up a routine with your stepson. He got used to it and now expects it. To just stop suddenly with no explanation obviously would upset a 10 year old. It would have been decent to at least explain to your stepson that you were tired and that you'd like to see if he could fall asleep by himself tonight. I always go with the philosophy of do unto others as you would want them to do unto you. It's considerate, empathetic, and teaches by example. I want my children to grow up to be kind, considerate adults.", "Info is the child on the spectrum? NTA nonetheless but this is very wired borderline \u2026idk but I think his mother need to be reported or something\u2026this is very wired.", "NTA.\n\nHIS kid, HIS responsibility.\n\nALWAYS.", "NTA.   The ex is not doing this young boy any favors.     At this rate, he will be 18 and still in mom's bed.     Is she projecting her needs on him?   (Not sex, but a body at night?)   A discussion needs to be had without the kid being in the house.", "Problem is, the child has another place he can sleep and be cuddled so he will just go there instead.", "I'm sitting here thinking the same thing. Like what happens when he's 12-13, y'all just still crawling into bed?\n\nYikes.", "Exactly this. Sometimes I go into my son's (age 10) room because I want to cuddle. He tolerates me for about 10 minutes and then tells me to get out. :)", "He only sleeps in his mom's bed, not his dad and step-mom's bed. \n\nAgreed with e erything else you said!", "So if he wants cuddles until he\u2019s 46 they have to do it?

The mother is dead wrong for making him that dependent upon her and.prob she is used to sleeping with him too.", "And decent parents have these discussions with their children, not just randomly decide that they can't be bothered one night.", "He has a father in the house from what I heard.", "NTA\n\nThis is weird as fuck and I\u2019d run a mile.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to do this either, but it\u2019s not alien to me. \n\nOP, when my younger daughter needed this kind of contact (she wasn\u2019t raised this way), we bought here a giant u-shaped pillow and put it under a tight sheet to hold it in place. It created a little cocoon to sleep in without feeling the emptiness of sleeping alone. I highly recommend it!", "I think hubby wants his son to get the cuddling he wants, so he keeps coming over on their custody days. But hubby also doesn't want to be the one to do it. So he'll slowly push that responsibility onto OP. I mean he had stopped the cuddles until the son threatened not to come over anymore. And now he's trying to guilt OP into doing it on his night. OP was right to refuse. Otherwise she'd have slowly found herself doing it every night. Plus step-son needs be weaned off the nightly cuddles. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "A weighted blanket might be exactly what he needs to break the habit. That\u2019s a good idea.", "YTA", "Yes, so many of these replies are wild. 10 is a real transition age where some kids feel quite mature and others are still quite young. It's an age where routine can still be hugely important and he is navigating two very different ones. We also don't know how well mum and dad are co-parenting. This kid is looking for some nice comfort and caring. Maybe he is playing them off one another, but again that's usually symptomatic of something bigger. Simply refusing a cuddle isn't going to solve it. \n\nHe will almost certainly grow out of this in the next few years. OP and her husband can't cuddle a kid, what, two nights a week each? Agreed that ESH.", "Also problem is soon the child will reach the age where bed sharing will perk CPS's interest, innocent or not.", "I clearly misread that part, I thought when he was \u201cwaiting in bed\u201d she meant in their bed. Regardless of beds, why tf would you cuddle a 10 year old child, let alone a step child? Does mom not have a new boyfriend so she\u2019s projecting her loneliness and insecurities onto that child? And the fact dads so defensive about it? \n\nThats just going to be nothing but arguments and drama as time goes by. If someone \u201cyells\u201d because you didnt want to cuddle their child, imagine what else she gets yelled at over nothing. If OP is questioning her common sense beliefs, sounds like her mans is just an abuser. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
