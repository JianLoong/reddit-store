We have been together 6 years and married for 4.\n\nShe has two wonderful children from a previous marriage--they are with us Monday-Friday and then go with their biological father after school on Friday. I love them very much and I consider them my own children.\n\nI work a full time job as an executive in a technology company. About 50 hours per week, travel about 1 week every two months or so. My wife is a stay at home mom. She does fantastic. She had her first child at 18 and has been a stay at home mom since--this is soon to be important.\n\nRecently she met a friend who is 25, single and loves to party. And slowly but surely, my wife started to pick up on this life style. Now we're at full tilt. I took notes of the last 12 weekends just to see if I'm crazy, and I know Reddit loves good data.\n\nCounting Friday and Saturdays over the last 12 weekends includes 24 \"weekend nights,\" stretching back to the week of Halloween. Out of those 24 days she went out for 17 of them and generally does not come home until after 2 AM. She texts me generally the whole time she's out but she drinks (which is fine), smokes (not a fan of) and now has told me she has tried coke/cocaine once or twice.\n\nTime for a quick detour. Growing up I had only my mom and her \"roommates.\" My mom was a stripper--and her varying and often changing roommates were also strippers. From around the age of 8 would tuck me into bed, tell me she'd see me in the morning and then (unbeknownst to me for a long while) leave to go work at the strip club. I distinctly remember so, so, so many times waking up to find the house completely empty and eerily silent and crying myself back to sleep.\n\nAnd I was also very confused as to why my mom would do that to me, but I knew--even if I didn't know the word at the time--I was being abandoned. Eventually I became numb to it. I don't speak to my mom anymore, 24+ years later.\n\nI feel that now. Even as it's Friday and my wife is taking a nap before we go to dinner and drive separate cars so she can go hang with her friends at the bar afterwards until 2 AM. We've had it out before. I've told her I felt abandoned and her response was: \"I never got to go out. I had kids. They're with their father on the weekends so I know they're safe. I'm sorry I like to go out with my friends. I don't know what to tell you.\"\n\nI wanted to say: \"I'm sorry you had children. That was your decision. And now you're 30 (which is a bad argument, age shouldn't be a factor here but I'm winging it), and you're married and if you want to go sometimes that's fine. But I think you are going out too much.\"\n\nI'm writing this post because not only am I concerned with am I being the asshole.  \n\n\n I have my own hobbies and my own friends but I like to see my wife.

Thankfully her children have that parent to go to but if she's doing coke I can absoluetly see this going in a bad direction.  \nMaybe suggest going and seeing a therapist or marrige counciler, see if this is her way of rebelling or maybe a midlife crisis.

She's risking literally everything with her behavior.", " The real question is, why isn't she inviting you along? It's one thing to have a girl's night, even a few times a month, but this is excessive. I can't imagine being married and never going out with my spouse. You think she'd be excited about getting to have date nights with her weekends free...\n\nNTA", "I'm going with NTA.\n\nThe fact she's going out that often, experimenting with drugs, and taking no time for you both to enjoy your marriage is concerning. There's definitely nothing wrong with a girls night out or with having friends, but her patterns are getting worrisome. Cocaine is NO joke, and binge drinking can lead to alcoholism quicker than you can snap a finger. \n\nShe's trying to live out experiences she missed. I get that, BUT, there's no going back. She's married. She's a mother. You can't just jump back in time and pretend to be young and untethered. She's essentially trying to live two lives now, and there's no way they won't keep clashing. \n\nIt's time to have a serious talk with her. Even marriage counseling if she'll agree to it. That said, I would also recommend therapy for yourself as well. If this is triggering childhood trauma, you owe it to yourself to have a safe place to work through that.", "NTA. time together is important and she is making some risky decisions too.", "NTA. Might I recommend seeing a couple\u2019s therapist? It sounds like your wife never got to have fun in her 20s, so is trying to do that now. I can understand that. That being said, if it\u2019s that excessive then she really does need to slow down a little bit. Maybe try approaching the conversation by affirming and validating her- it might be more effective. Ex: \u201cI love it when you go out and have fun, and it makes me really happy to see you happy. I want you to keep doing that, but I\u2019d also like you to choose to spend a little more time with me instead of going out sometimes, since you do it so often. I miss our time together, and it\u2019s making me feel neglected. How about we have a date night every Sunday and spend time with the kids on Monday?

That\u2019s prioritising them over your shared marriage. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to be able to go out and about in this situation, but that generally is when both parties are happy with it. That isn\u2019t the case here. And normally it\u2019s not most nights. \n\nAnd she\u2019s tried coke \u2019once or twice\u2019 \u2026 how many times. Once or twice is something you\u2019d remember. I suspect it\u2019s more. She\u2019s fallen in with a party hard crowd that are probably doing more than a rare snort of coke\u2026 and she\u2019s doing this without you so clearly after you\u2019ve headed home. \n\nYou are both leading fairly different lives at the moment, and its perfectly fair for you to raise this and say \u201cthis isn\u2019t what I thought we were about\u201d and \u201cPlease can you wind it back a bit and can we have some time together.

Out all weekend, doing cocaine. Those are some serious signs. Often, married people especially those who were parents at a very young age tend to want to experience that other side of life where the fun and the glitz of it all makes it seem as though the grass is greener on the other side.\n\nIf not dealt with she could begin to spiral. Cocaine makes people do things they wouldn't normally do and sometimes that's with other people. She won't hit her until it's too late so I hope you two can work it out.", "NTA. There is a time and place for everything. Sadly, we all have to come to terms with the fact we've missed the window of time to experience some things and move on, adjusting our expectations. She is trying to 'have it all'. What that will do in the long run is a) lead to riskier and riskier behaviours as it's already escalating and she will eventually cheat on you, get roofied or get raped b) lead to resentment build up in from watching your partner bail on the marriage and c) cause you to divorce.\n\nWhat she's doing simply isn't fair. If she wants to continue living in a state of perpetual stunted adolescence - that's her decision. You don't have to bankroll or support that.\n\nedit: I grew up at a time and in a country when urban exploration was not a thing. You went into an abandoned building/place, you were getting raped and murdered - not necessarily in that order. Now, so many 20-somethings are doing it. I'm so jelly in my belly. I'd kill to grab a backpack and go exploring deserted, crumbling ruins from 500 - 1,000 years ago - there's plenty. But I can't and I won't. As a mother and a wife, I fully realize the ridiculous amount of risk I would take on just to satisfy a curiosity and an urge for exploration at the expense of my family's wellbeing.

She is point blank telling you that YOU are not one.  Partying and pretending she's 20, doing drugs and feeling free from all responsibilities is her priority.\n\nThere is no way that what she is doing is OK on any level.  Going out with friends and having fun is one thing.  What she is doing is quite another.  It's going to crash and burn hard and she will only have herself to blame.  There is only one way this ends, and it's badly.", "NTA\n\nAbsolute red flags here. Your wife wants to go consistently party, on your dime, without you? Once in a while is fine but every weekend for months is excessive.\n\nI\u2019d be more concerned if she is faithful or not but that\u2019s just me.

Relationships are two way streets, if she\u2019s not willing to at least hear you out then it\u2019s up to you to determine if it\u2019s worth the effort for what could be a \u2018phase\u2019 or make changes. As long as you don\u2019t try to full stop her without being reasonable you\u2019re fine.", "NTA. That would drive me crazy. Many may say that YTA because she\u2019s her own woman and can do as she pleases but I think couples have a responsibility to make each other feel cared for, and prioritised (sometimes) when it comes to friends. It\u2019s not controlling to want your wife to not act like a 21 year old party animal for the sake of her relationship", "NTA. You're married.  It's reasonable to ask your spouse to (1) spend more (not all, just more) weekend time with you than she does her \"friends,\" and (2) not drink excessively or do drugs. I get that she had kids too young and wants to reclaim some of her missed early adulthood experiences, but she's focusing on the wrong ones.  What about college, travel, etc.--things that she could either do with you or that would help fill that void more constructively?\n\nI've known people in her position.  She may just have her fill and snap out of it one day and things will be back to normal. Her friend may grow up and settle down and force an end to the crazy nights.  But there's always that possibility that she continues on this path until you don't even recognize her anymore.", "NTA and she admitted to doing drugs to boot. You have already expressed to her you dont vibe with the partying lifestyle. I dont understand why she cant cut back a bit epecially after you have expressed that you dont like it. As you have said, you arent trying to stop her just get her to cut it back a bit. I think its s smart move on your part. You arent trying to control her or who she spends time with. But you do miss spending time with her. It sounds like she is slowing morphing into someone you dont know. \n\nHow does all this partying affect her during the regular week?", "So in the past 12 weeks does she spend any significant time with you?  What are you getting from this relationship?  From what you wrote she is getting someone to pay for her and her kids during the week and for her to relive her 20\u2019s on the weekend.  This would be a deal breaker for me.", "NAH\n\nHer desire to use her free time without kids to do things she missed when she was younger is valid.\n\nYour trauma and abandonment fears are also valid.\n\nI think relationship counseling would be a good way to go in y'all's situation.  Try to frame your requests around getting what YOU need, not telling her that she is \"going out too much.\"  Too much is subjective.  It doesn't feel too much to her.\n\nLuckily, you don't need to figure out how much is too much.  You need to learn to ask for the care and attention you feel you are missing.  And she might be able to provide those things while still enjoying herself.\n\nI hope you two can learn to work together to solve this as a team.  That's what a good marriage should be able to do.  Things go through ups and downs, people grow and change, and sometimes change can be scary, especially around traumas.  Be gentle with yourself, and with her.  Maybe try going out with her sometimes?", "I think she is headed down a slippery slope and needs to reevaluate what she wants from her marriage with you. This doesn\u2019t seem much of a partnership. I hope your talk goes well. NTA", "This is a mixed bag. \n\nConcern around the smoking and the coke is valid. Wanting to have more time with her seems valid. \n\nBut your abandonment issues are just that - abandonment issues you're projecting onto her unfairly (very strange to me that you still call your mother working to earn money to raise you abandonment, but that's another story I suppose).\n\nBut fundamentally you just seem to not like that she is having her party era. I get the feeling 'going out less' to you means a lot, lot less. Because you just don't think a 30 year old should be out partying. And that's not fair. \n\nHell, you go with her 1 out of 3 times. If you want to spend more time with her, organise dates that are little more party and a little less sedate, as a compromise. She simply didn't have the times that most of us had the chance to have at 18-early 20s and it's natural that she wants a little of that experience. I've known a woman who went through the same - she just needed to experience that life for a little while and get it out of her system.\n\nShe'll get over it in a while, like we all do. But in the meantime, find a middle ground and watch you're not projecting too much or getting too judgemental.", "**NAH**, asking is not an asshole thing to do, it is being a good communicator in a relationship, and her going out as she is right now is not making her an asshole..yet. If she continues and doesn\u2019t allow for a compromise between your needs and hers, she could become one.\n\nI would note that \u201cyou are too old to be doing this, and you shouldn\u2019t because you have kids\u201d are not good arguments. You should dig deeper into the ones that matter, such as \u201cwhen you do this I feel like I am not enough for you, and it makes me feel like you want a different life that I am not a part of\u201d, or whatever else is the actual truth as concerns how this affects you and your children. That is where she should be concerned, not as to whether she has reached an arbitrary age where there\u2019s an invisible rule that \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t\u201d.\n\nFocus on how her behavior affects the relationships around her, with those she presumably loves. If they are not worth making reasonable compromises for, you have your answer for how the rest of your relationship needs proceed. Alternately, if they do not negatively affect those relationships, you don\u2019t have much ground to stand on in criticizing her.", "Yea man, your wife is pretty obviously cheating on you.

At 35, she started doing the same as your wife. \n\nIt was innocuous at first- there was plenty of money, it was only on the weekends ex. Then\u2026 things spiraled fast. My dad was stressed about her being gone and doing drugs all the time- so stressed that his job performance slipped, and he went from a top performer to a name in the layoff pool. Once his salary disappeared, my step mom couldn\u2019t live of his money. Since her freind networks were full of people who partied and did drugs (and she had no skills as a SAHM), she started selling drugs to make up the difference. Then, one of her children found coke in her car and told their bio father- boom, now she\u2019s in court loosing custody (and child support). After she lost her kids, my dad divorced her. Over the course of 2 more years, she spiraled further into drugs, had a warrant out for her arrest after failing to appear in court for a drug charge,  became homeless after trying meth and getting addicted, and eventually killed herself. \n\nOP, I\u2019m not saying that this is what will happen to your wife.

Other symptoms related to this may include feelings of grandiosity, distractibility, and hypersexuality.[4] While hypomanic behavior often generates productivity and excitement, it can become troublesome if the subject engages in risky or otherwise inadvisable behaviors, and/or the symptoms manifest themselves in trouble with everyday life events.[5] When manic episodes are separated into stages of a progression according to symptomatic severity and associated features, hypomania constitutes the first stage of the syndrome, wherein the cardinal features (euphoria or heightened irritability, pressure of speech and activity, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and flight of ideas) are most plainly evident.\n\nThat description of hypomania is accurate based on my experiences...and it also sounds like every cokehead I've ever interacted with. My working theory is that neurotypical people do cocaine to experience hypomania. And hypomania will always lead to some really terrible choices.\n\nThis is the last of the diagnostic symptoms:\n\n* involvement in pleasurable activities that may have a high potential for negative psycho-social or physical consequences (e.g., the person engages in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, reckless driving, physical and verbal conflicts, foolish business investments, quitting a job to pursue some grandiose goal, etc.).[20]\n\nAnd here's the relevant part of the Wikipedia entry for cocaine:\n\n>Cocaine stimulates the reward pathway in the brain.[16] Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation.[12] Physical effects may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and dilated pupils.[12]", "I'd imagine from a dealer", "The women she is spending all this time with cannot possibly be good friends, because good friends would not be encouraging her to do cocaine! \n\nBased on what you wrote, you absolutely are trying to be a loving husband and father.

The dearth of news media coverage on this crisis is appalling. There are so many people ranging from 19-35 in my area alone who have died from unknowingly using cocaine cut with fentanyl. It\u2019s fucking terrifying and devastating. People who have partied with coke for years end up dead because, out of nowhere, their coke is poisoned. Happens to experienced users as well as first timers. It takes just one night, one \u201cbump,\u201d and you\u2019re dead. Your wife is 30 years old with a husband and children - now is not the time to be experimenting with cocaine. The risk is too great.\n\nSecond, you didn\u2019t mention anything about the current custody agreement\u2026but if there was a custody battle at any point and her ex becomes aware of her partying habits (particularly drug experimentation), he\u2019s going straight to the judge with evidence of her partying and constant absence. \n\nThird, if death and the possibility of losing her children somehow aren\u2019t enough\u2026.hello, YOU. Why isn\u2019t she saving quality time for her husband? This is fucked up. \n\nI get she wants to blow off some steam but she\u2019s acting like a fucking immature drunken college kid.

But I would like to gently urge you to go and talk to a registered psychologist who is experienced in childhood trauma, for yourself irrespective of what is happening in your marriage. \n\nQuite often, when people experience significant trauma when they are young, bad behaviour becomes normalised. We lose the boundaries of what we can allow and what we shouldn't. We find it hard to stand up for ourselves, and it's more difficult to critically analyse situations because emotions keep getting triggered and taking up space in our brains. I think I am hearing that you are not sure if you are allowed to ask your wife to stop doing something that is hurting you. You absolutely are. \n\nLet's flip this a bit. Say something awful happened to your wife years ago and she was sexually assaulted (God forbid). If that had happened and suddenly she didn't want to be intimate years later because something triggered her in the moment, would you say oh well I didn't get to have sex a lot when I was younger so that's unfair? Or even in a much less severe situation, say she had once gotten food poisoning from smoked salmon and the smell made her sick, would you eat it around her anyway because you didn't get to eat it much in the past? \n\nWhat happened to you as a child was severe. If anyone had found out they would have removed you from your mother. I note you don't talk to your mother now, you clearly find it unacceptable still. I definitely would too.\n\nNo matter what your wife is going through right now, there does seem to be an indication that something isn't quite right, she has badly let you down in this moment. I really hope that you do reach out and find good people to talk to (hopefully even a qualified one) because you are dealing with a lot right now and it can be hard to unpack as much as you seem to have to unpack right now on your own. \n\nGood luck mate. Also, you seem like a very respectful person and are giving a lot of respect and effort to your wifes feelings of wanting to recapture her youth.

I'm NOT saying what happened to her will happen here but your wife's reasoning gave me flashbacks. \n\nMy mom had me very early (she was a legal adult and she and my father are only a year apart. Nothing creepy) and then my brother 5 years later. We moved around a lot for my Dad's job. He still had to travel out of town once a month for sometimes a week, sometimes multiple weeks. Two weeks after my brother was born we moved state. The neighbor was a proud escort (told EVERYONE) and lived a \"party\" heavy lifestyle. My mom saw in the neighbor all that she had been denied by having kids and started to wild the FUCK out when my dad left for work.\n\nI was 5 when my brother was born and she began to time how long she could stay at the neighbor's house without checking in. At first it was an hour, then three, then half the night. She taught me how to feed and change him and showed me how to call next door if there was an emergency or my Dad came home unexpectedly.\n\nWhen I was 8, she started to stay away the entire time Dad was gone during school breaks. I was a \"big girl\" taking care of a toddler and she didn't have to worry about me getting to school. By this time she was heavily addicted to coke.\n\nI was 10 when she left me alone for three weeks with what food was in the cupboard and took my brother, who was now old enough to tattle. She bribed him with toys and the pool that her new friend had. I was terrified and ran out of food before she came home. I went to the neighbor's house begging for food. She figured out who my mom was with and calles her home. This wasn't the originalneighbor she had shacked up with, but another escort in her friend group. \n\nI was 12 my parents divorced. Dad took my brother, I stayed behind to care for my addicted mother. She had new dealer boyfriends weakly to supply her habit. \n\nAt 13, my brother moved back with me because he didn't like me being alone. I raised him with the money my Dad sent me through Western Union (back then, as a minor you were given a password that you could use to identify you and receive the money). Mom came home to sleep off a bender once a month, Dad came to visit for a week every 3-5 months. \n\nAt 16, mom moved in with her drug dealer boyfriend and left me and my brother in a shitty trailer in the middle of a terrible neighborhood where she owed a lot of people money. To say i thought we were going to die there is an under statement. We didn't have a phone, because no one would let her put a bill in her name, and cell phones at this time were too expensive. The only thing we had for protection was my dog. She took her to the pound after the dog tried to bite her boyfriend. \n\nAt 17, my mom essentially sold custody of us to my dad for the price of the trailer we were living in. He moved us in with my Grandmother. \n\nYour wife needs to get therapy and realize there is a healthy way to socialize. Again, my mom is the extreme end of the spectrum and I have a metric fuck ton of trauma related to her.

Maybe instead word it as spend more weekends together?\n\nTell your wife, my brother had a friend Kayla. Beautiful spirit, amazing mom.  Literally escaped in the dead of night from an abusive relationship with her 2 kids. Remarried, had 3 more kids. She partied a bit before kids but not after.  Last year she came to my brother's house to photograph his son.  She left and a friend texted her asking her to stop by and help clean out friends brothers room, as he was in the hospital or jail or something.  They came across some coke and two of them (Kayla and another) decided to do a hit for old times sake. It was fentanyl and both of them overdosed. The third friend was an EMT and had Narcan. Kayla told her to use it on the other friend. Those 5 kids lost their mom for a stupid hit of coke. The two oldest were sent back halfway across the country to their abusive father and no longer see their siblings.

I HIGHLY DOUBT that that party loving 25 year old has the wit to do that herself, and I say that as a 24 year old who's now stone cold sober after my party days in college where I realized there's far greater risk than any minimal short-lasting reward to anything happening around me. If I could turn back the clock I'd have kept my ah in the library every single night that I decided to go out to a party that's for sure.

Why are you so willing to play with your life like this like there aren't people who absolutely NEED you right now? Don't tell me anything along the lines of 'don't worry so much I have a clean supply' because there is literally no way you know that for sure.

I get she\u2019s a mother & she just wants friend & her time what she\u2019s allowing this friend of hers to influence her into doing, she may think she\u2019s being responsible but even the most responsible people who do drugs end up Overdosing.

Her situation sucks too. She wants to live the life she never could, and this shows up as a counter-attack style selfishness. It is unhealthy though, because her actions inevitably have an effect on you and the kids, and she's disregarding this.

The kids are taken care of and all good but you\u2019re not because she\u2019s out doing god knows what. \n\nYour trauma is the other big thing. It\u2019s valid how you feel but what isn\u2019t is for her to brush it off and deflect to her kids whenever you bring it up to her. If it\u2019s starting to make you feel numb, affect your mental health and bring you back to the place where all the trauma started. It\u2019s already begun to be unhealthy for you. \n\nAnother commenter said it. I\u2019d offer he an ultimatum. Stop this shit (for stated reasons) or it\u2019s over,  would be mine. Obviously you\u2019re free to choose yours if that\u2019s what you do but I wouldn\u2019t keep putting up with this. It\u2019s only gonna end bad.", "If she hasn't asked you to go with her on these outings... you're losing her.\n\nI think you have to take this seriously and ask her for marriage counselling because it's a very small step from here to divorce.

It's definitely a different type of abandonment, but if that was my wife I would kick her out...", "NTA\n\nBut I think you both need some therapy. \nYou because, I don't know when you found out or got told your mom was a stripper but due her work being basically the whole night after she put you to sleep. And then you'd wake up early and be met with silence, made it hard on you and as you said you felt abandoned while most likely (unless said otherwise I'll revoke this if so) she was working that job because she couldn't get another one out that industry and had to make ends meet to be able to take care of you. Have you talked of your feelings and trauma caused by that or just left when you could?\nNow your wife needs therapy too as you stated she got her first child at 18. That is a young age still to have children as she hasn't probably finished school yet even! At the young age of 18 she had to bare responsibility of being a mother which can be highly damaging to not only the body but mind as well. It's high likely she didn't choose to get pregnant but did choose to keep the baby. But she shouldn't be shamed for it. Now that she's going out more it's her inner teen/ young adult that is coming out to do things she couldn't do due becoming a mother at such a young age. She's going out of control of it as she's reaching on doing drugs. You need to help regulate her and help open her eyes again but without shaming her for her decisions in the past. I hope both of you can work it out together!", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is detaching from you rapidly, she loves the financial and housing support.

I also really feel for her, having had a very restrictive life (ex-cult) till I was around 30. In my experience, this won\u2019t carry on for very long, but equally, she needs to value your shared life. \n\nI\u2019d suggest to her that she goes out EITHER Friday or Saturday each week, and that you spend one whole weekend together a month. On the weekends she goes out, prioritise the rest of the time together. Say she goes out Saturday, maybe go to a late brunch or early lunch on Sunday. Say she\u2019s chosen Friday, go out for that dinner first, and plan an activity for the Sunday, and a quiet afternoon Saturday to focus on each other. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest getting to know her friend, if partying isn\u2019t your thing, maybe invite them out over to your house on one of the weekend nights instead, movies/games etc. it will give you a change to get to know them, and your wife will more than likely deepen the friendship beyond partying and want to do other activities that you might be more included on. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to find a compromise.", "NTA. But,  judging from her comment about wanting to go out,  I wondering if the alternative to going out with her friend is always a quiet night at home? Do you make plans to go out with her?

Last night, a bit before he came home, I left to my dad's place, just to rest for a while. We agreed on that a few weeks before, he knows how hard I'm working around the kids (and long distance university). The point is: I feel guilty as sin. Even though I needed this so bad, just to not be mommy for a night, I miss them and I feel guilty I'm not spending this quality time with my husband. I get that your wife's kids are bigger and not there during the weekend and that she wants some time to feel like a young woman again, but this is extreme.

Nope", "NTA. I hope you're mentally prepared to let her go if it continues on this path or gets any worse. You've acknowledged what a lot of other commenters have said and her pattern of behaviour very rarely just reverses itself.

If it was a night out every other weekend that would be one thing but almost every weekend with drug use involved would be an absolute deal breaker for me. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019ve seen this before, my older brother married his now ex wife when she was very young. He wasn\u2019t much older but she wanted to be settled down with kids at an early age so she brow beat him into marrying early. She was the very picture of the stay at home doting mother until the big 3-0 started approaching then she began going out to bars, staying out late, dressing like a stripper even to family events and eventually their marriage failed. They divorced a few years ago but neither of them has been quite right since but to much damage was done at the time to be able to repair. Unfortunately their kids bore the brunt of their behaviour as they were abandoned to my parents while I was still at home so that had a knock on effect on my 20s where instead of moving out and starting a life of my own I stayed to help support them financially as neither parent was paying anything to their care. School uniforms, shoes, glasses and food were all coming out of my retired parents pockets and devastated their finances and almost ruined mine as I didn\u2019t have the budget to support 2 hungry children. \n\nI suspect, and I say this gently, but I think your marriage is over.

What more are you willing to accept?\n\nI understand she feels she missed out because she had children young, but the key thing here is she missed out and she can\u2019t turn back that time.

Maybe the approach isn\u2019t to frame it as you being abandoned but you wanting to spend more time with her. Can you join on a night out or two? Can you ask for a big night out with her just you two? I think asking that you have an evening in together with a movie is a reasonable request too.

Of course your feelings are valid but blaming your mother leaves you at a dead end I\u2019m afraid.\n\nConsidering all that do you think the reason you don\u2019t like your wife going out is because it puts her at odds with the person you thought she was? Did you seek a relationship with your wife because she was the opposite of your mother and stayed at home with her children? \n\nI think it\u2019s impossible to distinguish whether your feelings regarding your wife are because she doesn\u2019t seemingly want to spend time with you as much as before or if it\u2019s deep rooted into the psychological damage you\u2019ve experienced from being alone as a child during the night whilst your mother worked.\n\nFor the record I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to be upset that your wife would rather be with her friends than you.

It\u2019s an outdated concept to be a SAHM, and if people really want to do that it\u2019s because they have children together and they agreed to this. \nAfter divorce this arrangement usually ends, so it baffles me why you would marry a woman that doesn\u2019t pay her own bills, will not work or do something useful (kids can\u2019t be this young if you are together for 6 years and she had them already) \n\nSo why is she acting like a college kid: nothing to do during the day and partying without having the money to do so?

I feel for both of them, but he is being taken advantage of.", "Yea, like Im 33 and I loved to go out with my friends, but if they hit me up to go out 17/24 nights until 2am, id be like, lova ya mates, but jesus christ.. this takes a lot of motivation", "My sister started like this, as soon as the kids were old enough.

Is he really \u201cinvited\u201d every time or does she just extend the invite as a formality, knowing he most probably won\u2019t come on any given time?", "Or a car comes crashing in!", "I'm sorry, that sounds horrible.\n\nBut it doesn't have anything to do with what I said. 30 is not mid-life.", "It is if you party hard enough in your 30s."]}
