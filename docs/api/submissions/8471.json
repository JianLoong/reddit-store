We have been together 6 years and married for 4.\n\nShe has two wonderful children from a previous marriage--they are with us Monday-Friday and then go with their biological father after school on Friday. I love them very much and I consider them my own children.\n\nI work a full time job as an executive in a technology company. About 50 hours per week, travel about 1 week every two months or so. My wife is a stay at home mom. She does fantastic. She had her first child at 18 and has been a stay at home mom since--this is soon to be important.\n\nRecently she met a friend who is 25, single and loves to party. And slowly but surely, my wife started to pick up on this life style. Now we're at full tilt. I took notes of the last 12 weekends just to see if I'm crazy, and I know Reddit loves good data.\n\nCounting Friday and Saturdays over the last 12 weekends includes 24 \"weekend nights,\" stretching back to the week of Halloween. Out of those 24 days she went out for 17 of them and generally does not come home until after 2 AM. She texts me generally the whole time she's out but she drinks (which is fine), smokes (not a fan of) and now has told me she has tried coke/cocaine once or twice.\n\nTime for a quick detour. Growing up I had only my mom and her \"roommates.\" My mom was a stripper--and her varying and often changing roommates were also strippers. From around the age of 8 would tuck me into bed, tell me she'd see me in the morning and then (unbeknownst to me for a long while) leave to go work at the strip club. I distinctly remember so, so, so many times waking up to find the house completely empty and eerily silent and crying myself back to sleep.\n\nAnd I was also very confused as to why my mom would do that to me, but I knew--even if I didn't know the word at the time--I was being abandoned. Eventually I became numb to it. I don't speak to my mom anymore, 24+ years later.\n\nI feel that now. Even as it's Friday and my wife is taking a nap before we go to dinner and drive separate cars so she can go hang with her friends at the bar afterwards until 2 AM. We've had it out before. I've told her I felt abandoned and her response was: \"I never got to go out. I had kids. They're with their father on the weekends so I know they're safe. I'm sorry I like to go out with my friends. I don't know what to tell you.\"\n\nI wanted to say: \"I'm sorry you had children. That was your decision. And now you're 30 (which is a bad argument, age shouldn't be a factor here but I'm winging it), and you're married and if you want to go sometimes that's fine. But I think you are going out too much.\"\n\nI'm writing this post because not only am I concerned with am I being the asshole.  \n\n\n I have my own hobbies and my own friends but I like to see my wife.

Thankfully her children have that parent to go to but if she's doing coke I can absoluetly see this going in a bad direction.  \nMaybe suggest going and seeing a therapist or marrige counciler, see if this is her way of rebelling or maybe a midlife crisis.

She's risking literally everything with her behavior.", " The real question is, why isn't she inviting you along? It's one thing to have a girl's night, even a few times a month, but this is excessive. I can't imagine being married and never going out with my spouse. You think she'd be excited about getting to have date nights with her weekends free...\n\nNTA", "I'm going with NTA.\n\nThe fact she's going out that often, experimenting with drugs, and taking no time for you both to enjoy your marriage is concerning. There's definitely nothing wrong with a girls night out or with having friends, but her patterns are getting worrisome. Cocaine is NO joke, and binge drinking can lead to alcoholism quicker than you can snap a finger. \n\nShe's trying to live out experiences she missed. I get that, BUT, there's no going back. She's married. She's a mother. You can't just jump back in time and pretend to be young and untethered. She's essentially trying to live two lives now, and there's no way they won't keep clashing. \n\nIt's time to have a serious talk with her. Even marriage counseling if she'll agree to it. That said, I would also recommend therapy for yourself as well. If this is triggering childhood trauma, you owe it to yourself to have a safe place to work through that.", "NTA. time together is important and she is making some risky decisions too.", "NTA. Might I recommend seeing a couple\u2019s therapist? It sounds like your wife never got to have fun in her 20s, so is trying to do that now. I can understand that. That being said, if it\u2019s that excessive then she really does need to slow down a little bit. Maybe try approaching the conversation by affirming and validating her- it might be more effective. Ex: \u201cI love it when you go out and have fun, and it makes me really happy to see you happy. I want you to keep doing that, but I\u2019d also like you to choose to spend a little more time with me instead of going out sometimes, since you do it so often. I miss our time together, and it\u2019s making me feel neglected. How about we have a date night every Sunday and spend time with the kids on Monday?

That\u2019s prioritising them over your shared marriage. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to be able to go out and about in this situation, but that generally is when both parties are happy with it. That isn\u2019t the case here. And normally it\u2019s not most nights. \n\nAnd she\u2019s tried coke \u2019once or twice\u2019 \u2026 how many times. Once or twice is something you\u2019d remember. I suspect it\u2019s more. She\u2019s fallen in with a party hard crowd that are probably doing more than a rare snort of coke\u2026 and she\u2019s doing this without you so clearly after you\u2019ve headed home. \n\nYou are both leading fairly different lives at the moment, and its perfectly fair for you to raise this and say \u201cthis isn\u2019t what I thought we were about\u201d and \u201cPlease can you wind it back a bit and can we have some time together.

Out all weekend, doing cocaine. Those are some serious signs.

Cocaine makes people do things they wouldn't normally do and sometimes that's with other people. She won't hit her until it's too late so I hope you two can work it out.", "NTA. There is a time and place for everything. Sadly, we all have to come to terms with the fact we've missed the window of time to experience some things and move on, adjusting our expectations. She is trying to 'have it all'. What that will do in the long run is a) lead to riskier and riskier behaviours as it's already escalating and she will eventually cheat on you, get roofied or get raped b) lead to resentment build up in from watching your partner bail on the marriage and c) cause you to divorce.\n\nWhat she's doing simply isn't fair. If she wants to continue living in a state of perpetual stunted adolescence - that's her decision. You don't have to bankroll or support that.\n\nedit: I grew up at a time and in a country when urban exploration was not a thing. You went into an abandoned building/place, you were getting raped and murdered - not necessarily in that order. Now, so many 20-somethings are doing it. I'm so jelly in my belly. I'd kill to grab a backpack and go exploring deserted, crumbling ruins from 500 - 1,000 years ago - there's plenty. But I can't and I won't. As a mother and a wife, I fully realize the ridiculous amount of risk I would take on just to satisfy a curiosity and an urge for exploration at the expense of my family's wellbeing.

She is point blank telling you that YOU are not one.  Partying and pretending she's 20, doing drugs and feeling free from all responsibilities is her priority.\n\nThere is no way that what she is doing is OK on any level.  Going out with friends and having fun is one thing.  What she is doing is quite another.  It's going to crash and burn hard and she will only have herself to blame.  There is only one way this ends, and it's badly.", "NTA\n\nAbsolute red flags here. Your wife wants to go consistently party, on your dime, without you? Once in a while is fine but every weekend for months is excessive.\n\nI\u2019d be more concerned if she is faithful or not but that\u2019s just me.

Relationships are two way streets, if she\u2019s not willing to at least hear you out then it\u2019s up to you to determine if it\u2019s worth the effort for what could be a \u2018phase\u2019 or make changes. As long as you don\u2019t try to full stop her without being reasonable you\u2019re fine.", "NTA. That would drive me crazy. Many may say that YTA because she\u2019s her own woman and can do as she pleases but I think couples have a responsibility to make each other feel cared for, and prioritised (sometimes) when it comes to friends. It\u2019s not controlling to want your wife to not act like a 21 year old party animal for the sake of her relationship", "NTA. You're married.  It's reasonable to ask your spouse to (1) spend more (not all, just more) weekend time with you than she does her \"friends,\" and (2) not drink excessively or do drugs. I get that she had kids too young and wants to reclaim some of her missed early adulthood experiences, but she's focusing on the wrong ones.  What about college, travel, etc.--things that she could either do with you or that would help fill that void more constructively?\n\nI've known people in her position.  She may just have her fill and snap out of it one day and things will be back to normal. Her friend may grow up and settle down and force an end to the crazy nights.  But there's always that possibility that she continues on this path until you don't even recognize her anymore.", "NTA and she admitted to doing drugs to boot. You have already expressed to her you dont vibe with the partying lifestyle. I dont understand why she cant cut back a bit epecially after you have expressed that you dont like it. As you have said, you arent trying to stop her just get her to cut it back a bit. I think its s smart move on your part. You arent trying to control her or who she spends time with. But you do miss spending time with her. It sounds like she is slowing morphing into someone you dont know. \n\nHow does all this partying affect her during the regular week?", "So in the past 12 weeks does she spend any significant time with you?  What are you getting from this relationship?  From what you wrote she is getting someone to pay for her and her kids during the week and for her to relive her 20\u2019s on the weekend.  This would be a deal breaker for me.", "NAH\n\nHer desire to use her free time without kids to do things she missed when she was younger is valid.\n\nYour trauma and abandonment fears are also valid.\n\nI think relationship counseling would be a good way to go in y'all's situation.  Try to frame your requests around getting what YOU need, not telling her that she is \"going out too much.\"  Too much is subjective.  It doesn't feel too much to her.\n\nLuckily, you don't need to figure out how much is too much.  You need to learn to ask for the care and attention you feel you are missing.  And she might be able to provide those things while still enjoying herself.\n\nI hope you two can learn to work together to solve this as a team.  That's what a good marriage should be able to do.  Things go through ups and downs, people grow and change, and sometimes change can be scary, especially around traumas.  Be gentle with yourself, and with her.  Maybe try going out with her sometimes?", "I think she is headed down a slippery slope and needs to reevaluate what she wants from her marriage with you. This doesn\u2019t seem much of a partnership. I hope your talk goes well. NTA", "This is a mixed bag. \n\nConcern around the smoking and the coke is valid. Wanting to have more time with her seems valid. \n\nBut your abandonment issues are just that - abandonment issues you're projecting onto her unfairly (very strange to me that you still call your mother working to earn money to raise you abandonment, but that's another story I suppose).\n\nBut fundamentally you just seem to not like that she is having her party era. I get the feeling 'going out less' to you means a lot, lot less. Because you just don't think a 30 year old should be out partying. And that's not fair. \n\nHell, you go with her 1 out of 3 times. If you want to spend more time with her, organise dates that are little more party and a little less sedate, as a compromise. She simply didn't have the times that most of us had the chance to have at 18-early 20s and it's natural that she wants a little of that experience. I've known a woman who went through the same - she just needed to experience that life for a little while and get it out of her system.\n\nShe'll get over it in a while, like we all do. But in the meantime, find a middle ground and watch you're not projecting too much or getting too judgemental.", "**NAH**, asking is not an asshole thing to do, it is being a good communicator in a relationship, and her going out as she is right now is not making her an asshole..yet. If she continues and doesn\u2019t allow for a compromise between your needs and hers, she could become one.\n\nI would note that \u201cyou are too old to be doing this, and you shouldn\u2019t because you have kids\u201d are not good arguments. You should dig deeper into the ones that matter, such as \u201cwhen you do this I feel like I am not enough for you, and it makes me feel like you want a different life that I am not a part of\u201d, or whatever else is the actual truth as concerns how this affects you and your children. That is where she should be concerned, not as to whether she has reached an arbitrary age where there\u2019s an invisible rule that \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t\u201d.\n\nFocus on how her behavior affects the relationships around her, with those she presumably loves. If they are not worth making reasonable compromises for, you have your answer for how the rest of your relationship needs proceed. Alternately, if they do not negatively affect those relationships, you don\u2019t have much ground to stand on in criticizing her.", "Yea man, your wife is pretty obviously cheating on you.

At 35, she started doing the same as your wife. \n\nIt was innocuous at first- there was plenty of money, it was only on the weekends ex. Then\u2026 things spiraled fast. My dad was stressed about her being gone and doing drugs all the time- so stressed that his job performance slipped, and he went from a top performer to a name in the layoff pool. Once his salary disappeared, my step mom couldn\u2019t live of his money. Since her freind networks were full of people who partied and did drugs (and she had no skills as a SAHM), she started selling drugs to make up the difference. Then, one of her children found coke in her car and told their bio father- boom, now she\u2019s in court loosing custody (and child support). After she lost her kids, my dad divorced her. Over the course of 2 more years, she spiraled further into drugs, had a warrant out for her arrest after failing to appear in court for a drug charge,  became homeless after trying meth and getting addicted, and eventually killed herself. \n\nOP, I\u2019m not saying that this is what will happen to your wife.

I don't want her NOT to hang with her friends, but I think she is doing so with a frequency that is detrimental to her responsibilities as a partner.", "Her friends are the ones that when you do go out on occasion, you see them at the end of the bar as the 40 year olds who never snapped out of it.\n\nThey're in their mid 20's now but make no mistake, they'll be there in 15 years too.", "She has said: \"I know how this ends. You're going to tell me I can only go out 3 days a month and when I have to tell them no I can't go out, they'll stop inviting me.\"  \n\n\nI don't want that for her--but if this continues in frequency, one day she'll come home and I won't be there.", "He said in a comment that his wife invites him every time and he goes sometimes.", "No it isn't.", "She texts me probably every 10-15 minutes and we both have our locations on (for safety), so this isn't now or ever a concern I've had.", "I never got to do meth growing up so I guess my wife should just be cool with it now, while I \u201chave some fun?\u201d \n\nStop being dumb.", "Skipping out on your kid and spouse every weekend to blow coke and get drunk is not just \"having some fun\". It's self destruction. \n\nI'm not anti partying. I help throw a music festival every year and I'm pretty involved in my local rave scene. Most of my friends are professional party goers. Doing it every weekend is a very quick way to alcoholism and addiction. Especially if you're picking it up for the first time in your 30s and trying to keep up with people younger than you.", "This is going beyond \"having some fun\", isn't it? OP can't stop her, but he is allowed to ask her to spend more time with him.", "Yeah no shit, stop working your ass off, take her out of the house once in awhile and make an effort with your realtionship.", "Are you married?\n\nIt is insane for a SO to go out and party like this a part from their other half. Once in a blue moon? Sure.\n\nEvery weekend? Insane", "If she's doing coke in 2023, she's doing meth, she just doesn't know it. Coke is stepped on a horrendous amount before it hits the US market. Meth is an easy cut that gives people a rush to make up for the shit quality. I have test kits and test for people regularly. It's bad out there.", "I work from home. I am literally home all day every day.", "I won\u2019t make it to 34. This can\u2019t continue or she\u2019s going to come home one night after a great night of fun and I\u2019ll be gone.", "So... I have to ask ... Who's picking up the bill for these evenings? That kind of sustained heavy partying isn't cheap, and that's before you throw in coke and what have you. I hate to say 'Have you checked the bank balances?', but I've been a stay at home mom, and funny thing - not a lot of disposable income in that role. Yeah, we had a very nice FAMILY income, and my husband never blinked at the credit card bill withdrawals or asked what was on them, but if they'd doubled or tripled, that would have been an issue. \n\nYou're planning for your (step) kids college funds, so I'm assuming you have some shared finances, and if so, and she's footing the bill, that's a discussion you need to have.\n\nAlso... Does she have any damn idea what happens if that coke she's tried 'once or twice' has fentinol in it? We can start with her losing custody and it gets worse from there...", "Yep, sounds like the people my mom hung around with. Ditched her the moment she couldn't pay for all their shots and cut contact as soon as she decided she didn't wanna party anymore. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can really do except offer therapy.\n\nIt took multiple rock bottoms for my mom to wake up and realize she was killing herself and making everyone around her miserable, and to this day she's still falling into those patterns even though she doesn't drink anymore. No matter how I begged and pleaded and fought with her, she said she knew what she was doing. I hope things work out for you and your wife but in the end, if it gets to the point she's putting herself in danger, you need to think about yourself and your stepchildren.", "What would happen if you invited her to nights out that were a little more tame but also fun, either as a date night or with some of your friends and their partners.  Like dinner and a show, or a local event like a fair or concert   She is clearly trying to make up she missed when she was younger, so show her some fun that doesn't involve clubbing, drinking and drugs.  Take her on a weekend adventure away from home sometimes too.  What would you both like to try doing or seeing?  \n\nIf she had her first kid at 18 and she is 30 now, it seems that both kids would be in school.  Maybe it's time she got a part time job to pay for her partying and help save for her kids college.", "She's not realizing that her patterns will absolutely bleed over into their lives, just like it already is your marriage. I'm sorry, friend. She's doing some SERIOUS deflecting.\n\nI am not a huge fan of ultimatums, but I would absolutely tell her just how much her behavior is affecting you and your traumas. I would tell her again how concerned you are. I don't want to say force her hand, but if it's this bad, you don't have to feel bad to let her know it's affecting your marriage.", "I\u2019m sorry, that sounds really hard. Maybe you could try proposing a biweekly date night on Saturday?", "I feel so sad for you being in this situation.  She should be wanting to spend time with you.  She should be missing spending time together as a couple the way you seem to be missing it. She seems to be making it clear that you're not her priority. \n\nShe's acting like your marriage can be just placed on hold while she goes out and lives out the party time that she didn't get to have.  That's not how this works.  And you deserve more respect and consideration from your partner.", "When is the last time you\u2019ve had an actual date night where there\u2019s been planned activities (beyond grabbing dinner)? Theatre, museum, etc.", "Op states wife has tried cocaine since going out with her single friend.", "Last line of the 5th paragraph of the op", "In the post it says she\u2019s tried it once or twice.", "right in the post. bout half way down.", "I\u2019m going to make the assumption that this is just a \u2018phase\u2019 honestly. She keep talking to her and if push comes to shove, offer to go with her a few times. That should nip it real quick.", "She would say: \"We are together all day through the week and during the day on the weekend,\" because she is a stay at home mom and I work from home.\n\nBut that's just it. I'm working. I don't see that as \"quality time\"", "Not that your wife is that type of girl, I don\u2019t know her, but perhaps you\u2019d feel better about it if she didn\u2019t hang out in that type of atmosphere. Amen are disgusting, and we know that because we are men\n\nMy wife gets hit on a lot when she\u2019s out, and while I trust her completely I definitely feel much happier for her when she\u2019s doing something with her friends, like a girls wine night at our house, or theirs.", "Yikes.\n\nSilver lining: in my experience, people like these cycle through friends pretty fast. Everything is superficial and they don't know how to make connections once the party stops.", "That\u2019s a sad but probably not unrealistic appraisal of the situation from both of your perspectives. It\u2019s one of those \u201ccan\u2019t have and eat the cake\u201d type of situations, and in my opinion she\u2019s in the wrong now, kind of, based on that comment.\n\nAre her friends true friends? If she\u2019s only going to be included as long as she goes along with everything uncompromisingly, she\u2019s not their friend, she\u2019s a convenient tagalong toy that will get discarded for other reasons eventually. When that eventually happens, will she have ended up having chosen transient partygoer life over her family, and will she be happy with that choice?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best choice she can make, I agree with you there, but I\u2019m at a loss for good ways to convince her that\u2019s the case.\n\nI hope you guys find a good path forward, where you can both still be happy.", "Dude read the room", "Nah dude your wife staying out getting blasted until 2 am every weekend with single girlfriends is guaranteed cheating.", "Going out drinking isn\u2019t the same as meth but nice try mate.", "She isn\u2019t skipping out on her children - they are with their father - whose not OP - on the weekends per their custody agreement.", "I omitted a paragraph where I mentioned I go out with her about every third time, so that's about 6 times every 3 months or twice a month on average.\n\nI go, I have fun, I'm usually sleepy and want to end earlier than she does, but I do go.", "I am married. It is 17 of the last 24 weekend days (Fridays/Saturdays) or an average 5 to 6 days per month.", "Then you see her every day and have opportunities spend time with her. \n\nYour complaints are invalid and feel like an excuse to complain, it's emotional manipulation. You aren't being \"neglected\".\n\nAlso, I take these kind of revelations with a grain of salt, for me personally it looks like you just deflecting.\n\nYou could have found space to add that to the body of the post, but you didn't. So I don't trust you.", "I didn\u2019t suggest that you wait another 4 years for things to change, but it sounds like it\u2019s only been a few months. \n\nDoes she have any friends in similar life places to you both? If this is the first inkling of community she\u2019s had in her life, or in the last few years, I can empathize with why she\u2019s gone headlong into this lifestyle. Might be worth finding some activities you can do together that will offer her avenues to make friends with women who aren\u2019t still in the party phase. \n\nLastly, I do think your concerns about the drug experimentation are valid, not because experimentation is inherently problematic, and despite having an experimental phase myself, I wouldn\u2019t touch drugs these days because the cross contamination is rampant now in a way it never was before. Fentanyl sneaks it\u2019s way into everything and if she\u2019s not experienced, she wouldn\u2019t know that. \n\nThat\u2019s the conversation to have. Yes, her children are safe, but they also need a mother to come home to. But you know, be compassionate in the course of this conversation. It\u2019s going to be a tough one.", "I agree with you--I am of the mind (not sure how my wife feels) that if it gets to the ultimatum stage then something has seriously gone awry.", "This one made me very sad. Mostly because I think it\u2019s true.", "I try and ask her if she wants to do stuff but she\u2019ll say \u201cOh I was going to grab dinner with such and such on Friday. We can do something Saturday morning!\u201d", "I wouldn't, either. I feel for you. I'd be just as hurt if my partner was doing this. What does she say when you ask her to, say, go to dinner with you on a Saturday night?", "Or don't automatically jump to cheating? Why would she offer every time? Especially when he takes her up on that offer a fair amount?", "Just because you can't imagine going out with single friends without cheating on your partner doesn't mean other people don't.", "Coke is though", "You just haven\u2019t tried the right meth then. You should have some fun in life.", "\ud83d\ude44 you're right, I was typing too fast. That totally means she's immune from becoming an addict. And I'm sure that by Sunday night when the kids come home, she's definitely fully recovered from her Saturday night bender. And all the meth, levamisole, raw lidocaine, and fentanyl that coke is cut with today is probably cool because she's just \"having fun for once\" which obviously means it's not ripping her body apart.", "Do some coke too \ud83e\udd23", "The post was 2900 characters, I cut it down. I am working 8 to 6 Monday-Friday so I see her sparingly in between calls/meetings/etc.", "It already has. Your wife doesn\u2019t see you as a reason to stay home. She doesn\u2019t value spending time with you and explicitly would rather party with friends unless her kids are around.", "Wishing you the very best here! You sound like a good husband and human. I hope you two can work this out.", "I wish I had some words of wisdom,  but I don't.  I hope things will work out for you.", "\"Yeah, absolutely, let's go to dinner. We should drive separate cars because I'll probably want to meet up with so and so after for drinks.\"", "She's going out with single girlfriends getting blasted until 2am both nights almost every weekend. Like come on my guy", "Meth is much worse than coke. And she\u2019s tried it a grand total of twice - that\u2019s is just experimenting. She continues that\u2019s a different situation. \n\nRight now tho, it really just sounds like she\u2019s enjoying what she never got to enjoy because she had kids at 18. It\u2019s a phase, she\u2019ll move past it. OP can probably join her out - I\u2019m guessing due to his work schedule he doesn\u2019t want to - therefor he needs to have an actual sit down about couple time.", "And her husband routinely lol"]}
