It is weaponised incompetence.\nI have huge driving anxiety to the point I have a panic attack almost every time I have to drive, thus leaving it to my husband, but in the event I absolutely have to drive because he is too unwell to and I have enough time to prepare myself, I suck it up and do it. If I had to get to work and it was the only way I could do it, I would have to deal.
