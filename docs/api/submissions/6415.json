I was so excited and couldn\u2019t wait to get my license. What happens if you can\u2019t drive and have an emergency? What happens if your child has a non-life threatening emergency and you aren\u2019t there? If you are in the US, ambulances are extremely expensive. Some things happen that you need to go to a hospital but aren\u2019t urgent enough to call the ambulance.  What then? Waiting on Ubers all the time? That is costly and not always time efficient in an emergency.  \n\nAre you going to drive your child everywhere they need to go forever? What about more children? Will you have the time to run them all around? \n\nPeople who can\u2019t drive need to think before having children. Too many variables that could happen for me to be ok with having a partner that wouldn\u2019t learn to drive. If she had a disability, that would be excusable.", "I don\u2019t see references to Murder, She Wrote often enough in daily life. Thank you for bringing a smile to my face!", "That\u2019s me.

It has nothing to do with ability, my delays have been 50% anxiety 50% guilt. Im piss myself terrified if how bad folks are on the road, im equally uncomfortable with the condition of roads in my area. I would honestly rather walk the 5 miles to the pharmacy than drive there. And for the guilt part, in this 5mi instance I cannot wrap my head around burning gas, adding miles and wear to a vehicle, and being seated the whole time when I can just walk.", "Literally you wrote what I was about to write! I miss murder she wrote.", "When I was 16 I was in an accident while in the front passenger seat where a woman just ran a red light in the middle of the day and t-boned the passenger side of the car.  Luckily everyone walked away largely uninjured but just seeing her coming straight at me and knowing I couldn't do anything and that my life might be over or severely changed in the next couple seconds stuck with me.\n\nSo I have a lot of driving anxiety too.  The knowledge of how quickly something can happen if even just one person around you has a moment of distraction, no matter how good or safe of a driver you are is tough to overcome.\n\nBut I also just got my full license finally at 29 so yay us!", "I love driving, and if I offer someone a ride because I'm able to, we always vibe out to some loud music or have a nice convo.

Plus most of them shut down in the middle of the night, so have fun taking an Uber to the hospital, because the ambulances are privately owned and probably do not take your insurance anyway.\n\nHell, even Seattle is *just* talking about expanding its largely single trolley system as of the end of last year 2022. Not that they're fixing how the trolley and ferries do not actually touch, and you have to walk a minimum of a half mile between the two, which is a nightmare for any but the most athletic. Walking up the hills is awful; I cannot imagine how difficult it would be in a wheelchair.\n\nThe US is an absolute nightmare.", "OP mentioned that she also refuses to use public transportation.", "the US doesn't really \\*have\\* a 'public transportation system'.  Sure the urban areas may have busses and  trains, but they're usually only in limited areas, run limited routes, and only post the schedules on-line.  \n\nThe majority of us don't even have that.", "1 mile?
