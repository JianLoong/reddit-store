One of those schools being in the city my partner and I live in\u2026She called and ask me if she went with school A could she possibly move in with me (30 Female) and my wife Carly (33 F) I said let me talk to Carly and I will let you know. Little sister said hey I can pay you guys some rent, $300 if that\u2019s okay. I said that sounds completely doable but again let me talk to Carly . Carly said of course she could move in and she\u2019ll be paying rent so why not. After little sister officially moved in she told me \u201c look mom is pissed that you are making me pay rent so please don\u2019t feed into it and just ignore her I\u2019ll get you my portion as soon as my loan hits I just don\u2019t want you to be blindsided if she says something to you.\u201d I know I wasn\u2019t the easiest kid, I was \u201cbad\u201d I partied hard my last 2 years in high school all the way through college, I was terrible with my money but I always made sure everything was paid because I didn\u2019t want my stuff to be taken from me. Small run down of my parents/life growing up\u2014My mom cares 100% about how she looks in our community because we are from a very small town. My dad was the town drunk, he would physically and verbal abuse us but behind close doors of course. I moved out when I was 16 to live with family because I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore (hints the partying in high school) I met my wife and got my life in order, now my wife and I are finally in a good spot in life, but the reason we don\u2019t have a child or even though about adopting one is because we literally can not afford to feed 3 mouths. But now Carly is upset that my mom is saying what she\u2019s saying about my little sister paying rent so she got a 2nd job, and little sister has yet to pay me rent and her loan has already hit\u2026.my parents are coming in to talk to us about why little sister is paying rent. Carly told me to stand my ground and let them know they didn\u2019t raise freeloaders, things don\u2019t come free in life especially to little sister because she got into law school that means we should just bust our asses for her?

Full stop. End of story.", "NTA...Your sister is an adult. Housing costs are a part of adult life.  There's no reason on earth that she shouldn't have to contribute to the household financially.", "NTA I can almost guarantee your little sister would be paying way more than $300 for rent anywhere and probably have to live with roommates which can be a big hit or miss.", "NTA and the whole family drama backstory shows there's a general lack of boundaries. It's none of their business how you \"look\" to the community. Take the modest rent money and continue to support your sister. And Carly sounds awesome! Listen to her!!\n\nEdited to add: set up a lease agreement with your sister so it's in writing in, and you are all our clear on the obligations.", "A 26 year old should pay their own way, it\u2019s ridiculous to expect otherwise. Your mother can kick rocks.", "NTA! Jesus, she's 26, not 16. You two made your own agreement. Why are your parents even needing to come and talk in person about this? NTA at all.", "NTA, it's your home that you share with your wife. You have no obligation to house your sister for free. Not to mention you can't afford to, and your sister offered to pay rent without you even asking. Tell your mother it's none of her business, and she can pay for her housing costs if it's that big of a deal to her.", "NTA - this is a case for strong boundaries with the mother.   \n\n\nFirst of all - it is incredibly generous to take your sibling in for only 300$ while she studies! This decision is only for you and your wife to make. If your sister is okay with this arrangement then you are good to go.   \n\n\nParents love to butt in and it seems there is some history there, all of that aside, you are grown, independent and that old life is behind you. Make that decision to put it behind you too and move on for yourself. If your mother brings it up a lot, make it a boundary, and tell her to move on too. High school was a lifetime ago for you. And don't discuss the living arrangement in detail with your mother. Her opinions are her own but the decision is solely between you and your wife plus your sister. Shut down any future comments with a simple: \"we already sorted it between us, lets move on\" and change the subject. You got this!", "NTA little sister offered to pay rent, you made that part of this deal. Your mom needs to accept she\u2019s not apart of this conversation. Set a date, like the 1st, and tell your sister she needs to pay that day. I\u2019d be furious if my SO got a second job because my sibling wasn\u2019t paying their part (which realistically doesn\u2019t even cover everything she\u2019s using and eating). This can and probably will be detrimental to your marriage if this doesn\u2019t get sorted asap", "NTA adults have to pay for their room and board.", "NTA", "It makes sense that your sister pay something.  There is a cost to you if she lives with you.\n\nShe will be using utilities at the very least.

Stand your ground.\n\nNTA", "The second I read that Carly said she would pay rent, I knew she wouldn't. Family never pays.\n\nYou are being played.

You have a right to charge rent. Apparently your sister can afford it and pay it. Your mom is the problem. I have two thoughts. Remind your sister that she owes the rent as she has gotten her loan. I suspect she is getting pressure from your mom not to pay. Two, tell your mom there will be no \"talk\". You have worked out a satisfactory deal with your sister---an agreement between two functional adults---and you will NOT be having any family meetings to discuss it further. Your partner is right. Stick to your guns. You are NOT being unreasonable.", "NAH between you and your sister. She literally agreed to pay rent. Dunno why you dropped the \"she's yet to pay rent\" when she's told you that she will as soon as the loan hits and it presumably hasn't yet (because it's the beginning of August after all!) \n\nYou all agreed to ignore your mom, who is not even a part of this agreement, so just do that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
