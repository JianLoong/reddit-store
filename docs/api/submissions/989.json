You should be able to ask not to get pranked on your birthday. If your partner isn\u2019t doing that then they are an asshole. NTA.", "NTA it\u2019s your bday and sometimes pranks can get very annoying", "Nta. I may be a little biased because I think it\u2019s an all around ridiculous holiday, but just explain your feelings on it when the time comes and that you would prefer it not take place. What you\u2019re asking for is reasonable. Who wants all of that done on their birthday? It\u2019s not common place to give someone else an empty box on the one day a year that someone is supposed to be celebrated.", "NTA \n\nYour birthday should be your birthday and if you don't want to be pranked that's fair.", "NTA, but I think you'll only get a temporary reprieve. \n\nOnce the child is old enough to pay attention to TV, they'll likely hear about April Fool's Day. They are certain to hear about it when they start school. Kids love jokes and pranks. A joke about, or a prank on, a parent is irresistible.", "NTA\n\nI have a sister with your birthday and we always had a policy of other tricks were okay, but nothing to the birthday girl. I think it's okay to set this limit.", "Nta, my husband is born on April 1st. Our kids are 8 and 4. They know what April fools day is and do little silly things with friends or at school.  But at home we don\u2019t really participate in it. It\u2019s more today is daddy\u2019s bday let\u2019s make a cake, what balloon do you think daddy would like, let\u2019s wrap a present etc.", "NTA- pranks almost universally suck", "YWNBTA\n\nBut here's what I would do:  About a month or so before your birthday, let everyone know that starting this year, you do NOT want any more pranks or gag gifts for your birthday. Be firm. Tell them that enough is enough and to please stop. If someone does it anyway, I would get up without saying a word, leave the room, then block them or whatever I have to do in order to get my point across that I will not tolerate it anymore. Afraid of someone calling me a bad name or making fun of my reaction? No. I'd be proud of myself for finally growing a spine and standing up for myself! You often have to be your own advocate and stand up for yourself because no one else will. And that goes for your children, as well. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming baby!!", "NTA. Not many people even celebrate April Fools to begin with, and it sucks that your birthday is overlooked for something silly and is turned into a joke. But be sure to communicate with your future husband about it first so he knows too.", "NTA - it's totally reasonable to not want to be pranked ~~ever~~ on your birthday. \n\nAnd if you're concerned that your kids will feel like they're really missing out by not participating in April Fool's Day, you can replace it with something sweet and silly! Like making  silly snacks (chocolate pudding cups with crushed oreo \"dirt\" and gummy worms), family game night or watching funny movies.", "NTA for not wanting to deal with that bs. It's disrespectful and not even close to being funny.\nYou are the asshole to yourself, though, for not standing up for yourself and not doing the same things to the people that do that to you, no matter what day their birthday is (or any other holiday that involves gifts).", "NTA. Set those boundaries.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to ban pranks on your birthday.  If there are people in your life who make your birthday miserable, they shouldn\u2019t be in your life.   You should sit them down and communicate how bad it makes you feel.  If they don\u2019t get it, they don\u2019t get to be part of your birthday and can f all the way off.  NTA.", "I didn't really think April fool's was a thing outside of school, you're NTA at all but I would be surprised if it even came up. Does your partner play pranks on you a lot?", "Honestly you can just \u201cmove\u201d your birthday. I had a friend born on 9/11 she \u201cchanged\u201d her birthday to 9/9 sure her id still says 9/11 and that\u2019s what am she puts on official forms but we all celebrate her birthday with her on 9/9. My grandpa was born on Christmas so he celebrated his half birthday instead of his birthday because he never got one as a kid. Theres nothing wrong with celebrating on a different day. It\u2019s easier to change the day than change peoples reaction to it. My friend born on 9/11 felt guilty celebrating her birthday for years. Changing the date made her much much happier.", "NTA\n\nIt was never a thing in my family.   Sure I learned what it was, but I never got into pulling pranks.   Talk to your husband about it and see if the two of you can agree that April Fools pranks aren't allowed in the house or toward family.", "NTA for creating other family traditions that do not center on pranks. The key is to replace it with better traditions before they are exposed to traditional April 1 pranks. And when your kid inevitably asks you tell them that because your birthday is April 1 you are the Grand Prankster and it would be inappropriate for people to prank you on your birthday.", "No but take the time to explain why it would hurt you. Or perhaps teach them that they are allowed to prank you as long as it's nothing connected to your birthday.", "NTA, but foolishly optimistic at the same time.", "You don\u2019t need to make a BAN in order to feel respected on your birthday. This warrants a convo with your partner about you feeling a lack or respect, lack of love, effort, and attention on your birthday because of the pranks. It warrants you saying how it effects you and having an open and honest conversation. I never grew up with any april fools traditions, pranks weren\u2019t a thing in my house, we don\u2019t even pay attention to the day. Just raise your kid to ignore it rather than banning something and making them feel like their missing out. YWBTA", "Nta, April Fools Day is only a fun holiday if everyone enjoys it. Otherwise it's a drag.", "NTA\nToo many pranks are just cruel anyway. Why not focus on banishing the bad (mean pranks and comments; great time to also discuss bullying) and enjoy the good (puns, yummy food, whatever traditions you would have liked to have on your birthday).", "My Dad\u2019s birthday was April 1. In his 85 years of life not a single family member even thought of playing a prank. You have been around some toxic people over the years. To think that you even need to consider the future is in my POV weird. NTA by any means.", "NAH There is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. You did your time, there is no reason to do it again.", "YWBTA if you ban your husband and child from doing them to each other.  It is fine to say you will not tolerate any pranks to you for or on your birthday.", "NTA. You will soon learn a valuable lesson about what it's like to push a rope.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're going to deny your kids part of pop culture because of your personal insecurities? I don't think you'd be asking if you didn't already have the inclination. You are not going to be able to avoid this your whole life, even if your kids abide. Your reaction to it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.", "Mild YTA\n\nBanning April Fools from your kids will remove a small amount of joy from their lives.  It would be reasonable to enforce a no birthday pranks on you rule", "In my house, moms are immune to such things as \u201cjinx!\u201d and \u201cOpposite Day.\u201d  I decided that those were two childhood traditions I longer wanted any part of.  I have fun with my children in other ways.  \n\nP.s. - NTA!", "I think there has to be a middle ground. Either ban pranks just for the birthday party / dinner part of the day and allow kids free rein the rest of the day.

Anything that has the joke immediately gets thrown in the trash. If anyone makes a fuss, tell them you\u2019re just putting the jokes where they belong.", "Honestly I don't think it would be hard to just raise the kids to think of that day as just a birthday, just like they have birthdays. I only recall April Fools being a thing in elementary school, when I was like... 7 years old. I didn't really know about it before then and didn't bother with it after.  \n\n\nJust treat it like a regular birthday just like theirs, and when they eventually do learn about the other meaning, just sit down and explain to them that you do not celebrate that 'holiday' and would appreciate it if they would respect your boundaries. As long as you have raised them to respect that different people have different traditions and different boundaries, hopefully that should be sufficient.", "Love the satire buddy", "April fools day isn\u2019t a real holiday. It is more like a tradition in certain house holds. I even googled it to make sure I wasn\u2019t spreading lies. But it is more of a tradition for people who choose to participate. They can play pranks literally any day of the year. There doesn\u2019t have to be a whole specific day devoted to it. They are allowed to ask for them not to happen on their birthday.", "But if one were to do that, how would one regift them back to the giver?", "Good question!!", "While I like the idea of garbage right infront of them, I like the idea of giving things like that back...(revenge best served cold & all that) they'd be lucky I'd not fill it w glitter...", "Oooooohhh!!! Nice!! lol"]}
