All month long Mil(Unsure of age f) had been preaching about how there should be no secrets in her household and how her house has an open discussion policy, primarily when I tried to get Bil and Sil to stop reporting everything my fianc\u00e9 and I did and said to her. Well, the night before my last night there, Mil pulled my fianc\u00e9 into her bedroom to \u201ctalk privately\u201d. I had a bad feeling as Mil had been rather competitive with me all day that day so I decided to eavesdrop. I could hear her trying to convince my fianc\u00e9 that I was pushy and that his relationship with me wasn\u2019t healthy and to his credit, he adamantly defended me. Mil then suddenly threw the door open and caught me eavesdropping. She attempted to call me out for being rude but I just smirked and said: \u201cI thought this was an open household where no secrets were kept.\u201d She just shook her head and left the room. Fianc\u00e9 demanded to know what I was doing and I informed him that I didn\u2019t trust Mil and I was right. He said that I needed to stop viewing his mother as the bad guy and when I asked how else I was supposed to view her? He said like a mother trying to protect her children. We got into another bad fight and he said some really below the belt things that I\u2019m having a hard time shaking off even though he tearfully apologized to me the next day.

Your MIL can say or do anything, and it'll be excused as simply a mother protecting her child.  The fact that your, hopefully ex, fianc\u00e9 sees this as normal and praise-worthy us a huge red flag.  \n\nAnd for those criticizing you for eaves dropping, ignore them.  Your self protective instincts told you you were being attacked. Of course you listened.  Your analysis of your MIL was accurate, and you learned something new about your bf. \n\nYou spent a month in a hostile environment.

If someone else is an AH for doing something to you, then you're an AH for doing it back to them.", "NTA - I would move out. This whole situation is toxic, clearly staying with the inlaws isn't working as he is acting as a Son first and a partner second. I would also reconsider marrying him as he's putting his mother first. That will be the rest of your life.", "ESH - If you have to resort to eavesdropping, it may be time to rethink the relationship. At the very least, you need to get out of MIL's house.

Having a private discussion is not keeping secrets.

Your mother is right.", "Did you look at her post history? she is the hostile and toxic one.", "The usual reddit misandry", "Read her post history. It's so extremely toxic.\n\nTLDR: she gave her 12yo sil the sex talk after she scolded her for trying to get her attention when she was trying to have sex with her boyfriend and doesn't do any chores and complains about everything despite not having a job.", "Yeah. I\u2019m curious about this too.", "Well, when she constantly threatens her sil and makes her uncomfortable.

OP needs to talk to her husband about how MIL doesn't respect boundaries.", "So fiance can say whatever below the belt thing he wants, but she can't listen at the door to MIL badmouthing her to him?", "OP is very clearly following the rules that MIL has presented?

Else why get married?\n\nOP could just as easily called MIL out without listening at the door. Taking her fianc\u00e9 aside privately is a obvious breach of the \"no secrets in her household\" policy that didn't require eavesdropping.", "Especially when OP has bullied the sil and sexually harassed her multiple times.

Also a mother has every right to address her concern with her child, no matter what they might be, in confidence when in HER OWN HOUSE!", "Not getting along with MIL = quick break up with that dude\n\nWhen the dude did defend her when she was eavesdropping. \n\nYou expect someone to say \"yes my mother who took care of me since I was a toddler doesnt like you I'll go no contact sweetie no worries\"\n\nHe just tried to make her understand thzt his mom isnt a bad person she's just worried for him \n\nHe's just trying to do damage control because he cares about his girlfriend  and his mother. \n\nIf he didnt defend her that would have been an actual red flag. But he did, and without even knowing she was listening.\n\n\nIts like when you have two friends who hate each other, its tough man. You cant always make things go right if the two dont patch things up on their own. Blaming the person in the crossfire is dumb\n\n\nSo yes jumping to \"break up\"  is the usual reddit misandry. Every single post where a dude does anything there's \"break up\" in the comments. I dont know if you're all single and jealous or if you're just looking for unicorns but you need to calm down on the sexism.\n\n\n\n\nA boyfriend/girlfriend who defends you when alone with his parentd is a big green flag.\n\nAnd if he didnt try to do damage control and just said his mother is mean he'd be two faced and thats bad.

And nowhere did he ask his mom to \"protect him\" she just does it because she is a mother and looking out for their children is what parents do.\n\n\nAbsolutely nowhere in the post was it even implied that he needed his mother to protect him.\n\nYou're just being sexist and blaming the mother's out of line behaviour on the dude. You cant control your parents behaviour and he did defend her so idk whats your problem.", "What could OP possibly think is something below the belt that would make fianc\u00e9 cry apologizing that wouldn't make the fianc\u00e9 an AH?", "Clearly you\u2019ve never been around in laws who feel the need to \u2018talk in another room\u2019.", "Clearly you need to tone down on misandry.\n\nUnless the boyfriend can mindcontrol his mother he is clearly not at fault.

The mil is the problem.", "You were saying it isnt misandry.\n\nWhen thr post i was answering to blamed the dude for beef between the gf and MIL and just went break up already"]}
