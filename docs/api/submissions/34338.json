They grow, move on, are successful....The golden child either \"fails to launch\" can't keep a job, parents are old, etc. Parents then demand the unfavored child to take care of the golden child, who is 40, living at home with no job, because no one treats them right, games all day and in debt up to their eyeballs. Do what you need to do, get a PO box number, lock everything down with college, social media, anything you can think of.
