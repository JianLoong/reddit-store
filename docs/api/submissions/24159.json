Get what's left into an account she has access to and after that tell her she needs to pay you back for the money she took without permission.\n\n Remind her its theft if you need to. Also, I don't feel like you have to do this in private. She's behaved outrageously and you are entitled to escalate up to outrageously too.", "Your grandmother made this account for you, not for your mother. She stole from you and is calling you greedy and ungrateful to be sure you won't go to the police or to your grandma. Honestly, do both.

She's the greedy one, not you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and if was left on trust.for you, she could be legally obliged to preserve it for you.

She has stolen it - if she refuses to return it.\n\nYoru mother isn't destitute, trying to save the roof over her head with toddlers, or in need of life saving surgery when she stole this money - she has a well paying job, she can return it- she just doesnt want to - she probably thinks its from her mum so it should be hers.\n\nTell your grandmother - out her to the whole family.\n\nAlso did how did she access the money - you are 18 not a child anymore - why don't you have an account that only you can access? \n\nGo to your grandmother to get her to demand the money back - since it came from her she will be furious her daughter stole it. Today go close that bank account and go to a different bank altogether and open a bank account and transfer the rest of the 4K there. Whislt you are at it - take all your important documents - birth certificate etc and keep possession of them or give them to your grandmother to store instead.", "NTA\n\nShe is definitely spending the money on something shady", "NTA your mother stole your money and used DARVO (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender) to manipulate you into thinking she is the victim here.", "She took over half. That\u2019s fucked up.", "NTA, that money was rightfully yours and she stole it from you.", "NTA. Get your own account ASAP and inform your grandmother.  Also, 6k is a big enough sum that it's worth seeking legal advice for. Your grandmother might have resources to get an attorney. Good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
