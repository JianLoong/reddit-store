A sympathetic daughter worrying about her mother's money troubles.", "Car stuff can get expensive really, really quickly, depending on what needs to be done or what goes wrong. That being said, OP,  you are absolutely NTA. If she was borrowing this money from a peer, they'd expect to be paid back, right? To borrow it from your own kid and call them \"greedy and ungrateful\" when they ask for recompense is screwed up.", "Uh, no.  You are not greedy because you want what she took from you.  Something that your grandmother saved up for you for years.  Nope.\n\nNTA  Whose name is this account in?", "NTA. Since you are not yet 18 and can't open your own account, have you told your grandmother?", "Your mom is THA .  Tell your grandmother now!  If you can, get your mom's name off the account, now.  She can't be trusted.  You are not greedy, mom is.", "YTA. Consider it all the headaches you put her through .", "You should talk to a lawyer. Your mom's behaviour is unacceptable", "NTA  \n\n\nTell your grandmother. Contact the bank. Check how your mother was able to access your mother.", "Nta. I would have told her she needs to ask grandma before she borrows anything (& sign a promissory note). Its not your job to pay for her car. She could buy a decent car for 6k so unless its a really nice, expensive or new car, i wouldn't trust that she paid it anyway. The fact she is trying to weedle you out of over half the money, without paying it back, says so much abt her. Your just turning 18, thats big money when your starting out. You sound like a good kid, she should want you to have an easier path, not take what she can get. Please don't give it to her. Good luck & happy birthday", "NTA. Do not give it to her because you will never see it again. Your grandmother is gifting it to you not your mother.", "NTA get that money back", "I'm sorry OP but\n\nI think your mom spent the money. Ask to look at the bank statements.", "NTA. If you're sure your mom does not need it, then it can be a controlling thing. She'll take money out and out in order to not let a young person with a big sum.\nTalk with your dad AND your grandma", "NTA.\n\nI'm pretty sure unless the car is exotic nothing would cost $6K. Like at that point by a new (used) Car.\n\nIt sounds like your mom just wanted the money for herself. You might want to tell your grandma.", "NTA!!! if she isn't the holder of the bank account, shouldn't it technically qualify as theft?", "Wow. These comments...\n\nFrankly INFO. \n\nOn the surface your argument and assertion seem justified. But there's WAY too much info we don't have in order to properly assess. Clearly you're very young and as such lack life skills/experience to be anything remotely partial. Your comment regarding how Dad has always paid for everything while being judgemental towards your Mom is also very suspect. I'm assuming they are divorced and you've lived with your Mom? Again, way too much we don't know regarding the entire situation. There are plenty of circumstances and situations in which I might understand your Mom's decision making. AND as a teenager your interpretation of her \"reasoning\" or explanation could be completely wrong. No offense to you but I always think the adult/parent should be heard before passing judgement in these situations.", "Every time a post comes up involving a minor and a bank account with missing money because of parents, the more I begin to think banks need to have a policy in place that allows minors to have an account but have to jump through hoops to withdraw money.", "Different bank.  Way too many stories about banks letting parents at their children's account after enough bullying.", "If OP's grandmother meant for the mom to use the money to pay bills with, she would've given the mom money directly. \n\nThe mother took it upon herself to withdraw money not intentioned for her. That is stealing. \n\nTaking care of minor children that you have produced and birthed isn't an accomplishment or deserving of some kickback...it's your obligation to your child and humanity.", "I wouldn\u2019t wait till you get the money. Set it up now so it\u2019s private to you only.", "You should really talk to your grandmother if you haven't already. I doubt that she would be happy to hear that the gift money was stolen", ">If OP's grandmother meant for the mom to use the money to pay bills with, she would've given the mom money directly. \n\nYou raise a good point. \n\nBut consider this. Under what situation would you, a rational person, take 6000 from your child to pay for car troubles? Try taking the mother's perspective in this. I would probably have to have extremely limited options to do such a thing.\n\nIt's easy to demonize the mother but it could have been emergency.\n\nSecondly, we're only hearing one side of this. I assume your an adult. On average who tends to make more mature decisions? An 18 year old that's recently out of highschool or a 40-something year old that has a decent paying and stable job? I do think there is more to this story.", "...remind her of the $6000 she already OWES you. \n\nnta", "That's not entirely accurate. Parents have custodial control over gifts from other people and similar possessions in a similar way to that someone in charge of a trust might have over the trust.\n\n\nIt might rarely result in criminal charges but depending on how well documented things are a judge in a civil suit could absolutely look at a well to do parent stealing six grand and order them to pay it back because the parent in question was not acting in good faith for their child's best interest. (Versus a low income parent using money to pay rent or buy a new car so they can continue to get to work - both of with are in the child's best interest)", "I that case I would ask the grandmother to hold off till she is 18 and has set up a bank account.", "Tell your dad what she did -Im surw she\u2019ll love that lool", "I do wonder if grandmother is still alive or not. Doesnt seem like the mum would do this if so", "NTA: your mother has enough money. Why deos she need yours, especially without giving context.", "NTA. Explain to grandmother and father what is happening and demand your bank account. Your mother is behaving with obnoxious greed and is out of line.", "Missing some INFO here. Is your grandmother still alive? Are you 18 yet? If no to both, what is the arrangement? Is the account held in escrow for you?\n\nTo clarify, it sounds like NTA, but this kind of stuff can get tricky legal-wise.", "NTA, and what your mother did was theft, straight up. As in you can get the police involved and get the courts to return the money.\n\nNow I don't know if going that far is a good idea (likely not!) but unless there are unmentioned details here a parent does not get to help themselves to their child's property.", "Is your Grandma still around? If so, she might be interested to know that Mom decided 6 k of your money belonged to her. If not, and if you're under 18, you could go to the bank and explain what has happened to a manager. Ask that a withdrawal hold be placed on the account until your 18th bday. Set an appointment for that day to open your own account and transfer the remaining balance in and close the joint account. \n\nSeparately, google \"family loan agreement\" and print one, fill it out and show it to your mother. Make it clear that her deduction of 6 k from your account (she was simply on the account as a guardian, not as an owner) will be treated as a loan. You can agree on a repayment plan for the balance, you can even cut her a break and not charge interest. I would also mention that she can repay you for the loan by paying for upcoming expenses that you will have- tuition, down payment on your own car, etc. \n\nShe probably won't repay you, she'll probably be angry, but it will feel really good to stand up for yourself. And I doubt this is what your Grandma wanted for you. Good luck.", "NTA, not greedy, not ungrateful. Mom is a thief. Car stuff? ...or gambling, drugs?", "NTA\n\nTheft is theft.\n\nI have a savings for my kid.  Taking money from it would be embarrassing and messed up. \n\nShe is entitled.", "NTA. Your mother stole from you. She can put it back or talk to the cops.", "You need to tell your grandmother! She would want to know, trust me. My father did things like this and I never told, I wish I did. That money is for YOU.", "Tell grandma. Tell dad. Tell mom, she needs to pay you back and put in a payment plan.", "Every time I hear someone say this, it absolutely horrifies me that banks allow this to happen. I've never trusted my mom enough to have her on an account, but she absolutely, 1000% would have wheedled her way into a new account if I'd ever had her on one and I'm naive enough that I would have thought a completely new account would be safe.", "Or she might be financially irresponsible and/or on drugs. When did she suddenly need 6K for car trouble and what kind of car trouble costs that much? That sounds exactly like an excuse a junkie would use. \n\nIt doesn't matter who is older or younger...the money was NOT the mother's to do with as she pleased.", "Tell your dad about this now. I'm assuming your grandma has passed since you said 'had been putting money into the account' but if not, certainly tell her too. Your mother may need an adult to apply pressure to make her do the right thing here. NTA", "Can you ask your grandmother to remove it?", "NTA and do NOT wait to find out. Call your grandmother NOW. If she knowingly allowed your mom to dip into those funds that's one thing. It would suck but that's her call. If not, your mother stole from you AND her and you will likely need grandmoms backing on what to do next. Even if that means grandma sues your mom.", "I wondered about that because I've had my own bank account since I started working at 17 in Canada but I thought maybe it was 16 here.\n\nMy mom's a gambling addict and there's no way in hell I'd ever have added her to my bank account.", "Why play word games?  Just directly ask her if mom had permission to access and use those funds. I'm betting not or there was some agreement in which the mom lied to a agreement to reimburse it.", "Should do that anyway and still expect the full $6K", "NTA.
