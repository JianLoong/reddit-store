Linda helped me 2 yrs ago when she offered me I could move to her city and share a one bedroom apt with her for 2 mths til her lease is finished and then we could find something larger together. I found a good job in her city and took her up that offer. Mind you, Linda had 2 large dogs in that flat with her. So for two months, we all lived  there.\n\nI loved her dogs and valued her making room for me and helping me out that way.We found a larger apt and moved there together (separate rooms) and went halfsies on everything.\n\nOne of the dogs bit me in the face, I got stitches(the dog didnt have his vax done and i lied to the doctors that i was my vaxxed dog to protect her),it took 3 months of me begging her to have them vaxxed.\n\nI like to clean when Im home alone and I dont like to point out what i had cleaned, which was something she did and told everyone she is the ONLY one cleaning the flat..Which was not true but if you dont brag about it then it wasnt done i guess.. i tried to discuss the small things but she would get upset and i felt bad because she had helped me out so much.\n\nMonths later, she lashed out at me about me taking a book from her room (it was on the table, she had her doors open and it was a book we had together), and made a point of how she would never dare to enter my room without my permission and it got to the point she had moved out. I had to change jobs so I can afford to pay rent by myself, was newly diagnosed with ADD and lost my best friend all at once.\n\nI started talking to a guy through a dating app, then on socials and then he told me he knows the dog from my pics and somehow told me he had had sex with Linda **IN MY BED** when I was away a month after we had moved to the flat. (she had an elevated floor in her room basically having the bed a meter from the ceiling-so impractical) I wouldnt mind her doing it in my bed that much as long as I was aware and if she had **CHANGED THE SHEETS**. Also, I used to go away often and she changed partners VERY OFTEN. so who knows how many people she slept with there and arranged it so I didnt know. I was disgusted by the thought of that and I messaged her what a hypocrite she is making a deal out of a book while she was doing that. Didnt get a response so I posted something along the lines of \"if you ever move in with your best friend, make sure she doesnt fuck random dudes in your bed without changing the sheets\" on my story where even her mom saw it.\n\nI know it was a childish move but it honestly made me feel better.. a mutual friend had reached out calling me an AH for calling Linda out like that but I probably wouldnt have had she responded or apologized.\n\nAITA for humiliating her like that?\n\nEDIT: since a lot of you are asking.. the guy who told me gave me an accurate description of my room, told me himself that the elevated space for bed she had was uncomfortable for the deed and that she had suggested my room. And APOLOGIZED to me.. also the mutual friend asked her if it was true, not knowing how I found out about it, and Linda admitted she had done it but that it was a one off situation with a guy named XXX- which was a completely different guy than the one who told me - and them two dont know each other. so this happened at least twice and given the fact we had lived together for a while and she did that a month in, i am pretty confident it happened on multiple occasions.", "created_utc": 1669051130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z14exs/aita_for_humiliating_my_former_best_friend_for/", "score": 362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was unnecessary and done specifically to derive pleasure from making her feel bad and making it as public as possible. If you did have to tell others (to explain your relationship souring or to warn them from sharing an apartment with her) it would be best to do that individually rather than just broadcasting it to the public. Not only is that rude to her, it also is rude to everybody else (e.g. her mom) who you are now inserting into your drama. Also, has she replied to you since? Given that this is all based on the account of some stranger, it seems plausible that he was wrong or misrepresented the situation. What if she just hadn't responded to you yet because she was too busy and there was an actual explanation? You said you publicly shamed her in this way before even hearing a response from her...\n\nShe's the asshole for having sex in your bed (assuming this random guy was telling the truth), particularly, after holding you to such a high standard about going in her room with the book.\n\n> long one but I feel like context is key here..\n\nThe only context that was somewhat relevant was the book. The dog, previous apartment and cleaning habits don't really matter. It sounds like you're just trying to make her out to be as bad as possible rather than letting the judgement just rest on this particular situation.", "ESH.\n\nShe did a nice thing and because of that felt entitled to treating you poorly because you were in her debt. Nice people don\u2019t do nice things for the power. She isn\u2019t a nice person.\n\nWhen she realized she had no more power over you she moved out. While you\u2019re still dealing from the emotional fallout, which I don\u2019t want to minimize in the slightest, there is no reason for you to contact or reach out to her every again. You don\u2019t deserve dealing with her.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for feeling angry and vindictive. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for you to post things like this. It just puts you mentally back in that toxic space and reinserts her into your life. I do think it\u2019s better to move on and take care of yourself.\n\nSo while I get it, I think you were a bit of an A to yourself.

The fact that she saw it doesn't obligate her to respond right away. I know for me and a lot of people I know, I might have to wait a few weeks before I have the capacity to have a big serious conversation even if, in the meantime, I have time to have light conversations or generally use social media.\n\nAlso, if her timeline of responding was a determining factor in you posting publicly, why not warn her of that?\n\n> The guy gave me a pretty accurate description of my room and when the mutual friend asked her about it she was concerned how I found out and that it happened once with a guy xxx (which was a different guy than the one who told me)..\n\nSo, she lied to the mutual friend (describing another guy as the only incident) and you're using that lie in order to add credibility to what the guy said?

The reason we're talking about her response with respect to whether you are an asshole is merely that you don't actually have her side of the story.\n\n> I know what i did was a childish move but i dont feel like such an asshole given the context of the whole situation.\n\nLike I said, I think you were an asshole and I think you wanted to be an asshole. You're carving out some exception as though \"mean and childish\" isn't an asshole, when instead you can just say \"I was an asshole and I think she deserved me being an asshole\".\n\n> She is the kind of person who responds right away so her just opening the message and not responding to it was a clear sign for me.. if she was like you who needs several weeks to have a conversation, i would have respected that, i guess..\n\nHow she typically responds doesn't really matter since this is not the typical kind of message you'd send. I called out the difference between responding to more everyday messages compared to such a huge fight and accusation. It's reasonable that she might take longer to respond particularly to a message of this magnitude. And again, you ignored that I mentioned you also could have told her that if she didn't respond you'd do the facebook post. At least then you'd be letting her know the urgency of her response.\n\n> I mean the guy had no reason to come up with a lie like that and maybe the other guy she mentioned to the mutual friend was the only one she admitted to someone else?
