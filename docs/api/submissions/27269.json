I went to a charter school that had grades K-8. I ended up going to a public high school from grades 9-12.

My grades took a huge hit beginning of 9th grade because the public school\u2019s curriculum was designed around building off what you learned the previous year, and I wasn\u2019t taught that my previous year (ie, I did algebra 8th grade but public school did trigonometry, 9th grade at public school was doing pre-calculus which was based off of what you did in trigonometry) so I had to do a crap-ton of work to catch up to everyone else.", "NTA.

The first were \"segregation academies,\" where white parents sent their kids to keep them from having to sit next to black children in class. But courts ruled that if these academies wanted money from public taxes, they were not legally allowed to discriminate along racial or any other \"protected\" lines (gender, disability, etc.).\n\nCharters are a way around this restriction against discrimination. Most charters are nonprofit, but they can accept donations and charge tuition.  Many of the old segregation academies rebranded as charters. They can't legally exclude BIPOC students, but they can jack tuition up high enough to keep the numbers low. Some use entrance exams to exclude, penalizing those kids whose families can't afford test prep, disabled students who struggle with exams, and students with histories of trauma or oppression (i.e. immigrant kids, black & brown poor kids, homeless kids...), etc. Some admit everyone but then expel the kids who perform badly, as with OP's sister's kid. They're not *officially* discriminating against disabled, BIPOC, or poor kids, of course! They're just *de facto* discriminating against disabled, BIPOC, and poor kids. \n\nAlso, by siphoning public funding away from public schools, they create their own customers. That is, kids who struggle at underfunded public schools often come to charters instead, which increases underfunding (because tax money that would've supported that student at public school goes to the charter instead), which leaves less money for the public schools, which causes more kids to struggle.\n\nSo the good thing about charters is that they've allowed every special interest to create their own schools. There are lots of Afrocentric charters, for example; they also cannot discriminate, but they teach accurate American history, which public schools often struggle to do because of the politics.

Until systemic change is implemented it will NEVER stop.", "I'm not going to dox myself as to which district I'm in, but I've just never had a good experiences with charter schools treating learning disabilities. Public seems to offer more accommodations and aids.", "Oh.", "They\u2019re also a way to gut the membership of teachers unions, one of the last major strongholds of American organized labor. That\u2019s a big part of why they enjoyed bipartisan support for so long.", "You skipped the most important part, line their own pockets with public funds", "That's so freaking weird. Did they cut foreign language classes there too?\n\nI had heard that idea being thrown  around but I have no idea if it was ever implemented.", "that's by district. the public schools i went to had classes specifically for spanish speakers (ie, spanish for spanish speakers, us history for spanish speakers, etc) along with esl classes", "That's strange, most of the public schools near me offer dual-language emersion for Spanish because it's so common here.", "My friend taught ESL for a non profit in Asia, they also told him to only speak English.", "I'm surprised they didn't expell him sooner. (Which sucks), but you did warn her!!", "Not every public school. The public school I attended in NJ had bilingual classes with Spanish speaking teachers. As well as ESL classes. \n\nI\u2019m a teacher now in NYC and every school I\u2019ve taught encourage students to retain their home languages while learning English. Schools are also supposed to have any diagnostic testing in the student\u2019s native language and translation services for parents. There\u2019s even dual immersion schools where both languages are spoken daily throughout instruction. \n\nWhere and what kind of public schools have this thinking? It sounds reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s where teachers would forbade you from speaking another language.", "[removed]", "At least with public schools there are audit responsibilities and standards. That oversight sure should be better - but it\u2019s there, anyway.", "I do realize that. I'm sorry, I thought I was pretty clear that my stance is not \"charters are great and we need more of them,\" but maybe I didn't say that directly.\n\nYes, there are tons of problems with charter schools and I'm not arguing against any of them. I just wanted to say that the solution is not as simple as \"end charter schools and send more money to public schools.\"", "It\u2019s wild to me they say \u201cif you don\u2019t teach well, or more accurately if your students don\u2019t learn well, we\u2019ll make it even harder for you to teach/them to learn\u201d", "But if the students who are falling behind are holding them back isn\u2019t it detrimental to the students who aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t even get me started on the students who have zero regard for the teachers. I went to a public high school where teachers were spending more time policing students actions due to disrespect than teaching.", "Got it. We had \u201cacademies\u201d where it was only a test and your middle schools grades to get in.", "But I do pay for it.  Every April 14th, or earlier.", "So, don\u2019t get me wrong here, parents who have income and children who are excelling, should be punished by both local taxes and paying for private school?", "You also don\u2019t need to pass any state certifications in order to teach at a charter school, so there\u2019s that.", "Bingo", "I guess the idea is that sts pick up language better if it's presented as \"necessity\" to communicate, kinda like a visit in a country of which you don't know the language...", "You can learn a language through total immersion alone, but it's difficult. This is the goal of many language programs, however, as it's supposed to be able to create strong language skills. There's a big focus in language education on communicative approaches, ie, the more a student hears and produces a language, the faster and better they will be at using the language. The focus being on translation of terms vs just introducing them. This was actually how I was taught German in high school, at least the basics of the language, and I learned basic German much faster than I did basic Spanish, where a more traditional \"manzana means apple\" approach was used (I learned both at the same time).\n\nWhile this approach has been shown to be rather successful, most of the researchers and their literature even admit that, sometimes, it's best to teach them in the common language and not the native language so they understand the concept being taught to them.\n\nSource: graduated with a Spanish Ed bachelor's and a linguistics master's. Had to take a class in \"teaching foreign languages\" last semester, and we read so many studies about the communicative approach.", "I wanted to respond to your point about charter schools \"serving communities that have very poorly funded public schools?", "Immersion has been shown to be one of the quickest ways to learn a language...", "Yes they just offered Spanish and French. But it is district wise.", "I think it depends on resources and how many students they\u2019re serving.", "How is a student falling behind holding back the kid who\u2019s not? Charter schools don\u2019t magically fix behavior issues or bad grades, they just pretend those things don\u2019t exist by kicking out the students response and sending them back to the public schools who already don\u2019t receive enough funding to handle the issues appropriately and now receive even less funding because the shiny new charter school is siphoning away their money. All it does is punish the kids who can\u2019t go to a charter school, punish the teachers teaching at public school, and push this make believe narrative of superiority when really they\u2019ve just completely excised all the issues their top lazy to deal with", "We have schools like that in the US too, magnet Public schools are test in schools and are more rigorous while being free (I went to one)- charter schools don\u2019t test in but pretend to be exclusive to get performance grants they don\u2019t deserve", "\"punish\" is a weird way to talk about making sure no one is left out of quality education..", "Yes. Paying taxes isn't a punishment. I don't have kids and I pay local taxes and property tax. Am I being punished? No.   \nSome rich assholes want to send their kids to private schools, if they can afford it , cool I guess. Good for them. Doesn't mean they stop paying taxes, doesn't mean I need to subsidize private schools. If you can't afford to pay those taxes and send your kid to private school, guess your kid is going to public school. If it isn't good enough. Great, you get to join the fight to make them better or maybe move.", "Ideally the public schools just shouldn't suck. This largely isn't a problem in places outside the US that don't fund their schools at the local levels, but from the state level.\n\nThe problem is the American system is designed so that poorer black neighborhoods had dogshit schools and white suburban schools post-flight were excellent. Now that society is becoming more integrated, charter schools have quickly become the next form of white flight, draining money from local schools by bypassing the system in order to maintain their previous overfunded, mostly-segregated status.", "Yes.\n\nIt\u2019s not a punishment, however.\n\nWe *all* benefit from having guaranteed public education. We all are required to pay into that benefit. \n\nI have no kids, but I benefit from parents being able to work because school is there. I benefit because  the employees at the stores I go to have basic math and literacy skills. I also attended public school my whole life, and I benefitted from this system. \n\nThe parents cannot \u201copt-out\u201d of the benefits of the free universal education. Therefore, they cannot opt out of paying for it.\n\nThey\u2019ve also been provided with a perfectly good public utility. They can choose not to use it, but the government isn\u2019t going to pay them to piss away a benefit like that. If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s on offer, you pay for something else yourself.", "Paying taxes isn\u2019t a punishment, and you benefit from public schools even if your kids don\u2019t attend them. The majority of American kids are still educated in the public school system. Doctors, nurses, lawyers, librarians, engineers, many of these people have a public school education. I don\u2019t even have kids, but it\u2019s in my best interests for the public schools where I live to be well funded and appropriately managed, because the kids who attend those schools are the people I need to deal with in all areas of my life.", "This, too.\n\n Cultural incompetency as well. If I hear one more horror story about a student being harassed by the administration because of their hair, I am going to scream. This is why the Crown Act is so important.", ">Immersion has been shown to be one of the quickest ways to learn a language... ... once you have the basics.\n\nFTFY", "Kids acting out in class so harm others.", "Then schools need to start allowing teachers to punish as they are fit. In some counties, you can\u2019t punish students for disobedience or causing issues. Expulsion isn\u2019t a solution either.", "We had magnet school now thinking about how you phrased it.", "To clarify (I hope) a little. U.S. Charter schools take kids who test well and toss kids with issues so they end up testing better than public schools who not only can't do that but have to take the charter kids who got booted for testing poorly. Then the charters say, look how much better we did than this local public school who had to average in all the bad students we booted. They also pay shit, so the teachers they have generally are younger and less qualified. They are notoriously anti-union so the teachers they do have get no support and have to be worried about getting fired every time the wind changes.", "Lookin at you, Mystic Valley Charter!", "Jesus, what does that even mean? As much as I respect teachers no they shouldn\u2019t just be allowed to invent punishments on the fly for problematic students. A) they don\u2019t get paid enough for that, B) they\u2019re far too overworked as is, C) that\u2019s something administration should handle. Yes there\u2019s obviously an issue with schools being too lenient in some cases, but the solution isn\u2019t just \u201cteachers can punish kids however they want\u201d, just for starters there\u2019s god knows how many different reasons a kid might be acting out or misbehaving or has bad grades. The solution, as always, is better funding, more teachers, small class sizes, school counselors, etc. etc. But we already don\u2019t fund most public schools enough for that as is, and every charter school that siphons money away from them just exacerbates that issue on top of shunting all the \u201cbad\u201d kids back into the public school system because they genuinely don\u2019t give a shit about them.", "LOL, that was actually the school I was thinking about.", "I don\u2019t mean inventing punishments. Like allowing students who routinely misbehave to have to do community service or volunteer work or something to make them learn. More Administration is just gonna siphon money away from students."]}
