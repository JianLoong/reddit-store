I went to a charter school that had grades K-8. I ended up going to a public high school from grades 9-12.

My grades took a huge hit beginning of 9th grade because the public school\u2019s curriculum was designed around building off what you learned the previous year, and I wasn\u2019t taught that my previous year (ie, I did algebra 8th grade but public school did trigonometry, 9th grade at public school was doing pre-calculus which was based off of what you did in trigonometry) so I had to do a crap-ton of work to catch up to everyone else.", "NTA.

But courts ruled that if these academies wanted money from public taxes, they were not legally allowed to discriminate along racial or any other \"protected\" lines (gender, disability, etc.).\n\nCharters are a way around this restriction against discrimination. Most charters are nonprofit, but they can accept donations and charge tuition.  Many of the old segregation academies rebranded as charters. They can't legally exclude BIPOC students, but they can jack tuition up high enough to keep the numbers low. Some use entrance exams to exclude, penalizing those kids whose families can't afford test prep, disabled students who struggle with exams, and students with histories of trauma or oppression (i.e. immigrant kids, black & brown poor kids, homeless kids...), etc. Some admit everyone but then expel the kids who perform badly, as with OP's sister's kid.

They're just *de facto* discriminating against disabled, BIPOC, and poor kids. \n\nAlso, by siphoning public funding away from public schools, they create their own customers. That is, kids who struggle at underfunded public schools often come to charters instead, which increases underfunding (because tax money that would've supported that student at public school goes to the charter instead), which leaves less money for the public schools, which causes more kids to struggle.\n\nSo the good thing about charters is that they've allowed every special interest to create their own schools.

Parents of children with learning difficulties need to step up and help their children succeed.  Expecting the school to do everything is a sadly common trait of many parents.

You criticized your sister for choosing a different option than you and then used that as a reason to rub her nose in what you see as a poor choice.

I sat in on a class and nearly assaulted the teacher when I witnessed her on more than one occasion add onto the bullying of my daughter.  Instead, I filed a formal complaint, turned the situation into a police matter, and moved her to her current charter school.  She struggled with the academics for a while, but she was so much happier.  My son joined her when he was old enough.  He has a speech impediment and dyslexia.  He has had so much excellent help from his school.  He has gone from only family being able to understand what he says to a happy, talkative boy with many friends.  He gets all A's and loves school and reading.\n\nMy point is, charter schools are not always the answer, but they're not always the enemy either.  There is a reason that parents frequently choose them over traditional public schools.  The more common issue is parents treating schools as dumping grounds for their kids and expecting all learning to happen only on school grounds.

I even went to a \"Charter school\" until high school. \n\nHere's one thing that wasn't mentioned: They're less regulated than public schools. This also includes the curriculum. So, you know about all the \"Book bans\"? Well let's just say - Charter Schools can and have been doing it for decades. And you're not allowed to say anything about it since \"We're a *private* school, so 'free speech' doesn't apply!\". \n\nDon't want your kid learning that the Civil War was about slavery and states rights to own slaves? Well a charter school doesn't have to teach that. And I don't just mean they can teach it houwever they want - they can not teach it period. \n\nAdditionally? One other way that Charter Schools inflate their test scores? They give a way lower standard. I've had multiple students who were in a charter elementary school. And it depends - sometimes they were just kids who needed a little more attention or were ESL, and they're around the same level/not too far behind or sometimes even a bit ahead. Most of the time though? They're way behind. \n\nMuch of the time, they have undiagnosed disabilities - and like OP's nephew were kicked out because they were \"unworthy' and we have to fit in years of intervention. Other times, they got to just pass with less effort since their parents paid for \"A\"s. Either they got exempt from the state standardized testing (It depends on the state and even the county) or the teachers literally taught the test. We've had kids go from being a STraight \"A\" student in grade K-5 to suddenly struggling because they were actually performing at a third or even second grade level. I've literally had sixth graders give book reports on things like a Junie B Jones book or *Frog and Toad are Friends* because that's the sort of stuff they read in their charter school. \n\nDon't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with kids reading those. Not at all. But those are books that you typically teach to *first* and *second* graders - maybe even third graders. When you have middle schoolers thinking things like *A Wrinkle in Time* is too complex? That's a problem. \n\nWe've had multiple students from charter school who could at best be described as \"Feral\" - sometimes they were again, kids with undiagnosed disabilities that were just thrown to the side. Other times? The charter school itself was just some kind of a daycare, or their teacher was literally less qualified to teach than Peter Griffin. \n\nAnd my own experiences with \"Charter school\"? Well, I had to go to a \"Charter school\" until I was 14. I call it a \"Charter school\" with quotes because even the local charter schools who give us feral children do a much better job - it was basically a Residential School that focused primarily off of Catholic Dogma. The only erason I went there for so long was because it was the only place available - my parents had jobs, and if I went to the public schools I would have to be up at 5 AM and at school until as late as 7. And if the weather was bad? I would have to stay home. And when I made it to high school (Where I was old enough to stay there for late, be home alone, and to drive) I nearly flunked because I was so far behind. Meanwhile my neighbor who graduated from the catholic high school with a 4.0 GPA couldn't even do the sorts of things I had to do in Remedial Algebra - but she could tell you why God put her on this earth to just get banged and pop out babies and cook.

At that point it would make more sense to send the Spanish speaking ESL kids to Spanish class just to highlight the inequity that the English speaking students generally learn second languages in a bilingual classroom at least for the first couple years.  They'd probably have better outcomes picking up English there than a room where they can't even get started because they can't communicate with their teacher.", "When I was in high-school (long long ago), they had the ESL kids in the Spanish classes. I'm not sure how they handled tests and stuff, but the teacher always took time each class to work on English with them. Like a reverse of whatever lesson we were on. \n\nLooking back that sounds like an insane amount of work to put on those teachers.", "Yeah. I experienced that but I was in high school when that became a thing. We spoke in Spanish anyway", "This is wild to me. I'm on the West Coast, and not only are other languages ~allowed to exist~, our public schools have special classes and extra tutoring for ESL students. A big chunk of the library is made of Spanish-language books. There are bilingual story times. My district is even one of the more conservative ones in our area, and I can't even fathom the Spanish-speaking students not being allowed to speak Spanish.", "Ours do not. Several of the public schools even teach in both regardless of the child's first language, so all students learn English and Spanish.", "Not necessarily true, but it depends on where you live. It is true that they usually have rules about not speaking another language in normal classes, but many districts do have special ESL programs for kids who aren't native English speakers and not yet fluent enough to be in a normal class. I live in a rural area with very few non-native speakers, and our school district still has ESL teachers on staff just in case. Most times they only have one or two kids at a time, but so far they've continued funding the program.", "Not all public schools.  My SIL has worked in a truly bilingual early elementary program for years.  She teaches in both English and Spanish.\n\nThe ESL program in the same district is different and more complicated, as it must simultaneously serve students who speak a diversity of languages at home (our small Texas city acts as a receiving point for refugees from all over).  No idea what their policy is on speaking Spanish--maybe it would be perceived as unfair to half the class?", "That's wild. Growing up we had mandatory Spanish classes through elementary school. Grew up in southwest Colorado with a lot of immigrants that were learning English so the Spanish class doubled as an English class. This was all in public school. Definitely a fantastic thing to do and I now speak passable Spanish", "That's not universal.

Can\u2019t imagine why\u2026 Something about bankrupting the school system and the City? \n\nSo presumably the vouchers are cheaper than having to teach our kids - and Catholics and religious Jews who send to private school tend to have a lot of kids.", "The state of public education in the US was the first problem I ever encountered that has seemed harder to solve the more I learn about it.", "Give me back my anecdata.

So I\u2019m not really sure how to feel about me (as a smart behaved person) being used to \u201clift up\u201d a public school by continuing to go there, to my own detriment.

My uncle ran a whole ass public radio station through that school.  It was also a dangerous and terrible school. They had metal detectors outside the doors back in the early 90s lol. They also had no access to college credit classes of any kind. I\u2019m sure we could make great magnet schools if we fixed the system I\u2019m just saying nothing is fully working right now. Public schools are underfunded, charters are unregulated and can go very bad very quickly, private are crazy sometimes too, I legit did my undergrad thesis on how title 1 schools aren\u2019t really getting their extra funding they are entitled to because it\u2019s being misappropriated, etc etc. it\u2019s all fucked. I stumbled across an opportunity as a 14 year old and I took it. I\u2019m better for it. I don\u2019t feel guilty about that. There\u2019s also a charter school near me that is an amazing place for kids with autism. It is top top notch, no normal public school compares for their ESE curriculum. They do amazing life skills work and allow the kids to attend until 21 and help with job placement and other adult transition tasks. And it\u2019s FREE. That\u2019s a good thing! If every public school could have that if we abolished charter schools that would be amazing but that\u2019s not going to happen!

We have a public school in a ritzy neighborhood that has off the charts test scores, yada yada. Why? Because they force all kids with learning disabilities to go to another district and refuse to let them in. They then get outrageous money for their test score results when in actuality they just skewed the numbers to get more money. They should be getting less money because none, and I mean zero, of the kids in the school system have any type of learning disorder or other disability. You are rewarding the school for basically cheating.", "This has already been addressed by a few others much better than I could, but one point I didn't yet see made - the loss of the middle class by deepening income inequalities is bad for everyone. A family might get the short term \"gain\" of their kid having slightly more opportunities, but if the majority of the rest of the community finds their economic/opportunity options getting worse, that cascades out.\n\nOne of the reasons I'm against trickle down - The wealthy do not have a monopoly on ideas. New innovation should come from every level, not piecemeal as the ultra rich feel like it. If a poor family isn't getting a quality education, despite having brilliant kids, it limits growth everywhere. Families having to work two jobs to make ends meet can't focus on their passion projects. Families having to spend an extra hour to transport their kids to the further away charter school are going to be too tired to work on the next Dyson vacuum or Google or PC. I want my tax money to be providing quality opportunities to everyone, not just a select few that can afford it, because I also benefit more from that, both directly and indirectly.", "We're gonna have to agree to disagree here. Your idea there isn't necessarily wrong, but I think it just isn't the same as institutional racism and segregation. That kid could thrive just fine in a public school.

Black people were being discriminated against in the schools they were legally required to attend, and then faced more discrimination when they were required to go somewhere else. \n\nThe mother had a choice.

The city was an academic center with numerous colleges and universities.  \n\nOne year, on the first day of school, I found that I had a student from Taiwan in my class. She spoke no Englishp, but her parents, who were visiting faculty at one of the universities, wanted her in regular classes without ESL instruction.\n\nShe worked incredibly hard from day 1 in my class and her English came along very quickly.  My class was college entrance with a universal statewide final, so she had to learn not only the language but also the scientific material.\n\nI cannot tell you how proud I was of her when she scored a B+ on the final!\n\nShe was far above the norm and not many students would have been able to match her accomplishment.", "For subjects like math and science, on the other hand, research says that adding the native language to the language of the school dramatically increases success.

Would you be in favor of special needs only schools, cuz where I went for highschool they literally used the special needs students to clean the cafeteria or run the register.", "All the charter schools I know of cater to Black and Latino children. The parents are desperate to get their kids in, because the public schools are terrible. And not because of funding either, although that doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s because they are fostering an environment hostile to learning by either refusing, or having their hands tied, or both, when it comes to enforcing behavior rules on disruptive students that are preventing anyone else from learning. I\u2019m sorry, but if your kid has major behavioral issues, they do NOT belong in a mainstream environment!\n\nThe wealthier areas don\u2019t have this issue, because the parents have the funds or knowledge to force the City to pay for their kids with major behavioral issues to go to schools well suited for them. So kids in those schools can learn. \n\nIncidentally, the City refuse to create its own supportive schools is the most expensive part of the education budget. My severely disabled daughter is in a private school for medically vulnerable kids with severe cognitive and physical disabilities. 100 grand a year that the City has to pay because they a) can\u2019t provide a small enough class size, b) can\u2019t provide appropriate 1-on-1 instruction for her, c) can\u2019t provide multiple therapies she has been approved for, and d) cannot provide assistive devices she has been approved for. There are 6 kids in her class and age group. The school employs a lawyer to deal with this for parents, and every year the City pays them millions to do what they can\u2019t.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just one school, for the most severe children. Most Public Schools can\u2019t meet the classroom sizes requested on most IEPs for behavioral issues. Any parent with the knowledge and money then forced the City to pay through the nose for Private schools that CAN meet the IEP. As they should, because the City SHOULD be doing it and only needs to pay because it won\u2019t. \n\nBut poor families lack the funds, and often lack the knowledge, to get their kids with learning and behavioral issues into schools equipped to service them. Instead they put kids who shouldn\u2019t be in a typical classroom setting in mainstream schools that aren\u2019t remotely equipped to handle them, to the detriment of everyone.\n\nCharter schools, as many have noted, simply try to force those kids out or straight up refuse to accept them. Which is bad for those kids, but good for all the kids who can thrive in a typical classroom setting. And you can say the Charters made it worse, but this was an ongoing problem even before Charters. NYC just really needs Public Schools that are geared to the needs of children who are not going to function well in a typical classroom setting.", "FYI, the article I linked earlier, was an instance, where a black person had a choice, and chose to go somewhere that they knew they would face more discrimination than the \u201ceasier\u201c option of a historic black school.
