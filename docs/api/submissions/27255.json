There was no cheating involved. They were also never married. But my dad was always shitty to my mom. He would call her things like \"dumb c\\*\\*\\*\" and would tell her she was worthless. One time, right before my mom finally left him, he told her it was all her fault they were stuck together and she should have known her IUD was failing. He also taunted her that her body couldn't even respond correctly to an IUD pregnancy and that most women's bodies know to get rid of them.\n\nHe never said things like that directly in front of me. But he also didn't know that kids will often hear shit they don't want to hear. I didn't fully get what it all meant back then. I just hated hearing my mom cry so much.\n\nThey ended up with shared custody of me after the breakup and my dad got married and started a family with his wife. My half siblings are 7, 5, 4, 2 and 4 months old. My 7 and 5 year old half siblings have asked why I go to mom's without them and if they can go. My dad heard that one time and decided that my mom should be inviting my half siblings over and offering to babysit. This was maybe 6ish months ago and ever since he has been on her case and pressing her to meet my half siblings and invite them over when I'm home with her.\n\nI told my half siblings they don't get to come because they live with their mom and dad already. But I live with my mom too. Just at a different time. They were all excited and said we could all have two homes and they could come. I said no, that it didn't work that way.\n\nMy dad and his wife didn't explain shit to them and dad just kept pressing the issue with mom. I heard him on the phone with her and he even tried telling me that I needed to pick the 7 and 5 year old's up from school and bring them to mom's when I was going.\n\nMom tries to keep me out of it but I see the strain it puts on her. I know she has intentionally kept away from my dad and has never met the kids he has for a reason. I decided to approach my mom about it all and she was so upset that I knew. I promised her that I did not blame her and I asked if she would go back to court and get a judge to grant me permission to decide if I go to dad's. She said she would talk to her lawyer first and then go. Her lawyer said the wording was vague but I could possibly just stop going and she wouldn't get into trouble with the lawyer since technically the wording isn't very strong on how long the order lasts. Mom and I agreed though that dad would probably fight it, for appearances sake more than out of love for me. The only reason I don't just stop going now is if we can avoid court I want to, for mom's sake.\n\nWhen dad started his hit with mom two days ago I told him he needs to leave mom alone or I won't come to his house anymore. I said she doesn't need to take care of his other kids and he doesn't need to harass her over it. He said I had no right to interfere in an adult issue and told me I should speak to him with more respect.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695199050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ng10d/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_needs_to_leave_my_mom/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want to have some fun and don\u2019t care about consequences like being grounded by your dad, feel free to do one of the following (especially if you can get some of your younger siblings in on it):\n\n1.) Since you dad is demanding \u201crespect\u201d from you, every time your dad walks in the room, announce him like they do in the medieval movies (\u201cAll hail King (insert name of choice here), first of his name, unquestioned ruler of his domain!\u201d). \n\n2.) An extension of #1, bow every time you see him and respond to everything he tells with a \u201cyes my liege\u201d. The more over the top, the better. \n\n3.) This one is probably over the top but why the hell not: I read a snippet where someone got fed up and finally managed to stop their parents from misgendering their sibling after two years using an air horn every time the parents did it (think it was thanksgiving dinner). Took 2 hours and the issue was fixed permanently. Maybe the next time he\u2019s on the phone and giving your mother shit, you can set it off every time he\u2019s less than pleasant with her. \n\nPlay your cards right, and you may annoy him into either being nicer to your mother or not wanting you there \u201ccorrupting\u201d his other kids.", "NTA.

And this stranger is very proud of you for sticking up for and defending your mother. Your father is being abusive to your mother and trying to control and intimidate her into free childcare. This seems to be the norm for him, and this has left scars for your mom that makes it difficult for her to firmly stand up for herself, or insist on no contact between them. Your mom should consider ending direct contact with your father, as his continued beratement is not good for her (or you). You both deserve better from the \"adult\".", "NTA.

To me, this is a \u201ctell\u201d that your mother is practicing parental alienation. \n\nOf course, I can\u2019t tell what is actually going on in your life based on a few paragraphs.  Neither of your parents should be disparaging the other.  They should be leaving you out of their squabbles.  This is obviously not happening.\n\nYou are now of an age where you can (more or less) do what you want (stay with mom or with dad).   I would urge you to make any decision based on how each parent treats you, not how one treats the other.  I would be particularly concerned when one parent is encouraging you to break off your relationship with the other.  A good parent wants you to have a good life in both homes.\n\nI would urge you to a see a therapist (one with a focus on family issues) so that you can talk these things through with an independent third party.
