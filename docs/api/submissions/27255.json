There was no cheating involved. They were also never married. But my dad was always shitty to my mom. He would call her things like \"dumb c\\*\\*\\*\" and would tell her she was worthless. One time, right before my mom finally left him, he told her it was all her fault they were stuck together and she should have known her IUD was failing. He also taunted her that her body couldn't even respond correctly to an IUD pregnancy and that most women's bodies know to get rid of them.\n\nHe never said things like that directly in front of me. But he also didn't know that kids will often hear shit they don't want to hear. I didn't fully get what it all meant back then. I just hated hearing my mom cry so much.\n\nThey ended up with shared custody of me after the breakup and my dad got married and started a family with his wife. My half siblings are 7, 5, 4, 2 and 4 months old. My 7 and 5 year old half siblings have asked why I go to mom's without them and if they can go. My dad heard that one time and decided that my mom should be inviting my half siblings over and offering to babysit. This was maybe 6ish months ago and ever since he has been on her case and pressing her to meet my half siblings and invite them over when I'm home with her.\n\nI told my half siblings they don't get to come because they live with their mom and dad already. But I live with my mom too. Just at a different time. They were all excited and said we could all have two homes and they could come. I said no, that it didn't work that way.\n\nMy dad and his wife didn't explain shit to them and dad just kept pressing the issue with mom. I heard him on the phone with her and he even tried telling me that I needed to pick the 7 and 5 year old's up from school and bring them to mom's when I was going.\n\nMom tries to keep me out of it but I see the strain it puts on her. I know she has intentionally kept away from my dad and has never met the kids he has for a reason. I decided to approach my mom about it all and she was so upset that I knew. I promised her that I did not blame her and I asked if she would go back to court and get a judge to grant me permission to decide if I go to dad's. She said she would talk to her lawyer first and then go. Her lawyer said the wording was vague but I could possibly just stop going and she wouldn't get into trouble with the lawyer since technically the wording isn't very strong on how long the order lasts. Mom and I agreed though that dad would probably fight it, for appearances sake more than out of love for me. The only reason I don't just stop going now is if we can avoid court I want to, for mom's sake.\n\nWhen dad started his hit with mom two days ago I told him he needs to leave mom alone or I won't come to his house anymore. I said she doesn't need to take care of his other kids and he doesn't need to harass her over it.

Start compiling any messages your mom has already received, and start keeping a log of calls and messages until her lawyer thinks you have enough to argue that she is being harassed. Even if your mom wants to avoid courts, this kind of ruling shouldn't take longer than a day. May be worth ripping off the band-aid as opposed to a custody battle which might take longer. \n\n- As for your half-siblings: their father has convinced them that going to your mom's house would be like a fun sleepover. Convince them it's not. Tell them your mom's house is really boring. Tell them she has no toys for them to play with. Tell them she makes you do chores all day. Make it so they do not want to go to your mom's house and will fight your dad about it every time he brings it up. \n\n- Continue to refuse to pick up your half-siblings from school on days where you go to your mom's house.

From my point of view there isn\u2019t a way in which you won\u2019t have any stress coming from your asshole of a sperm donor.

He was probably abusive before that too.\n\nYour father doesn't deserve the family that he has. I can only hope that he never turns that disgusting attitude onto his wife and your half siblings.\n\nI hate to say it but this is something that you will probably have to take it to court over, and testify in court against him if you choose to live at your mothers.\n\nMaybe with the harassment your mother could get a restraining order against him.\n\n\nI'd suggest recording him wherever he does things like that or recording your conversations with him but that could cause issues in court.", "NTA but wow your dad is.

Well, that\u2019s a different question.\n\nAre you the AH for telling your dad this? No. He is.\n\nIs it possible you made things worse for your mom in the short-term? Yes. It sounds like your dad is used to trying to call the shots and he doesn\u2019t handle it well when someone stands up to him. As a result, he might try to harass you more or turn your siblings against you/your mom.\n\nBut, even if you made things worse for her in the short-term by trying to limit his bullying power, you\u2019re not the AH. You saw your dad was acting inappropriately, you saw it was/would hurt your mom, and you limited his ability to continue.

Make sure your email account has a password that your dad can never figure out.

I know you are protecting mom but any court appearances would be in your favor anyway. Judges talk to the kids, they know the adults fight and think they are right so they always try and get what they can from the kids. You just have to keep a record of this and you can tell them exactly why you want your father out of your life. \n\nSo my advice, stop going to his house.

You are old enough to choose where you spend your time. Your father is being ridiculous and insane. Why on the world would your mother want anything to do with HIS kids? Babysit them?

You are speaking up because you are almost grown and his behavior is affecting your time with your mom and half-siblings.  If he wants a babysitter, then he can go hire one.

Otherwise, your mom doesn't have to talk to the man and all communications can go through you.  I suggest for a paper trail that she forces communications through email or text, email preferred.
