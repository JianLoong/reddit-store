She arrived on Halloween, stating that she was planning on staying with her ex husband/ my (F27)  husband\u2019s (M27) father (not a good idea at all given the type of person he is) with no money, no job, and no plan. Two weeks into the stay, he predictably kicked her out and she then revealed to me (during a hellish dinner party at our house a week later) that her plan \u201call along\u201d was actually to crash at my house. I was absolutely against this as she has an OxyContin addiction and our 3 year old child lives in our home. During this dinner, she told me that she saw a future with her abusive ex and wanted to return to him, which was confusing. I put my foot down and said she would not be staying with us. My husband put up a fight, but he ultimately gave in to me. MIL had an apartment voucher and was accepted Into a homeless shelter as I made it clear she could not stay with us. I know these things because at this time, she had her mail coming to our house, which would have made her legally our tenant had she stayed with us, according to the laws of our state. (Im sure she knew this) We even fixed up a car and gave it to her free of charge, so she could get to and from the job she claimed to have found. Then, one week ago, she took the car we fixed for her and drove back to the state she had originally been living in. She returned to her \u201cabusive\u201d partner, who apparently wasn\u2019t any worse to her than getting a job and finding an apartment would be.  After all this, my husband still blames me for her big \u201cescape\u201d not working out.

NTA", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is clearly a manipulative person, and when you add in the fact she has a drug addiction allowing her to move in is a recipe for a disaster.", "NTA. You had a gut feeling, the signs were there and you needed to protect your child. If she succeeded, then it would be you and the child moving out of the house because there was no way she was planning to leave.\n\nSit down your husband and have a chat, explain it how you explained things here. He's thinking about this emotionally because it's his Mother, not rationally. If she's an addict, then she is a liar. You don't seem to mention anything before this grand escape, so it didn't seem like she reached out to her baby boy to protect her. The whole thing seems like just a way for her to squat at your place for free, which you prevented.", "Nta. Your first priority is the health safety and security of your child and yourself. Inviting an unstable person with no resources and who is still actively making poor life choices is just plain stupid.  Your husband is a fool. So many things would have gone wrong. And I say would. Not could. At a very minimum she planned on weasling her way into your home and mooch off of you like you were the local flophouse.her sense of entitlement and admission that from the beginning she lied and realy planned on staying with you .  Worst case scenarios...she gets high/brings substances into your home and your child succumbs to an accidental overdose   the \"abusive\" ex comes to your home and endangers/harms you or the child. \nYou didn't make her homeless. She had options. She was trying to play you by crying abuse so that she could use you. Probably clean you out of every dime and valuable she could tonsupport her addiction. When you didn't roll out the red carpet and fall for her ploy she went back home.", "NTA. Your child's safety is priority 1. You did the right thing. She needs to get her own ducks in a row before she springs plans on people, anyway. I think a job is exactly what she needs.", "NTA, you just have good boundaries.\n\nShe is not homeless due to you. She is homeless due to substance abuse. You didn't do that to her and you have no obligation to allow that chaos into your home.", "NTA -- this person exploited every opportunity you gave her for her own benefit, and you are not responsible for any choices that she makes. I hope your husband comes to understand that.", "NTA. E S H except you tbh. What a nightmare.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is an adult and can make her own decisions. And she is not so elderly and infirmed that she needs a caretaker.\n\nAnd you were very much in the right to keep her out of your house. You do not need someone addicted to Oxy around your three-year-old. While your husband is very kind to be concerned about your mother's welfare, in this case, he should defer to your judgment.\n\nWe must live in the same state. Florida has the same law regarding mail. Once you receive mail at an address, you're a legal resident. And we also have the same problem with pharmaceutical addicts.", "NTA. You are responsible for your daughter's emotional and physical well-being. Moving a drug addict in would have made you the AH. Kinda makes your husband an AH for vying for it....", "NTA, you did the right thing since you have a child to think about - what of your child got their hands on one of her pills?", "NTA. You did not make her homeless. You helped her find a place to stay while she got back on her feet & even gave her a car. I'm not sure why you put words like abuse in scare quotes, though. She's an addict & she's making terrible decisions, which seems to include being with terrible men. If she decides to leave again, you & your husband should do what you can to help, but bringing an addict into your house with your kid isn't on the table.", "NTA\n\nNot liking the options you have is not the same thing as not having options. \n\nYou made sure that your Mil had the ability to work to support herself as well as a safe place to live. You weren\u2019t obligated to provide her with the place she decided to live, and thereby endanger your child. She chose to return to her old life.", "YTA because of your use of scare quotes around \"escape\" and \"abuse.\"\n\nI don't blame you at all for not keeping her stay with you, but you are being dismissive of a serious situation and you have no idea if it's true or not. \n\nPeople go back to their abusers all the time, so please don't use that as justification for calling her a liar.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't care if she's his mother or the 2nd coming of the Virgin!!  You have done more than anyone has a right to expect in helping her with a vehicle.  If she really was in an abusive situation, which I gather you doubt and I don't blame you, she had alternatives, but I guess taking care of herself didn't sound like fun.  No way in all the circles of hell should she be allowed to bring her issues into your home.
