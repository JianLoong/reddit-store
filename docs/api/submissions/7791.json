Ever since my body just completely skips over the symptoms I was used to and goes right onto \"is this my last breath?\"\n \nETA: a pet is not a gift, that's a financial responsibility. What if your finances were hitting a low and you decided not to get cats to save $$? \n\n\nAbsolutely NTA!!", "NTA for insisting the cats be removed from your home.

She might have thought she was getting them a good home, but she may have done just the opposite.\n\nHowever, you don't seem to understand cats. It did not matter whether you husband wanted the cats on the bed. Cats sleep wherever they damn well please. They would have insisted on being with their humans even if the door was shut. They would have made a racket. They would have tried to open the door themselves.

Especially since my husband travels and I\u2019m the one home and I\u2019m the one who does 99.9% of the animal care (except when I visit my family once a year.) Having pets gets me up when my health flares up, they calm me when I\u2019m stressed, they lay with me when I feel like I\u2019m dying, and I generally enjoy *their* company.  It\u2019s a different type of love and companionship.
