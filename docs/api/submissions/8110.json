Stacy had left some math worksheets and had written on the substitute plan for me to pass them out. The worksheets had about thirty multiplication problem involving multiplying two-digit numbers by two-digits. It looked like it would take about a half hour to do (at least for me, and I\u2019m a teacher).\n\nThen after about ten minutes, the first girl stands up and walks over to turn in her work and lays it on the desk. I see that she has not completed the last two problems. I asked this girl, Quinn, why she hadn\u2019t completed said problems. She said she was confused and figured she could learn about it when her teacher got back.\n\n\u201cQuinn, you probably don\u2019t understand this, but people like you won\u2019t succeed in life if you don\u2019t finish your work,\u201d I told her. Instead of taking the worksheet back when I picked it up and held it in front of her, she walked away, and sat down at her desk and looked all sad.\n\nI feel like I was just trying to teach her a lesson, but now I am a bit scared that I was a little harsh, so Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1674526124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10juese/aita_the_asshole_for_telling_my_student_she_wont/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Throwaway account!\n\nI am a  substitute teacher. Today one of my teacher friends, Stacy, had to step out and asked me to be her sub for her fourth grade class. I agreed. This would be first time subbing for Stacy\u2019s class!\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer in the idea that you need to work for what you want, and have to put in the effort. Stacy had left some math worksheets and had written on the substitute plan for me to pass them out. The worksheets had about thirty multiplication problem involving multiplying two-digit numbers by two-digits. It looked like it would take about a half hour to do (at least for me, and I\u2019m a teacher).\n\nThen after about ten minutes, the first girl stands up and walks over to turn in her work and lays it on the desk. I see that she has not completed the last two problems. I asked this girl, Quinn, why she hadn\u2019t completed said problems. She said she was confused and figured she could learn about it when her teacher got back.\n\n\u201cQuinn, you probably don\u2019t understand this, but people like you won\u2019t succeed in life if you don\u2019t finish your work,\u201d I told her. Instead of taking the worksheet back when I picked it up and held it in front of her, she walked away, and sat down at her desk and looked all sad.\n\nI feel like I was just trying to teach her a lesson, but now I am a bit scared that I was a little harsh, so Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. You couldn\u2019t bother to explain what she couldn\u2019t understood?\n\nHow are you a teacher????", "Yeah, that was a bit shitty of you to say to her. What was she supposed to do, fill in the wrong answer? She clearly wanted help. She\u2019s not going to fail at life just because she struggled with some math problems.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about it coming back to you but maybe try to be a little less condescending in the future.

You probably don\u2019t understand this, but people like you won\u2019t succeed in life if you don\u2019t finish your work. You know, the work you are paid to do\u2026teach children.

Hard to believe you a school hasn't hired you full time!  /s", "YTA. \"Teachers\" like you are why so many kids end up hating school and learning. She will forever remember you as the worst teacher ever. You remind me of my 4th grade teacher, Mrs Munoz. Yeah, I still hate her too.", "YTA. Who let you be around children?", "YTA. And as a teacher myself, this post is highly suspicious. Your \u201cteacher friend stepped out\u201d and you covered her class? That\u2019s not how it usually works.

If the student turned an incomplete paper in after ten minutes, why didn\u2019t you offer to help her with those incomplete problems? That\u2019s your job. What you said was hurtful and completely out of line. You were too harsh, and yes, you ought to be scared.", "YTA. You have no business being a teacher with that attitude.

Just like adults, children tend to remember the most beautiful and hateful things that are said to them as a child. You\u2019re terrible. She probably thinks she will be a failure and I\u2019m not overreacting either. Children think differently. When they are told that they are failures, they feel this in their heart and don\u2019t know how to respond. This is TRAUMATIC for a child. Want to know what\u2019s even worse?
