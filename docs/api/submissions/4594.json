When they had reached out to me to help pay for my sisters dress I was very hesitant\u2026Let me explain why. When I was younger and still living with my parents I was working hard at a minimum wage job. I made only about 14 an hour but I saved everything I could. I had one place where I kept most my cash that I withdrew from my paycheck for emergencies. I had about 200 in my special spot then suddenly it was all gone.\n\nI told myself that there was no way somebody would have taken it but I still asked my sister and parents,they all said no.

Even after I told my parents they shrugged it off and said ,\u201dshe\u2019s a kid,she probably needs it more than you do.\u201d After that I stopped withdrawing money and just kept it all online. My parents fully knew my sister was taking my hard earned money from me but didn\u2019t say anything. So when they asked about the dress I was a bit hesitant,and said it\u2019d only be about 400 in total so I\u2019d pay 200. I said ok about paying for it and waited for the link on the dress.\n\nA week passed and they sent me the link. It's a completely different dress that would be about 1000$.I urgently texted them about how they sent me the wrong dress,they said my sister had changed her mind last minute and wanted that one instead. I explained to them that paying 200 was already a bit pushy for me,but 500 was beyond me. After many days of angry calls and messages they wouldn't back down. So I told them that I won\u2019t be contributing to her dress period. Because she used to take money from me and that Im already struggling enough.\n\nWhen I had just gotten home from my second job I saw my parents ,my sister,with my boyfriend. As soon as they saw me they went ape sh*t.Mother was getting all in my face and saying how I was a greedy slimy wh*re and that I was selfish. Dad was comforting my \u201ccrying sister\u201d,it was a mess.They threw more fits and stormed out of my place.Found out from a relative that I was no longer invited to the quince,I feel bad for turing them down but others say im not in the wrong.

If your sister wants that dress so badly she should get a job and save up for it. It sounds like she desperately needs to learn the value of a dollar.

I would\u2019ve never even agreed to that in the first place let alone pushing it like that.", "NTA, and you are being extorted by a thief. Not one dime.", "Ok, I read this heteronormativity and assumed you were female, their behavior makes far more sense knowing you are an out gay male (it's abhorrent, still, but I can see why they act this way). Totally NTA and they are trying to punish you for being gay. Time for LC or NC here until they can accept you for who you are and don't favor your sister because she's a girl and the boys should work and pay for everything.", "NTA\n\nYou know when you add up all the money sis took, it was probably about $1000. I think you've more than paid enough.", "Info: why do they think you need to be responsible for paying for half of her dress?\n\nEdit: NTA -which I assumed all along. \nYou have no financial obligation to pay for your sister\u2019s dress. That is your parents responsibility to her. You were gracious enough to offer anything & they took that for granted. I would have rescinded the offer as well once she got greedy.", "NTA and its your parents job to pay for your sister\u2019s dress not yours. Your better off not going, they treat you badly and have no respect for you", "NTA is throwing a childish tantrum. The golden girl of hers doesn't get what she wants and they attack you. A quincea\u00f1era is expensive (Mexican here) and they should have prevented the expenses themselves. I'm really sorry for you. Remember: your family is horrible and you are not to blame. I would recommend cutting ties for a while. This with the purpose of taking care of your mental health.\n\nIf they keep breaking into your house, notify the landlord and change the locks. You don't have to put up with annoying people in your own home. Your house, your rules.", "Your sister is the golden child.  Sorry.  just say no.  You should never pay people to be your friend", "NTA, but OP, your family sounds very toxic. It appears that they have favorite child and you are a second class citizen; worse still, an ATM.\n\nI am concerned that your bf went along with this nonsense.

Why are you buying her dress instead of her anyway?", "Listen my man. You're parents did a number on you - making you feel guilty for not contributing to your sister's dress AFTER years of her stealing from you.

OP I agree with the others, please go NC/LC for your own mental health and sanity. NTA AT ALL.", "Sounds like your sister is the golden child that can do no wrong. You should cut them out of your life,  the audacity to come to your house and verbally abuse you is crazy. Next time call the cops! Nta.", "NTA. I\u2019m not super familiar with quince so forgive my ignorance but is the entire family contributing to the dress typical? If so, it still sounds unreasonable given the money she\u2019s taken in the past and your current financial situation and if not, it seems ridiculous that they\u2019d expect you to contribute.", "Stopped reading.  YWNBTA, tell your sister you already contributed several hundred dollars to her disposable income without being asked first. Tell her to consider yourselves even. Yeah that's right, you haven't forgotten her lying about stealing your money. So no she's not welcome until she's apologized for that one.", "Definitely NTA. You did great, just don't cave in to them. When your sister stole from you and your parents condoned it, they canceled out any obligations you might feel you owe. You keep strong.", "NTA.   You are not obliged to pay even $1 toward anything for anyone in that family.  Apparently your sister is the golden child.  She stole from you repeatedly and your parents didn\u2019t care.  Do not cave and send them a thank you for not inviting you to her quince.  Seriously you need to go no contact. You are starting your own life with your own debts, don\u2019t take your money and waste it on your family.  They stole how much money from you - I know it was your sister but your parents were culpable.", "NTA. Money that she might have stolen aside - why should you contribute to a $1000 dress for a whiney brat?  $200 was already taking advantage of your good will. No 15 year old needs a quince dress like that unless the family are already millionaires and can afford it themselves.  You are managing your life well it sounds like, so ignore them and continue on.  Good luck!", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s quinc\u00e9 is not your financial responsibility. You offered what you could they turned it down. You get what you get and don\u2019t have a fit!", "Your parents and sister are poisonous. Give them nothing. Consider seriously just cutting them out of your lives. Your parents have already brought your sister up to be an entitled thief. NTA", "NTA. They we\u2019re taking advantage of you. They\u2019re verbally and emotionally abusing you and have a history of doing so. Your sister is a thief and your parents enabled her criminal behavior. Honestly, it was very generous of you to agree to contribute to her dress at all. You\u2019re her sister, not her parents. That expense should solely be theirs. If she\u2019s so adamant about the dress she wants then she should get a job to pay for her dress. \n\nInstead whats occurred is that your sister\u2019s got a history of stealing from you and has learned that your money is hers to take without repercussions. So is now expecting more from you than you can afford (or even need) to give. They are all behaving like greedy, spoiled, brats that will throw fits and retaliate with hurtful revenge and mean insults when they\u2019ve been told no. \n\nYou are doing the right thing. Stand your ground. Hold on to your boundaries. And if they want to cut you out of their lives over something as materialistic as money and quince dresses then that\u2019s their problem. You\u2019re better off without the abuse.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need these abusive people in your life. Go NC and don\u2019t let them treat you this way anymore.", "NTA- I\u2019m so blown by how many families do this to their adult children. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are rich AF, you are an adult who earns your own money and are perfectly capable of deciding how you want to spend it. Enough with the guilt trips, you owe them nothing. They are her parents, let them take care of it. The dress only got more expensive because you were contributing.", "NTA. She stole and they enabled. I hope they have a nice time.", "NTA\n\nFirst, stealing is never okay. Just because some one is a child doesn't give them a free pass to steal.\n\nSecond, you are not obligated to pay anything towards your sister's dress. You're not the parent. Clothing her is not your responsibility, *especially for a non-essential item!!!!*\n\nThird, it's crappy of your parents to suddenly change the price on you.\n\nFourth, your sister does not need a $1000 dress. Idc what the event is, she doesn't need it. There are plenty of beautiful dresses for less than $200 at consignment shops that are in excellent condition. I got my prom dress for like $30 dollars from one, and everyone complimented it.\n\nFifth, their response was completely disproportionate to the situation. Frankly, I would inform them that you will not longer contribute anything towards your sister, as they don't need a \"w\\*\\*re's\" money. I also would not give your sister any kind of gift if this is how she is going to act.\n\nHonestly, this either sounds like a golden child scenario or that your parents just don't want to actually parent.\n\nEdit: Read your comments and saw the full situation. I'm glad you're considering going NC or LC, and I'm sorry your parents are letting their homophobia rob them of what sounds like a good, hardworking son. Stay strong, OP!!", "Gads!  You will never make them see the injustice of their attitude toward you.  Don\u2019t try.  Time to ho no contact. No mother who loved her child could treat you way she did or scream such abuse at you.\n\nClose that family door and live your best life without them.  They don\u2019t deserve you and you certainly don\u2019t  deserve them.", "NTA \n\nAlso MOST of your family is on your side! That means you are most definitely NTA\n\nAnd no kid owes their sister a dress. Especially the golden child sister who stole from you!\n\nKeep succeeding where you are and ignore that noise", "Nta ofc.\n\nYour sister is not your daughter, if she wants a quince she either needs to get a job and pay for it or your parents need to pay for it.\n\nAlso, a quince is not a necessity, it's a privilege. No one owes your sister a quince or a dress for a quince or anything at all. Your parents sound bananas to me, and abusive at the very least.\n\nI know that in the Hispanic community you are supposed to do things for family bc \"they are family\" but there has to be boundaries of some sort. You are barely able to keep yourself afloat. Those 200 or  500 could be used for you to have an emergency fund. Paying for your sister's dress shouldn't be a priority at all.\n\nTo whoever insults you or calls you to berate you, tell them they are welcome to pitch in their hard earned money instead bashing you for smth that's not your problem.\n\nBeing uninvited from your sister's quince will be the smallest of your problems. Surrounded yourself w people that are nice to you.", "NTA the next time they\u2019ll contact you is when they want money from you. You don\u2019t need these toxic people in your life.", "NTA. Why should you be paying for the quince of a person who has already stolen hundreds of dollars from you?", "NTA. Your sis can do what you did and get a job. At least she won't have someone stealing the money from under her.", "NTA, why would you help pay for your thieving sisters dress?
