Not at all.

Their problem, not yours.", "NTA I guess the friendly favors part of your relationship is now over. I wouldn\u2019t feel obligated to help her out after this.", "NTA. She sat around for two hours getting all worked up when all she had to do was stroll over and retrieve the parcel herself.", "Geez, were you supposed to be waiting by the door for her when she got home?  NTA.", "NTA if she knew it was there for hours there was 0 reason for her not to try and get it. I'd let them leave it at her doorstep from now on for porch pirates if she's gonna be that way.", "NTA and I hope that's the last time you take in a parcel for her. They should always be the ones to collect it, you're doing them the favour, how rude", "NTA. You got sidetracked, it wasn't on purpose. If she wanted it that badly she could've stopped by earlier.", "NTA. If the package was that important, they should have been there to receive it directly. If you hadn't accepted it for them, I assume the delivery company wouldn't have tried again until the next day at the earliest. You don't even need to bring up excuses, it's not your job.", "NTA. It's her package, and it's not your responsibility to deliver it to her at her earliest convenience. All it took was a few steps across the road and a knock on the door for her to pick it up, nothing worth throwing a fit over.", "NTA. You're already doing your neighbor a favour by accepting a parcel for them, and providing it a safe space temporarily. You can't be expected to do a second favour.\nIf you drop it to them, great, but for your neighbour to expect it is high degree of entitlement. I would refuse to accept that neighbour's parcels in future.", "NTA but next time say no", "NTA, you have a life too. You did a favor, sounds like this should be the last one for that neighbor.", "NTA - Are you in the US? Is it normal over there to expect your neighbours to deliver your parcels if they accept them? I live in the Netherlands and (at least in my neighbourhood) we receive a card through our letterbox telling us which house has our parcel and we go and collect it. Isn't that the same everywhere?", "NTA. Stuff happens to make people forget.", "NAH \n\nI can see both sides of the argument.

Making sure your 4 year old didn't have an accident was more important at that exact time. And it's understandable to get sidetrack by your normal after school routine.   \nIf she knew you had the parcel, she could've come over earlier too to pick it up.", "NTA that would be the last time I'd ever do her a favor.", "NTA. You are not a mailman, and likely did her a favor. Had you declined would it have been returned and re-delivered on a different day? Ultimately you probably saved her time.", "NTA. If someone is kind enough to take in a parcel for you then you should always go over and collect it if you know they are at home. They are doing you the favour not the other way round! I will drop off parcels as well as I take a lot in for my next door neighbour but they are super night and our front doors are at the side of the house and face each other so it\u2019s never a big deal if they haven\u2019t collected it.", "No, it was incredibly entitled of her to expect delivery from you. NTA", "No I live in UK and we also get a slip through the door to say that the parcel has been given to a neighbour or delivered to a safe place. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but personally I would always go and collect!", "This probably varies by location but everywhere I've lived (UK, Germany, Austria) it's normal procedure that the intended recipient approaches the person taking care of the package, since the person taking care of the package is the one who's doing a favour for the intended recipient.", "That's so odd. I'm from the UK originally as well and we always used to go and pick up our parcels as well. If someone's good enough to accept a parcel for you, it's a bit much to expect them to deliver it to your door as well. If she says anything again, just ask her if there's anything else she expects from you. Does she want you to do her shopping for her, cook her dinner, do her ironing haha", "Lol, incredibly odd... I'd say here the onus is on the receiver to collect. Sure, it's nice of the neighbour notices you're back and lobs in in your general direction, but usually it'd be the receiver who would come and collect.", "Lol NTA. DON'T accept her parcels anymore. If she dislikes the time frame she can try collecting from a locker or post depo.\nI say this as someone in the UK who regularly takes in parcels for neighbours and vice versa. We'd all be mortified at this behavour.", "NTA - in future ask what neighbour it\u2019s for and say no.", "I wouldn't take her packages anymore. She can figure something else out. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou did her a favor. She should be grateful.", "NTA - let their shit get stolen next time.", "NTA! Who does she think she is?!", "the only times we haven't gone to collect is when we've been given someone else's parcel by mistake (eg we're 225 and sometimes get 255's by accident) bc then there's no note. this is really weird behaviour from her imo!", "NTA. \n\nShe still got it the same day it was delivered. If you had left it for a week, you might have been in the wrong. \n\nYou just provided a luggage minding service for free- anything less than gratitude makes her the AH.", "NTA no more taking in parcels for her", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would YOU drop off the parcel. THey should come and pick it up from your place. You were already generous to accept it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But since your neighbor is that kind of aH, stop accepting parcels for them.**", "NTA. You did her the favor. She should have come over to get it when she saw that YOU were home. Not the other way around."]}
