I encouraged her to move in with me and said she could stay until she had the baby and managed to find something that\u2019ll help her on her feet. \nFast forward for months and I\u2019ve never regretted it more. Within the first 2 months I was already ready to kick her out. She never cleans up after herself and blames it on the pregnancy which means that when I come back from my 9-5 I\u2019d have to clean the whole house, make dinner (which is always her choice) and clean up after dinner, then do my work whilst attending to her needs. The needs aren\u2019t even difficult for her to do. From month 3 onwards she\u2019d have different men over every other week, probably fucking them and not even in her room but around the whole house, and I\u2019d also have to clean this mess up too. Last week I confronted her about it and she said it was my responsibility since I came up with the idea and that\u2019s I\u2019m her older sister. We argued about it and soon I realised her mentality and that was the last straw for me and I kicked her out that night and now she\u2019s living with our cousin. \nYesterday I went over the argument and am starting to feel guilty about my verdict but it was a very strenuous 6 months for me. Am I the asshole?\n\n\n\nEdit: She was having guys over and fucking them but not every time, when they weren\u2019t they\u2019d hang out and make a mess of the place. I\u2019ve spoken to my cousin about getting her in line in preparation for looking after the baby. I\u2019ve also said that I\u2019ll allow her to come back once the baby is born but I\u2019ll be more cautious and strict about her stay.", "created_utc": 1667562803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylwz21/aita_for_kicking_out_my_pregnant_sister/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You signed up for giving her a place to live, you didn't sign up for being her care taker.", "NTA\n\nIf she can bang randoms then she can clean her messes and cook. \n\nShe was using her pregnancy as an excuse. \n\nShe was being a lazy mooch. \n\nI bet you that once the baby was born you too would be on baby duty so that she can live that 21 year old youth phase.", "NTA. But I really feel bad for that baby because your sister expects everything to be done for her, and I hope she can shift into becoming the caretaker.", "NTA. Siblings aren\u2019t our slaves to do our chores, especially if they already help us out. But I\u2019d say pregnancy is getting difficult with months. My wife didn\u2019t do most chores when her pregnancy became more pronounced and I would not ask her to. But it seems your sister was enjoying her stay.", "NTA. If she can have men over for sex, she can help around the house. She totally took advantage of your good will.  I suspect that's why her ex didn't want anything to do with her.  Is she capable of taking care of a baby?", "NTA.\n\nIf she can't even clean up after her own acts of intimacy, she doesn't deserve your hospitality.", "NTA You gave her a good chance, she pissed on your generosity. No guilt necessary on your part (that belongs to your sister), just enjoy your well earned peace and quiet.", "NTA. At all. Had you not kicked her out, you do realize you\u2019d be caring for a new born as well.", "IMO NTA, it's your house and your sister was taking advantage of your kidness", "NTA in any way, shape, or form. She should have been so thankful that you offered her a roof over her head and food on the table that she should have been cooking, cleaning, and whatever else she could do to help. She's not entitled to anything from anyone, even her sister. And to disrespect your home in that way is disgusting. It would only have gotten worse after the baby.", "If it wasn't for the having men over constantly I'd call you TA, since she's arguably going through a very hard time in her life. But holy shit she's out of control and seems to have 0 remorse or empathy. Was she always like this or it is a new thing?\n\nINFO\n\nEDIT: elaboration on why i'm asking for info.   \nyou sister seems completely unhinged. if she was always like this or had a tendency of entitlement and shying away from personal responsibility then i think you're very justified. if this behaviour is new that might point to get really not being in her right mind, which would mean you should be patient and try to get her out of it.", "NTA. You were very generous offering her a place to stay and she took advantage of that. Just because she's pregnant does not mean she can't clean up after herself and can treat you like her personal maid. I honestly commend you that you put up with it for a whole 6 months, I don't think I would last 6 days. \n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty about. You tried to help but her attitude towards you and your home is unacceptable.", "NTA she has a whole lot of issues going on. Are you ready to take in the baby? You need to be thinking about that. She\u2019s not going to want to be a mom to a crying needy newborn.", "NTA\n\nBeing pregnant does not equal being incapable of doing basic chores, working and respecting house rules.", "NTA\n\nHaving a revolving door of men through your house? What is she hoping, that they'll swoop in and rescue her? That's where I'd draw the line too, but it's pretty clear she has no intention of job hunting or getting a place for herself.", "Hell no NTA. Do not feel guilty over ungrateful freeloaders. She made her choices, now she has to deal with the consequences.", "So she\u2019s 5-6 months pregnant and fucking a bunch of men?  That seems dangerous, I\u2019m not arguing chastity, but what if she catches something that could harm the baby\u2026 \n\nAnyway, NTA.  You tried to do something nice and someone took advantage of it, you have to stand up for yourself sometimes.", "So NTA, you wanted to help and give her a place to stay in the short term. In all honesty if that was me, I would have been grateful, help around where I can, nils is possible, house work, meals.\n\nShe has taken advantage of you and felt it appropriate to bring stranger into your home without consent from you.\n\nHer attitude that she asked her to move in and such your responsible to weight on hand and foot, it\u2019s completely outrageous and out of order. \n\nIn end, it has done too far and you needed her to leave and she has had months to sort more permanent solution which she has not done which is her own fault. If you had left it longer and she had the baby, then it would only get worse and she would use emotional blackmail to stay and if you kicked her, people would up in arms about. \n\nSo you have given her a chance which ignored and has to deal with the consequences", "\"From month 3 onwards she\u2019d have different men over every other week, probably fucking them and not even in her room but around the whole house, and I\u2019d also have to clean this mess up too.\"\n\nShe was having strangers at your house too?  Hell no.  NTA."]}
