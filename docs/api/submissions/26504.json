She\u2019s had several miscarriages, and even this baby was born 6 weeks premature.  \n\nUnderstandably, she\u2019s being very precautious about who is able to meet the baby due to the surge of the flu and COVID. \n\nMy husband and I are also expecting our first baby, but we\u2019re not due until November. This was a planned pregnancy and we found out we were pregnant soon after my sister announced her pregnancy.  She was very excited to share the journey together.  \n\nBefore we had our baby, my husband and I planned a couple of last minute trips for ourselves.  We want to enjoy the last remaining months of being able to travel without the stress of baby while we still could. \n\nMonths ago we discovered there was going to be a showing of our favorite play in a city 5 hours away, so we booked a fancy hotel, made dinner reservations at a nice restaurant, and took a couple days off to go. \n\nThe day we checked into the hotel, my sister\u2019s water unexpectedly broke and she went into labor. She immediately called me and wanted me to drive the 5 hours back home. I asked her if I needed to be there, but she said the hospital was only allowing 3 people in the room with her, and one wouldn\u2019t be me. So I told her I didn\u2019t want to waste the thousands of dollars I spent on my trip to go to waste. \n\nShe said fine, but that I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to meet the baby because I was traveling and who knows what kind of diseases I was going to pick up. I told her I understood, and wished her the best and to let me know how it went. \n\nThankfully she had an easy labor and my nephew was born a couple hours later.  She FaceTimed my husband and I telling us how it was a shame we couldn\u2019t meet him until we quarantined for 2 weeks. We said we were more than happy to wait. \n\nIt had almost been 2 weeks when received a call from a close friend of ours who lives in a city 3 hours away that her husband, one of my husband\u2019s close college friend, passed away in an accident. The funeral is Saturday (today), so we made last minute arrangements to go.\n\nNow my sister is blowing up our phones and demanding we don\u2019t go because we will have to wait another 2 weeks to meet my nephew. I told her, once again that we don\u2019t mind waiting to meet him but she\u2019s saying that we don\u2019t care about him. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t expect her to change her plans because of my baby so she shouldn\u2019t expect us to change ours because of hers.\n\nMy parents aren\u2019t siding with either of us, which is making her even more upset.\n\nSo AITA for not changing my plans to make my sister happy?", "created_utc": 1694244167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dzcmh/aita_for_not_changing_my_plans_to_accommodate_my/", "score": 1711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The passing of your friend of course was unexpected.  You cannot miss giving your condolences.  Thankfully your nephew is happy and healthy, two more weeks won't cause an issue.  Your sister is understandably disappointed in the delay, but she needs to be realistic and understand the world does not revolve around her and baby.", "NTA. You couldn\u2019t have foreseen having to go to the funeral (my condolences) and it wouldnt have been fair for you to lose out on your trip and money. Besides, you were already out of town when the baby was born, so you might have still had to quarantine anyways.", "NTA it's a newborn baby.  You coming over to see it immediately isn't crucial to anything.  Like she can be upset that she wants you to meet it I guess sure.  But you have your own life and it's not like you're saying \"I want nothing to do with this baby.  Do not try to thrust familial pressures onto me wench!\"  \n\nWhat?  Is it gonna remember that you weren't in it's 1st month of existence?  No it's a baby", "NTA\n\nYou asked your sister if she needed you when the baby was born, she said no. So you continued with your plans.\n\nIt's unfortunate that a friend died and I'm sorry for you & your husbands loss.\n\nYour sister is the one who is Insisting you quarantine before meeting the baby. You're respecting her boundaries.\n\nYour baby is due November right when there usually winter viruses. I'd tell her the same information, any bugs, travel etc... she has to quarantine.", "NTA, life happens ofc she cant expect you to just ditch out of a trip just to sit in a waiting room, and then you followed her request to wait 2 weeks. Its noones fault that the funeral was when it was and ofc it makes sense for you to go. I dont understand why your sister is freaking out about you following the rules shes set out? She cant try and enforce a 2 week quarantine and then try and complain that you arent visiting.", "NTA and your sister is being manipulative. You\u2019re driving a couple of hours away and you could as easily catch covid in your local gas station. \n\nShe can set all the boundaries that she wants and you\u2019re free to live your life as you choose. I feel like she\u2019s going to isolate herself if she won\u2019t let anyone meet her baby if they have left a one or two hour radius from their home.", "NTA You have a lifetime to spend with your nephew. You only get one chance to say goodbye.", "NTA.\n\nThe death of a close friend trumps the birth of a baby.\n\nThere will be other opportunities for you to meet the baby. The occasion will be no less joyous because you had to wait two weeks, or four weeks, or even six months. You can Zoom or whatever in the meantime to keep up to date with developments.\n\nIn contrast, this may be the only opportunity you ever have to gather together with all the people who loved your husband's friend and are mourning him. It will certainly be the only chance you have to hug and comfort each other while your grief is still fresh.\n\nIn particular, the widow may need you, and if she does, she will need you in a way that your sister does not. Your sister would **like** you to meet the baby as soon as possible, but it sounds like she has sufficient support that she doesn't **need** you to.\n\nThe visit to the baby is a thing that can be postponed. Attending the funeral is not.", "Lmao you were already travelling and checked into the hotel when she called you, so no matter what, you would not have been able to see the baby if you left right away. She\u2019s having massive main character syndrome. Yes, you love your nephew, you are respecting all of her requests for his safety, and I\u2019m sure you will be present in his life. But people only die once. You should honour your friend any way you see fit. Nta.", "She\u2019s likely coming off her pregnancy and postpartum hormones, but there is no good reason that you guys need to meet the nephew asap unless he\u2019s dying or something.  I think it\u2019s awesome that you guys are willing to just quarantine until she\u2019s comfortable, but she doesn\u2019t have control over your movements or plans, just over access to her immediate family, which again, you guys seem very willing to work with her on that\n\nNTA", "NTA. The whole \u201cYOU GOTTA MEET THE BABY\u201d thing gets intense and there\u2019s plenty of time. Having said that, give her a break and realize it\u2019s likely an incredibly emotional time for her. Do your best to accommodate and understand, but I see no wrong on your part here.", "NTA.  Your sister's logic doesn't make sense.  Just traveling somewhere isn't inherently more risky than, say, going to a movie.  Plus, she was actually fine with the fact that you traveled to see a play, she just was upset when you wouldn't leave immediately.\n\nSo she says that you can't see the baby because you were traveling, but you actually can't see the baby because you didn't come home the moment she wanted you to.", "Your parents don\u2019t need to side with anyone\nYou\u2019re adults you will make your own decisions regardless of who\u2019s \u201cside\u201d they\u2019re on. \n\nNTA.", "NAH, but this seems to be more then you haven't met your nephew. Your sister is in the thick of the \"fourth trimester\". Since your pregnant with your first child you have no idea what is coming your way. She taking care of a baby that wakes up every 2 to 3 hours to eat. She's bleeding. It feels awful down there or she is recovering from major surgery. Her entire day to day routine has completely changed. She could be experiencing ppd or ppa. Both of those will make you have some crazy thoughts. So while for you it's not that you don't love your sister and nephew it's that during the delivery there was nothing that you could do, and you can't force people to die on a timeliness. But for her it may very well be my sister hates me, she avoids me and chooses everything of me. She's always hated me and has been waiting for the worst time to show it. And if my sister hates me maybe the whole world hates me.", "How dare you follow her request!\n\nNTA\n\nYou didn't time her early labor, you did not time your husband's friend's passing. That's just life.", "NTA. You've got your own life to deal with.  Sister needs to accept that.", "NTA. It's a baby. All you are going to do is look at him, talk about him, ask how your sister is coping, lie and say he's beautiful. You can do all that over Zoom. If your sister is that worried about germs, she isn't going to let you hold him. The baby won't remember who was there in that first month. It's like the first birthday party. It's more about the parents than the child.", "NTA\nYes, it's absolutely the right thing for your sister to protect her baby but she can't control you in the process. You sister is obviously very excited about her baby and she expect everybody else to make tumhe baby a priority, that's simply not possible for others. I have a feeling this is going to be an ongoing thing when your baby arrives as well and sister will continue to give unreasonable orders and be prepared for the inevitable \"I've been a mother longer than you\". Go to the funeral, your nephew actually remember these fews weeks.", "NTA I didn't meet my niece until she was 6 months old because that's when I could make the trip. The world didn't end, I still bonded with her, etc etc. Sorry your sister has a main character fantasy", "Where does this idea come from that the whole extended family needs to sit in the waiting room or even be in the delivery room when you give birth? In my country your spouse (or one support person, if you're a single mom) is in the delivery room and friends and family get a phone call / text after baby is born and the new family has rested and recovered. The closest people visit the next day. I was NOT ready to see anyone but my husband right after delivery.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It is a good idea to adhere for the 2 weeks after going to events like funerals but she shouldn\u2019t be pissed at you for it. Honestly 5 days is probably good to see if you\u2019re sick.", "NTA\n\nSister can set up whatever rules and boundaries she needs to feel safe. \n\nShe can insist that people respect those boundaries. \n\nShe CANNOT dictate what other people do with their lives.  She can only control what she will accept near her. \n\nYou\u2019re respecting her boundaries of not meeting the baby when you\u2019ve gone to another city. That\u2019s all she can demand. She cannot demand you meet the baby while also keeping her initial boundary. She will need to wait.", "Your parents are right not to take sides. Your sister is probably feeling very emotional given her previous history. Hormones will be running riot with her! Unfortunately you and your husband have had a tragic experience outside of family that you've had to contend with. It will all work out fine in the end. You've been very respectful and understanding of her wishes. Please take care of you in these last few months too as no one can predict how you're going to feel after you give birth. Good luck and enjoy having your children growing up together \ud83e\ude77", "Coming from a mom of two, newborns are blobs. They ain\u2019t going anywhere any time soon.", "You're NTA but can I suggest maybe phrasing your reaction as \"We respect your boundaries but we're sad we will have to wait a few weeks more to meet the baby!\". Postpartum mothers can be a prone to dramatics and anything that doesn't feel like an outpouring of love can feel like rejection.", "NTA! \n\nYour sister is just mad that she tried to call your bluff with boundaries for meeting her baby and you\u2019ve agreed and adhered to them without kicking up a fuss. \n\nTbh, whilst her \u2018rules\u2019 are reasonable for meeting a new baby, she only put them in place when you didn\u2019t immediately drop your pre-made plans and race to sit outside the hospital. She would have been more than happy for you to have a peek if you\u2019d have dropped everything for her whim (bearing in mind you were already in the city you were travelling to and pretty much as exposed as you were going to be), but now she isn\u2019t because you\u2019re daring (sarcasm!) to have your own lives and not be at her beck and call. \n\nI honestly think that you are as well to discover this now and not when she expects your baby to be in constant isolation just so your LO is at the beck and call of her/her child - use this knowledge wisely because very soon her demands are also going to impact your child.", "Definitely NTA your sister is. Unexpected things happen all the time.  And it is not like you didn't want to meet the little guy. There is also a such thing as FaceTime or video chat.", "It sounds like your sister is struggling with post-partum emotions and she isn't feeling prioritised, centred and supported. Rather than expressing that to you and people around her so she can work through her feelings, she's using her child as a bargaining chip.\n\n\"Cancel your holiday or you won't get to meet my child. Cancel attending the funeral or you won't get to meet my child.\" Obviously COVID is cushioning her request into seeming reasonable and heath conscious, but at the heart of it she is trying to use her baby to get the attention/ prioritisation she wants.\n\nObviously you're NTA but I have to ask, where's the babies father in all this?", "NTA\n\nI take it neither she or her husband are leaving the house or letting anyone visit?  Or expecting any visitors to avoid all other human contact for a fortnight too, given that they could contract covid at their local grocery store just as easily as the next city or state over.  I understand her wanting to protect her baby, she\u2019s been through enough to have him and he arrived so early, but she doesn\u2019t get to create firm boundaries/rules and then not expect life to go on for everyone else outside of that bubble.  Her hormones are possibly running rampant, combined with the overwhelming relief of finally having her baby after the trauma of her journey to motherhood, but she is not the centre of the universe and allowed to demand other people to stop their lives.  She\u2019s being unreasonable but she can\u2019t see that at the moment, I hope she mellows soon.", "NTA.  The baby won\u2019t care if it takes a few weeks before you see him.", "NTA. Timing is everything, and your time is highly sought after. You are following her rules and not getting upset over your inability to physically be with your sister due to her own choice shows your maturity.", "NTA, clearly, though I am curious. Does she demand that you quarantine in your house for two weeks, so also not working and meeting other people before you see her child?", "NTA. The world does not revolve around your sister and her baby.", "NTA, your sister is being ridiculous. It's OK to worry about the baby's health and minimize all contacts for a few weeks, but it's her decision. You don't need to put your life on hold to satisfy both your sister's paranoia and child-like egoism - you are to become a mother soon, of course her baby will not be your priority! There is no bonding with a baby who is a few weeks old for someone who just meets this baby once in a while. She needs to calm down, make up her mind about visitation rules without bothering you and accept that strict rules might lead to no visitation at all.", "NTA at all. In both cases, it was unexpected. You shouldn't waste so much money when your sister doesn't want you in the hospital anyway. And if she can't understand prioritizing a funeral, it's on her. Maybe it's postopartum hormones, but your sister sounds incredibly entitled and selfish.", "NTA. she set a rule and you both are being respectful of it. That means you care about her and your nephew. she\u2019ll be ok.", "NTA, it would not be right if you did not attend the funeral. The baby is going nowhere. 2 more weeks is no big deal!! It seems your sister thinks the world revolves around her!!!!", "NTA and it looks like your sis is expecting to be treated like a damn princess over her miracle baby.", "NTA / I think you have the right mindset. You aren\u2019t trying to change her mind about quarantining, so you live your life and accept her rules. Seems very fair to me.", "NTA. She\u2019s going to rag on you for going to a funeral? \n\nI\u2019m a germaphobe and I totally understand her paranoia, especially for a premie. Couldn\u2019t you just offer to wear an n95 when meeting the baby? Even if it feels like overkill, at least you\u2019re making her feel like you care - which you do! You can\u2019t really help these situations. \n\nTry to remember, she\u2019s CHOCK FULL of hormones and sleep deprived, and she\u2019s upset because you\u2019re important to her and she clearly wants you do have a wonderful relationship with her baby. Which I\u2019m sure you will if you try not to rise to her hormonal dramatics ;-)", "NTA. Your sister obviously is used to getting everything she wants. This will be good for her in the long run.", "Someone died. There\u2019s probably only going to be one funeral for that. Baby seems fine and there will probably be multiple opportunities to spend time with them. NTA", "NTA when her water broke you were already hours away and would lose thousands when you wouldn\u2019t have even been in the room with her. Now an unexpected death that funeral can\u2019t be redone later when is more convenient. Your sister is just mad because she wants you to drop everything and prioritize her and seeing her baby.", "NTA your life doesn't revolve around your sister or her kid.", "NTA. Since he's a premie, and we're about to head into flu season, it would be wise for sister to hold off on anyone meeting the baby right now, regardless of vaccines and quarantines. And it's not like you don't want to see her or the baby, it's that life happens, shit happens, and you have to put things on the backburner.", "NTA, the baby has who it needs at this time,  mom and dad.  \n\nYou can't help it you had a friend die.", "NTA You lost a friend. It's not like you decided to go on vacation.", "NTA she set up quarantine rules. She cannot be mad if you are abiding to her rules. She sounds entitled. You\u2019re supposed to cancel your vacation or skip a funeral so you can meet her baby? It\u2019s not like the baby is going to remember if she met you on Day 1 or Day 30. Your sister expects you to arrange your life around her baby. She is going to be in for a shock when you have your own baby.", "NTA. What does quarantine for two weeks even mean? Like once you get home from being 5 hours away, you have to stay home 100% for two full weeks?! Or you're still going to work, gym, grocery store, etc. but in your home area? It doesn't even make sense at this point.", "NTA How come it would\u2019ve been OK to drive straight there without quarantining, but because you didn\u2019t, you had to quarantine? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I\u2019m either misunderstanding something, or that\u2019s a pretty arbitrary exposure.", "Nta in this case, it's funeral! Your sister is overreacting. Your nephew won't know the difference.", "We didn't even let our siblings meet our babies till they were all 4 weeks and vaccinated. But we didn't care who was doing what or where. No kisses on the face and ya good. NTA she made her own rules.", "NTA. If she continues complaining, tell her you\u2019ll see her at his high school graduation.", "Nta it\u2019s a funeral and you\u2019re paying your respects. It sounds like she is having an emotional reaction to everything because she\u2019s going through something. It isn\u2019t really going to be logical so you kinda can\u2019t reason with her. You\u2019ll just have to get used to this being brought up again and again by her.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has somehow managed to grow up without realizing thar sometimes shit happens that ruins plans. She better start practicing her coping skills,because when you have kids, you have to revise plans on the fly.", "NTA.  I\u2019ll never understand why so many people think their baby is so important to everyone else.  I get that she\u2019s excited and you seem very happy and excited for her but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to drop everything because she had a baby.  She should really focus on this special time with her baby.", "NTA\n\nFather to a extreme premium here ( 26 weeks ) . Yes when they come home, best to allow immune systems to build a bit as they have been in a heavy sterile enviro ( NICU ). Recommend a month but then you should be exposing the child as normal unless there are medical reasons no to as they need to build immunity via exposure.\n\nIf thier child was NOT in the NICU ( 6 week prem babies are normally fully viable without needing extreme care ) , then the two weeks is plenty already and they are being over.", "So you weren\u2019t her birthing partner or going to be in the room but she felt she was entitled to demand you return from a paid weekend away to simply wait for her to have the kid. Nope not a chance I never met my nephew for about a week or 2 after he was born and neither me nor my brother cared. I get parents think the world revolves around their kids and yeah their world does but the actual world doesn\u2019t and she comes across very selfish and spoilt. Stick to your guns and be prepared to throw this back in her face when the time comes. NTA.", "NTA. For the first out of town trip, you were already there, therefore according to sister's rules you would have needed to stay away anyway. As for the funeral, holy lack of perspective! It's not like you're ducking out on her for a spontaneous trip to Disneyland. Someone you and your husband cared about DIED. I get she probably misses you and wants your in person support and is disappointed by having to wait longer to see you, but these are her own self-imposed rules with no medical need. She can change that if she wants.", "NTA. If you didn\u2019t live near her, did she expect you to travel to her right away and then quarantine for two weeks?", "Lol. NTA.\n\nIs she for fucking real? Is there some reason the baby won't be around in two more weeks or the rest of his life?", "NTA. You will have many years to meet and interact with your nephew. \n\nA funeral is one day that will never be repeated is absolutely reason to delay that meeting. Consoling a close friend's widow *should* take precedence.", "NAH, except for the guy who died. How DARE he die before you can meet your nephew! Your sister is unbelievably self centered and needs to realize that life happens when you least expect it. NTA, but your sister is definitely an ass hole.", "NTA. She wants your husband to skip the funeral of a close friend of his, wtf. These are her rules and she is allowed to have them, but she doesn\u2019t get to dictate your life.", "NAH.\n\nI suspect that, in the back of her mind, she's still scared about losing her baby since she had so many miscarriages and this one was born prematurely.  That may be why she desperately wants you to meet the baby.  Emphasize that she's being a wonderful, caring mother who's doing a great job looking after her baby and you can't wait to meet him in a few weeks.  You might also want to remind her that the couple of week wait means that she and her husband will have a more established care schedule with the baby and having visitors will be less stressful.", "NAH \nThe sister is being irrational of course, but to me it sounds like the painful combination of baby blues, health scare and trauma from her miscarriages. She needs support, which, of course, does not mean indulging in her irrational behaviour. \n\nHow even are they supposed to quarantaine? I don't know OP's living situation, but unless they are never leaving the house, there's always a risk of catching some kind of infection. I would maybe suggest expressing the interest in the child (which she is afraid of losing!) profusely and talking about the possibility of face timing for the first couple of weeks. They could also support them indirectly by buying stuff and leaving it in front of the door, or by talking about possibilities to support them in general. I never even would think about not going to the funeral, the mere question is ridiculous.", "You are not wrong.  I\u2019m sorry about your husband\u2019s friend.  Death sucks.  Your sister is living in her own special bubble right now and unfortunately there is no navigating it.   Your parents are wise to keep out of this one.  You can anticipate your sister either (i) getting over herself; (ii) not letting you meet your nephew until thanksgiving or Christmas; and definitely (iii) she will tell you all the things you are doing wrong with your newborn and trying to enforce her ways.   If she wants to play the petty card, stay away from you and tell you that you will never meet her kid then let her.  Don\u2019t rise to the bait, wait for her to grow up.  \n\nCongratulations on the new baby!", "She is expecting two weeks of quarantaine? So 2 weeks no grocery shopping? Two weeks no work other thans wfh? \nReally?", "Let me understand this\n\nHER water broke unexpectedly. \n\nyour friend DIED unexpectedly\n\nHow does your sister handle things in her life that don\u2019t go to plan, I wonder????\n\nNTA. Congrats on the pregnancy and I\u2019m so sorry about your friend. Wishing you a safe and easy delivery and a smoother childhood with your kid and nephew when this all blows over", "Why don\u2019t you ask if there is a compromise? Assuming you have no symptoms of illness, can you meet baby outside after taking a covid test and you wear an N95? That would be pretty low risk for baby. Two weeks quarantine is not super scientific anyway unless you live in an isolated area with low rates and are travelling somewhere with high rates. You are just as likely to get sick living your regular life; I assume you aren\u2019t literally quarantining.\n\nNTA for changing plans. Your sister is allowed to set boundaries but you are allowed to live your life. If she doesn\u2019t like the consequences of her choices that is not your problem to solve. I wonder if you trying a little harder and showing more regret might go a long way towards assuaging her feelings though. \n\nInstead of \u00ab\u00a0you can\u2019t see baby for two weeks\u00a0\u00bb being met with \u00ab\u00a0that\u2019s fine\u00a0\u00bb (subtext: \u00ab\u00a0I don\u2019t care\u00a0\u00bb), I would try negotiating a compromise.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Deaths are usually unexpected, and you do need to go and share your condolences with his family.  You are fine waiting the extra two week period she is imposing, but she just wants you to do what she wants.\n\nGuaranteed this kid is going to have no rules or expectations.", "NTA, and smart parents for staying out of it.  Sister is just being overly emotional during the post-pregnancy hormone dump. Hopefully she sees reason.", "NTA. It\u2019s a funeral, she\u2019s being selfish. \n\nBut hey- don\u2019t say this again eh \n\n> She\u2019s had several miscarriages, and even this baby was born 6 weeks premature.", "It seems that she's more interesting in you meeting her baby then she does? Why is she mad that you'll have to wait two weeks, when it's something you obviously agreed to? I'm so confused. NTA", "NAH.  I think your sister is signaling that she wants to be a priority for you.  As others have said she\u2019s full of hormones, likely sleep deprived and has hurt feelings that the sister she was planning to share the experience with won\u2019t meet her baby for a month.

You can't exchange the opportunity to be able to say a final goodbye for the inevitable first of a lifetime of hello's.

If I can get that from your words, she can probably reach that same conclusion from your words, actions, history of behavior, and her own sensitivity, especially when flooded with emotions and hormones about how her life just changed forever. Whether that is accurate or not is in this particular situation completely irrelevant. It is a fact that with every miscarriage she didn't become a mother and you didn't become an aunt.

She videoed you the same day she gave birth so rules and distance didn't exclude you from the experience. Maybe you could have driven by where the baby was before leaving town so she could have shown him to you from 10ft away versus through a lens. Something that recognized her want for you to be around. If you haven't met the baby for safety, you probably haven't even hugged *her* after she achieved a seemingly hopeless and impossible achievement and milestone and miracle. That's what is hurting, especially because you're right there. If you were in a geographically distant location, she wouldn't feel she isn't a priority, no matter what went into your decision of when you scheduled the trip out to see her, because the trip would be for her.\n\nPlease congratulate your sister on my behalf.

She\u2019s had several miscarriages, and even this baby was born 6 weeks premature.  \n\nUnderstandably, she\u2019s being very precautious about who is able to meet the baby due to the surge of the flu and COVID. \n\nMy husband and I are also expecting our first baby, but we\u2019re not due until November. This was a planned pregnancy and we found out we were pregnant soon after my sister announced her pregnancy.  She was very excited to share the journey together.  \n\nBefore we had our baby, my husband and I planned a couple of last minute trips for ourselves.  We want to enjoy the last remaining months of being able to travel without the stress of baby while we still could. \n\nMonths ago we discovered there was going to be a showing of our favorite play in a city 5 hours away, so we booked a fancy hotel, made dinner reservations at a nice restaurant, and took a couple days off to go. \n\nThe day we checked into the hotel, my sister\u2019s water unexpectedly broke and she went into labor. She immediately called me and wanted me to drive the 5 hours back home. I asked her if I needed to be there, but she said the hospital was only allowing 3 people in the room with her, and one wouldn\u2019t be me. So I told her I didn\u2019t want to waste the thousands of dollars I spent on my trip to go to waste. \n\nShe said fine, but that I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to meet the baby because I was traveling and who knows what kind of diseases I was going to pick up. I told her I understood, and wished her the best and to let me know how it went. \n\nThankfully she had an easy labor and my nephew was born a couple hours later.  She FaceTimed my husband and I telling us how it was a shame we couldn\u2019t meet him until we quarantined for 2 weeks. We said we were more than happy to wait. \n\nIt had almost been 2 weeks when received a call from a close friend of ours who lives in a city 3 hours away that her husband, one of my husband\u2019s close college friend, passed away in an accident. The funeral is Saturday (today), so we made last minute arrangements to go.\n\nNow my sister is blowing up our phones and demanding we don\u2019t go because we will have to wait another 2 weeks to meet my nephew. I told her, once again that we don\u2019t mind waiting to meet him but she\u2019s saying that we don\u2019t care about him. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t expect her to change her plans because of my baby so she shouldn\u2019t expect us to change ours because of hers.\n\nMy parents aren\u2019t siding with either of us, which is making her even more upset.\n\nSo AITA for not changing my plans to make my sister happy?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Tell her that you still have plenty of time to meet your nephew. Your husband's close friend just died. You are adhering to the rules that *she* laid out by quarantining for two weeks after. You're happy to do that, but she doesn't get to dictate that you don't attend a funeral to mourn the loss of your husband's friend just because she wants you to meet the baby sooner. Your nephew's birth, while amazing and wonderful, doesn't take precedence over an unexpected tragedy and your husband/you getting time to properly mourn the loss of a friend. \n\nHonestly, OP, I'd prepare yourself for your sister to \"get back at you\" by \"slighting\" your child in the same way she feels you've slighted hers.

I imagine that's how she sees it.)", "So she was ok with you not quarantining the first time if you came home on HER schedule? \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your friend. You and your husband have every right to your decision to go mourn your loss. NTA.\n\nOn a side note, I do wonder how your sister came to interpret your decision as not caring about her baby (and probably also her by extension). I understand that was not your intent at all. Hope you can eventually sit down together to clarify. I\u2019m just so curious if her response is a pattern or pregnancy hormones. It sounds like she has had a pretty harrowing journey to motherhood from the multiple pregnancy losses to having a premature birth which I\u2019m sure was stressful in a lot of ways. I guess wondering all this to form a fuller picture. You are NTA and also I\u2019m not necessarily ready to label your sister as a jerk in the situation either.", "NTA, but I would bet she just feels lonely and wants to see you. She\u2019s put these rules in place to protect her baby and is standing by them, but she\u2019s freshly postpartum, hormonal as hell and likely just desperately wants some company. I would suggest her issue is far less about the baby. Maybe sending some meals or some other gestures to show you\u2019re still thinking of her and can\u2019t wait to see her will help?", "Compromise.\n\nWould wearing N95 masks when in the funeral and when meeting your nephew be acceptable to everyone?", "NTA. Honestly, your sister sound exhausting. Is she usually like this?  Could it be low mood related? Maybe she just wants to see her sister for a bit of companionship- it must have been frightening going into Labour 6 weeks early after having miscarriages. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should change your plans by the way. I don\u2019t think you should. Just wondering why she is being so tricky.", "I mean she's complaining because of rules that she set up. So there's that. But also I'd kind of understand if this was \"I can't come because we're going on the lash\"...it's not, it's a god damn funeral. The NOTION that \"my baby is more important than your friends funeral\" is just a joke....\n\nNTA. Simple really.", "NTA. Not going to lie, your sister sounds very selfish. You're fully respecting the boundaries she put in place, and she's still mad?\n\nSomeone died, ffs, it's not like you planned for that to happen.", "The 2 week wait period was intended more as a threat than it was a boundary to protect the baby. You\u2019ve followed and respected the rules she set but she still isn\u2019t happy. That is because she never expected you to go through with it, she clearly wanted you to drop everything to see the baby.", "Your sister's baby is hugely important to her and she wants to feel that he is hugely important to you. Guess she's not  ... and if you have to ask if you are an AH for not giving her that (\"no, we're fine with waiting\" ain't cutting it) then I guess you know the answer.", "NTA\n\nBut cut your sister a little more slack than usual. She FINALLY had a baby, but it has still been a scary process. Her emotions are probably on overdrive. Maybe take a little more time to say to her AND her husband - *We are so beyond happy to have nephew. I know you are disappointed that other things in our lives have kept us from being there with and for you. We don't take nephew's birth lightly, and we are very understanding and respectful of your need to keep him safe and healthy. Please know that we didn't make our choices out of lack of caring about your or nephew. We are going to support our friend right now, but we will look forward to seeing nephew after quarantine.*\"\n\nMaybe her husband will hear those words and help her get a better grip on her emotions.", "NTA at either time, I'd be at a close friends funeral myself. You can see the baby in two weeks but your husband's friend is gone.

It's really strange losing someone close to your age. \nDon't worry about your parents or sister. Nephew will understand if tell the story in 15 years. \nTake flowers to friend's mother.

Going with NTA....", "NTA.  Parents need to realize that most people are not as excited about their baby as they are.", "NTA.  She made the rules (rightly or wrongly) about quarantine, etc.  it\u2019s important to go to the funeral and say your goodbyes and support your friend.  It\u2019s also important to see your nephew.  You are respecting her rules.  If she doesn\u2019t like that you are respecting her, maybe she should change the rules", "NTA. \n\nI am wondering where your sister's behavior is stemming from, though. It does seem like your sister is using very indirect communication to possibly tell you that she wants you to care more and be more excited to meet your nephew in general. This could be as simple as showing some kind of emotion that you're sad the meeting keeps getting pushed off and expressing some kind of emotion that the timing of all these things is very unfortunate. New moms are super proud of their babies, and it sounds like it's been a difficult journey for her to have one. Again, NTA but I bet everyone would feel better in this situation with some more communication and owning some valid and real feelings y'all are having.", "NTA. You're all doing things the right way. Your sister is protecting her baby, as she should. You're enjoying your last time baby free, as you should.\n\nThe most important thing IMO, is your parents are staying out of it. As they should.", "NTA -\n\nI'd keep my distance from that women.  She seems to have problems.\n\nI think your \"go with the flow\" attitude is most likely to result in a happy life.   Sister sounds quite controlling.   She attempted to punish you with not seeing her baby when you didn't go to the birth, then that fell apart when you had to go to the funeral, now she's trying to punish you again.\n\nI might tell her \"bring the baby over when you think it and us are ready\".  Send the ball back to her court.\n\nIt's odd she's making this such a big deal.", "NTA. I get it I had my baby in winter of \u201821. I\u2019m incredibly anxious over flu/RSV/covid. But you have to live your life. If she keeps this up tell her you\u2019re happy to wait to until the baby has his two month vaccinations if that makes her more comfortable and that you\u2019ll also be adhering to her rules of quarantine when it comes to your little one.", "Nope.

They went through pregnancy together - which she was excited about after her multiple miscarriages, which tells me she\u2019s not a typically selfish person - and her sister missed the birth (understandably!) which was likely traumatic because six weeks early is pretty much an automatic NICU stay. So she\u2019s anxious to introduce her son and she probably could really use her sister\u2019s support right now. She\u2019s trying to do what\u2019s best for her premie baby\u2019s health, and putting her needs (seeing her sister) second. She got so close to being able to see her, only for another unmissable event to come up. Unfortunately, an event like a funeral can\u2019t wait, but it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s upset.

Pregnancy hormones are a bitch.", "Sounds like the sister has another reason she's not telling op", "We met our nephew at 6 months and our niece at just under 2 years old. The pandemic was a long time and we live 2000km away", "Actually she's probably right. HER pregnancy and HER life take precedence at the moment. Duh?", "That\u2019s true I didn\u2019t think about working from home I was just thinking about the things I have to do in my daily life. For me going on vacation would have me around less people lol", "Depends on the family, I've seen some pretty spoiled rotten kids.", "True.", "Depending on the parents, they can easily spoil but not expire in 3 years...", "Because that would uncover the real reason of \u201cI want to be fussed over and congratulated about (finally) having had the baby\u2014especially before you\u201d which is at the very least being the center of everyone\u2019s attention for a while.", "[removed]", "Because she\u2019s postpartum and her hormones are a mess and her baby after a loss is at a fragile state and there\u2019s so much going on and to think about that she doesn\u2019t know up from down and doesn\u2019t have the mindspace to articulate what she\u2019s really needing.", "Because humans aren't perfect, especially when it comes to recognizing their own emotions.\n\nAdd to that, many women are conditioned to put their needs to the side, to feel selfish for even saying something like \"I need support right now!\"\n\nEspecially when it comes to being mothers.  The baby's needs are always supposed to come first.\n\nOP's sister is societally conditioned to think saying \"I need help\" will be viewed as less important than \"don't you want to meet the baby?\"\n\nHumans are complicated, and that often leads them to act in ways that are blatantly stupid, if you're viewing it from the outside.", "My main issue is that this goes beyond simply being a bit self absorbed. If the story had stopped at OPs sister wanting her to cancel her vacation, I wouldve been firmly in the No Assholes Here territory. But a full lack of empathy irt to someone's *death* seems like its a bit more than just a problem of the current circumstances.", "Considering my mother had PPD with both of my brothers and I had to do my best to be there for her through it, given our location away from extended family and my parents having a poor relationship at the time, I clearly *do* have some idea \ud83d\ude44\n\nI'm fully aware that not every pregnancy is the same and that hormonal imbalances can hit people differently, however its never really enough to do a complete 180 in personality to the point where youre just...suddenly *devoid* of empathy irt to a damn *funeral* of your siblings friend. That just isnt really how hormones work. At most, it wouldve been a heel-face-turn she had in the moment. Doing it and then doubling down isn't a personality switch that happens out of nowhere.\n\nIt doesnt automatically mean shes evil or something, but chalking up that level of dismissal to \"hormone things\" is both misunderstanding how hormones work and seems very \"she is/was pregnant so gets a pass on any behavior.\" Because OP isnt wrong about her treating it like the world revolves around her and her baby. We can debate the reason *why*, of course, but it doesnt change what shes actually doing.", "It\u2019s reasonable to want to be fussed over and congratulated after having a baby.  Especially a pre term baby.", "Especially totally ignoring that you can catch Covid (or the flu which would probably be just as bad for her premature baby?) just as easily going to the supermarket next door.\n\nIt's understandable she's cautious, but she can't reasonably think people will isolate themselves or stop living their lives just to see her baby... and support can be given in other ways. She's also not a single-mum without a partner, so it's not like she's alone.", "I\u2019m not saying that it isn\u2019t reasonable, but sister seems to be taking it a bit further than usual."]}
