We did not exclude people, and created the FB group so they could invite people too. We just didn\u2019t want a bunch of random people coming. \n\nWell, my Grandma and Uncle have both posted it to their 500 friends.\n\nMy sister left a message on the group asking people not to post the invite outside of the group, as we wanted a headcount, and my sister called my grandma, and kindly explained how to delete her post.\n\nWell, my father received a phone call twenty minutes later, saying to put him on speaker or else he\u2019d show up at our house. He preceded to call us all selfish, and say we\u2019ve shut them all out of planning, and was mad that we chose a winery that only seats 200 people, instead the  trashy community halls he suggested. I got mad at him, saying my mother would be so disappointed, to which he said the feelings would be mutual, and told him that she would have cut him out of her life for how he spoke to us. He preceded to call us \u201clittle girls\u201d who \u201conly think of ourselves,\u201d and my sister told him to fuck off.\n\nHe hung up on us, leaving everyone pissed off.\n\nSo Reddit, ARWTA for how we handled this situation?

Losing his sister does not excuse that, and in fact could make it worse as he's lashing out at those she loved.\n\nResponding in kind was not great, but was so obviously provoked that I don't think any of you were AHs.\n\nNor were you AHs for choosing a venue you felt was right, nor for asking for a headcount. They can invite people, just through somewhat controlled means. He took charge of the catering; how is he not involved in the planning?\n\nDon't worry about what others think of the venue. If your uncle doesn't handle the catering, he's a huge AH. I can't imagine a 200-seat venue is not enough for a memorial for anyone not a celebrity, either.

Are you kidding me? As the daughter that would turn the day into shaking hands of lots of acquaintance and I'd guess even strangers telling you the same empty phrases over and over again instead of giving you a chance to share your feelings and loss with the people close to you that understand it. So let alone 500 People, that wouldn't even give you a minute per person if you plan for eight hours.   \n\n\nKeep your celebration to a head count you are comfortable with, keep it to people you are comfortable with.

First off OP I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nSounds like your Uncle wants a party instead of a Celebration of Life. 500 of their friends? This should be limited to people who loved your mother and close friends and family. 200 people is very reasonable, 500 is not. I\u2019m sorry your uncle chose to behave so badly when your going through such a difficult time.", "NTA. How is it unreasonable to not want more than 200 people at a funeral? That\u2019s already a huge number of people, and far more than could reasonably be expected to have had and maintained a genuinely close connection with your mother. \n\nThat is not a slight on your mum, I\u2019m sure she was wonderful and many people love her, but IMO a funeral should be for the people that are truly going to be affected by her death and a few people there to support the people most affected. Once you get past 200 how close could they have possibly been to your mother? Maybe there\u2019s a cultural difference but all the funerals I\u2019ve ever been to have been 100 people max in the service, then maybe a few more at reception as people pop in to pay respects but weren\u2019t close enough to warrant an invite to the actual service. \n\nIt\u2019s looking like I\u2019ll be in the same position as you in the near future, and I\u2019m the only child, but am still only thinking I\u2019ll invite my very closest friends, maybe 5, but definitely fewer than 10, and the rest will be people who actually know my parent. How do your Uncle and Grandma think it\u2019s reasonable to go into the hundreds for their personal guests? \n\nIt\u2019s already going to be a difficult and weird day, you don\u2019t want the pressure of playing host to a load of strangers.", "NTA, and honestly you might want to reschedule the whole celebration and either talk to the caterer personally and see if he'll work with you.  Or see what you can manage without him.", "NTA.  Tell your uncle that I said to Fuck Off", "NAH/ESH depending on how you look at it. I'm leaning towards NAH. - It's obvious that emotions are running super high given the circumstances and everyone handles grief in their own way.

Just remember while she\u2019s your mother, she\u2019s also his sister and her daughter.", "ESH\n\nI get the feeling that you are just as much a choosing beggar as your family is \"white trash.\" If your mother had certain wishes, she would have put that in her will.  Was there anything in her will about arrangements? Be honest. This isn't about your mom. This is about you. If you're really honest about it, what would your mother actually want? Would your mother want you looking down on her side of the family as white trash? Would your mother want to be at a place where her family would be like down on? Would your mother really want he friends to be left out? Or would your mother really want to be surrounded by the people she cared about in life? From what you said about your mother, she would want to be surrounded by the people she cared about. You're certainly allowed to arrange things the way you want. \n\nSure, it's not going to be a popular opinion.\n\nAnd at the very least, pay the caterer.", "No, she wasn\u2019t. But we have a very big family, and she was one of those really social people that made friends wherever she went. She also worked with many clients, for many years. A recent family member had over 500 people at hers, so we\u2019re trying to limit it to just people close with her, who she liked, before it reaches those numbers.", "1. I honestly do not know about the caterer. He\u2019s a close friend of my uncle and offered to do if for free up to 300 people. He owns it, and I guess makes enough money for it to not affect him. Also, he\u2019s making cost effective food, that does not cost a lot to make\n\n2. We are paying the location costs", "Thank you for your kind response. That is how I feel as well. We told my uncle that if they aren\u2019t happy, that they could plan their own, but we\u2019re told we we have to do things his way. \n\nI don\u2019t know if 500 people would show up, but when posting a invitation to 500 friend on FB, you don\u2019t really know, and we want people who actually knew her, not people showing up that she didn\u2019t even like", "In my own family we normally don't do celebration of life.  When my Grandfather passed away two months before his birthday though.  One of my uncle's decided we should do one for him on his birthday since the caterers had already been paid..\n\nI imagine the whole thing was in terrible taste.  Most the family did not go.", "This situation sucks though, in my opinion, I would delete the Facebook post because people will/have already seen it and if it gets out more then 200 ppl will definitely come. Delete and don\u2019t re post, only invite a select number of ppl.", "How are they \u201cchoosing beggars\u201d the OP mentioned they are doing this celebration at a place their mother loved, and wanted to honor her in a way that they see fit for her? The OP also mentioned that they are paying for the celebration, so wouldn\u2019t you think they should have a say in the event? They also never said they wanted people to be left out, they just wanted to make sure that the most important people in her life are there and that random people won\u2019t just show up for \u201ca party.\u201d They also never mentioned if they would end up paying/tipping the caterer, so that point is irrelevant.", "NAH.\n\nYour mother's family is clearly used to doing things a certain way. As you were saying, someone else had 500 people coming over. Your uncle is helping out with the catering so he clearly wants to be involved with the planning, etc. and has strong opinions on how everything should be done.\n\nHaving said that, you've every right to plan your mother's celebration of life the way you want to. The best way to go about is by  making it clear to your uncle firmly but politely that his assistance is only welcome if it comes with no strings attached. You may need a plan B for catering if your uncle withdraws his support though.", "You, your sister and your father sit down,\n\nyou three decide which people you want to have around you that day, you decide who is a close friend and who is just a friend and even less. \n\nClose friends get in, everyone else has can send you a card or give you a call.\n\nAnyone that's further removed than a first cousin is either a minor that is brought along so the attending person doesn't need a babysitter or was so close to your mother that the person can also be considered a close friend. \n\nTo everyone that's not a close friend or close relative you say: \"I am sure you understand what a hard time this is for us.\" Anyone that argues that you shut them out, only does so to play victim.", "That\u2019s what we were trying to do. I created a private group, and only invited people close to her, and then all of a sudden, they were posting the time and place all over FB. I am fine with them inviting people I missed, I\u2019d just like it to be in the group for the head count, and not for everyone to see", "She was your mother. You get more say in this. You absolutely do not have to go along with your uncle's demands. Call the caterer and explain that your uncle is holding the favor over your head and trying to use it to do something your mother wouldn't have liked. Try to work out an arrangement where you pay the caterer for the amount of people and size of celebration you actually want. He might be on your side, as what your uncle is doing is putting the caterer in a rough spot too by expanding the guest list.", "NTA but free is almost never worth it in situations like this", "NTA.  When my sister passed in 2017, my brother was really trying to be, 'Big Billy Bad-Ass\" and overrun all the planning; however, he kept forgetting, she had a 25-year-old son.  Whether we agreed with his decisions or not, that was his mother.  I informed my brother to STFU and, that he didn't have to include us at all in his decisions because we were not beneficiaries or next of kin.  So, no, NTA. It's your mother and the people you choose to include are what's important.  Your uncle needs to understand that, unfortunately, he really doesn't have a dog in this fight.  Sorry for your loss.", "Do you think this blowup may affect the catering arrangement since the caterer is a friend of your uncle's? I think this would merit confirmation so other arrangements can be made if necessary. \n\nSo sorry for your loss. Take care.", "They said the caterer is doing it for free, at his own cost, up to 300 people.  The caterer is a friend of her uncles. Which uncle? The uncle that she said all this to? The uncle, who is nothing but white trash? That uncle? So he can help them out by getting his friend to cater it, but he basically needs to mind his business about who is invited? The caterer is a friend of the uncle. The caterer is doing this for the uncle for the sister he lost. The caterer is not doing this for OP. \n\nIf you assume that at the low end, the catered meal could be at least $20 a person, her \"white trash\" uncle saved them $6000 and he's wrong cause he thinks there isn't enough room?"]}
