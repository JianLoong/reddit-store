A few days ago, I (30F) was leaving our small town to go to a metro-city hospital for a minor procedure. My father (58M) came to pick me up and drop me off at the airport. He was using my car while I was gone. He is very fit and strong and I am a small woman. I was struggling with my luggage, and he knew that pre-op, I should not lift extra weights, but he did not offer to help -he does these things often. In contrast, when my sister-in-law carries even a small bag of groceries, he runs to help. I was put off but did not say anything. My brother did the same thing again yesterday -he still helps his wife and female friends, but while he has relied on my affective labor for years, he has never paid anything back. I have learned to be very independent as a result, but being vulnerable pre and post-op made me reflect on this.\n\nOf course, this goes back to our entire childhood. My father worked less than my mom but never helped with any chores,  or childcare. Instead, he always gave her 'work': dinner parties, houseguests, etc. He was abusive to my mother when she protested -and at times, to me and my sister. He is the 'nice guy' for outsiders and has a respectful life. I remember my mom being completely submissive until I was 7-8, but after a while, she started fighting back, and she became a difficult person, abusive back in words with him (and often being short-tempered with us). While I do not justify what she did, she has apologized profusely in both words and practical ways. My father has acknowledged that he abused my mom and has tried to make amends, but he has consistently denied any abuse to my sister and I. They are still together, but the dynamic has shifted.\n\nLast night was one of those nights: I was not there, but have seen it play out. My father was passive-aggressive for days until my mother started arguing. Their argument turned into a full-blown one. Today, my brother who had never endured my dad's abuse, was sarcastic about my mom being a tyrant. I responded soberly to him that the women in our family have learned to demand to be treated with basic respect because asking nicely has not borne fruit. And I mentioned the luggage incident as a 'minor example' of what our mother endured for years. My brother responded that if this bothered me, I 'lack emotional intelligence.'  That hurt.\n\nA little later my father called and asked if he could talk to me. I responded that 'no, you cannot, until you become a better father to my sister and I; until you show to your son that he cannot call me emotionally unintelligent for expecting a strong man whom I have consistently served to lift my heavy-for-me luggage in return'. My father started crying and said that he knows he was wrong, but he has excuses and I told him 'sorry but' doesn't cut it anymore.

She was raised in a situation where gratitude and love were to be understood but never actively expressed. As a result, when we were little the best my mother could express in gratitude would be a deadpanned flat-toned \"that's nice, thank you\". She did not realize how much that dead-toned flat voiced expression of gratitude caused more harm than good. When I was about 8 or 9 years old I spent months doing odd jobs so that I could earn money to spend for buying Christmas gifts all on my own that year. I was exceptionally proud of the necklace that I had bought for my mom. When she opened it and gave that expressionless flat tone voice of hers, I was heartbroken, and angry. I ripped it out of her hands threw it across the room and demanded to know if she actually liked it why she couldn't show it. Told her just exactly how much her dead tones told us that she actually hated it. And then ran to my room and tears. My mom came to my room, held me while I cried, apologized to me, explained to me how she had been raised, and how she honestly had thought she was doing better just by giving what she had been. She promised me that she would work on showing things more. She spent her entire life my entire life after that working hard to show her feelings and her emotions more and more. She made it her life's work to improve. And I will always honor her for that.\n\nTell your father, if a woman who was raised from the time of the Great depression in institutions where love and emotions were not expressed could learn to truly show and express her emotions, then he a grown man can sure as hell learn to be genuinely helpful and non-abusive to his wife and daughters, and teach his son to be the same as he is going to learn to be!", "A million times, thank you for this.
