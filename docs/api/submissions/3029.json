A few days ago, I (30F) was leaving our small town to go to a metro-city hospital for a minor procedure. My father (58M) came to pick me up and drop me off at the airport. He was using my car while I was gone. He is very fit and strong and I am a small woman. I was struggling with my luggage, and he knew that pre-op, I should not lift extra weights, but he did not offer to help -he does these things often. In contrast, when my sister-in-law carries even a small bag of groceries, he runs to help. I was put off but did not say anything. My brother did the same thing again yesterday -he still helps his wife and female friends, but while he has relied on my affective labor for years, he has never paid anything back. I have learned to be very independent as a result, but being vulnerable pre and post-op made me reflect on this.\n\nOf course, this goes back to our entire childhood. My father worked less than my mom but never helped with any chores,  or childcare. Instead, he always gave her 'work': dinner parties, houseguests, etc. He was abusive to my mother when she protested -and at times, to me and my sister. He is the 'nice guy' for outsiders and has a respectful life. I remember my mom being completely submissive until I was 7-8, but after a while, she started fighting back, and she became a difficult person, abusive back in words with him (and often being short-tempered with us). While I do not justify what she did, she has apologized profusely in both words and practical ways. My father has acknowledged that he abused my mom and has tried to make amends, but he has consistently denied any abuse to my sister and I. They are still together, but the dynamic has shifted.\n\nLast night was one of those nights: I was not there, but have seen it play out. My father was passive-aggressive for days until my mother started arguing. Their argument turned into a full-blown one. Today, my brother who had never endured my dad's abuse, was sarcastic about my mom being a tyrant. I responded soberly to him that the women in our family have learned to demand to be treated with basic respect because asking nicely has not borne fruit. And I mentioned the luggage incident as a 'minor example' of what our mother endured for years. My brother responded that if this bothered me, I 'lack emotional intelligence.'  That hurt.\n\nA little later my father called and asked if he could talk to me. I responded that 'no, you cannot, until you become a better father to my sister and I; until you show to your son that he cannot call me emotionally unintelligent for expecting a strong man whom I have consistently served to lift my heavy-for-me luggage in return'. My father started crying and said that he knows he was wrong, but he has excuses and I told him 'sorry but' doesn't cut it anymore.

The problem with this particular behavior is that while I was conscious of not hurting myself as I was carrying the luggage (thus appearing more struggling), it only occurred to me later that my father was just standing there -this is indicative of the dynamic that has solidified over the years. It took me even more time to realize my brother had done the same thing, because with him, it's even more of a one-way relationship. \n\nI am just saying this because my inability to talk was not the result of an unwillingness to fix the relationship or to respond to his attempts to amend it -which should have been preceded by an acknowledgment of abuse (and I have asked him to do that unsuccessfully).
