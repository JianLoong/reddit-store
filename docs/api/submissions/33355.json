Approaching a very large,  outwardly aggressive dog while pregnant is pretty bonkers. Your job is to protect your wife and child.   You're not the A-hole for doing exactly what we're instinctually driven to do, which is also the right thing to do - attempting to protect your wife and child.  However.....I think she may have gotten her feelings hurt by the fact that now that she's pregnant you seem to be more protective, which could come off to her as she's less important than the baby.  So I'd talk with her and ask her how she felt about it. Then establish a clear understanding that, while it's your responsibility to protect her and the baby, you two are going to be together for the rest of your lives, and she is the most important person in your life. At times one or both of you may have to prioritize the needs of your child over the needs of each other, but you're both doing so because that's your job as parents - to sacrifice in order to raise good children, and someday that child will leave the house and it'll be just the two of you again, partners for life.", "NAH.\n\nI'm an animal lover myself, and would want to help a stray, but approaching a strange dog (especially a big one) is a dangerous thing to do for *anyone* when the dog is showing aggression.

According to Reddit, all dogs are perfect, fluffy, magical, fairy creatures which can do no wrong, and could never ever be dangerous. And if they were to do something, it would not be that serious, and if it is, it's your fault.", "NAH. You're right to want her to be safe and in your position I would have insisted on handling the situation even if she wasn't pregnant. I can also see her point of view, women tend to be overprotected, it feels controlling  and often is.

If she were 7 *weeks* pregnant and still at full capacity physically that would be different (though it would still be more serious if she were bit while pregnant than when not).

I guarantee she cares as much or more about the safety of her pregnancy as you do. Ignoring someone telling you not to do something you feel capable of isn't stubbornness.

Approaching a stray dog is always dangerous. So is driving. And walking down stairs vs taking the elevator. You can\u2019t try to limit what she does \u201cfor the baby\u201d because a) you will never run out of things to limit and b) it comes off as if you think she\u2019s incapable of deciding if a situation is safe for *her* let alone the baby she\u2019s carrying.\n\nShe\u2019s not a baby, she\u2019s your partner.

That being said, you're not gonna win this one.  When my wife was pregnant, I was always wrong no matter what I did.  It was frankly the hardest part of my marriage to-date by far.

If you let your wife approach the dog without you caring and she gets bit, then you\u2019d still be the AH for not protecting her and your child.

Everyone else trying to demonize you are very short sighted and making one small incident a gender war issue. This one incident isn\u2019t a stamp on how you feel about pregnant woman as a whole.

You handling the unknown animal - how does that look like? \n\nRe your wife, i think the way you came off is exactly how she felt you came off. You could word it better. Its already happened, its already over, theres no need to further admonish your wife. Instead you could've focused on similar scenario in future and discuss how you should approach it best because of what ifs and uncertainties on how some animals may react to smelling pregnancy.

I wanted to handle it for two reasons: my wife is 7 months pregnant and the dog was huge (at least 100lb and probably taller than me on its hind legs and I am 6ft). \n\nMy wife can be a bit stubborn when told not do something so completely ignored me. The dog did show some level of aggression such as barking and light growling. I backed off to make it feel less threatened. After awhile it did calm down and we were able to get it home.\n\nAfterwards I told my wife that she was being stubborn and reckless approaching an unknown animal like that while pregnant and that she should have let me handle it. She thinks I am being unreasonable and controlling. Things have been cold since. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH. You were looking out for her, but maybe a bit too much. Identify the risk and let her make her own decisions.", "NTA I'm reading the comments and I understand where they are coming from, but it's your child as well and you care about it, it's reasonable for you to be concerned. But like others have said she is not made of glass, just currently caring for two lives instead of one.", "I\u2019m torn because on the one hand, Y T A for making it about her being pregnant. But on the other hand, N T A for advising caution around a large, strange dog showing aggression. That should apply to everyone, pregnant or not. \n\nIdk I guess NAH is my vote. You\u2019re not wrong for advising caution but she\u2019s not wrong for being miffed you\u2019re making it about the pregnancy.", "YTA. Unless you can carry your child to term, you do not get to choose what she does in any capacity.", "NTA-but you probably should have avoided the dog too if it was that large and showing aggression or fear.", "I have giant breed dogs who don't know their own strength and can playfully knock me over. I'm not letting them anywhere near pregnant women, elderly or children. I can't imagine the damage they can cause if they were aggressive. \n\nYour intent was to protect your family while taking on the same stupid risks. In high stress situation, your response is understandable. \n\nNTA.", "YTA. Sorry to break this to you, but her body is still hers and you don't get to tell her what to do with it, even when it is baking a new human. Her choosing not to do what you want her to do does not make her stubborn.  It makes her a whole human with the right to make her own choices.\n\nIt is normal (and good!) for you to feel anxious about her health and safety when she's pregnant.  What you need to learn to do, however, is feel those feelings, and not make it her responsibility to make you feel less anxious by doing things differently than she has. \n\nLearn to quiet your instinct to be controlling, even when you think it is for a good reason. You will be a much better spouse and father if you do.", "NTA. I honestly can't believe so many people think you are. One of the main things pregnant women (esp in the last trimester) are supposed to avoid is anything that can cause them to fall or jostle them roughly... Ladders, horseback riding, skiing...

Maybe she needs to remember that getting knocked the fuck over by a large animal presents additional risks.", "YTA - \"when told not to do something\", in a word, yes. You're controlling.", "Is your wife one of those parents who would put their so-called 'gentle' dog in a cot with a baby?", "YTA stop telling her what to do and treating her like she\u2019s breakable.

Being pregnant doesn't automatically mean a woman is fragile and unthinking or unable to assess a situation and make decisions for herself.", "Yta, pregnant or not, she's still a whole grown-up, dude. I get that you feel protective, but you don't get to control her, or how she handles herself.  I caught a rattlesnake in my house and took him back outside when I was 7 months pregnant. I knew what I was doing, and being pregnant didn't change that.", "NTA, I have two big dogs who pulled me to the ground when I was pregnant. We were on a walk and they saw the fox before I did so I didn't react fast enough. Thankfully it was early pregnancy so baby was fine but I was pretty banged up. My husband  walked the dogs for the rest of my pregnancy. \n\nI love dogs and I too try to stop and help the wanderers, I don't think your reaction was bad. It's fine she tried and decided to go anyways, but nothing wrong with being concerned. I'm a lot more cautious around dogs myself now because you just don't know. Especially as if the dog has been lost for awhile, it'll be more scared and react differently", "NTAH", "A gentle NTA.

You approached the dog too. Why is it okay to put yourself in danger and not your wife? She might be the one who\u2019s pregnant but YOU\u2019RE THE FATHER. You think it\u2019s wrong she endangered herself, but you did the same thing and then turned to strangers on Reddit to validate your side. You keep saying your wife is stubborn, but in reality *you\u2019re* the stubborn one and you had better learn to grow up before the baby gets here. Apologize to your wife and do better in the future.", "NTA (although how you said it could have caused you to be slight YTA).  People sometimes don't realize their limits/limitations. It happens a lot of places - pregnancy/age/sickness. Later stage pregnancy causes a lot of body changes that can cause instability and balance issues that one may not even realize yet because they haven't been in specific situations. Not to mention if someone got bit, I'd prefer a non-prenant person due to the rabies shots. I get her annoyance - it sucks when people treat you like glass when pregnant. But it this case I feel you taking lead would have been warranted (though I agree approaching an aggressive dog is foolhardy by anyone) due to balance, her size (if she is smaller), and possible repercussions. Talk with you wife and ask if maybe you or others have been treating her too softly. Or if she has any other issues. I found by later stage in pregnancy, I started to feel like an incubator due to comments and was also frustrated when things I could do, I suddenly couldn't. Again, I see it many places.

That pissed me off beyond anything, still does.", "Did you make it seem like you were *only* worried because she was pregnant? Even though I\u2019m sure you care about her as a person outside of the baby thing, it might have seemed like you only cares about potential harm to the baby. I experienced some similar miscommunicated sentiments from friends and family during my pregnancies and while I knew they cared about me, it seemed a little crazy how that paled in comparison to the baby at times.", "NTA. You're a good husband and will be a great father!", "I got dragged in the street by my dog who has never done anything like that when I was 8 months pregnant. Animals are unpredictable.

Anyways, she's 14 now and neither of us were impacted from that (aside from my dislocated shoulder and black eye). I think her wanting to help out with something she is an expert in (as you said in your post, you both have done this before) is her prerogative. Your attempt although well meaning was very controlling. You're treating her as though she is an infant herself... not to mention you're already calling into question her ability to keep y'all's unborn child safe and her parenting decisions when the baby's not even born yet. That would be infuriating to any new mom.", "NAH. Not sure why so many people here think it\u2019s offensive for her pregnancy to be a factor. This dog clearly had the capability to hurt them, so why should OP not be concerned for his wife and unborn child? Yes, pregnant women aren\u2019t made of glass, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should throw caution to the wind and act as if your body isn\u2019t going through a lot.", "honestly, NTA. i hated being treated like i was going to break when i was pregnant but in this specific scenario that dog could\u2019ve done some damage. all it takes is missing one cue an animal gives for it to go sideways.", "YTA.\n\n1) Pregnant or not, you don't just tell your wife not to do something.\n\n2) she not sick.

I love dogs too, and if I saw a stray dog, I would want to get it to a shelter, but I know there is a chance I could get bit or worse. I wouldn't do that while pregnant. \n\nI'm not saying she's not allowed to do small stuff like cross the street by herself but she should be cautious more now.

Not to mention my round ligament pain made putting his harness on difficult.\n\nI don\u2019t think OP is unreasonable at all. I would not have approached a large, unknown dog while 7 months pregnant. Even a friendly dog can topple a pregnant woman over by accident. \n\nOf course OP\u2019s wife should do what she feels comfortable with, but he\u2019s not wrong to ask her to consider exercising some caution.", "He's not unreasonable to be protective of his wife and their child she's carrying.

You can't curtail her choices and wrap her in cotton wool to protect the baby because doing so would be unfair to her, the already existing person who needs to still exist as an independent person. \n\nDo you understand how much bodily autonomy she has already lost? This baby is loosening her ligaments, stretching her skin, sucking nutrients from her body, altering her hormones, and will leave her with permanent changes to her body. She is ALREADY sacrificing a huge amount of her personal freedoms just to have this child. \n\nRecognizing that, you should accept that SHE makes the final decision for what risks she will and won't accept while pregnant. She knows how her balance is feeling. She is the one who will bear any consequences. It's her call, not yours. Pregnancy and childbirth is NOT fair, so the person who is pregnant and most affected gets to make final decisions until the baby is born and life can even out.\n\nSo sure, you can raise you concerns. But if she doesn't agree then she doesn't agree and doesn't have to listen. Because she isn't just a vessel for your child, she is still an entire person with a life to lead and choices to make. She cannot put herself on hold for 9 months, that is not a reasonable request, so you need to accept that there will be trade-offs she makes in order to get through this time without sacrificing too much of herself in the process.\n\nYTA. Expressing your concerns was fine, but you don't get to hold her choice to live her life against her.

That wouldn\u2019t cause her any stress at all, or be bad for the baby. And assuming it\u2019s a really dangerous dog like you seem to think is possible, that would attack and kill someone trying to catch it, giving birth with no partner and a kid growing up without a father is totally fine!
