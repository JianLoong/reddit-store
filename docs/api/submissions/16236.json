We don't have kids together, but we both have kids from previous relationships.  I have a 19-year-old son who is in college.  My wife has a 18-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old son.  Both of my wife's kids live with us as their father is not very involved in their lives.  I have a good relationship with my stepson (Joe), but my stepdaughter (Beth) and I have always had a rough time getting along.\n\nWhen my wife and her kids first moved in with me, Beth was very antagonistic towards me.  I would try to plan fun things for the kids and I to do together, but Beth would constantly either ruin the event with her attitude, or refuse to participate.  I never pushed her to join us and chalked it up to normal teenage behavior.  I'll admit, the time Joe and I spent together during those first few years definitely helped us build a bond that is still strong to this day.  But Beth and I have never been able to build the same type of relationship.  She has told me on numerous occasions that I'm not her dad so I should stop acting like it.  \n\nBeth has gone through a rough few years since Covid.  She's struggled in school and with alcohol and drugs.  We've tried a lot of different things from therapy, counseling, punishment, etc.  Beth's behavior never changed no matter what we did.  This culminated in Beth getting pregnant a little over a year ago.  She insisted on keeping the baby, dropped out of school, and got a part-time job.  I was told by my wife and Beth to stay out of it as it's not my business.  \n\nNow, Beth has a 4-month-old baby girl.  She is not currently working and we are in the process of finding out who the father is (There are apparently 4 guys that she thinks it could be, we are working with a lawyer to get DNA tests done).  My wife has been helping Beth with all the baby stuff.  Since Beth has told me she that I should stay out of it, I've taken it upon myself to spend more time with Joe and make sure he gets to soccer practice and has someone at games to cheer him on.  \n\nThis past weekend, both my wife and Beth were exhausted because the baby hasn't been sleeping for more than 3 hours at a time.  My wife asked if I could take a turn with the baby so that both of them could get some rest.  But Joe had a soccer game that day and I told my wife I had already said I would take him and watch.  \n\nMy wife got mad at me and told me that both her and Beth are tired and need a break.  I asked if she had ok'd it with Beth that I watch the baby and she said no because Beth was asleep.  I told her unless Beth asks me herself, I am going to stay out of it like they both told me to do.\n\nShe accused me of playing favorites with her kids and that Joe would be fine if I missed one game.  She told me Beth needs more help than Joe right now.  I told her that's not Joe's fault and I'm not going to break a promise to him.  I ended up going to Joe's game and now my wife is barely speaking to me.", "created_utc": 1683052295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135w7kn/aita_for_not_helping_my_wife_and_stepdaughter/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Time for Beth to learn to adult.  She\u2019s already got it easier than a lot of new parents.  Not working,  no pressure to pay bills, her own mother helping round the clock.

It\u2019s not your obligation to help out and as someone who has had a baby, between 2 people it\u2019s manageable", "NTA - I\u2019m a firm believer that you should match the energy that someone puts into you, she can\u2019t treat you poorly then expect you to drop everything to help her out. \nHer actions have consequences.", "NTA, the baby has mom and grandma.  Two adults watching it. Since Beth was pregnant how many games has your wife been to?  As your wife is buying things for the baby how much has she bought for Joe, are you picking up the slack on what he needs?  Your wife needs to remember that she has a son as well.", "NTA.

It was your step daughter's decision to treat you the way she did so it's only right she puts her feelings aside and asks for help herself if she needs it so badly, it's her kid after all. Accusing you of playing favourites was a pretty unfair thing to do considering only one of your wife's kids gave you a chance to have a good relationship. I know Beth has her own reasons for feeling the way she does about you, it's never easy accepting a new parent figure into your life but she made her bed and now she must lie in it.", "Tough dynamics that took root over years. \\~ NTA\n\nBeth and wife expect you to be involved 'on demand'.

Malicious compliance.", "NTA, and I think you're right in asking your wife to clear it with Beth before you do anything with the new baby.  \nIf Beth asks for your help, you can be the grownup and help out.

You are doing the absolutely RIGHT thing by keeping a young mother off the street and with a support system. Your wife is acting entitled, and that's not you saying that, it's me. Tell your wife I said that. This baby has two adults who are taking care of it, that's standard, on top of the added benefit of actually more like 3 adults keeping a roof over it's head.\n\nBeth has needed more help than Joe for years, it's time the buck stops. She has made poor decision after poor decision despite having a robust support system. Paying lawyers to find the dad? 4 possible people? This is so irresponsible. Beth needs an ass kicking, preferably from her own mother. I hope Beth has been nothing but kind to you considering the new circumstances, you didn't mention that in your post so I assume she's \"turned the other cheek\" or at least come to her senses about what you're doing for her.", "NTA I mean the mother told you to stay out of it all.", "NTA. Both said the baby was none of your business. So if they\u2019re tired because the baby hasn\u2019t been sleeping more than 3 hours\u2026\u2026guess what? That\u2019s none of your business. Which means you don\u2019t have to do anything. They can\u2019t have it both ways. Stand your ground. If Beth wants to ask you herself to please help, she can do that. Otherwise respect her wishes and stay out of it", "NTA. \n\nThey should have thought about how their decision on not having you involved. Beth has obviously shown her true self to you many times, I wouldn\u2019t feel obligated to help her out either. I mean, she said you weren\u2019t her dad so I see no issue with keeping it that way. She\u2019s the one missing out on your love and support. You tried, she didn\u2019t.\n\nOne question I have though is if your wife had ever tried to talk to Beth about pushing you out? Because she had to see that you and her son were bonding and Beth was not having it, so how did she react to that in the past?\n\nStand your ground. Maybe when Beth starts maturing and wanting you to be in her life you can both start having a good relationship but like I said, you e done what you could.", "NTA\n\n1) you are doing exactly what they asked/told you to do and staying out of it.\n\n2) you seem to be the only one who gives a damn about Joe, your wife kinda sucks. Joe has also been through all the stuff his sister went through, though they may not have medically effected him, that all still effected his mood/schedule/life/living situation... \n\nI hope you, your wife and Joe also get/got some therapy for it all.", ">She's damn lucky you haven't kicked her out.\n\nI am not looking to throw a young mother and her baby out on the street.  I've had talks with my wife about what Beth's future is going to look like in our home because she's now an adult and I feel she needs to contribute to the household if she's going to continue to live here.", ">Is it possible you have been judgmental or unkind?\n\nI drank and smoked pot as a teenager, too.  I never judged Beth for doing those things.  But, I did punish her for bringing those things into our house when it is not legal for her to do so.  And I won't lie that my reaction to finding out she was pregnant was probably not the best.  I believe my first words to my wife upon hearing the news were, \"Well, I suppose it was just a matter of time.\"", "One, I wasn't about to take the baby with me.  If asked, I would gladly watch the baby at home, but I'm not taking it out into public by myself, I didn't sign up for that.  Two, Beth clearly needs all the sleep she can get right now and I wasn't going to wake her up to ask her a question that could possibly result in conflict.", "Oh I never meant to accuse you of wanting to evict her!  I just meant she should *appreciate* all you have done, keeping a roof over her (stupid ungrateful) head all these years, even now she is a legal adult  and has brought all this disruption and trouble on you. You have the patience of a saint as it is. Asking you to babysit as well would try even the patience of an actual saint in heaven. Bluntly, she hasn't earned it and she doesn't deserve it. Your practical contribution  is already generous: a home and legal advice.\n\nAs for your wife; sure she's tired. Sure she's thrilled to be a granny. But even she told you to butt out, so the hell with HER too. She got what she asked for.", "What exactly did you gain by throwing \"you told me to stay out of it, so I won't help you at all with the baby\" at your wife?\n\nWhat are you hoping to gain from the opinions of strangers who's moddo tends to be \"I don't owe anyone anything ever\"?\n\nAnd frankly, what part did you expect to play in your step daughter's pregnancy, exactly?", "How often does Joe get overlooked because his sister needs more attention?", "Mate, you're in a tough spot.  I'm a bare-knuckled negotiator, so ymmv, but:  I would flatly say that given Beth's behavior to date, they need to count me out on help and/or support.  Permanently.  She doesn't get to treat you like you're a complete asshole but then have her hand out for help, money, babysitting, etc.\n\nLife is flatly just too short to let people like that into yours.  We only get one trip, and it's a pretty minimum threshold to only allow people into your life that don't make it clear they want nothing to do with you, up and until they need something.\n\nAll that said, it's time for some tough conversations with the wife around what pooled finances are going to be used to support a kid that, well, is more likely than not to never work or have a decent job.  She couldn't handle high school and now has a baby?  Nothing is getting easier from here on out.  Are you game for living with a toddler?  I generally think once is more than enough for that experience, but it's your choice.  Either way, sort it out now.", "Quite right too. And once again we see how Beth fucked  herself up: she has trained you not to even offer to help because you know you'll get your head bitten off. She really is a disaster area.", "also it sounds like Joe is getting the short end of the stick from his mom. his sister had a \"tough few years\"- okay everyone did. I'm sure Joe did too. But it sounds like Beth got a lot of attention, especially from her mom because she was having a tough time, while Joe got what exactly.\n\nnow Beth has had a baby and still she gets Mom's attention because Beth needs Mom cuz Joe doesn't. Cuz he's the good kid?", "Why would he expect to play a role in his stepdaughter\u2019s pregnancy??", "Yes!  The squeaky wheel gets the oil, as usual.\n\nOP has been a wonderful father to Joe and his mother does not seem to appreciate it at all. Beth sounds like a nightmare, and OP has been a saint in how he's helped and tolerated her.", ">Beth sounds like a nightmare\n\nI won't lie, a small part of me was looking forward to her finishing high school and moving out.  Obviously, that isn't going to happen anytime soon.  Beth's behavior over the past few years has been the # 1 source of conflict in my marriage.  Honestly, I just kind of feel bad for her.  Her life is going to be so much more difficult now.", "I don't disagree. But your wife has to remember that she has another child and a spouse. (1) Her life isn't about Beth and, (2) at the end of the day, Beth decided that she was going to take on the task of being a teen parent.\n\nAnd that is a herculean task. And it's awesome that your wife is trying to make it a little easier. But it can't be at the cost of everyone else.", "The rest of her life is going to be a shitshow whatever you do. She refuses good advice. She consistently rejects and antagonises the people who try to help. She's out of control sexually. She is a risk taker. She makes appalling decisions. And now she's added a child to the mix. \n\n**You can't help Beth**, not really. You can't turn her into a functional adult. All you can do is limit the fallout. \n\nSo you need to decide how much you are prepared to help. You will have to draw a line in the sand one day, or she will drag you down with her. You are being a wonderful father to Joe, but once Joe's left home, I would cut off  Beth completely. And (unless she starts respecting and appreciating all you do, unless she starts to draw a line with Beth too) cut out her mother too. You need to get your own life back. Not to be the unappreciated slave of Beth and her army of  illegitimate children."]}
