I also disagree with everyone saying Y T A because you're \"asking her to change\"\n\nSome people don't know what it's like to grow up with strict parents. If they don't like something, then that thing never, EVER gets to happen again. The disapproval from serious and strict parents is crushing, and it cuts deep, even as an adult. \n\nIt's a form of protection, to adapt something or someone you love to them, so they approve of the person you love and don't have to feel like you've disappointed them every time they're around. \n\nAlso, it's not an AH move to ask someone to not do something in a situation like this. However, if she says no, then you have to accept it and move on. And who knows, your parents might *actually* like it. My own super strict mother has surprised me with a dick joke on more than one occasion.", "Gonna go with NTA here, since your request was based on your parents personalities.\n\nI think in these situations everyone wants their parents not to be \"annoyed\" by their SO. I can see this coming from a place of care and wanting to spare your girlfriend the awkwardness of dealing with your parents reaction.", "NTA. She\u2019s the host and should accommodate her guests\u2019 preferences as much as possible. It\u2019s not a big deal for her to stop for a couple nights, especially when it\u2019s their first meeting.", "NTA - it's a reasonable ask; you don't seem to have phrased it as a demand but rather a polite request.", "NTA. Her reaction was disproportionate to what you were asking. I\u2019m annoyed on your behalf, thinking about the same lame joke every single night. I appreciate you haven\u2019t said anything previously to humour her.", "NTA. \n\nYou, understandably, want your parents to like your girlfriend.

If your parents are so uptight that a mild joke before dinner is going to \u201cannoy\u201d them, then the problem is your miserable, unpleasant parents, not your GF.  You\u2019d have been much better off being vulnerable. For example, \u201cGF. My parents are miserable and humorless people. Meeting them stresses me out so much.

Can you hold off for me?\u201d", "INFO: Have you considered just warning your parents about the dinner and a joke thing?\n\nLike, I gather from your comments that you don't interact with them much but maybe you should just call and explain so they have a heads up.", "Nta.  This is an overreaction.  You two should have been able to have a conversation about it.", "NTA - I think that, as hard as it can be to hear, part of being in a good partnership is having someone who will be honest and do what they can to protect you from embarrassing yourself. It seems like you saw a problem coming and tried to head it off at the pass. Her response was way too dramatic for what happened. I get her being hurt, but leaving for two days is a bit much.", "Look, your parents don't sound like winners here, but I also think the request to pause the jokes for a weekend is something a reasonable partner would try to accommodate.

If so, would you expect her to never do dinner and a joke around your family, ever?", "NTA. I think this is more nuanced than people care to give attention to. The way I see it, you have been letting her do this as it honors and reminds her of her dad. Your parents might find it ok once, but if she serves dinner like that each time, they may find it strange, and you're putting that squarely in their court, telling your girlfriend her parents are uptight. \n\nWe can imagine other quirks or habits, like someone always serving ice cream after dinner (parents are health nuts) someone who plays loud music (parents like the quiet) someone who has a lot of offbeat art (parents are prudes), that may elicit a similar request to OP's. I think it's a reality that in most relationships, people are just trying to keep the peace with their parents, and certainly to not give them any fodder to judge their partners. Yes, we should love our partners for who they are and not be ashamed of them, but there's a difference between hiding a partner's occupation, religion, sexual orientation, etc, and dinner and a joke.", "NTA. \n\nAnd it's not your typing that's whack.

Though it would be good for her to seek counseling it's not always practical and her process is mimimumly invasive.", "This is a very important piece to the story. It connects her to her dead father. I lost my dad at 21. I\u2019ve now lived more than half my life without him. OP is fortunate to not understand the impact that had on her. We tend to think of big things when someone goes through a loss. Deceased\u2019s birthday, anniversary of death, holidays and special events they are no longer there for. But it is also the small things. She had dinner and a joke with him, and carried it on when he was gone, and OP wants her to cut off a tradition that helps her feel connected to her dad. My dad taught me bird watching. My kids may get tired of hearing about birds when we\u2019re outside (they\u2019re sweet enough to not tell me I\u2019m boring them so I don\u2019t know for sure), but it keeps him here close to me. This isn\u2019t him asking her to not tell a goofy joke to her, this is him asking her to cut off an important connection. This would be no different than asking a person to not put their dead grandmother\u2019s ornament on the Christmas tree for aesthetic value, or to take down a treasured Precious Moments figurine from a dead aunt because it\u2019s tacky, etc. She wasn\u2019t raised with the parent pleasing attitude he has, so she doesn\u2019t see that side of it, either. I\u2019m going with NAH, but they need better communication.", "Not only that but she\u2019s been asked not to do it for the sake of OP\u2019s parents. Kind of rubbing her face in the loss.", "But for two whole days? Seems a little over the top, perhaps?", "It is an overreaction nevertheless.\n\nMost people lose their parents at some point of their lives, yet it does not give them a right to be jerks to other people.\n\nA mature reaction in this case would be to discuss it with tne BF to express my feelings and let him express his.\n\nAn understandable reaction would be to pout for 30 minutes and then have the above discussion.\n\nTo disappear for 2 days without a word is a HUGE red flag. She is unable to control her emotions and does not/is unable to care for the effect it causes. It may not be her fault but must be extremely difficult to live with.\n\nAs to the OP - I see a red flag too. He anticipates his parents won't like the joke, without really knowing if they will or not, and is bending over backwards to satisfy their (perhaps imaginary) wish. The habit is getting on HIS OWN nerves, which is very legitimate, but it seems to me he is hiding behind his parents' back.\n\nI would say ESH in this situation. Her for overreacting, him for being hypocritical.\n\nAnd I don't think it is a good idea to have the first meeting with the parents (let alone strict and critical ones) having them stay in your home for a week.", "Oh no they do, they do. Please don't leave me for 2 days.", "asking you to not do those jokes for 1 week is not \"criticism\" nor is it being fake.\n\nImagine your partner burps without covering his mouth and it actually is not too much of a problem for you. I mean, it's just a burp. But then you know your parents come to visit for the very first time and you ask your partner \"hey honey, can you maybe try to not burp, or cover your mouth, for this one weekend?\". Is that being fake? It honestly didn't bother you, but you know it'll bother your parents. \n\nIf your partner cant do that for you, and leaves for 2 days based on that request then it's not on you but on them. That's just plain weird behavior.", "If you are never going to measure up why bother? It sounds like you have chosen a partner who is the opposite of your parents. This is probably for a reason. Which one do you enjoy spending time with, which one makes you happy. It\u2019s probably not your parents. I\u2019d say let your girlfriend be 100% who she is, joke and all. Your parents could probably do with a few jokes in their lives.  You live on the other side of the country, if you\u2019re going to be a disappointment anyway you may as well be a happy disappointment.\n\nI would however, talk to your girlfriend about forcing you to tell a joke when you make dinner. It\u2019s not fair to force others to tell jokes on demand if they don\u2019t want to.", "I don't know, you hurt your gf over something that is a tiny thing in the grand scheme of things, just to score some points in an already lost game. You gotta ask yourself if it's worth it. It reminds her of her late father and you asked her to stop because it's embarrassing for you in front of your parents. How will she ever feel comfortable doing this little endearing gesture again, knowing you find it weird enough to make her hide it? I don't think you are TA, but I think your priorities are out of whack. You should apologise to her sincerely and stop trying to impress your parents. If they don't like your girlfriend for a harmless joke, their approval is worth nothing anyway.", "If someone has said this, and has this continued attitude, and you constantly try to impress them it's happening at someone expense. If its yours, that's still wrong but it's self inflicted. If it's your partner your forcing your insecurities and childhood traumas onto her.\n\nYou're never gonna win with these people. And if you do, why should it be on their terms and not a joint effort? \n\nFocus on your girl!", "Well, if your parents ever criticize her occupation, I hope she makes her joke of the night the old maxim, pretending to sadly agree with them. \u201cYou\u2019re right- after all, as Dorothy Parker said, you can lead a horticulture, but you can\u2019t make her think.\u201d", "They really said that to you? That's terrible. They're comparing your partners and saying she's not as good? You both deserve better than this. Parents can really knock your sense of self esteem with their disapproval and unrealistic expectations. I hope you can untangle yourself from it and see that you are both enough as you are. \n\nRegarding the main question, I think your girlfriend shouldn't have to modify her personality to fit in with disapproving parents. It may be uncomfortable, but that's it's equally down to your parents. I'm sure you are used to modifying your own behaviour to suit them, but that's unhealthy and prevents you from truly being yourself - which you deserve to be.\n\nI don't know you and may be off the mark, but giving this angle in case it does fit. It is a very common issue than many face.", "See this is the thing though... Everyone voting N T A and saying *she'd only have to change for one night it's not that hard of an ask*  doesn't understand that it's not only for one night, or the weekend. \nIt's for good, until you set some boundaries with your parents and take control of your life.\n\nYou said it yourself, she will likely never be good enough for them... That's not her problem, it's theirs.\n\nIs this what you want for your life? Constantly scared of their reactions to benign, normal things and asking your gf to change in order to please The Unpleasables everytime they come in to town? It's an exercise in futility.\n\nRight now it's only \"don't do your dinner & a joke\" but what's next? I had parents like this too and I can almost guarantee you it doesn't matter how perfect she is or you are, they will find something to dislike, they will find a reason to cut you down. Are you going to be on their side, or on hers?\n\nEdit to add words", "Because that's not disconcerting at all....", "I didn't take that part as he's literally guessing, more of a figure of speech. He did say it was her late father, though. It is quite a bit of inferring past that. She had a very emotional reaction to being asked to stop this little nightly tradition and the only context given was that it was from her dead dad... it's just a shot at what she was feeling towards it.", "From the point of seriousness then - have you thought about any future events that may happen between your partner and parents? \nIf you have a child and your wife's views on parenting will be different from those of your parents, which side will you choose? Will you stand by her if there is any conflict? \nIt would be a major red flag for me and a moment to reconsider this relationship - you don't seem loyal to your gf in small things, so why would you be in serious situations? \nThere's a massive difference between asking someone for emotional support in a situation like this - I'm afraid of my parents, help me cope - and asking them to act like they were someone else. \nI get it - my own mother was this kind of person - thinking that her own education and job choices made her so important and superior. It's hard and kills your self-confidence. It also kills relationships. \nYou have to decide if you are happy with your life choices, your career, and your partner. If those are what you want, stop pretending that you are someone else. If not, don't waste your and your gf's time, split and start anew.", "Yes, and he's doing the same sort of thing as with his parents: \"I don't like this, so I'll just grit my teeth and put up with it so that things go smoothly.\"", "This is how I feel too and why he\u2019s TA to me. He doesn\u2019t like something small that brings her joy.

They shake their heads and cannot understand why he won\u2019t follow their sage advice.", "Wow pretty much your parents are snobby a-holes huh?", "I think the hurt feelings are probably less about the joke and more about the implication: \u201cI\u2019m worried my parents won\u2019t like/approve of you so can you please tone your personality down?\u201d", "Then he should break up with her. Instead he's desperately trying to gain the approval of parents who will never give it.", "this is the gf and the parents, first meeting. i understand if he would want her to pause it for a day or two, so that they're more receptive later on.  i also agree with you he needs to stand up to his parents. he's gone to therapy for how he was treated, i think the parents should also consider how they treat others for once (which can be impossible but this is mostly for op to read)", "He asked her if she could not do it for one weekend. He didn\u2019t demand that she do it. He didn\u2019t forbid her or anything like that. Jesus Christ what is with this sub and taking everything to the extreme.", "so the boyfriend's wishes don't matter one bit? Why is it that when a woman doesn't want the husband to do something he's the asshole if he keeps doing it, but when the roles are reversed \"she's just being herself\"? \n\nNot making a \"diner and a joke\" is not \"not being herself\" wtf. Is your entire personality built on one dinner ritual? That'd be very sad.\n\nObviously if the father died like 3 months ago i'd understand it, but i assume OP would have mentioned that if it was not long ago. But if it is something that's happened 10 years ago then by this point she should be able to not do this ritual once when asked. If you can't do such a simple thing for one weekend for your partner and need to throw a tantrum and leave for 2 days for something as ridiculous than this then you're first of all not well adjusted and have no clue about compromise in relationships.", "Well, when you are in a relationship and meeting for parents for first time, I don't know how you were educated but I was told to be to my best behaviour, nice and polite. If she is having a 2 days tantrum because she can't do a silly ritual for , \u00f4 horror, 2 days, she must go to therapy as well. This is not even changing herself, just make a tiny effort. \nCan we stop cuddling childish behaviours in grown-ass adults?", "Oh. Good take. If her childishness was maybe what attracted him to her in the first place?\n\nBut now it's growing old, and he's getting tired of it and her jokes.

It\u2019s one of those things you can do with a child. The gf is stuck in some kind of past grief.", "Yeah, this. Also, why are we putting all the focus on the parents' comfort? The gf has always done this little thing, it means something to her in memory of her dead father according to OP, now she's supposed to hide it because his parents have a stick up their arse? What about her feelings and comfort? How is she supposed to ever feel comfortable again with her jokes after OP basically said it's so embarrassing his parents shouldn't witness it? I think it's borderline heartbreaking. A knock knock joke takes 15 seconds, it was important to her and completely harmless to anyone else. \n\nAnd I bet if the gf suddenly stopped doing her jokes without warning, OP would think something is off.", "I was a nurse in a hospital and one of the former CEOs had a military background, very stern looking. I had heard through the grapevine he always had a joke of the day, and he will tell the joke if you ask him. One morning I stopped him at the nurse's station and said, 'Mr. S what is the joke of the day?' The other nurses thought I was possessed! The CEO was surprised but he told a joke and from then on, I seen him as more human.  I think the dinner and a joke is cute. It's part of her personality and maybe he needs to lighten up a little. It's harmless. It's not like she is doing a strip tease while she's serving dinner. If his parents are that serious about everything, they will just find something else they don't like about the girlfriend.", "He could simply share \"I don't think my parents will be into the joke thing.\" But, instead, he is trying to prescribe her actions, rather than give her information and let her decide whether or not to do it.", "100 percent agree with you. The parents are coming to visit him and his girlfriend in their home. Their home their rules. If he was going to visit them I might understand being a bit more careful but like you said the issue is the relationship with OP's parents.

Will he continue to walk on eggs like a 12 year old.", "Im going YTA as well, ur a grown ass adult and u think u need to fulfill ur parents every whim when they visit ur home? I understand making them comfortable but it wouldnt hurt a soul to hear a joke even if it sucks, and honestly him saying what he did about not liking her jokes behind her back here on reddit instead of to her face is YTA also. Practice communication, quit living like a little boy hiding and wanting everyone's approval. Im gonna say his parents musta done a pretty good number on him for him to be so bent on keeping everyone happy, poor guy must be like walking on a tightrope.", "Good for you!! I hope OP\u2019s girlfriend handles it the same way. \n\nHow did it go when you finally met them?", "*keep going to therapy", "She can't be that confident if she ran away at the first suggestion of not doing the joke. Even he's getting tired of it- how's she going to react when she finds out he's not into it either? \n\nShe's imposing this ritual on the other people in her life every single day without considering whether or not they want to be included in it. She's even willing to impose it on total strangers. \n\nOPs issues with his parents aside, she sounds like she lacks self awareness. She needs to save this bit for special occasions or for her own kids.", "HA that joke has been rolled out with dinner and joke, shortly after she started at the garden center hahahaha", "Bedside manner is lacking in most surgeons tbh", "tbf the pun at dinner thing was connected to her being very very upset and staying with her mother, it's more than just the puns for the gf", "If a single joke at dinner is making them start to get annoyed I am gonna question his overall personality. Even if I don't like most of the jokes, I wouldn't get annoyed. It's a minute of time before dinner.", "Honestly to me it\u2019s  just rude to take up space in a small apartment if you don\u2019t have to. My folks were incredible parents, and also understood the value of not staying in my small living spaces.

In this case, your potential future in-laws don't.", "So, for most posts, here it's \"everyone can benefit from therapy\" and all advice always being **therapy, therapy, therapy** but now it's \"if OP needs therapy because of the way he was raised they must be abusive\"?", "Or the gf just wants to do something that helps connect her to her parent who\u2019s passed, and it makes her happy. It\u2019s a cheesy joke, not some senseless or mean prank or anything like that. Nothing wrong with maintaining a connection with those you love who have passed, especially when what you\u2019re doing is harmless.", "Just because something is meaningful to them doesn't mean they are stuck in their past grief. It's not like she's reciting a long prayer. She is keeping her dad alive in one way that she knows how. Plus even if it is grief it's not stated how long her father has been gone. This might just be a way to lessen pain as I knew elderly people who was still hurting from their parents death.", "Then simply put OP should grow a backbone and discuss it with her, but be prepared to accept she may not be willing to change it as it seems to be part of her way to remember her dead father.\n\nGrief is complicated and can affect everyone differently. I still carry grief for my mother I lost many years ago. She should seek support councilling (there are many groups for grief both online and in person) but her tradition is small and not terribly invasive.", "I believe you [op] are setting yourself up to be let down in this situation. They already have a bad attitude, so whether your girlfriend makes a joke or not, things won't go well.", "The problem is that she too reacted inappropriately by disappearing for two days, but as I recently lost my Da, I can see why it upset her.", "He asked her not to do it for one night. Asked, not demanded. How does that make him an asshole?", "NTA. I believe that there are more nuances to this than people care to consider. I think you've been letting her do this because it honours and brings back memories for her of her father.", "Exactly, inform her of the parents attitude and let her decide how to proceed. Parents be really messing they kids up so bad that they think they have to always meet some standard. Screw them \"serious\" parents who never took the time to tell him its ok to be different and have fun, or that its ok to support someone even if they like something different than u such as the GFs jokes.", "We don't get a choice about whether or not we care.  We do get to choose what we do in response to those feelings.  We get to decide whether acting on those feelings comes at too high a cost.", "Agreed. This is not a lesson you learn in one year.

All of their disappointments are their problem, not yours. If YOU are happy with your home your job your life and your spouse then that has to be enough.

Maybe they aren\u2019t the most amiable persons on earth, I get it, but it's just for one evening.\n\nIt's a matter of reading the room.", "also the overreacting by the girlfriend is a red flag.

Compromising on things that don't usually happen is one thing. Compromising on something that bothers you on a daily basis is a recipe for disaster.  \n\n\nBut the fact that she took such offense and had such a strong reaction to such a logical petition makes her NOT long term relationship material, much less marriage material.

If she doesn't, then a I'm really torn between a gentle Y T A and E S H. You for not explaining why, her for not hearing you out and asking why. I strongly feel that you should sit down and discuss this in depth. You have very valid reasons for asking her to temporarily drop this. This isn't a situation where you're ashamed of her, it's coming from a place of concern and wanting to protect her from how harsh your parents can be. If it's a risk she's willing to take, I know it's hard, but I recommend siding with your girlfriend when she makes a joke. Even if her jokes are wearing thin, laugh and encourage her if she does it in front of your parents, and proceed to tell her you love her. And honestly, if she isn't willing to do this for you, maybe take a look at the give and take of the relationship. It could be that this is a one off, but I like to think that a serious partner would feel just as protective of you and be willing to cut out this part of her routine for one weekend to make your life easier. I get that it's how she feels close to her dad, but maybe she could say it to you privately in the kitchen before dinner, or privately after dinner. The whole thing just seems odd to me, so my verdict depends entirely on the level of communication that was involved here.\n\nI know it's tough. My parents are similar. I introduced them to my boyfriend a few weeks ago, and I was panicking hard, let him know that they might be jerks but that I love him regardless, and asked if he'd be comfortable behaving in a very specific way and dressing a little different. Fortunately, he was happy to comply for the sake of my sanity, whipped out the most pleasant customer service personality, and willingly had a lengthy \"conversation\" with my mom's dog while holding her before any handshakes without any promoting *cough cough.* He also whipped out the biggest, fanciest words I've ever heard, touted his schooling and worldly knowledge, dropped his travel experience into conversation while making it sound super fancy, and basically just dropped all his stats. Miracle of miracles, my parents love my dorky, couch potato-y book nerd... Without him behaving this way, they'd never have given him enough of a chance to see that he's one of the kindest, gentlest, most hardworking and just generally adorable and loveable people I've ever met.

If you ask her to stop for this visit, would you expect her to stop for future visits? What if you decide to get married and have kids, which may cause longer and more frequent visits?
