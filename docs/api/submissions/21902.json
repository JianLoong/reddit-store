I also disagree with everyone saying Y T A because you're \"asking her to change\"\n\nSome people don't know what it's like to grow up with strict parents. If they don't like something, then that thing never, EVER gets to happen again. The disapproval from serious and strict parents is crushing, and it cuts deep, even as an adult. \n\nIt's a form of protection, to adapt something or someone you love to them, so they approve of the person you love and don't have to feel like you've disappointed them every time they're around. \n\nAlso, it's not an AH move to ask someone to not do something in a situation like this. However, if she says no, then you have to accept it and move on. And who knows, your parents might *actually* like it. My own super strict mother has surprised me with a dick joke on more than one occasion.", "Gonna go with NTA here, since your request was based on your parents personalities.\n\nI think in these situations everyone wants their parents not to be \"annoyed\" by their SO. I can see this coming from a place of care and wanting to spare your girlfriend the awkwardness of dealing with your parents reaction.", "NTA. She\u2019s the host and should accommodate her guests\u2019 preferences as much as possible. It\u2019s not a big deal for her to stop for a couple nights, especially when it\u2019s their first meeting.", "NTA - it's a reasonable ask; you don't seem to have phrased it as a demand but rather a polite request.", "NTA. Her reaction was disproportionate to what you were asking. I\u2019m annoyed on your behalf, thinking about the same lame joke every single night. I appreciate you haven\u2019t said anything previously to humour her.", "NTA. \n\nYou, understandably, want your parents to like your girlfriend.

If your parents are so uptight that a mild joke before dinner is going to \u201cannoy\u201d them, then the problem is your miserable, unpleasant parents, not your GF.  You\u2019d have been much better off being vulnerable. For example, \u201cGF. My parents are miserable and humorless people. Meeting them stresses me out so much.

Can you hold off for me?\u201d", "INFO: Have you considered just warning your parents about the dinner and a joke thing?\n\nLike, I gather from your comments that you don't interact with them much but maybe you should just call and explain so they have a heads up.", "Nta.  This is an overreaction.  You two should have been able to have a conversation about it.", "NTA - I think that, as hard as it can be to hear, part of being in a good partnership is having someone who will be honest and do what they can to protect you from embarrassing yourself. It seems like you saw a problem coming and tried to head it off at the pass. Her response was way too dramatic for what happened. I get her being hurt, but leaving for two days is a bit much.", "Look, your parents don't sound like winners here, but I also think the request to pause the jokes for a weekend is something a reasonable partner would try to accommodate. Not everything needs to be a hill to die on. Unless you've left something out of the story, storming out of the house for 2 days is a wild overreaction.

If so, would you expect her to never do dinner and a joke around your family, ever?", "NTA. I think this is more nuanced than people care to give attention to. The way I see it, you have been letting her do this as it honors and reminds her of her dad. Your parents might find it ok once, but if she serves dinner like that each time, they may find it strange, and you're putting that squarely in their court, telling your girlfriend her parents are uptight. \n\nWe can imagine other quirks or habits, like someone always serving ice cream after dinner (parents are health nuts) someone who plays loud music (parents like the quiet) someone who has a lot of offbeat art (parents are prudes), that may elicit a similar request to OP's. I think it's a reality that in most relationships, people are just trying to keep the peace with their parents, and certainly to not give them any fodder to judge their partners. Yes, we should love our partners for who they are and not be ashamed of them, but there's a difference between hiding a partner's occupation, religion, sexual orientation, etc, and dinner and a joke.", "NTA. \n\nAnd it's not your typing that's whack.

Her getting upset is reasonable but leaving home for 2 days sounds ridiculous to me", "They\u2019re not from the U.S. no, good spidey senses. My mom is from Syria of mixed middle eastern heritage and my Dad is Pakistani.", "She is definitely hypersensitive right now but it\u2019s unrelated to any of this, I honestly shouldn\u2019t have included that in the post because there\u2019s other work/manager drama in her life right now making her extra sensitive to criticism", "He doesn't have to not love them, but they deserve way less catering to and toleration of their unreasonable attitudes.", "INB4 this sub accuses them of abuse because they don't like a joke", "He doesn't need to cut them out of his life, just stop respecting and catering to their ridiculous expectations and attitudes. If they storm out, it's totally on them.\n\nIt's not possible for someone to be \"humorless and whip-strict\" and not be an AH.", "My SO got all antsy, grumpy, and stressed before taking me to meet the parents. He was getting short with me and putting a lot of needless pressure on me to impress them. I told him I changed my mind and don\u2019t want to meet them. I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m not meeting them without his support and without him in my corner. He got it together pretty quick.", "Ok, but guess whose fault that is? It's your parents' fault. No amount of putting that on yourself or your girlfriend is going to change anything, that's just being mean to yourself and understandably your gf wants no part of that. You keep changing one thing, then one more thing, then one more thing to make them tolerate you, but you really want to rope your gf into that nonsense too? Go to therapy", "Seriously why are you putting either of you through this then? You say you want this to go well but you already know that it won't. So don't do it. I don't invite judgy assholes into my house. why do you?", "She sounds funny and confident and you telling her she cannot be herself can shatter her confidence. Don\u2019t do to her what your parents did to you.", "Lovely you're an adult. You know you can tell them to go fuck themselves, right? Please continue with therapy. Therapy = good\nGirlfriend = good\nParents = bad\nPlease be open about your trauma with your girlfriend. She sounds lovely and a good partner. Please don't alienate her making her feel like your parents would. \nPlease don't do this to yourself.", "Honestly, this sounds like the perfect green light to be completely yourself, and encourage your GF to do the same. Those kind of people will never be happy with what you do, might as well let her light shine.", "I also see this as you trying to spare her feelings. She probably doesn't think it will go as bad as you are saying. If this is how she reacts to you politely asking her not to do that while your parents are around, she is going to be devastated by their reaction to her dinner and a joke. You sound like it want it to go well, to prove them wrong, while also protecting her feelings in the process. NTA btw. I'm not impressed by her reaction either honestly. You two need to really sit down and talk this out.", "Tell \u2018em to fuck off when they say pretentious, elitist, classist shit like that. \n\nThey sound exhausting.", "Your parents are straight up nasty.  Don't join in their games.", "WOW that\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m sorry OP :(", "Given that sentiment, I would support my SO through what is likely to be a very trying visit, as she is hopefully the person you plan to continue living with and making a life of your own with.", "Your life will be so so much better when you start living it for yourself and stop living it for them. You will never be good enough because they won't let you be so live your life the way you want.", "The why not would be upsetting your significant other I guess? Either way I said NAH.", "OP is asking his gf to hide something really important to her because of her dead father in order to appease his uptight alive parents.\n\nIt sounds like it is REALLY important to her because of her father, not because she is obsessed with cheesy jokes.", "No never! Because then you\u2019re a soulless uncaring person who\u2019s maybe a narc and absent in your partners life!/s \n\nI love my partners quirks. It\u2019s what attracted me to him ngl. But I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say some times the random noises can overstimulate me", "Someone above thinks good relationships are built on honesty and he should sit her down and tell her the joke thing is lame and he doesn\u2019t enjoy it. That\u2019ll be a relationship that goes places. People are clueless sometimes.", "How are they on music?", "Ok see that's good info to have, it might be too late to stick that in there but I feel it would dispel some questions, like I had. Maybe she didn't like the tone? \n\nI still say NAH, but I hope the visit goes smoothly for you!", "I tried this for 40 years with my mother. She was insufferable and hated every single decision I ever made as an adult. I finally gave up and went very LC until she died.", "If you've been through this, then you should understand that it's almost never as easy as \"just stop caring\". If it was for you, then great, but it's obviously not for him.", "Because learning to not try to get the approval of permanently disapproving parents is a long and hard road. From OP's comments, he's already in therapy for this, which is an important step, but something like this is deeply ingrained. You can't just stop.", "To be honest I don\u2019t know how to formulate an answer that isn\u2019t going to sound stupid because it\u2019s a pretty complex answer. What I KNOW my family to be like and what I WANT to happen and what I want the future with me family to look like don\u2019t completely overlap, but there\u2019s some grey area. I love my parents. It\u2019s a hard thing. I haven\u2019t seen them in 3 years and they want to come see the place and meet the girlfriend.", "She prolly usually associated with normal kind people so why would she expect it to go badly?", "Its abuse if you don't let your partner do what they want!!!!", "I'm probably the more annoying one in my relationship. I'm \"weird\" and \"fun\", but I think I may be \"tiring\". I see quite a bit of myself in my oldest son, and yeah he is so damn weird. My husband swears he wasn't weird until he met us. . .I  honestly don't remember if he was \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nJust like reddit thinks pretty much any negative emotion/words towards one's child is abusive. Also, don't forget that man are always controlling and abusive! Everyone is a narcissist who gaslights!", "I mean at some point I would tell my husband to tone it down, but my husband and I do roll our eyes at one another and intentionally tell cheesy/bad jokes. \n\nPeople on this sub seem to oscillate between being honest to a fault and thinking that saying anything even remotely hurtful (no matter how true) is tantamount to emotional abuse. . .", "They only really listen to classical music, why do you ask?", "Right?!? GF might as well be herself since they\u2019re probably not gonna like her anyways. They sound horrible and if I were OP I would just live my life however I want. They can take their opinions and negativity back to their rotten egg life back east", "No but this could be the first time he's heard it and it might not be an option he's thought of. It's a start", "It doesn\u2019t matter regardless. OP has already stated him and his gf are seen as \u201closers\u201d in his parents eyes with their low ranking jobs. Joke or not won\u2019t make a difference in their eyes. I doubt they\u2019d even remember as they don\u2019t even rank. The only person who\u2019d get upset is OP who still wants to please his parents.\n\nI\u2019d let her be herself. Her real personality has to come out anyway and you never know."]}
