We live on the west coast US and my parents are on the east coast. They\u2019re coming to stay with us for the weekend in about 3 weeks here. We are getting the place settled and tidy and prepping for them to come. This will be their first meeting.\n\nMy girlfriend does this thing every night where when she serves dinner, she tells some sort of little pun or knock knock joke, and then says \u201cDinner and a joke!\u201d And then we eat. She does it for every meal she makes, even the meals I make she will say \u201cok, do your dinner and a joke!\u201d \n\nI guess it\u2019s something her late Dad did and she really enjoys it. To be quite frank, I\u2019m a little tired of it, but I know it makes her happy and it\u2019s important to her so I smile and play along, and I never say anything about it getting old. \n\nI asked her the other night if we could pause \u201cdinner and a joke\u201d when my parents visit. My mom isn\u2019t particularly humorous (PhD chemist and medical doctor) and my dad also takes himself extremely (surgeon), very very very serious people. Not that all medical doctors are overly serious, but my parents are. Very critical people in general. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to enjoy it, I think it will annoy them.\n\nI asked her to stop just for the weekend and we can go back to it. She got extremely upset and said that I was being a total asshole and stayed with her mom for an entire 2 days about the whole thing. \n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit; edited for some typos and grammar, my typing is just whack today apparently!", "created_utc": 1689042250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14we3tf/aita_28m_for_asking_my_girlfriend_27m_not_to_do/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. \n\nI don't think you're TA for wanting your parents to like your girlfriend. I also disagree with everyone saying YTA because you're \"asking her to change\"\n\nSome people don't know what it's like to grow up with strict parents. If they don't like something, then that thing never, EVER gets to happen again. The disapproval from serious and strict parents is crushing, and it cuts deep, even as an adult. \n\nIt's a form of protection, to adapt something or someone you love to them, so they approve of the person you love and don't have to feel like you've disappointed them every time they're around. \n\nAlso, it's not an AH move to ask someone to not do something in a situation like this. However, if she says no, then you have to accept it and move on. And who knows, your parents might *actually* like it. My own super strict mother has surprised me with a dick joke on more than one occasion.", "Gonna go with NTA here, since your request was based on your parents personalities.\n\nI think in these situations everyone wants their parents not to be \"annoyed\" by their SO. I can see this coming from a place of care and wanting to spare your girlfriend the awkwardness of dealing with your parents reaction.", "NTA. She\u2019s the host and should accommodate her guests\u2019 preferences as much as possible. It\u2019s not a big deal for her to stop for a couple nights, especially when it\u2019s their first meeting.", "NTA - it's a reasonable ask; you don't seem to have phrased it as a demand but rather a polite request.", "NTA. Her reaction was disproportionate to what you were asking. I\u2019m annoyed on your behalf, thinking about the same lame joke every single night. I appreciate you haven\u2019t said anything previously to humour her.", "NTA. \n\nYou, understandably, want your parents to like your girlfriend.  You know them and believe they wouldn't receive this well.  Seems pretty reasonable to me.", "Totally see how that would get old, and how that would be excruciating if the jokes are ever offensive. But after having kids, that could be really cute. \n\nNTAH", "Gentle YTA. If your parents are so uptight that a mild joke before dinner is going to \u201cannoy\u201d them, then the problem is your miserable, unpleasant parents, not your GF.  You\u2019d have been much better off being vulnerable. For example, \u201cGF. My parents are miserable and humorless people. Meeting them stresses me out so much. I\u2019m so worried this dinner is going to be even worse if you even tell your mild joke. Can you hold off for me?\u201d", "INFO: Have you considered just warning your parents about the dinner and a joke thing?\n\nLike, I gather from your comments that you don't interact with them much but maybe you should just call and explain so they have a heads up.", "Nta.  This is an overreaction.  You two should have been able to have a conversation about it.", "NTA - I think that, as hard as it can be to hear, part of being in a good partnership is having someone who will be honest and do what they can to protect you from embarrassing yourself. It seems like you saw a problem coming and tried to head it off at the pass. Her response was way too dramatic for what happened. I get her being hurt, but leaving for two days is a bit much.", "Look, your parents don't sound like winners here, but I also think the request to pause the jokes for a weekend is something a reasonable partner would try to accommodate. Not everything needs to be a hill to die on. Unless you've left something out of the story, storming out of the house for 2 days is a wild overreaction. I'm going with NTA", "Yeah, YTA. \n\nEither you find her charming and interesting or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not fair to ask her to be different in order to impress your parents.", "YTA\n\n> it\u2019s something her late Dad did and **she really enjoys it**.\n\n>  **I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to enjoy it**, I think it will annoy them.\n\nYou should care **_more_** about your partner's enjoyment than your parents'.", "NTA You're allowed to ask. but she has trauma she's not over yet and this will continue to be a difficult subject until she moves through that trauma.", "Do you see yourself ever marrying your girlfriend? If so, would you expect her to never do dinner and a joke around your family, ever?", "NTA. I think this is more nuanced than people care to give attention to. The way I see it, you have been letting her do this as it honors and reminds her of her dad. Your parents might find it ok once, but if she serves dinner like that each time, they may find it strange, and you're putting that squarely in their court, telling your girlfriend her parents are uptight. \n\nWe can imagine other quirks or habits, like someone always serving ice cream after dinner (parents are health nuts) someone who plays loud music (parents like the quiet) someone who has a lot of offbeat art (parents are prudes), that may elicit a similar request to OP's. I think it's a reality that in most relationships, people are just trying to keep the peace with their parents, and certainly to not give them any fodder to judge their partners. Yes, we should love our partners for who they are and not be ashamed of them, but there's a difference between hiding a partner's occupation, religion, sexual orientation, etc, and dinner and a joke.", "NTA. \n\nAnd it's not your typing that's whack. Your childish GF can't stop doing something annoying for ONE night for you. How selfish is she?  And then gets upset and leaves for 2 days - over this?\n\nDude, she's got issues and that response is not normal.", "YTA. You're almost 30, time to feel confident in your choice of a partner and not manage mommy and daddy's feelings or prioritize them over your partner.", "YATA \n\nSo your gf has an interesting quirk, and your parents sound like unfunny people, that\u2019s not her fault nor is it her problem. Doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be herself in her own home. If your parents don\u2019t like it, oh well, life goes on", "YTA, you said it\u2019s a small pun or a knock knock joke, it sounds pretty innocuous, not a stand up comedy skit or something elaborate.

It\u2019s one thing if your gf had done it in front of your parents and they were annoyed that you don\u2019t want her doing it again, but she hasn\u2019t done it before and your parents haven\u2019t reacted, how would you know?", "YTA\nYou're 28 years old. You don't need to tiptoe around mommy and daddy's every opinion at this point. \nYour gf has a harmless quirky habit. She is in her own home, making a quick inoffensive joke. She should have the freedom to do that. \nYou can acknowledge that your parents have no sense of humor so as to give her a heads up that no one is going to laugh. \nBut you're treating it as though she's the problem, and she's not. You're the problem because heaven forbid your gf not come across as absolutely perfect to your parents. \nWill she have to turn her personality off every single time they come around?", "[deleted]", "YTA for not letting her know before that you\u2019re a little tired of it.", "YTA.

You don't want to get you or your girlfriend hurt by your strict parents. If they are as tough and strict as you make them see, they will never approve of anything you do. You could be freaggin superman and it wouldn't be enough. This is clearly an issue for you and it might even have left you some PTSD. Talk to your girlfriend, tell her what you told us and how it emotionally hurts you and makes you feel like you're not good enough and you don't want her to feel that way. The best way to solve an issue is talking about it. I think if you are honest with her she'll understand. It's for your own mental health, it's not just because you don't like it. I hope you two can sort this out.", "NTA  It sounds like your GF has a lot of growing up to do as a 27 year old. Just because she likes something not everyone else is going to. You know your parents better than she does so you'd think she'd want to make a good impression instead she's throwing a fit like a child and running off to mommy when she doesn't get her way. Your future looks awfully bleak.", "NTA. She has agreed to host your parents. A host needs to prioritize their guest's comfort. You are letting her know well in advance this bit would make your parents uncomfortable. She's overreacting. Does she want to start off on the wrong foot with your parents, who might presumably be in her life for the very long term? It's a weird hill to die on. I'd talk to her about it once she calms down.", "INFO: did you explain why?", "Could you warn your parents? So they're prepared, and can be polite? And if they can't be polite, that's on them, not on your girlfriend.\n\nBTW, if you're tired of her jokes before dinner, start cracking some of your own. I bet she'd be delighted, and you'd have more fun.", "YTA, it's this one request now, but I feel like it sets the precedent to ask her to change other things about her that your parents may not approve of and that just sounds like a recipe for disaster", "YTA because your girlfriend shouldn't have to change her behavior for your parents especially when it's something as innocent as a knock knock joke. If she has to change how she acts let her stay elsewhere while your parents visit or you go visit them instead", "NAH. OP isn\u2019t asking her to stop the behaviour forever, but is more or less trying to protect her from the emotional pain of having a harsh response from their parents. \n\nOP knows his parents better than anyone, and although it is possible they may like the joke, it is equally possible that they won\u2019t- and why make the first meeting of the parents more awkward. \n\nAlthough if the GF chooses to do this, I would recommend explaining the back story as to why it is important to her. Or OP could give his parents a heads up before they arrive so they are prepared.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve been in therapy for over a year now because of how much growing up with 2 humorless and whip-strict doctors affected me. It\u2019s really difficult NOT to go into full blown \u201ceverything MUST be how they like it\u201d mode.", "It's not like he's asked her to change her looks or her personality or anything else. Just don't tell a joke for ONE night. It's pretty strange that she can't do this little thing for him, IMO.", "> It's a form of protection\n\nThe **correct** way to \"protect\" in this case would be to *not invite disapproving guests over in the first place*.\n\nNo one needs that energy in their lives.", "I desperately want them to like her.

I see us married and continuing our habit of infrequent interaction with my parents, hopefully\u2026", "It\u2019s mommy AND daddy thank you very much", "They\u2019re entirely unfunny people, hence the request.

They are already on a negative streak, no matter if your gf does a joke or not...it isn't going to go smooth. \n\nIt takes a lot to stop chasing approval from hard to please parents.

Stop exhausting yourself seeking their approval and live your life!! Sounds like you have a great girlfriend.", "Like I said, I think what your delivery was missing was vulnerability. Instead of conveying, \u201cMy parents make me anxious, and I need you to do this because you care about me,\u201d I think you conveyed, \u201cYour jokes are annoying. I agree with my uptight parents. Can you stop being annoying just for one meal?\u201d", "Hmm that does sound complicated. On one hand I feel like it would be better to just let them know, but also you could just let it happen. If you don't plan on having a very close relationship with them anyway, then who cares what they think of your gf? \n\nGiven what the tradition means to her, I don't think that I personally would have asked her not to do it, but I also don't think its the worst thing in the world that you did. I think you should just apologize and tell her what you told us about your parents. Idk if this counts towards the bots voting count since its a reply and not its own comment, but I think my final verdict is NAH.", "Yeah, I think this would get old quick. Like, maybe once a week, would be ok, and cute. But every single night, sounds exhausting.", "IMO What you should do is tell her all about your parents and what kind of people they are so that she can decide if she wants to moderate or change her behavior. Information is the power, here. \n\nI hope you find the sparkle again. Staying in love is easier if you a way to fall in love every day. You have to look for it. You have to lean into it. Good luck.", "Don\u2019t take that sparkle for granted, OP. You\u2019ll likely find it\u2019s absence to be even louder. It\u2019s something that makes your GF her, much like you likely have your own quirks that your GF loves.", "What if she found some chemistry or surgeon jokes?", "If his parents get uncomfortable from someone making a light-hearted joke, then they're ta. They may not enjoy the jokes as much as the gf does, but I can't imagine anyone getting uncomfortable from someone close to the family making a harmless joke at dinner. It's part of making conversation. Many couples/ dinner guests make light jokes while eating, and if anyone can't handle that, they should just refrain from joining anyone as a guest for meals.", "Eh idk.  is making sure your parents aren\u2019t uncomfortable for a few seconds during a joke really worth hurting your partner\u2019s feelings? \n\nI would have even said \u201chey mom and dad just so you know, she has a little joke routine she does at dinner so just go along with it!\u201d", "You missed my ninja edit. But channel that confidence where it's needed. Don't be afraid of them.", "I\u2019m sure she will never measure up. I\u2019ve already heard \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s no Katelyn\u201d which is my lawyer brother\u2019s dentist wife. So the teaching assistant (me) and his garden center employee girlfriend (my gf) won\u2019t be the favorites any time soon.", "Do people on Reddit never get annoyed with the partners? Even cute things can be annoying/stale, under certain circumstances.", "This. Warn her but let her decide", "I wouldn't call serious-minded people AHs for not appreciating such humor; it's quite possible people on the spectrum don't get it and become uncomfortable.  Could also be their personality type, who knows.  But I wouldn't intentionally make them uncomfortable for no reason other than whimsy AND I especially wouldn't do it when trying to make a good first impression.  Better to break out the bad Don Rickles routine after breaking the ice earlier.", "That could work too.  On the flip side it's a rather silly thing to have hurt feelings over, especially ones leading you to abandon your partner for days.  Who could predict that or even the lack of a rational adult conversation over the request?", "So why bother trying? I mean that very literally.\n\nLook, I used to try this for years, trying to fit into a mold that I hated, until I realized that there is nothing I can do that will appease my extended family (and to a lesser extent, mother). They can love me and my family as we are, with all our weird, or they can be silent, because we\u2019re happy. \n\nNAH- you can ask, she can say no, but at the end of the day I don\u2019t think it will get you what you want.", "So stop trying and give yourself the approval you\u2019re desperately trying to get from your parents who won\u2019t give it to you anyways. \n\nWe love the ones we love for who they are, not what they are. \n\nSet yourself free by accepting yourself and being yourself around your parents. \n\nAnd talk to your therapist about how the pendulum swung from dead serious parents to joke a day girlfriend. Girlfriend sounds sweet though don\u2019t get me wrong.", "Nothing wrong with not appreciating humor, just expecting everyone else to be as stale as they are and not tell jokes in a relaxed social setting.", "I\u2019d be curious how exactly OP asked or phrased it. Could go either way!", ">So why bother trying?\n\nThiiiiisss!!! Seriously...it's time, energy, and emotion straight down the toilet.", "I don't think they're expecting the jokes at all; OP is warning his GF that her jokes are likely to be klangers instead of landing.  \n\nThe whole point of this is, after all, a smooth introduction of each party.  Better to find common ground than likely disagreement."]}
