Every Christmas we visit his family out of town. We currently spend two nights/three days at their house. My MIL\u2019s birthday falls right around Christmas, so the first day we do her birthday dinner, next day Christmas, last day we leave around noon. \n\nTheir house is filthy. I don\u2019t mean a bit of dust and clutter - I\u2019m talking years of grime and dirt that has built up. Layers of dust everywhere. Every surface in the house, from counter tops in the kitchen, light switches, walls, floors - all of it is filthy. For the record, I\u2019m not a germaphobe or a clean freak. Cobwebs everywhere, detritus on the floors that never get vacuumed. Don\u2019t get me started on the bathroom. It\u2019s revolting. I was so disgusted last year that at night when everyone had gone to bed, I asked my partner to get me some cleaning spray and I cleaned the toilet and the sink myself, just so that I could feel somewhat comfortable brushing my teeth and using the toilet. The bedroom we sleep in has the carcasses of dead bugs and dust bunnies all along the baseboards. I feel repulsed eating food there as I know it is being prepared in an unclean kitchen. Ironically, I won\u2019t shower there, because the shower is so gross. I just give myself a good scrub at my house before we leave and make sure to pack my deodorant. \n\nI have brought this up to my partner before. The first couple of years we were together, we would be there for four days/three nights until I said \u201cno\u201d. He compromised so now we are on the current three day/two night plan. This year I found myself completely fed up with this situation. On the drive home, I brought it up again. I offered to rent a car for next year (we have one vehicle) and I would drive up Christmas morning and then home after Christmas dinner. I would miss my MIL\u2019s birthday dinner the day before, which isn\u2019t really anything special (just a cake, my partner doesn\u2019t get her a gift). I also offered to host them at our house instead on Christmas. I told him that his expectation that I should put up with this was unreasonable and unfair. He got very upset and we had an argument with no resolution on this matter. He thinks I should make this sacrifice for his sake and that I\u2019m being a \u201cprincess\u201d. He said he accommodates my family and I should do the same for his. He also said that this would make things awkward for him if he had to explain why I\u2019m no longer spending multiple days there.\n\nI understand that sacrifices have to be made in relationships. But AITA for telling my partner that he is asking me to sacrifice too much by expecting me to spend multiple days in an absolutely disgusting, unclean house?", "created_utc": 1703796497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t443h/aita_for_telling_my_so_i_dont_want_to_spend_xmas/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should also have made it clear to everyone why you did this. The people living in a midden like that and expecting other people to join them should have been called out on their lack of standards.

It\u2019s a very awkward discussion.", "that's just being part of a family, not wallowing in filth or risking your health in an environment where pests and contaminants are not cleaned before preparing food. Is this another example of the warped norms his family have passed down?

I'm unsure if you want kids in the future, but can you imagine having kids in that filthy house?!?!\n\nWho cares if it's awkward?

It would likely need a lot of social massaging to get to a point where that's seen positively. \n\nBut hey, maybe I'm wrong. Good luck if you go this route.", "Don't stay at their house anymore. Stay at a hotel. Or, drive there for the day, then drive down another day, then drive down another day. You don't sleep at your parents' home, so you don't have to sleep at his parents' home. Hire Geek Squad so he can't hold that over your head. Don't let him book any vacations anymore. Once you do all that then you can tell him that you aren't staying at his parents home anymore.\n\nNow, ideally you could have a serious talk with him about the pig sty they live in, but he apparently doesn't see it as a problem, which is quite frankly disgusting. Since that doesn't seem to be a possibility, tell him as a Christmas gift that the two of you are going to send over a cleaning crew to clean the whole house. Tell them, \"It's a Christmas miracle!\"", "Thank you."]}
