Every Christmas we visit his family out of town. We currently spend two nights/three days at their house. My MIL\u2019s birthday falls right around Christmas, so the first day we do her birthday dinner, next day Christmas, last day we leave around noon. \n\nTheir house is filthy. I don\u2019t mean a bit of dust and clutter - I\u2019m talking years of grime and dirt that has built up. Layers of dust everywhere. Every surface in the house, from counter tops in the kitchen, light switches, walls, floors - all of it is filthy. For the record, I\u2019m not a germaphobe or a clean freak. Cobwebs everywhere, detritus on the floors that never get vacuumed. Don\u2019t get me started on the bathroom. It\u2019s revolting. I was so disgusted last year that at night when everyone had gone to bed, I asked my partner to get me some cleaning spray and I cleaned the toilet and the sink myself, just so that I could feel somewhat comfortable brushing my teeth and using the toilet. The bedroom we sleep in has the carcasses of dead bugs and dust bunnies all along the baseboards. I feel repulsed eating food there as I know it is being prepared in an unclean kitchen. Ironically, I won\u2019t shower there, because the shower is so gross. I just give myself a good scrub at my house before we leave and make sure to pack my deodorant. \n\nI have brought this up to my partner before. The first couple of years we were together, we would be there for four days/three nights until I said \u201cno\u201d. He compromised so now we are on the current three day/two night plan. This year I found myself completely fed up with this situation. On the drive home, I brought it up again. I offered to rent a car for next year (we have one vehicle) and I would drive up Christmas morning and then home after Christmas dinner. I would miss my MIL\u2019s birthday dinner the day before, which isn\u2019t really anything special (just a cake, my partner doesn\u2019t get her a gift). I also offered to host them at our house instead on Christmas. I told him that his expectation that I should put up with this was unreasonable and unfair. He got very upset and we had an argument with no resolution on this matter. He thinks I should make this sacrifice for his sake and that I\u2019m being a \u201cprincess\u201d. He said he accommodates my family and I should do the same for his. He also said that this would make things awkward for him if he had to explain why I\u2019m no longer spending multiple days there.\n\nI understand that sacrifices have to be made in relationships. But AITA for telling my partner that he is asking me to sacrifice too much by expecting me to spend multiple days in an absolutely disgusting, unclean house?", "created_utc": 1703796497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t443h/aita_for_telling_my_so_i_dont_want_to_spend_xmas/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have stood up about this way sooner than five years in.\n\nI am assuming you do most of the cleaning in your home?  You realize he has normalized this?\n\nJust refuse to go.  Period.  There is zero reason you should have to stay/eat in such an uncomfortable situation.  Realize, there may be consequences though, but you have to pick your battles.\n\nIs this worth it.  For many....it would be, for others...not so much.", "NTA their house sounds like a health hazard. He is enabling them to be unclean.", "NTA but don\u2019t they have any other people around them that tell them this is not ok? Or at least imply or something? I mean they should have seen the signs of disgust on your face or other people\u2019s faces even if you try to hide it. Also, how\u2019s your bf not embarrassed by this and even asking/pressuring you to go along with him? How\u2019s his self or home hygiene habits?", "INFO\n\nWhat accommodations is he making for your family? Are they at all similar?", "NTA.  This is a hill to die on.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't want to stay or eat in a place like you have described. \n\nTBH I would just refuse to go and if they ask why you are not going tell them, sorry your house is a disgusting shithole.\n\nIf you don't want to be quite as forthright as I would be, book a hotel or AirBNB, but don't stay at their house, suggest eating out.", "NTA - I\u2019d be so grossed out, personally. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d do - \u201cMIL/FIL, we really do enjoy staying at your house for the holidays, but this year we\u2019ve opted to get a hotel room.\u201d  Then when we show up, bring some grocery store foods and paper plates/utensils. I wouldn\u2019t eat anything out of that kitchen either. Ew", "NTA. Unsure how to broach it with the family, but is there anyway you could get them to pay for a yearly deep cleaning (or 2x a year) ? For example just before Christmas: this way they can be proud to show their home and the general cleanliness level will be much higher. \n\nI'd hate it, too. Personally. Dust I don't care, but sketchy dirt in the bathroom and co is just gross.", "NTA - His parents are revolting, I wouldn't stay there or eat food there either. I think the only possible compromise for seeing them is for them to come to you guys and celebrate at your house instead. But only if you are certain they don't carry bed bugs or roaches! Even staying at a hotel won't solve the food problem.", "How old are the parents?  Was the house filthy during your partner\u2019s childhood?   Are there any signs of cognitive decline?  If this is something that happened as they aged, then they may need some assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).   All that clutter can be a fall risk, and falls can be deadly for geriatrics. \n\nIf this is just how they\u2019ve always lived, then it\u2019s time to start staying at a hotel. NTA.", "NTA. You could make yourselves sick from eating food prepared in a filthy kitchen. I would also find it very hard to sleep in a room such as you describe. I think the mistake that you have made here is not to lay down a hard boundary about not spending time in such conditions from the very start. You should also have made it clear to everyone why you did this. The people living in a midden like that and expecting other people to join them should have been called out on their lack of standards. Maybe that would have made them wake up and grab a vacuum cleaner, some soapy water and some rags and do something about it. When someone pretends that these conditions are normal, even for just a few days per year, it becomes a problem.", "would they accept a cleaning team as a xmas present? Maybe they are struggling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmaybe the son should maybe mention the dust?", "NTA. His parents most likely do not realize how bad things are in their house because they have seen it for decades. It sounds like you love them, but cannot tolerate the living conditions. It might also be that they are not able to clean their place and need help.\nWell before Christmas next year, you and SO should hire a cleaning company to clean the main rooms, kitchen, the room you will be sleeping in, and the bathrooms. Take their parents out for the day so they can see the difference when they get back. If they like it, tell them you will gift them a monthly cleaning as an early Christmas present. If they don\u2019t like it, get a hotel when you visit.", "NTA. Your partner should not be asking this of you. A compromise you might consider would be a hotel when you visit them. This is something my husband and I started doing as his mom is a hoarder and I finally had enough of staying in a dirty, crowded house. And because we go to the hotel together, there was no need for an explanation. If she asked for one the answer would\u2019ve been that we like our space and don\u2019t like putting her out (since she usually would sleep on the couch so we could have the only bed for ourselves and our kids). But your in laws house is a biohazard And you can absolutely get sick from any one of the things you\u2019ve described. Stand your ground and refuse to stay or eat there.", "NTA. If you have the disposable income, might I suggest a hotel as a comfortable middle ground? I started doing that years ago b/c my parents have dogs and I'm just not a dog person, but that's my problem and not theirs. Win-win!", "NTA\n\nSacrifices yes. Risking your health just to be polite no", "This happened to me when I used to stay at my sister\u2019s house over the holidays.  The toilet was so disgusting I didn\u2019t even want to sit on it.\n\nFinally I just started staying at a hotel.  I just told her I\u2019m more comfortable on my own, but she was pretty offended anyway. But eventually she got over it!\n\nNTA. Splurge for a hotel.", "NTA it's not fair you keep spending Christmas with them every year any way nevermind their dirty house. You could stay in a hotel instead but you would still have to eat and sit in a dirty house. Does your husband not care how it affects his parents health?", "NTA.  He can go without you.", "NTA I'd refuse to go before you get ill", "Nta\n\n\nWhy are you spending every Christmas with them?\n\n\n\nI would never spend the night in a home like you described.  And to be honest, I would question his judgment.", "NTA. My oldest friend had multiple cats and she and her family were always in a passive-aggressive stand-off about who should do the litter. I couldn't be there. If I had to be I had to use an old nurse's trick to made bad smells tolerable - Vicks in the nose.", "NTA\n\nI am a messy person, but that house is a health risk. I wouldn\u2019t go at a and he could be sulky all he wanted. If I were to go I\u2019d stay at a hotel. \n\nAnd they know their house is filthy. Maybe it would be good for them if someonw told them.", "How the hell have you put up with it this long? I would have noped out of their the first day and the first year and stayed in a hotel and eaten out and not at their house. God knows what creepy crawlies including bed bugs you may be bringing home. NTA and if your partner cannot see this for the health hazard it is then they have blinders on..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We\u2019ve been at family gatherings there with extended family. What do they think? The house is small with only one main bathroom (the other bathroom is an en suite in the main bedroom). Everyone uses the main bathroom. They have to notice how gross it is. \n\nI think my BF is embarassed, which is partially why he got so upset. It\u2019s been very difficult to broach this subject for that reason. I\u2019m basically telling him his parents are dirty. It\u2019s awkward as hell.\n\nHis personal hygiene is great, but when we first got together I had to instill in him a basic level of cleanliness regarding our living space.

His mother doesn\u2019t like cleaning. Father is supposed to clean the bathroom, but clearly doesn\u2019t. Both are able bodied with no cognitive decline.", "I agree, I made a mistake in not laying down the boundaries earlier. I guess I was hoping that maybe things might get better (wishful thinking), or my SO would say something to them. Clearly that isn\u2019t going to happen.", "They\u2019re not struggling.

Works for me and my husband because our environmental allergies are ridiculous and cleaning makes a huge difference.\n\nEdit to add: would she accept the gift of a deep cleaning prior to her birthday and holidays? My mom would LOVE that and she's all about cleaning, cooking, and entertaining."]}
