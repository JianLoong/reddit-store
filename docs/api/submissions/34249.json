They are loving a baby that is named after someone that made their lives H E L L and she has the nerve to be mad they won\u2019t acknowledge his name?! You can\u2019t make sense out of nonsense! I would\u2019ve named my baby \u2018ABCDEFG\u2019 first!", "NTA - it\u2019s so amazing that you are a united front with your wife and standing up for her. Just continue to support your wife and if you ever feel the need to confront Paula again just make sure to discuss with your wife first. It\u2019s her family so it\u2019s really important you listen to how she wants to handle this.", ">Paula was bitching that everyone was so loving and doting to her son but refused to acknowledge the name to her\n\nHuh, I wonder if she was actually hoping to provoke anger, and looking for a confrontation about it, and she\u2019s disappointed that no one took the bait. Otherwise, why would she be so bothered that everyone (except Eve) is just loving her baby, with no comment one way or the other about the name? She would have to be pretty oblivious to expect the family to gush about her choice to \u201chonor\u201d someone who they all agree was a bad person.

In any case, you are NTA for saying what you said, OP.", "NTA\n\nYou only told the truth. Screw them, they are not your family. They are your in laws. Your WIFE is your family, and you did your job and protected her from abuse she thought she had escaped with her abuser's death. Best. Spouse. Ever.!", "Insane and very intentional she did that. Nta", "NTA. However it should be recognized that David ( the kiddo, not the grandfather ) is innocent in all of this mess. I hope at some point in the future you all can be friendly with him even though his name brings on painful memories.\n\nPaula on the other hand, seems like she exists to get a rise out of people. I would reward that energy with ignoring her existence for a significant period of time.", "Why would anyone respect that name? She knew what she was doing. She was knew what kind of a man she named her son after. \n\nI'm tired of assholes acting so clueless. NTA", "NTA", "NTA because the family need to respect the fact that David was a MASSIVE problem in your life and that to name there child in respect and admiration of that man is by default an attack on you and anyone else who suffered what he has said and done. You have all the right to as a result cut ties with that person as they are on the \u201cdark side\u201d.", "NTA, David's getting a little brother Adolf, surely.", "NTA\n\n\nI could be way off base here, but are you insinuating that Paula named her son after a known kiddy diddler?

If SIL has the audacity to complain politely inform her that you and your wife refuse to honor the memory of such a vile person. Of course, if there is no interaction it's a non issue but others in the family who agree with you could follow this example. Sounds like SIL wants attention even if it's negative attention. Poor little baby.", "Nta. If her kid somehow found out he\u2019s named after an abusive man, im sure he will change his name legally the moment he turns 18 and will go no contact", "NTA but unsure why paula didn't have a bad experience with grand father. yeah you name a child after someone who was hated and are surprised people don't make a fuss over it? The 2nd Marx brother changed his name from Adolph to Arthur because of a bad name and paula goes an invokes it?", "nta. fuck paula", "NTA", "NTA not at all.", "NTA. Paula's relationship with her father is her own business, but she can't expect everybody else to share whatever fondness made her decide he needed a namesake.

You said nothing untrue or unkind.\n\nWe have something similar going on in my family right now, though thankfully not to this extent. (The relative isn't an actual criminal, \"just\" abusive.)

How is this worth cutting ties to Paula over? \n\nDavid is the 44th most common name given to boys  in 2022.  \n\nSo, she's called her son David and she wants to say he's named after her maternal grandfather, who was an evil SOB that everyone in the world except Paula was glad to see into the grave.\n\nSo: you don't accept that the boy is called after him!

Let Paula's memorial to the evil old SOB stand: that's TA.  Change the narrative, you outnumber her.\n\nBut if this stands: ESH.", "ESH here. Maybe it wasn't the best idea to choose a tainted name, but your wife needs to realize that the man she hated is dead and a name is basically meaningless.  It's just a few letters, nothing more, nothing less. This child is not a reincarnation of the grandfather.

And everyone including Paula knows that.\n\nSo Paula saying she is naming her son David in honor of the grandpa is pretty much telling the wife I am naming my son in honor of the man that molested you. It is completely reasonable to cut ties and go no contact with a person that would do that, especially a sibling.\n\nYou are right about it not being the kids fault, but nobody said it was. Nobody is blaming the kid. The post says the rest of the family is loving and doting on the boy. It doesn't sound to me like OP or his wife have any hard feeling against the kid either.

Then tell the kid that their mom did this to them on purpose. Throw a wrench in that family dynamic.", "Trust me. Kid will start to realise the hesitation or at least the slight pause before using his name and he's going to wonder what's up. I don't know if he needs to hear full details, but a \"your grandfather was a very bad man and the name reminds us of him. It's not you, we still love you\" in an age appropriate manner is enough.  \n\n\nBecause reading between the lines...yikes", "No. That\u2019s abusive to the child you absolutely vile person.
