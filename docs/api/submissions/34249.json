Some people deserve permanent shame.", "Has anyone thought that maybe Paula is struggling to deal with trauma and this is her way of doing so? Sometimes people want to pretend the abuse or trauma never happened and ignore it entirely. Paula naming her son in honor of his great-grandfather could very well be an attempt to block out that trauma by associating it with something good. Grief and feeling guilt over that grief can also play a role in this. If Paula grieved\u2014which people have no control over feeling\u2014her abusive grandfather\u2019s death, she could be feeling guilty and trying to reason with herself that the clearly the abuse couldn\u2019t have been that bad, so she\u2019s named her son in honor of her grandfather to justify her reasoning.\n\nNow, obviously this isn\u2019t healthy and Paula should be seeing a therapist if she isn\u2019t, but I think the rest of the family ignoring these possibilities and just cutting Paula out is a shitty thing to do. I\u2019m willing to give everyone the benefit of the doubt here, but you all need to sit down and have a meaningful conversation about this instead of ignoring everyone\u2019s valid emotions and reactions to past trauma before deciding the relationship isn\u2019t worth holding onto.\n\nAlso age is an important thing to consider here. Is Paula young enough that she doesn\u2019t really remember the abuse? Did she block out the bad memories and only remember good ones?
