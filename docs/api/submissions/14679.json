And am just honestly wondering if I\u2019m the asshole. \n\nJust to set some context, the house is a rental, with four of us on the lease, myself and three others. \n\nDecember last year one of my housemates asked if they could have two friends stay with us for a month while they worked in the area that we live in, to save up some money for their overseas trip (they are from a town approximately 4 hours away). I didn\u2019t have a problem with this as it was only a month, and we all agreed they would pay their share in rent and bills.\n\nAbout halfway into the month they asked if they could extend their stay until May, making it a four month stay instead, at the time it was fine, and they are lovely people so figured everything would be fine. During that time some things had been bothering me such as the guests creating rosters for us to clean up/take out the bins, as we\u2019ve never had to have anything like that, as we all respect each other and keep the place clean. I ended up saying something to the housemate and said that this isn\u2019t their place to be making rules, and that\u2019s made me uncomfortable, considering I\u2019d still been doing all the big jobs like mopping and deep cleaning common areas. \nThe roster was then scrapped and we haven\u2019t had any issues since. \n\nAbout four weeks ago the guests went away for a week and it was really calm and peaceful at home, and it really put it into perspective for me how crowded the house was when the guests came back. But we only had about a month left until they were leaving so I was happy to let them stay until the time we agreed upon. \nThey have now asked if they could stay until the end of June as they haven\u2019t made enough money to go travelling, I expressed that I would prefer if we went with the original date as it\u2019s getting too crowded for me, and I\u2019m honestly worried about the realestate finding out about the extra people. \n\nThe guests pleaded that they are desperate and that they would have nowhere else to go at such short notice, and how hard it would be for them to move out now and asked that I think about the decision further.\nEveryone in the house has said they don\u2019t mind and have left the decision up to me, which has honestly been stressful. They are nice people and I don\u2019t want them to be upset, but it\u2019s beginning to take a tole on me mentally, and I just want the house to go back to just the original four.\n\nSo WIBTA if I don\u2019t let them extend their stay?\n\nUPDATE.\nI spoke with my housemate, and told them that my decision was that they\u2019d have to be out by the 1st of May. They completely respect my decision and are more than grateful that I\u2019d even considered letting them stay longer. I haven\u2019t spoken to the guests yet as they are at work, but I am planning on speaking to them tomorrow. My housemate is certain that they will be respectful of my decision, obviously a bit upset with the situation, but they will have to work it out themselves.

They have tenants rights mow, so good luck on getting them out. You'd best start looking for new place yourself before you all get evicted or they never leave.", "NTA\n\nThey said they would have nowhere else to go on such \u201cshort notice\u201d?  Wasn\u2019t this extension of their stay discussed four months ago?  Ugh\u2026\n\nReminds me of a joke a friend told me years ago: \u201cKnow how you can tell if a hippie has been sleeping on your couch? They\u2019re still there!\u201d", "NTA.

They already extended, they aren't guests anymore, they are living there.", "INFO: They\u2019re so desperate but can afford to go out town for a week and contribute to rent?

Their overseas trip is no more important than your peaceful enjoyment of your home. You also shouldn't be putting your own lease in jeopardy for their sake.\n\nThe guests have already overstayed once, and who knows if they will ever save enough. Overseas travel is a luxury, why should you be miserable in order for them to travel?", "NTA. You have been very generous. A one month stay became 4 months and now they want 6. Oh, no, no, no. If I were you I'd be thinking the whole \"We just need to save some money for a trip\" thing was a fraud probably from the get-go - it certainly now isn't plausible. It's your home, not a shelter. You have the right to feel comfortable at your home. And the fact that your roommates are leaving the decision up to you rather than taking a real position sounds like they may also be ready for it to end but are hoping you'll be the bad cop for them.", "NTA\n\nNice people don't overstay their welcome. They have to realize how unfair this has been to the others. If I'm being frank, it's strange how the people not on the lease are getting the biggest benefit from this. \n\nThey may need to visit one less place, get cheaper hotels or food or pick up dinner odd jobs while traveling - but that's for them to figure out. There's no realistic way that one more month of mooching is the make or break for this world travel.  \n\nA lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on you.", "NTA. They are guests in your home, and they have far out stayed their welcome. You have no obligation to continue allowing them to stay there, and as you said it could even create issues with you keeping your place seeing as it's technically unauthorized subletting.", "These people are squatters. It's giving flophouse. Get them out.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been more than accommodating and extended it waaay beyond the original date asked. It\u2019s not your fault they haven\u2019t been doing their homework and finding out a better living situation for themselves.", "NTA, these people have no motivation to move on and very likely won't unless forced to.  You have all been overly accommodating and they are taking advantage at this point.  To me the person who needs to tell them to leave is the housemate who talked you all into letting them stay.  It is unfair to place the burden on you.  What does your lease say about guests? What rights have the 'guests' acquired since they have lived with you so long?  You may need to officially evict them if they don't agree to leave of their own accord.", "NTA.  They're taking advantage of you.", "NTA\n\nThough after staying so long they likely have renters rights (at least in the US). And could force you to go through a proper eviction to get them out. This is the reason well written rental contacts have provisions not allowing you to have people live there. \n\nThis is something that needs to be fixed. It can get much much worse.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a right to make your opinion known. They can go home to their parents, relatives etc . Or use the money they earn so far.

No thanks.", "op=NTA\n\nand in june it will be---we need another few months and then it will be --it's winter so we need to get thru the winter.\n\nThis will just keep extending.

You helped them with housing when they were in need to save up. \n\nIt's your house and the house being over crowded is taking it's toll.\n\nThe sooner you put your foot down the better, they'll just get more and more comfortable with extending their stay.", "NTA they're sponging.
