Of course I said yes, and invited them over for dinner with my husband (M35), kids (M8 and F6), and I. What my brother failed to mention was that his girlfriend had two kids herself (F4 and F3), and I was a little taken aback when a party of four arrived at the house last night for dinner, instead of a party of two.\n\nPlease also bear in mind that I have never met my brother's girlfriend (of three weeks, I might add) before, so I was surprised when she told her kids that my husband and I were their 'new auntie and uncle'. I know that some people like to call their elders 'aunt' or 'uncle', so I initially brushed it off but I especially did not like when she introduced my children to hers as their 'new cousins'. It all just felt very, very familar for a woman I have never met, and children I did not even know existed. It also felt like she was forcing her family onto mine in a strange way.\n\nIn the moment, I just said to my children that her children were not cousins but were new friends. She did seem a bit put off by that, but the rest of dinner went relatively smoothly.\n\nMy brother gave me a call today and was furious that I had make his girlfriend feel unwelcome and as if she were not part of the family. I told him that she was not part of the family, and was actually a strange woman telling her children that I was their aunt. He said that she had a tough home life and was just looking for something to be a part of, and 'how dare \\[I\\] stand in the way of her building a new family with \\[him\\]'. I explained that she seemed nice enough but I was uncomfortable with the interaction, and he said that I should not count on getting an invitation for their hypothetical future wedding.\n\nMy husband feels that I was right and it was all a bit strange, but my mom said that I maybe should have just let it slide as it wasn't a big deal and there is a high possibility of me never having to see her again as this is my brother's fourth girlfriend in as many months.\n\nI don't really know if I was right to have redirected her words in front of my kids, or maybe I was the AH and should have just let it go for the sake of my brother.

That's just absurd and your brother should have put her in her place, not go off on you.", "NTA. \n\nThat sounds very uncomfortable. You had every right to react the way that you did. You have never met this girl before and your brother did not mention her kids. It would\u2019ve been good to just meet the girlfriend and then later, if they\u2019re still together, meet her kids. It was pretty much forced onto you. \n\nSure she may have had a tough home life but that doesn\u2019t mean you have an obligation to become her best friend right then and there and get your kids involved with hers. There\u2019s no rush to that and he shouldn\u2019t try and make you feel guilty for the way you reacted.\n\nYou can be nice and respectful and include her but she\u2019s still just a stranger right now. They didn\u2019t need to bring her kids along, and if they had no choice it should\u2019ve been communicated with you.", "NTA. Firstly your brother should have mentioned there would be four people coming over. Secondly, you just met this woman and know nothing about her, so it\u2019s presumptive for her to expect to be instantly a part of the family", "Your kids come first, it\u2019s important to be clear with them, especially if they looked to you for an explanation to this strange lady\u2019s claims. She sounds like a drama queen: if you are not with her, you must be against her! She cannot conceive that she might have been acting inappropriately. Don\u2019t worry, if your brother has any sense, it won\u2019t last!  NTA", "NTA. The girlfriend is an AH for taking this kind of liberties with a complete stranger and her (yours) kids. Your brother is being irrational and his reaction is very emotional, which is not wrong per s\u00e8, but maybe it could be beneficial to talk about it in a relaxed environment with just the two of you, to make it clear that if she makes him happy, than you are happy for him, that you respect her, but that your feelings are valid and he needs to take them into consideration.", "NTA. Yikes!", ">there is a high possibility of me never having to see her again as this is my brother's fourth girlfriend in as many months.\n\nAll the more reason for you to have an issue with the kids being introduced as cousins. \n\nNTA", "NTA, it's not like she's been dating your brother for years or something. For a first time interaction it's weird, strange, bizarre, all the words. In the last couple of years I've only started calling my uncles wife my aunt and they've been married for over 10 years.", "NTA you had to set the boundaries and expectations immediately for the benefit of her kids. They cant be lied to and told they have a new aunt and cousins and to expect things from this relationship and then be left disappointed.  It had to be immediately clarified. Also your kids should not have people show up in their life that might be off in a few weeks.  Maybe they shouldnt have even met her yet until it was a stable relationship tbh.\n\nAlso if they marry they will be step cousins. If he adopts them them they will be cousins.", "NTA.\n\nI don't subscribe to the whole \"you have to be married to be part of the family\" thing, however, they haven't been together long and this is the first time you have met her and her kids. \n\nAdditionally you said this to your children and you are absolutely right to put comfort boundaries in place for them. It would be completely confusing to them for you to just \"let it slide\" and have them be introduced as cousins when they aren't.", "NTA\n\nWhat the GF looks for is what she should provide herself: family. It's actually rather sad that she became preggo the first time when she was 15/16 years old and a child herself. It speaks volumes against her parents but:\n\nIt's not an others family duty to take of that. She needs to build a stable relationship with your brother first and foremost.", "NTA They are not married yet so you were right in saying that.", "NTA. They\u2019re not engaged and barely know each other. You don\u2019t owe her sisterhood until he puts a damn ring on it!", "NTA. If your brother had wanted this to turn out differently he would have had a conversation with you first. Instead, he chose to surprise you and he expected you to behave exactly as he wanted you to do in his imagination.", "NTA. They just started dating so no, she's not part of the family. And besides if your brother didn't see anything weird in bringing the kids why didn't he just give you a heads up about it? THAT was rude, not you telling your kids that two girls they just met and might actually never see again (who knows how long their relationship might last considering they just started dating) are indeed not family.", "NTA.  I'm sure you handled yourself as diplomatically as you could.  But my gosh, of course you are  going to have a visible reaction when a 19 yr old shows up with TWO children, has only been dating your brother for 3 weeks and is already planning on making him a dad/husband/partner.  Sounds like this young woman is desperate to get out of her parents' home and anybody will do.  But yeah, if your bro is going thru girlfriends this quickly, I'd say let it go for now.  \n\nHow she told her children that the other children were cousins, you are Aunt and Uncle, is WRONG.  She may be giving those poor babies false hope  :(", "NTA", "NTA - I guess you could have waited until she left\u2026but then she wouldn\u2019t know that it bothered you and the issue would have arisen again later. Plus, you were very kind about correcting her. My instinct would have been the same as yours, but I wouldn\u2019t have come out so gracefully.", "NTA. \n\n\nI have milk in my fridge that\u2019s older than this relationship. Boundaries are important in relationships and wanting to push the family angle so quickly is red flag territory. Next time he asks to introduce a partner ask him how many you\u2019ll be expected to set the table for to head off any surprise guests.", "NTA. THREE WEEKS??? HE shouldn't have even met those kids yet. That girl isn't looking for a partner; she's looking to saddle another person with the responsibility of her children.", "NTA but not that much polite or nice act!

Speaking from experience of a former friend with similar problems as hers: if you allow yourself to get sucked in, she will make her problems your family's responsibility, as well as demanding more and more of your emotional energy which is hard to disengage from. I wish I had recognised these traits in my former friend sooner than I did; it would've saved me a *lot* of grief.\n\nIf your brother wants to take responsibility for her issues, then he can fill his boots, but it's not your immediate family's job to paper over the cracks in her upbringing and indulge her unhealthy coping mechanisms. You did the right thing by putting your foot down and establishing boundaries with her, not only for the sake of your comfort and wellbeing but your kids' too.", "Nta\n\nYou're right.

Basing this solely off of the idea she is desperately seeking a family to be a part of, to the point she is delusional about her role in your life or your extended family\u2019s life in general. The delusion won\u2019t hold up after a while and she will need something tangible and permanent.", "NTA\n\nYour brother shouldn't have even met the kids yet let alone you being introduced as auntie!", "NTA. This person clearly lacks boundaries, you wisely enforced them and better earlier than later. Yes down the road you may become family but a 3 week relationship, meeting unknown children without warning and then trying to force a family relationship is way too soon.", "He shouldn't have even met her kids yet, never mind you guys.

This woman you barely just met 15min ago; good for you to shut it down quick.", "NTA.

Showing up unannounced with kids and declaring that you are family 3 weeks in was rude and presumptuous.", "NTA \n\nThey have been dating for all of 3 weeks and that was her first time meeting you.

With time hopefully your brother will see that this was fucking crazy.\n\nShow him the AITAH where everyone tore this woman a new asshole for introducing her kids to her boyfriends parents as grandma and grandpa the first time they met. \n\nRelationship ended right after lol.", "NTA It sounds like a weird interaction and a valid response. Your brother might be in a sort of honeymoon phase, it might blow under the rug if a big deal isn't made.", "Nta.  How confusing  for your children to be told strangers that may not be in their lives next week are family. You did the right thing. Your brother and his latest fling are the a holes.", "NTA. It was quite rude to ambush you with two additional people you didn\u2019t even know existed. Gf was way out of line trying to push your family into unestablished roles because she wants to live out some fantasy. At just three weeks, it was too early for her to even introduce her children to your brother. She is trying to force a family dynamic that doesn\u2019t exist, at least not yet.

I didn't become \"aunt\" until I married his uncle when he was 5. After losing a few nieces and nephews after break ups, I was more than happy to wait for that title. My kids have aunts and uncles that aren't even related but these people have been in our lives since before the kids were even born. I couldn't imagine trying to tell them that uncle they barely knows new gf they've never met is their aunt. Why would you set your kids up for failure like that? They already ask why they never see uncles a and b but they live far away so they kind of understand. Clearly from my ramble y'all can tell it baffles me why anyone would think it's a good idea to introduce someone as family when they haven't even been around long enough to have met before.", "Shit, I've been with my boyfriend for three years and his brother and SIL just this summer started referring to me as 'auntie' to their kids (3 & 1ish). And they started it, I still think it's a little weird!\n\nninja edit for spelling", "I mean, I suspect OP\u2019s brother never mentioned to his GF that he never asked OP about bringing GF\u2019s kids\u2026 I doubt very much GF brought her kids without OP\u2019s brother\u2019s blessing.

They are old enough. I would have actually turned things around and made it awkward on your brother asking when is the wedding and are they serious, etc.", "I agree NTA!!  Tell your brother that being a truly integrated part of a family is a slow thing not an instant thing.  She might be a great person but only time will tell if things bond deeply for all of you.  It's not emotionally healthy for kids to deal with the adults in their lives giving them temporary family. Creating instant cousins, that may not be part of their lives if his relationship with her doesn't last more than a few weeks months or year or so is harmful for her kids and yours. You have every right to protect your children from that kind of emotional turmoil. And you would hope that she would read whatever self-help books are necessary to understand that it is bad for her kids too.", "100%! NTA but I feel bad for the brother\u2019s GF. She grew up in a dysfunctional environment and doesn\u2019t understand normal boundaries. I wonder if she spent time in the foster system as well.", "Exactly. This poor child having children, probably looking for a ready made family out of desperation. Still, OP is NTA.", "No it's entirely possible she was aware. Or didn't care either way.  She doesn't seem to make good life choices if she's introducing her kids to her boyfriend of three weeks and insisting they're family.", "Not to mention having a three and a four year old at 19. This woman routinely makes very poor choices.", "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH. That just sounds like a bunch of rape. I fucking hate this species."]}
