Such a shame that you are old enough to stand up to her and say it is NOT your plan (and for goodness sake do not let them move in even short term!)", "As a sole  mother when   in my 30s,  who was told ! by  my mother that I would be looking after her( she had many many health issues). ... I say do not do this. Do not let them ride roughshod over you.  Do not let them guilt you that you are their child and it's your responsibility.    Do not let them move in.  You will never have a life", "NTA - it sounds as though you have never been a free woman.\n\nNO is a great word and it is time for you to use it.  This is not a good idea and your health will only suffer.\n\nAre you their only  child or are you the only person willing to deal with them?", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYour mother is abusive so is your father.....grilling a woman in her 40s is so wrong in so many ways. \n\nRefuse.  Say NO you are not moving in with me", "(They could AirB&B her old room to pay off their debts.)", "Do not even give them a spare key! I am sure your aunt left you the house for a reason.\n\nPlus, if you sold it to them, there's no way they would give you the amount it's actually worth.", "Try to get therapy to learn to stand up for yourself . NTA but say no", "NTA\n\nits your house, your rules \n\ndo whatever you want and don\u2019t feel guilt, you should be able to do what you want without feeling trapped in your own home", "NTA\u2026you are 46.  Stop letting your mom dictate your life.  \u201cUh what mom?   Sorry, nope.  We are not living together.  You will not be moving in with me.  And even if I was crazy enough to consider it, you will not be changing my home.\u201d  When she asks questions, \u201cyou want to know this why?\u201d  Sorry mom, no reason for you to know or ask these questions.  I am an adult living in my own.  You need to set your boundaries, be firm and stick by them.  Just tell mom no, or whatever your reply is to a question and do not leave it up for debate.  Walk away.  Or mom, I said no and that is final.  I am not talking about this anymore.  Leave, hang up or walk away.  Whatever you have to do.", "Nta. \nStraight up tell them no. You are an adult and you are allowed to do so. They are not allowed to move into your home without your consent, You could actually call the police and have them removed. Their situation is their own to figure out and deal with. You have given them enough, and your mom clearly doesn't seem to appreciate any of it. You did not have to become her carer, you could have told her to hire one. But you did it. Because let's be honest, any carer that she would have hired, probably would have quit long ago and she would have had a hard time finding another one based on her attitude."]}
