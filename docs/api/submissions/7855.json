I am clearly not privy to the reasons because things are fine with me and my parents. When N went to college she met her creative writing professor as a freshman and they got close immediately. They would do a lot together and worked closely on a few different writing projects. N never specifically said this, but it was obvious to anyone who saw them interact that they had a substitute mother/daughter type relationship. Which hurt my mom a lot to see. I always thought she'd grow out of it or that the prof would move on but ten years later they were still very close. \n\nAbout a month ago the prof died unexpectedly and it devastated N. She was really dperessed over the holidays which of course was all in front of my mom and was a difficult reminder that N loved the prof as a mother way more than she ever loved my mom as a mother. She still talks to my parents and stuff and they don't fight or anything but N is very distant and doesn't tell them anything about her life beyond the bare minimum. My mom tried to comfort N but N was doing her distant thing and didn't want comfort. \n\nSomething unfortunate that happened to N is that when she got the call that she died, she was brewing tea and in the shock of the news she spilled boiling water on her arm which burned her kinda badly on her wrist. I think the burn was like on the borderline of 2nd and 3rd degree, and definitely still looked pretty rough during the holidays. N said it was especially hard because in addition to the physical pain, every time she looks at it she is reminded of the moment she found out the prof died. Which I totally get.\n\nI was on facetime with N and she said she talked to her tattoo artist friend who said that the burn should be able to heal well enough to get a tattoo over it. N then excitedly told me about her idea which is a type of flower that the prof gave her a bouquet of for her undergrad graduation. My mom was so embarrassed that day because she didn't get N flowers but the prof did and N was parading them around so happy and it was a reminder of their connection. I guess N and the prof exchanged these flowers for every special occasion like birthdays etc.\n\nSo now she wants to get a decent sized tattoo in a highly visible spot of something that will remind everyone of the prof. I told N that this seemed really cruel to my mom who already feels cast aside and like she's in exile from N. And that's without the constant permanent reminder. N kind of scoffed and said \"I can't believe you think you have the right to tell me not to do this,\" called me an ass and hung up and is still not talking to me except for a very brief text saying congrats for a promotion I just got. My parents aren't commenting. My dad said I should have just kept quiet even though he agrees and my mom made no comment but seemed grateful I stood up for her.

Its a beautiful tattoo idea to remember someone she really cared about", "YTA. If you don't know why your sister has a strained relationship with your parents with your age gap then I don't know what to tell you.

The fact that your mother hasn't told you why their relationship is broken to such a degree is because she knows its entirely her fault.

Your sister is grieving and confiding in you, possibly the family member she's closest to, about her plans to cover a painful scar with something to help her heart heal... and all you can do is think of your mom's feelings?

It would hurt me, but I'd want her to he happy more than I'd want to protect my own feelings. That's kinda the bare minimum for motherhood.\n\nIf your mom is making things like graduation flowers about herself, you're probably right that she'll make your sister's tattoo about herself as well. Your sister's body and her grief have nothing to do with your mom. You overstepped and you should apologize.", "YTA it\u2019s not really any of yr business what your sis decides to do with her body, her tattoo idea sounds lovely, stop making it about yr mom", "There's more to this, I wanna know why she doesn't have a closer relationship with her parents.

You state in one of your comments that your mom abused pills and drank. Both you and your sister were in your teens before she got clean. You were children watching your parents, your mom especially, battle addiction. You may have forgiven your parents. N is not obligated to do the same. \n\nHer professor was a more stable source of support and maternal affection. As such, N will always have a connection with her.

All you do by jumping in is to ensure that she has another family member against her.\n\nAlso your entire argument is that your mother is jealous of her daughter\u2019s relationship with her professor.

She is ashamed of her failures and from your replies to other posts, she has good reason to be!\n\nWhen times where bad as a child and things got rough, I bet it wasn't your mum holding out their hand to help you out of it...

She never got to experience having an older sibling look out for her\u2026I\u2019m in my 40s and am still finding out things my sister experienced and her viewpoint.
