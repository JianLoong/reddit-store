They would do a lot together and worked closely on a few different writing projects.

I always thought she'd grow out of it or that the prof would move on but ten years later they were still very close. \n\nAbout a month ago the prof died unexpectedly and it devastated N. She was really dperessed over the holidays which of course was all in front of my mom and was a difficult reminder that N loved the prof as a mother way more than she ever loved my mom as a mother. She still talks to my parents and stuff and they don't fight or anything but N is very distant and doesn't tell them anything about her life beyond the bare minimum. My mom tried to comfort N but N was doing her distant thing and didn't want comfort. \n\nSomething unfortunate that happened to N is that when she got the call that she died, she was brewing tea and in the shock of the news she spilled boiling water on her arm which burned her kinda badly on her wrist. I think the burn was like on the borderline of 2nd and 3rd degree, and definitely still looked pretty rough during the holidays. N said it was especially hard because in addition to the physical pain, every time she looks at it she is reminded of the moment she found out the prof died. Which I totally get.\n\nI was on facetime with N and she said she talked to her tattoo artist friend who said that the burn should be able to heal well enough to get a tattoo over it. N then excitedly told me about her idea which is a type of flower that the prof gave her a bouquet of for her undergrad graduation. My mom was so embarrassed that day because she didn't get N flowers but the prof did and N was parading them around so happy and it was a reminder of their connection. I guess N and the prof exchanged these flowers for every special occasion like birthdays etc.\n\nSo now she wants to get a decent sized tattoo in a highly visible spot of something that will remind everyone of the prof. I told N that this seemed really cruel to my mom who already feels cast aside and like she's in exile from N. And that's without the constant permanent reminder. N kind of scoffed and said \"I can't believe you think you have the right to tell me not to do this,\" called me an ass and hung up and is still not talking to me except for a very brief text saying congrats for a promotion I just got.

Your sister wants to honor someone that was important to her and was there for her, would be different if she was just doing it to make your mom upset but she is not.", "YTA - Irrefutably so.\n\nYour mother is the one who destroyed their relationship and now she is merely reaping what she has sown. The fact that your mother hasn't told you why their relationship is broken to such a degree is because she knows its entirely her fault.

Your sister is grieving and confiding in you, possibly the family member she's closest to, about her plans to cover a painful scar with something to help her heart heal... and all you can do is think of your mom's feelings?

It would hurt me, but I'd want her to he happy more than I'd want to protect my own feelings. That's kinda the bare minimum for motherhood.\n\nIf your mom is making things like graduation flowers about herself, you're probably right that she'll make your sister's tattoo about herself as well. Your sister's body and her grief have nothing to do with your mom. You overstepped and you should apologize.", "YTA it\u2019s not really any of yr business what your sis decides to do with her body, her tattoo idea sounds lovely, stop making it about yr mom", "There's more to this, I wanna know why she doesn't have a closer relationship with her parents.

You were children watching your parents, your mom especially, battle addiction. You may have forgiven your parents. N is not obligated to do the same. \n\nHer professor was a more stable source of support and maternal affection. As such, N will always have a connection with her.

It\u2019s your moms own fault she never tried to connect to her own kid. So much that your sister was looking for a replacement. How come a professor is more appreciative of her student than her own mom? I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the only time your mom let your sister down. \nInstead of talking down on a person who actually looked after her daughter she should think about what she did wrong.

All you do by jumping in is to ensure that she has another family member against her.\n\nAlso your entire argument is that your mother is jealous of her daughter\u2019s relationship with her professor.

The only thing you really reference to that is how bad it made your mum feel to see how much more of an effect this woman had on her life than her own mother did... She is ashamed of her failures and from your replies to other posts, she has good reason to be!\n\nWhen times where bad as a child and things got rough, I bet it wasn't your mum holding out their hand to help you out of it... I bet it was your sister.", "YTA - you\u2019ve mentioned that your parents abused pills and alcohol until your sister was 14 and 17 respectively.

This makes you more of the AH with the reason known.

If you want to keep your sister in your life as more than an acquaintance it\u2019s time to take a step back.  You may be able to brush aside being raised by alcoholics and substance abusers but clearly your sister either cannot or will not. And as hard as it is to fathom a three year age difference means you had two different parents.  You won\u2019t know everything your sister has been through just like she won\u2019t know everything you have.  She never got to live with the sober parents, only you did. She never got to experience having an older sibling look out for her\u2026I\u2019m in my 40s and am still finding out things my sister experienced and her viewpoint.

The best anyone can glean from the limited facts you have presented is that your mother feels threatened by N's relationship with her mentor.

I don't think you have any right to pass judgement on the situation at all when you don't have all or even half the story. At best, it's just N and your mother have little in common, at worst, your mother could have done something to cause the rift. Regardless, she has no right to be upset. N is allowed to form close bonds with women who aren't your mom, to grieve, and to memorialize her friendships however she pleases, and if your mom doesn't like it or feels threatened, she needs to explore why their relationship isn't close and try to fix things or figure out how to come to terms with it.

Your sister has every right to have had this parental relationship with her professor and every right to mourn how she sees fit. Your mom needs to stop moping around about how sad it is she and your sister aren\u2019t close and accept that actions and addictions have consequences, no matter how sorry you are for them you don\u2019t get to dictate how someone else chooses to heal from the trauma you caused them.\n\nAs always I recommended therapy for all parties because it\u2019s an excellent tool.", "YTA.

Your sister is mourning someone dear to her. Your mom is jealous that your sister has made other, possibly more meaningful connections. If your mom wants the kind of relationship with her daughter that she made with her professor, it is her responsibility to seek her out and try to build that relationship. \n\nAnd even if your mom and sister became best friends tomorrow, it would still be okay for your sister to get a tattoo for her prof\u2026 because it has absolutely nothing to do with your mom.", "To paraphrase your sibling:\n\nI can't believe you think you have the right to tell her not to do this.

That distance sounds like a tool to keep from allowing your parents to hurt her like they've done in the past in whatever way they very likely did. \n\nAnd after all that turmoil and hurt from your parents, she got lucky to find someone to take up that role for her in the way she needed, and when that person she cared so deeply for passes and your sister is grieving, her \"mom\" makes it about herself. She sounds like a narcissist tbh. She couldn't even be bothered to get her only daughter flowers on her graduation day but your sister should be the one to bend over backwards to protect your mom from the way her own failures make her feel??

I'm not saying your mom is like that, but I am saying there are probably many things you don't know about your sister's relationship with your mom and it's probably not the same kind of relationship that you have.

You and your sister needed different things from your parents during that time and they did fail you both but you have to acknowledge that this time for a child is seriously important to their growth as they are experiencing puberty, hs, and thinking about adulthood. For your relationship with your sister, you need to stop being an advocate for your parents. She has some valid feelings for being withdrawn and while their recovery is amazing, your sister need to forgive and bridge the gap herself because only she can truly measure when she is comfortable with it. You sister has a right to have anything she wants on her body and your mother is a grown woman, she should respect and thank the professor for guiding and showing this unconditional love to her daughter when she was uncomfortable showing that to them.

Seeing your sister having the relationship she should of had with her with another adult hurts her ego and for your children you should put ego aside to make them happy.  \nThis is about your sister, not your Mum and you should stay out of it.

She ordered a strand for me then asked me what I thought of the pearls a news anchor on TV was wearing. Those pearls were longer and looked matronly.
