Natalie told me this minutes later and I couldn't help feel irritated and quite upset. I decided to get up and leave and we both left. I got calls from my family after they saw me leave. And Jordan called later and I told him why I did it. He got mad and said it was his wedding and that his aunt is basically a mother to him and said that Natalie shouldn't expect \"special treatment\". I said it's not special treatmrnt but a tradition. Besides that he hurt her feelings for no reason other than for the sake of being malicious. He got offended and accused me of ruining his day and causing a scene.\n\nNow the family sided with him and said I shouldn't have left nomatter what.", "created_utc": 1674918250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nh3tl/aita_for_leaving_my_sons_wedding_after_he_denied/", "score": 15095, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which is as under tradition what that dance is for. He was almost an adult when this all happened and so he's allowed to feel what he does. Ontop of that step mom just ruined her own relationship. Though now on to you. You just showed your own child how the step mom is more important than him, and how he feels. Don't be surprised now when you aren't told at all when his wife is pregnant.

You have basically undone years of work in a few minutes.\n\nEdit: added judgment", "YTA.\n\nThis is next level AH behavior.", "YTA\u2026I mean, I\u2019m really sorry for your loss, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re trying at all to see things from your son\u2019s side.", "YTA. He was almost an adult when she entered the picture so he should be forgiven for choosing an aunt who was a mother figure. Also, these are the types of things you practice, select a song etc. Did you gp to the wedding just expecting she would randomly have a mother son dance to any obscure song without discussing it first?", "YTA, and so is your wife. Sounds to me like she thought she had the right to be his Mom when he had already had one. And you did nothing to support your son as a teenager. The audacity of expecting to have a mother-son dance is truly beyond the pale. When your son goes NC, don\u2019t you dare act surprised.", "God YTA. he doesn\u2019t owe Natalie shit. Hope this worth losing your relationship with your son over.", "YTA. Your son did not pick your current wife, you did. You said yourself that they aren\u2019t close. There is no reason she would have this expectation at his wedding. This was his moment, not hers and you both showed your behinds.", "YTA.\n\nYour wife **ISN'T** his mother. So if that's what she's trying to be or what you've tried to make it then you need to knock it off. He was 16 when she came into his life, almost an adult, of course he doesn't see her in any way shape or form a mother figure, he's already a teenager at that point.\n\nI can only imagine why he distanced himself from her in the past, but now that he's older he's making an effort to move past that and be a bit friendlier with his *Father's wife*. That doesn't mean he accepts her as his mother figure? And it's a massive leap in judgement if that's what you both assumed.\n\nYou made yourself look like a fool and for what?", "YTA. It\u2019s not tradition to dance with your step mom. It\u2019s tradition to dance with the person who is a motherly figure. Your son chose his aunt. Is this aunt the sister of his mom? Seems like the closest thing to having his mom to dance with if it was", "YTA. It was your sons special day and you tried to make it all about your wife. You married her but she wasn't his mother, as you said so yourself. Why should he have a mother-son dance with a woman who is just his dads new wife. Yeah it might hurt and sure, she is your family, as well as he is. But you can't expect him to suddenly change his mind about a woman, who didn't rised him to call her 'mother'. They were on a better way, but obviosly you chosed again your new wife over your son \n\nIf your son means anything to you, appologize and hope he will forgive you for walking away from HIS special day.", "Tune in next month where OP wonders why his son went no contact after the wedding.\n\n(It's because you never respected any of the boundaries he tried to set and then just kept on with that pattern after the start of a reconciliation)\n\nYTA.", "YTA", "YTA - I think that\u2019s clear by now.  But, I\u2019d like to say that losing a wife is tough.  Finding someone new is a big deal, and I\u2019m sure that as an adult your son can appreciate that fact.  I don\u2019t think either you or your wife are terrible people, and neither is your son.  It was probably very tough for a 16 year old to accept that you had a new wife, which led to his pushing you both away, and now it\u2019s almost too late to change anything.  That all being said, storming out of your own son\u2019s wedding is childish.  We\u2019re all entitled to be so from time to time, but be prepared for the consequences of it. I hope you can repair the rift and grow from this, but it is entirely up to you to do so.", "YTA he gets to choose who is a mother figure to him after losing his own mom at a young age. You don\u2019t get to force him into thinking of your new wife as his new mom. And your wife should have also understood why he said no since you even said yourself he never considered her as his mom and moved in with his aunt.", "Yta, just because you wanted a new wife doesn't mean your son wanted a new mum you chose her he didn't and you both should've respected that, I'm guessing this is probably why he moved out to live with his aunt to get away from her because you both kept forcing it on him, their obviously not close so why would you expect him to do a mother/son dance with her, this is his wedding and dancing with his aunt was what he wanted especially as he can't have his mum there to dance with, it's not about you and your wife, do you not think this day was already hard on your son having to get married without his mum being there are you and your wife that self centered, what are you going to do if your son has kids and he doesn't want her to play the role of grandparent have a tantrum and leave.\n\nYour son's probably better of going no contact with you as it's obvious only yours and your wife's feelings matter.", "YTA, obviously", "Wow! YTA. I would be so surprised if anyone voted something different. I'm gonna scroll through the comments now...", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re forcing your son to view her as a mother and that\u2019s not going to happen.

You\u2019re acting delusional. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about whether or not your wife was kind. Even if she was, 16 simply isn\u2019t young enough to form that kind of bond. This isn\u2019t about tradition. This is about you being unable to see reality and behave accordingly.", "YTA. Your wife is not his mother, has never felt like a mother to him, never did the work raising him like a mother would and it's in no way tradition to have a step-mother / son dance. So you decided your son has to treat your wife as a mother despite all of this and you will punish him if he doesn't. What an asshole.\n\nWhy do so many men force their children to treat their new wives as their mothers even when they are fully grown when they cone into their lives? It's bizarre and very bad parenting. You've shown your son that you barely care about him and to do this at his wedding just is appalling.", "YTA. He has no obligation to consider Natalie his mother, especially since she didn\u2019t even become his step-mom until he was 16. It was completely his choice who to dance with, and he\u2019s probably going to resent both you and your wife now for leaving. Don\u2019t expect your relationship with your son to go back to normal too soon.", "Yta he never saw her as a mother figure and you should accept that. Doesn't mean he hates or disrespects her just take their relationship for what it is.", "Without a doubt, YTA", "YTA - At 16 he\u2019d have been too old to introduce a new Mum and I suspect being a teenager would still be dealing with his Mothers death. He\u2019s 27, and clearly respects your wife, but you have no right to force her on him as a replacement Mum and I can see how hurtful that might be for him.", "YTA \n\nYTA so damn much.", "God you\u2019re the asshole. To bad your son wasn\u2019t raised by an adult. When kids lose a parent they don\u2019t just get over it. I\u2019m sorry you were ok after three years but I\u2019m sure from experience even 14 years later it\u2019s raw to him. Just because you found someone doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll replace his mother. Thank god he has an aunt who he has connected to. You and stepmom should have never had expectations of anything at his wedding. It sounds like he hardly has any contact with  you anyway. You screwed this up big time and I don\u2019t know that you can fix it. But worse yet you can\u2019t get out of your own narcissistic head to realize you were wrong. Leave your son alone.", "WOW. YTA big time. I can't believe you have to ask this. Good you have a good relationship with your wife since she will be the only company you'll have when your kid goes NC.", "YTA. Natalie isn\u2019t his mother. Your son has made that clear. Instead of respecting your son\u2019s wishes and trying to foster a healthy relationship with no unrealistic expectations you have ensured that your son will never forgive you. And frankly you deserve it.", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t for \u2018no other reason\u2019\u2014it was because his aunt was like a mother to him while Natalie is his dad\u2019s wife.

First, you can\u2019t force this relationship on him. 2nd, you should be grateful that he had such a mother figure as his aunt in his life. 3rd, it\u2019s HIS wedding and HIS choice. Your son should go NC with such a horrible dad.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not like he was a small child when your wife came into his life.

A close aunt who\u2019s always been in his life and took him in when he couldn\u2019t handle his dad remarrying is a solid choice for mom son dance. And you simply needed to respect that. No matter how it might sting your, repeat your choice of a new family member. An adolescent has no responsibility to accept a new mom just because they are dad\u2019s new life partner.

So either this post is fake, or OP is so out of the loop of his son's life that he had no idea what the plans were and just expected to wing it? Or maybe there is a 3rd option, that he had been talking to the son about wanting the stepmother to have a mother/son dance, and the son refused, so they showed up at the wedding hoping they could guilt him into it?

I even messaged their mom to let them know that my only goal is to be a safe adult in their life that they can trust, because she was very worried and hated me at first when my boyfriend and I started dating.

The way OP worded it could easily indicate that it was his expectation that he was pushing for. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if your husband's stepmom did push back - if she did the right thing and set a nacho boundary, she would very much come across as cold.

His aunt took on the maternal role in his life, not Natalie, thus his aunt is the one who earned the privilege of standing in for his mom. As you call her \u201chis aunt\u201d, I\u2019m going to assume she\u2019s his mom\u2019s sister and not yours.
