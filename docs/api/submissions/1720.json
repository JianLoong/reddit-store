If his dad and him are not invested in making sure she's properly cared for - and that doesn't necessarily mean providing care themselves but it does mean having a caretaker rotation as opposed to sitting back and watching one woman burn herself out caring for another - then a home may be the safest and healthier place for her. The safest and healthier place for you is not where you are right now. The longer you wait the more typed you'll be the harder the fight will be. The longer his mom doesn't enter a home the worse off she'll be the harder it will be for her to provide feedback on the home (\"the food is good and they are very friendly and professional here\" vs \"I'm left in my bed all day and other residents are sitting in their own messes.\" And you can still take time to visit her, only now the logistical and mental strain of caretaking is gone and you can concentrate solely on being good company to get. \n\nSometimes life consists of choices where all you get is to choose the least sucky option all around.

Your BF says that you're \"paid\" to care for his mother.  Is that through the state/government?  I think it's called In home Supportive Services (IHSS) in many US states.  If this is the case, how many hours does BF's mother qualify for?  If she gets IHSS, then instead of you caring for her (for that pay), get an IHSS approved provider to care for her and LEAVE THE HOME WHEN THE IHSS PROVIDER ARRIVESL\n2. When does the BF's daughter come over?  Make sure that she doesn't arrive until your BF is home and when she does, LEAVE THE HOME with your daughter so your BF can take care of his mother and his daughter;\n3. If you want to, get a part-time job during the time that the IHSS provider is at the home and when your own daughter is in school;\n4. Make sure that the money you made from the sale in your home is never accessible to your BF.", "You know that taking care of kids and the homes is what a stay at home parent does.

His dad took over at about 7 or 8 at night to bathe her and do the more personal care. Even then, he barely took care of her. I also was in charge of childcare because my ex had a habit of running off to the bar or locking himself in his room and ignoring his mom and kid whenever she came to visit.\nNow, I'm not saying your boyfriend is like my ex.

He just doesn't want anything to change.  I'm a bit flabbergasted that he won't even help take care of his own mom.

I thought you said he moved in with her in the sense that he would take care of her. Was this a discussion he had with you before having you take over her care? And do you also take care of 2 children during the day as well? So you are not only responsible for HIS daughter and HIS mother, but your own daughter as well?\n\nI hope that the return for this amount of work is extremely worth it. Because I am a nanny of 2 kids and I make $30/hr and have health insurance and pto. And I would be charging extra for caring for an adult part time as well.

It's unfortunate that your children are seeing this relationship as normal, when a healthy relationship would be showing a lot more support from your husband. I really do hope that this post isn't indicative of how he is in your daily life. The selfishness is unbelievable. I dont know you, but you definitely deserve better. I hope you can someday see the value that you bring to this world, and stop catering to such a sad excuse for a husband. His mother is so lucky to have you, as is his daughter and yours!

You and husband need to have a proper discussion about exactly what it is he thinks you do all day and if perhaps it might be better for you to have a job outside the house and hire a full time/ part time carer for his mother. You are going to become more isolated and depressed if you aren't getting and break and proper fulfillment for life. You need to sort this OP.

I cooked. I cleaned. The family member of my husband who moved in with us was to the point where someone needed to clean her up after every accident. She no longer felt bowel movements and cleaning up those was a daily occurrence. I told my husband I wouldn't do it. The tension in our home was explosive. He didn't want to do it either but I flat out refused. It was me bringing her food, scrubbing her dogs pee out of the carpets, helping lift her into the and out of bed, trying to keep my 5 year old from jumping on her while relatives constantly asked me to talk to her or my husband about something.\n\nThe tension and stress wasn't alleviated until that family member passed away. It has taken months for my husband and I to feel love and respect towards each other without strings attached. \n\nI'm not saying this is your experience, but be careful. Listen to your gut.
