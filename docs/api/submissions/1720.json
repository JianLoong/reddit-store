If his dad and him are not invested in making sure she's properly cared for - and that doesn't necessarily mean providing care themselves but it does mean having a caretaker rotation as opposed to sitting back and watching one woman burn herself out caring for another - then a home may be the safest and healthier place for her. The safest and healthier place for you is not where you are right now. The longer you wait the more typed you'll be the harder the fight will be. The longer his mom doesn't enter a home the worse off she'll be the harder it will be for her to provide feedback on the home (\"the food is good and they are very friendly and professional here\" vs \"I'm left in my bed all day and other residents are sitting in their own messes.\" And you can still take time to visit her, only now the logistical and mental strain of caretaking is gone and you can concentrate solely on being good company to get. \n\nSometimes life consists of choices where all you get is to choose the least sucky option all around.

Your BF says that you're \"paid\" to care for his mother.  Is that through the state/government?  I think it's called In home Supportive Services (IHSS) in many US states.  If this is the case, how many hours does BF's mother qualify for?  If she gets IHSS, then instead of you caring for her (for that pay), get an IHSS approved provider to care for her and LEAVE THE HOME WHEN THE IHSS PROVIDER ARRIVESL\n2. When does the BF's daughter come over?  Make sure that she doesn't arrive until your BF is home and when she does, LEAVE THE HOME with your daughter so your BF can take care of his mother and his daughter;\n3. If you want to, get a part-time job during the time that the IHSS provider is at the home and when your own daughter is in school;\n4. Make sure that the money you made from the sale in your home is never accessible to your BF.", "You know that taking care of kids and the homes is what a stay at home parent does.

Your boyfriend is an asshole.", "Why don't you guys look into a Home Health company? Depending on where you live you might qualify for a Home Health aide at no cost out of pocket. In some states you could become her HHA and get paid for doing what you are already doing. I would either contact her doctor or directly the agency and they will work with you to help.", "NTA. oh gosh. Get the heck out of there. He needs to take permanent responsibility for his own mother and daughter. You don\u2019t deserve this nonsense. It\u2019s only going to get worse and worse as time goes on, as your responsibility increases and increases and his apathy and laziness drains all of your love away.", "Nta. You're still so young! Is this the life you want? Looking after all of his responsibilities? This sounds like hell to me. I would take my kid and move back home. Then get a job and never be dependent on someone ever again.", "NTA. It might be time to take your daughter and go visits friends/family for a weekend or 2 a month (when he has days off).", "NTA, but this doesn\u2019t sound like a wise situation for you. You are not making your own income. How can you support yourself and your daughter? You aren\u2019t married so you have no legal right to his income/assets. If you wish to continue being a caretaker for his mother and his daughter, he ought to be paying you.", "You already are in that trap and he really doesn't care. It's not fair to you. NTA", "I've got you in my trap said the spider to the fly.   Nta. Get out of there op. You can revisit going back if he starts helping with his mother and daughter. I bet once you are gone he figures out how to get the help he needs. If you do stay with him you get one full day off a week..", "You are falling into that trap. Get out as soon as you can. This is not okay. He doesn\u2019t even want to help clean or cook on days off. I cannot stress this enough:\n\nGet out of there ASAP. You are now his servant. He will not want that to change. He will limit your options to keep you there. Get. Out. \n\nNTA get out", "NTA, is this how you want the rest of your life to be?? Because if you stay this behavior will continue without a major wake-up call on his part. Maybe try counseling? \n\nI'm a SAHM too and when my husband has to take over completely he hates it. He always says \"I don't know how you can keep up\" he says going to work is easier lol. We both know if something ever happens to me he'd never make it, he admits it.", "NTA but you are one to yourself. Leave the bf and take care of yourself and your daughter. It may sound terrible but your mental health and well-being matter too. He\u2019s a boyfriend. Be glad you aren\u2019t married. You aren\u2019t trapped and you can pick up and leave without legal ramifications. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the answer you were looking for. Please consider cutting your loses when you are ready.", "Either the effort you are doing is work and you are also entitled to a break or it isn't work and so would be no effort for him to pick up when he's home.", "NTA, and seriously walk away. He's got you doing 4 jobs 24/7 for free (childcare x2, eldercare, full service maid for him) whilst he does a paid 9-5. That's not a relationship.\n\nHe's tried to trap you, don't let it stick. Take your daughter and go, you deserve more out of life.", "NTA. SAHP means you do all the work while he is working, then you and he share the work 50/50 when he is home. If he isn't willing to step up then you can easily drop a couple hundred pounds by getting rid of both him and his mother...", "If he won\u2019t take care of his mother, he\u2019s definitely not going to take care of you! On his days off get up pack your daughter go to the library or the park a friends, family members anywhere don\u2019t come home until bedtime. NTA", "he is with you so you can take care of her i suggest you take back control of your life ... start working again he can hire someone to take care of his mother", "At this point, you are basically living the life of a single mom...so you know you are strong enough to do it. And your load would be even lighter, because then he would HAVE to take care of his own mother.\n\nIt\u2019s disgusting that he is saddling you with literally everything, and make no mistake- he knows he is doing exactly that. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, you could do it without him and his dead weight. \n\nNTA. But your boyfriend is.", "NTA but you need to realise you are already in that trap you are speaking about. You are loving your mothers life but worse as you have another adult to look after as well as yourself and your husband. The next day he has off go somewhere just you and your child. Leave him to deal with the house for his days off. If this doesn\u2019t wake him up you have to make the decision if this is the life you want for yourself.", "THIS right here my friend.  Unfortunatley I see so many posts on AITA where the stay at home parent (usually a woman) is overwhelmed and asking if they are an asshole for requesting help from their working spouse and askig for a break from their never-ending work. OP you are NOT an asshole. The stress, anxiety, and work level have shot up for you since moving in, and even more ramped up with the departure of the aid. I doubt your husband's load has changed at all.  This is not an equal of effective partnership.

If you think things will change they won\u2019t. They will get substantial worse. He sees no issue in leaving you to take care of his kid and his mom and your kid.  Last I checked he made those kids. He doesn\u2019t get to clock out of parenting. \n\nYou are living in HIS moms house. Taking care of HIS mom, HIS daughter, and your daughter. You get no breaks he gets to sleep late.

Something will snap if something doesnt change. You. He needs to understand that unless he is willing to help, he will end up with the sole care of his responsibilities.\n\nAnd they are his.
