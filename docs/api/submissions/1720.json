If his dad and him are not invested in making sure she's properly cared for - and that doesn't necessarily mean providing care themselves but it does mean having a caretaker rotation as opposed to sitting back and watching one woman burn herself out caring for another - then a home may be the safest and healthier place for her. The safest and healthier place for you is not where you are right now. The longer you wait the more typed you'll be the harder the fight will be. The longer his mom doesn't enter a home the worse off she'll be the harder it will be for her to provide feedback on the home (\"the food is good and they are very friendly and professional here\" vs \"I'm left in my bed all day and other residents are sitting in their own messes.\" And you can still take time to visit her, only now the logistical and mental strain of caretaking is gone and you can concentrate solely on being good company to get. \n\nSometimes life consists of choices where all you get is to choose the least sucky option all around.

Your BF says that you're \"paid\" to care for his mother.  Is that through the state/government?  I think it's called In home Supportive Services (IHSS) in many US states.  If this is the case, how many hours does BF's mother qualify for?  If she gets IHSS, then instead of you caring for her (for that pay), get an IHSS approved provider to care for her and LEAVE THE HOME WHEN THE IHSS PROVIDER ARRIVESL\n2. When does the BF's daughter come over?  Make sure that she doesn't arrive until your BF is home and when she does, LEAVE THE HOME with your daughter so your BF can take care of his mother and his daughter;\n3. If you want to, get a part-time job during the time that the IHSS provider is at the home and when your own daughter is in school;\n4. Make sure that the money you made from the sale in your home is never accessible to your BF.", "You know that taking care of kids and the homes is what a stay at home parent does.

His dad took over at about 7 or 8 at night to bathe her and do the more personal care. Even then, he barely took care of her. I also was in charge of childcare because my ex had a habit of running off to the bar or locking himself in his room and ignoring his mom and kid whenever she came to visit.\nNow, I'm not saying your boyfriend is like my ex.
