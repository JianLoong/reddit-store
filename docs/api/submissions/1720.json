Well I hate to say it, but you already have. But you don't have to stay in that trap. I'm guessing if your bf won't help with his mum, he isn't helping with his child.

YOU are taking care of HIS daughter, your daughter and HIS mother. Being a caretake for 2 kids and an adult is exhausting. \n\nThis exact situation caused my parents to separate for several months. My maternal grandmother got hurt and needed in home care for almost a year. It was all dumped on my mom (it's a long story, but grandma's kids could have helped, they just didn't want to). My mom had enough, gave them all a hellfire and brimstone speech one Sunday when they come to \"visit\" their mom and cooked a huge meal then tried to leave it all for my mom to clean and then packed up us kids and went to her mother's house.\n\nNTA. HE needs to help with his mom or I would walk out.", "Why would you do that for someone you\u2019re not even married to? You may not want to believe it, but what you\u2019ve told us says exactly that.", "It is. It\u2019s really sad. It\u2019s a hard conversation to have too. I hope things go okay.", "At this point, you have two choices:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Ask him to switch for a day and give him a list of the things that need to be done. Ask him to just do one day to see how it is\n2. Or, do what he says, don't do anything on your day off but what you want to do. Give him the kids and his mom to take care of, let him cook and clean and do all the things you do. And tell him \"It's my day off, I don't want to do those things on my day off\"", "It basically is that way unfortunately. And you\u2019d be surprised. I\u2019ve tried saying he\u2019s solely responsible for his kid when she\u2019s here because she\u2019s a handful, very opposite from my kid. Doesn\u2019t work though since he\u2019s just upstairs on his computer most of the time", "Thank dog there's no ring on it, she'd be trapped. Since he's being so selfish, I think she could take her kid for a few days off so he'd learn how much work caring for a paraplegic can be on his own.\n\nAs it is, he's got a sweet deal, in home caregiver/nanny/ with benefits.", "She has both of those things yes. It\u2019s his dads house, he left her because he was done being responsible for her, that\u2019s how we got here. So the deal is that since it\u2019s his dads house and he made this decision, he pays the mortgage. Between us and his mom, we all take care of the other bills", "I don\u2019t. If I bring up plans, he just sighs and kinda rolls his eyes and dramatically says \u201cok\u201d because if I go somewhere, he\u2019s responsible", "I agree. Kinda makes me wonder if this was the same reason why his previous relationship ended.", "The first factor was the house market. I had a chance to make 40k off my house so I took that chance, I didn\u2019t want to live there more than 5-10 years anyway. Second reason, I just felt bad. I felt for her, I felt for my boyfriend. I hated his dad for it right along with him", "You need to get out of that house. He's using you and he's not going to stop.", "You need to even out your responsibilities.  If this means hiring someone so that that there is a little less, that's fine, but the load needs to be evened out. Its irrelevant about who's work brings in money. Work is work.", "I'm confused, you said you sold the house so she wouldn't have to go into a home but also you made money off your home? Is that money yours or did your money get spent on his mom?", "No, it\u2019s my money", "Okay, I'm glad to hear that. So you have some funds your can rely on if you need to walk away. Because honestly, based on your posts and responses...  I think you might need to walk away. It sucks but you deserve respect and cooperation from him and your getting neither and this is *his mom*. If his dad and him are not invested in making sure she's properly cared for - and that doesn't necessarily mean providing care themselves but it does mean having a caretaker rotation as opposed to sitting back and watching one woman burn herself out caring for another - then a home may be the safest and healthier place for her. The safest and healthier place for you is not where you are right now. The longer you wait the more typed you'll be the harder the fight will be. The longer his mom doesn't enter a home the worse off she'll be the harder it will be for her to provide feedback on the home (\"the food is good and they are very friendly and professional here\" vs \"I'm left in my bed all day and other residents are sitting in their own messes.\" And you can still take time to visit her, only now the logistical and mental strain of caretaking is gone and you can concentrate solely on being good company to get. \n\nSometimes life consists of choices where all you get is to choose the least sucky option all around. Unfortunately for you there are two men in this story who have added to the suckiness. But all you can control is how you can mitigate how much that suckiness eats of you."]}
