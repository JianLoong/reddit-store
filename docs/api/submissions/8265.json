My mother was never fond of my wife and made little of her a lot the way she dressed, the way she acted, her ethnicity (we are both white but my wife is Eastern European white so she has a tinted kind of white) she would also call over uninvited which annoyed us to no end. So about 6 months before we got married I told my wife we should get a cat\n\nWhy? She asked \n\nMy mom is allergic it would keep her away and give us more privacy\n\n\nThat\u2019s so evil but also I love it was her response \n\nSo we did some research looked around some shelters for a few weeks and found a year old cat which we adopted and named Tedder after my favourite singer (Ryan Tedder. Yes I\u2019m a Onerepublic fan sue me) it worked and she stayed away but kept complaining about it. \n\nWe then got pregnant and she gave birth 4 months ago to our son. It has annoyed my mother to no end that she can\u2019t drop in unannounced and she has to call and set up a time so we can put our cat out of the room and hit the furniture with a lint roller. My mother in law calls before she arrives and will even call a week or so ahead so as not to impose. \n\nWe had thought about getting another car for a while and decided to go for it so we adopted a kitten and named it Swift after my wife\u2019s favourite singer. My mother doesn\u2019t like this and says we only got cats to keep her away and that it is unsafe for our baby (he\u2019s not allergic we got him tested) because they are vicious. Our cats are fine they don\u2019t live together just yet as we are still in the introduction period for them. Tedder loves our son she watches him from atop our bookshelf and has never tried attacking him but we still supervise them both just in case. We aren\u2019t keeping my mom away for ever we only want her to give us notice like a day or so. There was another cat story I seen on this sub yesterday but I can\u2019t find it now about a roommates cat I never got to read it so apologies if they are similar \n\nBut Reddit are we assholes for getting and keeping cats\n\nEdit: We are taking good care of them they get cleaned out regularly have food and water and get let out for a run round our garden my wife loves to take Tedder into the office when she works because he loves to sleep on top of the filling cabinet and she says her purrs are therapeutic. Swift is still separated from Tedder by a baby gate cause we don\u2019t want Tedder to feel her territory is being invaded so we let them interact through it. We also swap their toys occasionally and their beds we plan to let them into the same room soon though\n\nWe don\u2019t plan to get anymore cats and we tried setting boundaries with my mother but she never listens we told her if she didn\u2019t stop that when our son was born she would get limited contact or no contact if she kept up she\u2019s currently on limited thanks to the cats. When it was just Tedder she would sneak around and scare her off having the second cat is not only good for Tedder but good for keeping her away we love them both \n\nApologies for no cat tax I\u2019ve asked my wife to send me some photos of them as all I have are my son my cows or my tractors I don\u2019t actually have any cat ones surprisingly", "created_utc": 1674667425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l42aw/aita_with_my_wife_for_getting_another_cat_when_we/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can entertain each other when you\u2019re busy with baby.

If you\u2019re trying to keep your mom away I think it\u2019s a win-win. She probably isn\u2019t deathly allergic to cats (very few are) she just wants things her way. Tell mom she needs to take an antihistamine when she comes over, she shouldn\u2019t be showing up unannounced anyways, and if she cares that much she can buy you some nice HEPA air filters to make her visits more comfortable.", "NTA\n\nou are doing a great job as a spouse, a parent and as a pet-owner!

Your baby, your wife, your cats.  It is not your bigoted mother.\n\nYour mother-in-law apparently has no problem with setting up visits in advance like any other reasonable adult, but your mother would clearly still be just barging in to be a nuisance belittling your wife.  She doesn't need that.  You guys especially don't need that around your child.  Enforce this.  Don't let her spew that crap or even make her little hints about it in front of your child, I don't care how young he is or how much he doesn't yet understand.\n\nIf she won't stop insulting your wife, you can just say no when she asks to come over.  If she comes over anyway, refuse her.  Once your cats are fully introduced and integrated, don't put them in another room unless she is *specifically* invited.  It's your cats' home and you only put them in a room very temporarily as a courtesy to guests who may be allergic.  Invited or welcomed guests.

The second cat doesn't actually affect your mother at all - a single cat which you already have means the house needs to be treated before she can visit.

It's effective, sure, but really cruel.

She might be your mother, but your wife and child are the most important things in the world to you and if she can't be respectful, I fully understand not allowing her in.

Seriously, you are giving two cats a loving home. And I absolutely loathe it when anyone drops by unannounced. It's bad manners in my opinion. You are NOT the asshole. Trust me on this.", "NTA but bro grow a back bone and stand up to your mom not passive aggressively", "Yeah, I'm with your wife, it's evil but I love it. You tried being reasonable and got nowhere, and now you have peace and quiet AND two lovely cats. You win. NTA", "If only my inlaws were allergic to DOGS... I had 3 of those when my son was born! I think it was a genius idea, and rescuing a second cat is hardly a deadly sin. Hopefully your cats get along after some time. NTA at all. <3", "NTA. Your cats are tiny, furry dragons that keep the troll away from your castle. LOL", "NTA. You mother doesn't pay your bills therefore it's none of her business.", "YTA- for not paying the cat tax. MIL needs to learn boundaries and is only upset because she no longer has free access to your space. Pets are often uses to guard against unwanted intruders, yours are just a little more gentle. It's not like she can never come over, she just has to do what is polite ans call ahead.\n\nOn a side note we have just gotten a little kitten too and my cat had gone from not having this, to fine I'll play with but I'm not happy to she just kicked me out of my bed and I don't what to do in a little under 3 weeks.", "I second the cow tax request. Cows are adorable.", "I think it was wholly unnecessary and really weird to include that description of your wife. NTA for the cat, but\u2026 definitely rethink how you describe people.", "I got really intrigued that OP somehow also had acquired a cow and then v excited for cow tax \ud83d\ude02", "Third on the cow tax. The motion has been carried. Cow tax is now due. (Seriously, I'm on an equine farm. I need cow pics)", "NTA\n\nCats and kids get along just fine.", "NTA and this is brilliant. In my experience, cats are by nature (lovable) assholes but are not \"vicious\" unless neglected or are met with the kind of negative energy I'm sure your mother oozes.", "NTA.  You are a genius.  Enjoy your kitties!", "My Ukrainian American self: *looks at phone, looks at skin, then repeats* What does that even mean? Is pasty white a tint?", "It's not really/always a visual thing, it's just the way racism works in Europe. To Northern and Western Europeans, Eastern and Southern Europeans are borderline/contingently white, kind of like white Jews in the US are to WASPS. To most people on the outside, that's just another white person. Within the whitest end of that culture though, there's always going to be something lesser or \"exotic\" or \"too loud\" or whatever it is about the same person. (This used to be true in the US too re: S and E Europeans, just not so much anymore.) Someone could look indistinguishable from a Swede or a German and still be perceived as \"less white\" if they have a Slavic accent or last name.", ">We are taking good care of them they get cleaned out regularly\n\nOk, THIS might make a cat attack people lol. I'm certain you meant the litter boxes but the way you phrased this is hilarious.", "At least you know your mother is a monster. Nothing worse than a partner in the FOG.", "If OP doesn\u2019t provide I will pay cow tax to show you a different cow \ud83d\ude02", "/r/happycowgifs is always a lovely place for cute cows!", "I didn't know about this. Thank you!", "Bless, thank you for this", "You're welcome! It always brightens my day :)", "My pleasure! I hope it brings you lots of joy :)"]}
