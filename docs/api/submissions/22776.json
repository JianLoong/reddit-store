I did not ever give you an open invitation. Understand that I can be liable if someone gets hurt or dies in my pool. I need to be home and you need to ask or be invited. Any reasonable person should know it is not ok to just invite yourself into someone's personal space. Because your family went into my pool I had to redo the chemicals, hence the smell. That is on you. Also I had to spend $100 on this, which I am not asking you for but I am asking you to understand that this is not okay. It's not neighborly. If this is a problem then understand there will be no more invites to my pool at all.\" Try it", "I've had a pool for 20 years and never ever had this kind of chemical smell. I had algae because the pool guy skipped a week without saying anything and florida had very hot days with a lot of rain. The next week it was addressed.  \n\nA friend did this kind of treatment to her pool and because she over chlorinated it she had problems for weeks afterwards.  Call an expert and get it fixed professionally.   It should not take that many chemicals. . \n\nPeople using a pool if the filter is running should not create this kind of issue in so short a time.   There's likely something else going on.", "Time to cut them off.", "You need to rescind their access. NTA.", "Rescind it in writing as well or record the conversation to make it official.", "Also impossible on many pools and a fortune", "I had that last year. I had the water tested and there was something else I had to use in addition to the shock. I forget what it was, but it was the only thing that made the shock work. Other pool owners may know what it is. \n\nGo get the water tested.", "Dude they didn\u2019t cause an algae bloom and they sure as shit didn\u2019t fuck your levels up that bad.  People don\u2019t lower your CYA\n\nBut that said don\u2019t let them swim anymore"]}
