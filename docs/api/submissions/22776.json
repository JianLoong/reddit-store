Evidence is your friend in this case. \n\nFor a more technical explanation, she\u2019s cripplingly insecure about herself, and a defence mechanism therefrom is projection.

If anything ever goes legal that sign could save you a lot of grief. \n\nMake it clear to them that if you DO allow them into your pool ever again that it is not a free pass to use your pool whenever they want for forever.

It might be better to eat the cost, and not let them come over for a long time, or ever.", "I suggest a higher fence with a lock. That's a liability if anyone gets in and gets hurt or worse.

It actually helps to have people in the pool running, moving the water, and best if they run filter while you are away. If there is rain, that will mess up your chemical balances while you are away.\n\nExample, our pool was beautiful clear when we went away for 4th of July. No friends wanted to use the pool and we had a bunch of rain. Got home 6 days later to a green pool. Schocked the pool, normal due to the rain, adedd algea killer, normal with so much rain, added ph up and clear...all because of the rain we had. \n\nI think your anger is misplaced.", "Nta. They should ask each & every time they use your pool. Rather its for legal protection or just for the heads up or for privacy. As a pool owner, i would be livid. Good luck, hope the shock works. I had to spend $371 a couple yrs ago when mine went belly up.", "Nta. Get some security cameras next time", "Take away their permission.", "NTA. Send them an invoice and an explanation for what went wrong and how it's their fault. They'll shut up about the smell complaints.

Also let them know not to use your pool when you go away so they don't have to complain about this smell again.", "NTA\nHowever I would get cameras and gate locks installed. Should something happen to them or any guests they have at your pool,then they can sue you. \n\nYou said they were allowed, while you were at home.

If there was a lot of rain while you wrre gone, their use had nothing to do with it, in fact water movement lessons algae growth, so your anger is misplaced. All the above sounds normal for a pool in the Midwest these past few weeks.\n\nA robot pool cleaner helps, but it can't add chemicals when there is rain", "They're using your pool in place of bathing their kids during the summer, that's why it got cloudy and gross.\n\n\nGross people do that because they're lazy and nasty.\n\n\nNTA.", "Locking pool cover. Bonus: will keep the water much cleaner and prevent evaporation", "Your neighbors are not the issue for the chemical issues. Are you using chlorine stabilzer and what was the weather while you were gone? If it rained, that will easily mess up your chemical balance and them using the pool actually made the issue less because use means water movement which means less algae growth. Source, habe a pool and let trusted friends use it to avoid such issues.\n\nYou like the husband, teach him to help while you are gone. They use the pool and help keep it clean. Fyi, to all those claiming liability.....I said trusted friends and  if they accept to help for use, you are ok.", "I came here to say just that. \n\nOP, please tell them they cannot use your pool anymore. They clearly took advantage of you and your kindness. They have shown to be entitled, rude, and selfish.\n\nYou also need to protect yourself. If anything should happen, you could be held liable. Worst case scenario would be someone drowns; they can actually sue you. Say someone is swimming in your pool, they somehow hit their head and lose consciousness...The family could legally come after you. Even if someone falls, on your property, and injures themselves they could try to hold you liable for that as well. \n\nEven tho you did not give them permission to use your pool while you were gone, they could try to say they thought it was an open invitation. So many things could've gone wrong. So many things can go wrong. The best thing to do is to just tell them the pool is now closed.", "Lol, NTA. besides it's a pool. it will smell sometimes.  Just tell them to GTO", "NTA\n\nStart locking your gates and outright tell them they can no longer use your pool. They're a literal liability and could have sued should something had happened to them or the people they had in the pool.

File a police report to get their trespassing on the record.", "NTA\n\nI know you want to maintain a friendly relationship with your neighbors, and I'm guessing you are still going to let them use it sometimes, but you NEED to set rules and boundaries and let them as well as your other neighbors know. \n\nThey need to let you know in advance and wait for you to approve, it is YOUR pool, not everyone's, only 4 adults max and no kids, if they mess up the chemicals again they need to help pay, things like this. You can apologize for the smell if you'd like, but tell them exactly why it smells like that and who is responsible. You can be a good neighbor and have rules, too. \n\nYou have the camera now. You need a no trespassing sign and even a gate for the other neighbors. If things get out of hand again, revoke rights and call cops for trespassing. It's your house, pool, property, and money. Don't let their annoyance be more important than all of that.", "NTA\u2026.put a fence up, lock said fence and put no trespassing signs and tell them they broke onto your property when you were not home, caused damage to your pool which cost x amount of dollars because they were in your pool and messed up the ph and then tell them you will not press charges for breaking and entering and trespassing onto your property if they pay you the money and agree never to enter your property without your permission moving forward. If you wanna be spiteful and they want to be major assholes take them to small claims court for the cost of the cameras, fence, locks, AND chemicals. \n\nDocument how you know they were in your pool. Hopefully it\u2019s video and if not then I hope your in a one party consent state because then you just need to have them recorded saying they swam in your pool, then take them to court and press charges if necessary.\n\nEdit add:\nIf they got hurt on your property and said you gave them permission to sw there you could and most likely would be sued for anyone injured on the property.", "Nta ur pool ur responsibility.   Tell them they can't use it anymore", "INFO: Why would you be an asshole for cleaning your pool", "It's time to put a lock on the pool gate.", "NTA.
