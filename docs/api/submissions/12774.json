It's good that she checked on you but her following comments and reporting you to the manager were way out of line and your coworkers see/saw that", "Is nobody gonna talk about how condescending and awful someone trying to protect you when youre not in danger is? I was messing around with my friend at a LARP (hes 6'4, Im 4'9) and he poked me with his prop cane a few times. Silly fun, nobody was offended. Except the person in charge of complaints about out of character stuff like that saw that and was so uncomfortable and offended on my behalf that next game she went on a 20 minute rant about touching people with props. I was furious and embarrassed and had to let my friend know I didn't make a complaint. Youre NTA and that coworker is.", "I think you need to talk to Lia and see if she is , or has been the target of sexual abuse.  An outsized reaction could be just her being a busybody, but also could be because she has trauma from being groped by managers/ customers. / family . \n\nNTA for not reporting an incident you feel was accidental. It is not ok for someone else to tell you how to feel about it. \n\nIt is ok to mention these things to management- not as an assault, but as a please note. That way IF, the rare case the behavior gets weird, or he does it to someone else : it establishes a pattern of behavior.", "NTA but I had to comment on your weight. I don\u2019t mean to assume anything but I\u2019m also 5\u20192\u201d and I weigh 93 pounds. I\u2019ve lost around 10-15 pounds in the last two years and occasionally fall down to 85.  That\u2019s all due to struggling with anxiety and depression which makes it incredibly difficult for me to eat because most the time I\u2019m not even hungry. It causes headaches and dizzy spells and it gets worse the lighter I am.", "NTA. The metoo bullshit is going too far. She wanted the man fired and labelled a sexualising predator for an accident?

Please take care of yourself.", "ESH\n\nLia seems like the type to look for issues or drama, only because she switched her attention to reporting you when you didn't want to go along with reporting Jack.\n\nYou are an AH for being unprofessional. You don't have to like every coworker, and if someone is acting inappropriately or threatening you, just go to HR or management. Cursing and then later screaming at her is, in fact, creating a hostile workplace, regardless of whether you think she deserves it. \n\nNo one else there wants to deal with you and Lia's drama. Yes, Lia sounds obnoxious, but you are going to work with lots of obnoxious and way worse people in your life. You can't yell and curse them all out. You'll have to learn how to handle situations like these more professionally if you want to keep jobs in the future.", "Unpopular opinion probably but I\u2019m going to say a very soft NAH to a point, but hear me out\u2026\n>\nMost people ignore (or worse!) sexual harassment in the workplace. Most people don\u2019t want to put their neck on the line for themselves, let alone a co-worker, especially against a supervisor. So the fact that Lisa DID notice and she did pull you aside to make sure you are okay, is fantastic!!\n>\nHowever she quickly became the AH when she did not hear you and she actually accused you of dating the manager. My guess is that she\u2019s dealt with sexual harassment (maybe even sexual assault) in the workplace and overreacted in this particular case. My judgment went from NAH to NTA because she didn\u2019t hear you out.", " NTA.", "nta", "NTA.

She was trying to take agency away from you and control the situation to her liking. \n\nLooking out for you would have been asking if you were alright and offering support if you wanted to talk or make a report.

Telling someone they\u2019ve been abused and insisting they report a situation is effed up.

I wouldn\u2019t have told her to \u201cgo fuck herself.\u201d That\u2019s immature. You could have politely walked away.

Nobody asked.", "> Cursing and then later screaming at her is, in fact, creating a hostile workplace, regardless of whether you think she deserves it. \n\nTwo things.\n\n1. When someone is blowing up in your face and shouting at you and making up lies and threatening to drag you into wholly-invented HR drama, it is very very reasonable to tell them to mind their own business. I get that there's a procedure for everything, gotta act professional, all that, but when the rubber hits the road and someone's in your face, \"fuck off\" is pretty normal.\n\n2. Hostile workplace means something very specific, and this isn't even close to it.", "I understand your first part well. I was grateful that she made sure I was okay. I thanked her and then defended him. But her comments following that were what pissed me off, tbh.", "Too bad. It's not normal for a woman to weigh as much as a 10-year old. It's alarming.\n\nThere is no \"ew.\" My point was my daughter is really small and weighs more than a woman taller than her.", "You can try and justify it because how the other employee acted first, but at the end of the day, she is now also yelling back at her and then randomly yelling at her later in front of another coworker. \nNow they have both engaged in toxic behavior, regardless of who did it first or if one was done in response to the other. I guarantee employers will not care who started it either if they both are being disruptive at work. She could face the chance of being terminated as well. \n\nI am not say what Lia did was ok, but all OP did was sink to her level and gave the woman exactly what she wanted, which was drama. Furthermore, OP yelling at Lia was witnessed by another coworker who called OP an AH. I'm guessing no one witnessed Lia blow up at Op because it was done more privately. Now OP looks worse to coworkers for reacting, and Lia can hide her behavior as well.\n\nI get it, truly. We all have day dreams of telling off a shit coworker. Saying flip off to a coworker/boss you dislike makes for great television, movies, and internet stories. In real life, it just gets you fired.", "Agreed", "You know nothing about this woman and any health issues she does it doesn't have. Coming here and commenting on a woman's body like you are an expert when you literally know nothing else about her is gross", "Unless I'm missing something (and I read it a few times), OP only talks about one blowup, the one where Lia got all in OP's face and OP shut her down and told her to fuck off. Lia then tried to escalate it, manager didn't care, and word got around, and Lia's now being shunned.\n\nI don't see any of that other stuff you're talking about. \n\n> she is now also yelling back at her and then randomly yelling at her later in front of another coworker. \n\nWhat? When? There was one incident.\n\n>  all OP did was sink to her level and gave the woman exactly what she wanted, which was drama.\n\nWhen? How? Word got around, OP doesn't say she fed drama at all. Other colleagues gossiped, but unless OP was supposed to just stay quiet and get screamed at, when did she feed drama?\n\n> Furthermore, OP yelling at Lia was witnessed by another coworker who called OP an AH.\n\nUnless I'm blind, that's nowhere in the post. That's made up.\n\nAs reported: OP did one telling-off to someone who was in her face trying to make up an issue where there was none.", "Idk post must have been edited after my initial response. The part about the manager knowing is new, and the second incident where OP yelled at Lia \"for looking at her\" was taken out. Can't help when OP changes stuff later. \n\nEither way, I stand by my initial statement regardless of whether people agree or downvote it.The second OP engaged in yelling and cursing she became an AH too. That's not how adults handle issues at work. Firmly tell the person to stop, walk away, get a supervisor, write down and/or record what was said, and file complaints. Yelling back solves nothing and makes you look bad as well. If I witnessed this at my workplace, I would avoid both of these women.", "sorry but I never edited my post tho. what are u even saying? i blew up on her once and no one witnessed it. word got around after she mentioned it to our manager and i also just found out that she was hostile towards Jack too and said something to him. i don\u2019t exactly know what she said. so he must\u2019ve said something to others. i didn\u2019t go around shitting on her to my other coworkers cause it\u2019s no one\u2019s business except mine and maybe Jack. the person who called me the AH is my friend (she doesn\u2019t work there). i asked her opinion on this incident. thats it. stop trying to add in new stuff and read the post properly. thank you! \n\np.s: i\u2019m going to edit the post NOW because i realised i misspelled his name on the 3rd paragraph. that\u2019s it. i\u2019m not editing anything else"]}
