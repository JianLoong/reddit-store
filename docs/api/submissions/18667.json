You may want to reflect on who carries the mental load cause most men have no concept of how taxing it is to keep track of everything, organise everyone and make sure no important balls get dropped. It's very common for women to be labelled as depressed when they're actually just completely overwhelmed and under supported. \n\nIf you want to genuinely figure out if there's disparity in the physical and mental load you each carry for the family, including your employment, there's a card deck, book and documentary for the fair play method that would help you both to understand the current split of responsibilities. Every time I've seen it done, the man has realised just how much more his partner is carrying than him. If that's the case here, her reactions are likely driven by feeling overall unsupported and neglected, which is poison to your relationship. The fact that she's already thought about and voiced that her life wouldn't be significantly harder as a single parent suggests that she's thought about this a lot and feels there's a significant disparity. She's unhappy and she will eventually leave if you don't come to the table to address her concerns. \n\nFor the specific situation you've laid out here you're NTA but I have a strong suspicion that you've only included details that make you look good and her version of the story would be very different. Everyone else's opinions aren't going to change that you'll be single if you don't genuinely listen to her and address her concerns. You might suddenly realise just how much she was taking care of for you when she's no longer there holding everything together for you. Or maybe she's actually an AH and you'll be happier single. Either way, this is a much bigger issue than whether or not you made yourself available to help her instead of going to the bathroom, especially when you knew she would want that and be upset if you didn't but still chose to stay in the bathroom when you saw her coming.

Yes we do", "My IBS disagrees. I do eat fiber, take a probiotic, have seen doctors, and have gone through multiple tests and spent a lot of money trying to figure it out what was wrong. Untimely, IBS and what triggers it seems to vary from day to day. I have yet to find a doctor that\u2019s overly concerned.", "I\u2019m surprised how many people here are judging someone else\u2019s poop timeline \ud83d\ude02 even my son takes forever to poop and he\u2019s a super healthy kid who I force lots of veggies and water upon. The amount of time I\u2019ve waited for him in public restrooms\u2026. Just insane haha", "I got curious and Googled it - doctors say it should take between 10 seconds and 1 minute.

Because policing someone else\u2019s bodily functions is abuse, and he has to keep the bathroom door open when he shits in case she wants to talk to him.
