She told me that she wasn\u2019t home (30 mins away) but that she was gonna pick up our dog from her parents\u2019 house and she would either let our son play there for a bit or just leave him there and head home. She essentially said \u201cdon\u2019t expect me to be there as soon as you get home.\u201d\n\nI get home from work in a suit and it\u2019s hot outside so all I\u2019m thinking about is taking off the suit and using the restroom. I do that and as I\u2019m sitting on the toilet I check her location and see that she\u2019s like 6 mins away. I\u2019m thinking \u201cfuck, she\u2019s gonna get upset because she needs my help getting inside the house with our dog or something.\u201d I was shocked to see her get home 10 mins after I got home, not only that, our son was also with her, pretty much contradicting what she said earlier. I texted her \u201csorry I\u2019m in the restroom rn\u201d when I saw her parked outside. When I get downstairs she was pissed that me using the restroom was \u201cmore of an urgency\u201d than helping her get the kids inside the house. She said that I knew she was coming so she was surprised I didn\u2019t wait, but in reality I wasn\u2019t expecting her soon! She also said that this reminds her more and more that she\u2019s able to be a single parent and doesn\u2019t need my help.\n\nEdit: After seeing some comments I\u2019m going to provide some more info. When I say our kids I\u2019m referring to our son and our dog because we see our dog as our child.\n\nOur son has no disabilities and neither does our dog. Our son and dog are both 3 years old. She has not complained about having to take the kids in an out of the car, this only occurs when I\u2019m at the house.\n\nI am typically outside when she pulls up to the driveway. There\u2019s only been 2 times in the past 11 months of living in our new house where I haven\u2019t been available to go outside and help her. I am also very helpful around the house and with the kids.\n\nI don\u2019t spend an insane time in the restroom, typically 10-15 mins and I leave the door open in case my fianc\u00e9 needs to tell me something. I don\u2019t mind leaving the door open at all.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has been diagnosed with MDD in the past  and likely has other disorders but she has not gone to therapy due to lack of insurance. However, I will work on getting her the help she needs ASAP despite the lack of insurance. She was fine when I went back upstairs with our son after 30 mins or so. I am glad she acknowledges that she has problems and is willing to go to therapy.\n\nHere is a better defined timeline:\n\n7:30 - I arrive home\n7:36 - I sit on the toilet, check my fianc\u00e9\u2019s location and see that she\u2019s nearby\n7:43 - she arrives home\n7:47 - I head downstairs to see everybody inside the house and fianc\u00e9 upset at me", "created_utc": 1685582427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x4bsu/aita_for_not_waiting_to_use_the_restroom_until_my/", "score": 3063, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very common for women to be labelled as depressed when they're actually just completely overwhelmed and under supported. \n\nIf you want to genuinely figure out if there's disparity in the physical and mental load you each carry for the family, including your employment, there's a card deck, book and documentary for the fair play method that would help you both to understand the current split of responsibilities. Every time I've seen it done, the man has realised just how much more his partner is carrying than him. If that's the case here, her reactions are likely driven by feeling overall unsupported and neglected, which is poison to your relationship. The fact that she's already thought about and voiced that her life wouldn't be significantly harder as a single parent suggests that she's thought about this a lot and feels there's a significant disparity. She's unhappy and she will eventually leave if you don't come to the table to address her concerns. \n\nFor the specific situation you've laid out here you're NTA but I have a strong suspicion that you've only included details that make you look good and her version of the story would be very different.

You might suddenly realise just how much she was taking care of for you when she's no longer there holding everything together for you. Or maybe she's actually an AH and you'll be happier single. Either way, this is a much bigger issue than whether or not you made yourself available to help her instead of going to the bathroom, especially when you knew she would want that and be upset if you didn't but still chose to stay in the bathroom when you saw her coming.

She will probably even be pissed at him if anyone points out that she's abusive.", "Yeah, it's pretty abusive to be talking to him that way. Pretty much like angrily saying \"if you don't jump through hoops to please me then as a punishment I will throw you out like a piece of trash.\"\n\nShe probably keeps him on the edge of insecurity/security (while also blaming him) so she can control him, but sadly this will do a lot of damage to him.", "The door is always closed for poops.

Sounds like she is pretty controlling.", "According to my informal poll, people who take that long in the bathroom (mostly men for some reason) cited privacy and alone time as the reason lol", "And it generally ends up being carbon monoxide poisoning.
