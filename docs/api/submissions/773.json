It really is just depending on how your fianc\u00e9 views it. They might care, they might not, hell they might love it. Who knows? But you have started a relationship on a lie, and that's not a good thing for trust. I'd recommend coming clean, it's better in the long run for everyone involved.", "imo this is weird and I think YTA. you might think it\u2019s a little white lie but it\u2019s really not- you kind of stalked and planned your encounter in order to start a relationship. it doesn\u2019t seem like the most authentic. idk, personally, if it were me in his place, I would be questioning things. it seems so late to mention this right before a wedding.", "I don't think he'll care as much as you think. NAH, IMO as long as you didn't use info from his socials to get him to like you (if so, my opinion would change)", "NTA. You happened to see him online and happened to run into him at Walmart so you told a little white lie to meet him. If you were actually stalking and followed him to Walmart, that would be very weird, or had moved to Arizona to meet him (which would be very alarming), then you would be TA. But I don\u2019t think there was any harm in making up a little fib to be able to talk to him. It seems no different than a pick up line to me. Or if you worked with him, making up a fake reason to introduce yourself. Considering it has been 4 years and assuming you\u2019ve been your true self with him, I wouldn\u2019t be stressed about it. Be happy that it worked out.", "YTA for stalking.\n\n... if you have moved past this behavior and really love him and he loves you,  don't speak a word of this to him.   You can have secrets in a good relationship.", "This is pretty creepy stalker behavior and would be red flags for me. I would rethink the entire relationship.
