The problem is, she's also not an AH for being clear that she won't lie to her spouse. At least she's telling you up front and giving you the opportunity to decide how you want to proceed.\n\nSeparately, you might want to plan a vacation to sunny Mystic, CT soon.

You don\u2019t want him to know something private that could cause you harm and that\u2019s valid also.

You could still go and tell her that you needed this time away from your state to think about what to do.  She can tell her husband that you are having a personal crises and need a change of scenery to think about what to do,\n\nIf you decide to go through with it, don't tell your cousin unless it is absolutely necessary.

You can come up with some reason you need a hotel like you've got a project you need to work late on or you snore or....", "In a case like this where you could face jail for a routine medical procedure (which still really is just terrible and frustrating), I would say NTA though I also understand where she's coming from, not wanting to lie to her husband. Is there any way she can remind hubby of the risk to you if it gets out, I don't know if he is going to \"get it\" but maybe? I hope everything goes well for you.", "NAH.  I understand completely why you would want to keep this private, given the political climate in some states.  I also understand someone not wanting to directly lie to their spouse.  She's being respectful and giving you a heads up that things have changed, and letting you know her boundaries.  I suggest staying in a hotel while there.", "\"I don't think she is really thinking of the consequences for me.\"  \n\n\nMaybe she is thinking of possible consequences for themselves. If it would get you in legal trouble, would it not also get *them* in legal trouble for aiding you?

If my husband's cousin or sister came to stay with us for an abortion, and I wasn't at least informed it was for a confidential healthcare reason, I would be wondering what the hell I was doing wasting my time in a marriage where my husband felt he couldn't trust me. \n\nAs everyone else is saying, you should stay in a hotel. That way can keep your confidentiality. Husband won't have to know and you aren't unintentionally getting involved in their marriage. Fyi I had an abortion 10 years ago.
