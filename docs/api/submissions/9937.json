If you\u2019re in a homosexual relationship having a child that is biologically both yours is impossible. It\u2019s also stupid on their part to try and ignore his biology bc biological parentage is important for a lot of medical issues and knowing whether he is more likely to have cancer/diabetes and many hereditary medical conditions. One day they may need to know for a fact who the bio dad is for that very reason in an emergency.( Ex: An accident where blood needs to be donated will be faster if the bio parent has the same blood type and they don\u2019t have to do tests for blood typing) I\u2019m sorry it hurts his feelings but asking everyone to tip toe around biological facts to make his husband feel better is overkill. If his husband feels so othered then they should use his sperm for the next kid not expect everyone around them not to say anything that might insinuate your brother is in fact the biological dad. Does he think everyone who sees them doesn\u2019t know who bio dad is? If his husband is this triggered by it he might need therapy to work through it but just pretending it doesn\u2019t exist isn\u2019t good. What are they going to do when that child starts comparing themselves to bio dad? Tell them to be quite bc it hurts other daddies feelings. And the kid will do that some day. They\u2019ll hear a friends parents say oh he/she has my eyes/ ears/ etc and wonder if they have those traits in common with their own parents. Kids simply do that, they ask questions and wonder why things are the way they are.  I did it when I was little (moms green eyes), my nephews done that, and I work with tons of kids who are always telling me how things they do or how they look are like mommy/daddy.

Both look stunningly like each of us, respectively, but SO OFTEN, a mutual friend of us and the donor will declare our kids to look like the donor. It shouldn't hurt my soul the way it does. I am incredibly grateful for his incredible investment in my family (so much so if I think too hard on it, I WILL cry), and yet as a queer person, issues of genetics and family and kids and lookalikes is more fraught than most will realize, especially heterosexual people able to create families with their partner. \n\nMy bestfriend just carried two embryos-- one hers and one her wife's-- from an anonymous donor, and both babies were born and both are mini mes.

It's hard to not do it. \n\nOP, I am going to go with NTA *in this exact instance*.

They do have an older girl who I feel is likely the husbands, but he is bitter over the past so they decided not to tell us anything anymore. It's all a big misunderstanding, our mother was confused how they could be still deciding who's sperm they would use after they'd settled on the husband's sister being the surrogate. We tried a few times to explain egg donors vs surrogates to her, but never seemed to stick, and she needed up asking if they used the husband's sperm wouldn't the baby be \"dirty\" (meaning an incest baby). Again, I tried to explain if the egg donor was not related then it doesn't matter which of them is the father, but she can't seem to separate carrying a child with being the mother of the child. She also asked a few times if the baby would look like my brother or if the baby would have the husbands darker skin, so I think that all got confused and mixed up with the dirty/incest comment. But those girls will absolutely compare themselves with whichever if their father, they already do it, but I can tell they're very confused. The youngest thinks she has her ringlet curls and freckles from my BIL's side, and her big ears from my brother. They let her think she's a blend of them, even though it's very obvious who her father is, and I'm not given permission to tell her she has her curly strawberry blond hair from the Irish in us.
