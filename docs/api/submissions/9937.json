Sounds like your brother and his husband \"don't know\" who's sperm was used (something a lot of gay couples do)? Then yes, commenting on how your niece is genetically similar to your family is indeed a rude thing to do. It's not innocent. He and his husband don't have the chance to see their genes combined, like hetero parents get to. Many people will treat his husband like less of a father (even though he isn't, but they will).

Is that what's being \"speculated\", do they not officially know who the bio dad was?\n\nSo YTA for 1) repeatedly making those comments despite already knowing he doesn't like it, and 2) writing this post in a deliberately misleading way that glosses over what you know the conflict is actually about.", "INFO Wait. I\u2019m so confused. You say it\u2019s your cousins baby, but then say to your brother \u201chis daughter\u201d??? Whose kid is it?", "YTA\n\nI was gonna side with you until i got to the end...you left out the part that this is the child of a gay couple. Thus only one of their sperm was used. This makes it disrespectful to the husband when you comment only about your brothers genetic value in the child.", "YTA. This seems innocent but sounds like they\u2019re a gay couple and he\u2019s already told you his husband is sensitive about it.

It's obviously a point of contention for your brother and his partner, so if you already knew not to mention it, you shouldn't have. \n\nEven some straight couples don't like this.

Your brother made clear that his husband found that line of conversation hurtful, so you need to apologise to him for hirting his feelings and stop doing it.", "YTA.

In my opinion he has told you how he feels and what he wants/doesn\u2019t want when it comes to his daughter. You should do as he says. For that reason I will give YTA.
