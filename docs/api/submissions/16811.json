It's humiliating to be laid off, so why would they bring attention to it even if they really did prefer a cheaper place? Of course they would agree with everyone else. \n\nWhat pushed me over from NAH is the fact that you keep harping on everyone agreeing-- this shows very clearly that you really do lack empathy, as you apparently can't imagine a scenario in which someone would agree when they actually didn't feel that way.", "NTA.\n\nGiven a large enough group, somebody is always going through SOMETHING.  Getting laid off isn't always the same level of crisis for everyone.  Or maybe someone recently had a baby.  Or is getting married.  Or getting divorced.  Or their parents are having issues.  Or they're saving for vacation.  Or they just got back from vacation and now they're broke.  Or it's January and all the bills from Xmas shopping just came in.  Or it's February and still paying off the Xmas bills.  Or just bought a new water heater/dishwasher/washing machine/roof/car.  Gosh, how can you be so insensitive trying to pick a fancy restaurant when all that stuff is going on??!?!?\n\nMaybe if they just got laid off and money is tight, they shouldn't be going out to eat ANYWHERE.  Or, maybe they know how to budget and save and the next job is already lined up and they're just taking a few weeks of unexpected vacation before starting.  \n\nAt the end of the day, you chose the place and everyone else had the option to veto it.

The friend could have spoken up that it was out of their budget, reached out to you separately, or gone to dinner but only ordered something small and cheap. It\u2019s not on you to assume other people\u2019s budgets or needs. You asked if they were cool with it and they said yes. That\u2019s all you can do.", "If the choice of the venue was a problem, why didn't anyone say something at the outset? You're not a mind reader. NTA.", "When I was on a budget I would fill up on bread and order soup for my meal. NTA", "NTA. dude could have used his words like an adult.", "INFO: Had the friend being laid off slipped your mind when you suggested that restaurant, or did it occur to you that they might not be able to afford it but you suggested it anyways? And how would you have felt if someone did ask to go somewhere less expensive? Trying to gauge if this was inconsiderate or just a genuine mistake. \n\nTbh tho this seems like the sort of low stakes personal issue that\u2019s mostly a series of misunderstandings/miscommunications that\u2019s too hard to really make a judgement on without knowing *every* detail, and ultimately is a bit of everyone\u2019s fault but not so much as to make any one person in particular an asshole. \n\nFor example, my possible judgements of your friend would be based on Did the laid off friend *actually* have a problem with the restaurant choice? Did they communicate that to the other friend? When? Did it occur to other friend that it could be a problem before laid off friend said something? Did laid off friend want other friend to say anything? I mean, if they were so concerned about it from the start they could have low key taken the fall for it and just been like \u201cI\u2019m not really up for something so fancy this week, how about [casual spot] instead?\u201d And if it *didn\u2019t* occur to them in the beginning either, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool for them to be so harsh with you. \n\nIt\u2019s just a lot of factors to consider for a problem where regardless of the judgement the resolution is still \u201cmake an effort to be a little more thoughtful next time.\u201d", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to make sure people are living within their means.

It\u2019s not OPs job to manage the friends money.", "You can also pull out of the dinner and say sorry guys something came up and I can\u2019t make it if you feel embarrassed about your financial status.", "OP can\u2019t guess at someone else\u2019s budget just because they got laid off. The friend could have savings, or have received a severance package, or just wasn\u2019t planning on changing their lifestyle because of the layoff. If they needed to save they could have reached out to OP separately or even just gone and ordered something small and cheap. OP isn\u2019t responsible for babying another grown adult.", "Depends.  If the resteraunt is in the price range of what the group usually goes to then I don\u2019t see an issue.", "Then why didn\u2019t the person just not beg off?  I did that plenty of times back when I was younger and couldn\u2019t afford to do something with my friends.", "The person could easily have asked for a different place or just not joined them.  OP asked it the place was okay with everyone.", "OP never said they split the bill, they could easily have paid their own checks.", "INFO: Why did you pick an expensive restaurant when you knew the one friend wasn't working? \n\nI think that's what makes you the AH. I'm not sure why you would do that in the first place.", "I'm not sure of your history, but I can tell you right now when I've been SUUUPER tight on money, I want to maintain appearances by hanging with friends so to be the one person who replies back to a group text and says \"yeah.... can't really afford that, can we go somewhere less expensive?\".... that's horribbbble.  I've had to do it before.  And honestly - I felt like my friendship wasn't the same after that.  They didn't want to do ANYTHING with me after I said I couldn't afford a $40 cover charge plus a 2 drink and food minimum.  It's already shitty to be financially down, so then add in social pressure to over-extend?  Yeah, OP is TA.", "Chandelier and Ross made them split the bill\u2026", "It can be hard but it still falls on them to say something.... if they said yes it's fine then it's on them.

They wanted to feel self righteous but only *after* the expensive food was eaten.", "I mean someone being embarrassed to speak up and admit they\u2019re not able to afford something doesn\u2019t make their friend the AH. OPs friend had ample time to suggest something else or message OP privately. If they said yes they can go and didn\u2019t have an issue with the spot how is it on OP if that person didn\u2019t give any indication that it would be an issue.", "I know that, I remember the episode.  OP never said the check was split though."]}
