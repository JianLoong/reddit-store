It could also be 'being offended on behalf of someone else' thing as well and the friend was completely ok with it.\n\nWithout more info i cant really decide", "While I understand the effected person should have spoken up, embarrassment is a real thing people. Maybe they were too embarrassed to say anything.", "Well, recently laid off guy could have piped up and *said* something-when *asked* if the restaurant you picked \n was a good choice. Or the person that \u201cpulled you aside and accused\u201d you of being \u201cinsensitive\u201d coulda said something, *before you all went out to eat*. \n\nOP, you may not have even known about the employment status of all attending.

I wouldn't say it makes you an asshole, but yes a little empathy can go a long way.\n\nPeople who are struggling financially don't want to have to beg for accommodation, and may feel embarrassed about having to advertise it. It's already stressful enough having that kind of uncertainty.\n\nMaybe they were genuinely okay with the choice, but it would have been worth it to pick a cheaper restaurant this time around just in case.", "I go to dinner regularly with my friends. I have recently been searching for a new employer and have been financially aware of this. It is up to ME to say if somewhere isn't in my budget. A few times now, I've offered to be the designated driver, so I don't have to worry about paying for drinks when we go out. You're NTA, it is a manageable situation.", "I'm going to have to say a soft YTA because you knew one of the people in the party was not working.

Point out the shamer and move on. This person as no friend.", "NTA You ran your choice by the group, and no one raised a flag. If there were a problem, anyone could have asked for a less expensive spot, and, of course, the laid off acquaintance could have begged off.", "Softly YTA\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say out loud \u201c I prefer cheaper option \u201c and not feel embarrassed. \nBut for group meets better choose mid priced options, shared dinners are more expensive anyway, people tend to drink more and order more in the company", "NTA - why would someone who's been laid off decide to go out to eat?  That's expensive!  The task fell upon you, you made the suggestion and everyone agreed.  The person that was laid off should've stayed home, not gone out anyway.", "NTA you did the work to organise and the feedback came far too late to do any good", "NTA- If everyone confirmed the restaurant you chose was fine why is there an issue after the fact?
