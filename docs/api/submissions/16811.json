So as I learn what those things are, I either avoid suggesting those things or collaborate with them on making it easier for them to say no.\"\n\nThe reason Ask vs. Guess culture conflicts can get very heated is because they're language differences essentially, where everyone is hearing a slightly different version of the same conversation.
