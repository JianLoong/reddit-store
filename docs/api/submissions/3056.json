We were at a little get together at a mutual friends house and we started talking. Now my friend hasn\u2019t seen me since before Covid. That was when I had really short hair, kind of like a boys haircut. But when lockdown happened, I just stopped cutting my hair and let it grow out. It\u2019s now past my shoulders.\n\nSo Kiera comes up me and tells me how surprised they are about my hair. I explained what happened and how I just decided to let it grow out on a whim. They asked, \u201cso are you back to being a girl now?\u201d I asked them what they meant and they said they thought I was trans or NB because I had short hair and dressed masculine (we were never super close so I guess they didn\u2019t know me well enough and just assumed). \n\nI laughed and said no, I\u2019m just a bit of a tom boy and I\u2019ve always been a girl. Kiera laughed and said, \u201cthat\u2019s just another way to say closeted gender queer.\u201d I was kind of confused by this and told her I\u2019ve always been a huge Tom boy growing up (wore my brothers clothes, played with his toys, played with boys, was always a boy when I played pretend, hated puberty, etc.) but I\u2019m still a woman. Kiera smirked and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got some news for you friend, you might not be as much of a woman as you think.\u201d\n\nI asked Kiera what they meant by that and they said, \u201cwell I was the same way as a kid but I was able to have the courage and confidence to accept my NB identity, you might want to do some reflection if you can\u2019t see it yourself.\u201d I responded saying, \u201cso if I don\u2019t do stereotypically feminine things then I\u2019m not a woman/girl? That\u2019s really sexist, you might want to reevaluate how you see sex stereotypes and gender roles.\u201d \n\nKiera kind visibly annoyed and said I was invalidating their identity and being transphobic. I told them that I was happy they felt confident enough to be who they were but insisting everyone who doesn\u2019t follow 1950s-esque sex stereotypes is not a man/woman is incredibly regressive. \n\nKiera just huffed and walked away. Later that night our mutual friend said Kiera told them they were really offended by our conversation and they felt unsafe because of it. \n\nAITA? I\u2019m just really confused. I have no problem with Kiera and them being NB, I\u2019m happy they felt they could finally be who they are but insisting I\u2019m NB or trans and in denial just because I\u2019m not a girly girl is kind of ridiculous.", "created_utc": 1669202862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2moxl/aita_for_saying_my_friend_is_being_sexist/", "score": 293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being a woman, man, or nonbinary, isn't about your interests and how you dress, it's about how you feel.. no one has the right to tell someone what gender they are, and no one can know what gender a person relates to without them telling them.

She had no business projecting *her* feelings about gender on *you.*", "NTA, your friend shouldn't have made those comments. However, it is quite evident from what you are describing that they are not comfortable and secure with discussing gender identity, perhaps because it's a tense topic for them and maybe they are oversensitive, so calling them sexist was perhaps not the most mature reaction. Sometimes is best to just stop engaging in conversation with people who are finding it hard to be open and respectful in that moment and just walk away.", "What on earth? Absolutely NTA. Also I'm a racially specific non-binary identity and I have long hair. It's hair. Hair doesn't dictate your gender or gender expression. Your friend sounds insecure/dysphoric about their own expression of their identity, so they're projecting their beliefs of how one should present onto others.

I\u2019ve gotten this treatment from plenty of people and it\u2019s unfortunate there\u2019s this degree of gatekeeping within the queer/lgbt community. This specific instance is particularly asinine considering a major lesson of non-binary people existing is that you can\u2019t always draw inferences, from gender expression, about gender identity and you\u2019d think this Kiera would have a better grip on that. I would hazard the guess that, given your pointing out that Kiera *recently* came out as nb, they are far less confident in their identity than they\u2019d like you to believe and therefore feel compelled to be as vocal as possible about it so that they essentially speak it into existence.

I'm just a woman who likes pants and sneakers and short hair and a bunch of 'stereotypical' male hobbies. Ain't nothing wrong with that, and there's no call for anyone to be policing other people's gender identity.", "NTA. Your friend was being sexist. You calling them on it doesn't mean you are trans-phobic. They are actually being very hypocritical as well. They cannot dictate your gender identity just like you can't (and don't) try to dictate theirs. \n\nI am also a tomboy. I am most comfortable in my jeans and tees, no makeup and just brush through my hair to style it. I am in a male dominated field. I also work on cars, build, and do a lot of home improvement.

I even broke an acrylic nail while changing my air filer. My nail tech laughed so hard when I told her where it went!

Your friend was trying to talk to you about how you have displayed gender fluidity in the past. It seems that you have never actually told them how you identify and they were trying to get a clear picture.  That they said \"you are back to being a girl now\" hints that you have done enough other nonfeminine things that people read you as somewhere else on the gender spectrum.  You are both young, so both have work to do on the language you use about these things.  So you should give Kiera a break just as your friends you give you one.

Like why would you get offended that someone held a mirror up to you life and showed you a different interpretation.  NAH", "NTA at all, however you said one thing that raised my eyebrows a bit. You were talking about being a tomboy (how I hate that word) and you mentioned \"hating puberty\" and \"always being a boy while playing pretend\". The other things are completely normal and healthy and just how many girls and boys naturally play. It's important to remember that play clothes and mud and the outdoors and such are not at all masculine; that's how children interact with the world.

What a lack of self awareness", "Yeah I found it funny how she equates a disagreement with being physically unsafe. Like idk how they go through life that emotionally fragile.

I have met so many women who suffered deeply from puberty, who experienced intense body issues *in particular* around secondary sex characteristics. I have not, to this day, met a single woman who thought puberty was a good time and something they loved. So you might want to rethink your assumptions big time.", "I know a lot of other women who hated puberty, even the ones who were more traditionally feminine. Puberty is awkward, painful, confusing, and just difficult to adjust to. Growing into your new body takes time and it\u2019s very common for girls especially to feel weird about the way their body looks as it changes. Now that I\u2019ve finished puberty and really grown into my body, I\u2019m a lot more comfortable with it. Discomfort during puberty and body image issues doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re trans or there\u2019s something wrong. It\u2019s growing pains.", "Your friend should know this is not how gender identity works. They\u2019re weaponizing their identity to invalidate yours. That\u2019s not okay. Regardless of your gender expression, if you feel comfortable calling yourself a woman, that is what you are. They\u2019re not unsafe being themself but has proven to you you can\u2019t be safe around them being yourself. Which is sad, because you as you are is still fighting against the same gender binary that they\u2019re fighting against, which you can still do as a cis straight woman, just by being yourself. You being a tomboy in this world is still a gender rebellion, and here your friend is trying to put you into boxes that uphold the same stereotypes that ultimately restrict everyone. I hope this is just a moment of insufferable excitement at the idea of finding more people like them (or could be a crush maybe?) but it is very invalidating to you.

The same thing was happening with the gay community in the past, which is what led to a lot of negative stereotypes of the only people allowed to be gay are butch lesbians and femme gay men, both inside and outside the lgbt community. It must be hard to find \"real\" mentors going through this stuff when you see so many loud, out there, brash public figures.", "Not to mention that Kiera said that op was invalidating their identity, but isn\u2019t that what Keira is doing to op? By basically telling op that she\u2018s not a woman and must be nb or trans just for liking \u201cboy things\u201d even though op says that she is a woman.", "Not a friend, doesn\u2019t even know OP much besides seeing each other around. This was based purely on appearances. \n\nNta OP, do you.", "Dont think its great to be transphobic in retaliation to misogyny\u2026", "This whole thread is using the wrong pronouns; Kiera may be an ass, but calling them 'her' and 'she' is wrong.", "their** they were absolutely TA but that doesn't mean it's ok to use the wrong pronouns", "I find that a lot of people who idenity as \u201c\u201dnon-binary\u201d\u201d and \u201c\u2018\u201cgenderfluid\u201d\u201d are often the people with the most rigid idea of gender roles, which is why, the moment someone isn\u2019t 100% traditionally masculine or feminine as they define masculine and feminine, it becomes \u201coh, I/this person must be NB/genderfluid/gender non-conforming!\u201d  At the end of the day it can be just as sexist as what it purports to fight.", "Damn.  I'm not even that woke.   But imagine you said the last couple of sentences to a trans person who was upset at someone who misgendered them.", "> Yeah I found it funny how she equates a disagreement with being physically unsafe.\n\nIf you're always the victim you're never responsible in your own mind.  Apparently they are more obsessed with other people's genitals than the right wingers.", "This.  Also, it\u2019s fairly normal for women especially to experience gender dysphoria when they go through puberty (which can last ten years, people forgot; it\u2019s not just a couple years starting at age 12 or whatever).  Your body is experiencing a lot of physical, emotional, and mental changes which also change how the world perceives you.  It can be incredibly hard to deal with and adapt to, which is why I\u2019m cautious when it comes to women in the sort of 12-24 age range identifying as trans/nb/getting irreversible surgeries/etc, especially as we\u2019re now seeing a lot of (FtM especially) detransitioners who are coming out and saying they wished they\u2019d never transitioned and that the way they were feeling was oftentimes brought on by puberty and the changes therein.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between that and being genuinely trans, is my point.  My FtM friend explained it very well to be once when he was expressing concerns at the sudden social trend of transititioning and the rise of irreversible surgeries and hormone blockers given to young people.\n\nPoint being one likes puberty!  It\u2019s awful!  You feel like a stranger in your own body and for women especially it\u2019s *hard*.  Your body changes so radically and you can\u2019t do anything about it.  Of course many of us don\u2019t want to change, and it takes time to get used to!  But the older you get the more everything settles and the vast majority of people will \u201cgrow out\u201d of the dysphoria.  Not all!  But most.", "They weaponize it as a way to go, \"ha I won\" there is no way I'm wrong cause I called you some sort of phobic. It's a terrible way, and she claimed to feel unsafe cause they realized they weren't going to win the fight, so what better way to get people on their side than to tell everyone they didn't feel safe cause that instantly paints you in a bad light even though they started it", "I agree.  Sadly we as a society have been allowing that argument tactic for years.  They think they can get away with it because for the last 6-10 years it\u2019s *worked*.  Just call someone a homophobe, transphobe, a racist, a sexist, a misogynist, whatever, and that was it: argument over.  Hollywood is still using that tactic to try and avoid valid criticism for all the terrible movies they\u2019ve been putting out recently.  \u201cYou just don\u2019t like it because you\u2019re \\[-ist/-phobic\\]\u201d!\n\nLuckily society is finally starting to put their foot down and say fight back against the weaponization of these buzzwords (especially since incorrect overuse of the words above as well as words like \u201cNazi\u201d and \u201cFascist\u201d cheapen the reality of many of those words), but there\u2019s still a lot of people out there who will throw them around at the slightest provocation.  They\u2019re serious accusations that usually make people immediately defensive, which is why these people use them :/ Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s true.", "Because it\u2019s not fun to start bleeding every month and suddenly grow boobs and have everyone look at you like you suddenly grew two heads, get PMS, etc smh"]}
