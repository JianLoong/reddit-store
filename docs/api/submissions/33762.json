Instead of fostering open communication, I confronted her without fully considering her perspective, and I insisted on reimbursement for the sheets without initially acknowledging the reason behind their use.

So first of all, you need to separate the two issues.\n\nIf you want respect as a homeowner/landlord, want to keep your belongings separate, and divide household chores, then why are you letting your mother get involved at all? Why even let her use your things without consequences that any roommate would face. Tell her strictly that she can respect your rules or she can find alternative accommodation.\n\nIf you want respect as a sister and want to set clear boundaries then tell her that you will no longer be allowing her to walk all over you, and will be going low contact if she continues her behaviour. In your case, this might mean you start locking up your room to keep your stuff safe, keep your food in a separate mini fridge in your room maybe, or in worst case scenario involve your mother if she is an impartial and sensible person.\n\nAll in all, i think you do need to get her out of your house for peace and harmony.", "NTA.  She's basically using you as a replacement mommy and expects that you subsidize her extra expenses.   \n\n\nPaying rent doesn't give her the right to take money out of your pocket.  And that's exactly what she's doing by taking your belongings.  \n\n\nAs another commenter stated, it's time to put a lock on your door, stop buying easily made and yummy food (and keep that which you do want locked up in your bedroom in a mini-fridge or the like), etc.    \n\n\nThen, make sure you have a firm conversation with her that you will not be subsidizing all her little extras and that you're tired of her taking money out of your pocket (again, that's exactly what she's doing.  It's not \"just sheets.\")\n\nFinally, be prepared to kick her out if she won't comply.", "Kick her out", "if she wants to act like a shitty roommate you should act like an uncaring landlord and terminate her lease. NTA.", "Your sister doesn't have 'boundaries'.. she just wants to step all over you and you take over the role as mother.\n\nShe needs to be evicted but because it's your sister it's not going to go down really well with her or your mother.\n\nDo you have 3 bedrooms?  Perhaps getting a friend to move in temporarily and be the spine that you haven't been able to form yet.  An external party might be able to pull her into line.  But don't hold your breath.\n\nIt may be worth making life quite uncomfortable for her.  What's she paying for?  And she is paying her share of combined bills.  I would go as far as changing the wifi password if she's not paying for it.  Not buying much food other than boring stuff over the next few weeks.  It's possible to live on cereal and toasted sandwiches.  Keep treats in your room under lock and key so she can't help herself.  I hope you have a lock on your door and if you don't, get one.  But get a reasonable one that is more difficult to pick or to break.  The stuff that she's using ie sheets/towels that she hasn't bought... well put that in your room too.  Have the electricity turned off if she's not paying her share.  So stuff that's not going to harm her but will be uncomfortable.  Let her know that if she leaves the house for any more than a week then you will consider her abandoning the place and you have a friend willing to fill her place when she says she's going to stay with your mom till you let her do what she wants.", "NTA\nTime to evict her and get a better housemate.  If your mother thinks this behavior is acceptable she can have her!", "NTA\n\nKick her out, shit is only going to get worse. With your mother enabling her, you will never win and will always be the bad guy, you deserve some peace in your own home", "NTA as you\u2019re the landlord, guess you should start the formal eviction process as she\u2019s never going to respect you or your boundaries", "NTA, but you're an enabler, so your right to complain dissolves over time as you don't take concrete action.", "NTA. Tell your sister that this isn't how you want to live, clearly state what is bothering you, and let her know if it continues you will be looking for a roommate who is more compatible to your lifestyle.", "This\n\nPlease grow some backbone and take a firm stance on the things you think are necessary to make it work between the two of you.\n\nIf she can't accept this, she should look for different accomodations\n\nDefinitely NTA"]}
