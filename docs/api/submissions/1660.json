I specifically set up my nanny cam to monitor it when I'm not home to make sure and even if I'm not home, it's no more than a couple minutes. If he's outside when he barks, as stated, I don't leave him to bark. I bring him in immediately. I set all of these things up as precautions 4 years ago, not because it's been a problem in the past. But literally just to do my due diligence to prevent a problem from surfacing. Can you please explain how taking these steps as precautions, not because there's a problem with barking, means he's a nuisance?", "That's a good ide. The cease and desist. I'm almost to the point of filing a harassment complaint with the police over his shouting at my dog now that bylaw deemed him not a nuisance", "That's the thing though, he is within all legal expectations. Bylaw did their investigation and found nothing. I even set up nanny cams to make sure. He's really not a loud dog and when he does bark, I bring him in immediately. I have never, not a single time in his life, left him to bark. I take precautions not because he has a problem with barking, but to prevent barking from becoming a problem. I think a lot of people are assuming he's barking for long periods because he's a large breed dog when he's really not and I wasn't able to actually explain in the post. I remember every incident for the complaints and can count on one hand how many barks he got in before being brought in and stopping. Every single one. Unfortunately there is no HOA in my community so Its just me, him, and bylaw. \n\nAs for training, he's actually a very well behaved, well trained dog. Due to his breed he has a protective instinct and when he gets into these moods, the only people he's alright with is myself and anyone else he sees regularly and then the mood stays for 3 days to a week. He is completely fine to walk (always on leash unless we're in a designated off leash zone and his recall is always 100%), just he has a defensive mood because he's stressed from all the commotion from the construction. Him being a giant breed dog gets a ton of attention and people will just walk up to him to pet him without asking. Especially children. He is muzzle trained and I do use the muzzle when he's in these moods, however any interaction with a stranger during these moods will cause it to last longer than the typical 3 days to a week and then it causes a fear of strangers for the unforeseeable future which is what makes it unsafe. even when I tell people not to touch him, 50% of the time they don't listen and do it anyways. There's just not enough characters allowed to be able to explain the aspects to this situation in the post itself.", "Where I live (a city in California) excessive noise can be reported any time if day.

Gardeners, construction cannot happen before 7", "As stated in other comments, the post doesn't allow enough characters to fully explain the situation. My dog literally never barks more than 30 seconds a few times a day. And even if he does bark while inside my house, YOU CANNOT HEAR HIM. You literally have to strain your ears from my backyard to hear him barking from inside the house. This isn't a situation of my dog barks endlessly at all hours of the day and night. I phrased the one sentence badly. I would like to be able to use my yard with my dog, even if my neighbor is outside. However, the second day my neighbor moved in, he started shouting at my dog aggressively which caused my dog to bark twice. I used my dogs quiet command and he stopped but the neighbor would come back out and shout at him again afterwards and after two weeks of this, the quiet command stopped being effective for this particular neighbor only. Then the construction started and my dog, already being on edge from the neighbor, became more on edge from the construction commotion. With the neighbor being unwilling to provide construction dates, I cannot arrange for alternative places for my dog while construction is happening as theyre there randomly without a clear set schedule.", "Wow. Just\u2026 wow.", "My area doesn't have an HOA. I live in the original area the settled my city back in the 1800s. Trying to get an HOA in here would be nearly impossible due to the age of the community and how large it is.\n\nYou can call bylaw in HOA communities here because they still enforce the entire cities bylaws. HOAs just have additional rules to city bylaws. But here, bylaw officers govern the entire cities bylaws. HOAs just deal with the additional rules they put in place for those specific communities that have a HOA. Bylaw will actually refuse to enforce HOA rules, however HOAs can enforce their own rules through civil suits through the public court system should you opt to not settle any fines they give you depending on the contract you sign with them when purchasing/renting. \n\nThen not sure how it is where you are, but the HOAs are dependent on the communities within the city as well. Like every new(ish) community has one but also every communities HOA is different. Like some allow fences some don't. Some enforce house colours and styles, some are fine with anything. So you can be in one community and it be like everyone can put their own unique spin on their property, and then go one community over (still within city limits) and every house will look identical.\n\nEdited to fix typo", "At midnight?

I'm literally just trying to be a good neighbor by being proactive and introducing myself and my dog and prevent any possible altercations even though it's such a slim chance. I think some people see \"large dog\" and think they must be aggressive and make tons of assumptions. I understand that large dogs can be intimidating which is why I take all these precautions but people are looking at the precautions as a thing I've done because of a problem, not something that's being done to prevent problems.\n\nI wish my neighbors had a large dog. The ones before had a 12 year old girl who absolutely adored my boy. We even built a tree house in the tree on their side of the yard and hung a ladder down on our side so she could come visit when we would be out with him.

I don\u2019t understand why you haven\u2019t trained your dog enough to behave when he is outside and supervised and others are near by. If this is such a problem, it sounds like you aren\u2019t providing an appropriate environment for a Great Pyrenees", "INFO OP Hey when you go hiking do you let your dog off-leash?", "Yes barking for 30 seconds intermittently throughout the day would be extraordinarily annoying, and I would be upset if I were your neighbor.", "He\u2019s not very well trained based on the fact that you can\u2019t take him for walks currently and how he reacts to people when he IS on walks. During this time of construction  you need to take him to a dig park (although based on walks he probably won\u2019t do well there) or somewhere else for walks. He needs the exercise that you used to give him", "I suppose. I've just always been on really good terms with all my neighbors and I guess I have too high of hopes and expectations for this one.", "I totally understand the whole \u201clarge dog\u201d and random people automatically make assumptions based on size & breed. My boy is a Pitbull/Staffordshire mix I rescued at 9 weeks old, & just turned 6 in September.

You\u2019re taking precautions to make sure he is safe, as well as others. Don\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s his house & his yard.

Ya there's a reason he's a failed livestock guardian lmao", "Typically I use his quiet command which was fine at first, but my neighbor started shouting aggressively at him immediately if we were outside. So every time my neighbor would shout, my dog would bark, I'd use the quiet command, he'd stop, but then the neighbor would come out and do it again. After about two weeks of it, the quiet command stopped working as effectively, so now I bring him in immediately.", "Then with the commotion of the construction, it has him on edge, and with his being a large breed dog, he gets a lot of attention on walks. So if I walk him, he has an aversion to strangers and gets defensive (not aggressive), but with strangers coming up to pet him, even when I say not to, they don't always listen, and then he is in that defensive moon longer than he would be. \n\nHe has a wonderful environment and is a wonderful dog and I'd very much like to answer further questions so assumptions aren't being made. As stated in previous comments, there is not enough characters allowed in the post to be able to effectively explain the situation.", "Nope. Only off leash in designated off leash areas.

You can't hear him well when you're outside and he's inside. Thats if he's barking which is very rare. We both also live in single detached houses, the super old, brick, incredibly well insulated type so there is no noise if you're in the neighbor's house. (Yes I have been inside his house with my old neighbors before). \n2. The noise complaints have only happened when I've been outside with my dog and he's barked at the neighbor or the construction workers, of which I brought him in immediately. I said 30 seconds. But it was moreso like 10. I can count the number of barks on one hand for every complaint.", "You're making a lot of assumptions though. What do you need clarification on?", "Lmao, try 30 seconds 3 times when I bring him outside. Try again tho", "You\u2019re not getting it. No one else likes your dog or wants to hear it barking. Needing to have your dog meet the neighbors so it doesn\u2019t bark and so that your neighbors can \u201cuse their yard\u201d means that your dog is a nuisance. Your dog not being able to be walked because it\u2019s so stressed out due to the neighbors being there means that your dog is not trained. I believe it when the neighbor complains and reports your dog for barking. \n\nI get that you\u2019re doing a lot of work to try and make your dog not bark and be a problem, but your dog is barking and being a problem. Your neighbor isn\u2019t just complaining on your dog because he\u2019s an asshole. He\u2019s complaining because your dog is barking. And from what you describe about your dog and its idiosyncrasies, I 100% believe your dog is barking and annoying.", "You're making a ton of assumptions. I muzzle trained him because it's always good for a dog to be muzzle trained in the case of an emergency where one is required. Just like he's crate trained even though he doesn't require one. I use the muzzle in these situations when he's on edge not because he's aggressive. HE IS NOT AGGRESSIVE. I use it as a preventative tool should a situation happen. He has never lunged, attacked, or bitten adult, child, or dog. When he's in these moods, he's more on edge in public, including dog parks. Putting a dog that's on edge in a dog park is actually an incredibly stupid idea and is an accident waiting to happen for any breed of dog and please never suggest that for a situation of a dog being defensive or on edge again because you clearly don't know what you're talking about. \n\nI agree, he needs the exercise I usually give him. However not in a way that has a high chance of causing other behavioural problems and actually becoming permanently fearful of strangers or other animals.", "Actually the most well trained dog can have a bad day.

So I tried to set up another meet and greet and request construction dates so I could make things easier for everyone by bringing my dog elsewhere while they're doing work. He ignored this as well. The construction dates are random so they're not there every day so I can't even predict. He's been in the house for about 4 months now and even shovelled, well what I assume, is his snow from his driveway into mine during the first snowfall. I've been trying to ignore the petty but it just keeps going and since bylaw deemed my dog to been within city legal expectations they won't do anything so I think he's trying to get revenge.", "Ya, if you haven't done so already, please read some of my comments. The post doesn't allow enough characters to actually explain the situation and many people are seeing \"irresponsible dog owner\" when that's actually the farthest thing from the truth.", "Your counterpoints aren't to due with my AITA though lmao. My question was if I was the asshole for calling bylaw on him instead of trying to talk to him directly for shoveling the snow between 12-1am because he's petty my dog was deemed not a nuisance by the city in their investigations lmao", "I'm on OP's side here.  30 seconds of barking a few times during the day, is really just part of life.  \n\nWe'll get a chorus of dogs going off sequentially occasionally.  Then there's the local motorcycle track that runs at night.  It's several miles away but the sound carries.  Or the occasional kid burning rubber on a nearby road.  Noise in neighborhoods is a part of life.\n\nIt's not like OP's dog is going off for 20 minutes, breathing for 5 then going off for another 20 minutes.  It kinda feels like you have some skin in the game here.  Maybe an annoying neighbors dog?\n\nThe new neighbor being obnoxious in the middle of the night is just AH territory.", "Sorry been a lot of people assuming. You're also doing a lot of assuming though in your comment as you don't understand the personality of my dog. I don't need training or dog handling advice. I understand my dog and his needs and I understand that he needs exercise which he typically always gets. However he is more on edge outside of the house and in new or different areas than he is at home with the construction. There is no solution until the construction ends and the neighbor stops taunting him.", "8-month babies lynx-point Siamese; 12-year old, flame-point ragdoll/Himalayan cross.", "I\u2019m just going to say that if I just moved into a new place and my neighbor immediately wanted me to meet his dog so it wouldn\u2019t be protective against me, I would immediately be uncomfortable. Like I have to meet your dog so enjoy my own backyard in peace. That\u2019s really not okay. I should be able to just enjoy my backyard in peace in the first place", "Got it.   NTA", "They sound so adorable! My one is a Russian Blue x Bengal and she's such a little shit. The other two are just normal domestic short hairs. One had been at the animal shelter for 6 months in a parrot cage and so I felt bad for her. The other I found as a 4ish week old kitten on the side of a highway. The vet though she was dropped by a bird of prey.", "As stated in other comments, the post doesn't allow enough characters to fully explain the situation. My dog literally never barks more than 30 seconds a few times a day. And even if he does bark while inside my house, YOU CANNOT HEAR HIM. You literally have to strain your ears from my backyard to hear him barking from inside the house. This isn't a situation of my dog barks endlessly at all hours of the day and night. I phrased the one sentence badly. I would like to be able to use my yard with my dog, even if my neighbor is outside. However, the second day my neighbor moved in, he started shouting at my dog aggressively which caused my dog to bark twice. I used my dogs quiet command and he stopped but the neighbor would come back out and shout at him again afterwards and after two weeks of this, the quiet command stopped being effective for this particular neighbor only. Then the construction started and my dog, already being on edge from the neighbor, became more on edge from the construction commotion. With the neighbor being unwilling to provide construction dates, I cannot arrange for alternative places for my dog while construction is happening as theyre there randomly without a clear set schedule.", "Russian blue/bengal mix! Eh, there was no telling which temperament would come out until it did. Would love to have a bengal but everything I\u2019ve read says they only play nice with same litter siblings. I thought the Siamese pair would already be bonded and not give the older boy too much hassle. He/we lost a pair of 16-17 year old DSH this year, both of us got depressed. Hence the kittens. Older boy and lil gurl adore each other\u2026snuggles, mutual grooming, tons of purring. Lil boy is trying to establish rank but, faced with a love up, tends to acquiesce in favour of group hugs. It\u2019s hilarious.\n\nETA thank whatever you believe in you found the 4-week old! And a parrot cage is no place for a cat. Xxx"]}
