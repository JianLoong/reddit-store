I stopped one day to see if it was okay.  \n\nShe was a big healthy rottweiler cross. I managed to get her into my truck and I took her home. It was by a busy street where I got her and I didn't want her running into traffic or anything. \n\nI put up signs for a lost dog and went on a few different Facebook groups. After a week of no success I called the local volunteer shelter to see about dropping her off. They said they were full and asked if she could stay with me.  \n\nShe was a good dog and I had her out in my old dog run. So I decided  just to keep her. I got her her own collar, and started walking her with my old dog. He was a fart that just laid around except for walkies. He died after about a week. It was like he was waiting to see I would be taken care of by a new pup if he left. \n\nShe started getting fat. Turns out she was pregnant. Took her to the vet. Puppies incoming. One new dog is okay seven not so much. \n\nAfter the puppies were born I made sure they went to the vet and got taken care of. They got dewormed and they got their first set of shots. I paid for everything. \n\nMy sister was at my house and saw all the puppies and asked if she could have one.  I said yes and told her how much for one. It was enough to cover the vet bill for that puppy and part of momma's bill and food. \n\nShe said I was being ridiculous to try and sell mutts and that no one would buy them.  She said she would take one after I found out for myself. \n\nI put out an ad for the pups with pictures. I added a few dollars each for a bag of food the vet recommended and a collar. I literally made no profit.  All I got out of the whole deal was a new dog and one puppy. \n\nAll five pups got forever homes in less than a week and when they were weaned and ready to go I gave them to their new families. \n\nMy sister came over again and saw all the dogs were gone except for Momma Cass and her pup Dinglenuts.\n\nShe had picked out a little  girl for herself so she was upset that I had saved a boy instead. I said she was crazy because that was my dog. \n\nI said that I had sold all the pups in a week and that they were all with their families. She said I was an asshole for not saving one for her and that she would have paid me for her.  \n\nI reminded her that she had the opportunity to get one and she turned it down.  \n\nShe is still mad but I think that pup is probably better off where she is.", "created_utc": 1691420575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kn7xu/aita_for_selling_some_pups_i_rescued/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sold them for enough to cover your expenses, not to make a huge profit.  You did a great thing taking in the Mama, it shouldn't cost you financially for her puppies.  A rescue or the pound would have charged more I'm sure.", "NTA\n\nYou had no obligation to \u201csave her one.\u201d She declined and your successfully sold the puppies. Why shouldn\u2019t you recoup the veterinary and care costs?", "NTA. Her loss. End of story. \n\nI want to thank you for making sure those pups were well taken care of before selling them.. You didn't have to do that at ALL. Warms my heart reading this. Thank you :)\n\nRest in peace to your old friend!", "NTA.  And THANK YOU for rescuing the dog, taking good care of her, and making sure her puppies found good forever homes!", "NTA, you are a good person and i am glad you at least broke even. Which of course you did not because who counts all the hours you gave the pups taking care of them while you had them.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister took a gamble and lost.  If she really wants a new dog, she can go to the full shelter and adopt one.\n\nInitially, she wanted a free puppy from you, and was hoping to get one where you paid for the expenses and she would \"take it off your hands\".  Your sister is cheap.", "Agree with other posters, NTA. You did a good thing.", "Nta. She not only wanted a free puppy, she didn't even want to pay for their first vet bills.", "YNTA, she is. you gave her an opportunity to buy the dog and she didn't just refuse, she was rude about it and told you no one would buy them, then when it was too late she had the audacity to play victim", "NTA. You only did what's right splitting the costs between people that care, your sis had a major chance to get the puppy she wanted before anyone else.", "NTA\n\nyour sis is entitled and delusional.", "NTA. She had an opportunity and she missed it. Also, good job on taking in that momma and her pups and getting them vet care.", "NTA\n\nWhether you sold them for $1k a piece, the act of saving the mother and subsequent litter from a dangerous situation is invaluable.", "NTA. You seem like a good person.", "NTA. All the good pups got homes.", "Depending on how much you were asking for NTA. It can be expensive to raise puppies to weaning/forever homes (partners family ended up with two accidental litters) they sold them to forever homes for a loss/not for profit (that was for pure bred pups too) again just enough to cover vets/raising them. Friends and family were first offered. Your sister is mad she missed out.", "NTA.\n\nGreat job helping a dog in need. And helping 7 puppies find homes. It\u2019s a lot to take on. If your sister really wanted a puppy, she could have paid for the privilege.", "NTA. It's fair to cover your expenses. You sister only wanted a cute little free puppy. You did a great job in keeping them with the mom till they were weaned and finding them good homes. I've worked in rescue and the adoption fee helps weed out people who just want a cute little free puppy, in addition to defraying the costs of deworming, shots etc. And...Dinglenuts is a great name!", "NTA, OP you're a legend for rescuing those dogs", "NTA, I wouldn't even refer to this as a sale. It's more of an adoption fee. I know its kind of the same, but a sale implies profit, which you didn't.", "Nta, but I hope with rotties you did severe background checks with the new owners. They are expert dogs, for the love of god don't sell one to your sister.", "Sounds like normal sibling misunderstanding. Don\u2019t think anything of it.", "NTA. In every single way. She said no, when you offered to sell her a puppy. She can't just criticize your plan, and then get mad, when it worked. Too bad, lady. You missed out.\n\nBTW. Dinglenuts.... Best name ever! 10/10. Would Dinglenut again.", "NTA, you're probably the furthest away from an asshole on this whole sub.  You're good folk.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't profit. You just covered your costs.\n\nFrom what I read you did the right thing.\n\nYou let them wean properly.\n\nI assume she didn't take Dinglenuts?\n\nI wish I could see photos.", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
