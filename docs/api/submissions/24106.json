It was by a busy street where I got her and I didn't want her running into traffic or anything. \n\nI put up signs for a lost dog and went on a few different Facebook groups. After a week of no success I called the local volunteer shelter to see about dropping her off. They said they were full and asked if she could stay with me.  \n\nShe was a good dog and I had her out in my old dog run. So I decided  just to keep her. I got her her own collar, and started walking her with my old dog. He was a fart that just laid around except for walkies. He died after about a week. It was like he was waiting to see I would be taken care of by a new pup if he left. \n\nShe started getting fat. Turns out she was pregnant. Took her to the vet. Puppies incoming. One new dog is okay seven not so much. \n\nAfter the puppies were born I made sure they went to the vet and got taken care of. They got dewormed and they got their first set of shots. I paid for everything. \n\nMy sister was at my house and saw all the puppies and asked if she could have one.  I said yes and told her how much for one. It was enough to cover the vet bill for that puppy and part of momma's bill and food. \n\nShe said I was being ridiculous to try and sell mutts and that no one would buy them.  She said she would take one after I found out for myself. \n\nI put out an ad for the pups with pictures. I added a few dollars each for a bag of food the vet recommended and a collar. I literally made no profit.  All I got out of the whole deal was a new dog and one puppy. \n\nAll five pups got forever homes in less than a week and when they were weaned and ready to go I gave them to their new families. \n\nMy sister came over again and saw all the dogs were gone except for Momma Cass and her pup Dinglenuts.\n\nShe had picked out a little  girl for herself so she was upset that I had saved a boy instead. I said she was crazy because that was my dog. \n\nI said that I had sold all the pups in a week and that they were all with their families. She said I was an asshole for not saving one for her and that she would have paid me for her.  \n\nI reminded her that she had the opportunity to get one and she turned it down.  \n\nShe is still mad but I think that pup is probably better off where she is.", "created_utc": 1691420575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kn7xu/aita_for_selling_some_pups_i_rescued/", "score": 509, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Great damn dog and despite being old and diabetic, he lived for many more years.\n\nGot my current old man for $250 from a shelter.", "Didn't realize how lucky I was. Got my boy, Ron, 6 years ago for $25. If he weighed a pound less he would've cost a whopping $50 in Louisiana for reference", "NTA. We found a purebred Husky out on a hike and managed to wrangle her with some rope. Took her straight to the vet, where they found lumps in her tummy. \n\nThey were rocks. She\u2019d been eating grass and rocks to stay alive.\n\nNo chip but we put out a call far and wide. No one claimed her. But after we spent months getting her healthy, suddenly people came out of the woodwork to \u201ctake her off\u201d our hands.\n\nWe posted her for sale, for $750. Got a few people who really wanted her, including a young woman who raised the breed in Alaska with her dad. \n\nShe was finishing her master\u2019s degree and already was half-moved for some forestry job in West Virginia. She\u2019d created a huge dog run over two acres for her own husky and wanted him to have a friend. \n\nWe let her think we were charging her, all the way up to the last minute. We just let her have the dog, because it was clearly the ideal place.\n\nShe still sends us pics of the stray, along with the other half-dozen or do husky and husky mixes she\u2019s rescued; no more breeding but she will occasionally bring a dog up to her family\u2019s in Alaska.\n\nLong story long, once you rescue and invest, it\u2019s your charge and you can do whatever is best.", "The only bit that makes you an AH is you didn't put the pet tax in the post \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 also I love the name dinglenuts \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 \nIn all seriousness not your sister made a stupid assumption and I think your right the pup us in better home", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing by finding them loving homes.  Also, you only asked for enough money to cover what you paid to make sure they were healthy and happy.    Plus your sister sounds like she would be a terrible pet owner.", "Dinglenuts...\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\udc4d", "NTA: She tried finagle getting a free dog at you expense, and she finagled herself out of a dog. The dogs are better off with owners who can be fair.", "NTA. I love the name of your puppy.", "Also took a chance doing the right thing and doing all the basic vet work.", "Need to see this DingleNuts!", "Depends on the shelter. My dog was $30 from the city shelter, but my boyfriend's dog was free from the county shelter (he donated money though).", "That and the fees tend to go back into helping run and maintain the shelter typically.", "I mean, my city\u2019s shelter has adoption fees of $30. This covers the shots, the microchip, and the spay/neuter surgery. We always question why people argue the $30, actually caring for a pet is a lot more expensive \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My boy from the city shelter was the best $50 I ever spent!
