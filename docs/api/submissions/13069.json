Then you can come to an agreement & be on on the same page, or at least the same chapter!\n\nIf the daughter has any carers, teachers, etc, it would be worth you all updating them too, so they know what approach to use & anything to avoid.

They also encouraged my interests & took an interest even if it wasn't what they liked or was deemed socially unaceptable (like nerdy or wierd, not morally bad or illegal!) They still do to this day, I am now able to do the same with them to an extent, their approach really helps me feel accepted & cared about.\n\nI really believe my outcome now as an adult of being more confident, not ashamed, resiliant & content is mostly from those positive adult influencers in my childhood.

There\u2019s a good chance that the kids were upset by it. Especially since they were \u2018polite\u2019 about it and not openly happy - they probably felt weird celebrating too much in front of their nonverbal sibling.\n\nIt\u2019s totally natural to celebrate and it slipped your mind how it may feel to the nonverbal kid. I\u2019d find a non-obvious way to single out/celebrate one of that kid\u2019s accomplishments in a similar way. And/or give them some extra attention.

She had to actually record me during one of these play sessions to prove to my preschool that I did, in fact, speak English, and *well* so that they would let me attend because they thought she had been lying the entire time about my verbal abilities and that I might\u2019ve even been verbally delayed. I\u2019d refused to speak English when I went in for my in person interview, and barely spoke at all. In my defense, I was in a strange office, in a strange building, with strange adults staring at me and asking me to basically perform for them so they could assess me. That\u2019s anxiety inducing at *any* age.\n\nThe way my parent tells the story is hilarious- according to her, she was absolutely exasperated, and desperate because it appeared they wouldn\u2019t be allowing me in, and after trying to get me to perform in person on multiple occasions for the school counselor, principal, headmaster, trying to get me to speak on the phone (no thank you!), even going so far as to trying to trick me into speaking while she held the phone near me (which apparently I found quite suspicious) just so they could hear me, she finally showed up at the school with a rainbow colored Fisher-Price tape recorder, hit play, and my chatterbox voice just came on, prattling on and telling stories in full English sentences\u2026 absolutely stunning the (literally) wide-eyed principal. At the end of her very frayed rope by this point, my parent just exclaimed \u201cdo you believe me now?!\u201d And the principal nodded. Granted, this story is family legend at this point so who knows how much embellishment it\u2019s received over the years, but that\u2019s how my parents always tell it.\n\nMuch to their surprise, the begrudging school ended up with a bilingual kid who consistently tested in the 99.9th percentile for language, recognized all the written letters in the alphabet by age 2, and was reading and writing at a *very* early age.

I would say that it's not accurate at all to say that all of us have delays in language to some degree. For sure back in the 90s it was the assumption because it was easy enough to notice and was often what got kids diagnosed in the first place. Also some autistic kids who don't talk don't actually have any issue with language, they literally just prefer not to talk for various reasons. But that causes a big bias in the population with kids who were hyperlexic or had no particular language delays falling through the cracks. I was hyperlexic myself and while people could tell something was \"off\" about me, I didn't look like the prototypical autistic kid that most people, and even specialists, understood at the time. Wasn't diagnosed until adulthood. We're a very varied bunch and some of us like maths, some of us hate it. Some of us are creative types and some of us aren't.

I pretty quickly started talking in full sentences and to their regret, never shut up. \n\n(Not autistic, but do have ADHD so I do have a neurodevelopmental disorder)", "I love this so much, and I relate so hard \ud83d\ude2d", ">My little sister was talking extremely young full sentences by 6 months\n\nWould absolutely love to see this video if you can share it?", "my bad, thanks!", "I sadly don\u2019t have it anymore it was forever ago, shes 14 now lol.", "On the right tail means you've above average, so that doesn't really make sense.", "Kids don't \"learn to cry.\" Crying is a natural reflex to getting hurt or startled; you see this in babies, who react to pain or sudden loud noises by instantly crying. They don't stop to look around at people's reactions. Older kids (toddlers and up) do still have that instinctive cry response to intense events, but they're also capable of crying in order to get sympathy. This isn't a total acting job, usually -- it's more of a complex emotional reaction. \n\nYou see this when a kid (like 3 or 4 years old) falls down and hurts themselves, then gets up and runs over to a parent and only starts to cry when they reach the parent. They're actually crying for real, not faking it, but it's a multi-layered response.\n\nKids sometimes also try out-and-out fake crying, but it's so easy to spot that it doesn't usually get them the reaction they want.", "That is beautiful. I will someday have bilingual kids, so thanks for sharing!", "My derp.", "> They unfortunately never said what causes the difficulties in speaking just that it\u2019s there to some degree in all who have it\n\nThis is not actually the case these days.

He's #3 and all he needed to do for the longest time was point and grunt and I and my other brother would interpret.", "NTA - it\u2019s important to teach kids in sharing joy in someone else\u2019s success. It will teach kids how to be more satisfied in life vs being resentful. \n\nI would tell stepmom \u201cthis isn\u2019t about creating an environment of winners and losers. It\u2019s about celebrating everyone\u2019s wonderful successes. I think with stepdaughter not speaking is overwhelming for you. It\u2019s for all of us - but I want to create an environment where we cherish all milestones and that includes the step kids.\u201d", "NTA.

She\u2019s also Autistic. \n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. The ex came in a little too hot, but I\u2019ve been in her shoes to an extent, so I\u2019m going to assume she was coming from a place of sadness or protectiveness over her child. \n\nI am *always* happy for my nieces and nephews or friend\u2019s kids when they speak for the first time, and I show nothing but joy for them. But deep down it still feels like another little piece of my heart breaks for my daughter each time. \n\nI think its important to remember moving forward with your family dynamic that it\u2019s not mutually exclusive\u2014your youngest deserves praise and excitement for her accomplishments, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to her for you guys to minimize them or hide your joy. But your stepchild also clearly is sensitive about her situation (or maybe just her mom, idk lol) and needs to be shown that her own unique milestones are also special, and that she\u2019s not lesser than or failing by not hitting certain milestones. Find ways to celebrate and praise her and help her recognize the ways she is great and progressing too :)\n\nAnd again, I don\u2019t think you did anything out of line. I just know a bit about the emotional complexities of the ex\u2019s situation, and I think it\u2019s just coming from a place of pain and misplaced anger.", "> No, it is very unusual and almost always a sign of neurodiversity or disability\n\nMy daughter i think tried to talk too early.  She had a language of her own with a lot of sounds like \"gah-gah\" and somehow we all knew what she meant or wanted.  She was very quiet for the first couple years of her life.  Around age 3 she said her first real word and i about cried tears of happiness.  I'm trying to sum this all up really short and sweet, i swear lol.   \n\nSummer between kindergarten and 1st grade, some switch flipped and she went from quiet to tazmanian devil lol.

One of my best friends didn\u2019t talk until age 5 and ended up just kind of winning at life after that.

I\u2019ve read the study.\u201d So wouldn\u2019t that apply to me? \u201cWell, you weren\u2019t diagnosed in school, so you don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how is this affecting your work?\u201d I don\u2019t currently work.

It\u2019s called coping skills. \u201cIf you really had ADHD, you would have gotten out of your chair at some point.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s three different professionals.
