If I don't care about her opinion when it comes to her own children, my relationship with my step kids is dead in the water. Why would they open up to me if they can tell I don't respect their mother?", "Snitch got what was comin to her lol", "I was apparently a bit slow to talk too, and then started out with basically full sentences. I\u2019ve always liked to learn how to do things before I actually do them, I guess.", "That\u2019s such a kid thing to do. When my 5 year old was 2 he talked all the time at home. At school the teachers never heard him say a word. Probably thought he was mute. \ud83e\udd74", "I knew a family where the youngest was delayed in talking and walking because there was a doting parent and slightly older sibling who would \"help\" by giving or taking the youngest to whatever they pointed or grunted at. As soon as they stopped for a few days, the kid was running and talking in sentences.", "Oh my god, that is such a kid thing to do! My son dislocated his elbow (very common when they\u2019re about two, or so they told me) and I rang the doctor and made an emergency appointment. As we were leaving, he fell over and I picked him up and cuddled him and got him out to the car. Halfway there, I looked in the rear view mirror and he looked right at me and waved his no longer dislocated arm at me - apparently the fall out it back in. I had to go and apologise to the doctor for wasting his time", "My eldest got around 5 and started squinting CONSTANTLY watching TV, looking at signs, all kinds of \"far away\" stuff... she would start squinting. I assumed she needs glasses, we go to the optometrist, he takes me aside to ask why I thought she needed glasses, as her vision was really great. I told him, he laughed and says, \"She's just testing how her eyes work.\"\n\nI was so embarrassed!", "My husband's mom tells a similar story about taking him to the pediatrician because he wasn't walking. My husband stood up in front of the doctor and walked across the room to take a toy from his brother.", "When I was about 2 I wasn't speaking much either. My uncle asked and my mom told him maybe I had nothing to say to him. No I don't shut the fuck up.", "But why are you looking at and thinking about this situation without any context?\n\nLike, if you and she had previously gotten along all the time and were friendly with each other then yes, take her complaints about \"mistreatment\" of her children to heart. Or if your husband adamantly agreed with his ex's complaint.\n\nBut you say that isnt how your relationship has ever been. Common sense would say that anyone on the planet would be happy their child spoke their first words and only someone acting extremely illogically would be angry at someone being happy their child spoke their first words, simply because they have a child who can't speak.\n\nAn ex spouse finding something to be upset about regarding their ex's new family is like the most common trope in the world and I cant imagine thia is the first time you've heard of it happenong. If you're going to question every time your husband's ex complains about something they have no right to complain about, you're not going to have much free time.", "You\u2019re so right! \ud83e\udd23", "I talked (to other people) later than my brother (though still within the average developmental range), but I used full sentences, pronounced everything correctly, and even was sarcastic as soon as I started. My mom says she'd overhear me having \"conversations\" with my dolls and stuffed animals, so she thinks I just wanted to speak perfectly once I talked to my family and was \"practicing\" with my toys.\n\nRegarding the sarcasm: I was about 16 months old when I finally started talking regularly, and we were on a road trip to visit family. On the way back we were going up and down a bunch of hills, and as we went over them, I sang, \"To-MAAAAAA-to,\" with the long syllable on the peaks. After about an hour of this, my mom said, \"Enough with the tomato!\" I quietly responded, in the snarkiest tone a one year old can muster, \"Lettuce.\" My family couldn't help their laughter, and so they reinforced the family sarcasm tendency at a very young age.", "I was only speaking with single words until quite late and my mom was getting worried. At 5, I then shocked everyone on with \"give me Bo Bear or I'll kick you in the knee\" as my first sentence :D", "My sister was the same!  No talking until like age 3, not a single sound, and then one day, \"Mommy, can I have chocolate milk?\"  Doctor joked that she just wanted to get it right first try.", " I may be super jelly of other kids, but I sure as hell don't resent them OR their parents for it.", "Have an upvote. I was completely non verbal until 3 or so. Then one day I walked up to something and pointed at it and said \"What's that?\" According to my parents after they answered the question, I nodded and repeated the name of the thing and walked over to the next thing again and said \"What's that?\" so on and so forth.  \n\n\nby the next week they couldn't shut me up. I also started reading at 4 years old.", "Thats exactly how I was, and how I currently am.\n\nNote: I am indeed on the spectrum......", "I told my daughter's preschool teachers that I was concerned that she was color blind, or that something was seriously wrong. I would sort things into piles by colors, for example, and say \"point to the pile that is blue.\" Or \"what color is this?\" And she would give me a blank stare and say something nonsensical,  like door.\n\nHer preschool teacher laughed at me and said she knew all her colors. My kid was just fucking with me.", "Apparently, a friend of mine could speak just fine as a child but would only speak to his mom. Not even his dad.  When he got to kindergarten, he still refused to speak to the other kids or the teacher. They brought his mom in for a meeting. He still refused to speak to any of the teachers. His mom finally asked why he wouldn't talk to anyone else. He said, \"I don't wanna talk to them. They're not smart enough.\"", "haha, yes, similar to this, my cousin has 3 children.  The two girls are older and the boy is a few years younger. Being girls, they talked a lot and relatively early.  However, the little boy was late in speaking because his two older sisters did all the talking for him. He is now in high school and talks just fine.", "I suspect my youngest nephew of this. He's got 2 parents & 2 older sibs who will \"help,\" but if they don't hear him/respond fast enough then he'll scoot off to get what he wants.", "My brother at like 16 or 18 months favored one leg. He didn\u2019t use the one leg, and would sit a lot more than usually. Even when he crawled, he wouldn\u2019t use the one leg. Didn\u2019t cry or anything, but just calmly refused to use it.\nThis went on for days. My parents took him to a physical therapist friend, and suddenly he just started using it again like nothing was different. \n\nHe would also practice crying in the mirror. I guess he was such a little actor, and liked to see how it affected the adults. \n\nHe\u2019s a great kid now. But he has had a few times where he is quite dramatic with some \u201cinjuries\u201d that mysterious happen.\nWhich is so funny because he had heart surgeries as a baby and is tough as nails when it comes to actual medical issues. \nBut suddenly, at the perfect timing his \u201cknee will hurt\u201d convincingly, and he\u2019s good when it\u2019s time to play a sport. \n\nKids are smart", "I was a late walker myself, and like your husband I just stood up one day and walked over to go get something I wanted. Lol", "I also started reading really early, 3 or 4. Maybe it\u2019s related! I don\u2019t have much memory of that timeframe so have to rely on what I\u2019ve been told but I really liked being read to and when no one would read me the book, I decided I could do it myself! \n\nProbably at that point I had just memorized the book, but I can\u2019t remember not knowing how to read, either. I found kindergarten very boring until my mom suggested I just tell them I already knew how which hadn\u2019t occurred to me.  Then I was sent home with a note that She can Read!!!!", "My kid had a rough time at preschool because every time the teacher tried to put her through her paces of shapes/letters/numbers/colors, she legitimately looked at her and said \u201cyou know all this stuff, you don\u2019t need me to tell you.\u201d\n\nWhich is how my little smart ass kid almost failed preschool. \n\nOP, NTA. You can celebrate all of the kids\u2019 accomplishments!"]}
