I may be super jelly of other kids, but I sure as hell don't resent them OR their parents for it.

If you spend their lives walking on eggshells just to make sure the youngest doesn't get her feelings hurt, she will become spoiled and your other kids will grow to resent her and you.\n\nYour husband's EX sounds petty and needs a reality check.

Keep being excited about your baby!", "NTA, You can't squash one kids milestones and accomplishments because it might hurt another. One day the kids are going to be adults, and your child will come to resent his half siblings if he has to keep quiet about his accomplishments so he doesn't upset them.

I think you're right that at this point apologizing to her might make her feel worse, and your husband's ex is out of line for that \"your baby probably didn't even say a real word\" comment, which was bizarre and insulting. \n\nBut honestly, it was a little thoughtless for you to tell everyone for the first time all together with your stepdaughter present. No, you shouldn't hide that the baby is starting to talk. But she probably has very complicated feelings about being nonverbal, and witnessing your and your husband's *immediate* reaction (extreme excitement, celebration, and joy) might have been somewhat hurtful or difficult to navigate, especially as the youngest kid who was previously the baby of the family. I also wonder if your older stepkids might have felt defensive of her, seeing as presumably their mom found out because one of them told her.", "Depends on what the first word is. \n\nIf it\u2019s \u201cbaba\u201d then NTA.

It\u2019s totally normal to be excited about this milestone and share it with your husband.   I don\u2019t it was necessary to make a big deal of it with your stepkids, and it was pretty insensitive given one of them is nonverbal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

First because it is very exciting.  Next because your step-daughter will see that it is normal and okay and exciting.  She can still choose to talk when she is ready.  If everyone goes silent around her, what does that solve exactly?  Nothing.  If anything, it makes them worse.", "She's absurd. My son is 8, nonverbal, and I while I get my feelings hurt when I'm around other kids his age, because I wish he could talk to them, I NEVER get offended by it. That's dumb and hypocritical. So she's gonna yell at everyone that talks? GTFO here, lady. \n\nYou have every right to celebrate milestones. She's likely feeling some kind of way, because it is hard to have a child not meeting milestones, but that's not your fault. She needs to grow thicker skin.\n\nNTA", "NTA You're not gloating, you're celebrating your kid.

NTA", "NTA", "Is it common to be non-verbal up until 5/6?\n(I don\u2019t mean to sound like a jackass, I honestly just thought that every kid started to talk on the age of 1/2)", "Presumably one of the kids told her.", "Right? Seems sus", "Yes, she is autistic.", "There's no excuse for how she treated OP. She's a major asshole.", "Or they have nonverbal autism....", "She doesn't usually try to vocalize. She points and does charades, but she doesn't try to talk. She seems to have very little interest in it. Her uncle started teaching her sign language, and she has learned a few signs, so we think that might end up being her way forward. She does understand when we talk to her though. Like, if I ask her what she wants to drink, she will bring me a juice cup (all the drinks have different kinds of cups) to let me know she wants juice. So she understands.", "it\u2019s more like they communicate without words (so body language and possibly other tools like pictures of things wanted, etc), so stepdaughter probably hasn\u2019t said her first words yet and it seems to be a touchy subject for the bio mom", "I would assume from one of the other children.", "I'm confused by this. How could a baby's first word be Worcestershire? It was \"no.\"", "If her kid got a scholarship to a fancy college should she not celebrate because the others didn't get one? I think it's stupid to squash one kids accomplishments just so the other doesn't feel hurt. That's not fair to the one who accomplished something. First words ARE a big deal, and the half sibling needs to learn to deal with her feelings, not have the world accommodate her the rest of her life.", "I mean I don't really see how that's an issue, unless op is leaving something out. It just sounds like the step kids were around while op was getting excited about her child's first words. If anything I think it would have been more insensitive to exclude the nonverbal child for something out of their control.", "No it wasn't.", "No, it is very unusual and almost always a sign of neurodiversity or disability", "My nephew was nonverbal til about the same age and he\u2019s diagnosed autistic. Oddly enough I have another nephew born two whole days later and is neurotypical. BUT this has not stopped my sister from celebrating every single milestone of our nephew and we celebrate her son\u2019s as well because they\u2019re different. I sobbed like a baby the first time he got on the phone with me and told me how much he loves his auntie and wanted to come to my house \ud83d\ude05", "It's not common. It's also not common for children who are nonverbal for that long to spontaneously begin to talk.\n\nMost commonly if a child is not verbal at that age there is some sort of reason (ASD, IDD, motor speech, etc), and usually a speech therapist will be needed to help figure out what's going on and how to help the person communicate (through words, signs, pictures, a high tech device, etc)", "That is what I was thinking, but just making sure.  It\u2019s an odd thing to bring up in conversation with their mom unless they were specifically asked. If the siblings feel the way the mom does there may be some resentment building up there. NTA though, milestones are milestones and blowing someone else\u2019s candle out to make yours shine brighter is still wrong no matter the age.", "Even more NTA. Having worked with children with autism for years, the ex is clearly insecure about her being non verbal, I bet the six year old couldn\u2019t give a rats about any of it. Massive projection.\n\nI know there\u2019s other ways they can communicate so the only thing that could make you TA is if your step daughter said she was upset.", "My four year old is nonverbal. The worst part of me feels maybe sadness when I hear about her cousins' milestones or maybe indifference, but, fuck, getting upset and causing a scene is a dick move. We all love our kids and we should always celebrate their accomplishments. Sure, what I celebrate might be different than the \"typical\" parent, but what decent human being would feel threatened by a kid who is loved and encouraged in front of their child.", "Yeah. If so. Then it\u2019s the ex just wanting to show her behind thinking she is correct.", "You should also consider making one of those emotions charts with faces on it if she doesn\u2019t already have one so she can better express how she\u2019s feeling", "You might suggest to your husband that they look into an AAC device as well! There are lots of options these days now that tablets are so accessible!", "Yeah you\u2019re definitely NTA. It had nothing to do with your step daughter, you were excited about your baby. \n\nDoes the ex wife make things about herself a lot? She seems to enjoy being the victim.", "The point they were trying to make is that if it was a fairly difficult word to pronounce then it could have seemed as if you were saying something like \"look at what my child can do that the others definitely couldn't do!\" and since that was not the case they're saying you're NTA.", "Then NTA. \ud83d\ude01", "Indeed.  Life is hard, get a helmet.", "I'm a biased source, but I think she's obsessed with being the center of attention."]}
