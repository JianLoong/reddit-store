Your responsibilities towards your other children don't disappear simply because you decide to start a do-over family.

Everything your ex said is right. The older child is more expensive and you should absolutely be contributing to raising him. You have another kid is irrelevant. It doesn\u2019t get you off the hook.

A situation which you chose.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you make less than he does, the parent who has custody the majority of the time (him) is entitled to child support from the other parent (you).  If the ordered amount does not reflect the change your income, apply to the court for it to be changed.  And the additional things that your ex is asking you to contribute to are all reasonable for a child of that age.  He should be able to play football at school.  He should be able to see properly and have braces if he needs them.  FFS.  If you just keep refusing to pay for your kid, then YTA for not supporting your kid.  You don\u2019t just get to wash your hands of him because you have a new baby.  I wonder how this kid feels about you.  I expect he doesn\u2019t care for you much at all.", "YTA!!!! My stbx had an ex like you! You're a deadbeat mom! It makes me so angry that women like you think because you're the mom, you should either get support or not pay at all.
