However, my brother in law decided to bring his unofficial grandson along from Saturday to Monday. I agreed to this but then he said he will actually be staying till Wednesday. This boy is 9 with behavioral issues and I can only take him in small doses as he is difficult and does not get along with my kids. Every time he brings this kid I do my best but tell hubby not to leave me as babysitter. He \"forgets\" this each visit and goes out fishing and shooting with his brother for hours multiple times per day. My MIL is very weak and can barely get around or make a snack so she is also high maintenance. I don't mind helping her at all. Sunday night after gorging on junk food all day the boy was crying on the couch to my BIL about his tummy who ignored him and sure enough he began to vomit all over my living room. I got up and went to sleep in my kid's room and texted my husband to get home now and clean up. The next morning on the way to the bathroom I see vomit stains on the floor and alerted my husband who cleaned up. Then, instead of making sure they didn't miss anything else in the light of day and making sure the boy was okay the men went fishing for 3 hours. I stayed in bed and my MIL did not feed the boy. When the men came home I asked my husband if he checked the pillows and blankets on the couch for vomit but he snapped at me. After that, I got a hotel and my kids and I left. My MIL told me I was being dramatic and I was not in charge of the boy as she was there even though she can't take care of herself.

If he is not willing to discuss this with you and make serious changes to how guests are managed going forward - you have a much bigger problem than vomit stains.", "NTA\n\nBIL is just using you as a babysitter for his grandson. Your husband needs to put a stop to that. Tell him no hunting and fishing if grandson is there - unless they take him with them.", "NTA. I read the whole thing and still think its a NTA, but I could have stopped after the part where you said BIL brought his 9 year old kid with behavioral issues, unannounced. That is not okay, especially given your living situation.\n\nI am curious for more INFO though, not to change my ruling just out of curiosity.\n\n1. Why don't your BIL and MIL stay at a hotel while visiting?\n2. Why did you make your husband clean up the kid's mess. Why is BIL not the one cleaning that mess up?", ">She also told me I wasn't raised this way and that men go out and women stay home. \n\nShe's correct.  You weren't raised with a sexist attitude.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You are being treated like an unpaid babysitter and maid. Your husband is not \"forgetting\" he is choosing to treat you that way. Stand your ground. Everytime the inlaws \"visit\". leave. If your kids are a bit older...leave them with daddy and you go get some relaxation. Rinse and repeat until he gets it.", "NTA!!!!!", "Whole house full of assholes, but you are not one of them.", "NTA. These folks expected you to be a free babysitter for this kid and then wouldn't clean up the vomit, which stains and sets into the carpet and fabric if not cleaned quickly. I guess they wanted you to clean that, too. Sounds like these people shouldn't be invited back in the future since they can't follow clear boundaries (like not making you the babysitter.)", "NTA. You had an agreement he did not respect it and also ignored you and snapped at you when you asked him if they cleaned up after the kid. You are not a babysitter for your BIL. If he wants the 8yo with him he needs to take care of him.", "ESH - I gotta start off first by saying that if you have expectations between you and your husband that you've discussed before, it's not clear in the OP.  So I don't know what the typical visit is like other than they go fish and the crappy 9 year old.\n\nBut obviously there's not much you can do about the 9yo and your hubs and BIL go fishing frequently if not every time they visit.  so you sorta don't have much ground to complain about that except maybe the frequency of which they go fishing and leave you \"to babysit\" as you put it.\n\nOn the other hand, any husband worth his weight in salt couldn't be so blind as to not see that he's leaving all the kids with you and basically have you take care of them.  My wife would have her foot up my ass so fast we'd have to go to the hospital to have it surgically removed.\n\nMIL, there's not much you can say about the generation, by my mom and wife's mom are the same.  The man \"runs the house and does what he wants and we basically do everything he doesn't want to do\" types.  When they say that kinda shit, we just shrug it off and say \"that's your marriage, not ours, so deal with it.\"  \n\nBest advice here is to agree as to what and when they visit and between you and your husband, who's responsible for what, (i.e. your allowed to fish once and gotta keep it under X hours, you go twice, I'm taking the kids and we're getting a hotel).  Whatever it is.  Agree beforehand, so there's no blindsiding one another.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly speak to both of them how you feel and if they say you\u2019re dramatic just do what they do and disappear for hours, your BIL\u2019s grandson is not your responsibility", "NTA. They shouldn't be invited back. And if they are and have that kid, leave immediately.", "NTA\n\nWhen you have houses guests staying over, there really ought to be some equal consideration made towards effort put in to tend to them. It's not fair that you're basically having to take care of 3 children and an old woman", "I agree. I'm still at the hotel but we did talk on the phone and he did tell his mom he doesn't like what she said to me.", "1.

I don't come back from fishing when we are getting bites or someone just caught something. I would be out for hours too but I wish they would have taken the kid at least sometimes. They didn't want him in the boat. The only expectation I set with my husband is that they take the kid with them and not leave him with me. They can fish as long as they want, as much as they want but don't leave me with the kid.", "I am glad you two are communicating. Just remember that him agreeing that his mom was out of line is not the same thing as him taking responsibility for his role in how this whole situation played out. \n\nBecause the conflict between you and his mom would never have happened if he had 1) set firmer boundaries with his brother about bringing the grandson to visit; 2) properly cleaned up the vomit the first time; and 3) not gone fishing leaving you to deal with stress/work of having guests.", ">Hotels are not convenient for my MIL with her medical machine set up and mobility issues.  \n>  \n>Actually that night my BIL cleaned the vomit but the next morning he was MIA so I asked my husband to do it.\n\nBoth answers make sense. You're definitely NTA, but I also understand your husband wanting family to visit, and from the sound of it MIL couldn't make the trip alone.\n\nMaybe getting a hotel room is just something you all need to do from now on when they visit just to keep the peace. I am cool with cramming people into beds, couches, etc, especially when everyone is family. But 1 bathroom for 6 or 7 people including children and a grandparent with health problems...that just sounds like a nightmare.\n\nMaybe you all could start visiting them instead of them coming to you as well. I have no idea if this is feasible or not, but I would try your best to be compassionate with your husband. It sounds like he is trying to spend what could be very limited time he has left with his mother. Just don't let that compassion cost you your own health and sanity.\n\nGood luck, you sound like a good spouse and mother i hope you all come up with a solution!", "NTA, at all.  These people needed to learn a lesson, and you taught them.  Also tell MIL that this is not 1823 and women do not \"stay home\".  I would leave every time BIL and this kid visit in the future.", "NTA.  Your husband is a big ass", "NTA- you have a husband problem .\n\nHe\u2019s allowing his guests to treat you like a live in nanny.\n\nStay at the hotel .", "NTA - but that poor kid...", "NTA. And good for you!", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA\u2026 F* your husband and his brother and their nice vacation", "NTA- grandma/MIL needs to return to the 50's life's not like that anymore. It sounds like BIL is using his visiting time to get away from his kid instead of spending time with him. I would put my foot down and let my husband know that next time either they get a hotel or I would and that visiting time ends when he leaves to go somewhere else, that they will not be abandoning his mom and the kid with me. I would also set a visiting time no earlier than X no later than Y. 30 minutes before that time, start packing things up for them and telling the kids, say goodnight to grandma.", "NTA", ">She also told me I wasn't raised this way and that men go out and women stay home.\n\n\nBull fucking shit. NTA and good for you. You keep right on polishing that strong, shiny spine. MIL is an asshole with internalized misogyny, hubby & BIL didn't fall far from the tree. \n\nIt's time to start saying no to more than one person or couple staying at a time and to turn away any guests of a guest. If hubby insists, even though this should be a 2 yes, 1 no decision, book that hotel. And maybe an appointment with a lawyer.", "YTA. Instead of you leaving, you should have just kicked everyone out.", "NTA, though your MIL explained why the \u201cmen\u201d behave like that.", "NTA Everyone else in your post is though. Proud of you for leaving. Good job.", "NTA Sounds like everyone enjoys themselves except you. For HIS family's vacation. Screw that. Hubby can deal with them and the place better be clean when you get back.", "No more visits and your MIL told you that you weren't raised this way? Did your MIL raise you? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nEverybody else is - your BIL, your husband, and MIL.\n\nYou are not the unpaid babysitter, and no, men \"don't go out and the women stay home.\"\n\nThat's outdated and sexist.\n\nWhy was this \"unofficial grandson\" brought along anyway?  \n\nGoing to a motel was the best thing you could have done.  It forces the mean enablers in your family to see things through somebody besides their own selfish lenses.", "right. and OP will *meet* them for dinner. end of statement", "I know I'm just not equipped for him. I played hide and seek with him, we made pancakes together, cookies together, let him play video games, gave him art supplies. He needs constant attention and stimulation and I was overwhelmed. I also felt like the men did not take his stomach ache seriously. We of course told him it was okay and not to worry about the mess. He was throwing things at my daughter and grabbing her stuff and having fits from the moment he arrived. He was expelled from his elementary  school. Fighting with my son. Couldn't do more than I did and it was unfair for me.", "If MIL was not so disabled and there was not a kid involved I may have. But this way it was a private convo with my husband and BIL and I'm sure they told the kid an excuse for leaving early.", "So funny you said that, I told everyone I was taking my kids out for the day and did come back for dinner with family. The plan was to hang out and excuse ourselves at bed time stating that I need a good night sleep and booked a hotel. Husband and I obviously have MIL our bed and we were on an air mattress. However, after some upsetting comments from my MIL I left right after dinner. BIL was at Walmart with the boy so no feelings were hurt hopefully.", "He may not like her words, but he certainly seems to be living by them. A little introspection would do him some good.", "Listen OP, you must get real with your hubby, because this might be getting too much for you and your relationship very soon. I mean, if he can't help take care of his own family, what evidence says he is ready to support you and your kid?", "He doesn't like what she said but his own behavior is a bigger problem. It seems like an easy cop out to deflect blame on his mother for the situation instead of addressing his crappy behavior.", "Why isn't a 9 year old boy fishing and shooting with the men.  That sounds odd", "Why are they not taking the kids fishing with them? Maybe some are too young but the 9 year old could definitely go. I was taking my kids fishing when my youngest was 4. I guess I didn't really do much fishing myself but the kids had fun.", "Let the feelings be hurt. The kid sounds like a menace and the BIL seems to just ignore it. Nothing will ever change if it's never brought to their attention.", "Did he even talk to his mother or just say he did. Sounds like he fully expected his wife to go full 1950s housewife the whole visit", "Kids*", "Well, apparently they got in a fight and the family packed up early.  I'm checking out of hotel tomorrow. Husband is home shampooing carpet."]}
