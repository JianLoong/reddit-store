However, my brother in law decided to bring his unofficial grandson along from Saturday to Monday. I agreed to this but then he said he will actually be staying till Wednesday. This boy is 9 with behavioral issues and I can only take him in small doses as he is difficult and does not get along with my kids. Every time he brings this kid I do my best but tell hubby not to leave me as babysitter. He \"forgets\" this each visit and goes out fishing and shooting with his brother for hours multiple times per day. My MIL is very weak and can barely get around or make a snack so she is also high maintenance. I don't mind helping her at all. Sunday night after gorging on junk food all day the boy was crying on the couch to my BIL about his tummy who ignored him and sure enough he began to vomit all over my living room. I got up and went to sleep in my kid's room and texted my husband to get home now and clean up. The next morning on the way to the bathroom I see vomit stains on the floor and alerted my husband who cleaned up. Then, instead of making sure they didn't miss anything else in the light of day and making sure the boy was okay the men went fishing for 3 hours. I stayed in bed and my MIL did not feed the boy. When the men came home I asked my husband if he checked the pillows and blankets on the couch for vomit but he snapped at me. After that, I got a hotel and my kids and I left. My MIL told me I was being dramatic and I was not in charge of the boy as she was there even though she can't take care of herself.

If he is not willing to discuss this with you and make serious changes to how guests are managed going forward - you have a much bigger problem than vomit stains.", "NTA\n\nBIL is just using you as a babysitter for his grandson. Your husband needs to put a stop to that. Tell him no hunting and fishing if grandson is there - unless they take him with them.", "NTA. I read the whole thing and still think its a NTA, but I could have stopped after the part where you said BIL brought his 9 year old kid with behavioral issues, unannounced. That is not okay, especially given your living situation.\n\nI am curious for more INFO though, not to change my ruling just out of curiosity.\n\n1. Why don't your BIL and MIL stay at a hotel while visiting?\n2. Why did you make your husband clean up the kid's mess. Why is BIL not the one cleaning that mess up?", ">She also told me I wasn't raised this way and that men go out and women stay home. \n\nShe's correct.  You weren't raised with a sexist attitude.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You are being treated like an unpaid babysitter and maid. Your husband is not \"forgetting\" he is choosing to treat you that way. Stand your ground. Everytime the inlaws \"visit\". leave. If your kids are a bit older...leave them with daddy and you go get some relaxation. Rinse and repeat until he gets it.", "NTA!!!!!", "Whole house full of assholes, but you are not one of them.", "NTA. These folks expected you to be a free babysitter for this kid and then wouldn't clean up the vomit, which stains and sets into the carpet and fabric if not cleaned quickly. I guess they wanted you to clean that, too. Sounds like these people shouldn't be invited back in the future since they can't follow clear boundaries (like not making you the babysitter.)", "NTA. You had an agreement he did not respect it and also ignored you and snapped at you when you asked him if they cleaned up after the kid. You are not a babysitter for your BIL. If he wants the 8yo with him he needs to take care of him.", "ESH - I gotta start off first by saying that if you have expectations between you and your husband that you've discussed before, it's not clear in the OP.  So I don't know what the typical visit is like other than they go fish and the crappy 9 year old.\n\nBut obviously there's not much you can do about the 9yo and your hubs and BIL go fishing frequently if not every time they visit.  so you sorta don't have much ground to complain about that except maybe the frequency of which they go fishing and leave you \"to babysit\" as you put it.\n\nOn the other hand, any husband worth his weight in salt couldn't be so blind as to not see that he's leaving all the kids with you and basically have you take care of them.  My wife would have her foot up my ass so fast we'd have to go to the hospital to have it surgically removed.\n\nMIL, there's not much you can say about the generation, by my mom and wife's mom are the same.  The man \"runs the house and does what he wants and we basically do everything he doesn't want to do\" types.  When they say that kinda shit, we just shrug it off and say \"that's your marriage, not ours, so deal with it.\"  \n\nBest advice here is to agree as to what and when they visit and between you and your husband, who's responsible for what, (i.e. your allowed to fish once and gotta keep it under X hours, you go twice, I'm taking the kids and we're getting a hotel).  Whatever it is.  Agree beforehand, so there's no blindsiding one another.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They can fish as long as they want, as much as they want but don't leave me with the kid.", "I am glad you two are communicating. Just remember that him agreeing that his mom was out of line is not the same thing as him taking responsibility for his role in how this whole situation played out. \n\nBecause the conflict between you and his mom would never have happened if he had 1) set firmer boundaries with his brother about bringing the grandson to visit; 2) properly cleaned up the vomit the first time; and 3) not gone fishing leaving you to deal with stress/work of having guests.", ">Hotels are not convenient for my MIL with her medical machine set up and mobility issues.  \n>  \n>Actually that night my BIL cleaned the vomit but the next morning he was MIA so I asked my husband to do it.\n\nBoth answers make sense. You're definitely NTA, but I also understand your husband wanting family to visit, and from the sound of it MIL couldn't make the trip alone.\n\nMaybe getting a hotel room is just something you all need to do from now on when they visit just to keep the peace. I am cool with cramming people into beds, couches, etc, especially when everyone is family. But 1 bathroom for 6 or 7 people including children and a grandparent with health problems...that just sounds like a nightmare.\n\nMaybe you all could start visiting them instead of them coming to you as well. I have no idea if this is feasible or not, but I would try your best to be compassionate with your husband. It sounds like he is trying to spend what could be very limited time he has left with his mother. Just don't let that compassion cost you your own health and sanity.\n\nGood luck, you sound like a good spouse and mother i hope you all come up with a solution!"]}
