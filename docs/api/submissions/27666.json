You wouldn't see an advertisement for 'boys and men' where 'boys' means '20 year old male.'\n\nSo while the term girls is not terrible to use all of the time in all contexts, it was used extensively (and is still used fairly often) in contexts where we would not use 'boy' or 'boys.' Like someone such as OP who is probably a middle-aged man referring to an intern (so 19-22) as a 'girl,' would be way less likely to refer to a 19-22 male as a boy. And it isn't just that OP sees her as a girl, it's that she's the only 'girl' in the office, but would he say that if there was a 30-year old woman there? If it's because of her age, wouldn't she still be the only 'girl' if there were older women there? No, the rest of the office is 'male.' So there are 'males' and 'only one girl' in the office. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's intentional, sexist, blah blah blah. It's just recognizing this stuff can be important.
