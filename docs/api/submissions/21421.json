However there was one boy in my class I used to pick on/bully on a regular basis. I won\u2019t go into details as to why as that\u2019s irrelevant to the overall post. When we graduated I never saw him again. \n\nWell last month I went to a friend\u2019s birthday party and to my shock he was there. Initially I did NOT recognize him, but when someone said his name I started to put the pieces together. Not only was his personality entirely different, he was shockingly attractive too. \n\nI went up to him to chat and his demeanour changed instantly. He closed off, spoke less and made little to no eye contact. I tried to keep the convo going but it was like pulling teeth. I did apologize as I felt that\u2019s what he was waiting for. But he didn\u2019t really respond to the apology\u2026at least not in the way I expected. I jokingly said that I won\u2019t beg for his forgiveness forever and that he also can\u2019t hate me forever. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t paying attention so I decided to put this entire drama to an end. I grabbed the karaoke mic and publicly apologized to him at the party. I said that I\u2019m truly sorry for how I made him feel in high school and that I was a stupid, mean bully. I also said that I\u2019m totally down to hang out whenever he wants so he can move past his hurt. \n\nI actually got cheers so thought I did a good thing. However he was angry and asked to speak in private. He basically called me a \u201cfucking moron\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d. We started arguing and I told him that a public apology was really the only way to get things going. He called me a selfish, attention-seeking asshole who can\u2019t take no for an answer. \n\nSo am I truly the asshole here? I read somewhere that \u2018putting things out there\u2019 is the best way to heal/get over things.", "created_utc": 1688580562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rijd0/aita_for_publicly_apologizing_to_the_kid_i_used/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get over yourself.", "Oh man, the bully grew up into.... an adult bully. YTA. \n\n1. It sounds like your 1:1 apology was extremely inconsiderate and impatient if by the end of the conversation you were saying 'you can't hate me forever'. Girl, you aren't even in his life. He can absolutely hate you forever if he wants, and a one-time, half-baked apology that you are trying to cram down his throat is hardly going to be an assurance of your kindness. \n2. THEN - omg THEN - you decide because he 'isn't paying attention' (to you) that you're going to make a public spectacle? Can you even imagine how he sees you at this point? Just, unbelievably toxic and shitty. \n\nGotta say I love the 'down to hang out' like you think you're gonna start dating this guy just because he's become attractive. You should take your ego down a few pegs, but more importantly, please learn how to respect boundaries, how to read a room, and that REALLY taking responsibility for past actions does not involve re-victimizing your victim. Such an AH.", "YTA: YOU LITERALLY TRIED TO BULLY HIM  into excepting your apology with peer pressure and to fix YOUR guilt you forced yourself into a conversation with a guy who clearly wanted nothing to do with you and then your ego got the best of you and you wanted to publicly announce something he clearly didn\u2019t want public. Yeah he can hate you forever cause look at your behavior. You don\u2019t deserve his forgiveness nor does he have to except your apology. You clearly haven\u2019t grown up and I find your first sentence very wrong cause a pretty well behaved student doesn\u2019t bully others.\n\nYou cant take rejection obviously and that\u2019s what you felt, guilt and rejection. You don\u2019t deserve to talk to him. If he wanted tot all to you, he would\u2019ve. This isn\u2019t about him at all, you made it all about you. You\u2019re not the victim here. Also putting out there doesn\u2019t mean publicly in front of others, it means stating the facts, admitting everything you did to him in a conversation. But that\u2019s only if he wants it and clearly he didn\u2019t.", "YTA. That was attention seeking and selfish. You apologized for YOU. Not for him. You only considered what would make you feel better. You clearly caught that he didn\u2019t want to talk to you but kept on going. He actually can hate you forever.", "YTA\n\nHe was not and never will be obliged to accept your apology or to give you the opportunity to redeem yourself with friendship or whatever the heck you were trying for here. \n\nYou standing up and speaking about him in public like that was performative BS and absolutely not what was best for him. It was about you. Again. \n\nYou already victimised him at school.\n\nDon't repeat it all over again because you think you deserve forgiveness or that he \"should\" react to your apology in the way you want him to.", "YTA for the public display. Now he has to answer questions from others at the party as to how you tormented him in high school. Pointing out that he\u2019s suddenly attractive makes me think you are only apologizing because you think he\u2019s hot and that makes him worth apologizing to\u2014sounds very superficial of you. If he looked like a troll, would you apologize or bully him more? Joking that you \u201cwon\u2019t beg for his forgiveness forever\u201d sounds like an insincere apology as well and that you feel entitled to his forgiveness.", "YTA. For one thing, you didn't even apologize because it was the right thing to do. You did it because you happened to be in the same place and it would have been awkward not to address it. **If you were genuinely sorry you would have sought him out instead of waiting for a chance run-in**\n\nBut once you were in that moment, apologizing privately was the right thing to do. Then you should have let it go. Let him process it however he sees fit. **\"He also can\u2019t hate me forever.\" Yes he fucking can if he wants to.** Apologizing publicly after already doing it privately was nothing but an attempt to pressure him into apologizing. **You just wanted absolution from your sins, even if you were pressuring him into giving it. Well he doesn't have to.**\n\nAll you managed to do with that public apology was bully him a little more", "YTA. The only reason you were interested is because he was suddenly attractive to you. He had the right of it. You're still a bully and an egotistical moron on top of it. If I could I would give him a standing ovation.", "YTA: no one is obligated to accept an apology. And when this person clearly didn\u2019t want to talk to you further, you made a spectacle of him in front of a lot of people. It sounds like you were apologizing for selfish reasons (you want to feel better, you think he\u2019s attractive now and don\u2019t want him to think less of you, etc), and not because you have genuine remorse for your behavior. It sounds like you\u2019re still a bully.", "I\u2019m having a hard time believing this, people literally clapped like some dumb rom-com, did the DJ put on the perfect song for the situation too, you sung it flawlessly and everyone else broke into synchronized choreography too?\n\nIn the off chance this really happened, YTA - he is correct, you didn\u2019t apologize for his sake, you did it for your own selfish reasons.", ">He called me a selfish, attention-seeking asshole who can\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nYeah, that seems pretty accurate. He doesn't owe you forgiveness. He doesn't owe you attention. He absolutely can resent the way you treated him forever. You don't get to dictate the terms at which he deals with the trauma you inflicted.\n\nYTA, obviously.", "YTA  . he is absolutelly right! I can't believe you are 27 years old, you  are more immature than a kindergardener.", "You come across as narcissistic. He is right, you haven't changed at all. YTA.", "YTA you traumatized the dude and you randomly showing up was immediately triggering, hence the lack of response. Some people just arent gonna forgive you, and he absolutely can hold that against you forever, its up to him whether he thinks youve done the work beyond just an apology, and honestly with the way you forced one on him to help yourself feel better shows you havent IMO", "YTA you're an asshole and still a bully", "He doesn't want to sleep with you. YTA, you desperate weirdo.", "YTA, way to put him on the spot. You did that so YOU could feel good, not for his benefit. Super selfish of you and obvious it was for the wrong reasons.", "sounds like the detials on why you still bully him must be relevant as you started bullying him the very moment you realized who he was  \n\n\nYTA", "Yeah. YTA - this wasn't you trying to make him feel better; it was all about you trying to make yourself feel better.", "YTA.  He is right - you are still only thinking about yourself.  He's obviously not ready to engage you on this, how did you think he would react to your little mike stunt?", "YTA you are clearly not actually sorry because if you were, you would take his feeling into consideration but you only thought about being forgiven and being able to talk to him now that you are attracted to him. He is allowed to hate you forever if he wants, and you embarrassing him in front of people isn't going to change that. You tried to force forgiveness that you clearly don't deserve.", "YTA\n\nYou apologizing privately was a good thing to do. But he is in no way under the obligation to accept it.\n\nYet, you couldn't accept it and decided to go on a public display... you basically bullied him into your apology...", "\"Not only was his personality entirely different, he was shockingly attractive too... \n\n...I jokingly said that I won\u2019t beg for his forgiveness forever and that he also can\u2019t hate me forever...\n\n...I actually got cheers so thought I did a good thing....\n\n...I read somewhere that \u2018putting things out there\u2019 is the best way to heal/get over things...\"\n\nCongratulations, your ego is a bestseller. Go you. YTA.", "YTA. You can't force someone to forgive you and stop being mad a you. And making a scene out of it so you get some personal attention ? My guess is that your are a narcissist.", "YTA. For so many reasons. Besides the fact that you are a bully, you seem to think you are entitled to forgiveness in this situation. His demeanor changed because you bullied him and traumatized him, I doubt he has forgotten. And then to publicly draw more attention to a situation he probably doesn\u2019t want to discuss? He is right. You are an attention seeking AH.", "YTA. You bullied him in high school and now you bullied him as an adult trying to force him to accept your apology. That's truly terrible. Do better.", "This cannot be real. YTA", "Yep, YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you only felt remorse because you now find him attractive. \n\nYou didn't respond to his cues that he wasn't interested in talking to you. \n\nBy making a public so-called apology you reminded everyone in the room about a part of his past life that likely causes pain and embarrassment. You got the crowd on your side, which is often how bullying works in the first place, and you pressured  him to be friendly with you for the sake of your own ego. \n\nThis is the opposite of making it right. Do better please.", "YTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like you actually treated your peers all that well in high school. He doesn\u2019t have to forgive you. If he wasn\u2019t engaging in your private apology it should\u2019ve ended there. Putting him on blast at the party was incredibly selfish/self-serving of you. \n\nSomeone doesn\u2019t like you because of the way YOU treated them and that\u2019s YOUR fault. Live with it.", ">When we graduated I never saw him again\n\nFirst off, since you did, in fact, see him again, please don't say this. Especially at your advanced age of 27. \n\nYTA, unequivocally.\n\nYou were NOT a well-behaved student who treated their peers well. You were mean and a bully and an AH.\n\nSeveral years later, but no less of an AH, the only reason you were interested  in apologizing was because he was \"shockingly attractive.\" You, the oblivious AH, go up to the person you bullied in high school and seem surprised that he wasn't overjoyed to see you. Continuing along in your self-centeredness, you don't take the pretty obvious hint that he didn't want to talk to you, and gave your completely meaningless \"apology\", and then he didn't \"react the way (you) expected.\" Of course not. You probably expected accolades and a hookup.\n\nThen you decide to ramp it up, although you claim to think that GRABBING THE MIC would\n\n>put this entire drama to an end\n\nand proceeded to shine a big ol' spotlight on poor bullied guy and our star, Ms. AH. The cheers you got would have been from other people who were bullies in hs who think it's water under the proverbial bridge. \n\nBullied guy nailed it with every word he said to you. You wanted what you wanted, and you wanted it RIGHT THEN, so you BULLIED HIM to try to get him to accept your apology. \n\nYTA YTA YTA\n\nIF you ever see this guy again, leave him the hell alone. \n\n(and yes, he CAN and likely WILL hate you forever)", "YTA. And just a heads up, an offer to your victim to \u201chang out anytime\u201d is not the blessing you seem to think it is.", "YTA, I bet you your public apology was taken as sarcastic and picking on him again.  Would you have apologized if he wasn't \"shockingly attractive?\"  You also sound really self centered", "YTA - WOW, so much wow.  Don't ever contact or engage your victim ever again.\n\nYou don't know yourself as well as you think you do.  Time for years of self-reflection and throw in research of the effects of bullying, abuse and violence on the victims.  Did I say Wow?", "YTA he doesn\u2019t have to accept your apology cause he got hot. You need to grow up and realize you aren\u2019t the main character", "YTA \n\nJesus Christ you're clueless and your motive is completely transparent. You're the most unfuckable person in the world to him. Why TF did you think he might want anything to do with you? He doesn't have to forgive you. You proved you don't deserve it when you got on the mic.", "\u201cHe can\u2019t hate me forever\u201d\ud83d\ude02yes he can , why do bullies always expect forgiveness. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have been an ass in the first place", "YTA - you made this all about you. You publicly humiliated him at a party! You really need to do some soul searching here about why you CONTINUE TO BULLY this person", "YTA\n\n>He called me a selfish, attention-seeking asshole who can\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nMe: This wreaks of main character syndrome.  He didn't want an apology, he wanted you to leave him alone.  And he has \"moved past his hurt\" and put up boundaries that you completely ignored, which were \"leave me alone/don't talk to me.\"", "YTA\n\nWowww\u2026if the apology was truly for him you should\u2019ve been ok with the fact that he didn\u2019t want to accept it or spend time with you. Also, you probably made him really uncomfortable by publicly announcing this. Clearly this BS \u201capology\u201d was only for you because now he\u2019s attractive and confident and you wouldn\u2019t mind \u201changing out\u201d with him. Also, you\u2019re not a nice person who treats people well, that very obvious from this post. You\u2019re selfish bully who employs peer pressure to get what you want and clearly that hasn\u2019t changed since high school.", "YTA - You victimized him again by \"apologizing\" to him in front of everybody. He's 100% right, and nobody owes you forgiveness. Just sounds like you are still a bully.", "YTA\n\nLeave him alone.\nYou apologised. Then you publicly embarrassed him and made the apology about you. \nHE decides whether to accept your apology.  You don't get to bully him into it.", "YTA. You made him miserable in school. That leaves a scar and it won't go away even if you apologize. You're acting like it was no big deal and he should now want to go out with you because you think he's suddenly cute? I'm disgusted.\n\nHe wasn't ready to forgive you and you should have left it to that. You humiliated him with that stunt you pulled. What kind of a person does that? This feels like a really bad teenage movie.", "YTA. \"Im sorry\" isn't some magic spell that makes someone instantly forgive you. He does not have to forgive you.

You don't get to choose whether he accepts your apology or not. You don't get to decide if he wants a conversation of any type with you. His actions and body language should have clued you in that he wants nothing to do with you. And yet,\n\n>He called me a selfish, attention-seeking asshole who can\u2019t take no for an answer. \n\nSeems like he painted a pretty accurate picture.", "YTA. It was one thing to go and apologize, but then you said you weren\u2019t going to beg for his forgiveness forever. At that point you gave away your motivation: you didn\u2019t do this to make things up for him, you did this entirely to make yourself feel virtuous. If you really were trying to make good, you would of apologized and left - being forgiven would not have mattered to you. \n\nAnd then, to top it off, you grabbed a microphone and made it public so that you could bask in the glow of public praise, ignoring the fact that you just embarrassed the poor guy. And then you said you were willing to hang out - as if your friendship were some kind of reward. \n\nCongratulations, you took this whole situation and made it all about you as opposed to actually making up for any past hurt. \n\nAssuming you are actually trying to improve yourself, the way to do this is, if you want to make up for past bullying, you apologize and then walk away. You also realize that you are not entitled to any sort of forgiveness. You simply put the apology out there and leave. And you do it privately. \n\nExcept for this one guy. You have messed this one up beyond repair. Leave him alone.", "YTA. He didn\u2019t want to talk to you. You picked on him before. What made you think that he wanted to talk to you after one apology?

I read you're on a self-healing journey so apologizing makes sense...but not leaving it alone and implying he can't heal unless he forgives you/wants to buddy up with you doesn't. Self-healing should be about *you*, not how other people feel about you. \n\nYour public apology is self congratulatory. You're painting yourself as the person who is above and beyond who the were in highschool and is implying he's not. And that you alone can help him heal. You're also bringing up whatever shitty things you said about him in HS. \n\nTake this as a lesson. Don't beat yourself up about it. Learn and move on.

However there was one boy in my class I used to pick on/bully on a regular basis. I won\u2019t go into details as to why as that\u2019s irrelevant to the overall post. When we graduated I never saw him again. \n\nWell last month I went to a friend\u2019s birthday party and to my shock he was there. Initially I did NOT recognize him, but when someone said his name I started to put the pieces together. Not only was his personality entirely different, he was shockingly attractive too. \n\nI went up to him to chat and his demeanour changed instantly. He closed off, spoke less and made little to no eye contact. I tried to keep the convo going but it was like pulling teeth. I did apologize as I felt that\u2019s what he was waiting for. But he didn\u2019t really respond to the apology\u2026at least not in the way I expected. I jokingly said that I won\u2019t beg for his forgiveness forever and that he also can\u2019t hate me forever. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t paying attention so I decided to put this entire drama to an end. I grabbed the karaoke mic and publicly apologized to him at the party. I said that I\u2019m truly sorry for how I made him feel in high school and that I was a stupid, mean bully. I also said that I\u2019m totally down to hang out whenever he wants so he can move past his hurt. \n\nI actually got cheers so thought I did a good thing. However he was angry and asked to speak in private. He basically called me a \u201cfucking moron\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d. We started arguing and I told him that a public apology was really the only way to get things going. He called me a selfish, attention-seeking asshole who can\u2019t take no for an answer. \n\nSo am I truly the asshole here? I read somewhere that \u2018putting things out there\u2019 is the best way to heal/get over things.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
