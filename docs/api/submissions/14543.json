{"id": 14543, "submission_id": "12ipj9q", "title": "AITA for bringing my ex to court for supervised visitation over what he said to our daughter?", "selftext": "This is a tough one and I'm in a bad spot. A lot of people won't see the problem with what he said and honestly, in different circumstances it may have been okay. But my daughter has Autism and becomes fixated or obsessed with things and is so easily persuaded and confused and he knows this. We split up in 2016 and in 2018 he basically fell off the planet. He sees our two kids maybe once every 4 months and only when his mother takes them. I have no issues with him seeing the kids when they are there despite him being an absent father but this incident truly has set shit off for me and I've filed paperwork for supervised visits for my daughters mental being. There is currently no order in place and he doesn't pay support either. \n\nSo our daughter is 9 and as I said, she has pretty severe Autism. She absolutely gets fixated and obsessed with things and if she can't understand it, she lashes out BAD. She saw her father this past weekend and when she got home she was just pissed at the world and I couldn't pinpoint the trigger because she hadn't been here. I finally got her to open up to me about two hours later and at this point she is full on hysterical. Crying, getting frustrated, yelling, etc. Prior to this her brother (12) gave me a bit of a run down and said something about their father telling our daughter that it was okay if she transitioned if she felt she were a boy and that he would accept her no matter what. This confused my daughter, who is now questioning whether she is a boy because she doesn't like dresses or heels. Which is apparently why her dad brought it up to begin with (she didn't want to wear an easter dress and short heels for their dinner over there). So now she has a million questions, asking me if she is a boy now because her dad thinks she is and if she was is meant to be a boy and if she has to cut her hair short and start wearing boy clothes now and if that means her favorite color can't be pink anymore and whatever else. She truly was hysterical and so fucking confused simply because her father put it in her head that she's more of a boy than a girl because she doesn't like dresses. \n\nI was hoping she wouldn't fixate on it but I was wrong. She doesn't want to go to school now because \"what if my friends know I'm a boy but I think I'm a girl and they laugh at me\". Or \"what if people think I'm weird for going to school in girl clothes?\" She NEVER questioned this shit before. As I said, she simply doesn't like dresses and heels (sensory). She likes being covered and she wears jeans/sweats and baggy tees/sweaters. Her comfort zone. But it's causing a shit load of issues so I filed paperwork and told their grandmother they would not be going back over there with their father present until I got a court order for supervision and gave her the run down. She's saying I'm fucking ignorant and denying them time with their grandchildren over a \"innocent comment\" and that I'm \"milking the autism and using it as an excuse to stop contact\". AITA?\n\nETA: this wasn't him being a \"loving and supportive father\". This was him being misogynistic and saying she was clearly a boy since she doesn't like wearing dresses or heels. My son blatantly told me that he sat my child down for over a half hour saying she was clearly a boy since she wasn't his definition of girly. He used to pull the same shit on me when I was with him. He told her not even last year that he would disown her if she came out as gay because she said she thought her best friend Madison was beautiful. He wasn't being \"a loving father\". Anyone who has dealt with emotional abuse can see through the blurred lines here and for those of you whom haven't, consider yourself lucky.", "created_utc": 1681231232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ipj9q/aita_for_bringing_my_ex_to_court_for_supervised/", "score": 327, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not about being accepting of trans and those of you who think it is are completely missing the point here. This is about an absent father trying to tell his daughter who is more comfortable in jeans and sneakers that because she doesn't want to wear a dress and heels, she is probably a boy. \n\nAs a lifelong \"tomboy\" I'm glad my dad never told me that I wasn't a girl. Maybe that's because my dad was actually present in my life and actually knew me and if your ex was actually present in your daughter's life, he would have known how a comment like that would affect her. \n\nThis is WAY different than your daughter saying she feels she may be trans and him being accepting. This is him planting insecurity and paranoia in the mind of his child who already struggles with those issues because of her autism and you are NEVER TA for protecting your child!", "Reading the edit (which is very important): NTA\n\nHe is causing your child huge amounts of stress because she doesn't fit his idea of femininity. Which is ridiculous and harmful. Add in he has a history of these \"comments\", one of them being he'd disown her if she was gay, I'd also file for supervised visits.", "This is above reddit's pay grade! You are never the asshole for having your children's best interests at heart. You seem like a reliable narrator so I'm going to believe you over the grandmother. But your daughter definitely needs some therapy about this.", "NTA\n\nWhat your ex said was simply cruel, autism or not. He wasn\u2019t happy with your daughter not wanting to wear her Easter clothes so he took a swipe at her. That kind of jab would hurt most girls\u2019 feelings. \n\nUnfortunately, by asking for supervised visitation you are also punishing the grandparents, but since that is the only place he sees the kids, there is probably not a way around it.", "Nta. That poor girl.  What your ex said to your daughter, considering the circumstances, is despicable.  My bio father was just as bad.  A father manipulating his kid is evil. Keep on taking notes, maybe have your daughter see a therapist, but only if they actually understand the situation.  \n\n\nAlso, what the hell happened to being a tomboy?!  Not liking high heels or wearing dresses doesn't mean that she isn't a girl. It just mean that she doesn't like those things.  I saw a post on Pinterest that said something like \"Adding myself to the growing amount of women who are revealing to be a tomboy as a child, and a women today. To think that my 10 year old self would be considered trans is terrifying\" and honestly, that's the truth.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nKnowing your daughter's Autism, that comment was beyond idiotic. Also, not liking \"girly\" (as defined at present day in a given culture) stuff does not mean that a girl doesn't consider herself a girl. \n\nIt is hard to say what court will do. But the very fact of being dragged into family court over this will make your ex think twice about what he says.", "NTA", "NTA. Who the fuck wants their 9 year old wearing heels anyway?! This is going to take a lot of work and therapy for your daughter to get through, and may cause her lasting damage for life. This man doesn\u2019t deserve the title father.

And that's my opinion as an autistic woman who had the identity crisis as a teenager.\n\nYour ex-husband sat his nine year old child down for half an hour telling her she must be trans because she doesn't like dresses or heels. While he might have said he'll accept her, he's not actually being loving and supportive. *He decided her identity for her based off of his own misogyny*. That's not loving and supportive.\n\nAnd it caused your daughter distress.\n\nYour daughter's therapist identifies your ex as a \"negative trigger\" because he has a habit of saying things that distress her.\n\nYou should absolutely tell your daughter there's nothing wrong with being trans and that you'll still love and support her if she is, but also assure her that her father doesn't decide that for her.\n\nAnd I agree that supervised visitation might be a good idea because someone has to protect your daughter from your ex.\n\nYou're not transphobic and your ex isn't an ally because if he was he wouldn't be *dictating a nine-year-old's identity to her*.\n\n(I'm sure you and your son have accidentally sent your daughter into episodes like this before, but it's still not the same situation.)", "NTA. if your ex was more present in your child's life, you could tell him this is the problem you created, now you fix it. but since he only sees them once every four months, it's not likely another one will come up again between now and when you can get the court to say his visits need to be supervised.\n\nall you're saying is that he doesn't know how to handle her by himself, so someone else should be there, and that's not unreasonable. maybe he can learn and improve and then he won't need it anymore, but when he brings them back you're the one dealing with the fallout of their interaction.", "Someone who shows up every few months and doesn\u2019t even pay support can barely call themselves a parent.

Even **if** he did mean his comments with the best of intentions, his past word and actions have shown his kids that he cannot be trusted, so of course they would not give him the benefit of the doubt. He already burned that bridge.", "NTA - you feel the need to protect your child.", "info: What does your kids therapist have to say about this newfound confusion???", "Omg your NTA in anyway, I hope you can help your daughter get through this.", "So the story is this:  \n\n\n1- the father expressed that he would be supportive IF she were trans\n\n2- this made the autistic girl lose her mind and get so confused\n\n3- we have to keep the idea of being trans, or the concept that it's okay to be trans, away from children because it'll \"confuse\", upset, and ruin their lives. The courts should enforce this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm calling huge, transphobic drivel of a BS story here.

I would say OP is NTA for feeling this way since the dad already only sees the kids every 4 months and only bc the grandma has them\u2026 it kinda seems like he doesn\u2019t want to see them anyways. But idk the whole situation so\u2026 plus op said there\u2019s been other situations that have caused problems. And that comment might seem innocent but the kid took it to heart and made her overthink.

Yeah. YTA.", "NTA since he's an absent father.

Is there a reason that you can\u2019t just talk to your ex and explain that she can blow things out of proportion? What you\u2019re doing is drastic and seems like throwing gasoline on a fire. If you really don\u2019t want the kids to have contact with their dad, then this is the way to go cuz he\u2019ll throw up his hands and walk away. But keep in mind, one day they\u2019re going to find out that your overreaction prevented them from seeing him and they will resent you. \u201cHoney, he made this comment when you were nine and you got upset, so I went to court to get supervised visits and he bailed\u201d You\u2019re not going to come out smelling like a rose.", "YTA I have a hard time believing that something you or her brother said hasn't led to a fit or fixation before, since you say it is common, and it would be just as cruel to deny you contact or custody based on that fact. He was expressing that he would accept her anyway, and I understand you don't like the fact that you're having to deal with a million questions and a \"fixation\", but it's going to happen over one thing or another, due to the nature of autism. It does seem petty and cruel to withdraw custody over such a comment, as I cannot see how he was trying to harm her with it.", "YTA\nFirst, I am autistic. So don't try and pull some Autism Mom bs about how nobody understands autistics. \nSecond, your daughter is autistic. Not \"has autism\". \n\nNow, your ex saw something that to his limited information, seemed like it's possible your child isn't cis/het... His response was to be OPEN AND SUPPORTIVE of your child instead of demanding they fit into a small box... and you now are calling him abusive", "While you shouldn\u2019t be going to court over it, he shouldn\u2019t have suggested to your 9 year old daughter that she was trans just because she didn\u2019t like heels or dresses.

It seems like you have been waiting for something to punish your ex with and this is it. \n\nIf you think of his intention, it doesn\u2019t sound like it was malicious. Perhaps this kind of issue would be best sorted out with a mediator, counsellor or family therapy. Taking him to court is just an overreaction.", "YTA this isn't something even remotely ok to go nuclear over calm tf down he didn't tell her she's trans or a boy or whatever he just said he'd accept her no matter what", "YTA, \n\nThis could have been dealt with outside of the court. And unless I am not understanding the laws and I don't have enough info on what state you live in, he did not break a single law to have the right to see his children taken away from him.

Please speak with your daughter, OP, and explain that her father did the same sort of thing to you and that was a part of why you left him.

They couched it in *so many* modifiers: limited information, seems, possible.

He totally understood that some people are trans and what trans is, but he did show some anxiety about him getting to \"stay a boy\" because he liked being a boy.\n\nIt took two seconds to assure him that was okay.

ANOTHER REASON FOR TRANS PANIC!\"\n\nWhere I do agree with you is that it's been apparent to me for a while (months) that there's attempted manipulation/exploitation of AITA, experimentation on it, etc. It's unclear for what, but you see posts about one situation, and then a week or two later, another extremely similar situation where one variable is altered. There are also posts with extremely similar verbiage. You read it and you're like \"I've read this author before.\"\n\nAnother thing I've seen recently is some attempted manipulation of the likes on a post. You'll see a large number of comments and then the likes on the post itself suppressed. Some kind of brigading being done.

I'm not not saying \"People are trans because more people are talking about it.\", I'm saying people have always been trans and they are starting to realize it because there is more conversation and they are realizing they relate strongly to people who have come out and talking about their experiences.  \n\n\nSort of like why more Gen X adults are realizing they have ADHD. They always had it. It just presented in ways, especially for women, that weren't recognized.   \n\n\nSo yes, this is going to be a going to be a conversation that happens more and more.
