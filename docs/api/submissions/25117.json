My Father is 54 for anyone wondering. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, my Mom got engaged to her Fianc\u00e9e( fake name) Joseph. Joseph is a fairly nice guy but we do have different takes on a lot of differing topics like politics(which I try not to judge someone on), behaviors and appropriate boundaries. By appropriate boundaries I mean calling before coming to see me and my family and not making controversial jokes. One joke he likes to make a lot is how I\u2019m a gold digger because my husband is the bread winner and makes over double of my income. At first I tried to brush it off and privately texted him and my mom about why I didn\u2019t appreciate these jokes especially in front of family. Now before anyone thinks I\u2019m actually a gold digger, my husband actually made less then me when we met. \n\nJoseph understood over text but continued to make some of the same jokes. I just tried to move on and continue to ignore them. Since they got engaged, my mom has been saving money for their wedding. Joseph also has but not as much as my mom since he says and I quote \u201cweddings are just something to make your wife happy and no husband actually likes them.\u201d Im not sure how my mom hasn\u2019t seen this as a red flag. Again I ignored it since its not my situation. 4 months into the engagement (now) my mom messaged me asking \u201c Hi Sweetie! You know the weddings coming up and I was wondering when you were gonna help pay for it?\u201d I was shocked because she didn\u2019t even help pay for me and husband\u2019s wedding, my dad paid for his part and her part. Also in my opinion I don\u2019t think your kid should help pay for your wedding even if they are grown. I responded to her text saying \u201c I wasn\u2019t informed I had to help pay. I can maybe buy your cake or something\u201d But she didn\u2019t take that very well and called me sobbing saying how she has done everything for me and how I wont even help her pay for the best day of her life. Sure if it was a smaller wedding I might have been able to pay for some of it. But this is a 50k+ wedding. She\u2019s expecting me to pay over 15k. I didn\u2019t want to hear anymore of her sobbing so I hung up. Im not sure how to feel, on one hand shes my mom, on the other she\u2019s expecting me to pay for a wedding for her and someone that doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries and didn\u2019t even help pay for mine.

The $15,000 she wants is lot of money. \n\nYour mom marrying a man who does not respect you and ignores your requests to stop is not someone you want around you & your family.

First and foremost, you're under no obligation to fund your mother's wedding, especially if there was no prior conversation about it. It's traditional in many cultures for parents to assist with their children's weddings, not the other way around. Even outside of tradition, a sudden expectation for you to chip in $15k+ without any prior discussion isn't appropriate. While Joseph's comments to you are disrespectful and concerning, they're somewhat separate from the main issue. However, they do give context to the dynamics at play. Your offer to contribute towards the cake was a reasonable compromise. Your mother's emotional reaction seems manipulative. Stand your ground and remember you're not in the wrong here.", "NTA. I find it kind of odd to be honest. Maybe offering to pay for something as you and your husbands gift such as the cake like you said would be a nice gesture but I don't see how you should even  be obligated to do that.
