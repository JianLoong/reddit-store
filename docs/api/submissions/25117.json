My Father is 54 for anyone wondering. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, my Mom got engaged to her Fianc\u00e9e( fake name) Joseph. Joseph is a fairly nice guy but we do have different takes on a lot of differing topics like politics(which I try not to judge someone on), behaviors and appropriate boundaries. By appropriate boundaries I mean calling before coming to see me and my family and not making controversial jokes. One joke he likes to make a lot is how I\u2019m a gold digger because my husband is the bread winner and makes over double of my income. At first I tried to brush it off and privately texted him and my mom about why I didn\u2019t appreciate these jokes especially in front of family. Now before anyone thinks I\u2019m actually a gold digger, my husband actually made less then me when we met. \n\nJoseph understood over text but continued to make some of the same jokes. I just tried to move on and continue to ignore them. Since they got engaged, my mom has been saving money for their wedding. Joseph also has but not as much as my mom since he says and I quote \u201cweddings are just something to make your wife happy and no husband actually likes them.\u201d Im not sure how my mom hasn\u2019t seen this as a red flag. Again I ignored it since its not my situation. 4 months into the engagement (now) my mom messaged me asking \u201c Hi Sweetie! You know the weddings coming up and I was wondering when you were gonna help pay for it?\u201d I was shocked because she didn\u2019t even help pay for me and husband\u2019s wedding, my dad paid for his part and her part. Also in my opinion I don\u2019t think your kid should help pay for your wedding even if they are grown. I responded to her text saying \u201c I wasn\u2019t informed I had to help pay. I can maybe buy your cake or something\u201d But she didn\u2019t take that very well and called me sobbing saying how she has done everything for me and how I wont even help her pay for the best day of her life. Sure if it was a smaller wedding I might have been able to pay for some of it. But this is a 50k+ wedding. She\u2019s expecting me to pay over 15k. I didn\u2019t want to hear anymore of her sobbing so I hung up. Im not sure how to feel, on one hand shes my mom, on the other she\u2019s expecting me to pay for a wedding for her and someone that doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries and didn\u2019t even help pay for mine.

According to your mum's partner you're a 'gold digger' who doesn't earn enough to pay your way in your own marriage, so that should be enough of a reason not to pay for theirs.", "Tell her you will generously contribute exactly the amount she contributed to your wedding.  NTA", "Nta - maybe her good digger fiance can pony up some money. Honestly, is your mom for real??? If she can't afford to pay for her wedding then she shouldn't have such an expensive wedding.", "NTA - Your mother dumping her expectation of you paying for her wedding on you is wrong a million times over. Plus she waited to the last minute to inform you, not ask. The $15,000 she wants is lot of money. \n\nYour mom marrying a man who does not respect you and ignores your requests to stop is not someone you want around you & your family. This is just another story of a weak woman putting a bad man above her family. Don\u2019t give mom a penny for her wedding. Stand your ground OP!", "No, don't pay. This is a ridiculous ask. NTA", "NTA. It's not a child's responsibility to pay for the parent's wedding. This day in age, it shouldn't be anyone's responsibility to pay for a wedding except the bride and groom. Their marriage, their party, their bill. If people are generous enough to help, that's great. Never expected or ask of someone though", "NTA I am mystified why your mother is planning a 50k wedding for her second marriage but whatever floats her boat. If she and Mr Wonderful want a lavish wedding, they can pay for it.", "NTA\n\nYou never offered, and it is not customary for a child to pay for a parent's SECOND wedding so there is NO reason she should have expected this.  This is all above and beyond the fact that her fiancee doesn't deserve the help and by his own words DOESN\"T THINK it's needed. \n\nIt really is a mystery where she got the impression that you'd chip in (over and beyond the usually dress/wedding gift.... obligations).", "NTA sounds like you need to go low contact with the both of them untill they learn boundaries and basic respect.", "NTA...if she wants it she can buy it.  You are not responsible for helping to pay for a wedding.  Out of curiosity is this her second one?", "NTA.\n\n>You know the weddings coming up and I was wondering when you were gonna help pay for it?\n\nI don't like this entitled approach from your mom. She could have worded it better and made it more of a request. At the end of the day, it's your money and you get to decide what you do with it. But if you're not helping her just to spite Joseph, then I'd reconsider your decision for the sake of your relationship with your mother. Either way NTA mate.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to pay for your mother's wedding, especially since it's so expensive and you weren't even informed of it beforehand. Besides, you offering to pay for a cake is already doing more than you needed to. It's not like you owe her or her fianc\u00e9. He's been rude to you and she didn't contribute any money to your wedding.", "Oh so NTA !\nIn no world that I know, does a child help pay for their Mothers second wedding.\n\nFurther to that, for your mother to ASSUME you would be helping is entitlement to the Nth degree!", "NTA. This is not a reasonable request and she seems quite entitled.", "NTA. Tell her you will pay as much as she paid for yours. This \u201cgold digger\u2019s\u201d purse is closed. \nYes she is your mom, yes you love her. It does not give her the right to use you. And she bloody well should have shut her fianc\u00e9 crap down a long time ago.", "NTA. It is up to your mom to plan the wedding they can afford.", "NTA. This a bonkers request.", "NTA. What 59 year old pays 50K for a second wedding? The normal answer would be: someone who could afford to, but this is obviously not the case here. \n\nYou don't owe your mother a wedding. Tell her she can have $100 as her gift. LOL", "NTA. What is even going on? Is she expecting you to pay because you and your husband are comfortable? This is absurd. I\u2019m so sorry she\u2019s putting you in this position.", "NTA did she really say that the best day of her life is her second wedding and not anything that has to do with her children? That\u2019s not how you butter the bread before asking for money", "NTA. 15K? She\u2019s out of her flipping mind! \nIf she keeps harping about it, tell her you will not be attending at all. No = No. She paid diddly squat for your wedding. You pay the same.", "Sounds like your mom is the gold digger and her fianc\u00e9 is projecting it onto you. NTA", "NTA. First and foremost, you're under no obligation to fund your mother's wedding, especially if there was no prior conversation about it. It's traditional in many cultures for parents to assist with their children's weddings, not the other way around. Even outside of tradition, a sudden expectation for you to chip in $15k+ without any prior discussion isn't appropriate. While Joseph's comments to you are disrespectful and concerning, they're somewhat separate from the main issue. However, they do give context to the dynamics at play. Your offer to contribute towards the cake was a reasonable compromise. Your mother's emotional reaction seems manipulative. Stand your ground and remember you're not in the wrong here.", "NTA. I find it kind of odd to be honest. Maybe offering to pay for something as you and your husbands gift such as the cake like you said would be a nice gesture but I don't see how you should even  be obligated to do that. And 50k plus for a 2nd wedding, actually any wedding, is a heck of alot of money.  If your mum has a sister or cousin or such she is close to Perhaps you could have a chat with about suggesting to your mother things should be smaller.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
