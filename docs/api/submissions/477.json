I use to be in AFROTC but I quit after 2 years because covid hit and my parents also weren't very supportive of the military. However, ever since (I quit 2020), I've always had second thoughts and even attempted rejoining but always backed out. fast forward to two years, I graduate college and I see one of my friends commission and I start getting frustrated cause all I could think of was that that was supposed to be me up there too. But I try my best to let it go, because I had convinced my self I quit for a reason and its time to move on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat same month I graduate, I meet my SO who before we started dating, made it very clear he was joining the marines. I vaguely told him about my interest in the Air Force but never expressed interest in re-joining or enlisting, and told him I actually wanted to work from home in the next 3 or so years. But the more I got to know him, the more jealous I got he was getting these experiences in the military that I wish I had gotten to experience too if I hadn't quit. He was very happy that I wanted to work from home and that I had no interest in joining because he was hoping we could move in together sometime in the future without having too many things tying us down, except for the marines of course. So I never told him about the possibility that I might want to get back into it. Also because the reason why he joined was because he had no direction in his life, and was also a college dropout, he just wants to be put to work. I on the other hand have some direction career wise, and did finish school. So I felt like I should just leave the military stuff to him and focus on my career. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did start the process of joining the AF reserves because that just felt right for me, it's part time and I can still focus on my career while also getting the experiences I so longed for before. However, I feel like by doing this I am afraid he'll feel like I am trying to one-up him and eventually feel like he has nothing to provide for me because I am already \"doing it all\" and maybe even earning triple what he does. As ridiculous of a comparison that this is, this situation is similar to that of where Charlie D'amelio started singing knowing it was her sister's (Dixie) department, and that ended up hurting dixie a little so I just want to know if I will be an asshole for even considering taking this decision to join.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the advice and guidance! I\u2019ve decided I will talk to him once he\u2019s back from Basic training. I was mostly afraid he\u2019ll think I\u2019m joining just because he is and that he wouldn\u2019t understand the background of my desire to join. Or that he would get upset at me for not disclosing my interest sooner which is valid. But I can\u2019t put my life on pause for someone (as you guys have stated) so I will do my best to communicate with him about it and making sure I\u2019m joining for the right reasons.", "created_utc": 1667180780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhxe6e/wibta_for_joining_the_military_right_after_my_so/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're afraid his ego is too fragile to be with a successful partner. If you're right, you need to be with a man who is proud of your drive & accomplishments. If you're wrong, you're being disrespectful.  Tell him.", "NTA. If he thinks that you are one-upping him and he has nothing to offer in a relationship because you earn more, it's time to seriously reexamine where those ideas of his are coming from, because a man's worth in a relationship is not how much money he can bring, but how good of a friend and lover he is. Join the reserves if that's what feels true. Explore the options, they have programs where two members of the military can be stationed together or at least nearby, and if you are in the reserves, you are just going for the drills several times a year anyway, so technically you are not tied to the location anyway. Invite him for an open discussion about why your successes feel invalidating to him.", "NTA. Stop it already!!!! You want to join the Air Force, join the freaking Air Force!!! You are a grown person just starting out\u2026don\u2019t make the mistake of stifling your dreams for some man who (you only imagine) wants you to. The best relationships are those in which one partner says \u201cI\u2019m going to do this with my life\u201d and the other partner says \u201cI\u2019m going to do that with my life\u201d and then they love each other enough to support and accommodate each other\u2019s dreams. The worst relationships are those that leave us guessing what we should do, how we should do it, tiptoeing around some person who might become enraged because we dare to want to fulfill our own dreams.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't put your life goals on hold for fear of bruising his ego.  Do you really want to be a tag along wife to an enlisted Marine, when you yourself would be a second lieutenant in the reserves?  *(If I understand correctly)*\n\nIf you really think he's the one, go to couples counseling and talk about career goals, money, how many kids you want, how he'll feel if you are the primary bread winner.  All that stuff is better to find out now.  Divorce is very, very hard.", "NTA...& if he loves you he will & SHOULD  support you. \nMy youngest son always talked about the military growing up...not really joining ~just was interested in it...in HS he then talked abt going to college then joining the USAF afterwards...I'll be honest~my husband and I weren't thrilled about him going into the military (any branch)...then he said he wanted to be a pilot...then senior year he applied to 2 of the only universities he wanted to apply to & thankfully was accepted to both. No more talk about the military~graduated from HS...started at university in 2021~last November (his 1st year) he announced he was going to join the Army reserves...he just couldn't get the feeling of the military out of his system (or the want of the challenge and service)..\nI was to say the least...a bit devastated \ud83d\ude22(just because I'm his mom & I knew how much I'd miss him)...but that was a me thing...he went to BCT/AIT training for 4 months this past may soon as classes ended for rhe summer...I  couldn't be more PROUD of my son! He excelled in basic training ~I think if he didn't go~he would never have been happy that he didn't follow his dream of serving somehow...this way he's getting his degree in mechanical engineering while also serving in the Army Corp of Engineers for 6 years...his gf understood...thankfully & was very supportive.  \nSo I guess what I'm saying is ~do you think you will be able to get past the feeling if you don't go? If you join the reserves...it should be a weekend a month...plus a longer time in the summer...I'm not sure what the AForce is like...but my son is in for 6 yrs....it is a bit of a commitment.", "NTA- I'm guessing a reason that he may feel like you would be one upping him is because with a college degree you would be able to join as an officer and not as enlisted in which you would out rank him and make more money. His happiness about you being able to work from home comes from being able to the job when you have to move for duty stations. But if this is something that you feel strongly about you need to talk to him about it. This may mean that the relationship won't survive if he isn't supportive of your choice to enlist or you becoming resentful because you didn't enlist to make him happy.  But from what I've read you really want to be in the military and want to experience it for yourself. Make the best decision for you not for someone else's.", "I will take your advice and talk to him once he has the time as it aligns with what everyone else has said. Thank you!", "You\u2019re right. Thank you for the advice !", "Thank you! Alright I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do then. I guess I can\u2019t scare the right person away anyways right. I just hope he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m joining just because he joined, although I take responsibility for not bringing up the conversation sooner out of fear", "I like how you phrased it. That helps a lot, thank you! I should not put my dreams on hold", "Wow I\u2019m so happy for your son and that was a very inspiring story. I know that if we break up I won\u2019t be happy with the fact that I decided not to join cause in the end my fear would have been useless. But thank you for your advice! I relate a lot to this story and it helps give me some guidance", "I hope you make the best choice for you and your life and future \ud83d\ude42 I wish well ."]}
