My dad however saw this and did everything he could to make sure I knew I was loved. So as you can see my sister became very entitled because of this.\n\nJust about a year later my parents are divorced and they split custody with us. My mom and I's relationship was getting better because she was finally getting the help she needed but unfortunately the damage was done. My sister was always yelling at my mother whenever she didn't want to do something or was constantly stealing or breaking both of our belongings. My mother didn't know how to handle this and always treated my sister like a friend instead of a parent. It got so bad to the point that every morning she would scream and slam her door because she didn't want to go to school or something, making all of us late. I almost got suspended for how many times she made me late! I don't know how it escalated from there but she somehow decided to take all of her issuses out on me. One day I was at my dad's and my best friend came over to hang out and we kept smelling this foul smell in my room, but had no idea what it was. Finally it got so bad to the point it would make you gag just stepping into the room. My best friend and I finally discovered that someone had peed into my little garbage can in my room, (it had a lid and was in the corner of my room). We were clearly disgusted and absolutely astonished at who could do something like this. I mean it's not like we didn't have a decent bathroom.\n\nThat was just the beginning though. I could stay here and write all the terrible things she has done but we would be here for a while. Just to give you an insight: she has pooped in my cat's litter box, ruined my belongings whether she peed on it or just destroyed it. Or one of my paintings she repainted and wrote \"I am watching you\". The list goes on...\n\nTo present day I have moved out of state to live with my fiance and I am scared to tell my family that she isn't invited to our wedding. My sister has tormented me for years and yet my family tell me that I have to suck it up and say that, \"she's your sister\" or \"you'll only have each other after we're gone\". \n\nI just cannot begin to tell you how much I resent her, after all the family takes her side to this day.

You went through torture, and your fear of losing your parents is overshadowing common sense - common sense is to cut this person entirely out of your life.  \n\nYour parents are acting irrationally, probably because to fully admit their daughter has a major problem would break them, and so you are asked to do the impossible and live in the shadow of fear all your life. \n\nTherapy is indeed the only way to handle this.

You are probably feeling very neglected considering your parents have been basically submitting you to abuse from your sister for years. You are young and reasonably want support for your wedding, but think of it this way. If they decide not to show up or support your wedding, that is their loss, and the last chance they'll have to see their oldest daughter get married. They will never get to experience that ever again, and considering how psycho your little sister sounds? Even if she does eventually get married, it'll probably be very stressful and drama filled. This may be very hard since it's apparent you love your parents in spite of the abuse, but I would have this be the ultimatum for low to no contact. Do you really need unsupportive people in your life? Family who won't put you first, ever? Weddings should be about love and happiness, and having this stress weigh down on your every decision of whether or not your sister will do something inappropriate is not it. Let your family know your decision, and understand that none of this is your fault. I hope you have a beautiful and drama-free wedding!", "It gives OP the excuse that she doesn't want her sister marking the venue, at least.\n\nImagine if the sister peed on a place of worship!", "NTA - sit down with your parents if you have to and tell them why. If they can't understand and don't come to your wedding that's on them. I've been through something similar with an older sibling. They were always \"the golden child\" no matter how much crap they pulled or trouble they got into, parents would bail them out. It's been almost a decade now, but parents finally realize I don't want to hear or know anything about sibling, have LC themselves because sibling only ever calls for $$ and doesn't include them in their life in any other way.", "NTA.  Even though she isn't invited to the wedding, there is a great possiblity that someone (like your mom) will tell her about the wedding.  Either she'll just show up on her own, or she'll come with your mom or another family member.  If she's the psycho like you say she is, she'll want to come to just make a scene.\n\nYou are going to need to get infront of this.  You need to speak with your mom and get her to agree to not telling her and not bringing her.  \n\nIf you still don't feel comfortable and are concerned about your sister showing up and making a scene - I'd do one of the following - have a destination wedding or elope - or get good security for your wedding.  I like the destination option myself as it's not fair to you to not have a nice wedding and it's pretty hard for someone to just crash a destination wedding.\n\nSorry you have to deal with such toxicity in your life.", "NTA at all. But your sister is seriously disturbed- people don\u2019t do that!", "I am sad to say OP but if your parents say no to attending your wedding then you need to reestablish what family is.

Sometimes having none of them there is better than the harm of having them all.", "Has your sister ever received therapy for these issues? They are not normal, in any way. Urinating/defecating in a home and on peoples belongings indicates a mental imbalance. People who go out of their way to purposely antagonize those around them, tend to draw the line at relieving themselves on others property.", "If your family doesn't come, it's their loss. You should always enjoy the people you're with. Dress shopping should be a fun time for the bride and the walk down the isle is very symbolic. Do you want to go dress shopping and find out your sister peed or pooped in the shop? What else will she do during your wedding? Imagine what you'll have to deal with with your friends and in-laws if she does do something! You don't want your wedding to be memorable for the wrong reasons. It might even be posted on r/weddingshaming.", "Why would you want people who enable your sister in your life. Your sister will ruin your wedding if she comes. You need to start putting yourself first.", "If they don't come it's  on them  and honestly  enabling  her makes then toxic for you.  You may not see it ,I know it's  hard  to cut them off but it might be the best for your mental  health.  Get a therapist  to try diminish  the trauma your sister  caused you and keep her as far away from you as posible  despite 'she's family ' opinions. \n\nYou are an adult ,go alone  or with your fiance  down  the aisle  if necessary  and  your father refuses to come.  You are starting a new life with him .", "I'm surprised more people aren't pointing this out. This isn't normal behaviour.", "i\u2019m trying to be as gentle as possible here because i understand most people don\u2019t just want to not be around and get along with family. but i think you need to be real and honest with yourself and ask: why am i allowing people to make excuses for a grown woman that does these horrific things to me and only me? \n\nyour family is not dumb, they know that anyone over the age of 3/4 using their urine as a weapon is not all there mentally. why do you think you\u2019re deserving of this treatment? i hate to say it but i think you need to reframe just how much you believe your family actually loves and respects you. they clearly don\u2019t love you (or your sister for that matter) because you\u2019re YOU, they put up with you and her because they have a genetic connection to you and think that that supersedes anything else. they are wrong. \n\nanyone who would choose the person being abusive over the person being abused is complicit in abuse themselves. please read and reread that again.", ">I'm just scared my family won't come if I don't invite her. Who will walk me down the isle and go dress shopping with me?\n\nThis proves you are NTA. Your family might try to bully you into inviting her. Don't give in. Who will be there for you if your family refuses? People who love you.\n\nIf your family insists that you allow yourself to be bullied by your sister or they will not attend, have your wedding without them.\n\n>My dad said she's coming around but he's been saying that for years. \n\nIf she's actually coming around, it's too little, too late. Letting her attend your wedding would be taking a huge risk that she will sabotage it. Do not take that risk.\n\nYour sister needs therapy. You need to be safe and happy at your own wedding. Do not invite her. If mom feels the need to stay home with her, so be it.", "The pee and poop sounds like there is pathology behind it. Our 6 yo chihuahua has been doing the same with puppies added to the family.", "NTA\n\nShe's proven that she cannot be trusted to behave acceptably.\n\nThere is no reason at all to believe she will be ok that day.... \n\nAnd there's no need to have it cloud over a day so important to you.\n\nIt's sad that your family can't acknowledge their failure with her, but it's certainly not your problem.", "NTA- you can't control how your parents will react, but quite frankly they did nothing to stop the behavior so they can't have any kind of expectations on you.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t let her in!", "Your sister needs a me take health evaluation and a lot of intense therapy. You would not be the AH for inviting her, your wedding, your day and  going by her history she will do something to ruin it andYour parents need to accept that and accept there is something not right with your sister and get her the help she needs asap.", "NTA - My mom used to feed me the same line to justify not disciplining my older brother when he abused me as a kid. If you really want a peaceful and happy wedding, I wouldn\u2019t invite anyone who thinks you should invite her.", "Invite her to the wedding no plus 1, then have security there and not allow her to enter.\n\nNta", "Put it on her. Tell your parents you won\u2019t have wild children at the wedding. After they agree that that is a good idea, tell them it includes sister.", "NTA. I didn't invite my father to my wedding because he was a alcoholic who probably would have  ruined it one way or another.  Lots of people said it was harsh but I wasn't taking the risk.  Tbh your sister sounds way more unhinged.  It's just not normal to pee on everything.i would have the conversation with your family about why you don't want her there and beg them to keep it from her so they don't even tell her when or where it will be.", "NTA but you will have to go NC with some members of your family if they can't respect your boundaries. A lot of people who pressure reconciliation, it's because they haven't experienced familial abuse and really just don't believe it. I had a ton of people say \"But he's your father to me.\"\n\n If they want to keep abusers in their lives because FaMIlY that's on them. You get decide who is in your life. You get decide who comes to your wedding (with your fiance). You do not owe anyone forgiveness. I'd consider sending an email that won't be inviting your sister and if this is a problem for them, they should also not attend the wedding and just leave it at that. Anyone who wants to argue etc, block them. Just that simple.  I know it sounds easy, but I know it's difficult short term. Long term, however, it's the best way to go. It's the anticipation that's the worst part. Tell them and let them deal with their feelings.", "Right? I was like oh she is gonna drink a vat of tea and pee like a firehose all over the place.", "You're NTA but I feel I should say the following:\n\n1.  I fully believe your parents are using YOU as a meat shield as in as long as your sister directs her ire towards YOU, she doesn't pee on THEIR stuff or focus as much of her anger/hatred on them.\n2. Please get security for your wedding and lock things down with passwords.  Your parents sound like the type to try to sneak her in or show up and demand she come in.  Stay out of her throwing range.  \n3. Ok, lets pretend you DO invite her and she inevitably (and I mean INEVITABLY) does something along the lines of throwing poo/piss at you or your guests.  How can your parents possibly apologize/make up for something like that?  They can't.  In worst case, your parents won't EVEN APOLOGIZE but instead demand you forgive your sister and \"get over it.\"  \n4. never invite anybody who is not happy to see YOU happy to your wedding.  If your parents/relatives are willing for you to have a breakdown at your wedding because your sister demands to \"show her dominance,\" they do not care about your happiness.  \n5. I hope that you have a happy wedding.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
