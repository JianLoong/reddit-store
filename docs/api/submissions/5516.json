My parents were unfortunately going through a divorce and my mother had some mental problems that took a toll on all of us. She unfortunately decided to shut me out but gave my sister all of the attention she wanted because she is 'her baby'. My dad however saw this and did everything he could to make sure I knew I was loved. So as you can see my sister became very entitled because of this.\n\nJust about a year later my parents are divorced and they split custody with us. My mom and I's relationship was getting better because she was finally getting the help she needed but unfortunately the damage was done. My sister was always yelling at my mother whenever she didn't want to do something or was constantly stealing or breaking both of our belongings. My mother didn't know how to handle this and always treated my sister like a friend instead of a parent. It got so bad to the point that every morning she would scream and slam her door because she didn't want to go to school or something, making all of us late. I almost got suspended for how many times she made me late! I don't know how it escalated from there but she somehow decided to take all of her issuses out on me. One day I was at my dad's and my best friend came over to hang out and we kept smelling this foul smell in my room, but had no idea what it was. Finally it got so bad to the point it would make you gag just stepping into the room. My best friend and I finally discovered that someone had peed into my little garbage can in my room, (it had a lid and was in the corner of my room). We were clearly disgusted and absolutely astonished at who could do something like this. I mean it's not like we didn't have a decent bathroom.\n\nThat was just the beginning though. I could stay here and write all the terrible things she has done but we would be here for a while. Just to give you an insight: she has pooped in my cat's litter box, ruined my belongings whether she peed on it or just destroyed it. Or one of my paintings she repainted and wrote \"I am watching you\". The list goes on...\n\nTo present day I have moved out of state to live with my fiance and I am scared to tell my family that she isn't invited to our wedding. My sister has tormented me for years and yet my family tell me that I have to suck it up and say that, \"she's your sister\" or \"you'll only have each other after we're gone\". \n\nI just cannot begin to tell you how much I resent her, after all the family takes her side to this day. I don't know I'm just scared to tell my family and them not wanting to come to my wedding. What should I do?

I try to be civil for my other sister to see but sometimes her lies piss me off and I sometimes call her out. Like one time she was telling a story and making everything about her and I just confronted her and told her to stop lying. My dad just told me to back down and made me cry infront of everyone.

I mean has she changed or is she still like that?  \n\nFor now I go with NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone gives you grief over your decision, remind them that weddings are for you and the people who make you happy. Your sister has never been one of those people.", "NTA, OP. Yes, she's your sister, but 'family' is what YOU make it. She sounds like she has serious issues, which aren't your problem. If you fold & invite her? I do believe you will deeply regret it. Good luck out there.", "NTA. Get security for your wedding so she doesn\u2019t get to go into the venue.", "NTA. Even if she behaves you'll be on edge and you don't want that on your wedding day. Make sure everyone know she is not welcome. If they give you a hard time, tell them they don't have to attend either.", "She's your sister. Not your family.\nNTA, and get security to kick her out of your wedding should she decide to go anyway", "NTA - Being \u201cfamily\u201d isn\u2019t defined only by last name or by blood. It\u2019s defined by commitment, love, and behavior. Three things that your sister has not shown over the years. Your wedding day should be all about you and your husband\u2019s happiness and if having her attend will in any way negatively affect your happiness on that special day then do not invite her.", "There are a lot of people that think family comes first, and to some extent they do. However, when it becomes abusive or toxic, you have to protect your sanity. You have to think how you will feel years from now - will your regret not including her?  If not, then you are making the right decision. I\u2019d rip that bad aid off soon and tell your parents, but when you do, go in armed with a list of reasons and things she has done. It should be a happy time in your life.", "NTA. If she causes destruction when she doesnt get her way at home, I imagine she would do the same at a wedding venue.

If they decide to come, remember it\u2019s not about you.

Because frankly there\u2019s no reason to think they will.\n\nFirst, are you in therapy? Because this is tough stuff.\n\nSecond, is this the hill to die on? I think it is. But if you had to choose between a wedding with your sister and a wedding without your family, which would you choose? I think you have to exclude her, but accept that your family may continue to let you down.\n\nFinally\u2014is there *anyone * in your family you can count on to have your back? Like, would your dad show up to walk you down the aisle, even if your mom will probably choose her golden child?\n\nI am sorry, OP.

Your family are enabling her behaviour and allowing her to victimise you. You might well have to cut them out too if they try bullying you into having contact with her.", "NTA. Just be clear with your family that she is not invited because of what she has done, even better in front of her and the all family. Her behaviour is feral and unpredictable, and you don't deserve to have your wedding ruined. Let them know that you are related by blood but that doesn't make her family, and she never will. Be prepared that your parents (or at least your mother) may not come to the wedding. But that is OK, your life not theirs.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding you get to decide who is invited.

Unfortunately they will probably decide not to come to the wedding as they\u2019ve been enabling this behavior for years.

Has she been diagnosed or treated? \n\nEven if you don't want a relationship with her, your sister needs treatment. If your parents still don't recognize her monstrous behavior, you should list it out for them. It sounds like they are sweeping it under a rug. Imagine she doesn't learn to regulate her behavior: what kind of coworker, friend, or romantic partner would put up with that? Or, God forbid, child?\n\nShe's still young, so maybe she will moderate her behavior, but that's still 10 years from now.\n\nYou're pretty young for marriage, too. Have you talked to a counselor about the dysfunction you grew up with? Sometimes people rush into building a new family to escape the dynamics of their family of origin. \n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nAlso if your parents aren\u2019t getting your sister professional help, then they are failing as parents.\n\nI used to work with children like this. Without the parent(s) getting their child the help they need, they child is screwed. The consequences to such behaviors as she goes into adulthood will be severe. Letting her go on like this is doing her a disservice and you\u2019ve been collateral damage.", "NTA\n\n\nHer last stunt was to pee in front of your door a few months ago?!! WTF\n\n\nNo. She isn't allowed at your wedding. Be prepared for your parents to not come. She will absolutely act out and create chaos as a way to further punish you. Your parents are going to be held hostage by her. She's legally still under their care and they probably can't leave her alone.\n\nIt's your wedding...you're marrying your partner.

As someone that comes from a shitty family, I'll say this: my best guy friend walked me down the aisle and I went dress shopping with a friend AND my fiance and I have ZERO regrets about it. Make your own family if your real family sucks and know that \"traditions\" are dumb.", "Wow she seems to have some real mental issues, she needs therapy. It's s tough choice, risk having her ruining the wedding or risk not having her which also could ruin your wedding by not having your family. I think i I would take option 2 and speak to them.", "She's what, 15 or 16 and expressing her emotions by peeing in things? Has she ever gone through therapy or been diagnosed with anything? That is very much not normal or okay, and not the sort of thing you want anywhere near what should be a nice day for you. And of they won't come without her, you're probably better off without them they're too.", "NTA. It\u2019s your party.. invite it restrict who you want.", "NTA, but you need to get in to see a therapist about this if you aren't already. I'm sorry, but the harsh reality is that your sister should not be allowed at your wedding, period. And if your family can't support you in that, then they shouldn't be there either. I know that will hurt for you, hence the therapy. But better to establish boundaries now than let this go one for miserable decades until it explodes.", "Harsh? You don't sound harsh. You went through torture, and your fear of losing your parents is overshadowing common sense - common sense is to cut this person entirely out of your life.  \n\nYour parents are acting irrationally, probably because to fully admit their daughter has a major problem would break them, and so you are asked to do the impossible and live in the shadow of fear all your life. \n\nTherapy is indeed the only way to handle this. Your parents might be good people who did the best they could, but in this case you are asked to ruin your life because they cannot take the stand they need to take. I am sorry this happened, but only a therapist can help you see the situation clearly and take the right steps. Discuss your fear they will leave you alone. It's crippling you at the moment, honey."]}
