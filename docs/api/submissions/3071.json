I inherited it 3 years ago and have been living in it since. I have 2 acres while my surrounding neighbors have maybe 1/2 an acre if they\u2019re lucky. The house is fairly small (2 bed 2 bath) so I have a very large front and back yard. I use maybe 1/5th of the backyard as a garden and the rest is basically an empty field. I\u2019ve always loved kids so I was happy to let my neighbors kids play in the field with the understanding that they would respect the property. Most of the kids are great, very respectful and understand that this is not their backyard. The problem is with my neighbors to the right.\n\nThey have 5 kids (f1, m3, m5, f5 and m7) who generally run around unsupervised. They don\u2019t come to my yard to play very often unless the other kids are playing soccer or baseball. The 7 year old is \u201cin charge\u201d as much as a 7 year old can be but obviously he can\u2019t replace parental supervision. 5 days ago the kids were playing baseball and he must have lost track of the 5 year olds at some point because when I came home from work I found their names sharpied onto my wall (name and name were here) along with some rude drawings (a man pooping, several piles of poop, that sort of thing) all along the right side of the house.\n\nI found their parents the next day and asked them to pay for the paint I\u2019ll need to cover it up, they were very offended, accused me of lying and said they weren\u2019t going to pay. If this had been all I probably would\u2019ve let it slide and covered the paint since it would only be like 20 dollars but later that day m5 decided it would be funny to throw rocks at my house. There are several dents in the siding where the rocks hit and two of my windows are broken. From what I\u2019ve been quoted to fix it it\u2019s about $800-$900 worth of damage. I talked to the parents who accused me of doing it myself to make their kids look bad. \n\nI\u2019ve decided those 5 are not allowed to use my yard until the damage is paid for, which I think is more than fair. When they came by this morning to play soccer with the other kids I politely explained the situation and said they would have to leave as they aren\u2019t allowed to play here anymore. The 7 year old was very upset (more sad than a temper tantrum which is understandable) but the 5 year olds were very angry. About an hour later their mom came by and cussed me out, yelling at my doorstep about how I\u2019m a horrible person who hates children because I\u2019m \u201cbitter and can\u2019t find a husband\u201d. I\u2019m standing my ground either way but a few other parents came by and seemed a little frustrated by my explanation as to why that family is no longer welcome which is making me question things.

I had to use this myself when my nephew drew on every surface in our house he could reach with a sharpie.", "NTA.  But you must stop.  No more kids, at all, ever.  You are liable for each, every, and all injuries and assaults on your property.  These are not trespassers, they are your invitees, to whom you owe legal duties.  Stop now, your homeowners\u2019s insurance will be less likely to deny the claims.", "NTA but a few things. \n\n1.) get cameras \n2.) report the damage to the police and get your solicitor to draft a letter \n3.) sorry but stop anyone using your property as you are opening up a whole legal can of worms and if people complain tell them who exactly ruined it for everyone and why you\u2019ve taken legal advice.", "NTA it's your property and your are doing these parents a favor by letting their kids play on your property. If other parents have an issue with your decision then their kids don't need to play on your property either \n\nOu should consider contacting the police about the writing, since they were dumb enough to write their names. Also get some cameras to protect yourself in the future", "NTA. Entitled parents, raise entitled children into entitled adults. Stand your ground. They can die on this hill if they want to, the only one's who suffer are their kids, and it's still the kids and parents fault.", "NTA call the police and sue them. Wtf is going on. And the other neighbours can shut the f**k up. It's not their property which has been destroyed", "Nta", "Get cameras immediately. This could easily escalate and you will need proof. Also, talk to a lawyer about your liability. If a kid gets hurt in your yard their parent is going to claim you were supposed to be supervising them.", "NTA. Call the cops. Full stop. Those kids will not improve their behavior. I say that as someone with previous neighbors having shitty children.", "NTA. Install some cameras. Record any further incidents, because it will escalate.", "NTA. Buy cameras.", "NTA When someone comes at you like that just agree. What are they going to do if you agree? There's no continuation\n\n>You are bitter you can't find a husband!\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\n>well.... FUCK YOU\n\nthere's no where for them to go after you just agree.", "NTA.

The kids and parents need to learn a lesson.", "Get cameras all around the house and NTA they lucky you let them in your backyard", "NTA. Put up cameras. There will be more property damage and you need documentation.", "A seven year old watching kids that young is unsafe. That\u2019s neglect. If you don\u2019t call CPS and anything happens you could also be liable. Report it before one of those kids gets hurt or killed due to their parents neglecting them.", "NTA. Time to put up security cameras. Then they can't claim my child didn't do it because I didn't see them do it. After that I'd call police with proof.", "NTA, but you need to see that these parents are telling their children that they don't have to respect you, and the 5-year-old has picked up on that message. The fact that there's already been an escalation with the 5-year-old vandalizing your house as well is something you should be concerned about.

Get cameras and no trespassing signs.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. Simply because it\u2019s your property. Also as others have said, get some cameras set up just in case.", "NTA but you might want to ban all the kids from your property. If one of the kids get hurt while playing on your property you could be liable.", "NTA You should get cameras so that you can prove that their little angels are responsible. It would also help if you wanted to pursue them for damages.", "NTA if the other parents keep bothering you tell them you're looking into a fence", "OP, you NEED cameras. You can't prove any of this was these kids. They could have been any kids. And these kids sound like they're just going to keep damaging your house. Get proof.", "It might also be worth it to tell the other neighbors that if the children continue to be destructive ALL the children will be banned from property & you will be putting up a fence.", "And I am planning to install cameras.", "If it comes to that it comes to that but right now I\u2019m just going to hope their sanity kicks in.", "Honestly I was so shocked by the whole thing I just stood there while she yelled like a banshee.", "Ha! That\u2019s why I\u2019m saving money.

Id add cameras everywhere to cover everything. I wouldn\u2019t put it past then to escalate things. Or even try and say their kids were injured on your property because of your negligence. CYA. COVER YOUR ASS", "These parents sound entitled. Kid might break his arm falling down the stairs and they will send him to your yard to claim it\u2019s your fault and sue. You said in another comment that you are well off, you have assets. \n\nCameras. Everywhere. Also, do the other parents know the story? That these kids broke your windows? Or did the entitled neighbors talk to them first?", "Grow Holly bushes if your climate allows or train roses with sharp thorns.", "Umbrella policy for your house and property.", "Great, even more assets to seize to satisfy the judgment against you.  Lawyers will love that insurance is not the end of the collection route.\nSorry, but you need to exclude all.  Period.", "Come on now. With all due respect they are gonna keep doubling down. He'll they might turn neighbors against you. I'd install cameras if you have the money.", "So what happens when she claims one of her kids was injured on your property and it\u2019s your fault?", "Then they will think they can do what they want if they don\u2019t ever suffer the consequences for their actions. You are just enabling them. Do you know the second one of them gets hurt on your property they are going to sue you right?", "Then this is your fault and not the kids/parents.  You're letting them do this and not following through on consequences.  You're a pushover and all of them know it.", "They have decided that they are entitled to your property because you \"can\u2019t find a husband\" and don't deserve your yard.\n\nThey are not going to reconsider anything.  It will just make them angry at you.", "Then you're fucked. Stop being a doormat, these brats will target your car or something worse next.", "Then you should stop bitching about the costs and just pay them. If you're not actually going to do anything to defend yourself, then get used to getting screwed over", "If you aren\u2019t worried about the money why don\u2019t you come to an agreement.  Let the kids work off the debt by helping weed the garden and other small tasks that are child appropriate.  It sounds like they need some discipline in their lives.  Also ask have a sincere apology.  You should still get cameras just to be safe.  It sounds like the parents are raising entitled brats.", "Good for you. \\[insert \"a common four letter acronym for cops that the mods will get upset with me if I post\" here\\], and calling cops on kids, literal kids, barely out of toddler-hood is obscene.\r  \n\r  \nNTA for not letting them in the yard, they should face consequences for what they did. I do think the parents should pay for the damages, but I understand if that's not a hill you want to die on.", "I'm pretty sure sanity doesn't work like that.\n\nUmbrella policy and cameras... not the answer, but a good start.", "The parents seem angry that a single woman owns property that their children 'deserve', and are going to continue to act entitled to it.", "I lucked out and all my neighbors had put up fences, effectively fencing in 3/4 of my back yard so it wasn't horribly expensive for us.", "I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t think of that, my dads trail cams are literally sitting in my garage right now. I\u2019ll put them up later tonight.", "I am planning to.", "In other words she\u2019s doing better financially than the family with five kids.", "fence fence fence fence", "Be very, very careful.  Your lawyer is absolutely a good idea.\n\nIt could go wrong so easily.  Consider what happens if the kids bring friends whose parents didn't sign.  Or kids just sneak in.  Or if *other* accusations are hurled?\n\nThe legal fees are the least of your concern.  Bad publicity or rumors could toast your reputation, long before the judge's hammer hits the gavel to absolve you.  That may well have severe business consequences.", "I would get the parents to sign a waiver saying that you aren't responsible for injuries and they are financially responsible for any damages done to your property by their family.

This is the parents fault. They should do your yard work not their tiny children!!  You are too kind and it will bite you. I\u2019d stop all the kids playing for three months and tell everyone why. Classic school teacher move! Then waivers for all to sign.", "If any of the kids are injured while they're playing on your property, you will be liable.  If you're well off, you would do yourself a favor to get a fence in addition to security cameras.  It sucks, but people suck and you know those neighbors would be the first to sue you if one of their little darlings fell and broke their arm while playing on your property.", "Ah I think I get it \nShe\u2019s reluctant to impose greater expenses on a family during tough times, that makes a lot more sense", "I\u2019ve scheduled a time with my lawyer next week to discuss it.", "If you tell everyone kids aren\u2019t allowed anymore then you\u2019re a little more protected if someone is injured. If you allow or encourage them on your property then definitely liable.

More? Would you be ok with being almost completely financially wiped out?

My husband's small company was sued by a much larger company.  It was clear that there was no basis for the suit but my husband's company still spent a lot of time and money defending itself.

This is not legal advice.  However. My mom workers in insurance.  OP,  if you have that much money, you NEED an umbrella policy to cya.  Otherwise, if/when a kid gets hurt and the parents come after you, their lawyer will see how much money you have and see a jackpot and try to take advantage.
