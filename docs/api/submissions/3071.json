{"id": 3071, "submission_id": "z30a4k", "title": "AITA for not letting my neighbors kids play in my yard until they pay to fix damage to my house?", "selftext": "My father bought the house in the 80s and held onto it as different developments sprung up around it. I inherited it 3 years ago and have been living in it since. I have 2 acres while my surrounding neighbors have maybe 1/2 an acre if they\u2019re lucky. The house is fairly small (2 bed 2 bath) so I have a very large front and back yard. I use maybe 1/5th of the backyard as a garden and the rest is basically an empty field. I\u2019ve always loved kids so I was happy to let my neighbors kids play in the field with the understanding that they would respect the property. Most of the kids are great, very respectful and understand that this is not their backyard. The problem is with my neighbors to the right.\n\nThey have 5 kids (f1, m3, m5, f5 and m7) who generally run around unsupervised. They don\u2019t come to my yard to play very often unless the other kids are playing soccer or baseball. The 7 year old is \u201cin charge\u201d as much as a 7 year old can be but obviously he can\u2019t replace parental supervision. 5 days ago the kids were playing baseball and he must have lost track of the 5 year olds at some point because when I came home from work I found their names sharpied onto my wall (name and name were here) along with some rude drawings (a man pooping, several piles of poop, that sort of thing) all along the right side of the house.\n\nI found their parents the next day and asked them to pay for the paint I\u2019ll need to cover it up, they were very offended, accused me of lying and said they weren\u2019t going to pay. If this had been all I probably would\u2019ve let it slide and covered the paint since it would only be like 20 dollars but later that day m5 decided it would be funny to throw rocks at my house. There are several dents in the siding where the rocks hit and two of my windows are broken. From what I\u2019ve been quoted to fix it it\u2019s about $800-$900 worth of damage. I talked to the parents who accused me of doing it myself to make their kids look bad. \n\nI\u2019ve decided those 5 are not allowed to use my yard until the damage is paid for, which I think is more than fair. When they came by this morning to play soccer with the other kids I politely explained the situation and said they would have to leave as they aren\u2019t allowed to play here anymore. The 7 year old was very upset (more sad than a temper tantrum which is understandable) but the 5 year olds were very angry. About an hour later their mom came by and cussed me out, yelling at my doorstep about how I\u2019m a horrible person who hates children because I\u2019m \u201cbitter and can\u2019t find a husband\u201d. I\u2019m standing my ground either way but a few other parents came by and seemed a little frustrated by my explanation as to why that family is no longer welcome which is making me question things. AITA for banning them from playing here?\n\nEdit: to answer some common concerns\n\nI will be installing cameras, I dug my dads old trail cams out of the garage so I\u2019ll put those up either tonight or tomorrow.\n\nI am aware of the liability issues with kids playing in my yard, I\u2019m willing to risk it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to put up a fence, I think they\u2019re ugly. The property line is clearly marked.\n\nI will not be banning the entire neighborhood unless I absolutely have to.\n\nEdit 2: I also have a meeting scheduled with my attorney to discuss the possibility of drawing up a liability waiver for the parents to sign, forgot to put that in the last edit lol.\n\nEdit 3: I\u2019ve been temp banned but if you have a questions I likely answered it somewhere else in the comments so look at my comment history.\n\nI\u2019ve called cps, they think everything is fine\n\n5m was still throwing the rocks when I got home, several other kids in the neighborhood also let me know what happened. That\u2019s how I know it was him.\n\nEdit 4: they\u2019re also usually supervised. Typically there\u2019s a parent or two hanging around anyway and I work from home so the kids know to knock on my door and ask me to watch them if their parents are busy. \n\nI am also looking into an umbrella policy that would be more likely to cover any injuries that occur.", "created_utc": 1669236920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z30a4k/aita_for_not_letting_my_neighbors_kids_play_in_my/", "score": 3439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get those cameras up!", "Yeah that\u2019s kinda the point", "Get one done for ALL the neighbors who have kids playing over in your yard, drop it at the door or the mailbox and let them know if you don\u2019t receive a signed waiver back by a \nspecific date, that they will have to prevent their children from trespassing on any part of your property for any reason. Make them the bad guys to their kids, not you. \u201cSorry, your mom and dad said you can\u2019t play in my yard anymore\u201d will work just fine if asked lol", "I would point out, are you absolutely sure you want to be the person inviting children to play in their yard then... Filming them?\n\nI'd do one or the other, not both. I know I know \"imagining the worst\" blah blah blah but it does sound quite dodgy on paper.\n\nAt the very least you need some CCTV signs and to tell the parents of all the children you know play in the yard.", "Nta but your views on risking liability and fencing are foolish", "NTA. Unfortunately this isn't going to end well. I can respect your kind heart and idealism, but you will regret it later. \nYou're either gonna be viewed as the meanie now by putting your foot down and not letting kids play on your property and protecting yourself from liability. Or you can be the meanie later after more damage to your home and property and possible lawsuits from unsupervised kids getting hurt or hurting others on your property. No matter what you're gonna be a meanie. Save yourself some time, money and frustration, ban the kids now.", "NTA\n\nThey broke they should fix it.", "Get the police involved. \n\nDon't let any children play in your yard, and let the parents of the good kids know why.", "NTA, no good has come from those particular kids being on your property, it sounds like.  This story makes me so glad for my neighbor.  Our driveway runs right up against his front yard, and it's a very skinny driveway.  I've got my Mustang, which I am overly fond and protective of.  His kids will be playing outside and if they end up getting too close to my car I'll hear either my neighbor or the grandpa yelling at them.  \"You know better than to be near that damn car!\"  I don't even get nervous anymore when he's mowing the lawn lol.  I just get the passenger side as close to our wall as I dare and give the most space I can between his grass and my car, and I know he'll be careful when he mows right there.  If his kids ended up doing anything to my car or our house, he'd probably be the one informing me it even happened at all before I even went outside to notice for myself.  I wouldn't even have to ask him to pay to fix it, he'd be offering to fix it himself.  They're good people.  Just sucks because you don't always get neighbors like that.  Not everyone is going to do the right thing.  And if they are going to be like that, and I were in your shoes?  I'd be wanting them to piss off and go be destructive and disrespectful somewhere else.", "Those are entitled parents", "After you explained missing your childhood experience with neighbors and not liking fences, I understand better. You sound like a great neighbor in an ideal world, but this could get you bankrupted by a terrible accident combined with a greedy insurance company and greedy attorneys, even if the family of an injured child would not want to see you lose everything. A child who needs lifelong care for a devastating injury can be mind-blowingly expensive. I worked for a few years with an insurance company attorney, super nice woman, but an absolute shark when defending the assets of the company, even against legitimate claims. They would exploit every loophole because their job was to make money for the company, not do the right thing for people. I left because I couldn\u2019t stomach being part of that, even in the most indirect way. If you knew what is said behind closed doors about how expensive care for disabled children is, how to avoid paying legitimate claims, withholding information from families so the company doesn\u2019t lose money, etc., you would not be so sure you could cover expenses. Aside from criminal liability, injured parties could sue you in civil court as well and just from what you\u2019ve said here, you can be held liable with or without a waiver, if a jury in civil court finds against you.\nI get that you loved the environment you grew up in, but we don\u2019t live in the same world and that\u2019s a good thing. If you want to do something great for kids, there are so many ways to be involved or give financial support. Providing access and trusting other people to ensure children\u2019s safety on your property is not wise. Make sure you use the right kind of attorney to draw up the waivers if you go that route - the one I worked for would actually laugh when she read the waivers people thought should have protected them because an attorney drew it up for them. I had to leave the job though she was a very pleasant boss because I couldn\u2019t handle my own emotions just knowing how injuries devastated families and how there\u2019s a whole financial sector making money off of that. \nAs for a view of the mountains, maybe you could add a story so you have an unimpeded view over your new fence. \nGood luck, good neighbor.", "They've caused $800 in damage and all you've done is *talk* to them? And they didn't ever listen?\n\nNo police report, no 'no-trespassing' signs, not a single shred of evidence that you told them to stop trespassing.\n\nYou realize that the next time they come over, the police can't even trespass them yet?\n\nCall the police, convey your concerns that the family appeared unwilling to stop trespassing when you talked to them, and ask the police to give the family a warning and put a note in their file that they *have* been told to stop trespassing. Only then can the police do something next time they trespass. Also ask the police to write down any admissions of guilt/liability/negligence the family makes towards the police, and forward the police report to your insurance and/or CPS if applicable.", "I was going to say. Waiver might be worse than useless and then they might say \u201cwell OP said the kids can play here, we thought they were supervising\u201d. Slippery slope to hell for sure", "What a depressing way to look at life.", "You know what, good for you. Everyone is dogging you for letting the kids play there when they have no other green space close to play in. I definitely think it's smart to cover your butt with a waiver and the insurance. \n\nBut I'll never understand people that expect everyone to hoard their money like dragons. Why have all that money if you're not willing to help people. Kids don't need millions of dollars when their parents pass away but there are plenty of other people who do. \n\nEdit: a word", "This is a lawsuit waiting to happen, if kids get injured.\n\nAnd though in the comments you are sure you can buy out all your neighbours, it depends on the nature of the injuries whether you could be tied up in months/years of legal action, and a number of your neighbours becoming hostile.\n\nIf you keep the ban, NTA.", "Your neighbours are something else. The audacity.. I am truly speechless.\n\nGlad to read you're getting cameras and taking next steps to protect yourself from these awful people.", "NTA. Cameras and liability waiver is a good idea.", "NTA. Honestly I\u2019d think it\u2019d cost more to fix all that. My parents were quoted 30k+ to replace their windows and they only have like 10 windows \ud83d\ude35\n\nAlso those saying to put a fence seem to missed the size of a property, putting a fence on 2 acres would be like 50k", "NTA\n\nYou need to sue the parents in small claims though", "I think it\u2019s very kind to let the kids use your yard but considering the risks involved it doesn\u2019t seem worth it. What do you get out of this? I grew up in the city. Kids find places to play. NTA", "So the OP should just give in?  If these asshole want to escalate the police should be involved and they can deal with the long term consequences of being shitty parents.", "The OP wouldn\u2019t automatically be responsible for a kids injury just because it happened on her property. There would have to be some negligence on her part.", "BTW a liability waiver doesn't do much as you're creating an attractive nuisance if a child gets hurt on something or by something. Your home owners could also, thus, refuse to cover you or increase rates. Be very careful. It seems like there's no issue till a kid breaks a collar bone by tripping on a sprinkler.\n\nBy allowing children over unsupervised, the argument can be made you assumed responsibility of them and they were in your care.", "NTA. Also check your state laws parents can be charged for the crimes of their children depending on the state.", "YTA.", "NTA. Put up no trespassing signs also. And take time stamped pictures of them. This was advice I received from my insurance agent a while ago.", "NTA though I do kind of feel bad for the 7yo who does not seem to be a culprit and is probably being parentified by his parents. I\u2019d definitely ban the rest of them but I wonder if allowing him to come over might afford him the opportunity to just be a kid without having to worry about his siblings? Obviously that\u2019s totally your choice either way but you seem like you want to allow the kids to enjoy the property. The parents would obviously also have to get on board but I wonder if saying \u201chey I know 7yo seems to be respectful so he can come over assuming no more damage is done and hopefully when 5yos get bigger and more responsible they can too\u201d would both cool things with the parents and allow this kid to have a good time and you to have no more damage. Just a suggestion.", "To be fair:  as a kid, I wrote other people's names on things because I didn't want to get in trouble.", "> Edit 2: I also have a meeting scheduled with my attorney to discuss the possibility of drawing up a liability waiver for the parents to sign, forgot to put that in the last edit lol.\n\nYeah, no way that will hold up, which I'm sure that that is what the attorney will tell you.", "I too am accepting donations lol", "NTA - but you should really make a rule that no kids can play in your yard if you are not there.  The kids should have to come to the door and ask politely \"can we play in your yard?\"", "NTA -  the kids are brats, the parents are not parenting, and if another kid gets cut on the broken glass, or a rock hits them thrown by one of those little monsters -- you're likely be liable.  I'd simply say \"that's it folks.  If I can't expect respect for my property, your kids can no longer play in my yard, take them to a park\".  And there are fences around that aren't ugly.", "They might be ugly but put them no matter what. I would have been the most uncivil person w that mother. Suspend kids activities in your house for until all the process is done w that woman and until your security systems have been set in your house. Make sure to ignore that ah of a mother and when the activity suspension is over, flaunt infront of the banned kids that there a not allowed in there anymore. Period. NTA. Said everything", "NTA.  The parents know their kids did the damage, but are accusing you of lying to avoid paying for it.  The kids are young now, but with parents that do not supervise or discipline, a few years from now, broken windows are going to look good compared to what they will end up doing.\n\nYou may not like them but you have to put up a fence if you want to have any type of liability waiver really hold up in court.  There are many options for fences that are economical and attractive.\n\nIf you want the neighborhood kids to play on your property then invite a supervising adult to watch as a requirement.  That truly takes most of the liability out of your hands . . . that and having your property secured, and then having them sign the waiver.  Put a few lawn chairs out there and get to know them.", "NTA If this is how the kids act, obviously, they learned it from their parents, which you stated how she was behaving with you yelling and screaming and saying not very nice things you have every right to allow who you want to play on your yard or not the parents are a holes even if they don\u2019t have that kind of money, they could work something out with you and do a payment plan I don\u2019t think you should punish all the other neighborhood kids forone asshole family I agree with you 100% that family should not be able to play in your yard until they pay for the damages they did and end of story kid will learn to respect other people\u2019s property and he\u2019ll learn to take responsibility for his actions which obviously his parents aren\u2019t teaching him. And I would 100% get security cameras for your safety and to cover your own ass", "NTA. They should pay for all that damage. Not only did they mark up your house, they doubled down and threw rocks breaking windows. Cameras or a ring would be best. Maybe motion sensor lights. Just in case this escalates, keep the police in mind, they did damage. Please don't back down OP, it's your property and if the kids got hurt or something you bet those same parents would sue. This is a hill to die on.", "The lawyer you talk to is going to tell you to put up a fence and stop letting neighborhood kids play in your yard. \n\nEven if such a liability waiver would be effective in covering you, none of these parents are going to be willing to sign it. \n\nYou\u2019re not T A but this is what you opened yourself up to, letting kids play unsupervised in your yard.", "If ur neighbour's house and the ppl that are hating on u now over this, got their house damaged by kids, I'm sure they won't allow them kids to come over ever again until their parents paid for their damage.\n\n Good on u for standing ur ground!!!!\n\n OP not the AH", "How do you know those kids did it though?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m kind of surprised that the other parents weren\u2019t supportive of you. Did you show them the damage, or photos of the damage? \n\nJust surprised that the other parents didn\u2019t realize that close to $1000 of damage might get kids banned. I wonder what they would do if their kids caused damage to the OP\u2019s property.", "That's not what the quote means.  It's from a Robert Frost poem, and he's saying good fences make good neighbors because with stone fences, both neighbors need to cooperate to work together to keep the fences in good shape.", "It\u2019s not the same world anymore. When we were kids, people pulled over for funerals and waved to the fellow driver who let them out. When is the last time you saw either of those happen?", ":( thank you for trying to do right by those kids. It\u2019s so sad that the institutions meant to protect kids so often fall short.", "A slight variation,  but makes it true today.", "NTA. But these neighbours definitely are. Need to take tougher action. And tell your other neighbours that if it cannot be solved and your damage paid for that you may have to ban all children. Up to them to back you up or not.", "NTA but honestly after that trouble and then the other parents being upset, no one else would be allowed to come. I saw you mentioned fences are ugly, but what about something more natural looking like hedges?", "NTA.  Very simple.", "NTA Their homeowners insurance will pay the claim under liability since it was their child that did it. That's what coverage is there for. I'd kick them out of my yard too.", "Definitely record everything and sue the family and try to pretend to for pain and suffering money as well but try act understanding and say but id be willing to negotiate if the entire family seeks a years worth of counseling.", "NTA", "INFO: Before the siding damage and the broken windows, when it was just the sharpie, and you were asking them to pay to fix it, what exactly were you asking for? Were you going to hire a painter to come out and match the paint and paint over it? Sharpie can be removed for free with rubbing alcohol and a rag. When you approached them asking for money, they probably thought you were overstating the cost to repair (which if it was just Sharpie would have been very little).", "Idk if this is possible, but talk to CPS? If they are letting kids do whatever, they probably have no consequences to there actions.

And if one video stops, the next one gets triggered right away (if I want it to, depends on the settings)", "Jesus Christ, not being a native speaker sure is funny sometimes. I was legit wondering why you would have to insure an umbrella... And why tf would you have an umbrella on your driveway in the first place?\nThanks for making me laugh about myself :D", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. This is a simple case of not wanting to pay $20 so you have to pay several hundred.  As my old boss used to say, \"stupid should hurt\".", "NTA, but I really don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re willing  to put yourself through so much grief for the pleasure of this abuse and liability. IMO a good fence, cameras, and no trespassing signs are in order. Seems like you\u2019re willing to bend over backwards to let a bunch of jerks use your backyard as the neighborhood playground. Maybe some therapy/personal exploration is in order to figure out why this is.", "This is the moment those parents became the As. Not too late for the kids though, if only the parents turn towards accountability.", "Using indicators or only overtaking on the left also really fell out of fashion, I can see that getting much worse within the last 10-15 years.\nI really cherish our neighbours. They are awesome.", "Where the heck did you get that from? It's a freaking lawn, not a cave system or moor or full of tall structures to climb on. If someone trips and falls, that would not be OP's fault (morally). It's not like OP is letting the kids ride his/her horses with reckless abandon... OP is adding no real danger to their lives or limbs by letting them run around a freaking yard.\n\nAt no point did OP act flippant towards anyone's suffering, they merely replied to concerns about monetary issues.", "Maybe but I've ready too much case law to delude myself there aren't some vicious souls out there."]}
