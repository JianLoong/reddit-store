{"id": 3071, "submission_id": "z30a4k", "title": "AITA for not letting my neighbors kids play in my yard until they pay to fix damage to my house?", "selftext": "My father bought the house in the 80s and held onto it as different developments sprung up around it. I inherited it 3 years ago and have been living in it since. I have 2 acres while my surrounding neighbors have maybe 1/2 an acre if they\u2019re lucky. The house is fairly small (2 bed 2 bath) so I have a very large front and back yard. I use maybe 1/5th of the backyard as a garden and the rest is basically an empty field. I\u2019ve always loved kids so I was happy to let my neighbors kids play in the field with the understanding that they would respect the property. Most of the kids are great, very respectful and understand that this is not their backyard. The problem is with my neighbors to the right.\n\nThey have 5 kids (f1, m3, m5, f5 and m7) who generally run around unsupervised. They don\u2019t come to my yard to play very often unless the other kids are playing soccer or baseball. The 7 year old is \u201cin charge\u201d as much as a 7 year old can be but obviously he can\u2019t replace parental supervision. 5 days ago the kids were playing baseball and he must have lost track of the 5 year olds at some point because when I came home from work I found their names sharpied onto my wall (name and name were here) along with some rude drawings (a man pooping, several piles of poop, that sort of thing) all along the right side of the house.\n\nI found their parents the next day and asked them to pay for the paint I\u2019ll need to cover it up, they were very offended, accused me of lying and said they weren\u2019t going to pay. If this had been all I probably would\u2019ve let it slide and covered the paint since it would only be like 20 dollars but later that day m5 decided it would be funny to throw rocks at my house. There are several dents in the siding where the rocks hit and two of my windows are broken. From what I\u2019ve been quoted to fix it it\u2019s about $800-$900 worth of damage. I talked to the parents who accused me of doing it myself to make their kids look bad. \n\nI\u2019ve decided those 5 are not allowed to use my yard until the damage is paid for, which I think is more than fair. When they came by this morning to play soccer with the other kids I politely explained the situation and said they would have to leave as they aren\u2019t allowed to play here anymore. The 7 year old was very upset (more sad than a temper tantrum which is understandable) but the 5 year olds were very angry. About an hour later their mom came by and cussed me out, yelling at my doorstep about how I\u2019m a horrible person who hates children because I\u2019m \u201cbitter and can\u2019t find a husband\u201d. I\u2019m standing my ground either way but a few other parents came by and seemed a little frustrated by my explanation as to why that family is no longer welcome which is making me question things.

Let those destructive little kids play in the yards of the of the families who are frustrated your yard is now off limits.  Put up cameras and when you catch property destructing in progress, call the cops and then sue the parents. Even 5 year olds should know better than to do what those kids did. Poor kids, what inadequate parents they have.", "NTA \n\nIt is your property. You don\u2019t have to have a reason to tell others to stay off. \n\nThe fact that they damaged your property gives you cause to not just politely ask them to pay for repairs, but to press charges and sue for damages. \n\nYou have AH neighbors. Put up security cameras. Call the police if they continue trespassing. Sue for damages.  \n\nI broke a neighbors window accidentally growing up, my parents offered to pay for the damages or have me work off the cost of the repairs doing chores for the neighbor. They split the difference. My parents paid half and I did yard work for the neighbor all summer. Plus, a bunch of extra chores for my parents to repay them. \n\nMy kids accidentally damaged my neighbors Rise bushes one spring. Similarly, the neighbor was compensated with my kids doing yard work. \n\nParents that don\u2019t raise their kids to respect the property of others and take responsibility for their actions, accidental or intentional, are shitty people raising more shitty people. \n\nLet the legal system help address the problem.", "NTA but I'd sue for damages because with parents like those, I doubt they'll ever pay the money.", "NTA. You damage something, you aren't able to use it anymore. You're being more than generous by offering to let them continue as long as the paint is paid for.", "NTA, but you need to be very careful. As someone else suggested,you need cameras desperately.  There is no telling what can and will go on at any time while kids are playing on your property.  If someone gets hurt, you get sued. Have the kids work off the damage by doing yard work or have them clean and paint it themselves. With supervision.but cameras, please", "NTA, the parents should fix whatever the kids did. It's great that you love kids and are providing them a place to play, but you are also assuming liability if anyone gets hurt.", "NTA, this is what small claims court is for", "NTA. Time for fences and cameras.", "NTA but I\u2019d make it a rule now that no kids are allowed on your property. It\u2019s a liability issue along with the property damaged.

Then call your homeowners insurance and turn in the report so they can go after your neighbors homeowners insurance.  I suggest cameras and a fence.

Please get cameras installed to cover your entire house.

Those kids obviously are not being raised to care for others property.", "Definitely NTA\n\nTheir parents should 100% have apologized for the drawings and the damage and offered to pay for whatever needed to be fixed.  Coming over and yelling at you is even worse.\n\nAlso, what kind of crappy parents leave 5 kids all under the age of 7 to play outside by themselves?  I feel bad for the kids sounds like terrible parents.\n\nThe other thing is, you should probably stop letting any kids play in your yard anyways and put up a no trespassing sign.  As crazy as it seems, if you let them play on your property and one of them gets hurt, you could end up getting sued... that's our fantastic legal system.", "I can\u2019t believe they have 5 kids and no idea how to take responsibility for two of them. This screams GENTLE PARENTING. I\u2019m sorry for the trouble you\u2019ve had. Hope it gets resolved soon.", "NTA \n\nStand your ground. \n\nActions have consequences. \n\nThe neighborhood parents may be a bit distraught because they are afraid that your yard isn't going to be the neighborhood playground anymore.\n\nHonestly, I probably would make that the case. It seems that parents are sending their children to your lot to play unsupervised.  Should something unfortunate happen, you might be liable. At the very least, check that out.", "NTA I understand, not wanting to involve the cops and not really needing the money from them, but it is the principle of it all. By letting this go, not only you are appearing as if your doormat, but these kids are not learning any lesson. The way that Parent spoke to you, they don\u2019t deserve your niceness. \n\nTo know that their kids did it but yet still being unreasonably rude and cursing you out is very disrespectful. I highly suggest you install cameras around your property and reach out to the police and file an official complaint. The only way the parents and those children will learn If they\u2019re consequences for those actions.", "NTA - not at all\n\nBut a word of warning from my experience  ... a 'war' with children who come from families where the parents don't take responsibility or hold the kids accountable are asymmetric and almost always lost - and worse, these kids will become teens some day  ... we learned the hard way to the tune of about $3k damage to our pool and fence \n\nGood luck", "NTA. Stop letting kids play in your yard. You see how parents react when their child causes damage to your property, now imagine the damage to their own body. You would be held liable for that. Get some cameras and stop being so nice", "NTA, and I would let the parents know that I would be contacting the authorities if the kids came back on my property. They can either pay for the damage to my property, or I can file a police report.", "Get a fence, get it now. Your neighbours are a nightmare and a lawsuit waiting to happen. **NTA.**", "NTA. But I would take pictures of the damage and look at installing cctv cameras because this might escalate, also keep a diary. You can always go to the small court claims but it will be difficult to prove that it was them who broke the windows. In any case I would also report the damage to the police to have it logged.", "N T A but get cameras.  I been binge watching Fear They Neighbor on Discovery and this sounds like a potentially rough situation that having evidence is important but maybe not aggressive cameras that make you look aggressive.  Just small even hidden ones", "NTA.  Letting people, particularly unsupervised children, onto your yard is a liability.  Just don't do it.", "Am sorry, but your asking for trouble here.\n\nYour letting a bunch of kids, literally babies and toddlers play on your property without supervision. They injure themselves on your property, who is getting the blame? You. \n\nUnless ANY of the kids parents are present I wouldn't let them play there. Does it suck? Yes. But they do have their own gardens to play in. 1/2 acre is *plenty* of space! \n\nNTA for banning them, but I think you need to think more logically about any potential risk factors you might have overlooked previously. Also, get cameras.", "NTA. But I think it's time for fencing and cameras.", "I was going to suggest cameras also. If the kids know parents will back them up no matter what they do, things will get more destructive as they get older.", "Unfortunately,  these kinds of stories are the reason for the adage \"Good fences make good neighbors.\"", "I think I will.

This isn\u2019t the first issue I\u2019ve had with them either (they thought it was appropriate to let the one year old play in my yard with only the 7 year old as supervision which I was NOT going to let happen) so I\u2019m not very confident in their parenting abilities either.", "It would be easier if the paint was the only issue but after the rocks the kids definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to help with the repairs. I have to have the glass replaced on two windows and if I want it back to its former glory I\u2019ll have to replace some of the siding.

Cameras seem like the next reasonable step because the parents keep escalating.", "If you go to adding more cameras, consider more coverage than just those sides. Just because those areas are closer to the neighbor doesn't mean thats where the next incident will happen.\n\nOr that it will come from one of the kids in that family. There are other kids around. They play with the other kids. Some of those kids are probably unhappy about the ban too. You know at least some of their parents are  unhappy about the ban.

This might have been low risk, until things escalated.", "Get a camera. Record and start taking them to court or use the footage to file a police complaint. This way they are forced to parent their children.", "Understood, and it\u2019s not so much them doing the actual work to fix it, but the action of doing ANY work to replace the cost. Set boundaries like -you do this work, and you can come back for x hours or days. Sounds like they need the structure for sure, but anything you do with them or their parents, make sure it\u2019s recorded. Is your property properly marked? If not, do so", "That's fine, but get cameras for around your property if you don't already have them. There's a fair chance these people will escalate and if you need the cops in future, it's better to have clear evidence.", "Then you are being a doormat. Do you think they aren't going to escalate?", "Even if you don\u2019t call the cops for the damage you can at least get them to trespass them. That will help protect you in case they try coming around again.", "Don\u2019t let people walk over you for your kindness.\n\nBe kind, but be stern when needed.", "I get not liking cops but having an official police report can be very beneficial should the situation escalate, which these people seem likely to.   \n\n\nGet cameras, definitely.   \n\n\nEither times or tough or you're well off not sure how that can be both...", "> I\u2019ll see if they\u2019d be willing to do some garden work to make up for it.\n\nThat's a really good idea, and i'm wondering if you could ask them *now* and based on their promise, let them back in your yard now.", "If you accuse someone they had to", "They won't even dust for prints on a car break-in that resulted in a gun being stolen so you're 100% correct lol\n(before anyone comes at me, I was not the dumbass that left my gun in a running car, it was my dipshit ex lol)", "I might talk to my lawyer and see about getting the parents to sign some sort of liability waiver but as it stands it\u2019s been fine like this for 3 years and I\u2019m willing to risk it.", "After my dad passed I inherited a small restaurant chain along with the house, it\u2019s probably weird to say but I\u2019d be fine taking care of the costs if someone got hurt.
