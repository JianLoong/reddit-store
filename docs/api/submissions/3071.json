I inherited it 3 years ago and have been living in it since. I have 2 acres while my surrounding neighbors have maybe 1/2 an acre if they\u2019re lucky. The house is fairly small (2 bed 2 bath) so I have a very large front and back yard. I use maybe 1/5th of the backyard as a garden and the rest is basically an empty field. I\u2019ve always loved kids so I was happy to let my neighbors kids play in the field with the understanding that they would respect the property. Most of the kids are great, very respectful and understand that this is not their backyard. The problem is with my neighbors to the right.\n\nThey have 5 kids (f1, m3, m5, f5 and m7) who generally run around unsupervised. They don\u2019t come to my yard to play very often unless the other kids are playing soccer or baseball. The 7 year old is \u201cin charge\u201d as much as a 7 year old can be but obviously he can\u2019t replace parental supervision. 5 days ago the kids were playing baseball and he must have lost track of the 5 year olds at some point because when I came home from work I found their names sharpied onto my wall (name and name were here) along with some rude drawings (a man pooping, several piles of poop, that sort of thing) all along the right side of the house.\n\nI found their parents the next day and asked them to pay for the paint I\u2019ll need to cover it up, they were very offended, accused me of lying and said they weren\u2019t going to pay. If this had been all I probably would\u2019ve let it slide and covered the paint since it would only be like 20 dollars but later that day m5 decided it would be funny to throw rocks at my house. There are several dents in the siding where the rocks hit and two of my windows are broken. From what I\u2019ve been quoted to fix it it\u2019s about $800-$900 worth of damage. I talked to the parents who accused me of doing it myself to make their kids look bad. \n\nI\u2019ve decided those 5 are not allowed to use my yard until the damage is paid for, which I think is more than fair. When they came by this morning to play soccer with the other kids I politely explained the situation and said they would have to leave as they aren\u2019t allowed to play here anymore. The 7 year old was very upset (more sad than a temper tantrum which is understandable) but the 5 year olds were very angry. About an hour later their mom came by and cussed me out, yelling at my doorstep about how I\u2019m a horrible person who hates children because I\u2019m \u201cbitter and can\u2019t find a husband\u201d. I\u2019m standing my ground either way but a few other parents came by and seemed a little frustrated by my explanation as to why that family is no longer welcome which is making me question things. AITA for banning them from playing here?\n\nEdit: to answer some common concerns\n\nI will be installing cameras, I dug my dads old trail cams out of the garage so I\u2019ll put those up either tonight or tomorrow.\n\nI am aware of the liability issues with kids playing in my yard, I\u2019m willing to risk it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to put up a fence, I think they\u2019re ugly. The property line is clearly marked.\n\nI will not be banning the entire neighborhood unless I absolutely have to.\n\nEdit 2: I also have a meeting scheduled with my attorney to discuss the possibility of drawing up a liability waiver for the parents to sign, forgot to put that in the last edit lol.", "created_utc": 1669236920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z30a4k/aita_for_not_letting_my_neighbors_kids_play_in_my/", "score": 952, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
