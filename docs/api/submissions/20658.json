Her husband received the bill for about $5.000 and he is receiving about $10.000 from her pension.

Absolutely not.

Check with a lawyer, but normally when someone inherits money some of it is for the funeral costs and to pay off any debt the deceased had incurred. He\u2019s probably obligated since he was the sole beneficiary. My step mom was when my dad passed, and she just paid it. It\u2019s not your debt, they were married.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nYou have 2 options. Get involved or walk away. \n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in participating in her financial obligations, then politely decline or just tell him to use whatever money your Mom left you. How her husband spends the money (which I doubt will be any) is none of your business & you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to do anything.\n\nIf you want to be involved then tell husband you\u2019re only willing to contribute after you get full picture of your mother\u2019s financial situation. All burial/funeral expenses come out of whatever assets she has first & then her debt gets paid, then you split the remainder. Otherwise, he\u2019s on his own to pay.

I wouldn't.", "No way. Usually it comes out of the estate. So if it can get paid out of your mother\u2019s assets that is the answer. It does not work that he gets her money and property but sticks you with the expenses. Fuck that.", "Nta lol hes such a conartist", "NTA. He got the estate and all the bills that come with it.

She was an adult, and married. You are not responsible for a single one of her bills/expenses. However you should also have NOT gotten involved in any of the funeral decisions that came with a price tag, if you were not willing to chip in for the cost of any requests that YOU may have made.  It's one thing for a relative to say that someone would like a certain song or color, but unless they are sharing the costs they shouldn't be picking anything out.
