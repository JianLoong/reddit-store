Check with a lawyer, but normally when someone inherits money some of it is for the funeral costs and to pay off any debt the deceased had incurred. He\u2019s probably obligated since he was the sole beneficiary. My step mom was when my dad passed, and she just paid it.

Get involved or walk away. \n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in participating in her financial obligations, then politely decline or just tell him to use whatever money your Mom left you. How her husband spends the money (which I doubt will be any) is none of your business & you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to do anything.\n\nIf you want to be involved then tell husband you\u2019re only willing to contribute after you get full picture of your mother\u2019s financial situation. All burial/funeral expenses come out of whatever assets she has first & then her debt gets paid, then you split the remainder. Otherwise, he\u2019s on his own to pay.

Just say no, and leave it at that.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nThe laws across the world state pretty much the same thing: The deceased's estate pays for the funeral. Essentially this means your mom pays for her own funeral. Don't let your stepfather bullshit you about what ungrateful, greedy children you are. He can choose what kind of funeral she will have, but your mom pays for it. It's not his money until the affairs of the estate are settled. That means paying off debts and the funeral and whatever remains is then distributed among the inheritors. Your stepfather is essentially trying to shake you down for money so he can walk off with a bigger inheritance. You're not violating any norms by insisting on following standard procedure.\n\nIf you fear he will arrange a pauper's burial then you could offer to handle the funeral. If he's shite with paperwork he might agree out of convenience. Make very clear to him in writing the estate will be billed.", "Really the only answer. Don't even need to get personal about it.", "Exactly. When my grandmother passed away, my mom was her executor. She paid for all the necessary arrangements and any remaining fees from the hospital/assisted living from the estate, and once everything was taken care of the remaining money was divided between my grandmother\u2019s heirs. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. If OP\u2019s stepdad is the sole heir, then he should be paying for the funeral arrangements out of the money he\u2019s receiving.", "Yes this. The estate should cover it. That's absolutely insane that he'll use her money/assets to buy himself a new car, but not to cover the expenses of burying her. What an ass. do not give him a penny OP. And request a copy of her will, because if she left you and sister anything, I wouldn't put it past his cheap ass to try to keep if from you. NTA. Sorry for your loss."]}
