If it\u2019s your home as much as his, why aren\u2019t you being consulted prior to having guests over? \n\nThis sounds so draining to me, and I\u2019m a social introvert. You need alone time and you need to talk to your husband. He\u2019s acting like it\u2019s his house. \n\n\u201cHey I\u2019m having friends over and you\u2019re just gonna have to deal with it. You\u2019ll also have to entertain them and clean up after us btw. Fuck your weekend and any plans you may have.\u201d Sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it?", "NTA, his friends, he's the host. Leave him to stock the fridge, change the beds etc. Find somewhere peaceful to go and have a break. Perhaps he'll realise how much work it is if he actually does it himself.", "NTA\n\nremember this is all coming out of your household budget.\n\nTell him enough is enough. No more parties for the time being.", "Nope NTA. Your husband is just being selfish and childish. If its his home as much as yours then why doens't he  stock up the fridge, clean up before and after visits, changing sheets, picking up everything and doing all the dishes etc. \n\nStop living your life just to support his, you are your own person. If you don't feel like socializing with his friends then don't.  Its okay to make your own plans.", "NTA\n\n>I'm constantly having to stock up the fridge, clean up before and after visits, changing sheets, picking up everything and doing all the dishes\n\nWhy are you the one running around after your husband and his friends? Is he physically incapable of doing the housework or something?\n\n>It's his home as much as mine.\n\nYour husband is not showing you the same consideration. He's forcing you into a live-in maid role in your own home, which he has turned into an almost constant party venue for his friends, and clearly doesn't care that you're uncomfortable with it. Getting angry at you for simply asking him to reduce the amount of get-togethers at your house is a huge red flag, too.\n\nFirst you need to make it clear to your husband that you will no longer be responsible for prepping, hosting and cleaning up after his parties. Then you need to take some time to reflect on whether your husband's behaviour is concentrated on this issue alone or is part of a larger problem. Frankly, it wouldn't shock me if you came to the realisation that his selfishness is present in other areas of your marriage", "OP, I am going to give you a new Mantra, which will bring peace and serenity into a life that has become chaotic.  It goes like this:\n\n\"YOU do it.\"  \"This was your idea, YOU do it.\"  \"If you want the guest room cleaned and dinner cooked for your buddies, YOU dot it\".  \n\nRepeat as needed.", "NTA. Did he lose his arms in a terrible accident? He can pitch in with shopping and cleaning. This doesn\u2019t sound very economical, always footing the bill. First off, discuss limiting the friend visits again. Remind him it\u2019s your house, too. Second, who says you have to do all the work? Just don\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your house as well. It\u2019s not fair to you to feel uncomfortable in your own place.  If your husband got angry for such a petition\u2026girl\u2026big red flag there", "NTA. He isn't helping out with the prep and cleaning, make him do it see how much he'll like it.", "NTA. You both get to decide about guests in YOUR shared home. He doesn't get to impose on you. And it's not your job to prepare the house for or clean up after his invited guests. He needs to do 100% of those household chores (and 50% of other ones).", "NTA if your husband wants regular guests over then it's about time he hosts and does all the clean up bet he'll soon change his tune about it always being at your place. Next time make your own plans and go out so he has to deal with it", "NTA\n\nAlso concerning that he immediately reacted with anger when you asked him to cool it off for a bit. Is this new behaviour or does he always throw the toys out of the pram whenever you attempt to bring something up that he disagrees with?", "NTA for all the reasons people said. However, if he\u2019s not gonna budge on this I\u2019d just \u201cgo on strike\u201d. My partner has this friend who used to be at our house like literally every afternoon. He\u2019d come round at like 4:30 and hang out until supper and either eat with us or only leave then. (This guy is married, it\u2019s not like he has nowhere to go). So I said to my bf that I\u2019m ok with his friend there but I\u2019m 1) not hosting/pouring drinks/getting snacks 2) not socializing. When the friend came round I\u2019d carry on doing my own thing. The number of visits has slowed down significantly since then and now when he\u2019s round once a week I actually don\u2019t mind fixing some snacks and making a drink or two. So yeah - if he wants to have people round fair enough but then that\u2019s his personal problem.", "Go away for the weekend to a friend or relatives, do not shop or do anything for his party before you go, if he freaks out on you don\u2019t go back. Marriage is a partnership, your his wife, not an indentured servant.", "NTA. Although it's both of your homes, he's the one inviting people over, you are doing all the host duties. He's making a lot of extra work for you, and not really  showing any appreciation for what you do. \nI also wonder whether he really likes to indulge in the substances mentioned, and a party is a good excuse to do those things more often?", "NTA", "NTA you live there too.", "NTA. if he wants to have people over constantly then he should be the one cleaning up after them.", "NTA, your husband should be cleaning and providing for his friends who come over.", "NTA. But you need to stop stocking the fridge, cleaning before and after. Go do your thing. If he\u2019s hosting then he needs to prepare and clean up after. You chill out. Maybe take yourself away for the weekend? Maybe by yourself or with friends? But it\u2019s vital you stop enabling his laziness. He needs to deal with hosting in it entirety. From beginning to end so don\u2019t get involved and let him do the work. It appears he doesn\u2019t care to compromise and his needs are more important than yours. So you need to take action now so he can see how tiring it is for you. You\u2019re making it too easy for him so he\u2019s walking all over you and taking advantage of your kindness unfortunately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I agree with all of the comments regarding you unjustly carrying the load but I think the matter is deeper. It sounds like you\u2019re feeling an imbalance in priorities in your marriage. It\u2019s still acceptable (and good) to have fun with friends while married but it\u2019s a balance. It sounds like you two are out of balance. If you\u2019re both working during the week the weekend is prime time for you to connect and have fun together. That balance fills you up as a couple and makes you feel good about the time your SO wants to do other things (which is acceptable with that balance). \n\nYou didn\u2019t share how long youve been married but this kind of issue wouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary for a recently married young couple. Your case seems extreme though. \n\nYour husband is either unaware that your marriage needs that balance or is unwilling to find it. It sounds like he wants to live the single life and be married at the same time. You two should try to get on the same page by being honest about what each of you need and envision for this stage in your life. Compromise by giving a little (you\u2019re giving too much right now IMO) on each end, see how that works, and re-evaluate as circumstances change.", "NTA - and lots of good advice here. My spouse and I had this same dynamic (although she is the social one and I\u2019m in your shoes). We\u2019ve reached a point where we a) discuss before, b) limit to no more than one big thing a week, c) she puts more effort into doing the prep and after-clean, d) she invites my \u201cno, I need more alone/quiet-time time this week\u201d response, e) have a regular scheduled evening for just the 2 of us, and f) she put more effort into doing social events out of apartment.", "NTA - why can\u2019t he help out with all that?", "NTA\n\nHis guests. He does the work. He cleans. He cooks. He stocks the fridge. Don't lift a finger", "NTA\u2026why are you doing all the work for his friends?  Why are you providing the food and drinks?  Stop.  He wants them over.  He does the work, puts in the time.  Maybe you should tell him, if his hanging out with his friends is more important to him than you having time in your own home, maybe he should rethink where he wants to live.  This is your home too.  You are not saying he cannot hang out with his friends, but not all the freakin time in your home!  That you do all the work for and he does nothing!  You are not his mother and he is not a teenage boy.  Also, you don\u2019t have to entertain all the time.  Say hello, and go to the quiet of your room.  Don\u2019t provide anything.  They are big boys.  They can figure it out.  You are not the TA", "Well, you can\u2019t make anyone do anything, but you can certainly stop doing it yourself. \n\nYes, there will be a cost/inconvenience to you of having the house dirty or the fridge empty, but with some thinking you can reduce that and then it will be a matter of choosing the least inconvenient alternative"]}
