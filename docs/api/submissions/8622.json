I didn\u2019t want to sell, but after looking at what we\u2019ve put into the house versus the market value, I was reluctantly willing.  The house has appreciated over $140k in value.  This is based on market changes, the value we bought it at and our improvements over the years.  \n\nWe met them at the home in question to discuss.  When we told them what the house is worth and what we were asking, S lost it.  He started telling us how much they\u2019d paid in rent over the years and how they\u2019ve been great tenants.  He also brought up how much we bought it for.  Prior to our meeting, my wife and I had agreed to offer the house at 5k under market value.  Which I think is a huge gift to people we don\u2019t know all that well and have only had a business relationship with.  \n\nS went on to accuse us (mostly me) of being predatory and money hungry.  He was yelling and standing up.  He \u201ccounter offered\u201d a number that was basically what we\u2019ve put into the house total.  I told him that his tone was disrespectful and his offer was ridiculous.  I also called him an entitled man-child.  Cooler heads prevailed and we ended up leaving without any kind of agreement on how to move forward.  \n\nMy wife and I are in agreement that the offer to sell to them is off the table, but now we\u2019re both open to just putting it on the market when their lease is up.  \n\nI\u2019ve talked about it with a few friends and some family with mixed results.

They are the ones that decided to rent a house instead of buying. They are adults. \n\nI can't believe I need to type this but everyone understands that owning a house ends up cheaper in the long run and potentially building equity, however you are then tied to one place and have a big financial commitment and all the risks associated with that. Many aren't in a position to make that commitment, many more don't have the deposit required for a mortgage or the financial buffer to cover things like a new roof if required. This is not your fault or responsibility. You do not owe them anything, a $5k discount was generous enough. \n\nYour tenants have shown themselves to be unhinged and entitled. I STRONGLY suggest that you get them out of your house as soon as possible. They are likely to do something bonkers to try and reduce the value of the house and force a sale to them. Or just do something to be mean. \n\nThey are not to be trusted, and they are currently sitting in your biggest asset.

Get rid of them as soon as legally possible, so you can get the house ready for showings.", "NTA There are tenants that start seeing a property as their own, that their rent is paying the house off and building equity that is rightfully theirs. They are not good tenants. Get them out as soon as you can, as that attitude becomes a dangerous delusion that you owe them, that they 'deserve' the property more than you do. They can even start, 'no one else can have it, if they can't.' They have lost all respect for you as landlords. Get rid of them as soon as you possibly can, because he will escalate. I grew up with my parent's friends renting out many properties, childhood friends of mine renting out property and we ourselves rent out property, so I have seen this scenario before. Do not renew the contract and get them out. Get them out before selling it as they will wreck the place if they know it is for sale.", "NTA\n\nHow much you paid for the house is not relevant.  Do they ask the grocery store how much the grocer paid for bananas before buying them? \n\nYou offered them a fair price. They declined.

Likewise, there were three months they didn't pay the mortgage for you, because you allowed them to live rent-free.

He should have haggled and not insult you.\n\nJust sell it.", "Nta but I have empathy for your tenant. The housing market is tough. Bought a house for 250 in 2020, and now it would sell for around 350. It sucks but it's not your fault.", "NTA it's ridiculous how small landlords are considered \"evil\" somehow on here.  Like paying rent is some sort of hardship and you are committing a crime by God forbid owning property.\n\nYou haven't been overcharging them, you've been doing the maintenance and repairs, you've even forgiven 3 months rent yet somehow *you* are the bad guy because you aren't giving away money by selling at a house to them for far less than it's market value.  \n\nPaying rent is the cost of having a roof over your head if you can't afford to get into the housing market. It's not throwing money away, it's paying to not be homeless.  \n\nI am completely against corporate greed and slumlords.  I think housing should be more affordable all around.  But this growing sentiment that people deserve things for free simply because others have more is absurd.  You don't go to the grocery store and simply walk out with a cart full of food.  You don't go to a car dealership and just drive a car off the lot.  You don't go into a store and walk out with a TV and clothes.  You don't pull into a gas station and fill up your car and simply drive away.  You can't buy a house and refuse to pay the mortgage or taxes.

Not even morally as renting is really very well defined in pretty much every culture and you pay to have exclusive use of a property for X amount of time and that's it.\n\nNow asking for a price and then arguing already paid rent constitutes some form of implied prepayment for the purchase is actually quite insulting and also very stupid. But there is one argument for a discount in such situations which I think holds water and that is the entire process of seller and purchaser knowing each other and being able to skip realtor-fees plus the purchaser knowing the property from having lived in it really means there should be a lot less hassle in getting the sale over the line. Now you can value that any way you want but I, personally, would have valued that at more than $5000 but that is an individual choice with no right or wrong value.", "NTA. Rent is just that - rent for being able to stay somewhere. It is not a installment plan on purchasing the place. The housing market has appreciated since you bought your home.

So you negotiate the amount of rent that would be allocated as well as the purchase price. But that is specifically bargained for and the terms are set forth so obviously simply paying rent doesn't give one any financial interest.\n\nIn terms of a discount, while $5000 seems fair you could also calculate a discount based on how much you would save by not using a broker and having to pay the typical 6% commission - or a discount for not having any contingencies - i.e. buyer agrees to waive inspection for example.", "My blood boiled!!

It sucks that none of that counts towards a mortgage / equity but they knew that going in and to demand that change without equal compensation is foolish and unlikely. On the other hand I do disagree with the principle of people owning \"investment properties\" since my country and city in particular has had their housing market heavily damaged by them, so much so current estimates for people graduating university are that it will take them until they're in their 50's before they can afford a downpayment.\n\nIf you're going to put it on the market just give them a heads up when you do so they can try and get a downpayment together.
