I\u2019ve had a few people ask for an update, but life got hectic so I kind of forgot until now. \n\nI tried my hardest to come up with a compromise using your suggestions and advice. Getting more locks to secure the enclosures, offering to never take the snakes out of the enclosures with her or the baby around, etc. My dad\u2019s partner wasn\u2019t willing to compromise and find a middle ground, and my dad kind of chose to be neutral. \n\nI ended up in with my mom and her partner over the summer. They rented a uhaul and helped me transfer my snakes and enclosures to their house. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted because I liked my school and liked living with my dad, but it\u2019s fine and I like my new school and have already met some cool people here, and I\u2019m able to handle my snakes whenever I want. Overall it worked out and it\u2019s a better environment to be in. \n\nMy dad\u2019s partner moved in with my dad shortly after I moved out and had their baby towards the end of summer. They still live together, but they\u2019ve broken up since then and I\u2019m not really sure how long they plan to live together. My grandmother told me they\u2019re just focusing on the baby and co-parenting right now. \n\nSorry if this wasn\u2019t a very satisfying update, but I thought I\u2019d write one now while I remember.

Go figure.\n\nGlad to hear everything seems to be going well at your mom's though, even if it wasn't originally what you wanted.", "Probably once you and the snakes were gone then she started making ultimatums in other parts of their life with no compromises.", "I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t able to stay with your dad and at your school.  It sounds like you are handling this in a mature way.  Best wishes to you.", "Kudos to you for embracing such a big life change in order to keep your pets. This truly shows your maturity. Thank you for the update!", "We appreciate the update on your beautiful danger noodles.  Too bad it didn't work out at your dad's house, but glad you're doing well in your new and improved environment.", "So in trying to not lose his son or girlfriend, he managed to lose both.\n\nIronic, isn\u2019t it?", "I remember this story and wondered what happened afterward. I\u2019m really glad you got to keep your snakes, but it\u2019s awful that you had to move out of your own home. Thankfully, you seem to be managing well. NTA then or now.\n\nThat being said, shame on the father for not trying harder. The fact that you had to move nine hours away and spend money on the U-Haul says a lot. He should have put his foot down. Let this be a lesson to others about what not standing your ground gets you.", "I'm glad you and your noodles are together and safe. You handled everything maturely.\n\nFrankly it seems like she just wanted you out and the snakes were an excuse.", "So he ended up being \"neutral,\" chose his partner, and still ended the relationship. I love the irony.", "It felt like the partner was trying to get rid of both you and the sneks tbh and I\u2019m disappointed she got her way. I\u2019m also sorry for your father had to go through it all as well, he was put in a very difficult place and I\u2019m sure he regrets how things went with you. Someone like that can\u2019t have been pleasant to live with, and he lost his son in the process. She sounds horrid and I\u2019m glad she is no longer in your life OP. I wish you the best in school and in your new home!", "Sorry that you had to leave a school that  you liked, but glad that you're still with your snakes!", "I feel like your dad would\u2019ve fought way harder for you if his ex-partner wasn\u2019t pregnant. \n\nNot necessarily an excuse since he *should\u2019ve* put his foot down, but with worrying about the mother\u2019s and the baby\u2019s health and the fear of being shamed about \u201cchoosing snakes over the safety of his unborn child\u201d (which wasn\u2019t the case but would surely be misconstrued as such), he folded.\n\nI\u2019m happy the romantic relationship between them ended, but man, he still has to co-parent with her. Bittersweet.", "Seems like dad woke up and realized he gave away his kid. Hopefully he won\u2019t make the same mistake twice.", "OPs dad should have read the writing on the wall before she was in his house. With any luck the nightmare that getting her out is going to be will teach him a valuable lesson of thinking with the brain in his head instead of the one in his pants.", "\"Danger noodles\" - I am totally going to steal this.  Props for awesome!", "Are they danger noodles or \"just\" snekky sneks?", "He didn't \"lose\" his son, he gave him up.  Big difference.", "Nah, they're \"boop noodles\". Danger noodles are the nope ropes.", "Danger Noodles sounds like a band name", "I'd say ball pythons are danger noodles, but the corn snake is more of a cute little snek.
