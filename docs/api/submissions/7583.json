I\u2019ve had a few people ask for an update, but life got hectic so I kind of forgot until now. \n\nI tried my hardest to come up with a compromise using your suggestions and advice. Getting more locks to secure the enclosures, offering to never take the snakes out of the enclosures with her or the baby around, etc. My dad\u2019s partner wasn\u2019t willing to compromise and find a middle ground, and my dad kind of chose to be neutral. \n\nI ended up in with my mom and her partner over the summer. They rented a uhaul and helped me transfer my snakes and enclosures to their house. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted because I liked my school and liked living with my dad, but it\u2019s fine and I like my new school and have already met some cool people here, and I\u2019m able to handle my snakes whenever I want. Overall it worked out and it\u2019s a better environment to be in. \n\nMy dad\u2019s partner moved in with my dad shortly after I moved out and had their baby towards the end of summer. They still live together, but they\u2019ve broken up since then and I\u2019m not really sure how long they plan to live together. My grandmother told me they\u2019re just focusing on the baby and co-parenting right now. \n\nSorry if this wasn\u2019t a very satisfying update, but I thought I\u2019d write one now while I remember.

I\u2019m really glad you got to keep your snakes, but it\u2019s awful that you had to move out of your own home. Thankfully, you seem to be managing well. NTA then or now.\n\nThat being said, shame on the father for not trying harder. The fact that you had to move nine hours away and spend money on the U-Haul says a lot.

I\u2019m also sorry for your father had to go through it all as well, he was put in a very difficult place and I\u2019m sure he regrets how things went with you. Someone like that can\u2019t have been pleasant to live with, and he lost his son in the process. She sounds horrid and I\u2019m glad she is no longer in your life OP. I wish you the best in school and in your new home!", "Sorry that you had to leave a school that  you liked, but glad that you're still with your snakes!", "I feel like your dad would\u2019ve fought way harder for you if his ex-partner wasn\u2019t pregnant. \n\nNot necessarily an excuse since he *should\u2019ve* put his foot down, but with worrying about the mother\u2019s and the baby\u2019s health and the fear of being shamed about \u201cchoosing snakes over the safety of his unborn child\u201d (which wasn\u2019t the case but would surely be misconstrued as such), he folded.\n\nI\u2019m happy the romantic relationship between them ended, but man, he still has to co-parent with her. Bittersweet.", "Seems like dad woke up and realized he gave away his kid. Hopefully he won\u2019t make the same mistake twice.", "OPs dad should have read the writing on the wall before she was in his house.

The snakes ultimatum was a glaring red flag.", "I find a lot of people who try to be neutral and keep everyone happy often end up making almost no one happy. \n\nOr they out themselves as a soft target and keep getting pushed around by certain people. \n\nBoundaries and standing up for yourself at least helps you chose a side or a hill to die on. Imagine losing so much because you couldn\u2019t speak up when it mattered.", "Then he probably should have ended the relationship before letting her move in, and before discarding his son to move nine hours away. He should have chosen his son over someone who was 100% unwilling to compromise.", "I wouldn't give the dad that much credit.", "Well, considering she wouldn't let the infant be in the house at all with the snakes there it was kind of a one-or-the-other situation. But yeah, letting the GF get her way was NOT being neutral, it was his house, and he stepped back from someone who didn't live there, so yeah, he took his side and then got to live with her. Fun for him /s. Served him right though. Hope the kid grows up to love reptiles.", "So much this. In my experience, 99% of the time \"staying neutral\" is actually just \"allowing something shitty to happen that you could have prevented because you didn't want to confront something/someone difficult\"\n\n\"Neutral\" isn't an option when you're on a beach and a tsunami is coming. Like you can say \"I don't know whether or not I should run\", and you can deliberate on that while standing in place.

She will probably come back as one of those freezer mice in another lifetime.", "OP I am glad to hear you and your sneks found a place and feel welcome. You dealt with this all very well all things considered. And it\u2019s nice you got the help from your mom and her partner.\n\nReally disappointed of your dad. He made an issue that shouldn\u2019t have been something for you to worry about, but between two adults. While it sucks you had to move, I don\u2019t think it was a very healthy environment to be in anyway. \n\nWishing you and your noodles a better life at your new place.", "I'm so glad you didnt rehome your snakes! Although I probably would still be resentful considering you upended your entire life only for them to break up a few months later.", "I mean, you weren't handling vipers or elapids (in which case I agree with the girlfriend) and very large boas can be dangerous but if they weren't venomous and weren't huge and allowed to wander freely... as someone whose daughter is interested in spiders I don't see the problem.  Nta and I'm glad you're ok.", "Good update. I wish you success in your new environment, home, and school. Insane how he allowed the GF to manipulate him like that at his age, but men have fought wars over women who were seeing them both. I have always lived by the mantra of my parents, who taught me how to not parent because they both were horrible at it. Now, I'm not saying your parents are bad, but remember how you feel having to move and why, then take that lesson with you into parenthood when you get there.", "I didn\u2019t get a chance to read the original but I sounds like by staying neutral your dad picked her. Thank god it didn\u2019t work out cause he would\u2019ve kept choosing her.", "Wow, your dad sucks.  And don't let him pull this 'neutral' bs. He choose a side. Her side.", "Auto yes. You\u2019re a snake person", "That really sucks man. I never owned snakes, but I actually worked with them for a few years. People dont realize how docile a lot of pet snakes are. My only experience with aggressive snakes were ones obtained from the wild. Even then people dont realize how little damage a snake can do unless they\u2019re very large. The corn snake and boa pythons I spent time with were very sweet and chill.", "This was a good update, and I\u2019m glad your mom stepped in.  Your dad should not have played neutral.  The girlfriend was being unreasonable.  I\u2019m not used to snakes, but I\u2019d respect it and try to learn.  I have a real and sincere phobia to spiders, but I\u2019d have willingly accepted compromises rather than alienate my SO\u2019s son or take his pets from him.  And I\u2019d try to work on that phobia!  It\u2019s the least I could do!\n\nI am inseparable from my dog, so I respect that those who love their snakes and spiders deserve to feel the same way and have that relationship respected!  I\u2019m glad you have your beloved pets and are liking your new school.  That\u2019s a hard move to make, but I think I would have done the same in your position.\n\nI\u2019m also not surprised the relationship didn\u2019t work out, honestly!", "I remember your original post! Glad that you and your snakes weren't separated :)", "I don't understand the gf.

You seem like a nice kid.", "\"Ha\" is what I said in my head too lol", "Not just fuss but real ultimatums that made OP uproot their whole life. Sucks that OP\u2019s dad decided to play Switzerland, and couldn\u2019t be enough of a decent parent/adult to tell his gf no.

That dad did the right thing in telling her no.", "Inevitable certainly!  But irony often works that way!", "Owning a snake is a big commitment. They live for a decade or more.

Well done, OP!", "I imagine you are right!", "I love how english allow you to say things like danger noodles", "People who are ignorant of snakes think all snakes are dangerous.

It's never easy. But there are things he can do.", "Yeah but with custody that only really happens after the birth.  So if she moves states away while pregnant she can't be compelled to move back which makes maintaining a lot of time with the baby very difficult for the father.  After the birth when custody is being worked out usually you can have it so the custodial parent can't legally move away whenever they want.", "The update clearly said she had the baby, so worrying about her pregnancy rights don't matter.

Glad you're enjoying your new situation!", "I\u2019m sad she was not willing to get to know the snakes. I get that fears are a thing, but this also reminds me of a cool story. \n\nWhen we were 20, my sister had an apartment and a friend fell on hard times and wanted to live with her. But sis had a Kenyan sand boa and Ranbow boa. Said friend was scared of the snakes. \n\nOr she used to be, 20 years later she is off doing work in conserving native snakes and working on her PhD is herpetology.", "See what happens you\u2019re mean, she\u2019s not even with him anymore.

Someone on the original thread said that OP\u2019s snakes are his babies and just as important, which is extremely delusional on many levels. We all love our pets, but no matter how much snake owners may delude themselves, snakes simply do not possess the mental or emotional capacity for true affection. We can\u2019t even compare them to dogs or cats, not because they\u2019re not so cuddly but because this is literally a fact. This whole thing is wild to me. No pun intended.

Hence the lose lose.\n\nVery easy to say he should've done the latter in hindsight, but 8 months ago their relationship almost assuredly was completely different due to them not living together.

Then, if we were brave, we could touch it. I (f) did so, Fred was my friend and I trusted him. The boa was silky smooth and dry, never did anything frightening. It was a great experience, year after year.\n\nI'm so sorry for this experience, having your entire life uprooted for no good reason. Even more painful because your dad didn't support you, and you had to leave your home. I hope you will continue to meet cool people and find support in your new home. You have my respect and best wishes!", "Sounds like a good outcome! Would love to see more pics of your sneks:-)", "They broke up already? I am so...(checks script)...surprised.", "Well well well - hope your dad is happy. What a crud move on his part.", "I am glad you are happy and I hope the GF that forced so much change in your life gets smacked upside the head with the karma she deserves for her actions.  Hopefully the new baby grows up to adore snakes too.", "All that fuss and they broke up months later? I wonder if the GF didn\u2019t have you to be a target that she then started finding reasons to be upset at your dad", "I have to admit that I have been terrified of snakes since I was about 4 yo. A snake somehow managed to get into the bathroom via the small hole in the floor where the pipes came up from under the house. (It was a very old house and this bathroom had been added after the house was built.) It managed to  drape itself across the sink behind the faucet and handles-probably trying to get a drink. But it scared me so badly that I fainted and I have been terrified of them ever since. \n\nThat being said, when my oldest son was a senior he took some of his graduation money and bought himself a young ball python. I didn\u2019t like it but said as long as he kept it and it\u2019s enclosure in his room it would be okay. On the first night it got out. I woke up at 5 a.m. and my husband wasn\u2019t in bed. I could hear voices coming from my son\u2019s bedroom & when I started walking down the hall, I could hear my son & husband moving stuff around and they said Angel escaped her enclosure. I got dressed in 10 minutes & went to work (even though I didn\u2019t have to be there till 9. And I told them I would not be home until the snake was found & the enclosure fortified!\n\nMy son joined the National Guard & my husband took care of his snake while he was in boot camp. We eventually moved the enclosure into the den & sometimes my husband would take her out & let her move around the room & as long as she didn\u2019t come in my direction I was okay. \n\nI overcame my fear of snakes by watching her, and how docile she was when she was handled. And whenever my son came near the enclosure she would perk up. If he took her out & put her around his neck, she would always rub his cheek with her head. Now I don\u2019t believe that snakes have emotions like humans, but if they did, I would have to say she really had affection for my son. \n\nI\u2019m glad you found a solution to your problem, even though it\u2019s not what you hoped in the beginning.", "YTA for owning snakes", "> I feel like your dad would\u2019ve fought way harder for you if his ex-partner wasn\u2019t pregnant. \n\nI'm not so sure.  She was freaked out by the snakes before she was pregnant.  Why did he keep dating her?", "> Hopefully he won\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\n\nI mean, his son now lives with his ex, nine hours away from him, and has completely moved out it sounds like, and is attending a new school and everything, so it sounds like there probably won't be an opportunity to make the same mistake again.\n\nGood reminder that not everything in life comes with multiple chances.", "I can hear the arguments now. \u201cI lost my son because of you, what else do you want from me??\u201d", "Or when you sit in the fence enough you bound to get splinters in your ass.", "Oooo yeah, very good point there. If some girl I was dating loudly hated my kid\u2019s hobby, she\u2019d be gone.", "They were talking about not repeating the mistake with the new baby dad had to replace OP. But if it doesn't work out, third time's a charm I'm sure.", "I think the second time would be with the new baby, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be a totally identical mistake.", "My corn snakes have always been more feisty than any ball python I have ever handled. Multiple bites by voracious corn snake hoping to eat. Never bitten by a ball.", "Dad\u2019s probably convinced himself that he allowed OP to make the choice so *he* didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the resentment towards his girlfriend for pushing OP to that \u201cchoice\u201d was too much to overcome. Raising an infant is hard, having your first months living someone be spent caring for a newborn is a great way to ensure any resentment that exists becomes all you see when you look at them.", "I feel sad about it too, but I also question his judgement from the get-go.  \n\nHe has his son living with him who is a snake enthusiast, presumably the dad also at least tolerates snakes, and he chooses to seriously date a woman who is freaked out by his son's pets?  And then he compounds the mistake by impregnating her?  He's kind of an idiot.", "Can't choose who you love. Not to mention being afraid of snakes is a common trait, particularly among women.", "Still my favorite commercial of ever.", "He probably isn\u2019t getting 50% of a newborn and courts heavily favor the mother.", "Courts actually don\u2019t, if the custody dispute actually *gets* before a judge.  \n\nBut because there is a perception that they are unlikely to get custody many fathers chose not to push it, for good and bad reasons ranging from \u201cwhy bother?\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m not putting my kids through that for nothing.\u201d", "BALONEY hi former caseworker. When men ask they usually get what they want that is a myth created by men", ">But because there is a perception that they are unlikely to get custody many fathers chose not to push it, for good and bad reasons ranging from \u201cwhy bother?\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m not putting my kids through that for nothing.\u201d\n\nI think it's due to a hell of a lot more than just the perception they will lose. \n\nSomething probably informs that. I wonder what??", "Your dad kinda deserves the break up to be honest. He should have dumped her way before he knocked her up once he found out about her intolerance for your pets. Don\u2019t move back if he asks. Your mother went through a lot of trouble to help you move to their place, it\u2019d be rude to go back now.", "[removed]", "Neutral would mean the snakes could stay.\n\nYour dad choose his 2 year gf over you. Don't forget that, he will do it again.", "you're dad should get a vasectomy. Good luck with new place/school and your snakes.", "Since I read your original post, my oldest and I decided to get a Ball Python, so when I now read your Update i went back to check the type of snakes you have with all that knowledge that I read up in the last month.\nNow I am just trying to wrap my head around your dad worrying about the baby's safety with a BALL PYTHON (even if its an adult female) and a BABY CORN SNAKE. \n\nGlad you could go to your Mom, even if its not your first choice.", "I was waiting for the \"noodles\" comment. I go with \"hissy noodles\" mostly. FSS, snakes are such a low \"in your face\" pet because they don't tend to have free reign of the house and don't jump up on you like cats, dogs, ferrets, rats and rabbits.
