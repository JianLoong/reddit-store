It sounds like the \"help\" was well-intentioned, but he did a poor job of reading the room.

I'm thinking a better approach right from the start would be.  \"It's good of you to want to coach, but we're not here to learn today, we're just going to have some fun.  Have a good day!\"  And then if he persisted.  \"Sir, we really are just going to bowl ourselves.\"  The \"sir\" makes it pretty clear you're not buying what he's selling.

He and the other advice givers were rude for giving you unsolicited advice in the first place.\n\nIf they were going to approach at all, it should have been with the question \"do you want some advice?\". And listen when you said \"No thank you\". Not just diving straight into advice.\n\nEven if you were there to improve your skills, you did not have to accept unsolicited advice.\n\nThat was his strike 1.\n\nYou also noted that he was trying to do so by barging into your conversation. Interrupting you when you weren't even actively bowling and were sitting and chatting.\n\nWhuch is rude pretty much all the time. I seriously doubt those were the manners he was taught as a child. And another reason to not want to take his advice.\n\nSo, strike 2 for him.\n\nHe also missed on listening and accepting when you politely told him you weren't looking for advice.\n\nWas it a little indirect? Maybe, but not so much so that he couldn't have gotten the message.\n\nAnd again, even if you were there to improve your game, you were by no means obligated to accept his advice.\n\nStrike 3 for him when he did not leave and continued with being Mr. Know-It-All.\n\nBeing blunt was what it appeared was going to be needed to get him to go away.

On the other hand, he wasn't insulting you or truly harassing you . . . he just was not following social cues, and thought he was helping, so there was no ill-intent on his part.\n\nI would not label you an a-hole, but just encourage some pre-emptive \"wordsmithing\" for the next time you find yourself in this situation.  \n\nFor example, with any of those responses you gave you could have instead said, \n\n* *\"I'm here to enjoy my friend's company today and just don't have time for the tips, but thank you.\"*\n* *I appreciate your attempts at helping, but I'm really fine with how I'm playing.\"*", "I get your frustration and they didn't really read the room but you could have handled it better.

I'm American married to a Brit, so I know there are definitely differences in perception on what's rude.\n\nIf I could try to explain why (as an American woman) I don't think OP was TA here... this may not be an issue in Ireland, but here in America, there's been a longstanding cultural tradition of men - especially older men - feeling they have the right or even obligation to explain to women exactly what the women are doing incorrectly.  Although it sometimes is phrased as being helpful, the core subtext is that \"I'm a man, let me give you my expertise whether you want or need it or not.\"  It's condescending, sexist and often a lowkey way for men to get close to women they'd like to talk to.  Historically, women were taught to be polite and not harm these important men's egos.  So no matter how offensive the intrusion, no matter if you just wanted a drink with your pals, no matter if the man actually was an idiot who had no clue what he was talking about it was on you as the woman to be unfailingly polite and sweet.  Women are starting to get sick of it.  They're realizing that often these men don't have a clue what they're talking about and even if they do that it's rude of them to essentially interrupt and force themselves upon women who aren't seeking their input.  Women here are realizing that it's OK to say \"no, thank you.\" and then if the guy persists, to be more direct.  And if the guy feels hurt, that's his problem and he brought it on himself.\n\nI gave this in another response, so excuse me for repeating it but this story encapsulates the issue here.  I'm a woman and I compete in a sport that's generally 95% men.  I do very well in that sport and win a fair bit of the time.  At the end of the day, the other competitors often gather around the winners to talk.  The men always ask the winning men for tips and to discuss strategy.  Do you know what they discuss with me?  They either tell me that my equipment is really fantastic or they give me tips on what I could be doing better.  And yes, these are men I've just beaten.  Over time, as a woman you just get tired of it.  Am I rude?  No.  But I no longer stand and smilingly, politely listen either.  I shouldn't have to.", ">Telling someone's thinking isn't something they care about is? When the person thinks they are trying to help and you know this?\n\nIf you try to give someone unsolicited advice, especially after they indicate they aren't interested, then yeah, you should be able to accept that they don't care what you say. He may have initially been trying to help, but when OP said she was just there to have fun, he should have gotten the hint and left her alone. It's actually rude to insist on giving someone advice they don't want.

(\"Your help is not appreciated here.\") \n\nIs she wrong? He's persisting in telling her information she doesn't want after letting him know she wasn't interested in it. It's the same issue as above: if you can't accept that ppl might not want your help, then don't offer it more than once. Make one attempt, and if they turn you down, like OP did, then drop it. Otherwise, you're disrespecting their decision and crossing boundaries. \n\n>And then telling them get away from them (\"Please leave.\")\n\nYou do know that it's okay to tell someone to leave if they're bothering you, right?\n\n>And in a bowling alley with old people?

People believed it detached and began freely floating, causing damage. The oldest cure was marriage and impregnation to \"weigh\" the uterus down, and some physicians refused to treat women who wouldn't marry. From there it eventually evolved to believing the female body in general was simply more prone to illness and less able to handle stress, and remedies often revolved around isolation from social, intellectual, and creative life. Though some women were the unfortunate victims of more extreme \"cures,\" such as lobotomies. In short, people were describing what they believed to be a biological difference, not a social difference. \n\n\"Mansplaining\" is not trying to comment on male biology. It's trying to comment on socialization patterns. \n\nI'm not going to argue about whether the existence of words like \"mansplaining\" are helpful or harmful. However, comparing mansplaining to things like hysteria is not only inaccurate, but very minimizing to the realities of hysteria. The worst \"mansplaining\" has led to is some hurt feelings and false accusations. Hysteria led to women being institutionalized, forced into marriages, denied access to intellectual and creative spaces, and a denial of medical care for physical ailments (which were instead treated as mental illness). The results of hysteria are still seen in the medical sphere today, in various gender disparities in medical treatment. \n\nComparing a mean comment you received on the Internet to a social phenomenon that led to people's deaths is not a fair comparison.", "I thought my Attenborough impression was funny, not deep ..also I didn't downvote \ud83e\udd23 I appreciate the very very long response ..but I'm not into reading paragraphs of text, I just keep it light, cause yano ..its reddit \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "> If you try to give someone unsolicited advice, especially after they indicate they aren't interested, then yeah, you should be able to accept that they don't care what you say. \n\nYes you have the \"technical\" right but then, as I mention in my first post, you start getting into \"old grumpy man\" territory.  \n\n> I don't know why this matters.\n\nBecause of context.  its a bunch of old people trying to help a person.

Being blunt isn't the same thing as being an \"old grumpy man.\" \n\n>its a bunch of old people trying to help a person.\n\nIt doesn't matter how old they are. As soon as OP said \"thanks, but I just want to have fun,\" he should have dropped it. Continuing to push the issue makes him the asshole. Being old doesn't mean you can't be called out for being an asshole. \n\n>Yes you do have the right to tell a bunch of old people to leave you alone. It still makes you an A.\n\nYou can tell anyone to leave you alone and it doesn't make you an asshsole. Age doesn't matter. If someone is infringing on your personal space, continuing to talk to you when you told them to stop, or otherwise bothering you, telling them to leave you alone doesn't make you an asshole bc you're letting them know you don't want them to antagonize you anymore. And an old man can certainly be aware of how he's not treating someone with respect when he ignores their wishes. \n\nI don't know if your focus on age is some \"don't respect your elsers\" thing or you think old ppl are too fragile to be told something that's not overly nice or what.", "Owie, no need to get so emotional over a joke mate.\nSeriously doubting that you're 25, with these responses.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
