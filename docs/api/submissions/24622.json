I was shocked to see a loan in my name which was in debt.

I phoned all family it could be and was told it wasn\u2019t them at all, but that I was overreacting and it wasn\u2019t a big deal.

I have spoken to lawyers, advice people and other family all have said I am doing the right thing even though there is a huge risk of a close sibling being taken in by the police. I recently got a phone call from said sibling telling me I had to take the police report back as the report and investigation could end their job possibilities and therefore couldn\u2019t afford to carry on for long. They were adamant they didn\u2019t not do this act of fraud. I feel I am in the right even though I am doing this solely in my interests of not only making sure I can get a good graduate scheme but also making sure my credit is good. I have worked so hard to get where I am and I do not want to let that be ruined by fraud.
