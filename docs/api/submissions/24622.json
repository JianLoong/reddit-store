I have been through a lot in my past from serious mental health issues to health scares and have recently got to my best place in life, I have a caring gf a great degree and I am moving on to get another degree in a subject I love. \n\nI am preparing to get into graduate schemes so in an effort to prepare I checked my credit score. I was shocked to see a loan in my name which was in debt. Upon further investigation and phoning the loan organisation I found out this debt was out for debt enforcement with them seeking a reasonable amount of money in my name. I phoned all family it could be and was told it wasn\u2019t them at all, but that I was overreacting and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. (With all information I could get it all pointed to my sibling taking this loan out) To me this is huge not only am I really worried by breaking rules (neurodivergent) but I am applying for graduate schemes where they have to check my credit score and I am rated as very low meaning I would not be employable.\n\nAs a result of this I have reported this to the police even though it is likely a sibling would be investigated and possibly arrested for this. I have spoken to lawyers, advice people and other family all have said I am doing the right thing even though there is a huge risk of a close sibling being taken in by the police. I recently got a phone call from said sibling telling me I had to take the police report back as the report and investigation could end their job possibilities and therefore couldn\u2019t afford to carry on for long. They were adamant they didn\u2019t not do this act of fraud. I feel I am in the right even though I am doing this solely in my interests of not only making sure I can get a good graduate scheme but also making sure my credit is good. I have worked so hard to get where I am and I do not want to let that be ruined by fraud. Even if it does come at the risk of a close sibling. \n\nSo reddit I ask again AITA?\n\nEdit 1: This police investigation may also impact my niece as they are involved in a custody battle and this could be used against my sibling.", "created_utc": 1692002814, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qp25c/aita_for_getting_my_family_investigated_by_the/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely not.\n\nIf they didn't do it as an act of fraud the loan would be in your sibling's name, and not in your name. It was absolutely an act of fraud. They just didn't expect you to find out. Let the police complete their investigation and clear your credit record.\n\nEdit: NTA"]}
