You actually should not be driving at all, if your condition is so debilitating that you cannot even decide simple things. If this was a new development, you would already be seeking emergency medical care, not avoiding your responsibilities.\n\nWhat if you have a panic attack while driving and are a danger to yourself and others. If you say your panic is not that bad, then you are lying or over dramatizing your condition. \n\nGet therapy. Let your classmates know you have a medical condition and can't drive them. Let them know immediately since this is a time sensitive thing for them.", "Ah yes, because emergencies don't happen and you know my life... This actually did happen just now, and I'm already in therapy.

My point is you're not taking your anxiety as seriously as you should or you are over exaggerating to feel validated. \n\nEmergencies happen. If you are not well enough to drive safely and tend to your responsibilities, then the only right answer is to let the people depending on you know that you cannot fulfil your obligations. \n\nYTA for even considering to drive other people while in crisis mode.\n\nYTA for not telling those people depending on you that they need to make other plans.\n\nYTA for seeking online validation instead of seriously addressing your anxiety issues."]}
