That could be relevant too.\n\nEither way, as a married woman myself, I don't have long phone calls with other men where I'm giggling and trying to hide my phone from my husband's view.

My husband and I share our phones all the time.

Fortunately, we are both on the same page with that. \n\nOP is NTA \nYeah, it feels a little weird to have to sneak a look at her phone, but the behavior did seem to warrant it. \n\nFor reference, one of my parents cheated on the other. Fortunately they didn't transfer any disease before the cheating was discovered. \n\nLooking at a phone doesn't cause permanent health conditions.
