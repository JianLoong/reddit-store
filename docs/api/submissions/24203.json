The fact that he called you selfish for asking him to do for you what you've already done for him is a major red flag. Unfortunately, it sounds like he has no intentions of backing off of his work for his health.", "NTA 100%. Not only have you already made the exact sacrifice you\u2019re asking him to make for the family, his doctor straight up told him to do it for his own health. \n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong. He needs to get his head screwed back on straight and realize that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him when he has a whole ass family to think about.", "NTA, I honestly don't understand the other judgements here. If his doctor is suggesting he cuts back his work, her starting to work again seems like a logical suggestion. I don't read any kind of bad actions or timing on her part. They are married, making financial decisions together, this seems like a decent suggestion which they could explore. The husband might feel bad about not being as active in the company he built, but life doesn't pause for that, financial decisions need to be made.\n\nNow he gets to spend more time with his kids, just a couple years before his oldest becomes and adult, that sounds pretty good to me.", "NTA. Make sure his life insurance policy is current.", " Info: you said your first child was born 15 years ago. Are your children not school age? Can you not just go back to work anyway?\n\nETA: NTA, I would say nah except husband called you selfish for wanting to do the same thing he\u2019s doing", "NTA at all.\n\nBut having seen this situation about a dozen times at this point, make sure you actually want it before he goes through with it. The pipeline from \"stepped back from my career for my family\" and \"wife divorced me for making less money\" is an express train.", "NTA. You would be following the doctor's advice.", "I\u2019m not going to pass a judgment. But it doesn\u2019t sound like that there was any kind of an arrangement made. In other words, your husband didn\u2019t promise to switch places with you after a certain number of years had passed. \n\nYou need to consider if it makes financial sense for him to give up his well-paying job and for you to try to pick up the slack. Also, it also depends on how strong of a health concern the doctor has.", "INFO \nYour title says you told your husband it was time to sacrifice his career.\n\n\nBody of your post says \"I only suggested it because of what his doctor said.\"\n\nSo were you telling or suggesting? Were you telling/suggesting that he sacrifice his career or that he take it easier?\n\nYour inconsistency is huge here", "NTA. Let's dissect this. Your husband is a career man and he can afford that career because you're home with the child. Chances are, the high blood pressure originated/persisted because he is a type A person: driven, in need of control, etc. The doctor suggested he calms down a bit, but he can't grow out of his patterns - so he wants to keep you home and keep what he is familiar with. \n\nFirst off, you do not need his permission. Secondly, a strong man puts his woman before his need for control and micromanaging. Thirdly, a wise one would take up the challenge, do something good for his health and for his wife, and would refrain from complaining.\n\nDon't worry, you are GOOD.", "YTA. This was not the right time to bring that up at all. Your husband has just received some tough news from the doctor which will affect his career and based on what he said about his job it will affect something he clearly enjoys.\n\nIt sounds like you resent him for the fact that you sacrificed your career 15 years ago but it sounds like that was a joint decision so you are every bit as accountable for it.\n\nAnd besides, why does anyone need to sacrifice now - your kid is 15 and in school presumably so you can go back to work without forcing your husband back into the home.", "You\u2019re justified to ask hubby to take a step back so you can focus on your career.\n\nBut man, you did it so poorly here. YTA", "YTA\n\nWhat you did here, was take some very very bad news that your husband got from his doctor, and then turned it around and made it all about you and what you want.  \n\nWhile there's nothing wrong with wanting to go back to work, and having a discussion with him about that, the *way* you did it here was definitely not the best.   It *was* selfish to use his health problems as leverage.", "YTA Your kid is 15. You can go back to work and hire a carer.  You don\u2019t even need to go full time to benefit from being in the workforce. This is not an either / or situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
