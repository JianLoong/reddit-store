I just realized  they are helping themselves to pretty much anything in our fridge and sometimes leaving stuff out when they are done.\n\nI  was very bothered by this as I was raised totally differently ( I grew up poor, with sometimes not a lot to eat and he didn't) and this is highly rude to me. My husband insists I'm crazy, selfish and that  it is normal and I just need to get over it.\n\nI also want to mention my husband and I are both having completely separate  spending accounts, he buys his groceries, I buy mine. He makes 3x what I make so them eating some of my stuff has a bigger financial impact on me than  him. He offered to buy back what they had but it is more the fact they thought it would be ok that bothers me, since they know we have separate groceries.\n\n(We used to share the grocery bill but he would control what I got and if it was necessary so this was the first reason why we did that. I had enough of having to justify why I wanted to buy something, while shopping at the store. The other reason is he has a very big family, I just have my mom so I was not happy to have to contribute 50% of the bill when they visited and also them and I dont get along well)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Since it is his family, he cooks for them so they were not just left \"to starve\" but they got hungry I guess and just took whatever looked good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : It is established that guests can do whatever they want when they come here, they dont even knock which is another thing that I find a little irritating. They walked on things I would have rather kept private.\n\nBUT when we ran into this issue at first, I mentioned to him and his family that I live here too and that I am not ok with them not asking first and I was just made fun of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : We talked to his family (since my family would never do that) and they just made fun of me for being \"cheap\" and how ridiculous it was that I had a spot for my groceries. So they know, they just choose to not take my feeling into consideration.\n\nAlso my husband support them so I guess they feel \"free\" to do so as well but that's another issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : I forgot to mention I am not American and I never saw this done in my country but I cant say that it is the norm, just that I never saw it done before)\n\nEdit : When I first moved in with my husband, I was not legally allowed to work because of visa stuff BUT I had saved money because I knew about it. He knew that I might run out before I got a job. Since I couldnt contribute towards the house and bills (only groceries) I guess that could have been the reason he/they thought I wasnt allowed to voice my \"demands\" as they call them. And this just became the norm. I didnt think about this until tonight honestly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1671855162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu1e2t/aita_for_thinking_it_is_not_normal_for_family/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He grew up in a family where this was normal behavior, and he has seemingly given them permission to do so now. While I would never go rooting through someone\u2019s fridge or pantry without permission, it is common to invite house guests to help themselves, and it seems that is what\u2019s happening here.\n\nThey need to be respectful and clean up after themselves, and since you and your husband apparently don\u2019t share food, you need to have him request they stop eating your stuff, unless you are willing to accept his paying you back for whatever they use during their stay.", "Im soo confused on the buying separate groceries as a married couple? Do you also each get a shelf in your fridge that you dont share with each other?\n\nI guess you need to go and put labels on all your food that says your name and not to touch..", "It's pretty normal for family who is staying with you to eat from your fridge. I've never heard of a married couple who buy separate groceries. INFO: Why don't you just talk to them about it?", "Info - how long have you two been together that this is just showing up now? \n\nNTA Since you have a boundary and they are crossing it but it just seems so strange that this was never discussed or explained to anyone until it was an issue. Personally I don't care and want people to be comfortable in my home with anything but to each their own.", "NTA, but your husband is an AH. He knows you each buy your own food and that's its because he's controlling over what you get if he pays for it. He doesn't stop his family from eating your food, and joins his family in making fun of you. They don't knock before entering when the doors closed (who does that?!!). And they use your things and sometimes they disappear. I was raised that all of these are rude. And I'd never just take food, since unless you ask you don't know if it was going to be part of dinner or someone was taking it to work for lunch.", "NTA.  Leaving food out and making fun of your expectations is NOT okay.  Also, it is your husband\u2019s job to make sure his family is not disrupting your routine or making you uncomfortable.  He needs to do a better job at managing his family.\n\nThat said, I think it is very common to give close family or friend houseguests permission to get their own food out of the refrigerator.  IMO that is preferable to having to offer and prep each and every meal and snack for one\u2019s houseguests.  A good host will inform their guests what food is and is not available for them.  He or she will also politely define the host\u2019s expectations for cleanliness and chores.  It would be a simple matter for your husband to point out which sections of the refrigerator and pantry are off-limits, and to insist his family cleanup after themselves.", "Nta my family never comes over to each others houses and just helps themselves to anything in the fridge. They will however eat snacks we have left out for them or eat any leftovers that are offered to just help yourself without asking is so rude .\n\nEdit : Just saw they let themselves into your home without knocking??? Absolutely not ! I won\u2019t even let people in unless I know I\u2019m advance that they were coming down and yes that does include family and friends.", "If they are staying a few days, then YTA. If I have people staying, I buy extra food with the assumption they are going to eat. Are they supposed to ask you permission every time they are hungry? That's just awkward for them.", "YTA. If it were a short visit (couple of hours) it'd be weird for them to raid your fridge. If they're going to be there multiple days, you really expect them to ask for permission or go out every time they eat?", "NAH- there are 2 different norms at play here. Your husband's family & yours. \n\nI tell everyone who visits to help themselves to whatever they want, because that's how I was raised. I don't want to play host whenever my friends come over \n\nHowever, it sounds like you were raised quite differently. \n\nSo really, noone is the a*hole because it's a familial cultural clash", "NTA\n \nIt just seems plain rude.  Unless someone proactively tells you to help yourself it is NOT ok.  You voiced your concern.  They are aware of your feelings. Although their normal is different it sounds like they are deliberately mean.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA for just going by what\u2019s normal to you but your husband  has said this is normal for their family.  Normal for ours also.  Your husband also said he will replace what they are if yours so let him.  Do they understand you buy your own groceries? And he buys his? It doesn\u2019t sound like they are being very polite to you.  But they are his family so just let him replenish anything they use of yours. Make a list so you know.", "NTA\n\nMy family's kinda like that. BUT they always ask my wife about it! We'll just kimda point at the kitchen & tell em \"Root, hog or die.\" cuz I'm not cooking til supper. And leaving food out is just a waste!", "I don't get why you were made to spend 50% when HIS family was visiting?\nNext time just refuse....and make him replace all the stuff that was eaten from your stuff, since he offered.", "NTA. So you have to buy your own groceries but he supports his family financially all the time and their groceries when they visit? I really don't understand this arrangement. Even if you were just a  roommate this would be a NTA situation", "NAH. It all depends on how you grew up. My family is very much like your husband\u2019s. Everyone is expected to feel \u2018at home\u2019 at everyone\u2019s house. But I have many friends who were raised differently and expect any visitor (regardless of relationship) to wait to be offered, or ask if they need anything.", "After reading your edits and comments i go with NTA\n\nHis family is rude af and your husband sounds controlling.", "You definitely made me think about this and even when I go back to visit my parents there is at least a \"help yourself while you're here\" comment or I'll ask if anyone is saving anything for a meal / something special that I shouldn't eat.\n\nEspecially as you've stated you have mentioned it to them and they've brushed you off, NTA.\n\nThe separate groceries and food thing I did with my now husband for a while so I do get that (he was training and only ate chicken rice and vegetables and I needed variety and spice in my life) but when we got married that did shift. \n\nIt boils down to also this is your house and regardless of customs you're owed a little respect in terms of your preferences and rules, and I would hope some support from your husband over something that's clearly important to you with regards to the origins being food insecurity.\n\nEdit: added last part", "YTA. If we have guests stay with us, we always tell them to make themselves at home and help themselves to whatever we have. It\u2019s part of being a host.", "NTA I'm the same. I would never take something that isn't mine, and even further someone not my relative/close friend. I always ask. If something is my bestie's wife, I won't touch it. Out of respect.", "NTA.  To eat from your fridge?  Normal.  To do it without asking?   Not normal.", "Yes. YTA. \nBut they are wrong for not cleaning up after themselves. \n(The dynamic between you and the hubby is a bit strange\u2026 but that\u2019s your business.)", "YTA.  Do you expect your guests not to eat while they are staying with you?  Are they supposed to buy their own food?   If your husband is willing to basically pay you back for what they are eating, what\u2019s the problem?", "Your husband and his family are not taking into consideration that you have separate finances, and you make far less than him. What he should\u2019ve done is gone out and stocked the fridge and pantry with food for his family. If you\u2019re on a limited budget, and they\u2019re eating your food, that\u2019s not fair, especially if they come from a more stable financial standpoint than you do. He makes three times what you do. That\u2019s a really large financial gap between the two of you. \n\nThis feels very unfair to me, solely based on your different financial positions.\n\nNTA", "NAH. In my family, we allow our family to do the same. If they are hungry, they can eat. We don't want them asking. We want our family comfortable in our home. They usually ask anyways, but it's never expected. \n\nI think you guys just grew up differently. I don't think it's rude.", "Edit NTa \n\nInfo why do you both buy your groceries separately ? \n\nHave you spoken to them about asking ? I grew up with family just going into the fridge but I always asked at other people's homes bc I didn't want to eat something that was meant for something else.", "Yta", "No one's an asshole. You just have two different styles.  They think going into a family members fridge is natural. I wouldn't be surprised if your husband has done it in their homes. But it's not how you were raised. So find some mutual understanding.\n\nIt's like deciding whether to have Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day and declaring anyone who doesn't think like you an asshole.", "NTA - but get yourself a fridge with a lock - problem solved.", "NTA, but only because they made fun of you for it. Otherwise it would be a NA situation, just two different families with different expectations. Sort out the money side of it with your husband and get through the holidays.", "NTA - But know when to pick your battles. Take him up on his offer to replace your food.", "My extended family is definitely the \u201cwe share as much food as possible\u201d type. Anyone who comes to our house is TOLD they are welcome to anything and can help themselves and then are also offered five individual items.\n\nMost of the places I visited are the same.\n\nNot sure if it\u2019s a cultural (italian american) or regional (north east us) thing, but it will be interesting to see what other people say. \n\nThey definitely should not he leaving out trash.\n\nIt is very odd that you split grocery costs as a married couple.\n\nNAH", "Soft YTA. When I have family over, my house is their house. We share food. I\u2019d rather they help themselves than be getting them stuff all the time", "NTA\n\nmainly because they leave the food out. But when you have guests you can't expect them to not go hungry other than meal hours.", "NTA: so I get it, felt the same way when I was living with grandparents and my cousins would visit and eat my stuff, my solution(cuz I hate confrontation) was to buy a mini fridge and keep all food I bought for myself in my room, just an option to think about.", "NTA- but I don\u2019t think they are either. Now that you  and your husband are aware of this difference in social norms, you can adjust. Maybe he needs to by more snacks or food before they come that is available for them. Or he can buy the groceries the week before. Or get a mini fridge for you in another room when there is company. Find a solution that will solve the problem as a team.", "Soft YTA", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if there is a norm here. I\u2019ve stayed at friends and family\u2019s homes that are very much \u201chelp yourself\u201d attitude but I\u2019ve also stayed places where I definitely wouldn\u2019t do that. \n\nBut since they\u2019re taking things out and leaving it, they don\u2019t clean up after themselves and you talked about it and they were rude in response, definitely NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s incredibly rude to do", "NTA \n\nbecause everyone has a right to set their own rules in their own home, but if it were me, I'd be happy to see that because it means they feel at home.\n\nI get bothered when it goes the other way, meaning everything is formal, reserved, and polite.  I get enough of that shit in public.  I'd rather relax at home and see everyone else relax too.\n\nBut if you were raised that way then there is no shame in thinking it's wrong.

Like there is a middle ground and he doesn't seem to be finding it. \n\nIt just seems you're very self aware and have done a lot of work and he isn't meeting you half way. Your food trauma may never go away, but it takes nothing away from him to help you hold this boundary with his family / to insist they don't call you 'cheap', and to be sensitive to it.\n\nFor what it's worth I don't think you're being cheap, and I hope you aren't being too hard on yourself.", "OP didn\u2019t mention if the husband did or not. If he thinks it\u2019s normal, he might\u2019ve said \u201chelp yourself\u201d.", "No, for judging the guests based on that bc they were told something else. Read the other comments", "But your husband said he would pay for it so it really is a non issue, and it\u2019s pretty normal for family to help themselves. YTA sorry", "Ok NTA it's def not okay for them to make fun of you for this. You grew up one way and he did another compromise is that there can be things they can have and those they can't. \nBut he needs to stand up for you. This should not be a haha moment at you but an oh I didn't realize I'm sorry", "Do you guys not eat meals together? Do you each just make completely separate dishes when you do?\n\nAlso, while your in laws are being rude by making fun of you and not cleaning up after themselves, it is very poor hosting to expect house guests not to be able to make food or beverages while they are there.", "Maybe that\u2018s not the right family for you\u2026", "Personally this is what I do, or I go out if I am hungry and they don't have something planned. Even at my parents, I usually ask if I can have something.", "I do or I ask. I never simply go and help myself.", "Omg!! Leaving food out is so wasteful! And leaving water running?!? Do NOT get me started!!! Water is one of our most precious commodities. To do that in your own home is one thing, but to do it in someone else\u2019s is ridiculous. Water and food are expensive!", "Your house should be your safe space. These people are so rude and mock you in your own home - and with your husbands blessing it seems! \n\nIt is so rude to go and help yourself to someone's fridge and especially so after you told them you weren't comfortable with it. They don't respect you at all. No one would be allowed in my home if they didn't respect me regardless if they were my husbands family or not.", "The \"funny\" part, because talking about it brought back some stuff, I remember and that was couple years ago now, when I had just moved in. We had the argument about his family helping themselves to my stuff and he said well its how things are here, get over it. So when his sister came and brought pizza, I had some too since we were all supposed to share from what my husband said. She made some comments about how \"it was hers and she didnt have enough for me\", my husband said she was just messing with me.  I think it was this happening that  just made me even more defensive on the subject. Because what they do to me, they dont like it done to them.", "He is American and I am from Europe. \n\nHe definitely want that, the 2 reasons I dont want to sacrifice is he makes more than me, I am very careful about what I get, look for discount, try not to waste food and he is the opposite. The second is we have very different tastes so when his family eat my stuff, I dont necessary want his stuff (if that makes sense?)", "We used to, but since I moved in with him, I pretty much moved in with his family. Its more a me, him and them relationship than just him and I so this has been creating a lot of tensions.\n\nThey have no issues texting him about our couple and what he should do. I saw pretty mean texts about me and when I told him he said \"they just trying to protect me\"", "sure, so when they are invited I dont mind because I am aware that they will come but they often \"drop by\" and just come in. One time his dad came in while I was working out in a bra so I didnt even hear him coming in so that was pretty uncomfortable. I mentioned that to my husband and the answer was the same then for most of the issue we having, \"its what they were used to do all their lifes, you cant expect them to change for you\". I dont' mind it as much but I still get freaking out, thinking someone is breaking in", "I just added this to my post because I just realized it, I am not from this country and in my country I don't think I ever saw someone do that (going thru someone's fridge or pantry).", "yeah, I mostly wanted to see if I was in the wrong and not realizing", "well Im trying to see his side of it too, to him his family is everything and as they stir sh\\*t and our couple is getting worst, he likes them even more. \n\nHe told me that if i didnt like them, there would be no marriage but I liked them at first, when I didnt have to deal with them stepping over my boundaries all the time lmao. \n\nThe first thing that really was bad was covid, they were anti maskers and refused to wear masks around me (I am not immuno-compromised but I have weak health so that was super insulting to me), from there things only got worst. And even if he disagrees with them, he didnt like me voicing the fact I was upset (if that makes sense)", "What I meant by its not good enough is when people use something that I got but that its something that I have plenty like eggs, oil, ect, I dont mind anymore. But when they get something I had made, saved for later and its gone, I still lose my temper and he just make fun of it. They and he dont seems to get that, to them everything is replaceable which is definitely not the way I see things. Sure some things are but there is also the trouble of realizing its gone and having your plans messed up", "Then you should ask if that was the case, not immediately give judgment without knowing. A LOT of people don't give free access to their pantries and whatnot for a lot of reasons.", "He didnt say anything because it is established that guests can do whatever they want when they come here, they dont even knock which is another thing that I find a little irritating. They walked on things I would have rather kept private. \n\nThat being said, I mentioned to him and his family that I live here too and that I am not ok with them not asking first.", "no worries! I was mostly curious, I feel it could be a cultural thing. One time they lost my hair dryer while visiting (no idea how they managed to do that) and he said \"I'll just get you a new one\". His whole family is pretty wealthy, but I was raised to be careful of people's belonging and not assume I could use it.", "no worries at all!", "While it is rude of them to laugh about it, it\u2019s very shitty hosting to expect your guests not to be able to help themselves while there. In turn they need to be respectful and clean up after themselves.", "Yes we have separate meals, when his family comes he buys food and get stuff for them, cook for them with his groceries. We started doing that because his family is huge and mine is literally just my mom right now and I didn't think it was fair to me.", "you are probably right. Things were a lot easier before I moved in with him and  I had to deal with his family. They brought a lot of tension and stress because its not just him and I discussing our disagreements, its him, I and them. They will literally text him to know about our couple and give him advices (and I dont need to ask about this, I know its wrong. I told him that its ok for them to give him advices when he asks, but they shouldnt insert themselves in our private life. He said \"they just love me\"...)\n\nMost of the tension we have been having are coming from them as well, it has been pretty frustrating. He clearly slowly picks them over me and its been hard on me as well.", "Forget my family they\u2019re a given, even my friends are allowed to get shit from my kitchen. They\u2019re guests in my home. I want them to feel comfortable. This is how it is w everyone I know", "Same", "Do you usually need to ask? One of the first things I say to a person is \u201chelp yourself to anything you want\u201d. I guess that\u2019s why you don\u2019t need to ask in my house", "leaving water running is driving me insane too haha and I never seen that before, they will wash dishes with the water running behind even though they dont use it???? or the worst (and almost comical at this point), I saw my mother in law rinse cans to put in recycle, she left the water running, while she took the cans to the bin outside and then she would complain about how high her bills are lmao, when I told her about this, she was just like \"its nothing, its not the reason my bill is high\"", "Then that is a conversation that you need to have with your husband, and point out the double standard. He also has a responsibility to call them out on their bullshit. His family will not properly respect you, if HE doesn't.", "Seems like you and your husband need to talk about how you allocate your finances so you\u2019re not so strained. If he\u2019s making 3x the amount you\u2019re making , there should be some income ratio on the housing expenses. I understand you grew up poor and that comes with trauma but it\u2019s petty getting upset of guests of your home helping themselves to the food on your fridge. NAH", "They\u2019re trying to \u201cput you in your place.\u201d And your husband seems to think it\u2019s a great idea. Time for some Big Talks with him.", "So, you definitely have a husband problem. He\u2019s controlling, dismissive of your feelings, and allowing his family to violate your boundaries. This is far beyond people eating your food. I don\u2019t like to be one of those people who screams file for divorce, but based on all the new info you\u2019ve added between the edits and now (and assuming you are being honest), you really need to cast a critical eye at your relationship, because it\u2019s concerning in several ways.", "Husband is wrong!  Yes - yes you CAN (and should!) expect them to change for you because this is YOUR home too!", "Yeah I get what you mean.  I\u2019ll admit my adult child is living with us right now and I\u2019m kind of possessive about my things so I know how you feel.", "That's very empathetic of you to try and see his side and if this was just about guests helping themselves to food vs. asking first I would say N. A. H. However,  it sounds like your husband and family's actions in your home are disrespectful and you do deserve better treatment! \n\nIt seems like what is your husband's is his and what is yours is also his and his family's.", "OP doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally dictate that though. OP and her husband need to have a frank discussion about hosting people in the future since their arrangement around food is very unconventional. If you\u2019re going to compartmentalize a part of your life like roommates, you gotta have a discussion about whose guests can do what.", "Okay, OP, can you clarify? Did your husband tell them that they could help themselves? Or did he tell them to bring their own snacks?", "Well, if that has been established, then you can\u2019t really blame them. I get that it\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s between you and your husband and they really aren\u2019t to blame. Y\u2019all need to get on the same page. They should definitely clean up after themselves. Maybe you should start telling your husband to buy groceries before they come to visit and maybe lock your door so they can\u2019t walk in", "Yeah. The fact they make fun of you for having boundaries in your home, and they borrow then \u2018lose\u2019 items of yours (they didn\u2019t lose it, someone liked it and took it) is really disrespectful. And the fact that your husband earns more than 3x what you do, but you had to resort to buying separate groceries because he tried to control what you bought is even more worrying. These people don\u2019t respect you. Replacing something AFTER they\u2019ve helped themselves is not the same thing as showing you the respect you deserve in the first place. I think you need to start casting a more critical eye over the way your husband and his family treat you, and why you\u2019ve tolerated it  for so long.", "So you and your spouse do not ever eat the same meal at home, even when guests aren\u2019t there?", "This will only get worse - he has his priorities and you doesn\u2019t seem to be one of them.", "It\u2019s rude not to ask. It\u2019s basic etiquette", "Its why I wanted to stay vague at first because I am aware of it and I wanted to get people's opinion without all the extra \"drama\".", "Which is part of my point. Not everyone has the same standards regarding this stuff.", "Agreed, but that is between them. Blaming guests for their miscommunication isn\u2019t really fair to them and will probably lead to strained relationships.", "sorry for the late reply! this issue happened before with his sister just coming over for few hours, so I told him what I wanted and why, he told his sister and they just made fun of me. Then pretty much everyone in his family was told about how \"weird\" I was. So they know but choose to not care and when I say something, I just get made fun of.", "It is rare we do, its pretty much up to him and I to decide how we feel about it. We have very different tastes so that contributes to it as well.", "Im still hoping things will get back to how they were. I am slowly saving up for a house so I am hoping that once we move to a house that is \"mine\", I would have more of a voice. Right now its his place and even if I contribute to it,  I dont think his family ever really realized that it was somewhat my place too. Or they just dont care, I kinda gave up trying with them after they were pretty rude a few times.", "I\u2019ll repeat myself I guess, there\u2019s no need to ask in my home bc I have already given people permission when they walk in my home. That is what I have learned is the polite thing to do", "But the extra 'drama' is important because your husband is the problem. The controlling behavior, dismissiveness, his family, the finances...you have a husband problem and a marriage problem.\n\nTo be clear NTA but you REALLY need to be reevaluating a way out of this entire situation as it's clearly not a healthy marriage for you.", "OP already said elsewhere now that the husband told his family it was fine to help themselves. Given that OP replied to me directly that she and the husband don\u2019t even eat the same meal together even when guests aren\u2019t there, this is a much bigger issue than just the guest thing. Having separate finances is perfectly fine, but if a couple is drawing such stringent lines in the sand that they can\u2019t even make the same meal, I think that\u2019s a bit odd.", "Never said OP should blame the guests. I told her directly she had a husband problem, not an in law problem. Also OP just sounds like a bad host. It\u2019s normal to tell people to help themselves if they are staying in your home. In turn, they need to be respectful and clean up after themselves, but OP\u2019s husband needs to broach that topic with them.", "So that part is definitely rude on their part. They shouldn\u2019t laugh. Is your husband also comfortable with your food splitting agreement, because that would make him \u201cweird\u201d as well in their eyes. I really think this is a conversation that needs to be had with your husband rather than your guests. If he offers to pay, just buy extra of everything and charge him for that.", "Do you do anything together that requires finances? Like do you take separate trips and transportation or is it just food related?", "Don\u2018t underestimate the dynamics - it is you vs them. There is an argument? He gets coached from the family and you are made fun of. You aren\u2018t a person to them. Your boundaries don\u2018t count to them. Save the money, get your house and leave him in his place. Maybe you work better than a couple with separate places - maybe you realise that you are emotionally better of without him and his family.", "maybe it is a cultural thing then, I was mostly curious to see and it looks like its 50-50", "And I learned it was polite to ask before eating whatever is there since it could be for dinner, or someone's lunch. But I come from a family that grew up in the depression so no one kept a lot of extra food. They all had menus and budgets they followed to make sure everyone could be fed the most cost efficient way possible.", "I understand, I mostly wanted to see if I was crazy, because they make me feel like it sometimes. They do a lot of things that are disrespectful and my husband keeps telling me its not. I know some things are wrong in our marriage but Im also trying to see his side of the story. Before I made the edits, it was a 50/50 so that makes me feel a little better, knowing that some people here think like me because he often says that I refuse to adjust to the culture.", "Then there are far deeper issues here, especially if she KNEW he gave permission, not just wasn't sure of it or not.", "You didn\u2019t say that, but I was saying (or what I meant) was OP seems like they are getting upset at the guests when the guests have a different view of what they\u2019re allowed to do.", "Yeah they think he is weird for doing that but they are happy that he isnt \"paying for my stuff\" which is insane to me since he is making a lot more than me and I dont have expensive tastes so its not like Im trying to take advantage of him. \n\nI would totally do that, buy extra and charge him, the issue is (not all but some of his family) is spoiled and if they dont want to eat something, they will just eat something else. I guess the issue is a lot more complicated than I realized. By example tonight he had gotten them some alcohol but they saw mine and they took mine because they wanted this and not the stuff he got.", "yes it is the plan that we both agreed on, it just takes a lot of time because I dont make that much and the market is crazy! I think I might just rent something but it really hurts to pay more towards rent than I would towards a mortgage", "It's more than cultural. It's also whether your family had money or not growing up, family customs, etc. My family grew up in the depression in the late 1920s and 1930s when sometimes all they had was a little bread and butter for the kids and the parents didn't eat.  All of my family had menus and budgets to make sure they could feed everyone as cost efficiently as possible. My mom never paid full price for meats, and bought a much as possible on sale or with coupons to save money, even after she worked and could afford more. Even when I visited my parents, I never just took food from their refrigerator because my mom often used leftovers to make the next dinner.", "just to clarify, the permission was always \"given\" BUT I told him what I would like that to change because it made me uncomfortable, and he and his family made fun of it. I explained to them why it was important to me and they just choose to ignore it.", "So every few days tally what they ate of yours and have your husband give you that amount of money?  While this practice is baffling to me, it seems like a relatively simple one to solve. He\u2019s offered to replace the item/repay you for what they eat. Say \u201cok\u201d and move along. After they leave have a talk with him about your expectations going forward. Your home and, ultimately, your rules. Your husband should help you find a resolution and talk to his family about it.\n\nIf this is a dealbreaker for you perhaps consider a second fridge in the garage (if you have one) so that when his family comes over they don\u2019t have access to your food at all.\n\nThis is not an issue I\u2019ve ever heard\u2026like ever, so I\u2019m trying to not ESH this based on my cultural roadblocks but I don\u2019t see how to avoid it. They\u2019re definitely TA for making fun of you. Your husband is also TA for not supporting you. You\u2019re TA for not agreeing that your husband should simply cover what they eat and thereby you\u2019re refusing to help solve the problem, which creates ongoing conflict during their visit. Fight the battle after they leave, for now call a truce if for no other reason than to reduce your own stress.", "I totally agree, when you look at the issue rationally this is a perfectly fine solution and most of the time I am ok with it. But its the lack of respect from them towards me that just makes that some times, I lose my temper. Because to me, imo, they are doing lots of things that are not respectful and depending on how my day went, I sometimes lose it."]}
