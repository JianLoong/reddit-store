I just realized  they are helping themselves to pretty much anything in our fridge and sometimes leaving stuff out when they are done.\n\nI  was very bothered by this as I was raised totally differently ( I grew up poor, with sometimes not a lot to eat and he didn't) and this is highly rude to me. My husband insists I'm crazy, selfish and that  it is normal and I just need to get over it.\n\nI also want to mention my husband and I are both having completely separate  spending accounts, he buys his groceries, I buy mine. He makes 3x what I make so them eating some of my stuff has a bigger financial impact on me than  him. He offered to buy back what they had but it is more the fact they thought it would be ok that bothers me, since they know we have separate groceries.\n\n(We used to share the grocery bill but he would control what I got and if it was necessary so this was the first reason why we did that. I had enough of having to justify why I wanted to buy something, while shopping at the store. The other reason is he has a very big family, I just have my mom so I was not happy to have to contribute 50% of the bill when they visited and also them and I dont get along well)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Since it is his family, he cooks for them so they were not just left \"to starve\" but they got hungry I guess and just took whatever looked good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : It is established that guests can do whatever they want when they come here, they dont even knock which is another thing that I find a little irritating. They walked on things I would have rather kept private.\n\nBUT when we ran into this issue at first, I mentioned to him and his family that I live here too and that I am not ok with them not asking first and I was just made fun of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : We talked to his family (since my family would never do that) and they just made fun of me for being \"cheap\" and how ridiculous it was that I had a spot for my groceries. So they know, they just choose to not take my feeling into consideration.\n\nAlso my husband support them so I guess they feel \"free\" to do so as well but that's another issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : I forgot to mention I am not American and I never saw this done in my country but I cant say that it is the norm, just that I never saw it done before)\n\nEdit : When I first moved in with my husband, I was not legally allowed to work because of visa stuff BUT I had saved money because I knew about it. He knew that I might run out before I got a job. Since I couldnt contribute towards the house and bills (only groceries) I guess that could have been the reason he/they thought I wasnt allowed to voice my \"demands\" as they call them. And this just became the norm. I didnt think about this until tonight honestly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1671855162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu1e2t/aita_for_thinking_it_is_not_normal_for_family/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He grew up in a family where this was normal behavior, and he has seemingly given them permission to do so now. While I would never go rooting through someone\u2019s fridge or pantry without permission, it is common to invite house guests to help themselves, and it seems that is what\u2019s happening here.\n\nThey need to be respectful and clean up after themselves, and since you and your husband apparently don\u2019t share food, you need to have him request they stop eating your stuff, unless you are willing to accept his paying you back for whatever they use during their stay.", "Im soo confused on the buying separate groceries as a married couple? Do you also each get a shelf in your fridge that you dont share with each other?\n\nI guess you need to go and put labels on all your food that says your name and not to touch..", "It's pretty normal for family who is staying with you to eat from your fridge. I've never heard of a married couple who buy separate groceries. I N F O: Why don't you just talk to them about it?\n\nEdit: I think I've settled in ESH. Your family is belittling you, your husband is potentially controlling, but you are being rude, unaccommodating, and dramatic.\n\n\"He offered to buy back what they had but it is more the fact they thought it would be ok that bothers me\"", "Info - how long have you two been together that this is just showing up now? \n\nNTA Since you have a boundary and they are crossing it but it just seems so strange that this was never discussed or explained to anyone until it was an issue. Personally I don't care and want people to be comfortable in my home with anything but to each their own.", "NTA, but your husband is an AH. He knows you each buy your own food and that's its because he's controlling over what you get if he pays for it. He doesn't stop his family from eating your food, and joins his family in making fun of you. They don't knock before entering when the doors closed (who does that?!!). And they use your things and sometimes they disappear. I was raised that all of these are rude. And I'd never just take food, since unless you ask you don't know if it was going to be part of dinner or someone was taking it to work for lunch.", "NTA.  Leaving food out and making fun of your expectations is NOT okay.  Also, it is your husband\u2019s job to make sure his family is not disrupting your routine or making you uncomfortable.  He needs to do a better job at managing his family.\n\nThat said, I think it is very common to give close family or friend houseguests permission to get their own food out of the refrigerator.  IMO that is preferable to having to offer and prep each and every meal and snack for one\u2019s houseguests.  A good host will inform their guests what food is and is not available for them.  He or she will also politely define the host\u2019s expectations for cleanliness and chores.  It would be a simple matter for your husband to point out which sections of the refrigerator and pantry are off-limits, and to insist his family cleanup after themselves.", "Nta my family never comes over to each others houses and just helps themselves to anything in the fridge. They will however eat snacks we have left out for them or eat any leftovers that are offered to just help yourself without asking is so rude .\n\nEdit : Just saw they let themselves into your home without knocking??? Absolutely not ! I won\u2019t even let people in unless I know I\u2019m advance that they were coming down and yes that does include family and friends.", "If they are staying a few days, then YTA. If I have people staying, I buy extra food with the assumption they are going to eat. Are they supposed to ask you permission every time they are hungry? That's just awkward for them.", "YTA. If it were a short visit (couple of hours) it'd be weird for them to raid your fridge. If they're going to be there multiple days, you really expect them to ask for permission or go out every time they eat?", "NAH- there are 2 different norms at play here. Your husband's family & yours. \n\nI tell everyone who visits to help themselves to whatever they want, because that's how I was raised. I don't want to play host whenever my friends come over \n\nHowever, it sounds like you were raised quite differently. \n\nSo really, noone is the a*hole because it's a familial cultural clash", "NTA\n \nIt just seems plain rude.  Unless someone proactively tells you to help yourself it is NOT ok.  You voiced your concern.  They are aware of your feelings. Although their normal is different it sounds like they are deliberately mean.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA for just going by what\u2019s normal to you but your husband  has said this is normal for their family.  Normal for ours also.  Your husband also said he will replace what they are if yours so let him.  Do they understand you buy your own groceries? And he buys his? It doesn\u2019t sound like they are being very polite to you.  But they are his family so just let him replenish anything they use of yours. Make a list so you know.", "NTA\n\nMy family's kinda like that. BUT they always ask my wife about it! We'll just kimda point at the kitchen & tell em \"Root, hog or die.\" cuz I'm not cooking til supper. And leaving food out is just a waste!", "I don't get why you were made to spend 50% when HIS family was visiting?\nNext time just refuse....and make him replace all the stuff that was eaten from your stuff, since he offered.", "NTA. So you have to buy your own groceries but he supports his family financially all the time and their groceries when they visit? I really don't understand this arrangement. Even if you were just a  roommate this would be a NTA situation", "NAH. It all depends on how you grew up. My family is very much like your husband\u2019s. Everyone is expected to feel \u2018at home\u2019 at everyone\u2019s house. But I have many friends who were raised differently and expect any visitor (regardless of relationship) to wait to be offered, or ask if they need anything.", "After reading your edits and comments i go with NTA\n\nHis family is rude af and your husband sounds controlling.", "You definitely made me think about this and even when I go back to visit my parents there is at least a \"help yourself while you're here\" comment or I'll ask if anyone is saving anything for a meal / something special that I shouldn't eat.\n\nEspecially as you've stated you have mentioned it to them and they've brushed you off, NTA.\n\nThe separate groceries and food thing I did with my now husband for a while so I do get that (he was training and only ate chicken rice and vegetables and I needed variety and spice in my life) but when we got married that did shift. \n\nIt boils down to also this is your house and regardless of customs you're owed a little respect in terms of your preferences and rules, and I would hope some support from your husband over something that's clearly important to you with regards to the origins being food insecurity.\n\nEdit: added last part", "YTA. If we have guests stay with us, we always tell them to make themselves at home and help themselves to whatever we have. It\u2019s part of being a host.", "NTA I'm the same. I would never take something that isn't mine, and even further someone not my relative/close friend. I always ask. If something is my bestie's wife, I won't touch it. Out of respect.", "NTA.  To eat from your fridge?  Normal.  To do it without asking?   Not normal.", "Yes. YTA. \nBut they are wrong for not cleaning up after themselves. \n(The dynamic between you and the hubby is a bit strange\u2026 but that\u2019s your business.)", "YTA.  Do you expect your guests not to eat while they are staying with you?  Are they supposed to buy their own food?   If your husband is willing to basically pay you back for what they are eating, what\u2019s the problem?", "Your husband and his family are not taking into consideration that you have separate finances, and you make far less than him. What he should\u2019ve done is gone out and stocked the fridge and pantry with food for his family. If you\u2019re on a limited budget, and they\u2019re eating your food, that\u2019s not fair, especially if they come from a more stable financial standpoint than you do. He makes three times what you do. That\u2019s a really large financial gap between the two of you. \n\nThis feels very unfair to me, solely based on your different financial positions.\n\nNTA", "NAH. In my family, we allow our family to do the same. If they are hungry, they can eat. We don't want them asking. We want our family comfortable in our home. They usually ask anyways, but it's never expected. \n\nI think you guys just grew up differently. I don't think it's rude.", "Edit NTa \n\nInfo why do you both buy your groceries separately ? \n\nHave you spoken to them about asking ? I grew up with family just going into the fridge but I always asked at other people's homes bc I didn't want to eat something that was meant for something else.", "Yta", "No one's an asshole. You just have two different styles.  They think going into a family members fridge is natural. I wouldn't be surprised if your husband has done it in their homes. But it's not how you were raised. So find some mutual understanding.\n\nIt's like deciding whether to have Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day and declaring anyone who doesn't think like you an asshole.", "NTA - but get yourself a fridge with a lock - problem solved.", "NTA, but only because they made fun of you for it. Otherwise it would be a NA situation, just two different families with different expectations. Sort out the money side of it with your husband and get through the holidays.", "NTA - But know when to pick your battles. Take him up on his offer to replace your food.", "My extended family is definitely the \u201cwe share as much food as possible\u201d type. Anyone who comes to our house is TOLD they are welcome to anything and can help themselves and then are also offered five individual items.\n\nMost of the places I visited are the same.\n\nNot sure if it\u2019s a cultural (italian american) or regional (north east us) thing, but it will be interesting to see what other people say. \n\nThey definitely should not he leaving out trash.\n\nIt is very odd that you split grocery costs as a married couple.\n\nNAH", "Soft YTA. When I have family over, my house is their house. We share food. I\u2019d rather they help themselves than be getting them stuff all the time", "NTA\n\nmainly because they leave the food out. But when you have guests you can't expect them to not go hungry other than meal hours.", "NTA: so I get it, felt the same way when I was living with grandparents and my cousins would visit and eat my stuff, my solution(cuz I hate confrontation) was to buy a mini fridge and keep all food I bought for myself in my room, just an option to think about.", "NTA- but I don\u2019t think they are either. Now that you  and your husband are aware of this difference in social norms, you can adjust. Maybe he needs to by more snacks or food before they come that is available for them. Or he can buy the groceries the week before. Or get a mini fridge for you in another room when there is company. Find a solution that will solve the problem as a team.", "Soft YTA", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if there is a norm here. I\u2019ve stayed at friends and family\u2019s homes that are very much \u201chelp yourself\u201d attitude but I\u2019ve also stayed places where I definitely wouldn\u2019t do that. \n\nBut since they\u2019re taking things out and leaving it, they don\u2019t clean up after themselves and you talked about it and they were rude in response, definitely NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s incredibly rude to do", "NTA \n\nbecause everyone has a right to set their own rules in their own home, but if it were me, I'd be happy to see that because it means they feel at home.\n\nI get bothered when it goes the other way, meaning everything is formal, reserved, and polite.  I get enough of that shit in public.  I'd rather relax at home and see everyone else relax too.\n\nBut if you were raised that way then there is no shame in thinking it's wrong.

As a guest in someone's home, I never assume things are just up for grabs.

The fact they make fun of you for having boundaries in your home, and they borrow then \u2018lose\u2019 items of yours (they didn\u2019t lose it, someone liked it and took it) is really disrespectful.

All of my family had menus and budgets to make sure they could feed everyone as cost efficiently as possible. My mom never paid full price for meats, and bought a much as possible on sale or with coupons to save money, even after she worked and could afford more. Even when I visited my parents, I never just took food from their refrigerator because my mom often used leftovers to make the next dinner.", "just to clarify, the permission was always \"given\" BUT I told him what I would like that to change because it made me uncomfortable, and he and his family made fun of it. I explained to them why it was important to me and they just choose to ignore it.", "So every few days tally what they ate of yours and have your husband give you that amount of money?  While this practice is baffling to me, it seems like a relatively simple one to solve. He\u2019s offered to replace the item/repay you for what they eat. Say \u201cok\u201d and move along. After they leave have a talk with him about your expectations going forward. Your home and, ultimately, your rules.

You\u2019re TA for not agreeing that your husband should simply cover what they eat and thereby you\u2019re refusing to help solve the problem, which creates ongoing conflict during their visit. Fight the battle after they leave, for now call a truce if for no other reason than to reduce your own stress.", "I totally agree, when you look at the issue rationally this is a perfectly fine solution and most of the time I am ok with it.

Your husband \"allows\" or \"doesn't allow\" you things like the food you choose to buy? And you're married but have separate grocery budgets because he doesn't want to provide you food? I mean, that's a new fun level of wacky. \nNTA, for the voting, he and his family should be more polite, treat you like family and not a roommate, and respect your boundaries in your own home. \n\nBut honestly, you have accepted this as the status quo, so it's a little on you, too. Gotta wonder what this guy and his family offer that made you marry into it in the first place.", "I understand where you are coming from but the solution here unfortunately would be to keep your items separate or not to have items in the fridge when you know his family is coming. Despite cultural norms in America, it is a norm within his family to help themselves and share and I found myself more comfortable just removing my things so I didn\u2019t feel upset when someone took from my items. It is not meant to be rude and although their reactions to your sensitivity feel rude, it\u2019s probably just shocking to them that you feel this way. Your feelings are not wrong but his family is also acting appropriately.", "I am like this with my roommates good lord", "If OP is of a different race or religious background, OP's asshole husband likely calls OP \"one of the good ones\".  One of my hobbies gets tons of old white racists who marry someone from overseas who act like this. What a baby. My groceries! Mine! Mine! Mine!", ">It's pretty normal for family who is staying with you to eat from your fridge.\n\nAfter asking, not just deciding to make themselves a Porkchop while they're here.", "My boyfriend and I do this, we're going on 8 years. We eat different things so we buy our own food. If we go shopping together one of us will usually just pay but for the most part we get our own stuff. Not that weird.", "My husband and I each buy our own groceries and we've been together 31 years.  We share common non-perishable things like napkins, paper towels, plastic wrap, etc. But what we eat, we each buy for ourselves.\n\nI found there was less conflict with the food this way and each taking care of our own works best for us.", "I live in the US and the inlaws' behavior would be completely unthinkable to me. I've never heard of or seen a guest just help themselves to food without asking. NTA.", "Oh thank goodness, I was really weirded out by all the YTAs but I'm also from the UK so maybe it's just cultural. I can't imagine being that rude in someone else's house. I even ask in my own house just to check food wasn't earmarked for a particular meal!", "OP's husband makes her pay for her own groceries. He has no right to give his family (who visit often) permission to eat food that she paid for, not him, especially when they show up unexpectedly.\n\nPart of being a guest is to not show up unannounced and to not overstay your welcome. The family is falling far short on both of those.", "I'm from the US and the idea of raiding the fridge baffles me. What if I accidentally ate an ingredient for dinner?", "Not in the US either, you at least give a heads up, you might be eating the last of something.", "Im American and I find it rude.  If I stay with someone I supply food for me and mine.  Unless a meal is offered I would not rummage thru someone\u2019s fridge!\n\nI do not like it when people do that at my house either. I find it rude when hosting (and we provide enough food and drinks) but find people getting other food out of the fridge thats not meant for the event.  This could be because coming up poor and having to work hard for what we have now.", "I\u2019m from the US and my husband is a Brit. In all circumstances (us visiting friends and family or all of them visiting us for any length of time) the custom has been buy lots of extra groceries and snacks and say please help yourself to anything you want and let us know if there is anything specific we can get for you while you\u2019re staying.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t just go into someone\u2019s kitchen without being granted permission, but I would find it really odd (and probably stay elsewhere) if they didn\u2019t tell me to help myself.\n\nThe tradition is to then take the hosts out for a nice dinner or give a nice gift as a thank you for the hospitality.", "It really depends on who the guest is, for me. If it\u2019s someone I\u2019m close with, I\u2019d still appreciate if they asked but ultimately I probably wouldn\u2019t care. If there\u2019s anything specific that I\u2019m keeping for someone or that they shouldn\u2019t eat for some other reason, I\u2019ll mention it, otherwise they can just grab whatever if they\u2019re hungry. If it\u2019s not someone I\u2019m close to though then I\u2019d definitely not be cool with them going through my kitchen like that and helping themselves to whatever they wanted.", "Yeah it honestly depends on the people... when I was a kid I asked my friends family for a drink and when I opened the fridge to look with them and see what they had my friends dad got angry at me lol. Some people are just particular about certain things I guess.", "It\u2019s not that you shouldn\u2019t ask in the US, it\u2019s more that it\u2019s very normal and almost expected for the host to give you blanket permission so you don\u2019t have to ask, if you\u2019re staying several days. \u2018What\u2019s mine is yours\u2019 mentality.", "It is in many households! I would never expect to go get something out of someone\u2019s fridge without asking! I\u2019m American btw.", "> I would only get something if they told me to or if my cousins were getting something.\n\nSame! Even on sleepovers with cousins as kids, I'd wait until they'd be eating because it felt rude to just take food that wasn't mine? Never thought about it being a Brit (Welsh here) thing.", "He should be focused on helping you feel loved and safe in your own home. He's not. He puts his relatives first. He he lets them say mean things about you. He makes fun of you.\n\nThat is not a loving way for a husband to behave. He is TA.", "> His whole family is pretty wealthy,\n\nand now their attitude makes sense. They don't respect you at all, and most likely think you're beneath them.", "Honey you need to get out of this relationship. You are not being respected or treated well by your husband. I\u2019m worried his behavior is red flags for future abuse. You need to get away from him and his terrible family as soon as possible.", "I'm sorry but they're not all magically going to be nicer and treat you with respect because you live in a different house. Think about how they all treat you now. Do you want to live like that for another 40 years? I think the answer is no. The fact that your husband let's his family make fun of you in your own house is a huge red flag \n\nNTA", "I agree. I\u2019d say cut your losses and move out. Divorce is on the table if he refuses to respect you or put you first. Don\u2019t live like that.", "If your husband and his family are making you question your judgment, that is a warning sign of an abusive relationship.\n\nOnce your husband is sure that he can get away with mistreating you, expect it to get worse."]}
