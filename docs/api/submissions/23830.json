NTA, with how graphic his jokes were, he was to be taken seriously. You owe nothing to this person who clearly violated your trust and sexually harassed you.", "NTA.  He was a sex pst to you, and regularly sexually harassed you.  I\u2019m appalled that no one ever did anything about it, especially when you were on the younger side and probably not used to defending yourself against foulness like that.  His behavior was abusive, and you don\u2019t owe an abuser anything unless they\u2019ve got a legal right to it (like payment on a debt).", "NTA. I can only imagine what you mean by the \u201cworse stuff he did to others\u201d. There just is no excuse for a relative (or anyone, obviously) to make such uncomfortable sexual jokes to anyone, especially an uncle to his niece, over the span of 8 years?! Even if they were \u201cjust jokes\u201d (and these things are never \u201cjust\u201d jokes,) you clearly were impacted and I\u2019m sorry your moms didn\u2019t take you more seriously. Props to your brother though for looking out for you. When you have a gut instinct, it\u2019s good to trust it.", "What you experienced was sexual harassment that has been swept under the rug and it\u2019s clearly impacted you. I\u2019d suggest seeing a therapist to help you find a way forward, and just explain to your family that you need to do what\u2019s in your best interest.", "NTA. Your uncle sexually harassed you, which is weird and gross. You have every right to not want to forgive him. What he did to you was wrong. He didn't apologize for what he did, so why should he get any forgiveness? Being sick doesn't give him a free pass or change what he did. I'm sorry that you had to go through that.", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to forgiveness.", "There is no reason to visit someone who treated you like a piece of meat, family or not.  NTAH.", "I would say NTA (or JAH at the most). He was abusive and you do NOT deserve that- your boundaries matter and it sounds like the people who want you to forgive him either don't know or have dealt with these comments before and feel they're normal (sad). Saying you were glad for something bad happening to him is a coping mechanism and may not have been the \"kind\" way to share your feelings but also you can't change your feelings nor should you have to for someone who treated you like that.", "NTA.  \n\n1.You don't owe anyone forgiveness. \n2. It is NOT weak to withhold forgiveness.\n3. He was disgusting and made you feel unsafe in your own home.  You owe him nothing.\n4. Your other family should have protected you. (Good on your brother and gpa for not forgiving him)\n5. You owe him nothing.\n\nTake care, and remember you have done nothing wrong here.\n\n\n\n\n(Edited to change \"insafe\" to \"unsafe\". )", "NTA \n\nBut please consider this: Forgiveness isn't for him. It's for you. \n\nPlease forgive him in your mind, not to his face. Those who have wronged us terribly like that have no right to know that we ever forgave them. It's something that we do just for ourselves. You don't need to tell your family or anyone if you don't want to. \n\nCarrying around that hatred and all those horrible memories will make you miserable for the rest of your life! Do you really want him to have that power over you? No! Forgive him silently so that you can move on and start to enjoy life and really LIVE! He'll be dead and gone forever soon but you will finally be free of him and that heavy burden. :-)\n\nEDIT: Please check out free or low cost counseling.
