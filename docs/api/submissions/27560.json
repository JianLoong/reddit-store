You are literally still working, does he expect you to quit your job to watch your grandkid? Tell him maybe you would if you could pay her what you'd make for your current job if not more.

You need to be working to pay your expenses and prepare for your future.  If you were willing to become a full-time childcare provider, your son would need to pay you enough to cover the loss of your income and benefits.  \n\nAlso, in this day and age, it's pretty rare for grandparents to be the full-time childcare for their grandchildren.  That was much more common in generational households than in the modern Western household.  So, even if you were retired, you still wouldn't be obligated to give up your time to babysit for free.\n\nAs for cookies, tell your son that you'll let him know next time you're making some so he can bring his child by to get some.  (I mean, what the heck, like \"making cookies\" is any measure if anything, right?)\n\nBasically, what your son is really complaining about is that being a parent is hard and expensive.  It sounds like he might qualify for government support.  Please recommend that he look into his options.\n\nAnd if you and your family can do so, offer to take the baby occasionally (like once every couple weeks for an afternoon on a weekend) so your son can get a break.  This isn't something you owe your son, but would be a kindness.", "NTA. \n\nGrandparents, regardless of their age, are not obligated to provide free childcare. \n\nDoes he expect you to quit your job too? And if so, how does he justify you losing that income since it\u2019s not like he plans on paying you. \n\nMost grandparents do not, in fact, provide free full-time childcare. Some do, but the majority do not. They may babysit from time-to-time, but childcare is the parent\u2019s responsibility. \n\nYou son is delusional and unrealistic expectations.", "NTA at all.

Put your foot down & tell your son he is the dad & he needs to figure this out on his own.  You are not responsible for caring for a child he brought into this world.   He needs to start adulting & arrange his own childcare while he's a work, because you & your husband have your own jobs. \n\nPersonally, I would raise the level of pettiness & tell him that since you've always thought we're such white trash anyway - why aren't you contacting the family of the tramp you left you high & dry for help......", "NTA you need your insurance and retirement will he pay for that? I\u2019m a gen Xer my grandparents watched us occasionally  (some summer visits or the occasional day) but never provided free childcare. \n\nIf your son is still living with you, I suggest you break down for him how much it costs to rent a room, his share of the cable and the grocery costs. Tell him that is your gift to your grandson and he has a year to find a stable job, a home and childcare\u2026 then if need be you will evict him. \n\nIt sounds like your son wants to dump his parenting duties on you, don\u2019t let him. This is between the mom & him to figure out. \n\nThe cookies? Buy store bought cookie dough in a tube, let the kid add magic sprinkles and bake.  \ud83d\ude09 I just use the joy of cooking recipe with dark chocolate chips & pecans when I could eat nuts. There is nothing wrong with semi homemade. Besides as a kid using the cookie cutter or cookie press or the roller plus the sprinkles are the best part to the kids.", "NTA \n\nSo you should take an income hit to look after his kid?\n\nHahahahahha\n\nNo", "In 1980, when my first child was born, my mother let me know she worked all week, and when she wanted to babysit, she would schedule the time with me. This is how it was. She would pick times and schedule ahead. We would plan our outings around these dates and times. She also would let us know when she heard of good daycare or babysitter, passing on phone numbers and info to us. We considered her the very best of grandmothers, no one better. Her grandchildren adored her. Fun, fun, fun, on her scheduled free time.", "NTA\n\nMake it clear to your son that you have a job, which is not working in daycare. If he doesn't want to put his child in daycare, then he can pay you a slightly higher price than the daycare would charge. As long as it's more than you make now of course.", "Nah OP you're nta, as a single parent sure one could sympathize with him trying to find a way to save money but once you said no and made it clear he needs to figure out another childcare situation or offer to pay at least if you're willing to watch your grandchild for payment. And I'd get that in writing with a signature so it can't be argued with if he tries stuffing stiffing you or any other bogus stuff", "NTA\n\nHe just wants you to step in as a mom/house-spouse, that is not your job.   \nEspecially with his low opinion of your family, I wouldn't help him beyond emergencies.   \nMillions of single parents raise their kids just fine, he needs to get his shit together.", "NTA", "NTA, where is his responsibility in all this. Suddenly you're a better fit than her family. You've raised your family, done your time and you still work. NOPE. Unless he's going to match your salary and it's for no longer than 9 hours per day, including school hours, I wouldn't entertain it. Occasional treats and babysitting is doing plenty.", "NTA  I can see why the mom left.  He probably told her it was her job because of the body parts she was born with.  What a gross pig.  I bet she didn't even want the baby and he either forced her or told her how AMAZING it would be.", "Smh. NTA. Why do young parents to be think they can pawn their kids off on their parents and their parents won\u2019t have an issue with it? Not all parents want to watch/hang out with their grandkids part time or full time. Your son needs to step up and figure it out. His situation sucks but nonetheless he chose to keep the child from the jump so be the parent you wanted to be. Also, if my kid decided that we were \u201ctrash\u201d, he most definitely won\u2019t be getting any help from me.", "You should encourage him to have the baby adopted by a loving married couple.  It doesn't sound like either one is parent material and you don't mention their ages, but I bet they are too young and immature to be parents.  Its in the baby's best interest to get adopted by 2 parents who love it before especially as a infant.  The novelty of having a baby for immature kids sounds great, but pretty soon they get tired of their responsibility.  Did you tell him to use a condom to make sure this didn't happen???  Sounds like you should have...", "Absolutely these recommendations. \n\nLook to assistance and where he can go.\n\n**Momma needs to pay child support.**\n\nGiving him a schedule for your assistance and telling him to stick to it would aid him recovering. Something smaller like 1 weekend a month of possible. Nothing weekly until he shows gratitude.\n\nHe was young, dumb, and he's still broke. At the end of the day though he hasn't given up his child for adoption or cps. If you suspect he's going to dump the kids and not come back you can contact the authorities yourself. The only real victim here though is grandbaby. They didn't ask for dumb parents.", "This right here. Yes, OP is younger and still working, but even if she were retired, she\u2019s not o located to devote her retirement to raising her grandchildren. Help out, sure. Respite care can mean the world to an exhausted parent. But dad is responsible for raising his child, not OP. NTA", "Suggest he contact the mother's family for grandma duties, since they were superior before they must still be now.", "Honestly, I think it depends on the grandparents.  I've known some grandparents who have never pressured their kids to have kids which sounds like OP.  Then there are the grandparents who actively pressured there kids to have kids like my MIL. There the ones who say they will help all the time. The problem is they don't always follow through. I can see why some kids feel cheated in the latter.  End of the day the parent is responsible.", "Lol! So what, he thinks your living expenses changed when he impregnated someone? Bwahahahaha! Wow.\n\nSo where is this sense of entitlement coming from? Is this because his grandparents took care of him when he was little or is this just out of the blue? And how come the \u201cbetter than us\u201d fam isn\u2019t the go-to-ask for childcare?", "Did her parents disappear too? He can drop he baby off with them. NTA", "Honestly depends if the mother can be tracked down when it comes to going after her for child support. OP said she disappeared, my guess is she\u2019s likely changed her contact info and her family/friends either don\u2019t know or won\u2019t tell OP\u2019s son her whereabouts. I think if he knew where she was, he\u2019d have been showing up to try and pass the kid back to her.", "Might have something to do with inflation and thr minimum wage not having been increased in years?", "I'm getting \"it takes a village\" vibes.... it used to be a positive thing, but is widely used by entitled people these days who want others to do for them", "It's not that hard to find people as long as they're not missing person missing. If she's missing missing their should be resources available to him- it's finding them that would be the hard part.\n\nEither way a lawyer should be able to get him started.", "It is possible that she only had the kid because he wanted it. If that is the case, the reasons for that are\u2026varied. \n\nThere is a lot of missing information because it is abnormal for a woman to birth a child, give it to the father, then split town.  However, it is likely that OP\u2019s son may have other \u201dcharms\u201d beyond expecting his mother to drop everything and care for his kid.", "And they have the money for that from...?"]}
