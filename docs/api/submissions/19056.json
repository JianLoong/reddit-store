You and your sons need that extra space and hopefully you can occupy it without any guilt.  Your brother is young and immature and obviously not thinking about anyone but himself.  This is the time to stand up for what you and your sons need.", "NTA. You\u2019re rooming with two kids, no brainer.", "NTA. He said you are \"...being selfish and entitled\". If he grabbed the bigger room, what would that make him? Bigger room for three people, smaller room. for two people. What's the problem with that?", "NTA, if you and the 2 kids are getting the bigger room, makes sense for 3 people to be in the big room, 2 in the other, especially as I assume you will have 2 beds in that room.", "It makes sense that you and your boys have the bigger space. Why wouldn\u2019t he want his old room back?", "NTA You're going to be sharing with 2 children.  You need more space. It's got nothing to do with being entitled, it's simple logistics.", "NTA - Three people should get the larger room than two people. It's gonna be difficult for you regardless, to have to room with two children. Also, I don't think girlfriend should count in the equation, anyway. I don't understand why she's moving into your parent's house and not fending for herself (or going back to her parents). It's really 3 v 1.", "Info: are you all paying rent? Are you paying the same amount?", "I go with NTA\n\nIt's difficult to determine who is the \"asshole\" in this situation because perspectives and emotions can vary. However, it seems that there are different points of view and personal histories at play. They should be understandable of the situation, as you have two kids, where as they dont, and you pay rent too...\r  \n\r  \nIt's understandable that you have taken on a caregiving role for your brother and may feel entitled to certain considerations. However, it's important to communicate your needs and boundaries effectively, rather than expecting others to automatically understand or meet them.\n\nFinding a solution that respects everyone's needs and boundaries is crucial. Open dialogue, empathy, and compromise can help foster understanding and avoid unnecessary conflicts within the family.", "NTA\n\n4 People > 2 People.\n\nLogically speaking (and logic is the only thing you should use when making decisions like this): 4 humans need more space than 2 humans. There's literally no debating that", "ESH. Flip a coin or have one of you pay more rent to get the bigger room. Neither of you are entitled to it and you don\u2019t get more of a say than he does. \n\nI mostly feel bad for your parents having their adult children all move in at once and act like\u2026not adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is being selfish and entitled. Tell him that he can have the bigger room only if he wants to share with your kids. You\u2019ll need to put 2 or 3 beds in your room versus his one that he shares with his gf. Logistically, the only reasonable option is to have the kids in the bigger room.", "NTA the fact 3 people are sharing one room makes them entitled to the bigger room. I would but a lock with a key.
