When mom turned 18 her parents kicked us out of the house. Mom did okay for a while but without any real support eventually she fell apart. When I was 6 I ended up in foster care and a few months later mom died. After that my grandparents took me in out of guilt. \u2013 The point is I will never let this happen to my daughter. If she keeps the baby I will support her in every way that I possibly can. \n\nSo far she\u2019s been insistent about keeping it. I get the feeling the boyfriends not as keen on the idea. I don\u2019t blame him, he\u2019s supposed to start in the engineering program at a damn good state school in the fall.\n\nConversations with my daughter have been a toss-up. Sometimes she shocks me with her maturity. Other times it\u2019s like a soap opera. I\u2019ve tried to be diplomatic. Tell her what the expectations will be if she keeps the baby and assure her that we will be here for her. But also tell her about adoption. Which I think is the best option. I\u2019m just not sure my daughter is in a healthy enough place to raise a child. \n\nShe has temper problems and does some risky stuff. Nothing too extreme, general teenage recklessness. And the temper is something she\u2019s been working on for a while. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my daughter has a wonderful, kind heart. She is intelligent and brave. She will be a wonderful mother someday. But right now she doesn\u2019t always think before she acts and I\u2019m worried about how that could affect a child.\n\nThings came to a head over the weekend. Her boyfriends oldest brother is married with a 1yo. They offered to adopt the baby. My husband and I found this out on Friday night after she threw her boyfriend out of the house. My younger daughter overheard them and told us what happened. He told her about the offer, she got offended because she felt like he didn\u2019t want the baby and told him to leave. \n\nMy husband tried to comfort our daughter while defending the boyfriend, it didn't go well. I had him leave the room and let my daughter be upset and vent for the night. \n\nSaturday morning I called the boyfriends mom and she explained things to me. The older brother and his wife want to have their kids close in age so they\u2019ve been thinking about getting pregnant again. When they heard whats going on they decided to offer to step in. This sounds like a dream scenario to me for a number of reasons. \n\nAfter I got off the phone with BM, I tried to talk to my daughter about it. To tell her what a good offer shes been given. She freaked out. Said I and everyone else is against her. That we don\u2019t love her or her baby and that I've become just like my grandmother. That part hurt, she knows my history with my grandparents. Ive told her Ill support her if she keeps the baby but I want better for her than that life. Im not trying to alienate her.

Specifically, my wanting her to give the baby up for adoption to its paternal uncle. -- This might make me the AH because even though she is a teenager, she's entering parenthood and needs to make her own decisions as a parent. Also, I've tried to not push her too hard, but if I am pushing, then I think that might make me the AH too. It is her child after all and she has to be the one to make the decision. So if she feels I've forced her then some way then I think that would make me an AH.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The boyfriend\u2019s brother & his partner can be more than just an option, they can be part of the support community that helps your daughter with that first year and beyond. If she is insistent on keeping the baby but everyone undercuts her confidence by encouraging her to give the baby up, it\u2019s going to be a challenge for her to believe in herself. \n\nThere\u2019s not a right answer when it comes to a situation like this. I think the best option is to support her and be sure that you are viewing her as her own individual in a different context and environment than your own mom, and make sure you are talking to someone because this sounds like it could open up old trauma wounds. Different time, different people, and although there could be similarities, you sound like the kind of parent who would support your child no matter what and help her in loving and caring for this baby.", "Nah.\n\nI know where you're coming from. I respect it, but once you've laid out her options, you need to let her make her own decision. \n\nStop pushing. Just let her make a decision. \n\nAsk her what she wants. Does she want to go to college, is she going to work etc. Let her lead with what she wants. This is a very big decision, and she just needs to feel some form of control and support. She's got so many people with different opinions that she probably can't even think straight.", "NAH.  \n\n\nYour daughter is both a teenager and pregnant. Her body is full of all sorts of hormones. In this moment, she thinks she wants to keep the baby and raise it as a single mom. Three months after giving birth when she realizes that she's the one who's got to change all the diapers and she's the one who's going to be waking up every hour to console the baby, she may come to regret her decision. Or, she may not. Maybe being a single mom at 17 will be the best thing that ever happened to her. We don't have a crystal ball. We can't know that. But it's her body and her baby, and it's not unreasonable for her to be defensive about keeping it.  \n\n\nThat being said, I don't think you're TA either. You're being realistic about the situation. For most 17-year-olds, being a single mom is not the best option. She is going to miss out on so much in life; she might not even finish high school. She has the option to give the baby to a financially stable couple. It is not unreasonable for you to think this could be the best situation for everyone.  You've made it clear to your daughter that if she keeps that baby, you're going to help her and support her as best you can, but that you don't think keeping the baby is the best option. I think you have her best interests in my mind. I think you're a good mom.  \n\n\nThat being said, your daughter is pregnant teenager. Her mind is probably not in a rational place right now. I would say stop trying to argue with her for now. She knows the adoption option is on the table. Maybe after a couple months of trying to raise a baby, she'll decide adoption is for the best. But right now, arguing with her is not fruitful.", "If your daughter did want to give the baby up for adoption, this could be a good scenario. You seem to know the family and trust them. But she has to be on board with adoption, not just talked into it because a convenient person popped up. \n\nAnother thing to think about is the only reason this is a good scenario is that you know and trust them. It\u2019s not a guarantee that she\u2019ll ever have contact with her baby again. She is likely to break up with this bf and lose her connection to the family. HE will always have access to the baby, but she might not. In an alternate reality where they stay together, get married, have more kids, she might always wonder what-if when she sees her kids play with their \u201ccousin\u201d.  Or she could always be at peace with the decision. \n\nYou also don\u2019t likely know that much about them. How serious even are they? Was this something there really thought about? Were they open to adoption before or is he just trying to help his brother? Is he wife fully on board? Do they have similar values? There\u2019s a lot to think about. \n\nI think you\u2019re trying to keep your daughter\u2019s best interests in mind, but ultimately it\u2019s her decision. If you\u2019re willing to support her no matter how she decides, make sure she knows that. Talk to her about all the possible outcomes. Figure out your own boundaries. Are you willing to raise the baby if she wants to go to college? Are you only intending to financially support her while she raises the baby herself? What kind of visitation would the father (and/or his family) have? I think all of you need to figure out what you\u2019re willing to do and go from there. NAH", "NAH \n\nYou\u2019re doing your best to share your experience with her and it seems also show her there\u2019s nothing wrong with making a choice to not keep her baby.\n\nShe\u2019s doing her best to make a massive decision while impacted by big emotions (& hormones). \n\nMaybe right now she just needs a supporting shoulder and ear. Having people on all sides telling her what\u2019s best can be overwhelming and also isolating (even when you\u2019re all coming from good intentions and love).\n\nJust be there for her and let her work through her thoughts and feelings", "I see a lot of people commenting YTA I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say NTA. You have been supportive and have continuously said you\u2019d be there for her. Let\u2019s face it at the end of the day she is 16 and while plenty of teen moms have raised wonderful children it is not an easy route to go down her life will become exponentially harder. I\u2019d say you want the best for her but, she may not realize that and at the end of the day if you do want to be as supportive as you say you do you\u2019ll have to drop the talk of adoption. If wanting to keep the baby is what she wants and you\u2019ve said you\u2019ll support that decision you need to do so but letting her know all of her options does not make you an asshole. At least that\u2019s my 2\u00a2.", "Nta but I don't think she's ready ask if she's ready to be a single mom and not have the life her friends will you need to get frank with her you know being a teen mom is no walk in the park.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You want to help, that's nice, but she's mother in progress and she wants the baby, she loves it already and want to be a mother to it. Saying you should give it up is... Is so brutal to her. I know you think she'll \"ruin\" her life and maybe that's true to some point or that she is not ready and that may be true too but how else should she learn to be a mother than... than just be her? I know your point really, but for example my dreams are travel and family, big, being mother and wife. Maybe her dream is also being mother, and now, sooner than expected, but still her dream is coming true. I totally sense that she now feels that you are not supporting her, you said you would, so do, but know that telling her to give her baby away is... Hurtful. On more levels.", "I mean did you tell her about abortion or other adoption options? \n\nShe obviously wants this baby and wants to be reassured about keeping her baby and I think if she has her family's help then you should just continue with telling her you will be there for her because it really looks like you want her to give her baby up and that is just so hard regardless her young age.\n\nI understand but this really is a decision which while should be an informed one is really up to her and I could see you being the AH if you continue to push it", "Definitely NTA-your daughter does still sound like a child, so you do have the job of teaching her to consider all the options. You told her you\u2019d support her if she decided to keep the baby, but you also told her to think it through and consider all the options. \n\nYou are a good and decent parent, and your daughter definitely still needs parenting if she\u2019s still throwing tantrums.

With all the detail given, and assuming everything you wrote is true and complete.  Your teenage daughter has two choices.  1)  Let older brother of BF adopt the kid.  2)  Become a single mother without support from bio daddy.  \n\nThis is a clear win/lose type of situation.  If the adoption is open (meaning, she can visit the child) that is amazing...and she'd be a damn fool to turn down the offer.\n\nBut to not let the bf's brother adopt?  It doesn't matter if grandma supports them, her life is over before it has a chance to start.  Think of it.  Marriage is out of the question, college is out of the question.   If grandma can't foot the bill, she's on the public dole for her whole life.  But even if grandma can foot the bill, that shouldn't be grandma's bill to foot.", "YTA. To have such a history and not ensure your daughter was on birth control. You really let her down and now she\u2019s forced into a position a 17 year old isn\u2019t mature enough to handle.", "YTA. I get you want your daughter to have a brighter future, but this is her child and her choice. Forcing her to give the baby up to adoption is not that different from kicking her out like your grandparents did with your mother and you.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter has been clear about the fact that she wants to keep her baby. And a child being adopted by a family member never ends well for the kid.", "YTA\n\n\nSupport your daughter to keep her baby no matter what her bf thinks.

Also, this could cause her legal trouble someday, especially since the relationship might not last and then the older brother still has rights over HER child. No way!", "NTA, but maybe back off a bit. You can make rules like if she stays at your house with a baby she has to finish school and you'll only help with daycare costs while she's in school or whatever you want. You are fully justified in how much or little you want to help and laying down ground rules before she has the baby is completely understandable. You gave her all options and opportunities and she doesn't want them, so she's made her decision. If she wants to jump headfirst into adulthood, let her make her own adult choices. \n\nI have no idea why there's such strong Y T A votes here. Babies are incredibly hard and can be the best thing that could ever happen, or the worst. Especially as a teen mom who's boyfriend has no interest in being a parent. Like anyone who's never been a parent before, it's impossible to know what it will be like and how you will feel, so she is approaching this situation naively with the experience of a teenager. It's not a bad thing to make sure your teenager understands the consequences of her actions as much as possible, especially with something that will end up being a huge life change and responsibility for the parents/stb grandparents as well.", "NTA you are trying to help her to see every option and you have a unique insight to do so.", "YTA.", "Tbh, as a mother of a teen daughter I\u2019d be absenting myself from any decisions.

According to your post she's never expressed any desire to either get an abortion or give the baby up, yet instead of being the supportive parent you claim to be, you try to coax and bully your daughter into giving the baby up against her own will. That's not supportive. \n\nIt's your daughter's life, and it's your daughter's decision. She's being perfectly clear what she wants to do and it's time you respect that if you want to keep her and the baby in your life. \n\nYTA.", "Yta. She\u2019s made it clear she wants to keep her baby and you\u2019re constantly trying to convince her to give it up. You said you\u2019d support her yet you keep pushing her to do something she obviously doesn\u2019t want to. \n\nHere you have a 17 year old who is mature enough to take responsibility for her actions and say she\u2019s going to raise her own child instead of push that responsibility to someone else so she can have a \u201cbetter life\u201d as you put it. You yourself are a mother but don\u2019t want that life for her?!? Being a mother is the most fulfilling and beautiful thing and your trying to manipulate and push your daughter to give that up. Do you not realize how many mothers REGRET giving up there child and never get over that guilt?!? You are just like your grandparents. Your mother obviously fought and put up with hell to be able to raise you herself and here you are pushing your daughter to give up her child because YOU don\u2019t think she is ready. She\u2019s clearly more mature than you are.

Best of luck to you both.", "NAH. Though instead of just trying to convince her to give up the kid, maybe have a serious conversation about her actual plan.\n\nIs she going to college and planning on just dumping the kid with you? Is she working on getting a job or just planning for you to fund the child? Is she planning on staying with you or moving someplace else with the child? \n\nIf her plan is basically \"parents will deal with the tough stuff\" then be honest and tell her that's not a plan. You'll be there to help, but you aren't becoming a full-time mother to your grandchild. It's not fair to the child if she plans to spend her kid's formative years away at college then try to jump cold turkey into full time parenting. \n\nSometimes talking through a situation helps people come to their own realizations.", "I think I have been letting my own childhood color my view of this situation a bit too much. My relationship with the memory of my own mother is... complicated. There isn't much to remember, since I was so young. I know my mother loved me deeply. But in many ways, she just didn't have the facets necessary for parenthood. I think maybe I've been projecting onto my daughter a bit. Plus, my mother lacked the skills to be a parent because her own parents left her in her time of need and she didn't have the resources to live up to her potential. My daughter has me, and I can give her resources, but she won't accept them if I push her away by pushing this adoption. \n\nLuckily, my daughter has been seeing a therapist weekly for a year now, so she has an impartial adult to talk things over with. I owe her an apology. I think you're right, I think I need to talk to someone so that I don't let my own trauma color the way I treat my daughter. She needs her mother right now. And I'm not doing our relationship any favors by reopening the same conversation. Family therapy might be a good idea as well... \n\nThank you. Your response has given me a lot to think about.", "Considering everything. I think part of the reason why she flipped from tolerating the adoption conversation to being really upset by it so fast was because I think maybe she felt kind of blindsided by her boyfriend bringing up the brother wanting to raise the baby? \n\nI was looking at it as \"Oh this could work out really well. As long as we get lawyers to draw up good adoption papers that protect her rights this could be great, keeping the baby in the family.\" But I've really been trying to reflect on why she got so upset and when I look at things from her perspective, I think it's possible that she felt like her boyfriend and/or his family went behind her back in some way? Like she wasn't thinking about how things could work out, she was probably thinking \"Did he really go discussing what to do with *my* baby without involving me in the discussion in the first place?\" And I've got to admit, if that's how she felt, then I can't blame her for not trusting him or the family. \n\nThen me coming at her so soon afterwards trying to talk about how it could potentially be a good opportunity probably felt like I was betraying her and on their side too. Ugh. I hate myself for this. I really just wanted her to consider the options but now that I'm trying to see this from her perspective she must just feel so betrayed and blindsided right now. \n\nI have to stop meddling. I just have to let her make her own decision.", "Thank you for your comment. I really am trying my best here. I don't want to push my daughter to make a decision she will regret, but it's hard to accept how much more difficult her life is going to be from this point on. Even with our help. \n\nI will say that no matter what she decides I have full faith in her finishing school. She's switching to online school because she doesn't want the kids at her current school to know that she's pregnant. Since she only needs a few more credits to graduate, she's planning on doing classes in the summer to get ahead and as long as she keeps up with school (which, even when she was skipping half her classes, she always got good grades, so I believe she will keep up) she will be all set to graduate early in December! That is one aspect of this situation that I think has really shown her potential and maturity.", "I think the daughter is just fascinated by the thought of having a baby, and hasn\u2019t realized how stressful babies are. So she doesn\u2019t realize that everyone is doing this from a good place. Plus the baby will remain in the family with people she knows, unlike adoption to strangers. Her daughter needs to view it from all angles, not just be excited by a baby.", "I wasn't trying to tell her what to do. I just want her to consider it. But I still think you and others are right. Even if I'm not *trying* to tell her what to do, bringing it up repeatedly when she's been steadfast in her decision isn't much better. \n\nAnd I see your point about how it could feel like I'm not supporting her. Again, I've only been trying to get her to consider her options more but if she doesn't want the options and the options are all I'll talk about then that isn't really being supportive like I want to be. I suppose it's time to accept my daughter's decision.", "My daughter is against abortion. My husband and I are both pro-choice and always have been, but she isn't. \n\nI think this post really makes it seem like I've *only* talked to her about adoption. But I really promise we have discussed what would happen if she kept the baby, in depth even. I told her I'd want her to have a part-time job after the baby was a few months old, and until then we'd completely support her financially. After the baby is a bit older and could be away from her for awhile, we'd still support her financially but she'd have the part-time job to help her contribute. Whether or not she goes to college is her choice, but we discussed her either going to trade school or taking a few online classes at the local community college while she figures out what to do with her life. She doesn't really want to work. She told us that instead of that she wants to go to cosmetology school full-time. My husband and I have differing opinions on this. I'd like her to work but I'm fine with her going to cos school full time and financially supporting her through that because in two years she could already be set with a decent career. My husband thinks she should have to work either way and I get his point but I don't know. \n\nAnyway all my point is is that we have explored the possibility of keeping it. Abortion she was absolutely dead set against so I let it go after she said no. She seemed kinda open to the adoption conversation at first. I think that might have just been to humor us though. When we talked about adoption she didn't engage in the conversation like she did when we talked about her keeping it. She just sort of nodded along and avoided eye contact. Sometimes she'd get annoyed and snippy but that's also happened a few times during the \"keeping it\" convos. It wasn't until the boyfriend's brother and sister-in-law made the offer to adopt the baby that she freaked out about it. I think she was fine with humoring everyone with the conversation when it was more of an abstract possibility. But once there was a more concrete potential to the adoption idea she couldn't pretend to be kinda-okay with it anymore. \n\nBut, if I'm being honest, even if she entertained the adoption conversation I could tell her heart wasn't in it. I agree, if I'm not already the AH, I will be if I keep pushing.", "I don't think the father will abandon the child. Whether or not he and my daughter stay together, I don't know. But I know the kid pretty well and I don't think he'd go AWOL -- at least not completely. Besides, we did have a sit-down conversation with my daughter, my husband, the boyfriend, and his parents a few weeks ago and his own parents made it pretty clear that even if they couldn't exactly force his involvement, they would not be okay with him shirking the responsibility. With my help, I do still think my daughter could get through college. She can be pretty determined when she puts her mind to something. Though, at the moment college is not in her plans. She wants to do cosmetology school. Which could earn her some decent money so I have no real issue with that. -- I'm happy to foot the bill to give her time to get on her feet. \n\nObviously, I don't want her to deal with all of these complications so early on in her life. But I do think she can overcome them.", "She was on birth control. You could have asked first before assuming.", "Just a point of consideration - a parent can provide resources for their child and accidents still happen. Birth control can fail. On the other hand, even though birth control was provided, a woman can choose to not utilize it as well. \n\nI don\u2019t know what was happening behind the scenes for OP and their daughter and all of the things I mentioned above could be true too.", "That\u2019s not actually a true statistic worldwide.", "Family adoptions tend to result in better outcomes for the kids than stranger adoptions. Obviously that doesn't apply here because the mom doesn't want it, but your statement that it never ends well is based on bias, not fact.", "Not arguing ur verdict, just wanna mention that some close family friends have adopted a kid from one of their relatives and it worked out amazing!", "When did OP insist? It seemed like she specifically mentioned that while she thinks the best choice is adoption she\u2019ll support her daughter no matter what choice she makes", "Shr's a child. Children don't make good parents. And she's a minor. Her parents are in charge of her health issues. \nSuoporting isn't always saying 'yes, you can do this'. \nAnd OP is more qualified to weigh in on this than most people, both as the mother and as a child who had a parent child.\n\nBabies aren't some accessories.\nIf she wanted to go vegan, mother can support her with it. This isn't a lifestyle choice, this isn't a bike. This is a human being. \n\nNTA.", "I'm not trying to argue your point at all. I respect your point. And you do make a good point that she will mature because she has to when the baby comes. \n\nI just do want to make it clear that I have never expressed to her that I won't think she will be a good mother. The only person I've expressed my concerns about her temper problems to is my husband. I would never tell her that I don't think she'd be a good mother, because I don't know that and it would only hurt her. It wouldn't do any good for anyone. \n\nAgain, I am not trying to argue your judgment. If I'm the AH then I'm the AH and I need to change my tune. But telling her she would be a bad mother is a line that I would never cross and I just wanted to make sure that was clear.", "You're entitled to your opinion. But one thing about my mother. She loved me dearly but she was also a drug addict and that's why I was taken away and put in foster care. And while in the process of trying to get me back she kept failing her drug tests because she couldn't prioritize her own kid over her drugs. Until she overdosed and died -- who knows if she did it on purpose or not. She was a wonderful person sober and addiction is a disease so it wasn't entirely her fault. It was complicated. But she didn't fight like hell to raise me. She gave up. And again, she was dealt a shitty hand. Her parents kicked her and me out the day she turned 18 and refused to help her in any way after that. But if she truly fought like hell for me then she'd be alive. \n\nI'll admit I've been less empathetic to my daughter than I should be. And I need to do a better job of supporting her. But don't talk about my mother if you don't know what that situation was.", "Lol, OP said daughter doesn\u2019t want to have to work. She won\u2019t be able to pay for the baby\u2019s needs.", "It\u2019s challenging, we are all a product of our own experiences and upbringing. \n\nTruly your daughter is lucky to have you. It takes so much more than just a mother to raise a child, it really takes a village, and it sounds like you are willing to be a significant part of that for her. I\u2019m glad she is working with a therapist too. My mental health issues are aggravated by pregnancy and it feels like an extremely out of control time given all the changing hormones and body changes.\n\nYou never really know how things will go; it\u2019s possible the bf isn\u2019t up to being involved and I will admit I\u2019ve seen that happen fairly often in my own family and outside of it with unexpected / young pregnancies, but I really do hope for the best for you and your daughter. \n\nFor some context as well, my partner and I waited a long time to have kids in thinking we wanted to be \u201cready\u201d with the perfect house, career, mental stability/capacity, and I watched a lot of family members have kids much sooner and with much less. The way these people grew up and change was astounding to me. In some cases it was truly life changing in a way I admire. Not every case but some. It made me think maybe I shouldn\u2019t have waited so long and I sometimes wonder what my life would have been like if we had kids sooner. \n\nI wish for all the best for you and your daughter \u2764\ufe0f", "Maybe from now on don't tell her \"I think\" ask her what \"she thinks\" you'll be able to have a much calmer conversation and still be able to make your own points if you come from this angle but she'll be much more receptive to whatever you want to discuss. She does need to understand her decisions from this point on are going to affect everyone, though, and not just herself. She's always going to be your little girl, but she's also about to be a mother, and sadly, this means you have to treat her more as a mum than your baby. I'm sure it's a hugely difficult situation for you right now, but try staying calm and almost detached while still supporting her, and you'll get through. She's got to start making her own choices now, even when that goes against your every instinct. Just be there to catch her when she falls, and you'll already be doing a better job than your own grandparents. NAH.", "I need to point something out here. You say you're pro CHOICE, but not respecting her choice?", "I know some teenage moms that make good parents, maybe I am biased there. \nBut for this, support of the family is needed. \nThis applies for everybody without own income.\n\nIf I would have been pregnant during my studies, I would have had an abortion. But no chance I would give away a baby. \n\nI wonder, if abortion was ever an option? I can understand that it's a family decision what happens with the baby. But if OP is telling her daughter \"We will support you with every decision you make\" then I would expect as OP's daughter that I will be allowed to keep the baby and will get support raising it. Otherwise OP should be honest, if she preferes not to keep the baby.", "The issue is, that you tell on the one side, you support her and in parallel you try to convince her to give the baby to her BF's brother. This is the equivalent of telling her, that you don't want her to keep the baby because they will be better parents.\n\nShe is a 17 pregnant girl, so she has quite some mental load at the moment. I wonder why she has to make the decision immidiately. Why can't she have a healthy baby first and then do her best to be a good mother? If you put a lot of pressure on her like everybody is doing now, she will maybe give the baby away against her inner believes.", "I stopped talking about abortion the moment she said no abortion. She's wanted to keep the baby from the beginning but she was okay with talking about adoption at first. It wasn't until the boyfriends brother made an offer that she closed off to the conversation. \n\nI'm not forcing her to change her choice. I've been pushing too hard for her to consider adoption and I'll admit that. But I have always made it very clear that our house is her home and if in the end she keeps the baby then they both will be loved, we will help her, and we will keep taking care of her so that she can take care of her baby. I've never done anything to make her feel like she is trapped into only one decision. Yes, I've pushed and that's not right. But I am still reminding her that nothing she could ever do could make her father or I love her any less or abandon her.", "She wrote that her daughter is insisting not to have an abortion. It is very clear from the post that while both parents (and boyfriend maybe) would support all decisions, her keeping it, is their least favourable option.\nAnd some teenage moms aren't all teenage moms.", "She doesn't have to make a decision immediately. But I just wanted her to consider it rather than saying no right away (I really didn't word my title accurately.) I've sort of been trying to go at it with an attitude of \"If you choose to keep this baby, we can do x, y, and z and I'll make sure you have everything you need and help you by doing a, b , and c. But why don't we also consider this other option and then this is how that would work.\" I just want her to be able to live her life. But, at the end of the day, I don't get to decide how she does that.  But I don't want to push her into making a decision she regrets. If she were to sign away her rights and then regret it later on and never get her baby back, I would never forgive myself. I guess I've just been frustrated because I feel like shes sprinting down this really intense and scary path and it doesn't seem like she's even stopped for a second to consider how hard it will be. And I don't want to scare her, but I feel like she's just not thinking about what this decision really means for her life and her future. So I'm just... frustrated. But, at the end of the day, I have to let go. I have to let her be her own person and trust that I've raised her well enough for her to take on this experience. She's an incredibly strong girl. I should give her more credit. If she's made up her mind, then I should probably get out of her way and find a way to accept things. \n\nI'm sorry. At this point, I'm just rambling. I think it's just hard to realize that I haven't been as understanding toward my daughter as I want to be. I'm just really scared of what the future has in store for her with all of this. But it won't help her if I undermine her confidence and make her think she can't do this. I know she can do this... I just... don't want her to have to.", ">She wrote that her daughter is insisting not to have an abortion. \n\nI only read in OP's post, that the daughter insists on keeping it. But nothing about the circumstances. Does OP's daughter assume she will get support by her BF and both grandparents? Or will she change her mind, when nobody will support her?\n\n>And some teenage moms aren't all teenage moms.\n\nExactly! That's why nobody can know, if a person will be a good parent until having the first child. OP is doing her best in discussing the options with her daughter. But maybe OP's daughter would prefer to get support regarding \"Keeping the baby after birth\" instead of talking about adoption. With 17 she's nearly an adult and with every year she can become more mature. Especially if she gets help by OP.\n\nLike I said, maybe I am biased there. In my country you'll get financial support when you are getting kids during school / studies and you are an adult with the age of 18.", "You are doing your best and thinking in solutions. You aren't AH on purpose, you have the best intensions. But persons have different paces to process their thoughts. Like you described your daughter's reaction, she currently has to handle a lot of expectations and thoughts from her environment in addition to her own thoughts an feelings. She needs some time to calm down and then it will be easier for her to plan her next steps.\n\nMaybe she is to naive to approach this. But many parents are, independent from their age. Most important is, that she and the baby are healthy. She won't be a perfect mother, but nobody is and this has nothing to do with her age."]}
