That's excessively cruel. She was a child when she came to live with them, do you think she was in a good place when that happened?

You told her exactly what she needed to hear. And then you didn't entertain it any further,  by telling your fiance you wanted to go home. Who cares if sister in law is mad?! Let her coddle her all she wants. What you said is true. And in the future, if she says that kind of stuff to you again, I think you should remind her of your place in the family since she may forget once she sobers up.", "So\u2026 ESH\n\nShe threw the first punch and clearly deserved what she got. \n\nThat said, you are an adult and even if it wasn\u2019t abundantly clear to you that \u201cJenny\u201d is wrong in the head, the adult thing to do in this situation is to just say, \u201cYou\u2019re drunk, go sleep it off\u201d and ignore the rest. You don\u2019t have to be mean to someone just because they are being an AH to you.", "NTA\n\n I'm surprised you lasted this long. I would've told her all that and worse the first time she attacked me.", "NTA.  Jenny can dish it out but states crying when you point out the truth.  Ugh.", "NTA  \nJenny needs therapy, lots of it. Whatever happened with her family led to her fixation and fear of losing this family. But it is not an excuse to insult you and your place in the family.\n\nYou didn't trigger her abandonment issues, they were on full display when she confronted you. If your future SIL cares about Jenny she should stop putting the blame on you and get her friend some help.", "NTA but Jenny is and needs to move on with her life without this family.  Bravo \ud83d\udc4f", "ESH. Jenny\u2019s behavior is absolutely awful and inexcusable. She\u2019s a major AH. She deserved to be told about herself, but you took it too far.

That poor girl needs to go away to someplace quiet for 30 days where there is nothing but therapy.  She sounds like a mess.\n\nThat said, NTA and good for you OP, for standing up to this messy situation.  You've done nothing wrong.", "The question isn\u2019t whether or not the response is understandable , it\u2019s whether or not it\u2019s an AH response. \n\nYes the OP\u2019s response is understandable. \n\nAND\n\nOP\u2019s response is still an AH move."]}
