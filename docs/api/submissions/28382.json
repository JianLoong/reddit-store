NTA.\n\nAlso, if she really was his sister you'd kind of be the asshole as she'd likely have been around him for years before you. But she isn't, she's his ex, one that he's family is still keeping around - talk about clingy - like I read a similar post a few days ago. And man, the whole family is a bunch of assholes for choosing her over their own son. I feel bad for you and your husband. NTA. May be time to go no or low contact again if this keeps up.

Fuck her abandonment issues, they need to kick her to the curb wholesale and tell her that she is not part of their family and they won't tolerate her causing trouble for their ACTUAL family anymore.  \n\n\nI am a former foster kid who never got adopted. When I broke up with my abusive ex, a friend from our DND group offered to let me crash at his place because he knew I had nowhere to go and no one to turn to. His family practically adopted me - I go to holiday events with them, I watch their pets for them, they took me to and from the hospital during surgeries, they helped me get my first car, they call me their grandson's aunt. And you know what? I'd never pull that shit she did. I would never claim that I am more important to them than any of their ACTUAL kids, or claim that I had a right to a place in their family, because I do not. They chose to let me stay, they choose to include me, they can revoke that at any time and while it would hurt like hell, I understand that I am NOT part of their family and they owe me nothing. Do I have abandonment issues? Sure do! But that's MY problem, not theirs.  \n\n\nHis sister can stuff it. That woman has serious issues that they've been letting go way too far for way too long. It's well past the 'nip it in the bud' stage, at this point they need to yank it out from the roots and go scorched earth on that patch of dirt. She deserved every word of that and MORE. Do not let her around yourself or your kids. \n\nYou and your husband should pull out of any 'family' events she attends and make it very clear why, make absolutely certain she isn't at your wedding (and have security so if she tries to show up anyway or anyone tries to bring her, they can get kicked out promptly) and absolutely do not let her near your new baby, or yourself while you're pregnant.
