At this point you're just being sexist.", "There is no way that you can go through life where your refusal to be in a vehicle driven by a woman will be taken as anything other than disrespectful misogyny, no matter how you might try to explain it, because how you try to explain it would be exactly how a disrespectful misogynist might try to explain his refusal. Thus, I think it is incumbent upon you to work through this trauma. You seem to be quite complacent about it though, so I think YTA. This isn't just a fact about you that cannot be changed. Your gf might be tactless in saying you should get over it, but, well, ... you need to work to get over it. She shouldn't have to settle for being driven around by you when you go somewhere together. So this refusal of yours is putting a burden on her, which you don't seem to recognize. \n\nYou don't say anything about the effects of the phobia. What would happen to you if you were driven by a woman? If that has not happened for a very long time, then how do you know what the effect is? Perhaps you would have a full-scale panic attack--which would be one thing. But perhaps you would just feel scared, which would be quite another. If it's just feelings of fear, then definitely YTA. \n\nIt is very odd that the phobia attaches to women driving vehicles, rather than to the type of vehicle in question. Surely riding in a bus is more like the original accident than riding in a car with your gf? Phobia aren't rational, of course, but it is very strange that the gender of the person driving is what you have got stuck on. I doubt that you have pushed yourself to think through that enough.

Misogyny is a real thing and not to be taken lightly. Misogyny (hatred of women) is related to, but not synonymous with sexism. Misogyny is the root of sexism but everyone that has sexist views is not inherently misogynistic. Sexist views are largely cultural, and therefore can be held by people without hate in their heart. The key is to be willing and open to confront any sexist attitudes or beliefs when they are brought to your attention. A misogynist will cling to the sexist belief or defend the sexist actions. Everyone else\u2026well they\u2019ll learn and grow.\n\nIt could be that therapy \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d before because you were not ready/unwilling to confront reality. Or you could have had a shitty therapist, not all therapist are created equal and this is a big enough deal that you may want to keep trying until you find a good one.\n\nI agree with the assessment that your phobia has roots in misogynistic and/or sexist ideas or patterns you observed as a child before the accident. There is no other explanation. I have spent years in PTSD and trauma survivor groups, I have seen all kinds of fears, phobias, flashback triggering - never have I heard of a trigger being so generic. Any woman, any vehicle, no matter the circumstances. Yeah. That\u2019s a stretch for it to be rooted in just the trauma alone. A trigger that was informed on the trauma alone, could be \u201cmiddle aged dark haired woman driving a bus\u201d. Or whatever.\n\nYou are not an AH for having a phobia.

I.e., do you have a panic attack when you get in a car with a woman in the driver seat...or does it just make you uncomfortable and you do not want to try? \n\nPhobias are extreme fears. It's not a little thing. It takes over your entire life. It becomes a massive part of your person. And it can be managed/treated and sometimes even cured through therapy. If you truly have a phobia, you need to get professional help. If you're just scared the way many people are about various things, then yeah your girlfriend is right - you need to get over it. And if you don't want to, then you need to accept that this is going to break relationships and hurt you and others in the long run.\n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: apparently I don't have my reading comprehension glasses on and made a dumb misinterpretation of part of OP's post. I've taken the part I addressed that out because that was not what was actually said. Sorry!", "The fact that your phobia latched on to thinking the trauma was caused by the driver being female and not something more general like being in a bus or just driving is problematic, I\u2019m betting the bias against women was probably already there to an extent even just subconsciously. you\u2019ve mentioned no effort to work through it or try and push through it and that makes you the asshole", "I have trauma from a major car accident. Sexism and misandry are not side effects.\n\nYTA", "Yes!\n\nClimb down off the cross, use the wood to build a bridge and get over it.\n\nThe fact that you hold Women drivers responsible for what I am sure was a very traumatic event in your life is not right.\n\nWhat happened back then to you was caused by a series of unrepeatable (most likely) variables that all came to a head at that particular moment in time at that location.\n\nMale drivers, female drivers, whatever\u2026 we all have the potential to be impacted in the worst possible ways when we get into a vehicle and enter traffic.\n\nI\u2019m glad you are still here with us on this planet to share your story, but in this case your gf has a very valid point for how this is making her feel.\n\nIf you don\u2019t tackle this phobia now, it will haunt you for the rest of your days friend, don\u2019t live like that :)\n\nNext time you and your girl go out somewhere just walk right over to the passenger door and look at her and tell her you trust her.", "YTA - you seem rather selective and you don't mention things you've done to deal with your phobia. Your girlfriend's car is not yours to drive.", "YTA, get help.", "YTA. Purely because your phobia is directly harming others. Why can\u2019t gf drive her own car, that must suck! You should do what you can to eradicate this irrational fear you have.", "YTA. You got in one accident where the driver happened to be female, and now you have a phobia of being driven by women and refuse to address it? I get fears and phobias are irrational, but considering that you never looked for treatment or tried to overcome it makes you a jerk.\n\nAlso, the fact that you focused on the gender of the driver and not other factors (being in a bus, any road conditions, speed, etc) suggests that you may have mysoginsioc tendencies in general that you\u2019re unaware of.", "YTA. Seek help.", "YTA. Sure, it mainly inconveniences you, but how often are you late to work or to meet someone because you had to wait for the next bus? And what if you need an ambulance and it\u2019s only female EMTs on the team? You\u2019ve got to try therapy again. Hopefully someone with experience with phobias and/or practices exposure therapy.", "Agreed, it seems therapy is badly needed. Phobias are hard to get rid of with professional help, let alone by yourself.", "Yeah, it's been like 15-20 years, **get over it** OP (with professional help).", "i\u2019m curious what OPs opinion is if the driver is transgender??", "Yeah, this phobia of his is perpetuated by his deep-rooted misogyny. There\u2019s a reason his brain latched onto the idea of all women being terrible drivers instead of, say, old people being bad drivers or buses being dangerous vehicles.", "Therapy is expensive", "I have a family member who had multiple traumatic events (random assault and murder of a sibling) where the perpetrators were both of a race that is not my family member\u2019s. The way I explained it was that they had to work to heal their trauma, because it doesn\u2019t give them a green light to traumatize others through racism.", "Yeah, it's the \"oh well, nothing to be done, you're just going to have to accept that I will have to drive you forever\" bit for me.\n\nLike, no. It is unreasonable and unacceptable to ask your girlfriend to live this way.", "Also, he should have fun taking the bus down Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel because his girlfriend doesn't  need to put up with this nonsense.  You are a grown up man and your phobia should not impact her plans.\n\nI've worked in mental health.  You are not the asshole for having a phobia, but your parents and you are both TA for not dealing with this 15 years ago or whatever.", "This makes more logical sense than what OP is engaging in. You\u2019re saying I don\u2019t trust ANYONE, and hell, who can blame you. It is a giant metal death machine. Your control issues aren\u2019t based in a sexist paradigm.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case with the OP. He doesn\u2019t feel unsafe in a car driven by men. He makes no mention of even feeling fearful in a car/bus on any level. He still rides mass transit. No restrictions other than gender. Any age, hair color, body type - any vehicle. His expectation is that his loved ones accept his phobia as if it was the same as yours, when it\u2019s not. He is expecting to drive his GF\u2019s car as if it was his own when they\u2019re together. That\u2019s some balls. Him expecting others to accommodate his phobia, to the point of them giving up control of, maybe the most important physical possession they have - is entitled and irrational (beyond the phobia itself). There\u2019s a rational reason why you feel you need to be in control, you feel safer, even though that safety is an illusion. Is it annoying to your loved ones? Probably in certain situations. But they aren\u2019t being asked to accept irrational arbitrary behavior.\n\nOut of curiosity- What happens when you\u2019re unable to drive and you HAVE to go somewhere. Hypothetical, you\u2019re in a cast to your hip, and have to go in for a follow up x-ray. You wouldn\u2019t be able to drive safely, so what would you do? I have to believe that you\u2019ve thought of every possible scenario - and I\u2019m legit fascinated.", "Because he got into an accident with a female bus driver, on a bus, but isn\u2019t afraid to ride the bus, but is afraid to ride with women despite the accident being caused by a man.", "OP waving the ambulance on, \"I'll catch the next one.\"", "What happens if he\u2019s on a plane and the pilot is a woman.", "I hate to be that cat, especially because you clearly mean well, but at least if you're in the states, it's generally super insulting to call them an \"ambulance driver\". Except in very specific scenarios, the one driving the ambulance is at least an EMT, but could also be a paramedic. There's a lot of school, training, testing, and certification that goes into that. Depending on the level of care the patient needs, it's likely the one driving could just as easily be the one in the back. I was a paramedic in Texas usually paired with an EMT partner, and I would never let anyone call my partner an \"ambulance driver\". I super hope this came off as politely as I meant it to and not as an \"um actually\" moment, because it seems like you think highly enough of first responders, and a lot of people do this without knowing how it sounds.", "It's becoming more common  to team women up together due to the harassment women were getting with male coworkers in EMT settings. \n\n(No I don't have stats to back this up only the word of my sister and her coworkers who are EMT's)", "Yeah, like, would it be acceptable or not assholeish to have a race-based phobia because of a childhood car accident?  Hint:  no.", "Yup. Why zero in on the one characteristic the driver shares with half of the world\u2019s population?", "I have a phobia of syringes from a traumatic incident from childhood yet I still get vaccinated and have my blood drawn. \n\nI've experienced SA from multiple men on different occasions, I don't hold every man accountable and I'm around them daily.\n\nYou're an adult who has autonomy.

You're basically saying that as a couple, she's not allowed to drive HER car that SHE paid for that SHE'S insured for. You might not see it this way, but you're demanding that she hand over her agency to you because of your trauma.\n\nImagine if this were something else. Like demanding her bank information/funds because of something that happened to you in the past. When she leaves you (if she does) she will leave you with her car. Until you actually work on either getting over it or forcing yourself through it because it seems like you just can't be assed since 'it doesn't really bother me that much and I found a workaround', you're failing to see that it's bothering her. Or not caring enough. Either choose men to date so this isn't an issue or work on your phobia.", "Exactly, why is it the driver\u2019s gender that\u2019s so frightening.

It\u2019s pretty obvious this fear of X gender or X race would never happen if the driver were OP\u2019s race or gender.", "This is what I was thinking. Having a phobia of riding in a car after an accident is surely understandable but the fact that he latched onto the fact that the driver was a woman and is now *only* fearful of women drivers means he believes her being a woman contributed to the accident and that\u2019s indeed misogynistic. If he\u2019s so \u201cafraid\u201d to ride with his gf when she\u2019s driving her own car he can take the bus (assuming it\u2019s not being driven by a female bus driver) and meet his gf at their destination.

Don\u2019t come on Reddit with this when you haven\u2019t even attempted to address it properly.
