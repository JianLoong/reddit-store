At this point you're just being sexist.", "There is no way that you can go through life where your refusal to be in a vehicle driven by a woman will be taken as anything other than disrespectful misogyny, no matter how you might try to explain it, because how you try to explain it would be exactly how a disrespectful misogynist might try to explain his refusal. Thus, I think it is incumbent upon you to work through this trauma. You seem to be quite complacent about it though, so I think YTA. This isn't just a fact about you that cannot be changed. Your gf might be tactless in saying you should get over it, but, well, ... you need to work to get over it. She shouldn't have to settle for being driven around by you when you go somewhere together. So this refusal of yours is putting a burden on her, which you don't seem to recognize. \n\nYou don't say anything about the effects of the phobia. What would happen to you if you were driven by a woman? If that has not happened for a very long time, then how do you know what the effect is? Perhaps you would have a full-scale panic attack--which would be one thing. But perhaps you would just feel scared, which would be quite another. If it's just feelings of fear, then definitely YTA. \n\nIt is very odd that the phobia attaches to women driving vehicles, rather than to the type of vehicle in question. Surely riding in a bus is more like the original accident than riding in a car with your gf? Phobia aren't rational, of course, but it is very strange that the gender of the person driving is what you have got stuck on. I doubt that you have pushed yourself to think through that enough.

Misogyny is a real thing and not to be taken lightly. Misogyny (hatred of women) is related to, but not synonymous with sexism. Misogyny is the root of sexism but everyone that has sexist views is not inherently misogynistic. Sexist views are largely cultural, and therefore can be held by people without hate in their heart. The key is to be willing and open to confront any sexist attitudes or beliefs when they are brought to your attention. A misogynist will cling to the sexist belief or defend the sexist actions. Everyone else\u2026well they\u2019ll learn and grow.\n\nIt could be that therapy \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d before because you were not ready/unwilling to confront reality. Or you could have had a shitty therapist, not all therapist are created equal and this is a big enough deal that you may want to keep trying until you find a good one.\n\nI agree with the assessment that your phobia has roots in misogynistic and/or sexist ideas or patterns you observed as a child before the accident. There is no other explanation. I have spent years in PTSD and trauma survivor groups, I have seen all kinds of fears, phobias, flashback triggering - never have I heard of a trigger being so generic. Any woman, any vehicle, no matter the circumstances. Yeah. That\u2019s a stretch for it to be rooted in just the trauma alone. A trigger that was informed on the trauma alone, could be \u201cmiddle aged dark haired woman driving a bus\u201d. Or whatever.\n\nYou are not an AH for having a phobia.

I.e., do you have a panic attack when you get in a car with a woman in the driver seat...or does it just make you uncomfortable and you do not want to try? \n\nPhobias are extreme fears. It's not a little thing. It takes over your entire life. It becomes a massive part of your person. And it can be managed/treated and sometimes even cured through therapy. If you truly have a phobia, you need to get professional help. If you're just scared the way many people are about various things, then yeah your girlfriend is right - you need to get over it. And if you don't want to, then you need to accept that this is going to break relationships and hurt you and others in the long run.\n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: apparently I don't have my reading comprehension glasses on and made a dumb misinterpretation of part of OP's post.

Move ahead to my 1st husband. I was 22, we were going to Tucson to visit his parents. Middle of the night in the mountains outside of El Paso, TX, he is driving, doing about 60 on the road. This was 1980, I don't remember if it was Interstate or just highway. Suddenly he groans, goes stiff as a board, foot jammed to the floor on the accelerator. Couldn't get him to respond, his arms were locked to the wheel, feet to the floor, I managed to get a leg into his floorboard, my foot on the brake, trying to pull the wheel away from him, he suddenly sagged and I was able to get control of the wheel, half in his seat, half straddling the floor shifter. Steered to the side of the road, got the car in park, turned off the ignition and pulled the key. He was so out of it, took 30-45 minutes for him to make any sense, he felt sick, didn't know where he was, what was going on, etc. Remember, 1980, no cell phones, middle of the night, felt like the middle of nowhere. I finally managed to get him to change seats with me, he started feeling better, but was still iffy on memory. I wanted to go to a hospital, he kept refusing, kept saying 'call my dad'. I finally hit a closed gas station with a phone booth, called his parents in Tucson. Oh no, he'll be ok, just bring him here, he had a grand mal seizure, HE HAS HAD THEM ON AND OFF HIS WHOLE LIFE. What? What what what??? After a white-knuckled drive(me) the rest of the way to Tucson, it was explained to me that he had had a severe concussion when he was 8, and had had seizures occasionally since then. Long story short, we were divorced 6 months later(different issues), I married the love of my life 4 years later, was married for 37 years until his death 18 months ago, and I have VERY RARELY ever let anyone else drive me since 1980. The anxiety, door-grabbing, shadow-braking, etc. make being a passenger a very miserable experience for me, 43 years later.

It's how general this phobia is that is so strange.", "\"the bus driver was wearing a red shirt! I can never get a in a vehicle with red shirts again!\"\n\nYes, it is very telling what he latched on to.", "Yeah he was in a bus crash but would rather take a bus than have a woman drive?  Seems like he's focused on the wrong thing.", "He mentioned in a comment that the bus driver wasn't at fault and that it was a truck being driven by a man that hit the bus.", "  > Or when the ambulance driver is a woman\n\nLol you think he\u2019d wait for the next ambulance? \n\nOP YTA\nI hope you end up getting the proper help to treat your trauma and heal from that awful event. Good luck to you.", "Or the public transportation driver, which is more like a school bus situation anyway", "I was just going to say this same thing! EMDR is perfect for this. I know others already repeated it but seriously look into it!", "As an angry pedestrian (I can't drive, Im epileptic), I will notice if you barely do your stop or don't give me the priority when I should have it or just drive recklessly. Whenever I've missed being hit by a car or one didn't plan on doing their stop until they saw me...About 90% of those shitty drivers were men.", ">The accident was the cause, but something in the op\u2019s background added a misogynistic filter on it to blame it on the driver\u2019s gender and not something else.\n\nPerfectly put! And the fact that OP\u2019s parents actually catered to, fostered, and enabled this misogynistic idea strongly supports that. There was misogyny in place before, and then it just kept getting reinforced.", "I would guess it was through his family since his mom doesn't drive.", "it's even worse in Russia. I kid you not, every time car crash happens and the driver is male, the news is written like: \"this and that cars just crashed at that place yada yada, more details\". You can only know that the driver is male if you read further. But if the driver is female, than the article would specifically say: \"A woman, driving this and that car, knocked down two people\". This way people are actually assured that female drivers are much worse than male ones, which is not true in Russia at all. I mean, I was hit by a car last year, the driver was female, but at the same evening I witnessed another car crash and the driver was male. And people around me still tried to tell me that it's understandable that i was hit by a woman, they are SO much worse than men, omg. I've just checked the news about newest car accidents and yep, it's still written in a way that some cars are  just magically driving themselves and getting into crashes and the others are driven by women. Men either don't drive cars in Russia at all or they are too perfect as drivers.", "So it really is just 100% misogyny that he's pretending is a \"phobia\".", ">The front passenger seat is literally nicknamed \"death seat\" in my country.\n\nIn my country it's pretty similar: \"Lugar do morto\", which translates as \"dead man's seat\".", "tell your buddy jeff to stop putting on makup in his car, and watch the road.", "My partner doesn\u2019t speed over speed bumps for example but you best believe he slows all the way down to like 5mph when me, bump and my morning sickness get in the car", "Our dogs wear harnesses on walks and in the car, nothing fancy, just the regular kind for clipping a leash to so your dog doesn\u2019t choke himself pulling on a collar. The hook for the leash is on a strap and a seatbelt can be pulled through it and they\u2019ve got enough room to sit or lay down how they want, but not enough to really move around and endanger themselves or distract the driver. Highly recommend.", "YTA and you need therapy to process your earlier trauma. What happens in the future if you have to go on a work trip and need to ride with coworkers? You may not be able say no to one of them driving because they are a woman. How about if you are in a non car related accident and need an ambulance? You don\u2019t get to pick who\u2019s driving it. You need to figure your issue out and actually address it. Your \u201ccoping\u201d mechanism is incredibly unhealthy and unhelpful. You didn\u2019t get into a car accident as a result of the driver being a woman.", "YTA And this is damaging to your girlfriend.  This will be damaging to your daughters.", "I'm trying not to call YTA because 'irrational fears' are called 'irrational for a reason, everybody has them and they all sound equally stupid to whoever you tell them too. HOWEVER, this does feel like you are using a childhood incident to hide your misogyny.\n\nEither way this fear of yours is beginning to cause problems for both you and the women in your lives that care about you and its high time you got it check out.\n\nEDIT: Ok, I found out in the comments that you are fully aware that the accident that caused your trauma was because of a man driving a Truck. You admit that the woman bus driver may have saved your life that day and you're not afraid of being on the road with other woman drivers. \n\nYou are officially the AH", "Yta\n\nThen buy a car.\n\nYou got no right to demand your gf car", "Phobias are actually pretty easy to treat. It\u2019s a standard and effective protocol that most therapists know. So I have a lot of compassion for where the phobia comes from, but there\u2019s really no excuse for continuing to live with it forever when its causing so much functional impairment to your life.", "Just chiming in to agree with the comments about EMDR. I have PTSD from an incident where a loaded gun was pointed in my face. I couldn\u2019t see a gun without having panic attacks and I\u2019d often hear a noise at night while in bed and have panic attacks due to that. They were so frequent, several times a week. I did EMDR and now I can sleep and my panic attacks only occur maybe once or twice a month.", "Yes, this is the best take. \n\nOp if you listen to your girlfriend she is telling you have living like this makes her feel. Your reasons don\u2019t change that reality and it is a very real impact on her. It also may come up more as you age, join the workforce, maybe carpool with coworkers to conventions etc. You have been able to avoid your trigger and get other people to work around it, but that may not always be true.", "That is really what it boils down to. \n\nA lack of commitment to address it, and instead looking for assurance he's allowed to make these demands and behave like this is a red flag.", "Oh my god I want to throw up when I see pictures of fungus and mushrooms. Like physically ill. Even if \u201ceveryone\u201d has trypophobia I rarely meet someone who has a reaction like mine. Don\u2019t get me started on skin diseases. I will be barfing.", "Oddly enough I do have a friend who developed a race based phobia (specifically for seeing men in pairs where one was white and one was black, because her brain latched onto the appearance of the two men who violently attacked her in the street.) \n\nShe went and got specific treatment for it because she was able to recognise how, intentionally or not, that phobia was gonna cause her to behave in racist ways and that was unacceptable to her. Regardless of the reason, and the unpredictable nature of trauma responses, the end result was gonna be the perpetuation of bigotry and harm to other people whether she intended it to or not. \n\nYou can't choose what your brain latches onto, but you can definitely sit down with yourself when you're not in the grip of the trauma response and evaluate whether your phobia is damaging to people around you, and if so, what you're able to do about it to prevent that.", "\"I'm not sexist, it's a phobia..a phobia that wasn't caused by a woman but has manifested against all women drivers\" isn't the out he wants it to be.\n\nMisogyny is a prejudice against women and he's prejudice against women drivers. He doesn't seem interested in \\*changing\\* that so much as wanting approval to continue this cycle.", "Which is why insurance is so much cheaper for women, because we're TERRIBLE drivers!", "Just to give this guy the benefit of the doubt - PTSD can manifest in really weird ways that often make zero sense. Is it internalized or social misogyny? Maybe. But it may also just be an unusual trauma response.\n\nFYI, I'm a woman, and an attorney, who was told today by a potential female client they need a \"male\" attorney. Misogyny is alive and well, and OP is YTA regardless, but this isn't necessarily misogyny.", "Probably. It's odd that he isn't afraid of riding busses.", "Interesting take. While I get the root of phobias aren't always rational, as he's admitted, how he choses to continue to enable it is well within his agency.\n\nYour comments about control and what this phobia affords him aren't something I considered. It does seem to work out (sometimes) favorably when it comes to control.\n\nSide note: I think his GF has the car, he doesn't. So, one car and when he can't drive hers, he takes public transport.", "This is actually what prompted me to get my license. I didn\u2019t like being out of control of when I arrive somewhere or when I leave, or how the driver drives, so I got my license and have had a car since. My strong preference is to be the driver. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t have a car, so there\u2019s no real conflict when we go places (and I have let him drive us occasionally/borrow my car as needed (we don\u2019t live together)) but I\u2019m aware of this and tell people about it. Plus, my boyfriend likes the freedom of having a car but doesn\u2019t drive well (he stops too fast, doesn\u2019t pay attention to the curvature of the road, all the little things that add up to his passenger functionally getting whiplash on a trip of any length) because he doesn\u2019t care about driving, so there\u2019s no conflict for us the way there is for OP.\n\nOP is just a misogynist who needs therapy to stop blaming a woman for an accident a man caused.", "Some AH drivers think honking confers right of way.\n\nI got hit on my bike going to college.

Maybe has a phobia of being driven by brunettes? Christians? Glasses wearers?", "Seconding EMDR, it helped me deal with my anxiety and PTSD related to trauma. Help yourself OP, it's so worth it!", "As someone who has had emdr I can verify it as a very good resource that can be traumatic to experience but it\u2019s worth it. Depending where, a good therapist will take a few months ensuring you can be given this method safely. You have to set up a safe space and will have nightmares for a few days after each session, go into it prepared. It is the only known thing that helps flashbacks and ptsd trauma to this extent so just be prepared.\nI heard something recently and now I use it, it\u2019s okay to be scared, but you an be brave and scared at the same time. Goodluck", "Or Prolonged Exposure Therapy.  That's what finally worked for me after my accident. \n\nYou have to be committed though, and PTSD therapy is hard.  You can't give up. You've gotta stick with it.", "So glad you also had good results!", "Love that.\n\nETA: I love your saying, I meant. Not your phobia. But I also love that you\u2019re facing your phobia. That takes so much courage, and this rando stranger is proud of you!", "YES x1000 to your second sentence.

I don\u2019t often get car sick but every now and then my husband sometimes literally makes me throw up with all his sudden accel-decels and aggressively sharp turns. Like pull over. *Now*.", "Exactly this. When you're driving, your awareness is on the vehicle itself and on everything happening outside of it. But when you have a passenger, you pay extra care because you're also having to be aware of everything *inside* the vehicle. I've driven goods vehicles for work and the same is true for carrying loads - I'm a careful driver all the time, but there's a big difference in level of care required when you're in an empty van compared to a fully loaded vehicle.", "This puts it perfectly into words.....I have been trying to explain this to my husband and dad who drive the same whether they are alone or have others in the car. They don't get that even if we see the red light or the turn we know we are taking we can't predict exactly when to brace and God forbid I'd I'm looking at my phone or something LMAO I feel like a ragdoll", "This is exactly how I drive when I have my dog in the car. Much slower on braking, turns, and acceleration. I don't make turns in front of oncoming traffic unless they are far enough away from me that I can do so slowly and safely, and I'm fine staying behind someone going under the speed limit even if I could safely pass them. It's a lot like how I drive when I'm hauling a horse trailer. My passengers are usually an animal, and they aren't able to vocally consent to a lot of things in their life, so the least I can do is drive like they are made of glass. I don't ever want something they experience while with me to make them afraid.", "I witnessed a really bad car accident when I was about 7 years old. We were second in line at the red light. Light turns green, first car slowly goes into the intersection we made it into the crosswalk before BAM! A van going full speed crashed into the first car spinning it around. Can ended up in the parking lot across the street. We backed up a bit. There were many kids in the van, all rightfully scared but I don\u2019t remember any of them looking seriously injured. \n\nThis has always made me pause when the light turns green and before I anticipate it will, I am checking both ways to make sure no one is coming and not paying attention. I am always under the assumption that people aren\u2019t paying attention while driving and I think that has kept me from many accidents. I also try to keep track of every car surrounding me for as far as I can see."]}
