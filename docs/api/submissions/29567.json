{"id": 29567, "submission_id": "17fd11n", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter she has to invite everyone in her class to her birthday party?", "selftext": "My daughter is in 6th grade, she turns 12 next week. She is well liked and has many friends in her class. She\u2019s really excited about her birthday, and she told me she wants to have a \u201ccool\u201d birthday this year. In the past, most of her birthday parties have just been at our house with 10-15 people - some of her class friends and also her cousins and grandparents. She\u2019s changed a lot this year, though. Middle school and all. So anyways, I asked if she wants her birthday party to be at a new laser tag place that opened nearby, and she was really happy. \n\nShe\u2019s been planning the color scheme, theme, and decorations enthusiastically, and she even made invitations online that she asked me to print out. I asked her if she wants me to print one for all the girls in her class, and she said she\u2019s inviting everyone except 2 girls. I asked why and she said she doesn\u2019t like those girls. She said no one really likes them. This bothered me so I pressed her, asking if they\u2019ve ever been unkind to her. She said no, but they have no fashion sense and they\u2019re just generally boring. \n\nI didn\u2019t like the way she was talking, so I said she has to invite them too, if she\u2019s inviting literally every other girl in class. She got upset and said I was being unfair, because it\u2019s her birthday and it\u2019s supposed to be for her. \n\nThought I\u2019d ask for a second opinion.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add- I\u2019ve met a few of my daughter\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d, and they are weirdly competitive and judgmental. I feel like my daughter has changed a lot since middle school began, and I don\u2019t know how much is because she\u2019s growing into a new phase of life, and how much is because of the other people she spends time with. So yes, it\u2019s valid to not like someone because you just don\u2019t have much in common, but I don\u2019t think this is why her class doesn\u2019t like these kids.

Middle schoolers being what they are, if the 2 girls come under a forced invitation to a laser tag place, and are disliked by the rest of the class, you are setting them up to possibly be bullied and ganged up on. Your daughter won't keep it to herself that you are making her invite them. \n\nI can give no judgment, but would advise going back to the 10-15 closer friends rather than a class wide invite if you are going to make her invite the 2 girls.", "YTA and this is coming from someone who was one of those \"weird girls\" people didn't want to invite. \n\nI was very much into reading, listened to rock music and - which probably was worst - did not give a fuck about the latest trends, fashion and celebreties. I also did not like \"cool\" activities (my youth was way before lasertag became a thing but think bowling and stuff) since it usually inculded a lot of team building and social interactions. I just had very little in common with most girls my age.\n\nWhat I hated much more than being excluded was receiving a \"teachable moment\" invite. I could 100% tell if people had to invite me because their parents wanted to teach them a lesson. And I hated it. If I declined it would cause issues (because sometimes parents would suspect their kids telling me to decline etc.) but if I went I would feel that nobody really wanted me there in the first place every minute. \n\nTeach your daughter about being inclusive and open-minded and all that but do not simply use people as a \"case study\" or \"punishment\". It's just as bad as forcing misbehaved teens to help in a soup kitchen to teach them a lesson by using the homeless. \n\nThose girls will feel that they are not welcome even if your daughter + friends are polite on the surface.", "Having been one of the kids no one liked who got pity invites and at the time didn't realize they were pity invites, I'm going with YTA.\n\nI get what you're trying to do. But you can't force your daughter to like kids she doesn't like and if you make her invite them and they show up, you're setting those kids up for being ignored at best and picked on at worst.\n\nI got those invites as a kid. My mom, ever the optimist, told me to go and have fun, spend time with the kids and make friends. So I'd go. Sometimes I'd just be ignored and have to watch all the kids having fun together while being very obviously and deliberately excluded. Once I was at a kid's house, being ignored, and went looking for a book to read to pass the time. I found instead a story they wrote about how much they and everybody in class hated me and were so glad I was sent away for whatever villainous thing they had me do in the story.\n\nBy middle school, I realized the pity invites were pity invites and stopped going when I got them. But I haven't forgotten the ones I got and went to as an elementary school kid.", "This is tough for me.  \n\nYou are trying to be a good parent and teach her not to be mean. \n\nAT the same time, sometimes, you just don't like some people.  Think about your workplace, I'd bet that there are some people who have never wronged you, but you don't particularly like either.  Sometimes its hard to even put into words what you don't like. Her reasons aren't great.  At the same time, I'm not a fan of forcing someone to invite people they don't want to invite. \n\nI guess NAH.  I think your heart is in the right place.  But at what point will you let her choose her friends?  \n\nAlso, if none of the other girls like them, is it really good to invite those girls anyway?  LIke, if they come and no one talks to them, is that really better than not being invited?\n\nI used to teach 8th grade, and it is a tough line on where you let people be friends with who they want, without bullying the people they don't like.", "Gentle YTA here. I get what you're trying to do, have the talk with your daughter about how those girls must feel being excluded from everything...that being said forcing her to invite people she doesn't want is a recipe for disaster. Those 2 girls aren't going to feel welcomed at the party, in fact they will probably be teased mercilessly for not being wanted there, or simply exluded from all interactions.\n\nYour heart might be in the right place, but forcing unwanted social intetactions never really works out...for anyone involved.", "NTA. I don't really subscribe to the idea that at this age all kids must be invited, or all girls, or whatnot, but in this case, I think obviously leaving out just one or two is indeed unfair. \n\nI think that if the party was scaled down, to say like 3-5 girls, it would be ok to exclude the rest, as the size and scale of the party would not be at the level of being essentially the whole class. So consider giving your daughter the choice to add those two girls or scale down the party to fewer friends. \n\nI do appreciate this will feel like you're kind of treading on her autonomy but given her explanation for disliking those girls, it seems like she's just kind of subscribing to a group think mentality against these girls for no real reason, and is playing a BIT of a 'mean girl' role for them. This is an important lesson for her.", "If you force her to invite girls her class does not like, then it is on YOU to watch like a hawk and make sure those two girls feel welcome and SAFE. Circulate. Talk to them. Model behavior. Shut down impolite comments or shunning.\n\nThey are now YOUR guests and it's on YOU to host them well.", "This is a bit of a toughie, but I'm gonna go ESH.\n\nShe definitely shouldn't be talking like that about her classmates. But she's 12 and in middle school. It's a rough age and rough school. Hopefully, she'll grow out of that.\n\nYou though, are basically forcing her into this when she doesn't want to. She should be allowed to invite who she wants and doesn't want to her party, as she's growing up. Also, if those girls did come, when they're not wanted, they will probably be tormented by your daughter and/or her friends. Your heart is in the right place, but it's not gonna work the way you think it will.", "Of course YTA. Do you really think that by inviting these girls your daughter is suddenly going to like them? Not everyone likes everybody else, same goes for kids.", "You seem to think there are only two options: invite the two outcasts, or don\u2019t. The problem with both options is that is those two girls feel left out.  The way those two girls are treated is wrong. \n\nThe teachable moment should be, it\u2019s not ok to include **almost everyone** in an activity. \n\nThe better choices are to invite less than half, or cheerfully invite and include all. \n\nYTA", "yes YTA  a caring one but still a low key AH on this \n\nat 9 my daughter gets to choose who she engages with outside of school including at her parties.   there are kids she likes and kids she doesnt like so she isnt forced to interact with kids she doesnt like. \n\nyour daughte is developing her own personality and desires and whilst it may seem \"unfair\" quite honestly that is life and everyone needs to learn that lesson from time to time.", "YTA that\u2019s a little old to invite everyone", "Daughter is obviously insecure and anxious about losing her own social status. Help her learn social status doesn\u2019t matter if you know you are living in the body of a mean girl.", "Speaking as someone forced to *go* to a party I didn't want to....I went home crying....\n\nSpeaking as someone forced to *invite* someone I didn't want to for something....I left crying, because of them... and that was my wedding. \n\nI can't pass judgement here because your heart is in the right place.... but this could be a monumentally bad idea....", "I don't support inclusion bullshit. I won't make my kid hang out with anyone they don't like for whatever reason they may have. My ONE rule is not to be unkind. She's allowed to have her friends and chose whom not to befriend but if I find out she's been unkind to anyone then it's different. \n\nIt's ok to politely say \"I would prefer not to hang out with you\" without giving a reason and without being unkind. As adults we practice this often. At 12 she's old enough to understand. YTA.  She should be able to choose who she wants at the party.\n\nExclusion isn't bullying; it's simply choosing your friend group and even 12yo kids need to learn that not everyone will like them. I'm not going to entertain responding to close minded individuals. If an adult can chose to exclude, so can children. It's not abuse or bullying at all. \n\nAnd she's 12; of course she's gonna pick her friends for stupid reasons. You think a 12yo chose friends because of their credit score? Loyalty? Etc. No she cares about 12yo crap, like fashion and how \"cool\" someone is.", "Soft YTA it her birthday even if you pay for it (do anyone except 12 years old to pay for her own birthday party ). You heart is in right place but invite everyone not gonna help them. If you daughter and her friends don't want to do anything with these two girls what you going to do? What they will feel after get invited to birthday party but no one talk to them.", "Info: what do you actually hope this does?\nBy forcing your daughter to invite people she doesn\u2019t like(who probably don\u2019t like her) what do you think is going to happen? \n\nDo you imagine some after school special where they bond and become friends?\n\nDo you realize you are inviting them to feel outcast in a different venue? \n\nOr do you plan o forcing them to socialize at the party too? Is that how you plan to celebrate your kid making sure she includes people she doesn\u2019t like at an event she didn\u2019t want to include them in?\n\n YTA  because this makes no sense.", "OP be for real, do you really think forcing your daughter to invite two girls she doesn't like will be good? At best the two will be ignored through the entire party, at worse they'll receive snark remarks from the other girls there. You can't force your daughter and her friends to like those girls and if you keep trying to force the subject you'll only manage to make them resent the girls more.\n\nYour heart is in the right place, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I think other ideas from this thread like scaling down the number of invites would be much better than this. Soft YTA", "YTA - And most probably a hypocrite too.\n\n**You** get to decide who accompanies you on your birthday. She should have that same freedom you give yourself.", "ESH. Your daughter sucks for excluding 2 people and being rude purely due to fashion sense. But you suck because her birthday is not the time or place to force this on her. Talk to her about trying to be nice, trying to find things in common. Someone doesn't need to be mean to you for you not to get on, you may just have nothing in common, but calling them boring and insulting their style was rude and she should be taught that that's rude.", ">She said no one really likes them. This bothered me so I pressed her, asking if they\u2019ve ever been unkind to her. She said no, but they have no fashion sense and they\u2019re just generally boring. \n\nOuch. This is what I think they call a teachable moment.\n\nNTA. She can invite her close friends or the whole class. \n\nObviously my opinion would be different if these girls were bullying her, but leaving them out for something like is just mean. She probably won't even notice whether they're there or not.\n\nETA: lots of people disagree with me, and that's fine. My perspective is that of a socially awkward ND adult with socially awkward ND kids. We obviously have different experiences.\n\nETA (2): a teachable moment doesn't mean *force your kid to invite these unwanted classmates or you'll cancel the party*. It means that this is a great opportunity to talk about bullying and marginalising other kids, and about judging people on their appearance and on their clothes.\n\nI also did *not* say that the 2 girls *must* be invited. I said \"close friends or the whole class\". My assumption is that OP would discuss these 2 options with their daughter, and make that decision together. That would involve (for example) discussing the fact that it would be cruel and inappropriate to tell the other kids that these 2 were a \"pity invite\", that inviting them if they were likely to be ignored or bullied at the party wasn't a great idea and that it would be better to have a friends-only party in that case.", "YTA \n\nThis is HER birthday, she can choose her guest it's her right.. \n\nInviting these girls would not be a good idea, they will be there just because it is your choice so they could be excluded by the other girls and your daughter.", "NTA, i genuinely think you should encourage your daughter to be more kinder to them, especially when she said they haven't even bothered her one bit. Don't most classrooms and schools have a policy for this anyways?\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t work then go to 15 - 10 as initially planned", "YTA. A forced invite/pity invite is NEVER good. I was a floater when I was her age, I was never in one circle, but multiple like athletes, popular crowd etc. (I\u2019m a retired swimmer and dancer).\n\nYou\u2019re basically setting the 2 girls up for failure, especially since the whole grade doesn\u2019t like them/they\u2019re boring (allegedly, kids are unreliable narrators at best). Not to mention, you\u2019re setting your daughter up to fail too. You can\u2019t force your daughter to like them, and forcing her to invite them is a recipe for resentment and disaster. At best, those 2 girls will be ignored by everyone. It\u2019s been a long hot minute since I\u2019ve been in middle school, but I do know kids have gotten a lot more vicious than in years past. At worst, it could be very bad in terms of bullying. \n\nYou\u2019d be better off limiting it to 15 close friends and calling it a day.", "Hmmm \u2026 this is a tough one. Middle school is tough for kids. Your daughter needs to be allowed to pick her own friends however she also needs to learn her actions have consequences. How would she feel if she was not liked because her clothing choices? Or if she was the only girl not invited to a girls party?\n\nAs a Mom of 4 (2 boys, 2 girls) I think I would say just pick 3 close friends. (Odd number of girls often doesn\u2019t work out). There\u2019s no point in including kids that will just be ignored or outcast at the party.\n\nNTA", "Yta.  It doesn\u2019t sound like a bullying situation just that your daughter doesn\u2019t have much in common with those girls.  You aren\u2019t doing any favors for these girls by forcing them into a social situation where they aren\u2019t wanted.  You can\u2019t force kids to be friends.

I totally get why and your heart is in a good place but it\u2019s gonna suck for the 2 girls who were force invited.\n\nBut make this a teachable moment. You\u2019re allowed to not like people, it happens. But for the shallow reasons your daughter listed? I hope she\u2019s aware that those tables can turn at anytime and she may be on the receiving end of that hurt one day. Middle school is brutal and crap can change on a dime. Learning to be kind in general and open minded towards others goes a long way, even in adulthood.", "Don't force a Pity Invite!!! Seriously, she is allowed to not like someone. But I would also ask her if there is a specific reason these girls are being singled out.

She shouldn't have to invite someone who she dislikes for whatever reason.\n\nIf you are concerned on the type of treatment these girls are getting from your daughter and the rest of the class that's valid, but it shouldn't be addressed at your daughter's birthday party.", "[deleted]", "Was leaning toward Y.  T. A since she\u2019s 12.\nThat\u2019s an age where they can pick their own friends etc.\nBUT all but TWO girls in a classroom?!

What will that experience be like for those two girls? For your daughter? Your daughter already doesn't like them, now she will have reason for even more resentment. If these girls are considered by all her friends to be low in the social hierarchy, she'll feel she needs to defend why she invited them, and will tell all her friends she *had* to invite them. This will get back to those two girls. If they don't already know they aren't *really* wanted at the party, they will soon. Perhaps not until they are at the party, which will likely set them up for humiliation. Consider their point of view - would you rather be simply not invited to a party someone who isn't a friend is throwing? Or would you rather be \"invited\" and show up somewhere you aren't really wanted? You're an adult, if you found yourself in such a situation you could leave, these girls will likely be stuck. This is the kind of thing that can lodge deep in your memory and psyche for a long time. \n\nAnd your daughter? She will go into her birthday party, not enjoying her time with her friends, but likely engaging in talking about these girls behind their backs, to make sure all her friends know that *they* aren't her friends. She'll likely end up in a position where she's on some spectrum of bullying or allowing bullying around her. It'll be a negative experience for everyone involved. And your daughter will not trust you with friendship issues going forward after you force your will on her social interactions, and you'll likely just start hearing less about them - reducing your ability to positively impact her going forward. \n\nYou want to teach your daughter to look beyond the surface level and be more kind and inclusive to her peers. That's admirable - a forced invite at her birthday is not the way to do it. \n\nYTA if you follow this plan.", "Going with a soft YTA. Your daughter is starting the teenage years.

Instead I think I would really sit down with my daughter and have a conversation about inclusiveness and not being a mean girl etc.  I would tell her what I think was the right choice but ultimately leave it in her hands.

Have a conversation with her about bullying sometime in the future (in the future, so that it isn't connected with her party). Work on her empathy skills.

And if so, how did your daughter react?", "I agree. As the outcast kid, parties were absolute hell for me growing up. Mum would make me go and I'd just end up sitting out at the side, watching everyone else because none of the adults would make the other kids play with me. I wasn't mean or anything, I was just never accepted in that school. I was five when I moved there and the other little girls told me I couldn't play with them because I had a willy. No one did anything about this exclusion and it just got worse and worse from there. The king and Queen bees controlled my peers, it was honestly really crazy. I had a lot of friends in my old school. Anyone who tried to be my friend in the new one, up until I left that town, were bullied so badly they'd ditch me. I don't blame them. Best part, I moved away and made friends pretty quickly at uni. \n\nSo yeah, don't force the invite. It just hurts. Either way it's going to suck. I don't know which is worse tbh. Not getting the invite or spending an entire party being ignored or ganged up on with other adults looking on and not caring.", "Say it with me:  \"They're all going to laugh at you!\"", "I\u2019m glad this is the top comment. Chances are these two girls are already picked on enough and definitely do not want to be at op\u2019s daughter\u2019s birthday party. But if you invite them and their parents are on the same \u2018everyone love each other\u2019 wavelength they\u2019ll force them to go and\u2026 it won\u2019t end well. \n\nIn a perfect world there would be no bullying and no exclusion, and I definitely think that\u2019s the right thing to encourage. But instead of forcing your daughter to invite these girls that will most definitely be miserable if they end up going, sit down with her and listen to her talk about *why* her and her friends don\u2019t like these girls. Gently point out the flaws in her reasoning. (\u201cThey dress weird\u201d \u201cwhy do you think they dress weird?\u201d/\u201cother people probably think you dress weird as well\u201d) \n\nI was definitely an outcast kid in middle school and I can tell you with 100% certainty I was never bothered when I wasn\u2019t invited to a popular girl party. I didn\u2019t want to be there. I didn\u2019t like the girls and they didn\u2019t like me, I didn\u2019t care that I wasn\u2019t involved in their stuff and I definitely didn\u2019t want them involved in mine. These things just happen, the best you can do is make sure your daughter isn\u2019t outright bullying them. But she is definitely at an age where she is going to pick and choose who her friends are", "Yeah. This may backfire very badly.", "I was the girl that didn't get invited and I was perfectly fine with it. I didn't like the \"other girls\" any more than they liked me. There were times that I was invited and I passed and spent the time with my actual friends and was much happier for it.", "This happened to me, I think. Not completely sure, but after the switch from primary to secondary school, my BF(F) and I had several arguments that lead to me not being friends with her anymore. I was still invited to her birthday party in 6th grade though. \n\nFor some reason, these head massagers that kinda look like a deranged whisk were popular back then. I hate them, I don't like the feeling at all. Well, the other girls held me down and she forced that thing upon my head. \"See, it's not so bad.\" Well, no. But I still don't like it. I waited till the attention shifted elsewhere, excused myself to go to the bathroom and called my mom to pick me up. Not sure if there were ever any consequences, I told her mom what happened though. Never got an excuse.", "This was also my first though. Being a pity/forced invite to a middle school party by a parent essentially sets up a perfect opportunity for bullying. It creates a sense of resentment and a social environment where it is easier to be mean. \n\nOP is totally right that her daughter is not right for thinking her daughter's attitude needs to be fixed. It's just not worth risking the happiness of two girls to enforce kindness on your daughter's behalf.", "That's a good point. It's bound to be an issue to some degree in any birthday party format, but it'll be worse if it's a laser tag party and people are running around shooting each other. Being excluded sucks, but being invited and then bullied is worse.", "I think this is a no win situation for OP. If she invites the two girl this can happen and even if they are not bullied OP's kid will definitely say she was forced to invite them. \nIf she doesn't she allows her kid to engage in this \"we don't like you because you are not cool\"\n\nPersonally, I would not invite them but would enroll my kid in volunteering that increased her sense of empathy. Underprivileged children, etc, a Sport club in a less privileged area or with a different socio-economic set up", "This is the way. Invite less than half the class or everyone. Yeah, it sucks to cull your invites but it's a rule of thumb that works somewhat well.\n\nIt's a horrible situation for the bullied kids, but it is temporary. Eleven and twelve year old girls are the worst. By the time they reach high school age things tend to sort themselves out and they start to pull back from their behavior. By the time you are in adulthood the bullies are coming up to and reminiscing about all the great times you shared in school, completely forgetting they excluded you from everything.", "your daughter will make sure everyone knows it's a forced invite and then the inevitable \"no one likes you, you're only here because her mom made her\" it's setting things up for cruelty", "This is the correct answer, but I also think OP needs to sit down and talk to their daughter about bullying and not judging people based on something as insignificant as fashion sense. People are more than what they wear, and if clothes is the only reason to dislike them, that's an issue that should be nipped in the bud", "YTA (although I hate saying OP is an AH because she\u2019s not). I\u2019ve been the girl invited because the mom made her and it didn\u2019t feel good. At 6th grade, I think it\u2019s okay to start not inviting everyone in the class especially if it\u2019s middle school and they\u2019re going to multiple classes.", "Feeling like you\u2019re in a place you aren\u2019t welcome/don\u2019t belong even as an adult is draining. it\u2019s so traumatizing to force the kids through that.", "Yes, my daughter was also one of the weird girls and she hated being the pet project so others could feel better about themselves. And thats not to say she didn\u2019t ever feel bad not being included in things, but the pitying was much worse.", "This is the best explanation I think. Don't use another child to teach your child a lesson.", "Soft YTA.\n\nTeach your daughter not to be a raging asshole to other people, but don't force her to invite people who aren't her friends to her birthday party.", "Being used as a therapy tool for other kids when you\u2019re still a kid sucks so much. You\u2019re well behaved and want to pay attention but here, be sat with all the kids who aren\u2019t doing as well so you can be a \u201cgood influence.\u201d", "Maybe have another event that involves all the girls. Organize with a spread of parents/guardians to host a neutral event can handle multiple activities and mixing of people (eg., holiday party). \n\nNo one is single focus or decision maker and a more fun way for them to interact. Popular or not, some will like things like cookie decorating, pumpkin carving, etc). \n\nEssentially, you want to foster an environment for them to develop relationships and humanize each other. Won\u2019t cure them all from being not-so-great but a good step.", "I was one of the outcast kids, too. \"Boring\" to the other girls and no \"fashion sense\". I also got pity invites I did not realize were pity invites. My mom insisted I go and try to become better friends with the rest of the girls in my class. It was always made (often painfully) clear I was not wanted and was only invited because the birthday girl was \"required\" to. Often, the party was full of people who bullied me day in and day out. \n\nOP, I think you are coming from a good place, so my judgement is a very gentle YTA. I don't think requiring your daughter to invite these girls would be the good deed/positive learning experience you think it would be. There are times for lessons of inclusion, but maybe a laser tag birthday party is not one.\n\nPerhaps talk to your daughter and her teacher to find out more about the dynamic in the class and make sure your daughter is not being cruel to these 2 girls. Sometimes, people just don't have enough things in common to be friends. So long as no bullying is happening, that is just fine.", "As another of the kids nobody invited... I hear you. \n\nOP, YTA even though you mean well. Inviting those kids to make yourself feel good is not doing them any favors. Either they decline because they realize the birthday girl was forced to invite them, or - worse - they show up at the party and get bullied. Middle school is rough.", "Fourth grade flashback. I was at the lunch table and the class bitch was going on and on about how \u201ceveryone\u201d was going to be at her birthday party.

Did you give them out yesterday?\u201d\n\nLittle while later, I get the invite. \n\nDay of the party, I\u2019m there and I ask where one of the other girls was. Class Bitch goes, \u201cSome people know better than to ask for invitations to things they\u2019re not wanted at.\u201d\n\n35 years later, I remember that cut.

I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that & hope you found good people in your life!", "Unfortunately, kids can be really horrible to each other. Sorry they did that to you.", "This is heartbreaking. I am so sorry you went through this.", "having been one of two girls not invited to a class-wide birthday party - that shit SUCKED.   \nthat said, a forced invite is not the way - it kind of seems like your daughter is leaning into mean-girl territory (not as a bully, but as that way of thinking). forcing the invite wont help, inviting everyone barr 2 girls wont help, but it might be time to getting thru to your daughter and seeing if you can foster some more compassion/empathy. this birthday party is not the moment for that tho, so ESH", "These girls are going to be hurt either way. They don't get the invite, they'll be taunted and remember. They do, they'll be bullied and remember. It's really not fair, but you learn that early on when you're the outcast. They already know they are so I see no reason to invite them and subject them to the bullying that would come along. \n\nThe mean girl thing needs to stop. Now.", "but if at work you were having a party you would not invite everyone except those couple of people, you would hope they didn't come but you wouldn't exclude them.", "As one of these excluded types, you and everyone else knows a pity invite when you see one.

I had a small group of girls I hung out with. Two of them were frenemies and bullied me (they were part of my group and the popular girl group). One of these frenemies pressured a 14-year-old boy to ask me to dance. My first response was, \"Is this a joke?\" because... Well, one part of bullying is setting someone up for humiliation, even if it seems like inclusion. It was awkward and I hated it, he hated it, and the frenemy was just setting me up to knock me down, based on the shit she said to me afterward (\"See, someone will dance with you even when you look like that!\" kind of crap.)\n\nSo many of the comments in here seem to not realize just how fucking mean a tween girl can be, and how covert the bullying is. It's not beating each other up and calling each other names. It's backhanded \"compliments\"; it's rumours, gossip, lies; it's blackmail and judgement; it's pretending to be your friend only to get your secrets to share with everyone else who doesn't like you. The Mean Girls movie was not a parody, in my eyes.", "It\u2019s a tricky situation, as it also doesn\u2019t feel good to be the unwanted guest. You can feel it. It\u2019s valid to not be friends with everyone. Different personalities, different interests, whatever it is. Some people just won\u2019t vibe together. While your daughter\u2019s reasons are shallow, that\u2019s where she\u2019s at. Those other girls might not want anything to do with her because they might see her as shallow and more consumed with appearance than they are. \n\nI would, however, challenge your daughter to break down why she\u2019s inviting each girl she is individually. Is she actually friends with them, or is she trying to raise her social status? What\u2019s the point? Is it bragging rights? Get to the intention. Get to know who your daughter actually is. \n\nWe don\u2019t need to rescue the nerdy outcast kids. This can actually cause more backfire sticking them in a pity invite with a group of kids who are annoyed and/or resentful that they\u2019re present. I can see where you\u2019re coming from OP. But rather than checking in with your daughter about who she is, you\u2019re sticking a bandaid on her, hoping to hide her flaws, and also yours by association of raising her.", "To also add to the point that the only reasons it seems she doesnt like them is they have no \"fashion sense\" & are \"boring\". Which is totally veering towards mean girl territory.\n\nId understand if the girls were mean & cruel. But i dont get that from this. Its just middle school girls being mean for the sake of being mean.\n\nBut inviting literally every girl in the class minus these 2 is very cruel. I really hope this girl grows out of this & learns & becomes a better person", "And what's forcing her daughter to invite them going to do other than cause resentment?

Maybe have her hand out the invitations after school, not in class. That way the two girls don't feel even more left out?\n\nThis is really a tough one OP. Could you encourage your daughter to talk to them? Maybe the two girls families don't have a lot of money, so they cannot be \"into fashon\" or maybe they don't know how to style?

There was a girl in my class, not sure what exactly the issue was she was with her she was super nice and all but just very rambunctious and often had to be manged my the teacher because she would just wander off. So it'd my birthday and I am taking invitations to school and I told my mom previously I wasn't inviting Angela. She made me invite her so I did. Angela acted up at the party, nothing major just being herself and my mom was calming her down. I blurted out to everyone there \"THIS is why I didn't want to invite you!!\" I was 6 and I made sire everyone knew Angela was a forced invite. Obviously that was horrible of me but forcing your kids into situations will only backfire on you later. Find a better way to teach her kindness while respecting her choices. She can also maybe just give out the invitations outside school and then at least the girls weren't directly singled out in front of the whole class.", "When I was in grade school there was a girl named Andrea who transferred to my school in 7th grade. She was bullied at her old school and honestly was not really likable. She had a chance at a fresh start but nobody really became friends with her because of her \u201cI\u2019m better than you attitude\u201d. She transferred with a group of like 3 other guys who all came from the same school and were bullied.\n\nWell of course she didn\u2019t make any friends and would brag that her parents pay her $100 every time she goes to a school dance and pay her $50 every time she hangs out with a friend. \u201cI thought she didn\u2019t have friends\u201d\u2026 well, there was a girl in my class named Bridget and Bridget\u2019s mom forced her to hang out with Andrea and be Andrea\u2019s friend. Bridget hated it, and it included forced birthday invites and all that.\n\nWell the last day of 8th grade came and when we were dismissed we headed to the parking lot where we always got picked up. Everybody was being all emotional about going to different high schools next year.\n\nI can\u2019t remember if Andrea walked up to Bridget or if it was the other way around but Bridget said something like \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, my mom forced me to hang out with you and I can\u2019t stand you!\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, Andrea\u2019s dad was walking up to take her back to the car.

They had fun and no one was bullied.", "Remember that the invitation is not compulsory. People have the option to refuse.\n\nThe daughter, however, very much does NOT have the option to act like a meangirl and get carte blanche from parents worth their salt. She can either invite everyone, or a few friends, but inviting everyone EXCEPT certain people, is malicious and she needs to be broken of that. If the daughter does indeed poison the well, then she needs to be grounded so she can be reminded how rejection feels and what she is inflicting on people.\n\nIf my tone sounds a bit combative, I apologise. I was often the kid not being invited -- for which I do not blame my classmates at the time, to be clear -- as I was an autistic kid in a world of normies, in a time before parents or teachers knew what autism was. Always picked last in sport, always sidelined, and honestly I feel that to this day.", "because it always works in films...", "This.

Sleepovers at each other\u2019s homes, getting off at each other\u2019s bus stops throughout the week to play. She would even come with me sometimes to my weekend visits with my mom.\n\nThen we started sixth grade at a new school; the middle school where all the area elementary schools mesh into one. The first day of school, on the bus ride home, I was talking to my \u201cbest friend\u201d when one of the more popular girls asked her \u201care you friends with her?\u201d She then does the \u201cso so\u201d movement with her hand.

He was polite. The chubby boy actually made a couple of new friends.\n\nWhy are we assuming OP's daughter's party is going to turn into the prom from Carrie?", "That was my first thought.

I was gutted, but too proud to say anything. \n\n\nSomeone told me once that I gave off an air of not being interested in going to parties, but Idk. It's a chicken and an egg type deal. I didn't get invited, so I tried not to care. So then I didn't get invited.", "That\u2019s a pretty good advice.\n\nNot only the parent will know better about all the friends and colleagues of the child, but is a good way to start conversation and try to guide against peer pressure and any bullying speech.", "Yeah, my daughter was friends with a group since elementary. At some point, I noticed they were excluding her, but when I asked her about it, she said she no longer wanted to be invited because they're mean girls and just talked about other girls the last couple of times she got together with them.

She has time to learn and grow and deal with these things in a better manner.", "I'd be more inclined to reduce the total number of invites, rather than add these pity invites.

But part of this is not just sending an invite to these girls only to ridicule and exclude them later, it is to actually include them. If OP's daughter doesn't think she can do that, she should scale down her party. \n\nYes, at 12 she isn't the most moral, but that's why parenting and lessons at this point are important. Just letting her continue being immoral and unkind, unchecked, is not really a recipe for her to grow in the way she needs to.", "Well-intended solution but likely ineffectual. The girls will find out about the party whether invites are circulated DURING school or not. What it appears to come down to is that these girls are being unfairly ostracized.

Often, the very adults doing the forcing, absolutely would not invite a casual coworker whom they didn\u2019t care for at all to their own private party. I\u2019ve had kids on both sides of this situation. If my kid is being excluded in a group, I help them find and nurture a different group of friends with whom they have more in common. If my kid doesn\u2019t want to invite everyone in a group to an event, she doesn\u2019t have to. We don\u2019t owe that to some acquaintance. \n\nOnce, a group leader made a huge deal about my daughter \u201cinviting every girl but one to her party\u201d.

Did you want to hurt someone to make it stop? What if you couldn't afford clothes and people made fun of you for it? Once they have an experience to establish how mocking hurts, it's easier each time to just take a second and think about how you'd feel if that was you.

You can tell by the comments of the daughter.", "If you invite those two girls everyone will ignore them\nthere, at BEST and it won\u2019t be pleasant.\n\nEmpathy is KNOWING kids are cruel, and giving a pity invite hurts everyone.", "I would have thought it was a joke or prank if I got  invited to a popular kids birthday in middle school. Elementary, yeah. The whole class is usually invited, if I remember right. \n\nI was such a weirdo kid, though, so I didn't get invited places very often anyhow. \n\nThere doesn't seem to be an easy answer to this. I wonder if the two excluded girls are friends. That would maybe be something that would factor in. \n\nMy weird friend and I knew we weren't invited to popular kid places, and it hurt but was honestly easier to navigate with a friend whether the invite was a pity one, a prank one, a healing-lets-be-friends one, a forced one. Should I go and pretend I belong? Should I go and act like I don't care? Should I give my regrets and potentially miss out on something pretty cool? These are hard questions for adults, let alone children who are basically still brand new to this world.\n\nEdit to add my \"solution\", but forewarning I don't have kids! \n\n1. OP can reach out to the parents of the kids excluded and see if they can discuss the situation. For all we know, these two girls are like my friends and I. We knew where we stood in social ranking, and were overall okay with that as long as we had each other. Perhaps these girls are fine not being invited, and have something else planned anyhow, they're going to the amusement park. \n\n2. If they desperately want to be invited, plan a getaway for them with their parents if things get too weird or rough. An emergency phone call from home has helped me in a pinch before! \ud83d\ude05 Sorry, gotta go. Mom's freaking out about my homework. OP can check in on them and ask if they need a quick getaway. \n\n3. Talk to birthday girl and give her some tips for getting out of situations where bullying might be happening, but where she can feel safe, too. Middle school girls are mean, and they feed on each other. Help her find graceful ways out that won't make the squad turn on her, but will give her something to help later, even she bombs this time. \n\n4. Find activities that are group ones. One of my favorites is putting everyone on two sides to start. Pants v shorts, straight hair v curly, etc. Then ask questions like \"waffles or pancakes\" \"drinking only chocolate milk forever or drinking only water forever\". Everyone goes to which side they like most! Games like this don't force anyone to talk, and can help to get convos going with other people. It's doesn't work every time, but I haven't seen it *hurt* yet.\n\nOmg you could give out prizes, too. The second part of the game can be where one person gets in the circle and people have to guess what answer they would choose. Candy or money given out to kids who guess right. That way it's a neutral way of talking to and about the excluded girls which takes the pressure off being a middle schooler, but everyone gets to feel included. The prizes need to be worth it to speak up and guess about the \"nerdy\" girls. \n\nDon't hold yourself to too high of expectations. You could plan and plan and talk and talk and this could still be a disaster. BUT it won't be the worst lesson for everyone involved, and next birthday you can level up with all the new things everyone learned, and your daughter will have an example of where being kind is ultimately always worth it.", "But the kids don\u2019t have to go just because they\u2019re invited.", "Actually, as someone who was the forced invite kid you're going to worsen the isolation because nothing sucks more than being stuck at an event where you weren't even wanted at by the person the event is being thrown for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if no one SAYS anything to them, kids are astute in picking up subtle signs that they are indeed the odd ones out.", "I never went to a school where everyone liked each other bar 1/2 people (don't get me wrong, there were 1/2 girls no one liked, but then there were 4-7 other groups of friends who only partially overlapped and would not all be invited to the same things), so we never actually had this issue as no one liked more than say, 10 other girls.\n\nBut I would have thought the obvious solution would be to set a limit on numbers that's less than 1/2 the class. It's not leaving one/two people out that way \ud83e\udd37", "Part of the reason why full class invites is a thing in elementary schools mostly is because kids tend to have multiple classes in middle schools.

It's time to step in and TEACH right/wrong, status vs stupid, EMPATHY, that everyone has some stupid ' reason ' they'll be better/worse than someone else and it's terrific to knock this in the dam head hard and NOW.\n\nI'd be damned if I watched 2 kids bullied and watch because it would apparently make it 'harder'. Over my proverbial dead body. Those kids are included gracefully, are treated with grace or there's no party.", "I don\u2019t think anyone was talking about having her volunteer somewhere? I think the suggestion was more to go outside the immediate demographic of that classroom and sign her up for some other kind of activity, where she would be exposed to different walks of life. \n\nThat could be anything from Girl Scouts to a sports club to a theater group \u2014 just something where her daughter meets and interacts with other people outside of her little \u201cmean girl\u201d school crowd. \n\nI would like to add that it would be a good idea to sign the daughter up for something that she is not naturally gifted at. She doesn\u2019t need an activity where she will outshine anybody. She needs an activity that she has to work at and be on the low rung of the totem pole for a bit.", "You're absolutely correct!", "What\u2019s a better term than underprivileged ?", "Only that if you pass the invites out at school, it must be universal. You can do whatever the fuck you want on your private time and private means of communication. You couldn't say, use the Class WhatsApp group to send out invites, or those class online forums/Blackboard type things. \n\nBut if you want to invite only Susie and Brynleigh and Kaiden and Jessica, you are free to send them invites, or their parents via email, text etc.", "Eh, I dunno. My daughters went to schools that are fairly rural, so everyone basically knew everyone else and was always up in everyone's business.\n\nMy daughter was definitely a social butterfly and one of the cool kids, so she did end up socializing with almost every single one of her classmates. Because of who she was (popular, cheerleader, student council, etc), the minute we caught any whiff of Mean Girls behavior, we shut that shit down because I wasn't about to let her bully anyone else.\n\nShe was allowed to invite whomever she wanted to her birthdays...but she knew that she'd better have a pretty damn good reason if she was going to exclude someone for some reason. She's turned out okay, so I think we did a decent job of teaching her to be kind.", "Yeah I feel like the daughter is leaving that out.
