I mean, her kids are such good friends and I wish I had that with them but I don't. Her husband's parents are so nice to me and they love that I can speak Chinese since their grandkids can't. I wish her husband could've been my dad with how he treats me.

I hope you can seek some professional help to guide you through your grief and sort out your feelings towards your mom. You said what you felt, and I absolutely do not fault you for that.  \n\nYour mom should\u2019ve been more present in your life the past twelve years.

Should you have blown up like that? No probably not, but your emotions have got to be tough to handle right now. You regret it, but you need to tell your Mom that, not us here on Reddit. \n\nListen to what she was confiding in your step Dad, she needs you to be happy. She can't change the past, as I'm sure she would love to, and neither can you. What you can do is be honest and open with her and build your relationship from here. She has taken you in now, she wants a better life for you and is trying to provide it. Parents are humans too, they can (and often do) make mistakes. I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings either here, you are allowed to feel how you do. I don't think keeping those feelings bottled up and then blowing up as you did is the best way forward. Try to be a little more receptive to the love she is giving you now, be honest with her about how you're feeling, and give her a hug it seems like you both could use it. \n\nBest of luck friend.", "NTA your mom didn't want to deal with your dad so she left you behind, having only minimal contact with you. She then went on to live a better life and have more children that you were excluded from until your father died. Your mom owes you the truth and a massive apology. The fault lies with mom not with you. You won't have a real relationship with her until she comes clean.\n\nEdit: sentence errors", "...NTA I do think that what you said was a bit out of pocket, however it did seem to be an emotional display of how you truly feel.

Your choice though.", "NTA \n\nShe sacrificed her relationship with you so she wouldn't have to deal with your dad.

But if you think you have a good thing here, don't blow it up before attempting to repair it.\n\nI would apologize to your mom for yelling, but say that you have a lot deep hurt from her decisions and ask why she didn't take you with her or fight for you later. The answer might help put things to rest.", "NTA. Sure, exploding isn\u2019t an ideal way of communicating. But you\u2019ve got a lot of justifiable anger and pain from your mom abandoning you. She seems to have had her reasons. But the fact of the matter is that she prioritized not interacting with your dad over HER OWN CHILD. That\u2019s fucked up. It seems that she wants to make up for it, which is a positive, but that doesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t hurt deeply by her choices. Can\u2019t undo an entire childhood. \n\nIf you want to try out this relationship, might be worth suggesting family therapy. Getting your feelings out with a neutral referee can help a lot to come to an understanding. But you\u2019re not mean or bad for having these feelings.", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to have your feelings and she probably had a harder time than you imagine and thought she was doing what was best. \n\nYour memories are probably only one side of the situation. \n\nIt sounds like you could benefit from family therapy.", "NAH at all.

You don\u2019t owe her anything at this point but it does sound like you want a stronger relationship/bond with her and the extended family. \n\nIf you are able to I would sit down and talk with her and her husband about seeking therapy- maybe individual first if you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re ready for family therapy with mom and husband and/or kids. OP I wish you so much luck in this journey, and I just hope you give yourself grace- you\u2019re grieving and you\u2019re entire life has been changed upside down, anger is an understandable reaction to that- just don\u2019t let it take over your life.", "NAH\n\nYou've suffered a lot of loss, so I wouldn't hold your actions/feelings against you, but your outburst was unfair to your mother.\n\nIt sounds like she was unable to have custody of you (or to adequately provide for you) when they got divorced, and not that she outright abandoned you.  She probably has a good deal of guilt built up for not being the mother you deserved.\n\nYou're grieving and experiencing some jealousy, but if you can stand back and look at your life today you'll see that a lot of love and opportunity was just dropped in your lap.  Build a happy life on this.", "Nah - A way to rephrase your thinking: literally everyone in your life loved you and wanted you to have the best life possible. You *think* you would have been happier but you don't actually know that. For example, why would you have learned Chinese when the other kids didn't? Maybe talk to your mom again and say that you ARE happy, you just wish you guys could have been together sooner.

You are not wrong for how you feel, in truth, you exposed a perspective your mother either ignored or tried to deny.\n\nA bitter truth is that you seemed to integrate well into your mom's life and family again which kept the deeper trauma from being apparent.  As you are probably much older than any half-siblings, it is accurate to say your mother got to redo having a family and being a mother, this time with more experience and resources.", "YTA for giving into anger, but simply being angry, and being overwhelmed, and wishing things had been different doesn't make you bad. \n\nWe lash out when we are exhausted, physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. It's not a moral failing to be human, but rather the failing is the harm we cause to others as we express our weariness. We grow and learn and mature, and much of that is built on the back of shameful outbursts and little moral mistakes. \n\nYTA for snapping, but that doesn't make you a bad person. You feel bad now, which means you care. You bothered to reflect. You talked about the good things you appreciate, the relationship between other children, the kindness of the husband. \n\nThat sort of regret and shame, from losing your cool and hurting someone else, can be a very powerful motivator to be kinder and more patient moving forward. Harness that, and try to find a way to speak with your mother, clearly and honestly. It sounds like everyone wants to do good here, and that's great. \n\nGood luck.", "NAH. You're not an AH for wanting to have been raised with her in China rather than in Canada with your dad, but there may have been legal reasons she was not allowed to take you with her (such as courts not wanting to remove you from your father and native country) or other reasons (Maybe your father threatened her). I think you 2 need to have a discussion in a calm neutral time where you can discuss your sadness and the 2 of you can discuss how you move forward.", "IDK sounds complex. There is likely more to this story. \n\nI mean YTA kinda for just snapping at her when she was being nice. As for the situation growing up, likely that was complex. Or maybe she did let you down but it seems like now she wants to make it up.", "NTA.\n\nsurely what you told her is wrong, but I don't blame your mother for not bringing you to live with her she just got married and couldn't bring a child right away and making you leave your grandma and dad just to come live with them? you could have said to your dad that you want live with your mom if you're mad for the years you missed the fun I don't see the need of pointing your anger towards your mother", "ESH, but you are not an asshole. You are 17, hormones and whatnot suck, and you are grieving a life that you could have had if she had taken you with her. I'd explain to her that you love her, you are glad to be with her, but you are sad that it didn't happen sooner and felt abandoned when she left. No one can go back in time to undo everything that happened, and it does indeed suck that you weren't brought into this family sooner, but in time you'll be able to forgive her.", "OP YWBTA if you don't apologize and explain that it was your emotions at having missed so much of life with her that's the source of your pain.  Hopefully you and your mother will be able to weather your outburst.  She has already expressed to you that she is happy to have you with her now -- that tells you she would have liked you to be there before.  You don't know what role your father had in her decision to leave and whether he prevented you from leaving with her.  It could be that she had a hard time after leaving your dad and didn't think she could have provided for you then.  Be kind and enjoy your new expanded family and be grateful for the opportunities it provides while using your past experience to guide your life as you grow up.", "Gently, YTA and you should apologise to your mom. Divorces are always difficult and you don't have all the information. You never do as a child. Your mom is taking care of you now and seems to love you and her family is also accepting of you, so it is easy to start daydreaming of \"what it could have been if..\" and ruin what you actually have now by such actions as you did now. On one hand it is understandable - you are in the age where it is difficult to contain such emotions and teenagers often lash out. On the other hand, you should think about how much worse it could have been. Apologise to your mom, sincerely. Open up to her and try to connect.", "You got mad and yelled at her because she told you she was happy to have you with her and she wanted to help you make plans towards your future? \n\nAnd I feel like I am missing something, or you are intentionally leaving it out. Your mom is using a cane to walk at just 37? Sounds like she's had some issues happening... \n\nSo far, absolutely leaning towards YTA.", "NTA\n\nI completely understand.", "Honestly, ESH. You being an AH is completely understandable though. You just lost what was your real parent and grief does a number on people. You also feel a lot of justified resentment towards your biological mother. It doesn't make what you said completely right but it sounds like it may just be the truth in a harsh way.\n\nYour mom is a complete AH for abandoning her child when she did not need to. There may be more to the story than you know but for her to just expect you to be happy with the situation is ridiculous. She's definitely in denial about what she's done.", "I understand how you feel about it but ultimately YTA for blowing up like that. You should've at least had a heart to heart with her to see why she did what she did before assuming and blowing up on her like that.\n\nThere is still time to apologize and have that conversation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's the conversation, the communication, that's going to give you a chance to address the things that make you angry. \n\nJust having open and honest dialogs are part of what makes therapy so successful, even if your therapist is a bagel.

And the gesture doesn't have to heal everything, it just has to start the healing process.", "You\u2019re not a little kid but you\u2019re still her child and your mother probably is looking for a least little sign that she can have a place in your life as opposed to the blanket grand gesture you suggested.", "Physical touch is healing. \n\nhttps://selecthealth.org/blog/2017/08/4-healthy-reasons-to-hug-more\n\nYou would be surprised at what a hug can do. \n\nThink of all the hugs you missed and I'll the hugs you have to come. \n\nThen hug your mom.", "I'm not saying to give her forgiveness - it symbolizes healing. Listen I empathize with your situation, I can't understand it as I didn't live it, but I feel for you. I get it, a hug isn't going to make the last decade just fade away. What it can do is show you are willing to reconcile and move forward. \n\nThe way it sounds, your Mom knows the mistakes she made. I can almost guarantee she carries remorse for her actions (evidenced by her crying). You, continuing to dwell on the past and hold that over her head is not helping anyone in this situation. It's not helping you, it's not helping her, it's not helping your step siblings, nor her new husband. All it's doing is breeding resentment. What you CAN do, is judge your mother by what she is doing NOW. People can change, but people can't change the past. You have to be willing to accept that. It's not going to be easy, and it's going to take a lot of work from you both, but you have an opportunity here - it's up to you what becomes of it.", "I did, you didn\u2019t read it. I don\u2019t give a crap if my comment gets buried. OP saw it and that\u2019s all that matters.", "He never hit anybody *that you are aware of*.\n\nThis sub is very good at telling ex-partners to suck it up and not tell their kids about their relationship or the other parent's abuses, poor character etc, with the wise old saying \"they'll figure it out some day and understand\".\n\nYou DON'T know what went on. You were five.\n\nI'm going to say NTA only because I do understand what it's like to lose a grandparent who basically raised you and your father in such a short time - although I was several years older when it happened to me - and find yourself with someone you resent.\n\nThey don't seem to be demanding an apology, and you're already feeling guilty for lashing out. Everything now depends on what you want going forward. Do you want to be part of her family now you have the chance, or not?\n\nIf you do, you'll HAVE to find a way to deal with these feelings and leave them in the past. They will eat you alive otherwise. Simple as that.", "That is the reason why she split from your father. What wasn't she going to tolerate? It isn't the reason why she isn't with you - why couldn't she get full custody? Why did she see you so rarely? \n\nYou are in a really difficult situation. You are angry about the past - you can try to learn why your mom did what she did and then decide if you can forgive; or you can stay angry without finding any reasoning or answers. My point is that you have to communicate with her, you have to try to find a common ground to talk and to listen to what she has to say.", "You're kidding right?", "Because cancer can mean extended hospital stays, lack of ability to care for a child, a burden on their parents, and possibly death. You're angry so you're looking for an excuse to blame your mom. And maybe she is to blame. But now you're actively trying NOT to forgive her.", "Assuming that she didn't want you. You don't know that. Talk to her about it rather than assuming", "What healing is going on though? It doesn't sound like the mom has made a single apology for abandoning her child or even acted like she did. Healing doesn't happen from pretending harm didn't occur or by paper overing the harm with money.", "Symbolizes healing? This isn't english class. And I don't know if I am willing to reconcile and every time she has hugged me since I moved in just feels weird cause it's like she's a stranger. I don't think she feels remorse, from the way she was talking it felt like she thinks it's my choice I never got to be with her. And judge her by what she's doing now? What is that? I've known her for like three months. She's not the mom from my memories anymore, she doesn't even look like that anymore or act like she used to.", "I don't know why she didn't go for full custody. If she really wanted me, she would have taken my dad to court and gotten it. But she didn't. Probably because she didn't want to see him. Same reason why she hardly ever saw me. I know that she hated him more than she loves me.", "No, I'm not. She get have cancer the moment she left me and lose it the day she took me in.", "But she didn't have it for the entire last twelve years. She was in treatment for one year and I didn't even know until a month before she went into remission because she didn't see me at all or phone me or anything. If it was really bad she would have died and I wouldn't have even known about it because she had nothing to do with me.", "If she wanted me, she could have had me. She could have fought for custody for me. Instead she was just happy with my grandma driving me over every now and then and then barely seeing me. She's got a lot more money than my dad ever did so I know she could have had me.", "I can't fathom the sense of abandonment you feel. Let me be clear; your resentment and disappointment towards the past are completely valid. If you can't get passed those feelings and memories, by all means, do what is best for you. You are right.\n\nAs I said before, you have an opportunity here to fix something that is broken. That's *your* choice though. I am sorry you're going through this, it cannot be easy. Take care of yourself in whatever way works best for you. \n\nI wanted to offer some perspective - and some advice to be a little more receptive to the fact that she is providing for you now. Maybe it is too little too late. You don't owe her anything.\n\nIf you want to get her perspective on things though, you need to talk to her - whenever you're ready. If you ever get to that point. I know you'll succeed dude, you're strong you've been through so much, and you'll get to where you want to be. Best of luck with your studies at UBC, it will get better.", "Like I said talk to her about it rather than holding it in. All that's gonna do is fester emotions and blow up like you did before.", "Except you literally don't know that.  You are assuming that.  Yes, it sounds incredibly shitty and I (and many others it seems) totally understand your anger and bitterness.  However, you should talk to your mom.  Let her know how you feel and why you feel that way, perhaps she can provide information that will help you understand.  Work on building a relationship with her now since you have that chance.  If she cares enough to be crying that hard at what you said she'll care enough to try to explain to you and work with you."]}
