We've been married nearly 15 years and until recently hadn't seen said friend since our wedding. I tried ignoring these comments initially thinking it was similar to the way some guys greet friends but also told my then girlfriend she deserved better friends.\n\nThis friend moved away shortly before my wife and I got married but has recently moved back to our area. I agreed to go to lunch with not only my wife and her friend but also our children. Immediately upon seeing my wife the friend yells out well if it isn't that (nasty w name), (wife's name). This was in front of our children, we do not use kind of language especially around our kids. I spoke out and said that wasn't a nice way to greet someone you're supposed to be friends with and the friend replied by telling my wife she was lucky to have trapped such a nice guy.\n\nI've told my wife that the kids and I will not have anything to do with her friend from now on. She says I just don't understand and that is how her friend is. She says I'm being an AH because if the kids and I won't go she won't be able to find the time to visit with her friend.\n\nTldr wife's \"friend\" calls her names so I refuse to have anything to do with said friend.", "created_utc": 1679932099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123qzkg/aita_for_refusing_to_be_around_my_wifes_friend/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like your wife is so used to this treatment she now doesn't see it for what it is. I also agree the fact she did it in front of your children is completely unacceptable.

Without a doubt you are the asshole and are dismissing the fact these are your wife's kids too and she does not seem to have a problem with them hearing the word whore. It's fair to ask a friend to chill on language in front of kids. It is not fair to be as outwardly judgemental over her affectionate use of a word that isn't even directed at you. \n\nHowever yta the most for thinking you have a right to tell your wife she can't bring her own children along to hang out with this friend. If she was physically abusive or negligent, you might have some grounds for concern, but affectionately using the term whore? Give me a break.", "ESH. You sound incredibly easy to offend and if your wife is OK with what is pretty obviously a joke, no matter how tasteless you find it, you should leave it alone. I do maintain that you can decide not to see friend for any reason, but you and your wife would ideally agree on if the kids can see this friend or not, I don't think the friend's language entitles you to a unilateral decision there. Your wife sucks bc she should ask her friend to turn it down since it offends you, I also don't understand why she can't see her friend without you and the kids in tow. The friend sucks for calling her friend \"Whore\" around her kids, although I guarantee your clutched pearls they are hearing worse elsewhere.", "ESH. Your wife's friend obviously sucks because any grown adult would realize that's not an appropriate thing to say in front of kids.\n\nYour wife sucks because instead of drawing a hard boundary with her friend and telling her friend not to call her that, ESPECIALLY in front of kids, she's letting you be the fall guy. \n\nAnd finally, you. This needed to be put back in your wife's court instead of unilaterally saying you and the kids will have nothing to do with this friend. You should have expressed to your wife that your friend calling her that name in private is one thing if it doesn't bother your wife, but it bothers you (and should bother your wife) that she did it in public and in front of the kids. This is your wife's issue to handle and you should have made your feeling known and let her handle it.", "NTA. Teach your kids to value themselves more than allowing someone to publically deride them.

Why don't you believe your wife on that?", "Your wife is disrespecting you as the man of the house.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is telling you this isn't a bad name, it's being used as a term of endearment, and yet you think you know better than her and know what's best for her. Get over yourself, man. \n\nIt's one thing to request language filters around young kids, it's a completely different thing than to wholly misunderstand two people's friendship to the point that you think it's bad just because you don't like the jokes they have with eachother.\n\nIf your wife had an issue being called a whore in jest (you're too much of a child to even write out the damn word), she would've said something years ago.", "NTA Will your wife be ok with your kids calling her a W?

She's free to leave the kids with me anytime she wants but choses to take them along. Whenever I'm home I go along with the family too.

This same \"friend\" talks down about anyone who didn't move away after high-school/ college and just generally has nothing nice to say about anyone other than herself.  I focused on the whore comment because that's the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. I can quietly deal with negativity but will not stand for insults being thrown in my wife's face.\n\nAs far as your comment about the kids being my wife's also she is bigger on censoring what they see and hear more than I am. This was a \"friend\" she hadn't seen since before having kids she agrees that she would rather not have the kids hear that but had \"hoped (friends name) had matured\"", "I disagree with you calling OP an asshole for this. While yes, it should be on the wife to tell her friend to not talk to her like that, OP was just trying to protect their kids from hearing that woman insult their mother. He's not an asshole for that. \n\nIf anything, not doing what he did and letting the kids hear what this 'friend' calls their mother would be the real asshole move.", "We have rules about language used around the kids. As far as not liking the friend, she never says anything positive about my wife and acts as if she's better than us. An example from the lunch was her saying she hates that her husband's job moved them back closer to home because everyone that didn't move away after high-school never amounted to anything. She kept going on and on about the only successful people are the ones that got out of here. My wife and I chose to stay in the area to be closer to family, but are far from unsuccessful in life.
