We've been married nearly 15 years and until recently hadn't seen said friend since our wedding. I tried ignoring these comments initially thinking it was similar to the way some guys greet friends but also told my then girlfriend she deserved better friends.\n\nThis friend moved away shortly before my wife and I got married but has recently moved back to our area. I agreed to go to lunch with not only my wife and her friend but also our children. Immediately upon seeing my wife the friend yells out well if it isn't that (nasty w name), (wife's name). This was in front of our children, we do not use kind of language especially around our kids. I spoke out and said that wasn't a nice way to greet someone you're supposed to be friends with and the friend replied by telling my wife she was lucky to have trapped such a nice guy.\n\nI've told my wife that the kids and I will not have anything to do with her friend from now on. She says I just don't understand and that is how her friend is. She says I'm being an AH because if the kids and I won't go she won't be able to find the time to visit with her friend.\n\nTldr wife's \"friend\" calls her names so I refuse to have anything to do with said friend.", "created_utc": 1679932099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123qzkg/aita_for_refusing_to_be_around_my_wifes_friend/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have every right not to be near her friend. You can't tell your wife not to hang around the firned, but you are allowed to stay away.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife's friend can be like that when they meet in private. If she can't control herself around your kids, then you are doing exactly the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nNormally, when such language is used towards someone, it's up to that person to decide whether they take offense to it or not. It's fine for your wife to not mind being called that, but it's *not* okay to say such a thing in front of young kids, and it's not okay for her friend to say that your wife trapped you into marriage.\n\nEven if she's your wife's friend, you're under no obligations to be friends with her yourself.", "NTA That's not how friends treat each other. Sounds like your wife is so used to this treatment she now doesn't see it for what it is. I also agree the fact she did it in front of your children is completely unacceptable. No one wants children growing up thinking that's a healthy adult interaction and that they should accept such treatment from their friends. Ask your wife how she would feel seeing her own children referred to in such a way.. may make her reframe these interactions and see them for how they really are.", "NTA\n\nYou should talk to your wife about how \n\n1) As a father you don't want your children to be exposed to that kind of language, or normalize that kind of relationship to them. \n\n2) As a husband you would not let anyone talk that way to your wife.", "\"She says I just don't understand and that is how her friend is.\"\n\nThat's enabler speak for \"I'm too scared to confront my friend\"\n\nDon't expose your kids to this behavior.  That's not how you should talk in front of kids.  Especially about their mom.  NTA", "my bff calls me barslut. Not in front of the kids tho, your wife's friend needs to learn how to read the room\n  \nNTA", "If she can't control herself around your kids, then you are doing exactly the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nWife needs to have a talk with her friend about appropriate language in front of children (and in public, for that matter).", "Not using particular language around kids makes sense, but some families aren't as careful.  They should respect your wishes when around your kids.  But some good friends and good people really do talk this way.  There's not enough info here to know how she actually treats your wife or what her character is truly like.\n\nWhy can't your wife see her friend while you take care of the kids?  Seems like an easy solution.\n\nNAH - I think it's more of a culture clash, unless you for some reason are keeping your wife from seeing friends on her own.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to be around someone like that, let alone bring my kids (presumably who are kinda young) around someone like that. \n\nIs your wife actually okay with her friend treating her like this? I don't understand why your wife can't hang out with this woman by herself.", "You NTA but I think your wife is. Some friends are from certain aspects of our previous lives. Your wife knows how her friend is and should have agreed about the language not appropriate for children or have gone alone. \n\nHowever, I am confused about her comment saying if you and the kids don\u2019t go she can\u2019t\u2026 what\u2019s that about?", "NAH - I know I can't be the only person that talks like that to some of my friends, right?   \nIf wife isn't upset, then you shouldn't be either, if it's literally just how they speak. I understand not wanting her to talk like that in front of kids, and your wife should ask friend to respect that. But the nicknames are how their friendship goes.", "NTA your wife is for allowing her friend to call her nasty names.\n\nBtw why does that friend call your wife nasty names? Did she have wild past or something?", "NTA. You're doing the exact right thing. Just keep an eye on your wife, we become the people we're around.", "NTA.\n\nfriends can choose how they call each other.\n\nhowever I am one to think that some words have no place in the mouth of someone not able to be subjected to it as an insult. And even then \u2026 \n\nin any case, this kind of langage , especially toward your spouse, has no place being spoken in front of her child. I mean, even if they already knew the word, are they now introduce their mom as the nasty wh\\*re ? Since she seems fine with it ?\n\nthat\u2019s messed up.", "NTA.  \u201cThat\u2019s just how she is\u201d. Soooo the friend is a person who likes to give demeaning comments and insults and the excuse is \u201cthat\u2019s how she is\u201d. \n\nYour wife maybe okay with it because she really wants a friend but the friend is trying to feel power by giving insults that she doesn\u2019t get called out on. \n\nShe \u201ctrapped\u201d you?  \n\nI\u2019m sorry this friend probably has a low self esteem and is low key bullying your wife but your wife is used to it and lets it go. \n\nJust talk to your wife and ask her why she tolerates it. Is she so desperate for a friend", "Since the friend is only calling your wife a whore, and your wife seems fine with it, and it all sounds extremely affectionate, I would chill the fuck out dude. Without a doubt you are the asshole and are dismissing the fact these are your wife's kids too and she does not seem to have a problem with them hearing the word whore. It's fair to ask a friend to chill on language in front of kids. It is not fair to be as outwardly judgemental over her affectionate use of a word that isn't even directed at you. \n\nHowever yta the most for thinking you have a right to tell your wife she can't bring her own children along to hang out with this friend. If she was physically abusive or negligent, you might have some grounds for concern, but affectionately using the term whore? Give me a break.", "ESH. You sound incredibly easy to offend and if your wife is OK with what is pretty obviously a joke, no matter how tasteless you find it, you should leave it alone. I do maintain that you can decide not to see friend for any reason, but you and your wife would ideally agree on if the kids can see this friend or not, I don't think the friend's language entitles you to a unilateral decision there. Your wife sucks bc she should ask her friend to turn it down since it offends you, I also don't understand why she can't see her friend without you and the kids in tow. The friend sucks for calling her friend \"Whore\" around her kids, although I guarantee your clutched pearls they are hearing worse elsewhere.", "ESH. Your wife's friend obviously sucks because any grown adult would realize that's not an appropriate thing to say in front of kids.\n\nYour wife sucks because instead of drawing a hard boundary with her friend and telling her friend not to call her that, ESPECIALLY in front of kids, she's letting you be the fall guy. \n\nAnd finally, you. This needed to be put back in your wife's court instead of unilaterally saying you and the kids will have nothing to do with this friend. You should have expressed to your wife that your friend calling her that name in private is one thing if it doesn't bother your wife, but it bothers you (and should bother your wife) that she did it in public and in front of the kids. This is your wife's issue to handle and you should have made your feeling known and let her handle it.", "NTA. Teach your kids to value themselves more than allowing someone to publically deride them. And I do have friends who play on me and I them... but that is for us and not public humiliation and certainly not in front of their kids or family.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife needs to wake up and realise how nasty her supposed \"friend\" is. She shouldn't be exposing herself, you or your children to that kind of individual.", "INFO I get being upset about swearing in front of the kids if you and your wife have a rule about it. But it sounds like you don't like her friend for a reason that doesn't make sense. Your wife isn't bothered by being called that by her friend. The friend isn't insulting her. Why don't you believe your wife on that?", "Your wife is disrespecting you as the man of the house.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is telling you this isn't a bad name, it's being used as a term of endearment, and yet you think you know better than her and know what's best for her. Get over yourself, man. \n\nIt's one thing to request language filters around young kids, it's a completely different thing than to wholly misunderstand two people's friendship to the point that you think it's bad just because you don't like the jokes they have with eachother.\n\nIf your wife had an issue being called a whore in jest (you're too much of a child to even write out the damn word), she would've said something years ago.", "NTA Will your wife be ok with your kids calling her a W? Because they will as Mom thinks it\u2019s ok.\n\nThe friend sounds gross.", " The friend isn't insulting her.", "My wife is free to see her friend on her own. She chooses to only do things as a family and rarely takes time.to do things on her own. I'm much the same way and honestly haven't been out of the house alone other than for work or dr appointments in the last 9 years.", "I agree with this. It\u2019s definitely offensive to use mean language like that, but it seems like they were used to that language with each other so it\u2019s not that surprising that would be said. Sounds like you\u2019re not comfortable with you and your kids being around her. That\u2019s fair, but you can\u2019t control who your wife sees. She will make decisions about who she keeps company for herself.", "!!!!!!!!!!! \\^\\^", "YTA. Why can't she see her friend alone while you take care of the kids. Some relationships just don't fit in the life of an entire family. They're still important, and deserve respect. If you object to the grown woman for her influence on another grown woman (your wife), you are the bad influence on your family.", "She's free to hang out with her friend on her own, she just choses not to as she doesn't like going out without the kids. She has other friends that we spend time with and none of them talk that way, though many of them are from the same original friend circle as this friend.", "It's her choice. She's free to leave the kids with me anytime she wants but choses to take them along. Whenever I'm home I go along with the family too. Outside of work or dr appointments I can't remember the last time either of us did something completely alone. Being parents has consumed both of our lives, right or wrong that's how we chose to be.\n\nAlso all of our other friends have kids of their own and typically we meet up at one of our houses so the kids can all play while the adults have time socialize.", "It's all fun and games until one of the kids up and calls mama a whore.", "They were friends through high-school.  I'm aware of my wife's past and though she did typical young people things she wasn't by any stretch of the imagination wild.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Nah, fuck that. OP is not an asshole for not wanting to deal with his kids wondering why/thinking it's okay for their mothers 'friend' to refer to her as a whore.", "I'm failing to see this as being affectionate. This same \"friend\" talks down about anyone who didn't move away after high-school/ college and just generally has nothing nice to say about anyone other than herself.  I focused on the whore comment because that's the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. I can quietly deal with negativity but will not stand for insults being thrown in my wife's face.\n\nAs far as your comment about the kids being my wife's also she is bigger on censoring what they see and hear more than I am. This was a \"friend\" she hadn't seen since before having kids she agrees that she would rather not have the kids hear that but had \"hoped (friends name) had matured\"", "I disagree with you calling OP an asshole for this. While yes, it should be on the wife to tell her friend to not talk to her like that, OP was just trying to protect their kids from hearing that woman insult their mother. He's not an asshole for that. \n\nIf anything, not doing what he did and letting the kids hear what this 'friend' calls their mother would be the real asshole move.", "We have rules about language used around the kids. As far as not liking the friend, she never says anything positive about my wife and acts as if she's better than us. An example from the lunch was her saying she hates that her husband's job moved them back closer to home because everyone that didn't move away after high-school never amounted to anything. She kept going on and on about the only successful people are the ones that got out of here. My wife and I chose to stay in the area to be closer to family, but are far from unsuccessful in life. We have our kids, built our dream house on land that we own, and both have good paying jobs were happy with.", "It might be how they greet each other, but calling someone a whore is absolutely an insult.", "I never said she was.", "I think that's an important detail, because otherwise, you could look unreasonable.", "Oh I get it having 3 myself and we do what you do. This friend is clearly a friend for a night out sans kiddies. Best of luck :)", "Okay, that friend needs to show more respect, especially around you and the kids or you should cut her out of your lives", "Have you talked with your wife about this? Your post is all about the \"w\" word.", "I have and she still maintains that that's just how her friend is. She said her friend had a rough childhood and always talked about leaving the area when she grew up.", "That may be true and your wife let's it roll off her back but it bothers you and that is valid. The issue isn't that she calls your wife that, it's that she can't control her language around the kids (assuming you or your wife have told her not to do it before) and that she insults you with her comments."]}
