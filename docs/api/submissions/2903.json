One of them said \"wait for your brother\" This surprised me so I said almost instinctively \"wait a minute, brother?\" in a shocked expression. After I asked this, the kid's mom almost looked nervous but simply answered \"yeah, were the moms\" or something along those lines The thing is after that it seemed like their happiness was gone and the rest of the time we were there it was awkward.

Stop making assumptions about people and you won't find yourself asking stupid questions.", "YTA\n\nOne thing that has served me well in life is asking myself \"Do I NEED to understand this?\" when I see something out and about that I don't immediately get. Do I need to ask my neighbors questions to ensure I understand their domestic arrangement? If I don't get who someone is to someone, does that require me to find out? Sometimes the answer is \"yes,\" I do need to know. More often, the answer is \"no.\" \n\nAlso, you can work on your current inability to consider non-heterosexual partnerships. You don't have to accept that this is an inevitable thing you will do to people.

Your family is lovely though!\u201d Or whatever, basically you could\u2019ve just smoothed it over a bit.

THATS your assumption? Lol YTA", "YTA. Yes, you should have kept your mouth shut. Story for you: I had a good friend who, because of circumstances, couldn't be open about her sexuality. At one point, she had a friend move in with her. They shared that apartment. They moved to a different apartment in the same city. They then moved to a different state. Then another state. Then a third state. Finally a fourth state together. Long about the second state they lived in, I went to myself 'Self, I think they're together.' And went on with my life and our friendship. Six, seven years down the line, I was talking to my friend's 'roommate' and she said 'I told them that my partner's......' and in the back of my brain, there was a 'Well, that 99% certainty just went to 100%' and I still didn't say anything about. About ten minutes after we finished talking, I got another phone call from my friend who said 'Uh...I think we need to talk' The wonderful supportive friend that I am said 'About what?' She was like 'You gonna make me say it?' 'Yep, yes I am' LOL\n\nI'm not sure what you expected of this couple. Were they supposed to hand out flyers about their familial status? Wear signs?

Asking people with a children together if they\u2019re the parents is a pretty normal thing to do.

You are homophobic, or you certainly are extremely biased. \n\nIt would seem that your main issue is how you build up whole lives for virtual strangers. How you assumed the children were the friends, and had somehow introduced the women to one another. Why would that be the case? Surely when all four are together all the time, the most obvious reason would be that they're a family? But your shocked ' brother?' will have outed you as someone who isn't good around gay people. No wonder they looked unhappy. Stop imagining how strangers know one another. You won't make mistakes like this that way.", "YTA.\nYou may not have intended to be, but you were.

You're hiding homophobia behind the \"innocent\" curtain of obliviousness. You're currently homophobic, but the great news is that that's incredibly curable! Start by apologizing without excuses. \"I'm really sorry, that was a crap thing to say\" not \"I'm really sorry, I just...\" Bring a gift to the apology: flowers are always good. Then look up \"they were roommates\" memes for lesbian invisibility in history.

In this case, it would have seemed more homophobic the more shocked you were.\n\nThe reasoning behind your comment makes you a bigot in this case. If you hadn't heard what she said, maybe it would have sounded less bigoted.

Quit being dense.", "Unintentional YTA.  You were oblivious and awkward rather than  malicious, but damage was still done. It's not irreparable, though.  Next time you see them in the common room make a point to be extra friendly, and consider making a joke at your own expense about your inability to read a room (dont turn it into a whole bit though, thats even more uncomfortable).  Your goal is to communicate that you are not hateful, just a bit clueless at times so they know they can still relax when they see you in the common areas", "Yes you should\u2019ve kept your mouth shut.

Socially unaware maybe.", "YTA- Yes and ask yourself why you're so incredulous to that?  What part of yourself does that kind of impulsive response to homosexual relationships come from?", "YTA. Yes you should have", "Pffft. Idk about this one. I don't think you forced them to come out. They are clearly already very out, living a happy life with two kids. The issue is actually that you made an assumption and when you realised you were wrong, you made it awkward. \n\nSo I guess soft YTA, but not so much of one that you couldn't fix it with an apology and maybe taking a lesson from this to open your mind a bit.", "YTA. Even if the \u2018brother\u2019 comment surprised you\u2026 you definitely should have kept your mouth shut.

Big time. \n\nYou can\u2019t just put context clues together, you have to point it out? Also, if they are hesitant in the way they responded I can almost promise the tone in the way you said it, pretty clearly displayed that you didn\u2019t agree with their lifestyle. You were why they were awkward. \n\nAlso; heteronormative = homophobic. It\u2019s essentially the same thing so you are not saving face by taking the different title\u2026..", "Wow. As a socially awkward person (I usually don\u2018t assume things about people I don\u2018t really know) I have been baffled by some things like people being in a relationship that was \u201eobvious\u201c to some. Or people being \u201eobviously\u201c homosexual. I think you\u2018re NTA and I don\u2018t really understand why people say it\u2018s none of your business.

It was hurtful and uncomfortable for them, and realistically some of their discomfort was bc they were worried for their own safety and their children. People who gasp at the notion of queerness aren\u2019t always kind to queer people, and sometimes are genuine dangers. They were probably reevaluating if you are someone they can feel safe and comfortable around.\n\nBut if this was a genuine mistake, and if your awareness indicates that you are working on it, that you\u2019re trying and growing, then while you may have been the one in the wrong in this interaction, I\u2019m not willing to condemn you as a person. They\u2019re allowed to no longer feel comfortable around you, but it\u2019s also okay that you aren\u2019t perfect, that you\u2019re a work in progress, so long as you are moving in the right direction. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to have biases, so long as you work to acknowledge them and grow beyond them.", "YTA. I will admit I\u2019m guilty of being oblivious to people\u2019s sexuality but it\u2019s because I legitimately don\u2019t care. I want people to love who they love and live in peace. Once I do figure out otherwise I don\u2019t vocalize surprise, disdain, or even excitement I just keep going along minding my business and treating everyone with respect. It\u2019s super easy and it\u2019s never caused me or the people around me any issues. Also, I read this and had to look up heteronormative, which I learned is just a nicer way of saying homophobic.

It\u2019s usually society as a whole, or specific institutions or policies, that are called heteronormative.\n\n\nI still think OP is an asshole, because they seem to be a grown adult content in their ignorance making no effort to grow beyond their bias\u2014and because their reaction was, intentional or not, to treat these women like some sort of spectacle\u2014but I doubt someone referring to heteronormativity meant to indicate any intentional discrimination against queerness", "Ha!
