Stop making assumptions about people and you won't find yourself asking stupid questions.", "YTA\n\nOne thing that has served me well in life is asking myself \"Do I NEED to understand this?\" when I see something out and about that I don't immediately get. Do I need to ask my neighbors questions to ensure I understand their domestic arrangement? If I don't get who someone is to someone, does that require me to find out? Sometimes the answer is \"yes,\" I do need to know. More often, the answer is \"no.\" \n\nAlso, you can work on your current inability to consider non-heterosexual partnerships. You don't have to accept that this is an inevitable thing you will do to people.

Your family is lovely though!\u201d Or whatever, basically you could\u2019ve just smoothed it over a bit.

THATS your assumption? Lol YTA", "YTA. Yes, you should have kept your mouth shut. Story for you: I had a good friend who, because of circumstances, couldn't be open about her sexuality. At one point, she had a friend move in with her. They shared that apartment. They moved to a different apartment in the same city. They then moved to a different state. Then another state. Then a third state. Finally a fourth state together. Long about the second state they lived in, I went to myself 'Self, I think they're together.' And went on with my life and our friendship. Six, seven years down the line, I was talking to my friend's 'roommate' and she said 'I told them that my partner's......' and in the back of my brain, there was a 'Well, that 99% certainty just went to 100%' and I still didn't say anything about. About ten minutes after we finished talking, I got another phone call from my friend who said 'Uh...I think we need to talk' The wonderful supportive friend that I am said 'About what?' She was like 'You gonna make me say it?' 'Yep, yes I am' LOL\n\nI'm not sure what you expected of this couple. Were they supposed to hand out flyers about their familial status? Wear signs?

Asking people with a children together if they\u2019re the parents is a pretty normal thing to do.

You are homophobic, or you certainly are extremely biased. \n\nIt would seem that your main issue is how you build up whole lives for virtual strangers. How you assumed the children were the friends, and had somehow introduced the women to one another. Why would that be the case? Surely when all four are together all the time, the most obvious reason would be that they're a family? But your shocked ' brother?' will have outed you as someone who isn't good around gay people. No wonder they looked unhappy. Stop imagining how strangers know one another. You won't make mistakes like this that way.", "YTA.\nYou may not have intended to be, but you were.

You certainly can apologize for the misunderstanding...and practice your filter. Lots of us have thoughts that generally should not come out of our mouths.

You're hiding homophobia behind the \"innocent\" curtain of obliviousness. You're currently homophobic, but the great news is that that's incredibly curable! Start by apologizing without excuses. \"I'm really sorry, that was a crap thing to say\" not \"I'm really sorry, I just...\" Bring a gift to the apology: flowers are always good. Then look up \"they were roommates\" memes for lesbian invisibility in history.

In this case, it would have seemed more homophobic the more shocked you were.\n\nThe reasoning behind your comment makes you a bigot in this case. If you hadn't heard what she said, maybe it would have sounded less bigoted.

Quit being dense.", "Unintentional YTA.  You were oblivious and awkward rather than  malicious, but damage was still done. It's not irreparable, though.  Next time you see them in the common room make a point to be extra friendly, and consider making a joke at your own expense about your inability to read a room (dont turn it into a whole bit though, thats even more uncomfortable).  Your goal is to communicate that you are not hateful, just a bit clueless at times so they know they can still relax when they see you in the common areas", "Yes you should\u2019ve kept your mouth shut.

Socially unaware maybe.", "YTA- Yes and ask yourself why you're so incredulous to that?  What part of yourself does that kind of impulsive response to homosexual relationships come from?", "YTA. Yes you should have", "Pffft. Idk about this one. I don't think you forced them to come out. They are clearly already very out, living a happy life with two kids. The issue is actually that you made an assumption and when you realised you were wrong, you made it awkward. \n\nSo I guess soft YTA, but not so much of one that you couldn't fix it with an apology and maybe taking a lesson from this to open your mind a bit.", "YTA. Even if the \u2018brother\u2019 comment surprised you\u2026 you definitely should have kept your mouth shut.

Big time. \n\nYou can\u2019t just put context clues together, you have to point it out? Also, if they are hesitant in the way they responded I can almost promise the tone in the way you said it, pretty clearly displayed that you didn\u2019t agree with their lifestyle. You were why they were awkward. \n\nAlso; heteronormative = homophobic. It\u2019s essentially the same thing so you are not saving face by taking the different title\u2026..", "Wow. As a socially awkward person (I usually don\u2018t assume things about people I don\u2018t really know) I have been baffled by some things like people being in a relationship that was \u201eobvious\u201c to some. Or people being \u201eobviously\u201c homosexual. I think you\u2018re NTA and I don\u2018t really understand why people say it\u2018s none of your business.

It was hurtful and uncomfortable for them, and realistically some of their discomfort was bc they were worried for their own safety and their children. People who gasp at the notion of queerness aren\u2019t always kind to queer people, and sometimes are genuine dangers. They were probably reevaluating if you are someone they can feel safe and comfortable around.\n\nBut if this was a genuine mistake, and if your awareness indicates that you are working on it, that you\u2019re trying and growing, then while you may have been the one in the wrong in this interaction, I\u2019m not willing to condemn you as a person. They\u2019re allowed to no longer feel comfortable around you, but it\u2019s also okay that you aren\u2019t perfect, that you\u2019re a work in progress, so long as you are moving in the right direction. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to have biases, so long as you work to acknowledge them and grow beyond them.", "YTA. I will admit I\u2019m guilty of being oblivious to people\u2019s sexuality but it\u2019s because I legitimately don\u2019t care. I want people to love who they love and live in peace. Once I do figure out otherwise I don\u2019t vocalize surprise, disdain, or even excitement I just keep going along minding my business and treating everyone with respect. It\u2019s super easy and it\u2019s never caused me or the people around me any issues. Also, I read this and had to look up heteronormative, which I learned is just a nicer way of saying homophobic.

(Smile in a friendly way) so how did you two meet?", "NTA, just next time you see them be like sorry if I made you uncomfortable it just never crossed my mind you were partners and not just friends, I know that's completely oblivious of me, i dont have anything against it and it doesnt change my opinion or way of interacrion at all..... \n\nIf anything you seeing a gay couple together and thinking nothing of it is a good thing as it is what it is.", "And probably the way OP said \"wait a minute, brother?!\" and not doing anything to wave away the awkwardness like laugh it off made them worried they were dealing with a homophobe who just realized they were a couple. Like, if I was in a same-sex relationship and someone made a big deal about realizing that, that's what I'd be thinking.", "It's like gay women have to be super butch and gay men have to be flamboyant in order to register in OP's mind. LGBTQIA+ folks come in all varieties... constantly seeing two woman with children be together and assuming they are just \"friends\" is homophobic.", "Seriously. We don\u2019t have to shout it from the rooftops and leave the house decked only in rainbow attire so that you can connect the obvious dots.", "Wouldn't it be more normal and accepting that he didn't think or concern himself with how/what/who they did behind closed doors? Didn't spare much thought to their sexuality? Isn't that what everyone wants?", "\"Get your lesbian feet out of my shoes!\" \"She's lesbian? Her birthday's in March; I thought she was a Pisces.\" \"She's not Lebanese; she's Punjabi.\"", "I did that too, once! When I was a child and didn't know what being gay or a lesbian meant.", "The thing that gets me is how many logical leaps and assumptions OP had to make to \"heternormalize\" these two women as gal pals.  \n\nThe simplest assumption when you see two women with children *constantly* all together is that they are a family unit... not \"mom friends\". The fact that OP had to jump through so many hoops and make up so many assumptions in order to \"heternormalize\", as well as OP's open shock upon discovering the reality, is, in fact, indicative of homophobia. \n\nEven as a queer person myself, I could *maybe* excuse OP's assumptions as mere ignorance if it wasn't for their shock upon \"the reveal\", which indicates that, to OP, lesbians and family units with non-heterosexual parents are both shocking and abnormal.", "Saammee. \n\nAlso: OP - things weren\u2019t awkward because you \u201cforced\u201d them to come out, they became awkward because they just realized that you needed to be TOLD they were a couple and that you are not a safe person for them as a queer couple. \n\nThe problem isn\u2019t them or then taking you they are gay, the problem is YOU and your ridiculous assumption plus your extreme shock at the idea that your assumption want right. \n\nAnd yeah, you might want to do some investigating because \u201cI\u2019m not homophobic\u201d Is not an accurate description of you.", "i\u2019m bisexual. this isn\u2019t homophobic and you\u2019re making it out to be something it isn\u2019t lmfao. they just didn\u2019t assume that they were gay, how is that a problem? maybe focus on actual homophobes.", "Right? Everyone makes stupid assumptions sometimes. The way to make good is to call yourself out and apologize. If you added \"oh, duh, of course you are the moms! I'm an idiot, sorry about that. Nice to meet you by the way\" you would be N T A \n\nHowever if you blinked at them in stunned silence, and assume you're forcing this clearly already out couple into some embarrassing admission, YTA\n\nYou can still turn this around though. An honest apology next time you see them and some statement of neighborly goodwill would probably go a long way", "it doesn't anymore (it did at the time)", "Yeah best case scenario it was a little awkward. Worst case scenario you may have made them feel unsafe. This person they felt comfortable with (and knows where they and their children live) suddenly got wildly uncomfortable when they found out they were gay. \n\nThat can be fucking scary depending on how you handled it.", "two mothers that are friends because their kids are (or vise versa)", "Seriously. You don\u2019t have to be ranting and raving and carrying a hateful sign to be homophobic. Micro aggressions like this are insidious.", "\u201cSelf, you realize they live in a one-bedroom apartment, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy yes, Self, I do. I have to sleep on the couch when I go visit.\u201d\n\nMental conversation I had once. And that was about as much thought as I had about the situation.", ">You surely have learned that not every single thought that pops into your head needs to come out of your mouth\n\nI never cease to be amazed at how many people have never mastered this extremely basic life skill.", "That he said their happiness was gone the rest of the time they were there afterward would indicate that OP did not react well.  I\u2019ve been occasionally surprised to learn people are couples but none of them seemed to lose their joy when I found out.  If anything, they seemed happier with the revelation (this has happened with both straight & gay couples that I knew casually or professionally)", "So true, I don't think there was a bad intention, just an impulsive reaction - as you said the words left the mouth before the brain engaged... \n\nI also have done something similar, referring to her boyfriend as a dad. It was a huge presumption on my part. They both laughed it off obviously used to it due to a huge and very visible age gap, but I felt horrible and still do when I think of it...  didn't have a bad intention at all, it is just a cultural/social norm so deeply rooted that made me presume they were dad and daughter, not a couple.", "Straight people, especially of a certain age( over 40 or 50) assume everyone is straight. If my wife and I were the same race I have no doubt that we\u2019d get the sisters/cousins treatment too. When I\u2019m alone people are visibly shocked when they realize that I am a lesbian woman. People will act like we are not together at a store if we\u2019re paying and ask if our meals are together. I do not think that it\u2019s all intentionally homophobic. Statistically most women do date and marry men. I don\u2019t bring it up constantly, so\u2026Someone recently forgot that I had a wife and I wasn\u2019t even offended, I took it as a sign of progress. Some people think that being gay is not noteworthy. Good. We are a butch and femme couple too.", "This exactly.\n\nI have read OP's post few times and I really think there was no malicious intent.", "Yup. Being obliviously heteronormative happens to a lot of us. If you find yourself sticking your foot in your mouth because of that, a quick apology and show of warmth will go a long way towards smoothing things over. \u201cI\u2019m an oblivious idiot who didn\u2019t realize you two were a couple until just now. I just thought you were mom friends. Sorry for making things awkward with my dumb assumptions. How long have you been together?\u201d\n\nAssuming and saying stupid things is part of being human. But you say a lot about your true feelings and intentions by how you react.", "Just gals being pals ya know?", "guys don't think about this.  i'm not sure why people think guys have deep thoughts about other peoples relationships. They don't even have deep thoughts about their own relationships.", "That would not be normal. Noticing that two people are married doesn\u2019t necessitate the need to think about what goes on in their bedroom. Do you have those thoughts about your parents?", "\"Lesbian? Lesbian. *gasp* LESBIAN!\"", "The mental gymnastics are hilarious. Two people living together, raising a family together, parenting together, I am sure at points being affectionate or \"coupley\" yet surely they are just friends!", "If you aren\u2019t driving a subaru, wearing exclusively rainbow clothing, speaking with mr. slave affect, and in the process of moving in with the girl you just met a few hours ago while doing a drag performance how can anyone be expected to know you\u2019re gay??????", "Or, having already stuck their foot in it, hopefully they apologized and told the couple that while they were surprised they are also very cool with it.  Likely still would have been awkward, but hopefully they said something so that the women aren\u2019t looking over their shoulders for discriminatory garbage.", "You speak as if the OP actually gave more than two thoughts for them. Like he sat at home formulating why they couldn't possibly be gay. Sounds like he walked past them half a dozen times in the hallway and just made an assumption and didn't dwell on it at all.\n\nAnd the 'shock' was THEIR shock, not his. Who knows what crossed his face when he realized? Maybe he made an ugly face and betrayed his true feelings which he didn't share here? But it seems like they assumed he would be against it and homophobic probably about as fast as he 'assumed' they were just mom friends.", ">she does and still uses it describe herself\n\nDid you not notice the \"boy\" in u/redditboy123451?", "And sleep over a lot - you know for the kids.", ">(it did at the time)\n\nBut why?", "So you thought they were just\u2026 really good friends? YTA, you should work on that \u201cheteronormativity\u201d of yours since it\u2019s really just homophobia.\n\nAnd before you try to counter that you\u2019re not homophobic, homophobia is defined as a \u201cprejudice against gay people\u201d which you display since prejudice is a \u201cpreconceived notion that is not based on reason or actual experience.\u201d", "LOL. Yep, that was a stray thought too. It just never mattered to me one way or the other. I wasn't going to treat them any differently. I didn't have to police my language or jokes with them. Nothing changed after I found out.", "Happens to me all the time...you don't look gay. --\\_\\_-- my sideeye.", "Just cousins (cough Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune)", "It's not a \"deep thought\" to see a couple and register them as a couple though?? It's just basic observation skills", "Jeels. Jeels Chrisse.", "OP: \u201cThis surprised me so I said almost instinctively \u2018wait a minute, brother?\u2019 in a shocked expression.\u201d OP was obviously shocked, and admitted it themselves. The fact that it was that difficult for them to realize it\u2019s a couple is indicative that they *did* think about the couple enough to explain away all the obvious signs.\n\nAnd it makes sense that the couple would be wary when someone draws potentially negative public attention to the fact that they\u2019re a gay couple. Their suspicion would be rooted in caution, not hatred.", "I guess I took it more as an active 'promoting' rather than a general world view definition. Got it now.", "Yeah that's what I thought too.", "For all of us that needed to also look this up.

Are you? If not, perhaps find a way to show them you don\u2019t actually hate them by using your words.

The \u201cpromoting\u201d bit is definitely where the translation gets mixed up from a systemic problem to an individual one.\n\nThat refers more to broad societal promotion of heterosexuality as the norm, like the emphasis little girls grow up w on disney princesses and finding your \u201cprince charming\u201d\n\nIndividuals arent really themselves heteronormative, it\u2019s more that they can buy into society\u2019s heteronormativity then perpetuate that assumption that straight is the default", "That makes sense,thank you.", "They are so close they both answer whenever one of the kids calls \"Mum!\"", "Thank you! \ud83d\udc4d"]}
