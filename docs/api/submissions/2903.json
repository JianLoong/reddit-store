Stop making assumptions about people and you won't find yourself asking stupid questions.", "YTA\n\nOne thing that has served me well in life is asking myself \"Do I NEED to understand this?\" when I see something out and about that I don't immediately get. Do I need to ask my neighbors questions to ensure I understand their domestic arrangement? If I don't get who someone is to someone, does that require me to find out? Sometimes the answer is \"yes,\" I do need to know. More often, the answer is \"no.\" \n\nAlso, you can work on your current inability to consider non-heterosexual partnerships. You don't have to accept that this is an inevitable thing you will do to people.

Your family is lovely though!\u201d Or whatever, basically you could\u2019ve just smoothed it over a bit. Maybe be extra friendly next time you see them, and if they still seem nervous around you then pull them aside privately and apologize/ensure them that you\u2019re not judging them", "Yta.

THATS your assumption? Lol YTA", "YTA. Yes, you should have kept your mouth shut. Story for you: I had a good friend who, because of circumstances, couldn't be open about her sexuality. At one point, she had a friend move in with her. They shared that apartment. They moved to a different apartment in the same city. They then moved to a different state. Then another state. Then a third state. Finally a fourth state together. Long about the second state they lived in, I went to myself 'Self, I think they're together.' And went on with my life and our friendship. Six, seven years down the line, I was talking to my friend's 'roommate' and she said 'I told them that my partner's......' and in the back of my brain, there was a 'Well, that 99% certainty just went to 100%' and I still didn't say anything about. About ten minutes after we finished talking, I got another phone call from my friend who said 'Uh...I think we need to talk' The wonderful supportive friend that I am said 'About what?' She was like 'You gonna make me say it?' 'Yep, yes I am' LOL\n\nI'm not sure what you expected of this couple. Were they supposed to hand out flyers about their familial status? Wear signs? You should get out of your 'heteronormative' bubble and stop putting people in boxes. I would hate to see what you would assume about me, my husband and our chosen family.", "I don\u2019t think yta for asking. Asking people with a children together if they\u2019re the parents is a pretty normal thing to do.

You are homophobic, or you certainly are extremely biased. \n\nIt would seem that your main issue is how you build up whole lives for virtual strangers. How you assumed the children were the friends, and had somehow introduced the women to one another. Why would that be the case? Surely when all four are together all the time, the most obvious reason would be that they're a family? But your shocked ' brother?' will have outed you as someone who isn't good around gay people. No wonder they looked unhappy. Stop imagining how strangers know one another. You won't make mistakes like this that way.", "YTA.\nYou may not have intended to be, but you were. Commenting on ANY assumed relation between people is generally rude. You may not be explicitly homophobic, but you are definitely making assumptions about people you don't know.\n\nYou may not have intended any harm, but harm was done. You certainly can apologize for the misunderstanding...and practice your filter. Lots of us have thoughts that generally should not come out of our mouths.

You're hiding homophobia behind the \"innocent\" curtain of obliviousness. You're currently homophobic, but the great news is that that's incredibly curable! Start by apologizing without excuses. \"I'm really sorry, that was a crap thing to say\" not \"I'm really sorry, I just...\" Bring a gift to the apology: flowers are always good. Then look up \"they were roommates\" memes for lesbian invisibility in history. And spend some time thinking about why you think it's healthy and normal to pretend some types of people don't exist.", "Yta\n\nI understand that you think you are not TA because you made a thoughtless comment and you don't consider yourself a homophobe.\n\nThe thing is, making thoughtless comments makes you an asshole, regardless if bigotry inspired it. In this case, it would have seemed more homophobic the more shocked you were.\n\nThe reasoning behind your comment makes you a bigot in this case. If you hadn't heard what she said, maybe it would have sounded less bigoted.

Quit being dense.", "Unintentional YTA.  You were oblivious and awkward rather than  malicious, but damage was still done. It's not irreparable, though.  Next time you see them in the common room make a point to be extra friendly, and consider making a joke at your own expense about your inability to read a room (dont turn it into a whole bit though, thats even more uncomfortable).  Your goal is to communicate that you are not hateful, just a bit clueless at times so they know they can still relax when they see you in the common areas", "Yes you should\u2019ve kept your mouth shut.

Socially unaware maybe.", "YTA- Yes and ask yourself why you're so incredulous to that?  What part of yourself does that kind of impulsive response to homosexual relationships come from?", "YTA. Yes you should have", "Pffft. Idk about this one. I don't think you forced them to come out. They are clearly already very out, living a happy life with two kids. The issue is actually that you made an assumption and when you realised you were wrong, you made it awkward. \n\nSo I guess soft YTA, but not so much of one that you couldn't fix it with an apology and maybe taking a lesson from this to open your mind a bit.", "YTA. Even if the \u2018brother\u2019 comment surprised you\u2026 you definitely should have kept your mouth shut.

Big time. \n\nYou can\u2019t just put context clues together, you have to point it out? Also, if they are hesitant in the way they responded I can almost promise the tone in the way you said it, pretty clearly displayed that you didn\u2019t agree with their lifestyle. You were why they were awkward. \n\nAlso; heteronormative = homophobic. It\u2019s essentially the same thing so you are not saving face by taking the different title\u2026..", "Wow. As a socially awkward person (I usually don\u2018t assume things about people I don\u2018t really know) I have been baffled by some things like people being in a relationship that was \u201eobvious\u201c to some. Or people being \u201eobviously\u201c homosexual. I think you\u2018re NTA and I don\u2018t really understand why people say it\u2018s none of your business.

It was hurtful and uncomfortable for them, and realistically some of their discomfort was bc they were worried for their own safety and their children. People who gasp at the notion of queerness aren\u2019t always kind to queer people, and sometimes are genuine dangers. They were probably reevaluating if you are someone they can feel safe and comfortable around.\n\nBut if this was a genuine mistake, and if your awareness indicates that you are working on it, that you\u2019re trying and growing, then while you may have been the one in the wrong in this interaction, I\u2019m not willing to condemn you as a person. They\u2019re allowed to no longer feel comfortable around you, but it\u2019s also okay that you aren\u2019t perfect, that you\u2019re a work in progress, so long as you are moving in the right direction. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to have biases, so long as you work to acknowledge them and grow beyond them.", "YTA. I will admit I\u2019m guilty of being oblivious to people\u2019s sexuality but it\u2019s because I legitimately don\u2019t care. I want people to love who they love and live in peace. Once I do figure out otherwise I don\u2019t vocalize surprise, disdain, or even excitement I just keep going along minding my business and treating everyone with respect. It\u2019s super easy and it\u2019s never caused me or the people around me any issues. Also, I read this and had to look up heteronormative, which I learned is just a nicer way of saying homophobic.

If they start kissing, that\u2019s when I\u2019m like oh, ok. Just like a girl and a guy. If I don\u2019t know they\u2019re together, they could be friends.

Without looking at the comments I assumed it was what you were describing but it\u2019s not exactly. You got the part of assuming ppl are straight just by looking at them right but it goes into more of a homophobic idealist view. You believe it\u2019s normal or natural to be straight while you think being gay is the exact opposite. In your case you prolly would be shocked even tho others would\u2019ve easily gotten it right away but by their reaction, I feel like maybe you are too upfront on your views. The best thing you could ever do is shut your mouth. No one needs to know what you think about them and no one needs to hear the moment you realized they were gay.

I dont Think it makes you the asshole or homophobic. When she said brother it clicked in your head and you just started to think out loud. The couple might have felt judged being that there are homophobic people in the world and it sucks you made them feel that way but it doesn\u2019t sound like it was with that intent. \nEveryone in the world expects everyone else to just know things about their life and are offended if they don\u2019t but people should get over themselves.

There\u2019s a difference between being pretty oblivious by nature and having to reorganize your views to create a false narrative to avoid coming to the (logical) conclusion that the women in question are in a romantic relationship. I find it even more concerning that OP minimizes the behavior and does not appear to understand how blatantly homophobic they are.\n\nOP, if you want to better yourself, get some education on microaggressions in the LGBTQ community and learn how to be a better human.

No shame, just do better.", "As someone who can be stupid sometimes, even though I'm bi and am usually good at spotting other lgbtq+ people...

Come on, be happy together. I told them the kids were adorable and we talked about craft projects.", "I mean, that's not true. Homophobic means expressly disliking, being biased against, or being prejudiced against people because they are homosexual. If you grew up somewhere where you weren't exposed to lots of LGBTQ+ people, it is reasonable to assume that a pair of women together with two children are two mom friends (as that is what you were exposed to most growing up, it is what you will assume). I'm going to take them at their word that they said it \"instinctively\" (i.e. out of surprise, impulsive and without thought), but if they're lying that does change things. Reacting in such a way is to be expected, and is not conducive of actual prejudice against homosexual people. Rather, it shows an unfamiliarity, which is not equivalent to prejudice. In any case, I do think they're in the wrong (as in, they should not have said anything), but not necessarily that they are an asshole.", "Seeing two parents parenting their kids and not being able to conceive of them as a family because the parents are the same gender is a prejudice.", "Yes!
