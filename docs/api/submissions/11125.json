We don't sleep in the same bed nor even on the same floor, so I can easily get up with them still sleeping, and vice versa.\n\nIn the kindergarten, pretty much the only specific schedule points are meals. Breakfast is 9 - 9.20 AM. If the kid is late for that, no breakfast.\n\nToday, I woke up to my alarm at 9.30 AM, when I have to get up for work. I immediately realized, that wife and kid must still be asleep. Oh well, I thought. The kid was ill over the weekend, wife was up till late night hours, and breakfast is gone already. If they both didn't get up to their alarm, then I guess they do need more sleep. At this point, why not let them? I am not waking them up for now. Let them sleep.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later my wife woke up. She immediately started shouting variations of \"We are late! Look at the time! Why did you not wake us up! We are paying for this kindergarten!\" I tried to calmly explain my reasoning, that there no longer is anything to be in a hurry for. No real deadline to make now. The next meal would be in like 3 hours. I tried to say, repeatedly, that at this point using the money we are paying for the kindergarten to full extent is far less important to me compared to them just getting the rest they apparently needed.\n\nIt was quite hard to say anything, though. My wife kept shouting over me, interrupting me constantly. She shouted she can't believe how irrational I am (damned if I understand how was that irrational, maybe someone else can explain it to me), that \"you are supposed to wake us up if you see we are late!\"... That \"it's been long since you angered me, but now you really did it\", which pissed me off quite substantially, but still remained calm... I also said something like \"I thought you would be glad to see your wellbeing is more important to me than taking full advantage of some pocket change\". Response, in shouting tone \"Well do you see me being glad?! Am I glad now?!\"\n\nFinally I've had it, and told her, still calm, that until she calms down and rethinks this, I don't want her talking to me. Reaction was something like \"No, you don't speak to me! And what did I do to you, boo-hoo-hoo, poor thing?!\" That's a theme I've been fighting with our entire 11 years of relationship. I detest it, when someone shouts at me. And I believe married people should never shout at each other, it feels immensely wrong to me - and for what? So that triggered me to shout back \"I will not be treated this way, and you know it perfectly well!\".\n\nThen I locked myself in my room to work, wife and kid went to the kindergarten.

Love doesn't mean, that you never fight. Love means, that you still stay together, even after the toughest fights. \n\nBesides that, NTA. I think, that she is just worried about the lost money, which isn't a wrong mindset (espacially in this times). Paired with the stress of a sick kid and the stress of waking up late that might cause an overreaction. Give her some time to calm down and I'm sure, you get along pretty well.

So a part y t a for just making life harder than it needed to be.  She does share responsibility, however, because an alarm is also easy to set.  Also, depending on how your school does lunch count and attendance that is an annoying hiccup in other people's day to not send notice of lateness or absence.   In the end I would say ESH but it's just so small that the annoyance and argumentative levels are way heightened.

Caring for a child is how you build your relationship with them.\n\nI\u2019d prioritize the relationship you have with your child at this point. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible your wife is with you solely for financial support. That doesn\u2019t make her a gold digger. It means there doesn\u2019t seem to be emotional support for her, so she\u2019s walled you off in self defense. It must be incredibly painful for her to constantly feel rejected when you shut yourself away not just from her but especially your child.\n\nBecome more involved with parenting. Take on the responsibility of getting your little one to school along with your wife. You should be doing housework along with your wife and child. That\u2019s a form of family bonding you are depriving your child of. Everyone can help cook. A toddler can rip lettuce up for salad, one adult can chop vegetables while the other makes pasta. There\u2019s a lot of chatting that happens in a full kitchen. Everyone can help clean up. One adult can wash and the other dry and give easy unbreakable items to a toddler to help dry and put away too. Everyone can help pick up and put away items, two can dust while an adult sweeps. Everyone can go to the market together and help bring in groceries.

But you need to be honest with yourself, even if she won't be.\n\nHer refusal to listen, her yelling indicates lack of respect, even disdain for you. That's critical.  Disdain is the number 1 predictor of divorce.\n\nAsk yourself what your next steps are in case you realize she doesnt respect you, and/or doesnt love you.  Because  that seems to be where you are right now.  Your marriage has a wound that may very well be a mortal wound.\n\nIn a calm moment, you can ask her, one at a time, if she loves you. If she respects you. Be silent, pause, wait and listen for a loooooong time after you ask each question. Dont jump in, just wait. Look at her with an open, uncritical gaze. Wait even longer after she answers each question. She will answer more. You want her to know that a superficial or quick answer isnt enough. Be really straight, no soft pedaling. Be ready for anger, denial, dismissing.  If that happens, you have your answer. The marriage is next to dead, and your next question is: \"How do we extricate ourselves from this marriage?\"\n\nDont pretend that anything you have been doing already is going to work. More of the same is just more and more pain and conflict. You both need to *want* to work together to make it better, and if she doesnt want to, you cant fix it yourself. \n\nAt that point, all you can do is choose the best path for yourself and your child, and do that regardless of her. \n\nHowever, if she DOES want to fix it, she needs to join you in the action. You will both figure out what to do next, as a team. You cant solve it alone. \n\nGood luck, I hope this helps.", "Honest advice? Individual therapy. Self confidence.\n\nYou tried walking away. You tried solving it together. Next step is standing up for yourself, without escalating the fight.

Typically it\u2019s her responsibility to manage the fur babies and unpack as I work 2 full time jobs and financially keep the house running. She hadn\u2019t slept in almost 3 nights due to having trouble breathing - I also haven\u2019t slept as she fought to get comfortable and I tried to help as much as I could as well as was concerned about her state even after a trip to urgent care and the ER. Regardless, yesterday after work I managed to do all of her chores, take care of the babies (dogs, cats and ferrets), do all of my chores and unpack all but one VERY large bag of hers. The only reason I didn\u2019t unpack that bag was because I shared that I knew she needed rest and that I was willing to jump in and she asked me to hold off on that bag and she would take care of it when she felt better. That was HER choice. I agreed and I\u2019m waking up today EXHAUSTED but I know it\u2019s what she needs right now and when I get sick she will return the same support. \n\nI hope this helps\u2026 best of luck!", "That is also an assumption.
