(3M)   My sister fell pregnant back in 2019, I\u2019ve been with her every step of her pregnancy until he was born in 2020. As soon as he came home from the hospital she wanted nothing to do with him, I had to take the parent role, I fed, changed clothed and put him to sleep. We both live together with our mum. (I\u2019m her full time carer) After nine months of me caring for him while she lounged around and relaxed she finally wanted her son. He had a routine that had been working amazingly but she upped and changed that therefore having a cranky baby, she started getting shitty at me because he never wanted her, only me.  \n\n I think it is important to point out that at home she never interacted with him, it was only when we were out in the public that she did, she had to push his stroller, she had to get his car seat out ect ect. If I was seen with the baby she had to step in saying \u201cI want MY son back\u201d.\n\n  Fast forward to this year, for his third birthday I brought him a three wheeled scooter, toys and clothes. She yelled at me that it wasn\u2019t my place to buy him expensive things. I\u2019m not usually one to gloat about money due to barely having enough to function for myself but for occasions like those I splurge out. She said that I made her look like a fool and a bad mum because she didn\u2019t spend as much. But now he\u2019s a toddler he understands I\u2019m his aunt and addresses me as auntie and knows she\u2019s his mother.

But she takes him to preschool and picks him up.  \n\nRecently these past months she\u2019s been pulling him away from me and not in a good way, in a way where if I go to give him a d hug or a kiss on the head she\u2019ll pick him up, or pull him away or even tell me to leave him alone, she\u2019ll tell me to stop winding him up when I\u2019m playing with him and he\u2019s laughing and I\u2019m so hurt and confused, today I had a major arguement with her where she kept telling me \u201che\u2019s MY SON\u201d and my responses were \u201cI raised him for you for three fucking years\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done everything for him\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more of a mother to that boy than you have been. \u201c she called me a asshole and stormed off, grabbed my nephew and hid him from me.

I've never heard anyone say it in person but I have heard it quite frequently on here and in other writings.", "That\u2019s the thing though, I do fear for his safety. When she has him she doesn\u2019t even watch him. She\u2019s just sat on her phone, I\u2019ve walked in and he\u2019s eating things he shouldn\u2019t be, or he\u2019s gotten ahold of her energy drinks she leaves on the floor.", "That\u2019s what Post Natal depression is, she had it for two months before the symptoms started to waver, on the third month she was eased of medication by doctors and a MH specialist, since then she\u2019s been perfect (just it in caring for her son)", "It was a argument. After three years of raising her son for her I had a breaking point, while she went out with her friends and partied a lot, I had to stay home with her son. I\u2019ve lost a lot of friends due to this. She\u2019s told me she likes that I have a close relationship with my nephew as it makes it easier for her to go out with friends, and when she\u2019s around and I\u2019m with him, she\u2019s constantly on her phone ignoring him, for example today I was painting with him and he was so happy he wanted to show her, he ran up to her holding his painting \u201cmummy look!\u201d She told him to go away and show me. So there\u2019s not a difference that\u2019s happening.", "if you eventually want to get custody of your nephew... you need to start documenting a lot more than just your purchases. you need to start logging times you watch him. doctors appointments you take him to. meals you've made. texts/calls between you and your sister/family where you're asked to take care of him and berated when you refuse. honestly every thing you do that a parent ought to be and that your sister isn't. \n\n[this is a good post.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ForwardPlenty/comments/dtg7f2/the_fu_binder/) read it. take it to heart.\n\nbut unfortunately - part of this is also going to unfortunately involve... letting your sister fail. you need to stop being a safety net. will your nephew fall? yes. will he suffer? yeah. but unfit parents don't lose their custody until they lose their enabling network and right now? you're part of that.", "If you can communicate through email and text.  \n\nMy husband and I have children who are disabled and ee have learned when you are communicating with difficult situations.

I'm not following.", "But what is the purpose of your argument? Is it to shame her - what benefit would that have? Is it to express that you need your own time and she needs to start taking care of him - then pointing out she has been shit mom so far might not be the best way to achieve that.

You need to put up a boundary and let your sister learn how to take care of her son, you cannot helicopter around and swoop up when she isn't doing as well as you would be, because then she would never learn. \n\nYou either want your time back or you want to take over all the care for the child.
