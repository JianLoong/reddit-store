Furthermore, this my first time writing a proper reddit comment, so I also apologize for any errors when it comes to formatting.This is going to be very unpopular, but YTA. Not because you're a bad aunt or anything, but because yes, you did cross a line.Your sister is totally justified in setting a spending limit on birthday gifts and I think it's kind of weird that you went all out on a birthday of a child that isn't even yours. Especially when you yourself said that you are always short on money. It doesn't seem like you're genuinely happy to buy gifts, it feels like a thinly veiled attempt at one-upping your sister.However, What really rubbed me the wrong way was this sentence:>After nine months of me caring for him while she lounged around and relaxed she finally wanted her son.In an afterthought you then clarified that your sister had post natal depression, something that should have been mentioned from the get-go. Yet you didn't, and instead chose to make your sister look like a complete ass for not caring for her son and being a neglectful mother. This sentence made me think that you are full of poo, OP, because what the hell? Your sister had post natal depression, she didn't chose to willy nilly throw her child away. She might have been soothed off of meds after three months, but just because she didn't take meds anymore doesn't mean she wasn't still effected by what happened. It was nice of you to step up when your nephew needed you, but throwing your sister under the bus like that was just unnecessary. It's not like she chose to get post natal depression.You seem to love your nephew a lot, which is a very nice thing, but he is not your child. You may have cared for him in the first few months after he was born *but he is simply not your child*. He's your nephew.>Recently these past months she\u2019s been pulling him away from me and not in a good way \\[...\\]What would be a \"good way\" for her to \"pull him away\" from you, OP? I am asking because I am genuinely curious. To me it sounds more like you think that, since you cared for your nephew because your sister had post natal depression that you're entitled to him and his affection now. Which you really, really aren't.This:>\\[...\\] it was only when we were out in the public that she did, she had to push his stroller, she had to get his car seat out ect ect. If I was seen with the baby she had to step in saying \u201cI want MY son back\u201d.and this:>\\[...\\]today I had a major arguement with her where she kept telling me \u201che\u2019s MY SON\u201d and my responses were \u201cI raised him for you for three fucking years\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done everything for him\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more of a mother to that boy than you have been. \u201c she called me a asshole and stormed off, grabbed **my nephew** and hid him from me.makes me think that your sister doesn't have the guts to stand up to you when at home. You have stated that you both live with your mother, whom you care for fulltime (Kudos for doing so, I know how hard it can be to care for an elderly person). My guess is that you have a much stronger position inside the household because of this than your sister, who \"fell pregnant\" without a father in the picture (at least you didn't mention one, but just like the post natal depression, he might have \"slipped your mind\"). She might have changed in the last few months and finally found the courage to stand up to you, obviously, since she started to \"Pull him away from you\".My question are: is your sister financially stable enough to move out? Your nephew is going to kindergarten, does that mean she has a job? If yes, how are her working times? Because if she takes him to kindergarten before work and brings him home during her lunch break, then this is conveniently something you have left out (again. Yes, I am very salty about that PS with her depression). It would also mean that you making his lunch and bathing him is only due to the fact that she is working. So you'd be sharing custodial work about equally, which does not entitle you to any \"aunty plus\" privileges.Your sister has started to set boundaries, which you repeatedly seemed to have broken and you are butthurt enough to upstage her on your nephew's birthday. Afterwards, when she rightfully got angry about it, you more or less told her that she hasn't been a good mother to him (AGAIN, she had depression!) and that you are a \"better\" mother, which you are not, you are his aunt.Your entire post reads as if you don't actually care about your nephew - you just want the world to applaud you for being an oh so self-sacrificing martyr who gets mistreated by her ungrateful sister. Everything you said carries a \"holier than though\"-attitude towards your sister, whom you seem to resent a ton for the past three years, and it looks like you want to use your nephew's love either as a compensation (\"I cared for him, now I am owed his love more than my sister is!\") or as leverage against your sister. Either way, it seems like the only person you really care for is yourself and the narrative of you being the perfect aunt and caretaker. And for that YTA\n\n\\[Edit because of typo\\]", "NTA. Difficult situation. Shitty mother and great aunt...
