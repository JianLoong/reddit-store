I've never stayed at a friend's rental where it wasn't a group thing either though.  Like the OP in this post, it's usually \"I'm going to be at my beach house during x dates, wanna join?\"", "$400 - 25% = $300", "NTA\n\nThat's not how this usually works.\n\nIf you are the one asking to rent a friend's property, then you should be the one paying for it - they may choose to give you a cheaper friends rate, but when you are the one choosing to stay and are preventing them from earning any income from another tenant it is only fair you cover the costs.\n\nIf they are the one asking you to stay, the expectation is that they are covering the cost of the rental themselves, and you being there is not costing them any extra (barring a nominal cost in extra utilities). Good etiquette would say that paying for some groceries or drinks is generally a suitable thanks.\n\nThem asking you to stay, then charging your rent comes across as a pretty poor move on their part - they are choosing the location and costs with no input from you or your preferences, and it seems that they are just using you to subsidise their stay.\n\nI would also be considering how much they are trying to charge you - if they are staying there too then if you were willing to pay you shouldn't be paying any more than half as you would be splitting the costs with them, and less again if you are providing any labour or other help and paying for your stay in man hours. If they are wanting to charge you full price, that means you get the full property to yourself, and can take advantage of any amenities and services (cleaning for example) that are offered...\n\nIf you don't want to pay (and I wouldn't) I see no shame or rudeness in just apologising and saying that you didn't budget for the additional rent costs, and will have to decline the offer of the trip.", "Going against the grain here a bit to say NAH. \n\n>There was no discussion about any of us needing to pay anything other than chipping in for food.\n\nRespectfully, based on what this and the rest of your post says EVERYONE had over five months to discuss things and confirm by text or whatever what would be expected of you as his cabin guests. And none of you made that happen. \n\nIt sounds everyone made assumptions--your friend thought you were aware a fee would be forthcoming and would see the 25% off as a great deal, you thought you were getting a nearly free week of cabin time. \n\nIt depends on what the rest of your friendship looks like, but personally I would let him know you can't make it because you weren't aware there would be fees beyond chipping in for food, and that next time this sort of thing comes up you'll get clear on expectations earlier. \n\nHopefully your friend will understand everyone kind of goofed up and let it go, and you'll all do better next time.
