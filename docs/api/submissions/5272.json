Honestly, it sucks you hurt your dad's feelings, so, next time, try to explain as best you can why he shouldn't cheap out, or if he doesn't want to spend the extra money, just give you some cash towards what you want.

Ended up just buying the damn thing myself.", "NTA\n\nYou were given a gift that was defective (by the very nature of the gift you were given), why wouldn't you return it instead of throwing it away?\n\nWhat does your father expect you to do?

My husband loved the lights but not the price so he did the rest of the house with cheap hardware from China, Ikea etc and has spent literally hundreds of hours fiddling with it. Some of what he has built is quite good but it's noticeably less stable than the hue system and the interface isn't as slick. I would replace it all with hue if I was the one maintaining it.", "YTA\n\nIf you want name brand things, buy them yourself.", "I asked for a certain model and certain brand.

I'll give her suggestions for an item I want within her price range and she'll buy a cheaper alternative that doesn't fit what I want and buy something else to go with it. She seems to take pride in being thrifty but it's not really a present if it isn't useful to you.

How you approach it all decides if you're the AH.", "So if you know he does this, why did you still ask him to get you these specific bulbs, and then still get mad when he got you the Chinese crap? \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards YTA just for that alone.", "If you need to complain about a gift on Reddit given from your father, I don't know what to say.

Do we know the the price of the product? These are hard times and sometimes there are people who take the cheaper route.

I was hoping to speak to a lightbulbs craftsman", "Yea it was an $80 pack of 2 Hue bulbs I asked for, for my new apartment\n\nHe bought a $17 pack of 3 bulbs from some company that\u2019s app and firmware is glitchy and has broken English everywhere.", "He could have afforded something 3x more.\n\nHe\u2019s very well off", "I never said I need to complain what my dad got me on Reddit. I personally care about the thought behind the gift rather than the value. But if you keep giving someone gifts that you know are broken, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very thoughtful. \n\nWhether that needs to be posted on Reddit is a completely different question. But then again who are we to decide what should be posted on this sub as long it doesn\u2019t break the rules and the MODs don\u2019t have a problem with it.\n\nI don\u2019t think the OP was lecturing their dad although obviously we don\u2019t know exactly what was said so I could be completely wrong. There\u2019s a difference between not being unhappy that you didn\u2019t get everything you wanted and/or you didn\u2019t get nice things and being unhappy that your loved ones keep getting gifts for you that they know are broken and doesn\u2019t work at all especially if you give thoughtful gifts in return (but idk what OP gifts their father)", "Gonna say NTA based on this. This hardware comes loaded with firmware and works with software. Even if the cheap hardware can function as intended, which is probably what your dad thought, the quality of the firmware and experience of the software matters in the overall experience.\n\nJust like with a computer, hardware may be just as good but if the controls and menus make no sense, you're not gonna enjoy using it.", "[deleted]", "If he keeps giving you gifts that are knockoff, why is it so shocking when he does it? You would think you would learn if he has a history of doing it.", "See my other comment in this thread", "Sorry I accidentally posted my previous reply before fully finishing it so I have edited it. \n\nJust because someone keeps doing something, doesn\u2019t make it less inconsiderate. In fact repetition makes it more thoughtless and maybe OP finally had enough of ignoring it and is frustrated that her dad just doesn\u2019t care if his gifts are broken and completely faulty especially if OP puts a lot of thought into their gifts. It\u2019s possible to spend very little on a gift (if you are financially struggling) but still buy something functional that\u2019s fit for purpose. You can even handmake something yourself which I always did for friends when I was younger and had no money\n\nLook I would never complain to the person about a gift even if it\u2019s broken because that comes across as ungrateful but I would silently think it\u2019s inconsiderate if they knew it was broken yet they gave it to me anyway. But I would inform the person that the gift is broken and we should get it returned because they spend their hard earned money on something that doesn\u2019t work! I mean if I gave someone a toy or an electronic device or whatever and it doesn\u2019t work at all I would want to know and I would want to get a return asap. \n\nIf your product is faulty you should definitely get a return, you are 100% entitled to a refund. Pretending that it works and you are completely happy with it, helps no one. It helps the seller get away with scamming people.", "I am guessing your dad is \"my personality is thrifty\" and frankly it's annoying. I had a family member that would occasionally do this. The problem is it's not thrifty and it doesn't save money. He will buy the cheaper version of things and replace them over and over and over until he's spent 5x what we just wanted in the first place.\n\nHe got you an unworking version of something you asked for \"to save money\" his brain will not process he's not saved money, he's gotten you an unworking burden that you are going to have to keep replacing or spend the extra \"he saved\" buying the working version.\n\nI don't know what advice to give because some people just will never see it for what it is. But you aren't TA \n\nNTA", "NTA", "That\u2019s so frustrating. I\u2019d rather have nothing. Because what\u2019s the point of giving someone a list of the specific things you\u2019d like if they end up getting you something else entirely. It\u2019s like asking for a dog and getting a cat and them saying \u2018well they\u2019re both animals.\u2019", "It's probably annoying as OP gives sound gifts and receives knockoffs that don't work or resemble the asked for gift. It would make more sense for the buyer to just say \"I'm not getting you that\" then present them with a broken item and expect to be praised for it on the level that the genuine article would have been. I've no beef with similar items as long as they work but knowingly giving broken ones is just sad.\n\nReally, when it comes to gift giving it IS the thought that counts, and in this case, if yours strapped for cash explain that, and if you're stingy please find a GOOD alternative - don't half arse whilst accepting a bunch of decent thoughtful gifts in return.", "I don't know a father who would tell his kids if he could afford it or not. How do you know the OP gives sound gifts? It wasn't mentioned.", "Mine did.", "First he doesn't know the gift is faulty, I am sure he isn't as experienced as the OP. Second it isn't broken and I didn't say they couldn't return it. It's faulty because it is a knockoff, and when you have something you want, any fault is more than you want to deal with.  \n\n\nI have experience in this as my father is the same way. Yet I learnt the hard way that there is some things he will not cheap out on, and usually ask for that. Sorry I was never spoiled so I couldn't imagine getting upset it wasn't exactly what I wanted. If it was so important, I would have told them that it needs to be exactly this one, and even a cash gift to get it would be more helpful.   \n\n\nThe rest of this makes no sense as I was not even talking about it."]}
