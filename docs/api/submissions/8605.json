Your passing them down as a heirloom which as of right now, are still yours. To do with what you like. So your daughter can't be upset about that. \nIt's like inheriting a house, can't just kick them out to demand it there and then", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you have a conversation with your daughter prior to the wedding about loaning the pearls?", "NTA and I would have a discussion with her about selfishness and entitlement. Loaning them for a special occasion didn\u2019t hurt her one bit so it seems something bigger might be going on here. (Or maybe teenaged girls can just be irrational, pissy and entitled sometimes and it\u2019s better to roll with the punches.)", "NTA umm they are yours not your daughters until you give them to her. Why she feels entitled to say what you do with them in the meantime is beyond me.", "NTA. They are YOUR pearls. You can do with them what you want. You don\u2019t have to gift them to your daughter in the future, you\u2019re doing it out of the kindness of your heart. But they are not currently hers to dictate who wears and who doesn\u2019t. They are not currently her property.", "My dad promised me I will get his house when he dies. \n\nHe didn't bother to ask me when he decided to remodel. He wouldn't ask me if he decided to sell it. \n\nI wouldn't ask him to either. \n\n\nThere's no difference. You need to teach your daughter the importance of sharing and not being entitled.

And I do think you should have just mentioned it to your daughter before loaning them out. What would have happened if something happened to them?

If it was me, I\u2019d tell her she\u2019s not getting them until I die now. She\u2019s greedy.", "NTA, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have hurt to say something to your daughter before the wedding. She\u2019s also only 17 and if memory serves, teenage girls aren\u2019t the most level headed. She\u2019ll probably get over it.", "NTA", "I think NAH\nOf course these are your pearls and you have the right to share them as you see fit.\nI think that maybe your daughter was afraid that pearls might get lost or destroyed during ceremony.

As you said, those are your pearls and you intend to abide to your promise of giving them to her in the future. If you had sold them or gifted them to your SIL, I may have agreed that you were the AH but you didn't. NTA, your daughter is acting like a spoiled child.", "NTA\n\nPearls are not hers yet. She is not entitled to them, and you can do whatever you want to do with them. In fact, you can even change your mind about giving her YOUR pearls.\n\nIf I were you, I'd keep them till I die, and just borrow them to her if she asks nicely, and not compromise by giving them to her earlier just because she feels entitled to your property.", "NTA- they're yours until you give them to your daughter. \nAlso it's quite sweet that your daughter in law wore them as a one off for her wedding as they are a family heirloom. Your daughter sounds a bit entitled to be hurt by it.", "NTA, homie would not be getting these pearls until my deathbed if it were my daughter hehehe", "I really seem to have a different view from the majority, and yup, it's due to my own thing, but here it is anyway.\n\nYTA\n\nWhen I was growing up, I expected to wear my mom's wedding dress & veil for my wedding (or at least the veil, which also had an antique comb from my grandmother attached). Mom even let me try it all on. \n\nThen her favorite niece (my cousin) asked if she could wear it for her wedding, and my mom was so flattered, she said yes. I was devastated that it hadn't been held for me, even though it wasn't \"mine\". \n\nThen my cousin had a DV incident where she died. My mother ended up burning her dress & veil, which I absolutely understood. It was tainted, there was no way to separate the memories, and I wouldn't have wanted to wear it anymore. But still, there was nothing left for me for my wedding from my mom's wedding (I ended up wearing a brooch she wore to her HS graduation as my something borrowed/something blue). \n\nYour daughter is looking at those pearls as an heirloom to be handed down in the direct line. You told her she was going to get them at 21. That really sounds like you are holding them in trust for her, particularly if you aren't wearing them yourself (and you said yourself that the only reason you held them was to keep them from being stolen by your ex). No, they're not \"hers\" yet, but from her point of view, they're being specially held for her, and now you've made them less of a direct connection from her grandmother to her mother to her. \n\nI do see where you're coming from that they do still legally belong to you, etc, but you should have asked your daughter, and respected her opinion about it. You could have found something else of yours to let your DIL wear.", "NTA. I think having your mom being a part of your son\u2019s wedding is beautiful. It\u2019s a shame your daughter couldn\u2019t appreciate that. I know she\u2019s just a teenager, but her attitude about this and saying she doesn\u2019t trust you is very nasty.", "NTA", "YTA because it should have been a conversation. I don't understand how it wasn't even brought up as a nice thing at some point before the wedding?? I'm sure she would have been fine if she knew ahead of time - having to work it out herself and ask if it was the same pearls is more than likely why she's upset. It wouldn't even have needed to be asking permission, or even formally letting her know - it just feels like a secret if it's not even talked about.", "Yta\n\nThose are HER pearls. You are just safekeeping them.\nYou told her they were hers, so why are you surprised she wanted to be asked permission before you loan them to someone???\n\nGrow up", "I say ISH. I understand that it is currently yours but you should've still asked for her opinion also. You promised her something to which she has agreed to wait a few years for. Then without asking for her opinion you let someone else use what she was promised and was also waiting on. You need to understand this conflict with trust. I'm sure anyone in her position would feel some feelings of betrayal.", "NTA Until she turns twenty one, they dont belong to her.", "See I agree your NTA\n\nBut talking to her first most probably would have helped she 17 hormones are rife.\n\nHowever people are attacking your daughter character in the comments saying she is spoiled etc \nYour not defending her even if she is \nShe still young and you literally thrown her under the bus on Reddit \n\nLet\u2019s hope she or her friends don\u2019t see this and she sees some of the comments", "Yeah: I was thinking the same thing, OP should really re-assess the whole thing about giving them over just because she's 18.", "The way she interpreted the conversation we had a few years ago was \"these are yours, but I'm keeping them in trust for you until you are old enough to care for them\" when what I actually said was more along the lines of \"my mom would want me to pass these on to you, and I will when you turn 21.\"", "Why would she?

How can it be a secret when the bride is wearing them? It's ridiculous to think she has to ask permission. NTA", "They\u2019re **not** her pearls; they belong to OP. They\u2019ve just been promised to the daughter in a future that is not here yet.", "That's not how inheritance works.", "Anyone in her position would not feel the same. I would feel like the pearls carry even more of my family's history and be honored they were shared.", "That sounds like pretty much the same thing to me, especially if you don't wear them.", "What?\n\nThe daughter isn't owed the pearls at a particular age. The mother could also decide to leave her daughter nothing in her will.\n\nChildren do not have an automatic right to their parents' property.\n\nThis has nothing to do with parenting", "then me what? (:", "Like I said, she doesn't have to ask permission, but I don't understand how you could get all the way to the wedding without talking to your daughter about the heirloom pearls being worn at the wedding. It just seems a mad thing to not even mention in passing? And I think if I was in the daughter's position I'd be confused about why I didn't know they were being lent out until after the fact. She does have a vested interest in what happens to the pearls, even if she doesn't get a say.", "'i told her that she will get the pearls when she's 21'.. 'i won't give her them now cuz her father will take them'\n\n\nSo they're hers and she's just safekeeping them.", "Unless this was a tradition they already do, I can understand that. If this was the first time, the father should've let his daughter know first.", "Yeah, that's the foundation of our argument. It's not a huge difference, so it's easy to misinterpret.", "What would be the reason to talk to her about it? The purpose of an heirloom is to share it with family and pass it down at the appropriate time. She has no implied ownership until that time comes.", "What part of that's not how inheritance works was difficult to understand?\n\"I told her that she will get the pearls when she's 21.\" She's not 21 yet. \"I won't give them to her now cuz her father will take them.\" Meaning they haven't been given yet. Meaning they aren't hers yet.\n\nI'm gonna give my kid my mustang when he's 21.\nHe's not 21 yet. Not old enough to drive. Car isn't his until I put his name on the title.\nSame concept. Not hers too decide how it's used.", "Because the daughter would be interested to know and it's a nice thing to talk about. Why *wouldn't* you talk about it??"]}
