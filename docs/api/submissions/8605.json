You don\u2019t have to gift them to your daughter in the future, you\u2019re doing it out of the kindness of your heart. But they are not currently hers to dictate who wears and who doesn\u2019t.

Your daughter sounds a bit entitled to be hurt by it.", "NTA, homie would not be getting these pearls until my deathbed if it were my daughter hehehe", "I really seem to have a different view from the majority, and yup, it's due to my own thing, but here it is anyway.\n\nYTA\n\nWhen I was growing up, I expected to wear my mom's wedding dress & veil for my wedding (or at least the veil, which also had an antique comb from my grandmother attached). Mom even let me try it all on. \n\nThen her favorite niece (my cousin) asked if she could wear it for her wedding, and my mom was so flattered, she said yes. I was devastated that it hadn't been held for me, even though it wasn't \"mine\". \n\nThen my cousin had a DV incident where she died. My mother ended up burning her dress & veil, which I absolutely understood. It was tainted, there was no way to separate the memories, and I wouldn't have wanted to wear it anymore. But still, there was nothing left for me for my wedding from my mom's wedding (I ended up wearing a brooch she wore to her HS graduation as my something borrowed/something blue). \n\nYour daughter is looking at those pearls as an heirloom to be handed down in the direct line. You told her she was going to get them at 21. That really sounds like you are holding them in trust for her, particularly if you aren't wearing them yourself (and you said yourself that the only reason you held them was to keep them from being stolen by your ex). No, they're not \"hers\" yet, but from her point of view, they're being specially held for her, and now you've made them less of a direct connection from her grandmother to her mother to her. \n\nI do see where you're coming from that they do still legally belong to you, etc, but you should have asked your daughter, and respected her opinion about it. You could have found something else of yours to let your DIL wear.", "NTA. I think having your mom being a part of your son\u2019s wedding is beautiful.

I'm sure she would have been fine if she knew ahead of time - having to work it out herself and ask if it was the same pearls is more than likely why she's upset.

I understand that it is currently yours but you should've still asked for her opinion also. You promised her something to which she has agreed to wait a few years for.

They are your pearls and I agree that your mother would have loved the fact that she was involved in your sons wedding, but I understand where your daughter is coming from. My mom had a pair of gold leaf earring with pearls on them that my father gave her. I knew they were to be mine when I turned 21. When my brother and SIL got married my SIL wore them as her something borrowed. I thought she looked beautiful in them and it meant A LOT to my brother, but I was young (about your daughters age) and I was jealous that my SIL wore them. Back then I somehow thought that the fact that my mom let my SIL wear them meant that she was somehow closer to my SIL than to me and that my SIL was going to take my place with my mom. As an adult I now know that isn\u2019t the case and that it was just a tradition (something borrowed) that my mom was helping my SIL with and also doing something nice for my brother. Your daughter is likely just feeling a little jealous.", "NTA. I was honestly expecting that your dil was refusing to return the pearls. But that wasn\u2019t the case.

Your mom would want you to wear them rather than just keeping them safe for your daughter. Your daughter is being unreasonable, greedy, demanding. Keep the pearls. Wear the pearls. That the best way to honor your Mom. Leave them in your will to your daughter. Tell her you\u2019ve rethought the entire gifting of the pearls. I have 5 daughters. If one of them acted like this I would give the pearls to a different daughter. Again, they are your pearls to do with as you please. As the advice goes, don\u2019t throw your pearls before swine!", "NAH but poor communication. I can see her being upset thinking they're hers and you're just keeping them safe though you could have given them to her and kept them at your house so ex couldn't get them so that's a poor reasoning to me. I'd be upset if someone lent something I thought was mine without asking. You had a different arrangement in your mind.", "YTA,  while they are technically yours, you have promised them to her, and she has formed an attachment to them  and you disregarded her feelings because you didn't discuss it with her first.  Being right, and being kind are not the same thing.", "Your daughter\u2019s behavior is quite entitled.  She is acting spoiled.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter sounds like a selfish entitled brat tbh.\n\nHaving a family heirloom as a wedding day loan is pretty standard and a beautiful thing to do.\n\nDon't think your daughter should get the pearls at all with the way she has behaved.", "And that, friends, is why we don't tell people that they will eventually be getting things. Jewelry, inheritance, whatever. Don't let that hang over someone's head.", "I can understand your daughter's frustration. If DIL had lost the pearls or broken them, then what.  Your daughter would have never had the chance to wear them and enjoy them the way she dreams of.", "Nah, I get everyone who is saying your daughter is immature but as a daughter who\u2019s been promised things, let me give you the other side. When you have been promised something, especially at that age, you see it as something that will be yours and because it isn\u2019t in use, you see it as yours. Your daughter isn\u2019t immature, she\u2019s just possessive. I think it could have been avoided if you told her your intention rather than just given it without a word. She sees you as keeping it for her, yes she is entitled but it\u2019s not entitlement that came from nowhere. She views them as someone would view a family car that would be given to their child, or a trust fund. She views the pearls to be FOR HER, which is what you told her. She isn\u2019t wrong, there was just a miscommunication. Maybe you spoke about it once and she thinks you forgot about it, or changed your mind. So that\u2019s why she is upset. I dont think you should give it to her later in life as you would be going against your own word. Give them to her when she was promised but for now emphasise the part that it\u2019s a family thing. Yes they are hers in name, but the meaning of them is the most important part. They are a connector to her family and the fact that her sister in law wore them is actually using them as should be used. Try emphasise that it\u2019s something to connect your family and that eventually she will share it to the next generation or to someone in the family. I think you need to be more empathetic to her feelings and she needs to view it, not as a piece of jewellery but as a connector. And she needs to know that that was the intention, when you decided to hand it to her", "NTA. Sounds a bit like your daughter is spoiled. What does she mean that she doesn\u2019t trust you with them? They are yours until YOU decide to pass them to her.", "NTA but your daughter is definitely over that line.  Honestly, when she demanded them because she \"didn't trust me\" I'd have wrapped them in gift paper and given them to my daughter in law as a belated wedding gift.", "NTA. As someone who has been stung in the past with things promised to me then given to other people, I think your daughter is just worried you might give them away before she gets them. Pearls are a beautiful reminder of her mom.", "NTA. DIL asked to borrow them and returned promptly after. They are your pearls until daughter turns 21 therefore they\u2019re yours to do with as you wish.", "NTA. They\u2019re still yours. \n\nAnd honestly it sounds like the daughter isn\u2019t mature enough to have them either.", "NTA\n\nYou said she will inherit it at 21. That\u2019s that.\n\nAre you sure she\u2019s ready to have it at 18? She won\u2019t hear it now but you may save her regret\u2026talk to her?", "NTA\n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t lower the age that you give the pearls to your daughter, since she\u2019s demonstrated so little maturity thus far\n\nIf you give them to her at 18, don\u2019t be surprised is she ends up selling \u2018her\u2019 pearls \n\nYour daughter should be the one apologizing for seemingly trying to ruin a nice moment between you and your DIL", "NTA and your daughter is not adult enough to manage a family heirloom. Should reassess whether she actually deserves and will appreciate them.", "NTA  and I had to laugh that your daughter no longer trusts you with your own property. You migh want to explain once more that the pearls are not hers til you choose to give them and then leave it alone.

I hope she doesn't intend on bringing the pearls to college or wherever else she's going once she graduates", "NTA.  She seems entitled AF and selfish.", "Does she like your DIL?

NTA", "Agreed. I'd absolutely reconsider gifting these pearls after this attitude.  She doesn't trust op with them? Wtf?", "[removed]", "My guess without knowing?  She's ticked off because she wants to wear the pearls to her own wedding, and SIL having \"beaten her to it\" and not being a direct descendant of Grandma will make them less special.", "It\u2019s especially weird that the DIL wants the pearls of someone else\u2019s grandmother.

She also didn\u2019t mention it at the wedding, presumably not to make a scene, but by the time she got a chance to ask, her emotions had festered, and she had a somewhat immature (but still not all that terrible) reaction to the explanation. \n\nI know people are going to disagree with me on this.

If you had leant them out without telling her, they got lost or irreparably damaged in some way (not with any malicious intent, but because stuff happens), and you had to tell her that she couldn\u2019t have them anymore because of that, I imagine the reactions to this thread would be pretty different.

Seeing it at the wedding was definitely a shock that caused her to react somewhat emotionally.", "Saying she \"doesn't trust\" mom with them anymore tells me she thinks of them as hers.  Mom is just holding them for her,  in her mind.  That's the excessive entitlement here.  The pearls belong to mom.  Mom gets to decide what to do with them until she hands them over.  There's nothing to trust here,  because mom is managing her own property.", "Maybe the daughter thinks that they're technically hers and her mother is just keeping them safe for her, rather than that they actually belong to her mother and will be hers some day.  I guess it depends on what kind of language has been used in the past when talking about the pearls.", "She likely didn\u2019t want to cause a scene at the wedding or bother them on their honeymoon, which in any other thread, people would be agreeing is the right move. That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t care; she clearly does.", "You okay, dude? You sound unhinged about a relatively minor issue. Taking everything to an extreme can\u2019t be good for your blood pressure.", "That should have all been nullified when OP clarified as stated in the post. Instead of saying \u201cmy bad I thought they were mine already and you were keeping them safe\u201d she said \u201cI don\u2019t trust you with them anymore\u201d despite having been made clear they do not belong to her yet.", "My blood pressure is fine lol. You\u2019re super manipulative though.", "I\u2019m going to express doubt. Again with the aggression and character attacks.", "Your username is very funny and appropriate \ud83d\ude02", "I only responded in the same manner I was addressed. If you don\u2019t want to be called manipulative, don\u2019t call someone unhinged with literally zero evidence as such. Am I ranting incoherently? Using all caps? Exclamation points?\n\nTrust me, I have a lot less flattering opinions after our brief exchange, but I\u2019m keeping them to myself because you\u2019re not worth my time."]}
