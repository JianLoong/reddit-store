You don\u2019t have to gift them to your daughter in the future, you\u2019re doing it out of the kindness of your heart. But they are not currently hers to dictate who wears and who doesn\u2019t.

Your daughter sounds a bit entitled to be hurt by it.", "NTA, homie would not be getting these pearls until my deathbed if it were my daughter hehehe", "I really seem to have a different view from the majority, and yup, it's due to my own thing, but here it is anyway.\n\nYTA\n\nWhen I was growing up, I expected to wear my mom's wedding dress & veil for my wedding (or at least the veil, which also had an antique comb from my grandmother attached). Mom even let me try it all on. \n\nThen her favorite niece (my cousin) asked if she could wear it for her wedding, and my mom was so flattered, she said yes. I was devastated that it hadn't been held for me, even though it wasn't \"mine\". \n\nThen my cousin had a DV incident where she died. My mother ended up burning her dress & veil, which I absolutely understood. It was tainted, there was no way to separate the memories, and I wouldn't have wanted to wear it anymore. But still, there was nothing left for me for my wedding from my mom's wedding (I ended up wearing a brooch she wore to her HS graduation as my something borrowed/something blue). \n\nYour daughter is looking at those pearls as an heirloom to be handed down in the direct line. You told her she was going to get them at 21. That really sounds like you are holding them in trust for her, particularly if you aren't wearing them yourself (and you said yourself that the only reason you held them was to keep them from being stolen by your ex). No, they're not \"hers\" yet, but from her point of view, they're being specially held for her, and now you've made them less of a direct connection from her grandmother to her mother to her. \n\nI do see where you're coming from that they do still legally belong to you, etc, but you should have asked your daughter, and respected her opinion about it. You could have found something else of yours to let your DIL wear.", "NTA. I think having your mom being a part of your son\u2019s wedding is beautiful.

I'm sure she would have been fine if she knew ahead of time - having to work it out herself and ask if it was the same pearls is more than likely why she's upset.

I understand that it is currently yours but you should've still asked for her opinion also. You promised her something to which she has agreed to wait a few years for.

They are your pearls and I agree that your mother would have loved the fact that she was involved in your sons wedding, but I understand where your daughter is coming from. My mom had a pair of gold leaf earring with pearls on them that my father gave her. I knew they were to be mine when I turned 21. When my brother and SIL got married my SIL wore them as her something borrowed. I thought she looked beautiful in them and it meant A LOT to my brother, but I was young (about your daughters age) and I was jealous that my SIL wore them. Back then I somehow thought that the fact that my mom let my SIL wear them meant that she was somehow closer to my SIL than to me and that my SIL was going to take my place with my mom. As an adult I now know that isn\u2019t the case and that it was just a tradition (something borrowed) that my mom was helping my SIL with and also doing something nice for my brother. Your daughter is likely just feeling a little jealous.", "NTA. I was honestly expecting that your dil was refusing to return the pearls. But that wasn\u2019t the case.

Your mom would want you to wear them rather than just keeping them safe for your daughter. Your daughter is being unreasonable, greedy, demanding. Keep the pearls. Wear the pearls. That the best way to honor your Mom. Leave them in your will to your daughter. Tell her you\u2019ve rethought the entire gifting of the pearls. I have 5 daughters. If one of them acted like this I would give the pearls to a different daughter. Again, they are your pearls to do with as you please. As the advice goes, don\u2019t throw your pearls before swine!", "NAH but poor communication. I can see her being upset thinking they're hers and you're just keeping them safe though you could have given them to her and kept them at your house so ex couldn't get them so that's a poor reasoning to me. I'd be upset if someone lent something I thought was mine without asking. You had a different arrangement in your mind.", "YTA,  while they are technically yours, you have promised them to her, and she has formed an attachment to them  and you disregarded her feelings because you didn't discuss it with her first.  Being right, and being kind are not the same thing.", "Your daughter\u2019s behavior is quite entitled.  She is acting spoiled.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter sounds like a selfish entitled brat tbh.\n\nHaving a family heirloom as a wedding day loan is pretty standard and a beautiful thing to do.\n\nDon't think your daughter should get the pearls at all with the way she has behaved.", "And that, friends, is why we don't tell people that they will eventually be getting things. Jewelry, inheritance, whatever. Don't let that hang over someone's head.", "I can understand your daughter's frustration. If DIL had lost the pearls or broken them, then what.  Your daughter would have never had the chance to wear them and enjoy them the way she dreams of.", "Nah, I get everyone who is saying your daughter is immature but as a daughter who\u2019s been promised things, let me give you the other side. When you have been promised something, especially at that age, you see it as something that will be yours and because it isn\u2019t in use, you see it as yours. Your daughter isn\u2019t immature, she\u2019s just possessive. I think it could have been avoided if you told her your intention rather than just given it without a word. She sees you as keeping it for her, yes she is entitled but it\u2019s not entitlement that came from nowhere. She views them as someone would view a family car that would be given to their child, or a trust fund. She views the pearls to be FOR HER, which is what you told her. She isn\u2019t wrong, there was just a miscommunication. Maybe you spoke about it once and she thinks you forgot about it, or changed your mind. So that\u2019s why she is upset. I dont think you should give it to her later in life as you would be going against your own word. Give them to her when she was promised but for now emphasise the part that it\u2019s a family thing. Yes they are hers in name, but the meaning of them is the most important part. They are a connector to her family and the fact that her sister in law wore them is actually using them as should be used. Try emphasise that it\u2019s something to connect your family and that eventually she will share it to the next generation or to someone in the family. I think you need to be more empathetic to her feelings and she needs to view it, not as a piece of jewellery but as a connector. And she needs to know that that was the intention, when you decided to hand it to her", "NTA. Sounds a bit like your daughter is spoiled. What does she mean that she doesn\u2019t trust you with them? They are yours until YOU decide to pass them to her.", "NTA but your daughter is definitely over that line.  Honestly, when she demanded them because she \"didn't trust me\" I'd have wrapped them in gift paper and given them to my daughter in law as a belated wedding gift.", "NTA. As someone who has been stung in the past with things promised to me then given to other people, I think your daughter is just worried you might give them away before she gets them. Pearls are a beautiful reminder of her mom.", "NTA. DIL asked to borrow them and returned promptly after. They are your pearls until daughter turns 21 therefore they\u2019re yours to do with as you wish.", "NTA. They\u2019re still yours. \n\nAnd honestly it sounds like the daughter isn\u2019t mature enough to have them either.", "NTA\n\nYou said she will inherit it at 21. That\u2019s that.\n\nAre you sure she\u2019s ready to have it at 18? She won\u2019t hear it now but you may save her regret\u2026talk to her?", "NTA\n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t lower the age that you give the pearls to your daughter, since she\u2019s demonstrated so little maturity thus far\n\nIf you give them to her at 18, don\u2019t be surprised is she ends up selling \u2018her\u2019 pearls \n\nYour daughter should be the one apologizing for seemingly trying to ruin a nice moment between you and your DIL", "NTA and your daughter is not adult enough to manage a family heirloom. Should reassess whether she actually deserves and will appreciate them.", "NTA  and I had to laugh that your daughter no longer trusts you with your own property. You migh want to explain once more that the pearls are not hers til you choose to give them and then leave it alone.

I hope she doesn't intend on bringing the pearls to college or wherever else she's going once she graduates", "NTA.  She seems entitled AF and selfish.", "Does she like your DIL?

NTA", "Agreed. I'd absolutely reconsider gifting these pearls after this attitude.  She doesn't trust op with them? Wtf?", "[removed]", "My guess without knowing?  She's ticked off because she wants to wear the pearls to her own wedding, and SIL having \"beaten her to it\" and not being a direct descendant of Grandma will make them less special.", "It\u2019s especially weird that the DIL wants the pearls of someone else\u2019s grandmother.

She also didn\u2019t mention it at the wedding, presumably not to make a scene, but by the time she got a chance to ask, her emotions had festered, and she had a somewhat immature (but still not all that terrible) reaction to the explanation. \n\nI know people are going to disagree with me on this.

If you had leant them out without telling her, they got lost or irreparably damaged in some way (not with any malicious intent, but because stuff happens), and you had to tell her that she couldn\u2019t have them anymore because of that, I imagine the reactions to this thread would be pretty different.

Trust me, it may seem like you're doing okay because she isn't throwing tantrums but in reality it is teaching her that it's is okay to violate people's boundaries, that demanding things of her parents is okay (this is the really bad one because she will do the same to her lovers, family and strangers), that she is entitled to get whatever she wants whenever she wants and that using someone's emotions against them to manipulate them into doing what she wants is the way to get through life. \n\nIt is never too late to go to counseling.

I have a measly 100 dollars to show for what my grandad had specially designed for me, as a present for me entering the family, and as a warm gesture to honor me.

So, yeah, if baggage results from one of the only two times an item is worn, it makes sense that the item might seem a bit tainted. Your mom did an unusual thing and there were kind of unpredictable consequences to it.\n\nJewelry is jewelry. It's meant to be worn from time to time, particularly on special occasions. It doesn't tear or stain or inherently lose value through being worn. Jewelry is a great item to loan out. It's a common item to loan out. You're unlikely to see an item of jewelry that someone wore once and be flooded with memories of everything bad that happened to that person who wore it once--it's not like the wedding dress/veil, with its rather specific history.\n\nI'm not into jewelry myself. When I was young, my dad said I could have his car someday. Did that mean I got to dictate who drove it in the mean time? Or that it lived in a garage until the day it was mine? No. It's a car. It gets driven. Sometimes by people I didn't even know. It wasn't my car *until he gave it to me*. And it was mine for all of 6 months before having to say goodbye to it due mechanical issues, but do you think I blamed the issues on my dad for using his own car even though he promised it to me?

It's lovely as a \"borrowed\" item, but I can understand his daughter feeling off put by it.", "OP did a nice thing. \n\n17yo will get over it.", "My dad promised me his car when I was young. He kept driving it, adding to the wear and tear, sometimes even loaning it out to other people. I was attached to that car my whole life. I loved it. \n\nAnd you reckon my dad's a jerk for using the car he promised me? My parents must thank their lucky stars I'm not as entitled as OP's 17 year old. Wearing pearls once doesn't do nearly the sort of damage as driving a car 100,000 miles or so! They clearly should have bought another car and garaged that one. \n\nI can't believe I never realised how my father diminished the value of the \"trust\" he promised me so severely! /s", "OP at no point has mentioned putting the pearls in a trust. Your grasping. \n\nThe daughter is entirely in the wrong. The pearls are unambiguously not hers. Some day they will be. But currently they are not. And the owner of the pearls (i.e. OP) can do whatever they want with them", "Oof yeah sorry but YTA, that was something really special and it\u2019s been somewhat tarnished now. Family heirlooms are hard to come by and you\u2019ve ruined the connection to her grandmother that your daughter was going to have with it", "Yeah but a conversation with her wouldn\u2019t have hurt. He even acknowledged in a comment that this was all a misunderstanding over what he meant about her eventual ownership. Neither of them were in the wrong, but dismissing your kid\u2019s feelings is an ah move", "Sometimes children are greedy\u2026 they\u2019re people. They have human flaws.

She\u2019s perfectly capable of understanding what she did wrong.", "good thing I\u2019m never gonna be a parent then, imagine raising an entitled brat like that. no thank you and that\u2019s also why I made that joke (ever heard of jokes?) \n\nnonetheless, OP is clearly NTA and I love how people on reddit take themselves so seriously \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udef6", "17 is hardly a child.", "She might have been planning for a while to wear them at her wedding, and now feels like she would just be copying her SIL and that a special moment and tribute to her grandma was stolen by someone that either didn't know her or barely knew her.", "Actually, I do think that would be shitty. If someone is promised an heirloom or something of sentimental value from their parents, it is absolutely assholey for the parents to ruin the object promised before it can be passed on. If parents want to keep and use something that\u2019s sentimental, that\u2019s totally fine, no one *has* to give anything away, but don\u2019t put said item in a trust like situation. OP themselves admit daughter believes they are holding these earrings as a trust. Plenty of others assumed the same if you read the thread. It very much came off as \u201cThese are yours.

A trust is just the best way to explain what appears to be the daughter's perspective of the situation. \n\nIf the pearls have been effectively sitting in storage waiting for the daughter to turn 21 before now, it's not unreasonable that that's the impression she got.", "And your reaction to a minor misbehavior (that comes from a place of hurt feelings) is to be petty and vindictive? To your own child? You\u2019ll carry a grudge against your kid over a misunderstanding to the death? I sincerely hope you\u2019re not a parent\n\nShe wasn\u2019t greedy, she got attached to the necklace that\u2019s been promised to her. It\u2019s not a crime or greediness to believe that if something has been promised to be yours, no one else will use it before you, precisely because it\u2019s promised to you. They\u2019re still OP\u2019s, but where he went wrong was not discuss it with her, or just let her know what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s the considerate thing to do, especially to your own child, something you seem incapable of doing", "It\u2019s still his child, that he supposedly cares about", "And legally, yes, 17 is still a child. But if you wanna nuke your relationship with your kid, go for it", "They won\u2019t make it to the dorms are you kidding me \u201cThese stay with me until you\u2019re mature enough to deserve them\u201d is not being mean or unfair.

No, they belong to her mother who may one day pass them down but those pearls certainly aren't hers yet.", "She wasn\u2019t just hurt. She asked for them now because she \u201cdidn\u2019t trust\u201d her mom with her own property.", "Thank you! It sucks the most because it could have easily been prevented, but I didn't want her to scold me for being careless enough to drop it, and I let it literally blow up instead smh. I'm glad you have yours though. I know you'll cherish it forever.", "The comment that says a dress vs a necklace are two very different things dismisses the value of the necklace by implying it\u2019s less important but if you do not have your dead grandma\u2019s wedding dress her necklace will be a level of sentimental importance that a new dress will not have. It\u2019s just dumb to say it\u2019s different when there isn\u2019t even an heirloom dress involved here.", "The daughter's perspective is that the pearls are hers.

It\u2019s an emotion and she\u2019s not hurting anyone by feeling that way. She understood it one way since however long ago and it was clearly never properly discussed until now or else she wouldn\u2019t have misunderstood in the first place. She\u2019s allowed to feel annoyed about the situation not having been clear from the beginning. What is so wrong about her being mildly upset?", "Jesus lmao. She was told as a CHILD that they would be hers one day. God forbid a kid have a misunderstanding and then be miffed about the reality of the situation. She\u2019s not acting bratty at all. Having emotions isn\u2019t bratty, it\u2019s human. She didn\u2019t shout or demand or stomp her feet or snatch them away, she\u2019s just annoyed, which isn\u2019t a crime. Give teenagers the allowances you give yourself.", "That's kind of a confusing thing. I genuinely don't understand why OP even told the daughter that they would get the pearls until its time to pass them down? Maybe it's just me, but in my view when you promise something to someone, a certain sense of ownership is automatically transferred over. At that point no you don't own it anymore. You are merely the holding it. If you want to retain ownership, don't tell them the object is going to be theirs at a very specific point.", "Doesn't change it for me personally, they're still his to do whatever he wants with until he gives them away", "This 100%", "Thank you for bringing up the Mesopotamian city of Ur, otherwise Sumer, in modern day Iraq, about 140 km southeast of Babylon, 10 km from the Euphrates river, population 60,000 at around 4900 bc, making it one of the oldest cities known to man. Temples, canals, irrigation, astronomy, the first written language\u2014cuneiform\u2014and story, the epic of Gilgamesh, all from Ur! How fucking cool is that shit? It is very cool.\n\nOh, and everything you know of language comes originally from a pun, a misunderstanding, and a correction. A scratch in the sand. In a cave. Where two ancient people try to communicate. That\u2019s the amazing, endless fluidity and magnitude of language.\n\np.s I'm upvoting you so you'll maybe learn something instead of being knee-jerk stupid for the rest of your life.", "OP said the only reason he still has them is because he doesn't trust his ex to not take them and sell them. Being his mum's pearl necklace & an heirloom they are likely to be worth something.  \n\nSeems like the daughter thinks they were already hers, especially if OP has told her why the necklace isn't already, but OP is holding onto them until she's 21 instead of it being OP's property and their daughter has no claim.", ">What is so wrong about her being mildly upset?\n\nThat things have been explained to her and she still behaves like she's if the pearls are hers.\n\nThey are not.", "That\u2019s not excessive entitlement lol. She\u2019s seventeen. She understood it one way because it was clearly never clarified and is shocked that the conclusion she drew as an actual child turned out to be wrong.

If she had something of worth that I cared about that was to be given to me at some point, I'd ask her if I could have it sooner, and might well explain (she knows, really) why I didn't trust it would ever come to me if it stayed with her.  That wouldn't mean I didn't understand the ownership, just that there's little reason to believe it'd stay hers long enough that I'd ever actually receive it.  \n\nThat said, the daughter's being unreasonable about the circumstances here unless she e.g. knows the SIL to be unreliable about stuff like this.", ">she still behaves\n\nWhat is the behavior you're referencing? The last thing OP told us is \"She agreed to the compromise but is still miffed.\" Being miffed is not a behavior. it's an emotion and it's okay. She's not doing anything wrong, so again, what is the problem?", "How does asking OP if he lent the necklace out affect the honeymoon?", ">She asked if she could have them now because she doesn't trust me with them anymore.\n\nThis. Did you even read op?", "I misunderstood your original comment, my apologies.\n\nEven still: maybe she wanted to confirm that they were the same pearls before bringing it up to her dad, because while she does care about this, I doubt she\u2019s deliberately trying to start drama."]}
