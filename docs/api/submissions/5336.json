He dumped his kid for 6 years and then comes back....that doesn't make him anything BUT an amazing ASSHOLE! Then he is mad that you're not giving him toys that clearly don't belong to him and probably didn't pay for a dime, since he abandoned you and your child. Don't care if he came out gay.

But if he doesn't care what you do with them, then it's totally your right to save them for potential grandchildren.\n\nAlso, the fact that he wants those specific toys, when he likely has a boatload of money, means he's either super cheap, or, his parents aren't involved in his younger children's lives, and he thinks getting his hands on toys his parents purchased will somehow make up for their ruined relationship.

You don\u2019t need the toys, your son doesn\u2019t care. Your ex shouldn\u2019t be asking you to give him ANYTHING, but sounds like you wouldn\u2019t lose anything by giving him the toys. That said, after the way he replied to you when you said no I wouldn\u2019t give him ANYTHING.", "NTA.\n\nYour son said **you** could decide what to do with them, you decided you wanted to save them for grandkids if he chooses to have any, and if he doesn't, you can give them away then to charity or kids in need as you wish.\n\nEx isn't owed stuff that was never his because his kids could in theory use them. Especially because it could sour your relationships with his parents as they might be pretty unhappy for that stuff to go to the ex and you don't need needless drama like that. I wouldn't risk your better relationships for one that is already pretty iffy/shaky.", "Nah. The back story really isn't relevant. They were toys for your house.  It would be extremely generous of you to give them to your ex. But, it doesn't make you an ah for not giving them to him.  But keep in mind, your son may decide not to have kids, and then no one would have played with them. Which may be fine!

Even if you had a good relationship, he doesn't get to browse around your house like it's a shop and then take what he wants.\n\nTell him such, he needs to keep his eyes in his own head. If he wants to buy his kids toys he needs to go get them. He needs to mind his manners. And tell your husband that is well. It's a problem that your ex has the right to tell you that he wants stuff from your house, and you're the one who is going to be handling things with your ex", "Well, the toys were given to your son by his grandparents, so it\u2019s really not up to you what happens to them now.

Are the toys just sitting around collecting dust?\n\nThe toys served their purpose to your son. I'm sure some of those items have sentimental value, but I'm also sure some of those toys could go to a child who would appreciate them. \n\nYou don't have to give the toys away to your ex since you obviously hold some grudge... but have you considered maybe donating the toys to some kids who are less fortunate this time of year? Or are you worried they \"won't be as careful\"?", "So I'd ask myself if this was about more than the toys - since your son doesn't care about them and doesn't seem to want to pass them on. How many are there? You really can't part with a few for some other kids? \n\nHonestly, ESH. I'd feel differently if his parents didn't buy the toys. But your ex is an AH for pretending this is a way for his kids to connect to their half brother when he didn't care about him for multiple years, and you because you're hanging on to them out of what feels like spite.\n\nTake 2-4 of your favorites and squirrel them away, and then let him take a few of the others.", "ESH except for your son, for fighting over toys. I get that maybe the toys have emotional value for you, but they seem to have absolutely none for your son. You don't currently need the toys, your ex doesn't need the toys, your son isn't caught up on the toys, so what's the hang-up on these toys? Honestly, you should donate the toys and start fresh. Instead of sweet memories of your son to share with your possible future grandchildren, now those toys will represent how you won at being petty.", "YTA. This is petty and unbecoming.

He may say that he is not interested now but I wonder if he would get upset later on if you did give them to your ex because they were given to a man who didn't want him. Your ex and his partner can afford toys for their kids. You are in your right to keep them for your potential grandchildren or to donate them to a needy child if your son wants to be childless.", "NTA\n\nThey belong to your son and were gifts from his paternal grandparents.  Son told you to do what you wish.  You elected not to give them to his current children.\n\nLet ex and spouse buy toys; it's not your responsibility.\n\nGood Luck", "I\u2019m a little torn on this. On one hand, why bother asking him if your just going to keep them. On the other hand your ex was quite brazen asking for such a thing. However, in some ways, he does have a point. Perfectly good toys are just going to be sitting there, gathering dust, waiting for grandchildren in which there is no *real* guarantee you will actually get. I\u2019m sorry to say that but, that\u2019s the reality of life. \n\nMy mother had much the same thoughts, save some of my baby toys and clothes for any potential grandchildren, but still donate some so at least some can still be used right away. She kept more of the sentimental items or items that I held sentimental. Perhaps, you both could go through it and pick out what you want to keep and what you are willing to part with? He says do what you want now but he might change his mind about some things once he goes through them. There may be something he may even want his new little brother to have", "NTA.  \nRun down to Goodwill and buy some toys. Tell him to come pick them up. He was gone 6 years. Like he'd know the difference.", "NTA\nThe toys belong to you and your son.

Besides, those boys are family to your son. And your ex did come back around. Better than not. \nI just can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t put those kids first and think of their best interests, rather than tooting your own horn how right you are. So right, those kids don\u2019t get those toys!\n Bah Humbug on you!", "NTA let him buy his own toys", "NTA keep those toys for your grandbabies to enjoy. You don't suddenly go from forgetting you have a kid to being a great dad. He doesn't deserve them. If he wants his younger children to have those toys he can get his own.", "NTA. But just a word of advice.... I know a lot of people who don't want anything to do with their childhood toys and also would rather they go to good use. My mom saved all my childhood toys for my daughter. But I thought that was weird and kinda silly because I felt she deserved her own new toys. Also... what if your son never has kids? You shouldn't expect that to be a thing when it isn't up to you.", "NTA\n\nYour son has these toys because your in-laws stepped up when your ex abandoned him. They made sure he didn\u2019t go without from his paternal side. He doesn\u2019t get to demand toys from you simply because he wants them. He didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to ask nicely. He can afford toys for his kids. He had more than six years of not spending on your son to save for them. Plus he can afford toys for his children. My guess he wants these toys because his parents bought them. His children don\u2019t have a connection with their grandparents because they disowned the ex. He\u2019s trying to use these toys to falsify a connection. Giving the toys to his kids mean they have something from them and something from their big brother. His situation with his parents is unfortunate, but he made a choice to lie to you and then abandon his responsibilities. You don\u2019t owe him any favors.", "NTA It was your son's decision, and he put the ball in your court.", "YTA you can keep some for the future but since your son is fine with it, it would be a nice gesture to give his siblings his toys.", "The ex seems like a total asshole. And an entitled one at that. Notice in the post that he called OP and informed her he would be picking up the toys? He didn't even have the decency to ask or be polite about it. Then he called her a jerk for not  giving into his demands? That's verbal abuse. It seems like he thinks the world revolves around him. He's probably just bitter that his parents cut him off financially when he abandoned his first family.", "This is also something to clarify to your husband. He has no right to demand things that he didn't even pay for. As well as it just being completely out of line in the first place to demand things from your house", "I completely agree with you. I suggest letting her son pick a toy for each sibling that they can play with in a few years and giving it as a Christmas present or birthday present then. \n\n Im 25 years old and have a couple stuffed animals from when I was born. They are just sitting in my closet now but they hold sentimental value to me. My mamaw bought them the day I was born and my mamaw pretty much raised me, so they mean a lot to me because my mamaw passed on. I have 2 kids and they are about the same age as the little kids here as I won't let them play with my stuffies, right now. When they are older and not as rough I will let them play with or sleep with them as long as they are careful.", "This is spot on except if ex\u2019s parents disowned him because he\u2019s gay. We weren\u2019t told that but it seems not unlikely.", "Agree.   I wish I would have kept more of my children\u2019s toys.", "Indeed, it just feels like the larger issue is the fact that the ex was window shopping over things that are in the poster's possession, and is verbally abusive toward the poster", "This.", "Plenty of parents hold onto toys for their future grandchildren. No need to make OP feel bad about that. The ex is the one obsessing over toys that he has zero rights to.", "Then he should go ask his parents for the toys since they bought them. Oh, right, he doesn't have a relationship with them. He certainly doesn't have any rights to demand toys his parents bought for his child that he abandoned for 6 years.", "No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. She can do whatever she wants, those toys are her property. She had already said she would like to have them for when she has grandkids, and that\u2019s legit. Ex just wants to be able to say that he finally had a kid that gets to play at HIS house with the toys his parents bought\u2026 for his first kid, the one he abandoned for 6 years.", "What? How does that make sense? Since when are childrens toys part of divorce settlements?!", "According to the post Ex\u2019s parents bought them, mostly after the divorce.", "Everything is in the post. OP's ex's parents paid for the toys She asked her son and he didn't care. She is keeping it for the future grandkids.", ">If you paid for the toys and/or took care of them for your child,\n\nI didn't pay for them, it was my former in laws who did, and I'm taking care of them for my son now.", "Exactly. He's been window browsing at the poster's house, and it would seem thinks they are able to intimidate the poster enough to just make that demand and then verbally abuse the poster.\n\nThis is something that the posters new husband really needs to wrap his head around. The ex is not entitled to speak to the poster like this at all. And if he doesn't have a problem with this speech style, he needs to take some of that dermatologist money and go to therapy", "I thought about that. But then I reread the part of OP's post where she said that he called her up and just **told her** he would be coming and picking up the toys. He didn't bother to even ask, which is so entitled. Even worse, he verbally attacked her when she said no. THEN, he tried to emotionally manipulate her by saying the toys would be a connection between all of the brothers. I mean, the ex probably has regrets that he missed out on 6 years of his eldest son's life. But he won't fix those regrets by demanding these toys.\n\nHe also seems to have no empathy for OP's experience, or the fact that he turned her world upside down when he left her to raise their son for 6 years without a father. If she wants to hold onto those toys because they remind her of her in-law's immense generosity during probably one of the toughest times of her life, then I can certainly understand that. If the ex can't understand that, then it speaks to how self-centered he is. And if he can't let this go, the real issue is that he's a bully with no boundaries.", "And she's making the big deal out of it that's going to taint the possession of them, anyway", "Fair enough. I guess I just auto assumed the parents disowned him for the gay thing and wrote that relationship off right away and forgot about them.", "And she\u2019d rather they collect dust in a basement then be played with. I agree she can do what she wants, but it\u2019s still petty as fuck.", "actually yes it can, because that\u2019s personal property, which can be detailed within divorce settlements", "i misread that part, thnx for that", "you could ask them if they want those toys back, if you can keep them, or to give it back to their son. BUT, if this was part of the divorce settlement then you should definitely keep them", "Only if she gives into the exe's guilt trip. If she holds her head high and ignores his tantrum, then they aren't tainted. It's all a state of mind. OP, don't let these negative comments get to you. You have done absolutely nothing wrong."]}
