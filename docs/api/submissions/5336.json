On one hand, why bother asking him if your just going to keep them. On the other hand your ex was quite brazen asking for such a thing. However, in some ways, he does have a point. Perfectly good toys are just going to be sitting there, gathering dust, waiting for grandchildren in which there is no *real* guarantee you will actually get. I\u2019m sorry to say that but, that\u2019s the reality of life. \n\nMy mother had much the same thoughts, save some of my baby toys and clothes for any potential grandchildren, but still donate some so at least some can still be used right away. She kept more of the sentimental items or items that I held sentimental. Perhaps, you both could go through it and pick out what you want to keep and what you are willing to part with?

He can afford toys for his kids. He had more than six years of not spending on your son to save for them. Plus he can afford toys for his children. My guess he wants these toys because his parents bought them. His children don\u2019t have a connection with their grandparents because they disowned the ex. He\u2019s trying to use these toys to falsify a connection. Giving the toys to his kids mean they have something from them and something from their big brother.

And an entitled one at that. Notice in the post that he called OP and informed her he would be picking up the toys? He didn't even have the decency to ask or be polite about it. Then he called her a jerk for not  giving into his demands? That's verbal abuse. It seems like he thinks the world revolves around him. He's probably just bitter that his parents cut him off financially when he abandoned his first family.", "This is also something to clarify to your husband. He has no right to demand things that he didn't even pay for. As well as it just being completely out of line in the first place to demand things from your house", "I completely agree with you. I suggest letting her son pick a toy for each sibling that they can play with in a few years and giving it as a Christmas present or birthday present then. \n\n Im 25 years old and have a couple stuffed animals from when I was born. They are just sitting in my closet now but they hold sentimental value to me. My mamaw bought them the day I was born and my mamaw pretty much raised me, so they mean a lot to me because my mamaw passed on.

He's been window browsing at the poster's house, and it would seem thinks they are able to intimidate the poster enough to just make that demand and then verbally abuse the poster.\n\nThis is something that the posters new husband really needs to wrap his head around. The ex is not entitled to speak to the poster like this at all. And if he doesn't have a problem with this speech style, he needs to take some of that dermatologist money and go to therapy", "I thought about that. But then I reread the part of OP's post where she said that he called her up and just **told her** he would be coming and picking up the toys. He didn't bother to even ask, which is so entitled. Even worse, he verbally attacked her when she said no. THEN, he tried to emotionally manipulate her by saying the toys would be a connection between all of the brothers. I mean, the ex probably has regrets that he missed out on 6 years of his eldest son's life. But he won't fix those regrets by demanding these toys.\n\nHe also seems to have no empathy for OP's experience, or the fact that he turned her world upside down when he left her to raise their son for 6 years without a father. If she wants to hold onto those toys because they remind her of her in-law's immense generosity during probably one of the toughest times of her life, then I can certainly understand that. If the ex can't understand that, then it speaks to how self-centered he is. And if he can't let this go, the real issue is that he's a bully with no boundaries.", "[deleted]", "Fair enough.

If you don\u2019t want to share the toys\u2026you don\u2019t have to.", "NTA but your ex is.", "NTA. \nHow does he know you have a room full of toys in good condition. and why do you have a room full of toys.\n\nWhere did he find the audacity to call up and ask for the toys idk.\n\nI HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS!!", "NTA", "NTA. He doesn't get to use your sons tots for the new kids that he plans to accrual spend time raising. Your sons belongings are something you keep and cherish, not his dead beat dad's consolation prize.", "You should offer to give him back ONLY the ones he purchased. Me thinks it won\u2019t be a lot.", "Your son may thank you later when he shows his kids what he played with.  20 yo should be thinking of other things. NTA and money doesn't matter, not up to in and out ex.", "NTA \n\nYour ex abandoned your son and gave up his rights as a parent so I\u2019m surprised he has 50% custody. He\u2019s not a good parent at all otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have abandoned your son. He\u2019s literally drama wrapped up in a pretty bow and not someone I would want my child around and take after in the sense that possibly cheating and abandoning responsibilities,such as a child, is okay. \n\nI say possibly cheating because how would your ex have found out he was gay if he didn\u2019t get with any guys during your marriage????", "Your ex' parents cut him off and bought those toys after, even if you wanted to lend them you would need THEIR permission as well. But it doesnt matter because you dont want to. So no. NTA\n\nHe didnt even ask if he could take them lmaooo, just told you he would ffs. Nta smdh", "NTA.\nEx husband walks away from his 5 year old son and doesn't come back into his life until he was 11. That must have been so unsettling for him. Ex is the AH for telling OP he is going to take the toys. How does he know what's there anyway? And then gets verbally abusive when told no.", "NTA, it\u2019s not his right to expect you to give him something that doesn\u2019t belong to him or his new kids", "NTA but I think there's more to think about here. His reaction seems very predictable, he sees it as toys HIS parents bought and that they are more rightfully his. This seems like something that an absentee (selfish?) parent would think, but also might be the cusp of him and his parents having a confrontation.\n\nBut to reiterate with your second part, his parents helped you out while you became a single income household. How you've described it makes it clear that his kids won't likely encounter through the same hardships that your son would've faced. So yeah, what an asshole!", "NTA, they're your son's toys, he told you you were free to do whatever with them, so you did. It's your choice and your ex has no power over that, even if your ex couldn't afford toys it wouldn't be required to give them to your ex's kids. Your ex is being entitled, his parents didn't buy the toys for him they bought them for your son.", "SIX YEARS?! Nope. That so beyond unacceptable and I would hold your ground purely on principle, because there\u2019s something so gross about your ex demanding these toys that came into his own child\u2019s life during the time when he was completely abandoning said child! If his parents disowned him for being gay, that\u2019s also utterly unacceptable, but he absolutely still had an obligation to show up as a father. \n\nSIX YEARS!!?!", "NTA", "INFO: what if your son doesn't have kids?\n\nLike I get the sentiment but your whole post keeps bringing up these \"future grandkids\" you might get, then they can play with toys that are 20+ years old?", "Have to agree here. Picking up after 6nyers is disgraceful. Sure better late than never but this is not an \"amazing father\". No matter what he does there is no making up for early childhood neglect.", "I didn't think there was much to think about here. Those toys belonged to her child and it's natural to keep them for any future grandchildren. Many parents save their children's toys for potential future grandchildren, they don't dish them out to the ex to be used for their kids. If the ex wants toys, he can go buy his own.", "The son is twenty, he's not thinking about the future. In another ten or so years time, if he does have children, he'll be grateful his mother kept those toys to pass on to them and share memories.", "What did she need to cooperate with her ex for? Her kid is 20 they don\u2019t need to coparent anymore. Her ex was telling her he was going to take her kid\u2019s stuff. This is not cooperation and it doesn\u2019t require cooperation.", "Calling her a jerk is \u201cverbal abuse\u201d? In what world lmao", "does OP say that's why they disowned him though? not because he was gay? I don't see it but might have missed something", "seriously!  i was thinking the same thing.   and yelling at someone isn't abusive either.  You poor poor flowers..", "Yes, it's an insult and abusive language in this context.", "They are saying he is delusional enough to think that\u2019s the reason when it was in their opinion his obvious abandonment of his child is probably the real reason.  I think personally it could be two reasons, the abandonment of his child and two not that he was gay but that he married OP and probably knew he was gay or had an inkling. I know people are going to say sometimes you don\u2019t know  but I am highly doubtful of that and from what I have read on here it doesn\u2019t sound like the ex husbandsor ex wives  are particularly sorry, its just oh well, now I will move on having taken up a majority of your life and your baby making talent. The men can still have kids but they may not want to start over later in life and have a younger child, who may not necessarily have them as long as their other children as well as they would have older brothers and sisters who could look out for them. I think everybody\u2019s missing the point that OP\u2019s ex wasn\u2019t being verbally abusive, he was being manipulative, he knew OP wouldn\u2019t want to give up those toys so he used manipulative language. OP is definitely NTA."]}
