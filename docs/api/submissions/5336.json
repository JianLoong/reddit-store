My son was so careful as a child so the toys are as good as new, they are all packed and saved in a room at my house waiting to my future grandkids to play with their dad\u2019s old toys.\n\nHere is the thing: my ex married this man, and had kids the twins just turned three and my ex called to say that he\u2019d pick some of my son\u2019s old toys to give them to his kids, I had to call my son to see if he was ok with this and he told me he didn\u2019t really care and I could do what I wanted with the toys, so I told my ex that I decided to keep them for our future grandchildren because they are the ones who have the right to possess what their dad once owned, he called me a jerk for not letting his kids have the toys since my son doesn\u2019t really care much about them and there are kids around who can play with them and this was also a way to connect with their big brother.\n\nI mean I think I\u2019d be TA if they couldn\u2019t afford it but c\u2019mon ex\u2019s husband is a dermatologist and ex is an engineer, they can afford toys.

Ex wasn't present in my son's life until my son turned 11 that's when he started buying my son all the toys, those toys from ages 11-16 were donated a couple of years ago. Ex still paid child support. \n3. Ex didn't sign away his parental rights, the first agreement after the divorce was that I would have my son and he'd visit, but he often skipped the visitations and my son barely saw him for six years. \n4. Ex didn't cheat\n5. The toys I have stored are for kids in ages from 3-10. ex knows about them because we have improved our relationship over the years and he had visited me a couple of times. \n6. My son sees his little brothers as FAMILY, former in-laws sadly don't and call them \"plastic/synthetic babies\" \n7. former in-laws and I don't have the relationship we used to, they expected me to alone for ever lol, they got mad when I engaged to my fianc\u00e9 (now husband) because \"I wasn't teaching my son a good example\"   \n", "created_utc": 1671678922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsajvq/aita_for_not_giving_my_sons_old_toys_to_my_ex_so/", "score": 1735, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On one hand, why bother asking him if your just going to keep them. On the other hand your ex was quite brazen asking for such a thing. However, in some ways, he does have a point. Perfectly good toys are just going to be sitting there, gathering dust, waiting for grandchildren in which there is no *real* guarantee you will actually get. I\u2019m sorry to say that but, that\u2019s the reality of life. \n\nMy mother had much the same thoughts, save some of my baby toys and clothes for any potential grandchildren, but still donate some so at least some can still be used right away. She kept more of the sentimental items or items that I held sentimental. Perhaps, you both could go through it and pick out what you want to keep and what you are willing to part with?

He can afford toys for his kids. He had more than six years of not spending on your son to save for them. Plus he can afford toys for his children. My guess he wants these toys because his parents bought them. His children don\u2019t have a connection with their grandparents because they disowned the ex. He\u2019s trying to use these toys to falsify a connection. Giving the toys to his kids mean they have something from them and something from their big brother.

And an entitled one at that. Notice in the post that he called OP and informed her he would be picking up the toys? He didn't even have the decency to ask or be polite about it. Then he called her a jerk for not  giving into his demands? That's verbal abuse. It seems like he thinks the world revolves around him. He's probably just bitter that his parents cut him off financially when he abandoned his first family.", "This is also something to clarify to your husband. He has no right to demand things that he didn't even pay for. As well as it just being completely out of line in the first place to demand things from your house", "I completely agree with you. I suggest letting her son pick a toy for each sibling that they can play with in a few years and giving it as a Christmas present or birthday present then. \n\n Im 25 years old and have a couple stuffed animals from when I was born. They are just sitting in my closet now but they hold sentimental value to me. My mamaw bought them the day I was born and my mamaw pretty much raised me, so they mean a lot to me because my mamaw passed on.

He's been window browsing at the poster's house, and it would seem thinks they are able to intimidate the poster enough to just make that demand and then verbally abuse the poster.\n\nThis is something that the posters new husband really needs to wrap his head around. The ex is not entitled to speak to the poster like this at all. And if he doesn't have a problem with this speech style, he needs to take some of that dermatologist money and go to therapy", "I thought about that. But then I reread the part of OP's post where she said that he called her up and just **told her** he would be coming and picking up the toys. He didn't bother to even ask, which is so entitled. Even worse, he verbally attacked her when she said no. THEN, he tried to emotionally manipulate her by saying the toys would be a connection between all of the brothers. I mean, the ex probably has regrets that he missed out on 6 years of his eldest son's life. But he won't fix those regrets by demanding these toys.\n\nHe also seems to have no empathy for OP's experience, or the fact that he turned her world upside down when he left her to raise their son for 6 years without a father. If she wants to hold onto those toys because they remind her of her in-law's immense generosity during probably one of the toughest times of her life, then I can certainly understand that. If the ex can't understand that, then it speaks to how self-centered he is. And if he can't let this go, the real issue is that he's a bully with no boundaries.", "[deleted]", "Fair enough.

Having your sons toys that he played with as a child is not necessarily going to bring your son and his siblings closer together like dear old dad thinks!!", "YTA. You're choosing to leave toys unused for decades instead of giving them away to kids who can use them. The world is full of garbage plastic because of behavior exactly like this. You're thinking of hypothetical future children instead of the ones who could enjoy the toys immediately.", "These are toys purchased by the Ex's parents that cut him off, this is his fu to them. Now, it sounds like he may have done the right steps in divorcing when he realized and resetting his life, and if his parents cut him off for being gay they are definitely the AH's, buuuuuuut him abandoning his son for 6 years until he settled down with a new partner makes him an AH as well and OP should have no hand in getting involved in something that could get her son kicked from his current support, although if the son's grandparents are bigots I don't think taking their money is OK.... Because you know the EX isn't going to keep his mouth shut if he gets his hands on the toys purchased by his parents.\n\nNTA", "I think the background *is* relevant because the toys were purchased by the Ex's parents who cut him off after the divorce and we don't know if they cut him off due to abandoning his son or if they cut him off because he came out as gay or if they're still NC. The very same parents who are financially supporting OP's son right now. This could be a new cannon over the bow of a fresh battle between Ex and his parents and would firmly drag OP into the fight. And *if* the parents *are* homophobic I certainly don't support them, but that doesn't mean OP should be dragged into it when Ex has already done enough to her. \n\nBut it's also quite possible the parents went NC because the Ex went incommunicado from a 5 year old and don't care to reestablish bonds after it took him **6 years to reconnect** with his own son. So yeah, if Ex's parents want nothing to do with Ex's new family after the way he ghosted his first born then I would feel they have a right to do so as long as it wasn't based on bigotry. We just don't have the info on that but OP is NTA for staying out of it and preserving the toys for her own grandchildren.", "What are you talking about? The kid is not a kid anymore.", "So you think she as a single mother would refuse help from the child grandparents when the dad himself left in support of the dad ? Yeah lost me there", "To be fair, maybe the dad asked the son about the toys and son said he didn't care? Either way, dad is still an a-hole due to his reaction (and past actions).", "Letting toys sit unused for decades out of spite is 100% TA. We MUST reuse things.", "Or you know maybe it was because he push his son to the side to go live his brand new life...", "Idk why all y'all promote so much waste. Toys should be given away so they can be used. Otherwise they are very literally garbage.", "Having the right to do something doesn't make it the right thing to do.", "My dad also said that he wanted no children when he was younger, he has 3 kids now, people change. Of course that might be the case but there's nothing wrong in keeping the toys even if he doesn't want to be a father. That's a nice memory to have.", "No he doesn't, the toys were gifted by the people that disowned him, his own parents...  This would literally mean op was helping him out behind the grandparents back.", "/u/Right_Guarante is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.  Please downvote their comment and click the `report` button, selecting `Spam` then `Harmful bots`.  \n\nWith enough reports, the reddit algorithm will suspend this scammer.", "Good on you? Not everybody is like that, many of us say stuff like that and don't stuck to it, we grow and think again. There's nothing wrong in not wanting children but you can change your mind at some point, that's a possibility too", "Why do I find \u201cbaby making talent\u201d so funny but also like weirdly respectful? Cause yeah, so much goes into it for the uterus-bearing person and I\u2019m like \u201cgood for you for appreciating that!\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, no one is entitled to the toys. Your poor son being forgotten, not nice at all", "Keep the toys!!  Your ex has no right to them just because he had more children.  Saving them for your grandchildren is a normal thing to do.  You are not being selfish", "Tell him you'll send him the toys after he sends you back childsupport for 13 years.  \n\n\nHe has a decent job so, $1000/month for 156 months works out to about $156,000.", "I would ask your son how he feels. They're his toys. Nah", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he mentions they would be a connection to their \"older brother\" sets off blaring alarms for me.\n\nDoes your son have any relationship with his second attempt at fatherhood? Because if not, it's a huge no from me.", "YTA. Be nice", "This. OP, I would text your ex and tell him that he is never to bring up the toys or speak to you that way again, or you'll be blocking him.", "The kid is 20y, they divorced when the boy was 5 and dad was missing for 6. So, by my calculations, dad returned when son was 11 and has been part of via life for the last 9y. Dad was AH after divorce ? Yes, he was. Has he been making up for that for the last decade ? Seems so.\nWe only know ONE side of the story, the OP version. We don't know if dad talked with son about the toys for example, but we know, because OP said so, that son doesn't care about the toys and there are no grandkids and maybe never Will, who knows ?\nIn my opinion, dad is an AH because he can buy toys whenever and OP is an AH since she's doung it out of spite. Forget the divorce, it was 15 years ago, go on with your life.", "I paid for a lot of things for friends\u2019s kids, nieces and nephews, etc. but once I hand them over they aren\u2019t mine anymore. I certainly don\u2019t have any rights to decide what gets done with them after I hand them over.", "The ex never did say that he was disowned for being gay but it's just my guess that he's delusional enough to think that's why they disowned him and not for the reason that he abandoned his own son. But yeah, you're spot on. There is no way the ex is going to keep his mouth shut. I get the feeling he thinks people owe him. For what, I don't know. But well said.", "Wow! Very well said! To the point and this would establish the fact OP shouldn't be talked to like that. She's been through enough. Doesn't need to have some ex verbally abuse her.", "Very true. Might be out of spite, but I don't think so, but don't quote me on that of course. lol. With that being said, the son said he didn't care. I don't think it's so much that she's doing it out of spite, I think it's how he treated their son and more so, how demanding and verbally abusive he is being towards her and how it seems like he's owed something. We're of course, only getting one side of the story", "Google \"memories\"", "They are going to be given away. To her grandchildren. Note that I also listed several sources of toys that would be gently used, aka *were* given away to be used, that would also benefit charity or families in need of a little spare cash.", "We only know what OP choose to say, it's a very one sided version.", "No no. Sorry. I should have said in my opinion. Well actually, someone already clarified this for me. LOL.", "I love the irony of people calling me overly sensitive and a \u201cflower\u201d, because they can\u2019t handle my opinion. The projection is hilarious.", "Google \"plastic waste in America\".", "Hypothetical grandchildren that don't exist and may never exist, and would EASILY be able to get the toys back from the father. It is pure spite. This is why we can't have nice things. People refuse to share because of greed and emotions.", "Sorry, some of us prioritize ourselves and aren't miserable. Have a good day though.", "Their father wouldn't have the toys, their grandfathers would, and may or may not decide they want them for their own grandchildren. You can think it to be spite if you wish but that sounds like a you problem, particularly as you appear to equate emotions in general with spite and greed. Our family has followed this practice for generations - putting the toys away pending grandchildren (that's still re-using, you just don't like it personally) and if no grandchildren arrive then gifting it to niblings, to friends with children, to local charities, whatever their wishes are for their property. In this way we have toys that are new and toys that our grandparents played with when they were our age, some even handmade by previous generations of parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles. They are the special ones, the ones that have more stories attached to them as they're passed down. Worn by time, but still useable, used, and loved.", "Who's miserable? And what does keeping toys unused in a room have to do with \"prioritizing ourselves\"? It's just spite. Let kids play. OP is just hateful and spiteful. Her son should have said \"give the toys to the kids, because nobody is using them here\".", "Those toys serve as memories of her son's childhood for a mother who may miss having her son around. It's OK to prioritize keeping those toys and memories over protecting the environment from plastic waste. Having to do that would make many people miserable.", "Lolololol this is epic indoctrination. You are made HAPPY by a room full of unused toys? That delivers joy? Why? Take a fucking picture. Let objects be used for their intended purpose. If you aren't using something, you should give it away. That's it. Simple rule. If OP thinks people must be miserable in order to give away things they no longer use, that's a matter for mental health professionals, because it is wildly unreasonable and harmful to react and behave that way.", "Yes, you're miserable. I get it, no one loved you probably, and you probably never loved anyone. Stop talking maybe and soak up some sunlight. Take a walk in the park, listen to some prog rock. Smoke weed, be happy. Cheers.\n\nEta: this person below me is a cheerful soul who blocked me because they didn't have the balls to argue logically. Lol.", "NTA\n\nI understand him wanting the toys because his parents bought them. And since his parents disowned him, most likely because he\u2019s gay, is probably why he\u2019s seeking out those toys. It might be a way of him getting \u201crevenge\u201c on his parents.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with his parents most likely disowning him because of his sexuality. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that you were his wife and then he divorced you because he didn\u2019t know or couldn\u2019t admit he was gay and it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it sounds like the divorce was very messy. It also doesn\u2019t change the fact that he abandoned his child for six years. That\u2019s completely unacceptable behavior for any parent \n\nIf you earmarked the toys for future grandkids, they have been earmarked. The way it sounds like he treats you and speaks to you. Also not appropriate. When you say no, no means no. While being gay is a minority class, and bing gay often means individuals will receive persecution, it doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have privilege. He is male and he is experiencing male privilege as a gay man working in a high earning job. He can use his privilege to get his kids toys that are equivalent to the ones his parents are not buying for his children. Just because he is of a minority class as most likely persecuted, it does not mean he is entitled to your possessions. And the way he\u2019s acting can only be described as male behavior. That is unacceptable, I should say he\u2019s behaving like a toxic male because he\u2019s thinking he can see more women\u2019s opinion, and get his way simply by pushing past her, which is not appropriate.", "You seem like you're still mad about the divorce. YTA", "NTA (and you wont be)\n\nthose toys arent even yours to give away to beging with, they are your 20y old son's ... it would be up to HIM if he wants to gift them to his adopted siblings  \n\n\nbut son also said he doesnt care AT PRESENT (this probably could end up changing, cause when you hit a certain stage in your life there is a sudden desire to have some of your childhood back and when you loose access to thinks like your toys or other nostalgic items then its saddening)   \n\n\ngood on your to keep them for him, for that time when he hits that stage or when he ends up with kids.  (the son)", "Petty? Sure, but in a good way...AH? Nope, NTA", "NTA", "Yta and petty", "Exactly and then get really mad about it. He feels entitled. She not responsible for his kids. He's the one that abandoned two people, namely one being a small child. She can take care of herself and in reality doesn't need him. That kid needed his father and he left. Fine he came out, but what does that have to do with not wanting to do anything with your own child? Yeah, I wouldn't allow anyone into my home if they made demands like that. Good luck with that. lol Well said, basilobs.", "And my original comment said if they had no sentimental value, and it was out of spite.", "Okay great. That still leaves decades of unused items.

We are a one-family ticket to Armageddon.", "NTA - however, really, you don't have to store a childhood's worth of toys just in case.\n\nI would revisit your stash of toys and see which ones you really think are worthwhile in another decade or two and cull the rest. I would think one or two boxes should be kept.\n\nThey don't have to go to the ex, but around me, there are women's shelters that are always looking for nice used toys for family's escaping abusive situations.", "You are NTA but your ex seems entitled and your ex in laws are absolutely assholes", "Nta. You are not obligated to pass your shared son\u2019s toys down to your ex\u2019s new family under any circumstances.

You said the toys he bought when his son was older and he was a presence i.

So now he hopes to establish kid continuity through the earlier toys?  Does he blame you for getting rid of the toys he purchased during the   years he had reconnected?\n\nYour son isn\u2019t interested in those things now.
