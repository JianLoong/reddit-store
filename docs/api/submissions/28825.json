Before this incident I got along great with his family. I was invited to spend holidays with them and we exchanged gifts on birthdays so I thought we were pretty close. Every year Nick\u2019s family goes on a trip, this summer the trip was to somewhere i really wanted to go. I asked his mom,  who was planning the trip, if I could tag along if I payed for myself. She said sorry no but this is a family trip and I wasn\u2019t family yet. I told Nick and he said no one\u2019s s/o was invited so I wasn\u2019t the only one being excluded. I was still upset but dropped the subject. \n\nIt\u2019s now fall and the weather is getting cooler. Nick\u2019s family was coming over so I decided to make my family\u2019s chili recipe to celebrate the cold weather. Nick and his family love my chili so I made sure there was enough for them to take home. Before Nick\u2019s mom left she asked if I could share the recipe with her so she could make it for a work potluck. I told her sorry but this is a secret family recipe. She asked aren\u2019t we already considered family. I replied according to you we aren\u2019t. After that she when \u201coh ok\u201d then left. \n\nAfter everyone was gone Nick told me I was being cruel. I reminded him that his mother was the one who said I wasn\u2019t family first and she can\u2019t pick and choose when we are. He said that was a completely different situation and I was being petty. He left after that and has been cold to for the past couple of days.  I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m in the wrong here, it\u2019s ok for his mother to deny me something because we\u2019re not family but when I do it I\u2019m an asshole? \n\nAm I an asshole or was my response justified?", "created_utc": 1697209894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1770z8p/aita_for_not_sharing_a_family_recipe_with_someone/", "score": 3982, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family traveled somewhere you always wanted to go. You weren't allowed to join them, and he was fine with that because...that's just the way it was.\n\nBut his mom suffers a minor disappointment and he's willing to go to bat for her AND ice you out because...his mommy couldn't get your chili recipe?\n\nI hate how quick Reddit is to urge people to end relationships but in this case? \n\nGirl, kick him to the curb. It doesn't sound like your happiness will ever take priority over his mom's.\n\n**EDIT:** Plus his mom probably hates you now so seriously, have a talk with your boyfriend about his priorities and consider your options.\n\n**EDIT II:** And take that chili recipe to the grave!", "NTA. \"That was a completely different situation\". I agree with this. But not in your boyfriend's favor. A trip is just a one time trip, if things don't work out between you and your boyfriend, they don't have to keep you invited for their future trips. A family recipe is a family recipe. Once you give it to them, they have it forever regardless. This absolutely requires more of a family status than a vacation.", "NTA. I am here for aaaaalllll the petty! She brought it on herself. \n\nI couldn't imagine being together 4 years and finding out they don't see you as family, my husband's mom welcomed me into theirs the first time I ever met her - 3 months into dating!

And if your partner isnt on your team, then he never will. \n\nYa'll have been in a serious monogamous relationship for 4 years. It sounds like you all know eachother decently well too. If that not enough to establish mutual respect, then mommy doesnt get what she doesnt deserve. \n\nGenuine question; that trip they took.

I\u2019m choosing to give you the benefit of the doubt that it was said with just sass and not rudeness, but you really ought to reflect on your own to see if that\u2019s the truth for you. Maybe check in with your bf; I wonder if your tone and body language was harsh and that\u2019s what upset her. (That might be \u201cwhat\u2019s different\u201d to your bf).

Those can certainly be limited to family.\n\nThe mother was not very tactful in stating why this trip was limited to nuclear or legal family.

And would you be possessive of a family chili recipe if this trip did not exist? I'm betting on no. You said what you said because you're salty about not getting to go to the cool place.

It\u2019s kind of dumb rule to not invite partners until marriage (what if someone decided they never wanted to get married? Would the partner still be excluded even after they had been together 10+ years?) but you weren\u2019t the only one excluded, so it\u2019s not like it was personal towards you.  You could be making things unnecessarily contentious especially if you are planning on being with Nick for a long time.  You don\u2019t have to share the recipe, but you could have also been the bigger person and not thrown it back in her face and just said you don\u2019t share the recipe.

Before this incident I got along great with his family. I was invited to spend holidays with them and we exchanged gifts on birthdays so I thought we were pretty close. Every year Nick\u2019s family goes on a trip, this summer the trip was to somewhere i really wanted to go. I asked his mom,  who was planning the trip, if I could tag along if I payed for myself. She said sorry no but this is a family trip and I wasn\u2019t family yet. I told Nick and he said no one\u2019s s/o was invited so I wasn\u2019t the only one being excluded. I was still upset but dropped the subject. \n\nIt\u2019s now fall and the weather is getting cooler. Nick\u2019s family was coming over so I decided to make my family\u2019s chili recipe to celebrate the cold weather. Nick and his family love my chili so I made sure there was enough for them to take home. Before Nick\u2019s mom left she asked if I could share the recipe with her so she could make it for a work potluck. I told her sorry but this is a secret family recipe. She asked aren\u2019t we already considered family. I replied according to you we aren\u2019t. After that she when \u201coh ok\u201d then left. \n\nAfter everyone was gone Nick told me I was being cruel. I reminded him that his mother was the one who said I wasn\u2019t family first and she can\u2019t pick and choose when we are. He said that was a completely different situation and I was being petty. He left after that and has been cold to for the past couple of days.  I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m in the wrong here, it\u2019s ok for his mother to deny me something because we\u2019re not family but when I do it I\u2019m an asshole? \n\nAm I an asshole or was my response justified?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I asked all my siblings no one had seen it and started looking for it too.  At the dinner after the graveside I mentioned the book.  Everyone knew about the book but not where it was.  Mom piped up and said she didn\u2019t see it the other day when she was at the house.  What do you mean when you are at the house?  They had a bad divorce so she shouldn\u2019t have been in the house at all.  So her saying she didn\u2019t see it piqued my senses.  It let me know she had looked for the book.  Needless to say it never showed up.  My mother and I are NC for a few years.  I finally go LC after the kids are old enough.  I\u2019m at her home with my kids and what do I see on her bookshelf but my dads\u2019s family cookbook.  She sees that I noticed it and tells me she bought one similar at a yard sale.  I walkover and look at it.  It\u2019s my dad\u2019s book it has all the family recipes in their original handwritten form from my aunts, and grandparents.  She stands by the yard sale story.  I mention it to my siblings and one of them said that they knew it was the book and to just let it be.  My sister said this because she would be the one receiving the book when mom passes.  She\u2019s getting all my mom\u2019s possessions, I was livid.  I could care less about my mom\u2019s stuff I wanted my DAD\u2019s book.

I was told the book was in the trailer since it was the last things that were moved.  Everything else was in PODS on the property and they were untouched.  I don\u2019t believe her about the book, I saw the pictures of the fire so that\u2019s true.  Over the years she had asked me about a particular recipe she knew I had and should\u2019ve been in the book, it wasn\u2019t.  I had it committed to memory and it was never written down.  I used to make these cookies with my grandmother.  Mom wanted the recipe I wouldn\u2019t give it to her so that was the reason she took the book.

I know this will get lost, but I'm going to share it anyways.\n\nIt's not just about the recipe, which we all know.\n\nHere's my take, from my experience. I had made a dish (a casserole) that my husband really enjoyed. He was talking to his mother the next day and mentioned it after she asked what we were having for dinner (leftovers, because 2 people aren't typically finishing a casserole in one sitting). She said it sounded good and asked for the recipe. I had just found it, not a secret family recipe or anything, so sent the link over, not thinking anything of it.\n\nWhat happens the next week? She stops by my husband's work with the exact same casserole. And then she called later that evening to ask if it was good. She said she made a few tweaks and wondered which was better.\n\nShe created a competition between herself and I. She did this a few other times. There was a time I made banana bread frequently because I had access to overripe bananas at work for free, so why not. I'd experiment with different variations (chocolate chips, PB, cranberries, etc). Suddenly she's always dropping off banana bread.\n\nIf you get accused of petty again, just respond that you're just trying to respect the boundaries that exist within his family, when it comes to his family.
