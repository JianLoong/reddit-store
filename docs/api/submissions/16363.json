{"id": 16363, "submission_id": "137j8el", "title": "AITA for eating salad in front of my girlfriend and then making a joke about it?", "selftext": "I (28M) grew up in a family that put a lot of emphasis on healthy eating. As a kid, we always started dinner with a salad, and I've continued that practice as an adult. I don't take my salad with any dressing, and the only toppings I add are mushrooms and tomatoes. Since I don't put dressing on my salad, I often eat it with my hands since it's easier than trying to spear the dry mixed greens with a fork. I've been eating my salads like this basically since I was a teenager, and it was never an issue, even when having dinner with my parents. \n\nMy girlfriend (27F) eats salads occasionally, but doesn't love them the way I do, which is fine. She's currently pregnant, and pretty much all she wants to eat right now is meat and potato type meals, which is also fine. She's had some severe morning sickness in the first trimester and it's been a struggle to find foods that she can consistently keep down. So we'll make something she wants for dinner, and then I will pair it with a side salad for myself so I'm still getting my greens. \n\nLately, I've noticed she's been a little distant during dinner, so I asked her about it. She said that my side salads are \"unappetizing\" to her, and she requested I stop eating them in front of her because it makes her nauseous to watch. I told her that everything makes her nauseous right now, and that it's not fair to me that I have to change my lifelong diet because of her pregnancy symptoms. She told me that the issue isn't with the salad, it's the way I \"shove it down my throat like a caveman.\" Apparently that makes her gag and then she doesn't want to finish her own food. I told her that I've been eating my side salads like that for over a decade an no one has ever commented on it, so I think she's being overdramatic. I told her that her caveman comment was rude and unnecessary, and that I would continue the conversation with her when she's ready to talk about it in a more reasonable way. \n\nShe immediately got up and went into the nursery and shut the door behind her. When I walked by later, I could hear her crying, but I didn't go in and say anything because I feel like she should be the one to apologize to me for the crass comments she made about how I eat. She ended up sleeping on the glider in the nursery while I slept in our bed alone. \n\nWe sat down for breakfast this morning in silence, so I attempted to diffuse the tension by asking if the way I was eating my toast was acceptable or it it was also making her nauseous. She immediately started crying again, calling me an asshole and accusing me of not caring about her feelings or how hard the pregnancy has been on her. All I was trying to do was make a joke. And I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time, so I don't understand why she's making such a big deal about it. \n\nSo AITA for eating my salads in front of her and then making a joke about it the next morning? I want us to sit down and resolve this when she gets home from work tonight, so I guess if I need to apologize, I will.", "created_utc": 1683203544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137j8el/aita_for_eating_salad_in_front_of_my_girlfriend/", "score": 3261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't control her nausea but you can control how/where you eat your vegetables. I'm guessing,  by your clueless and unsympathetic reaction to her request,  that you're constantly dismissing her pregnancy symptoms. Especially since you think pregnancy isn't that big of a deal (\"I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time\"). Looking forward to your next post about being confused as to why your girlfriend won't let you in the delivery room.

Easy solution for the salad, you can eat it before eating with your gf, and have few bites of a potatoes with her. Is it that hard to find a compromise? \n\nAnd you're 2 times an a-hole for your comment about how \"women are just fine with pregnancy\". All my pregnancies and birth went perfectly. Still I was nauseous with cravings during first semester, still I was more sensitive and less patient, still I had to deal with my body changing forever etc etc. \n\nYou're just at the beginning of it.

And continued to be an ass about it the next morning.\n\nShe did not ask you to stop eating salad. She asked you to eat in another room or use a fork like 95 % of the world\u2026but you wanted to fight with her.   I personally only know people from India sit on the floor and eat with their hands but I do not know if they even eat \u2018salads\u2019.  Possibly other  cultures do as well but you did not mention you were from such a culture.\n\nEither way it was such a simple ask of you but you wanted it your way and yeah shes right you dont care.

And not mature enough for a relationship, let alone parenthood.", "YTA - seriously dude pick your battles. Your gf is pregnant and hormonal and clearly is having a hard time with food. She expressed to you that she would like for you to not eat your salad in front of her, you pushed the issue, she made it clear it made her nauseous and you then vilinized her for her normal reactions while pregnant because you felt insulted.\n\nNot only that, you hear your pregnant wife crying alone and you don't go to her and hug her or nothing because of your pride? Because you think your right when your 100% wrong?!\n\nAnd then you let her sleep anywhere but in her own bed.\n\nSeriously she just got the best glimpse of what your going to be like as a parent and she should run. I feel terrible for her, you are not a good spouse to her at all! Your \"joke\" was not at all a joke and you did it to try and prove a point. It's stupid and you need to treat her better, it's not all about you anymore.\n\nI constantly tell people to be very careful who they have children with because of people like you. Grow up and start treating your wife with respect, all you had to do was grab a fork or eat your salad when she isn't there.", "[removed]", "YTA, eat your salad with utinsels, I'd be disgusted by your eating habits, too.  How much do you want to die on this hill instead of eating with a fork to help your pregnant partner?  I find it silly that you think it's hard to eat with utensils. If you don't have a disability, why haven't you learned to ear like an adult? Why is something that is learned by toddlers so difficult for you?", "YTA. It\u2019s not difficult to eat salad with a fork, and your \u201cjoke\u201d was actually passive aggressive. The reason people have \u201cnever commented\u201d on the way you eat your salad is probably pure politeness. You\u2019re also very unsympathetic with your girlfriend\u2019s pregnancy symptoms; pregnancy is *hard* and you\u2019re being very dismissive of that. \n\nUnless you live in a country where eating with your hands is socially acceptable, eat your damned salad with utensils like an adult or when you go out for a meal with your kid people aren\u2019t going to be able to tell which one of you is the child.", ">I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time, so I don't understand why she's making such a big deal about it. \n\nYiiiikes I was kinda with you up till here.\n\nIf the smell of the mushrooms or something in the salad was nauseating your wife, I think she'd have a fair complaint.\n\nAs to your table manners -- are they up for negotiation if that's really, honestly, the base of the problem? I also tend to just put down utensils and eat whole leaves with fingers (think a finger and thumb picking up a couple of leaves, though, not two hands picking up a bunch and shoving it into my maw like Godzilla eating helicopters). But if someone who's carrying a child for me honestly found it *that* distressing, I think I could either go to a different room or find a new eating method. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nBut. This seems a weird thing to be setting off pregnancy nausea, and I'm not convinced that's actually what's happening.\n\n**Possibility 1**: She's experiencing pregnancy-onset misophonia, doesn't quite understand what's going on, and is explaining it as \"nausea\" to make life easier, or because she experiences nausea when she's upset. (Not far-fetched; anything that can make you a tiny bit queasy normally will often be a lot worse during pregnancy, thanks to the pressure and the hormonal effects on the digestive system.)\n\n**Possibility 2**: (more likely) You've annoyed her with something entirely different, pregnancy hormones are making it difficult for her to regulate her emotions as she usually would, and she's gone off at you over something that's relatively minor instead of what's really bothering her. Might not even be you at fault for the original thing. \n\n>We sat down for breakfast this morning in silence, so I attempted to diffuse the tension by asking if the way I was eating my toast was acceptable or it it was also making her nauseous.\n\nDid you really, *really* mean that as a joke? Because to me it reads as a snarky attempt to restart last night's argument and make yourself out to be a long-suffering martyr, and oooof. This is not the way to work through a problem. Especially with someone who's literally dealing with physical symptoms you'd struggle to even imagine. \n\nHer hormones are going nuts. Her ligaments are stretching. Her body is suddenly violently ejecting food whenever she tries to eat. Her energy levels are probably fluctuating wildly. She's struggling to keep herself hydrated. Bits of her just don't work and move the way they did a couple of months ago. Pregnancy is WILD and half the men I know would lose their absolute shit if they had the bog standard grab bag of symptoms that pregnancy induces in the human body. Frequent vomiting can cause extra nasty issues, like esophageal scarring, acid reflux, sore throat, mouth ulcers...\n\nWomen don't go through pregnancy *just fine*, dude, they **cope** with it because they're bad-arse and socialised to tolerate pain and discomfort. That doesn't mean a pregnant woman doesn't deserve some consideration and care from the father of her freaking fetus.\n\nYTA for the dismissive and condescending attitude. Talk to your girlfriend like you're both human beings who love and care for each other, FFS, and figure out what's going on. She might be habitually abusive and manipulative, but judging from your surprise at her reaction, I'm guessing not? You don't have to bow to her every whim just because she's pregnant, but you can show that you care about her. \n\nLike: you knew that she was crying and walked away because in your opinion, she owed you an apology. **SO WHAT??** If someone's in emotional distress, you don't have to apologise to give them a hug and a box of tissues and make sure they're OK. You can tend to someone's emotional needs *and* disagree with them -- it's not like the first to make physical contact loses the argument. Just - pick it up later when you're both calmer instead of reacting emotionally.", "YTA, she is PREGNANT. Eat your salad with your hands after dinner without her there.

You've been in an echo chamber of a family with bad table manners and this might be your first taste of the real world, which, for salad, generally involves cutlery.

Which, to each their own, but if it's bothering your pregnant SO, it's just a completely out of touch response to think how you eat is normal and there's no reason it should bother her. \n\n3) The way you minimize her pregnancy symptoms and actively let her be upset and cry because of some ridiculous and non-existent moral high ground you think you have. \n\n4) Seeing all of this, typing out what you typed out, and STILL thinking you're in the right. \n\nGrow up and apologize to your SO.

As a kid, we always started dinner with a salad, and I've continued that practice as an adult. I don't take my salad with any dressing, and the only toppings I add are mushrooms and tomatoes. Since I don't put dressing on my salad, I often eat it with my hands since it's easier than trying to spear the dry mixed greens with a fork. I've been eating my salads like this basically since I was a teenager, and it was never an issue, even when having dinner with my parents. \n\nMy girlfriend (27F) eats salads occasionally, but doesn't love them the way I do, which is fine. She's currently pregnant, and pretty much all she wants to eat right now is meat and potato type meals, which is also fine. She's had some severe morning sickness in the first trimester and it's been a struggle to find foods that she can consistently keep down. So we'll make something she wants for dinner, and then I will pair it with a side salad for myself so I'm still getting my greens. \n\nLately, I've noticed she's been a little distant during dinner, so I asked her about it. She said that my side salads are \"unappetizing\" to her, and she requested I stop eating them in front of her because it makes her nauseous to watch. I told her that everything makes her nauseous right now, and that it's not fair to me that I have to change my lifelong diet because of her pregnancy symptoms. She told me that the issue isn't with the salad, it's the way I \"shove it down my throat like a caveman.\" Apparently that makes her gag and then she doesn't want to finish her own food. I told her that I've been eating my side salads like that for over a decade an no one has ever commented on it, so I think she's being overdramatic. I told her that her caveman comment was rude and unnecessary, and that I would continue the conversation with her when she's ready to talk about it in a more reasonable way. \n\nShe immediately got up and went into the nursery and shut the door behind her. When I walked by later, I could hear her crying, but I didn't go in and say anything because I feel like she should be the one to apologize to me for the crass comments she made about how I eat. She ended up sleeping on the glider in the nursery while I slept in our bed alone. \n\nWe sat down for breakfast this morning in silence, so I attempted to diffuse the tension by asking if the way I was eating my toast was acceptable or it it was also making her nauseous. She immediately started crying again, calling me an asshole and accusing me of not caring about her feelings or how hard the pregnancy has been on her. All I was trying to do was make a joke. And I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time, so I don't understand why she's making such a big deal about it. \n\nSo AITA for eating my salads in front of her and then making a joke about it the next morning? I want us to sit down and resolve this when she gets home from work tonight, so I guess if I need to apologize, I will.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she is asking you to not eat her salad in front of her (read this carefully, shes not asking you to chance your diet) that's the least you can do. If she is crying in a room, go and comfort her.

You KNEW she was already in an emotional position about this since you heard her crying last night \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already been told this but women\u2019s hormones go WILD during pregnancy.

You\u2019re supposed to be her rock right now and making jokes out of something that feels very real and upsetting to her is only going to hurt your relationship, whether you think you\u2019re in the right or not.

That was a bit dramatic. She could have worded it better so you didn't immediately get defensive.

Why would you not want to be compassionate in this case and find out what her trigger foods are and consume then whenever she's not around you? I'm genuinely baffled why you don't care about your partner in this instance.\n\nHow important can this salad tradition of yours really be? I'm guessing it's a habit at this point, but is it really a habit that you can't break for a few months for the sake of your pregnant partner? Think about all the sacrifices she's had to make for this pregnancy so far, and of how many she is still to make for the sake of your family. Is there really no compromise in this situation (you eat salad with a fork, you eat salad when she's not around)? \n\nAlso, and this is just a general tip, please read up more about pregnancies and the toll they take on the person who's pregnant.

She literally didn't ask you to do anything until you questioned her about her behaviour and when she was honest and asked only for you to simply use a fork so she isn't needlessly uncomfortable, you made her feel like trash for it.

As long as you mean in when you say it was just meant to diffuse the tension and it truly wasn't a dig.\n\nAnd everybody who's so disgusted by eating salad with your hands... why are you so sensitive about this? Who actually cares? As long as your hands are clean eating a dry salad is literally no different than eating a hotdog or hamburger with your hands, and is much cleaner. There is not a single valid reason to have a problem with eating salad with your hands, but think it's totally normal with pizza. It's less common, but it isn't \"disgusting\" as so many of you claim. You need to relax. \n\nOP, apologize for the second joke. Unintentionally or not, you hurt her with that joke. Asking her to take a step back because YOU were hurt by her caveman comment was not wrong, but the second joke was. She's going through a really hard time, and she was rude, but you should really let it slide. Pregnancy really is hard, and not ever being rude at all for nine months would be pretty incredible, so I think you should leave it. And even though I don't think you should have to, you should eat them with a fork until the pregnancy is over. It's fine normally, but if it's making her nauseous you should be happy to compromise. \n\nAlso, im not saying she's being knowingly racist, but plenty of cultures around the world still eat with their hands. It's not caveman behavior, like it died out. It's just not as common in the US.", "NTA. She doesn't have to watch. People are far too sensitive if they have to comment on your food habits, especially if they're healthy habits", "NTA women think just because they're pregnant they get to do and say whatever they want.

She shouldn't watch you eat salad if she doesn't like it.\n\nI'd say this is some SERIOUS red flag behaviour, but honestly? When pregnant, women's hormones can go crazy and they can be completely illogical. It'll pass. Women's bodies just don't go through this the same way, there can be a lot of different reactions.\n\nYou did make the mistake of posting this on AITA, where people are so eager to justify the shitty behaviour of pregnant people, it boggles the mind. Seriously, you could write a post saying \"My pregnant girlfriend skinned my dog alive because I forgot her snack at the store\", and the comments will cry \"She's literally making another human! Can't she have her snack!?\"\n\nDon't hold this against her, but definitely don't balk. If you let yourself be controlled, you'll be controlled more and more, until you're absolutely miserable.
