{"id": 16363, "submission_id": "137j8el", "title": "AITA for eating salad in front of my girlfriend and then making a joke about it?", "selftext": "I (28M) grew up in a family that put a lot of emphasis on healthy eating. As a kid, we always started dinner with a salad, and I've continued that practice as an adult. I don't take my salad with any dressing, and the only toppings I add are mushrooms and tomatoes. Since I don't put dressing on my salad, I often eat it with my hands since it's easier than trying to spear the dry mixed greens with a fork. I've been eating my salads like this basically since I was a teenager, and it was never an issue, even when having dinner with my parents. \n\nMy girlfriend (27F) eats salads occasionally, but doesn't love them the way I do, which is fine. She's currently pregnant, and pretty much all she wants to eat right now is meat and potato type meals, which is also fine. She's had some severe morning sickness in the first trimester and it's been a struggle to find foods that she can consistently keep down. So we'll make something she wants for dinner, and then I will pair it with a side salad for myself so I'm still getting my greens. \n\nLately, I've noticed she's been a little distant during dinner, so I asked her about it. She said that my side salads are \"unappetizing\" to her, and she requested I stop eating them in front of her because it makes her nauseous to watch. I told her that everything makes her nauseous right now, and that it's not fair to me that I have to change my lifelong diet because of her pregnancy symptoms. She told me that the issue isn't with the salad, it's the way I \"shove it down my throat like a caveman.\" Apparently that makes her gag and then she doesn't want to finish her own food. I told her that I've been eating my side salads like that for over a decade an no one has ever commented on it, so I think she's being overdramatic. I told her that her caveman comment was rude and unnecessary, and that I would continue the conversation with her when she's ready to talk about it in a more reasonable way. \n\nShe immediately got up and went into the nursery and shut the door behind her. When I walked by later, I could hear her crying, but I didn't go in and say anything because I feel like she should be the one to apologize to me for the crass comments she made about how I eat. She ended up sleeping on the glider in the nursery while I slept in our bed alone. \n\nWe sat down for breakfast this morning in silence, so I attempted to diffuse the tension by asking if the way I was eating my toast was acceptable or it it was also making her nauseous. She immediately started crying again, calling me an asshole and accusing me of not caring about her feelings or how hard the pregnancy has been on her. All I was trying to do was make a joke. And I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time, so I don't understand why she's making such a big deal about it. \n\nSo AITA for eating my salads in front of her and then making a joke about it the next morning? I want us to sit down and resolve this when she gets home from work tonight, so I guess if I need to apologize, I will.", "created_utc": 1683203544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137j8el/aita_for_eating_salad_in_front_of_my_girlfriend/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't control her nausea but you can control how/where you eat your vegetables. I'm guessing,  by your clueless and unsympathetic reaction to her request,  that you're constantly dismissing her pregnancy symptoms. Especially since you think pregnancy isn't that big of a deal (\"I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time\"). Looking forward to your next post about being confused as to why your girlfriend won't let you in the delivery room.  YTA", "You literally had me viewing you as reasonable and normal until this comment.\n\n\"And I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time, so I don't understand why she's making such a big deal about it.\"\n\nThen you lost me. Now I see you as unreasonable, as well as an idiot, as well as an asshole. YTA.\n\nNo, women don't go through it 'just fine' all the time. It is often a very hard time and women get through it with support from their partner and loved ones. They struggle, all the time. Struggling is far more common than being 'just fine' for 9 months.\n\nI carried my baby, and my husband carried me. When him hocking loogies into the shower drain made me throw up, he stopped doing it. EVEN THOUGH nobody had ever complained about him doing it before in his whole life. Now, 9 or so years later, I don't even know where his loogies go. And I didn't have to cry alone all night and be dismissed or belittled or shut down for my feelings about it.\n\nDo your weird ass salad thing somewhere else. Have it for lunch. Use a fork. Such a simple, simple request that didn't have to blow up into making her that upset.", "Use a fork.", "Yta your gf, who is carrying your child, your child who is making her physically ill, has asked you to not eat salad in front of her for what,  7 months?\n\nYou have an EASY accommodation, eat it before or after dinner with her. Or eat one at lunch. Or use a fork like a human.\n\nAlso, your \"joke\" wasn't a joke. You were being passive aggressive about her not liking your shitty table manners.", "YTA for the joke you made. Easy solution for the salad, you can eat it before eating with your gf, and have few bites of a potatoes with her. Is it that hard to find a compromise? \n\nAnd you're 2 times an a-hole for your comment about how \"women are just fine with pregnancy\". All my pregnancies and birth went perfectly. Still I was nauseous with cravings during first semester, still I was more sensitive and less patient, still I had to deal with my body changing forever etc etc. \n\nYou're just at the beginning of it. Step up man.", "You couldn't eat the salad somewhere else before dinner? \ud83d\ude44\n\nIt doesn't cost a thing for you to be kind and accommodating to the woman carrying your child. \n\nYTA", "YTA she won't be pregnant forever but she will remember how you treated her during her pregnancy. You would only be slightly inconvenienced by eating your salad like a savage in another room where it wouldn't bother her. Or just use a fork!", "You eat your salad with your hands\u2026.\n\nI guess im some cultures would differ but just that alone id be embarassed for your gf if you did that in public", "YTA - watching someone eat *SALAD* with their hands sounds utterly disgusting.  That's just poor manners and I don't care how long you've been \"doing it\".  Someone should have said something to you about it long before now.", "YTA\n\nYour joke was passive aggressive. If you though it would diffuse the tension you seriously lack any self-awareness.\n\nAnd use a fork, you're an adult.", "YTA, you have no idea what pregnancy nausea is, you literally eat salad with your hands\u2026the toast comment was unnecessary and you know it.", "YTA bc you are unwilling to compromise. And continued to be an ass about it the next morning.\n\nShe did not ask you to stop eating salad. She asked you to eat in another room or use a fork like 95 % of the world\u2026but you wanted to fight with her.

And not mature enough for a relationship, let alone parenthood.", "YTA - seriously dude pick your battles. Your gf is pregnant and hormonal and clearly is having a hard time with food. She expressed to you that she would like for you to not eat your salad in front of her, you pushed the issue, she made it clear it made her nauseous and you then vilinized her for her normal reactions while pregnant because you felt insulted.\n\nNot only that, you hear your pregnant wife crying alone and you don't go to her and hug her or nothing because of your pride? Because you think your right when your 100% wrong?!\n\nAnd then you let her sleep anywhere but in her own bed.\n\nSeriously she just got the best glimpse of what your going to be like as a parent and she should run. I feel terrible for her, you are not a good spouse to her at all! Your \"joke\" was not at all a joke and you did it to try and prove a point. It's stupid and you need to treat her better, it's not all about you anymore.\n\nI constantly tell people to be very careful who they have children with because of people like you. Grow up and start treating your wife with respect, all you had to do was grab a fork or eat your salad when she isn't there.", "YTA. Women literally die during pregnancy and even though I had an \u201ceasy\u201d pregnancy with little to no nausea it was still exhausting and emotional and shitty. \n\nYou can fuck right off with your dismissive attitude.", "YTA, eat your salad with utinsels, I'd be disgusted by your eating habits, too.  How much do you want to die on this hill instead of eating with a fork to help your pregnant partner?  I find it silly that you think it's hard to eat with utensils. If you don't have a disability, why haven't you learned to ear like an adult? Why is something that is learned by toddlers so difficult for you?", "YTA. It\u2019s not difficult to eat salad with a fork, and your \u201cjoke\u201d was actually passive aggressive. The reason people have \u201cnever commented\u201d on the way you eat your salad is probably pure politeness. You\u2019re also very unsympathetic with your girlfriend\u2019s pregnancy symptoms; pregnancy is *hard* and you\u2019re being very dismissive of that. \n\nUnless you live in a country where eating with your hands is socially acceptable, eat your damned salad with utensils like an adult or when you go out for a meal with your kid people aren\u2019t going to be able to tell which one of you is the child.", ">I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time, so I don't understand why she's making such a big deal about it. \n\nYiiiikes I was kinda with you up till here.\n\nIf the smell of the mushrooms or something in the salad was nauseating your wife, I think she'd have a fair complaint.\n\nAs to your table manners -- are they up for negotiation if that's really, honestly, the base of the problem? I also tend to just put down utensils and eat whole leaves with fingers (think a finger and thumb picking up a couple of leaves, though, not two hands picking up a bunch and shoving it into my maw like Godzilla eating helicopters). But if someone who's carrying a child for me honestly found it *that* distressing, I think I could either go to a different room or find a new eating method. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nBut. This seems a weird thing to be setting off pregnancy nausea, and I'm not convinced that's actually what's happening.\n\n**Possibility 1**: She's experiencing pregnancy-onset misophonia, doesn't quite understand what's going on, and is explaining it as \"nausea\" to make life easier, or because she experiences nausea when she's upset. (Not far-fetched; anything that can make you a tiny bit queasy normally will often be a lot worse during pregnancy, thanks to the pressure and the hormonal effects on the digestive system.)\n\n**Possibility 2**: (more likely) You've annoyed her with something entirely different, pregnancy hormones are making it difficult for her to regulate her emotions as she usually would, and she's gone off at you over something that's relatively minor instead of what's really bothering her. Might not even be you at fault for the original thing. \n\n>We sat down for breakfast this morning in silence, so I attempted to diffuse the tension by asking if the way I was eating my toast was acceptable or it it was also making her nauseous.\n\nDid you really, *really* mean that as a joke? Because to me it reads as a snarky attempt to restart last night's argument and make yourself out to be a long-suffering martyr, and oooof. This is not the way to work through a problem. Especially with someone who's literally dealing with physical symptoms you'd struggle to even imagine. \n\nHer hormones are going nuts. Her ligaments are stretching. Her body is suddenly violently ejecting food whenever she tries to eat. Her energy levels are probably fluctuating wildly. She's struggling to keep herself hydrated. Bits of her just don't work and move the way they did a couple of months ago. Pregnancy is WILD and half the men I know would lose their absolute shit if they had the bog standard grab bag of symptoms that pregnancy induces in the human body. Frequent vomiting can cause extra nasty issues, like esophageal scarring, acid reflux, sore throat, mouth ulcers...\n\nWomen don't go through pregnancy *just fine*, dude, they **cope** with it because they're bad-arse and socialised to tolerate pain and discomfort. That doesn't mean a pregnant woman doesn't deserve some consideration and care from the father of her freaking fetus.\n\nYTA for the dismissive and condescending attitude. Talk to your girlfriend like you're both human beings who love and care for each other, FFS, and figure out what's going on. She might be habitually abusive and manipulative, but judging from your surprise at her reaction, I'm guessing not? You don't have to bow to her every whim just because she's pregnant, but you can show that you care about her. \n\nLike: you knew that she was crying and walked away because in your opinion, she owed you an apology. **SO WHAT??** If someone's in emotional distress, you don't have to apologise to give them a hug and a box of tissues and make sure they're OK. You can tend to someone's emotional needs *and* disagree with them -- it's not like the first to make physical contact loses the argument. Just - pick it up later when you're both calmer instead of reacting emotionally.", "YTA, she is PREGNANT. Eat your salad with your hands after dinner without her there. You come off very entitled in this post and not like a supportive or caring partner that gets how awful pregnancy can be. While she is making a literal human, you can eat your salad in a different room or woth a fork. My God.", "YTA. Do you two never go out to eat? You've been in an echo chamber of a family with bad table manners and this might be your first taste of the real world, which, for salad, generally involves cutlery.

Get a fork and some empathy.", "YTA\n\nI can 100% guarantee the way you eat has always grossed her out but now it down right makes her want to puke.

As a kid, we always started dinner with a salad, and I've continued that practice as an adult. I don't take my salad with any dressing, and the only toppings I add are mushrooms and tomatoes. Since I don't put dressing on my salad, I often eat it with my hands since it's easier than trying to spear the dry mixed greens with a fork. I've been eating my salads like this basically since I was a teenager, and it was never an issue, even when having dinner with my parents. \n\nMy girlfriend (27F) eats salads occasionally, but doesn't love them the way I do, which is fine. She's currently pregnant, and pretty much all she wants to eat right now is meat and potato type meals, which is also fine. She's had some severe morning sickness in the first trimester and it's been a struggle to find foods that she can consistently keep down. So we'll make something she wants for dinner, and then I will pair it with a side salad for myself so I'm still getting my greens. \n\nLately, I've noticed she's been a little distant during dinner, so I asked her about it. She said that my side salads are \"unappetizing\" to her, and she requested I stop eating them in front of her because it makes her nauseous to watch. I told her that everything makes her nauseous right now, and that it's not fair to me that I have to change my lifelong diet because of her pregnancy symptoms. She told me that the issue isn't with the salad, it's the way I \"shove it down my throat like a caveman.\" Apparently that makes her gag and then she doesn't want to finish her own food. I told her that I've been eating my side salads like that for over a decade an no one has ever commented on it, so I think she's being overdramatic. I told her that her caveman comment was rude and unnecessary, and that I would continue the conversation with her when she's ready to talk about it in a more reasonable way. \n\nShe immediately got up and went into the nursery and shut the door behind her. When I walked by later, I could hear her crying, but I didn't go in and say anything because I feel like she should be the one to apologize to me for the crass comments she made about how I eat. She ended up sleeping on the glider in the nursery while I slept in our bed alone. \n\nWe sat down for breakfast this morning in silence, so I attempted to diffuse the tension by asking if the way I was eating my toast was acceptable or it it was also making her nauseous. She immediately started crying again, calling me an asshole and accusing me of not caring about her feelings or how hard the pregnancy has been on her. All I was trying to do was make a joke. And I know pregnancy is hard, but women go through it just fine all the time, so I don't understand why she's making such a big deal about it. \n\nSo AITA for eating my salads in front of her and then making a joke about it the next morning? I want us to sit down and resolve this when she gets home from work tonight, so I guess if I need to apologize, I will.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
