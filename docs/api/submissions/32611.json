Now, it's also your parents choice whether to be there.  They might decide they aren't coming if their two sons can't come.  \n\nPerhaps they can find someone to look after the boys and remove them from the wedding if they get overwhelmed.  You should ask what is their plan if the boys can't handle it.", "NTA\n\nBut this may not get you what you want. Be aware that you can only control yourself and your reactions at your wedding. Other people are still gonna feel how they feel.", "NTA but to make it less problematic, make it entirely child free. If your parents don't like it, they can stay home. \n\nYour wedding, your rules, your guest list.", "NTA - make arrangements for someone to care for them.", "Honestly this one's hard for me, like yes, I'm with everyone in saying that it's your wedding. You should get what you want.  But at the same time, I don't think it's fair to single out your brothers just because they're autistic.  It's not like it's something they could control.  I mean the way I'm hearing this it sounds like \" I want everyone at my wedding but my brothers because they're autistic and they'll cause problems.\" Like it does seem really cruel, so I don't know, maybe rather than singling them out, maybe you can make your wedding a 18+ wedding or something like that, just so you're not singling out your siblings", "INFO - Have they made other arrangements for caring for your brothers on the day of the wedding? Are they expecting you to be child care on the day of your wedding?\n\nYour parents are going to have to find a different babysitter after you move out and are unavailable.", "Nta - maybe offer to help find and pay for child care for that day for them.", "NAH. I understand your worries, but they are your brothers and belong to the family as well. Are there any things you can do before so they can be there and not \"interrupt\" things? Show them the place before? Show them where they sit? \"Practise\" the ceremony?\nTalk to your parents that you can not take care of them. Make a plan B if they get overhelmed And: can your parents really enjoy your wedding in constant worries about your brothers at home with a person who isn't able to take correct care of them? You mentionend that your parents only trust you and nobody else with this task", "Definitely NTA, this is your wedding, the focus should be on you and your partner. You have said that is a childfree wedding, no exceptions.\n\nAlso, if your siblings struggle with being overwhelmed or over stimulated, is it really fair to put them in a situation which likely could lead to meltdowns. \n\nYou can do something with them on a smaller scale before or after the wedding if you choose to do so. \n\nDon\u2019t let your parents make you change your mind and do what you want to do. \n\nHelping your parents with child care is great, don\u2019t let them push this carer role on you and do only want you can manage and maintain what boundaries you need to have.", "NTA, also your parents need to stop using you for child care as well.", "NTA. Is it to late to make it just a totally childfree wedding?", " NTA,\nYou want the day to be about you and your partner. If your parents can\u2019t give you that one day I think you need to reevaluate how you want to manage that relationship going forward. How old are you BTW ? And how often are you sitting for your brothers?", "Nta", "NAH\n\nBut claiming \"oh, it's a child-free wedding, so what a shame, they can't come\" is absurd. You know you have brothers. You made your plans knowing you have brothers. So you are directly choosing whether or not your brothers should attend. Hiding behind \"it's child-free\" is absurd.\n\nIt's your wedding, and you are, as always, allowed to invite whoever you like. And I can certainly sympathize with your desire not to have your brothers disrupt your wedding, and with your expectation that if they attended then they would be disruptive.\n\nYou're also excluding your brothers. To me, getting married and not inviting a sibling is a pretty pointed snub. If this was more motivated by \"this wouldn't be a good environment for them\" and less by \"I don't want them spoiling my day\", then it would feel less exclusionary.\n\nBut you also say that your parents don't really trust other people to care for your brothers. So childcare for your brothers is a real issue. You know your parents aren't just going to hire some random babysitter, so your idea to have the wedding during school hours might be the only practical way of having your parents present without your brothers.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur parents might chose not to come - prepare for that..", "NTA\n\nI understand not wanting a disruptive force at your wedding, especially as you already feel obligated to attend to them. It's your party, invite who you want.", "NTA - but your parents aren\u2019t assholes either. Obviously you want to be able to enjoy your wedding and you should be able to, but if you feel like your brothers will hinder that it\u2019s fine to not want them there (lots of weddings or no kids and it\u2019s generally accepted). If you can find a middle ground (care taker at the wedding) would try to find the alternatives, but generally no you deserve to minimize stress at your wedding.", "Nta the wedding is child free. That's it.  No kids.  They're kids, so they don't come.\n\nAlso, it sounds like they would NOT have fun.  Why is looking like a 'normal' family more important to your parents than ensuring their kids aren't tortured for a day?", "NTA - it's your wedding and your rules.  Just don't be shocked if people don't turn up because of those rules.  Your wedding, whilst special to you, does not require mandatory attendance.", "nta its your day not theirs have someone on watch to turn your parents away if they violate your boundaries. stop being the defacto babysitter at all family events. its one thing to pitch in its another to miss out on enjoying al life events because your parents are being selfish. They should hire a skilled nanny to help out.", "NTA.\n\nFor one wedding we went too for family we had a respite person come with us, watch our kiddo and leave early with him. For another one, we had a respite worker pick him up at 9.\n\nIn general I'd say it's really bad if your parents don't have any access to any respite for your brothers as that is going to exhaust them, and they need the break, and your brothers need to learn to work with others as well.", "NTA but this is not very likely to have the result that you hoped. More likely than not your parents will just refuse to attend rather than focus on your wedding, especially if they don\u2019t trust anyone else but you to help.", "NAH\n\nI recommend having a completely child free wedding so it's not just your parents feeling singled out. They might also be feeling this way because they feel singled out. But they can hire a baby sitter. Sure it's a little tricky with autistic children but there are sitters out there who know how to sit autistic kids.\n\nAnother option is a child free ceremony but family friendly reception or vice-versa. This way a sitter will only have to watch the children for the least amount of time possible. But your parents will have to make those kiddos behave properly while they're there, stims and all! If you're gonna go this route though, your best bet is to have some kind of sensory toys or devices around. Not just for your autistic siblings but for all the kids too, even neurotyoical children can sit still and find enjoyment with them!\n(As an autistic adult, I swear- sensory toys are a blessing.)", "OP\u2019s comments state the wedding is childfree.", "I told my parents it was child free. We're not inviting nephews or nieces either.", "I am moved out. Own a house. They still rely on solely me for childcare.", "According the OP's comments this is a completely childfree wedding.", "That was the reasoning I gave my parents. A child free wedding. They played the \"you don't want your brother's there?\" card.", "I'm 25. There's a large age gap. I am currently babysitting every few weeks.", "How am I the asshole here?", "The OP doesn't mention any worry about the brothers acting up, but that they will be expected to be child care.", ">your parents aren\u2019t assholes either\n\nSo wrong. Them pushing it makes them total AHs", "Perfect then you're 100% NTA", "This is an easy NTA then.  Child-free weddings are absolutely a thing.", "As long as you are fine with your parents nt beingg there, everything is ok.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu state that you enabled and trained them for years only to trust you as a babysitter. What else would they do?", "You kind of have yourself to blame for that. The word No needs more use by you.\n\nIf you are worried about your brothers behavior ruining the ceremony, that's valid.\n\nIf you are worried about being dragooned into child care .... your brothers deserve to be at as much of the ceremony that they can behave for. And your parents need to be made 100 clear that you will not be child care. And your MOH and husband and best man et. al. need to know that you will not be diverted from being the bride. It's appropriate for the wedding ceremony to punctuate that you are not your parents' helper any more.", "They rely on you because you let them.  I know it sucks to have to be more grown-up than your parents but you're allowed to have a life and they're making things harder on themselves by not having a plan in place to help out.  They may only trust you because they've had the luxury of never needing anyone else.  Well...now they do.\n\nStop saying yes all the time, as hard as that may feel. It's what 's best for everyone.", "SO by not inviting your siblings you are making sure your parents won't come to your wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur problem is NOT the wedding. YOur problem is that you will be expected to have your siblings move in with you when your parents get too old to take care of them. YOu madees ure that is the plan by being the ONLY person your parents let near the kids. .. the wedding is a SMALL and less important thing besides that.", "Yeah the sole childcare besides your parents has to stop. Better to have them make a backup plan before they're 20 years old. \n\nYou need to know that your parents assume and expect you to also take over when they can't take care of your brothers anymore. It happened to me and it wasn't pretty.", "Oh shit, i was somehow distracted. Then i'd say NTA. OJ can maybe celebrate a second \"small wedding\" in a place his brothers feel comfortable - just eating a nice dinner together or something", "My answer would have been \"I don't want ANY children there \" turned on my heel and walked away. Its not like you'singled out your brothers and banned them, its ALL children. You're so NTA, you're parents are though.", "Also you might want to add that its a childfree wedding to your post. That is significant context that NO children are being invited.", "Ok, that definitely makes your parents TA. Stick to your guns, \"We have planned a childfree wedding. The topic is closed.\" If they try to guilt you, \"As I said the topic is closed, if you can't respect that I'm going to have to hang up.\" Then follow through. They might throw a tantrum and continue to try and guilt trip you but setting boundaries, while hard, is very important thing as an adult.", "What about a compromise? Have  your brothers at the ceremony...make it a relatively quick one? Then they go with a babysitter back home while your parents stay for your day.  Or reverse, have the brothers with a sitter during the wedding and dinner and have them come to the after-party, when the 'important' stuff is done? \n\nIs it too late to FIND a sitter? I'm sure you can help get them connected with some autism resources who help with child care.", "You CHOOSE to babysit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing your wedding to make the point will break your family apart.", "Okay. Just checking they aren\u2019t taking advantage of you. No change to my vote.", "OP specifically states that the brothers are \"loud, destructive, and get overwhelmed constantly\"", ">To top it off, they're destructive and loud and get overwhelmed constantly.\n\nIt doesn't sound like worry. It sounds like certainty.", "It comes out of love for their children - not for any other reason. I see your point though. Just a tough situation", "That detail wasn't in the post originally. And its a total game changer for what the situation is!"]}
