Not because I was afraid of gaining weight but because honestly, I love the soreness after your workout. I just wanna say my husband has never forced me to go and loved me at my highest weight (many people think my husband makes me go) Anyways, I have a sister-in-law (37) and she is married to my brother (38). They have never liked me and went out of their way to call me names and make my life hell. One thing they loved to comment on was my weight and loved to call me Ms. Piggy. Because of these comments, I started going to the gym when I was 18 and I started my first job. The comments continued until everyone saw how I bounced back after my pregnancy. \n\nSo yesterday, was my stepdad's birthday and everyone was gathered at their house, eating, and having fun. My mom commented about how good I looked and she wanted to come to the gym with me. I of course said she could because she's honestly my best friend. When me, my husband and my daughter were about to leave my SIL came up to me and asked if I could help her lose weight because she wanted to lose the extra weight from having kids. I looked her up and down then I laughed while saying I would never in hell help her but I hope she gets the help she needs so my brother doesn't leave (she would always say my boyfriend would leave because I was bigger). When I got home I've gotten a text from my brother saying that I was rude to comment on someone struggling with their weight.

And I believe I'll be fine.", "I think if you got an eating disorder you\u2019d never want to hurt someone by calling them fat. I have one too and definitely don\u2019t want to. \n\nA lot of eating disorders come from mothers, so please don\u2019t let your kids catch you slinging fat as an insult or telling people their partners won\u2019t love them and will leave them because they\u2019re fat. You don\u2019t want to give them EDs too.", "Lol you think the Ekman ehose been bullying her since she was 11 and calling her Ms. Piggy is suddenly going to see the error in her ways?", "Yeah don't listen to these ESH taking the high road hardly works well in the real world", "P.S. congratulations \ud83c\udf8a on your baby!", "NTA. Simply repeating what she\u2019s said back to her is an effective way of pointing out her bullying and how it feels", "You're not even slightly in the wrong. If she really wanted your help, she should have begun with a sincere no bullshit full responsibility apology followed by an I know I can't reasonably expect anything from you ever, but would you please consider. Then, IF you believed her and IF you saw that she experienced real growth and IF you felt like it. You owe her nothing, even if she apologized now. And she hasn't. You've worked your ass literally off to STOP being the bigger person. They can zip it!", "My child wasn't around me and I didn't call my SIL fat. I said I hope she gets the help she needs so her husband won't leave her.", "Amen to that PREACH!!!", "Thanks, babes, the sad thing is I would've helped her if she apologized for her actions.", "You were talking about the gym and her needing your help to lose weight. How is the \u201chelp she needs\u201d not help to lose weight? Unless you meant mental health counseling because she\u2019s a bully \u2014 in which case, you did *not* make that very clear. Most folks here think you said her husband would leave her because she\u2019s fat, and I have a feeling she took it that way too."]}
