Seems like a lot do money at almost 4, but it\u2019s one of the only programs in the area and she loves the idea of singing, music, etc. \n\nHere is the issue - in her class of 4, 2 of the kids are disruptive. I believe them to be neurodivergent, but don\u2019t know for sure. One child talks constantly, runs around the room knocking stuff over, and yells. The other child just wants to sing the same song over and over and screams/cries if we don\u2019t. \n\nI understand that it\u2019s a wonderful skill to learn how to interact with people from all walks of life, and actively try to teach my daughter that. We are currently learning sign language to interact with non-verbal kids, frequently discuss how some people use wheelchairs/crutches, or how all families look different. \n\nBut in this instance I\u2019m getting frustrated. My daughter sits there quietly waiting to learn, and is getting nothing out of the program. The parents of these two children don\u2019t address their kids behaviour or remove them for a breather if needed. The instructor is clearly frustrated and can\u2019t talk over the disruption. Today after class my daughter said \u201cI just want to sing and play piano but I can\u2019t at class.\u201d I explained how some people need different help or experience the world differently, but I\u2019m also totally understanding of how her experience has been. \n\nAITA for writing in and asking for it to be addressed or we will withdraw and want a full refund?

This class is more for socialization at that age, like others have recommended look for a private tutor and you\u2019ll likely find the results you\u2019re looking for. Oh and YTA btw", "As a mom of 4 (now 26,26,28,30) I believe kids should behave like kids for as long as they can. They really don\u2019t get to be kids for very long before the world starts judging them. IMO \u2026 it\u2019s really not fair or okay. They are little kids. They have no clue they\u2019re being disruptive to others. They don\u2019t know your daughter wants to sit quietly & learn. They are just being kids. The teacher is allowing these kids to be disruptive. That is the person you can hold accountable. The parents don\u2019t run the class. \n\nIf your daughter needs/wants something different then find it. You have full control of that. It\u2019s been a very long time since I have been in a room of 4 year olds but nothing you describe sounds different than what I remember\u2026 a room of 4 year olds \u2026 Total chaos.\n\neta \u2014 this is a group for 4 year old kids. I don\u2019t know what your expectations are but perhaps that\u2019s a question you should ask the teacher. What exactly will they be teaching your daughter & what are you paying for. It\u2019s a valid question. Maybe it\u2019s the wrong group.", "I see what you\u2019re saying. There\u2019s another commenter here who works with small children who also agrees that it\u2019s typical behavior. So maybe it\u2019s not so clear. It\u2019s hard to judge from one person\u2019s description. Parents stepping in is unfortunately up to the parents. People parent vastly different as I\u2019ve learned with my own kids \ud83e\udd23 Either way just seems odd for op to be so fixated and attempting to label/diagnose these kids as abnormal/ND was more so what I was trying to say.", "How do you know what the parents are doing? \n\nAre you qualified to diagnose neurological conditions?\n\nI could go on, but that\u2019s the gist. \n\nSince you\u2019re at the beginning of this parenting road, here\u2019s a tip: keep your mind and your language on what you know for sure about your own kid and what they need. \n\nYour kid needs a quieter, more focused environment. If this instructor can\u2019t provide it, find one who can. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all you need to talk about or be concerned with.", "Then tell us your history, education, and experience with four year olds. There are multiple people who are actually early childhood professionals telling you that this IS typical behavior for four year olds.        \n\nI'm a preschool teacher and deal with this *daily*. Is it frustrating at times? Absolutely. But I would never make the assumption that they are neurodivergent based solely on running around the room.", "Do go on then what are your qualifications to diagnose children that you say you just hear about from your daughter? \n\nMultiple people here have told you the behavior is normal. It seems you really want to label and target these kids instead of focusing on your daughter. If it\u2019s not the right class talk to the school. No need to be unnecessarily focused on these children that aren\u2019t your concern.", "what you described is developmentally appropriate behavior for 4.", "It is 100% typical 4 year old behavior. They are there for the enrichment of socialization and some music. At that age they are not going to get a ton of music learning outside of play. You are blessed with a unicorn child so find her a private lesson that meets her needs but honestly, the lessons are meeting the needs of the other kids in the class.", "I\u2019m sorry but your daughter is the one that does not seem like a typical 4 year old", "I get that is a lot of money but they are only 4. Is normal behavior for kids who don't have the patience for a class but the parent force them. \nLike I said if your kid really wants to learn find her a private teacher. It will be better for you (you get a better job done for your money spent) and get ( she got to learn, and probably faster).\n\nYes the parents should be responsible for the behavior of their children.", "Why not complain to the parents then?  They are right there.", "I have two favorite things happening here. One is the people who actually work with kids being like \"yeah that's normal\" and OP arguing with them.\n\nThe second is the whole paragraph about how inclusive they're trying to teach their kid, but that he jumps to autism (more or less). It  reminds me of not I'm my backyard type shit.", "I was actually thinking that OP might want to consider if their own child might be neurodivergent.", "Honestly? Two hundred bucks a month is CHEAP for child supplemental activities like that. Things like Little Maestros will cost you, like, double that at least. And at that age, a supplemental class isn't intended to turn a child into a virtuoso- it's to introduce them to fundamentals, and be an outlet of fun and bonding for kids and parents. Like I say in my comment- if OP wants her child to really learn piano, she needs to hire a private instructor. That will put her back probably somewhere between thirty and seventy bucks an hour, depending on the teacher's experience.", "Nah, that's on the parents, not the instructor. In these Mommy-and-Me style classes, it's the parents' jobs to run interference with their children. It's the instructor's job to keep things moving.", "I have ASD myself. It's not about holding children to \"standards\", it's the idea that just because children of that age might be at different levels of self-regulatory development doesn't mean that it's an inherent sign that they have a mental illness or disability.", "So if those kids try harder they be less ND? Does that also work for far sightedness because my eyes are getting awful. I guess I\u2019ll just try harder to see.", "You can hold them to any standard you want.  But the fact is 4-year olds are not always *capable* of exercising impulse control.  You do realize that a kid at this age may still have potty accidents, right?  THEY ARE FOUR.", "You need to get over the expectation -- in any arena, not just this one -- that other people will be responsible parents.\n\nSome of them will be -- but a lot of them won't. And you can wish that they would be responsible parents all day and all night until the cows come home, but that's not going to make it magically happen.\n\nYou have to accept that the only parenting and behavior you can control is your own (and, to some extent, your child's -- but you're in for a rude surprise if you don't think you're going to have to deal with your own kid rebelling and behaving badly at times).\n\nu/swishystrawberry is right -- this class is not fit for your purposes. Withdraw your child, explain why and ask for your money back (though you may only get a partial refund). Find a private tutor who can give your child the kind of instruction and environment you're seeking.", "Lady, I work and have worked with many, many children four years old and under. That kind of thing is, absolutely and unequivocally, standard four-year-old behavior. Not that every four year old always behaves the same, but those behaviors (running around and not sitting still, knocking things over, wanting to sing the same song over and over) are super duper common in kids that age. \n\nI agree that the parents should have regulated their kids more, especially the boy that was running around. If that kind of environment isn't enriching for your child, you're well within your rights to pull your child from the class and place her elsewhere. But it wasn't constructive of you to complain to the school.", "Yeah this is absolutely normal behavior and not the last time your child\u2019s learning will be disrupted by another student, for a variety of reasons. This is a great time to help your child actually practice what you claim to preach. It\u2019s all well and good to talk about differences at home, but when is a better time to put that into practice than at something low stakes like a 4 year old music class?", "Hence my response to seek private lessons, if her child is so very focused. Some are at this age. You\u2019re assuming this isn\u2019t a talented child. OP is perfectly normal to only be concerned about her child\u2019s needs. As are most parents.", "If true then she needs a private tutor who can focus only on her and develop her gift. \n\nShe'll be happier and so will you, and so will the teachers and parents of those entirely typically distractible 4 year olds in a social music class (whom you are armchair-diagnosing).\n\nYTA.", "Thank you for this! I had done research into singing lessons at her age and once I saw nothing really existed I figured going for fundamentals was a better choice. I\u2019m hoping if I find a piano teacher who can set her up well with music basics she\u2019ll a) know if she ready wants that or not and b) be set up well if she is!", "Sure!! Thank you for asking. What I\u2019ve seen from them:\n\n- running around, knocking stuff over\n- yelling \u201ci wanna do that song again\u201d at the top of their lungs and crying for 15 min (after we did the song 4x)\n- babbling in non-discernible \u201cwords\u201d loudly overtop of the teacher while trying to instruct constantly (not once or twice during the class)\n- parents bringing out another toy for them to play with during the class \n- screaming loudly while crying and kicking \n- drooling (this doesn\u2019t affect us whatsoever, but many people are claiming I\u2019m being an AH for assuming possible neurodivergence, and this is just another reason for my suspicion)", "It was wrong to label those kids the way she did and her daughter may belong in a different class or private lessons. I do think the other parents should be more responsive to addressing their children\u2019s behavior.", "Here's the thing: even *professionals* ***cannot*** *diagnose children this young because this behaviour is normal for children in this age range.* Ironically, I'd say *OP's child* better fits the idea for a neurodivergent than the others. It sounds to me more like these two other kids are those who are being forced into this class when they'd rather be playing with dolls/doing something active, and so are having trouble turning an interest in more active pursuits to something that's quieter. They are full of beans, and aren't being given the chance to expend it in a constructive manner. That's normal for a 4 year old. OP's child sounds more akin to a potentially autistic individual, if you wanted to apply the tick-boxes to a kid so young (which professionals won't and don't!). She's quiet, sits fairly still, and is upset that they didn't get to do what she expected she was going to do. Those are habits seen in (older) autistic children. While it's also not uncharacteristic of a child that young, if OP wants to fling around the basic sterotypes.... then every child in that room showed symptoms.", "I know what the parents are doing because it\u2019s a parented class. The kid today was running around, knocking over the music stand during the middle of a lesson (other kids sitting at their keyboard). The dad said/did nothing. He brought out a toy for the kid to play with when he came back over, which the kid then continued to disrupt the class with. The other child I would say with 99% certainty has divergence. In some cases you just know, but I won\u2019t get into that seeing as I\u2019m just being crucified for it anyway. \n\nMy daughter has 10 cousins - 5 of which are within a year of her. And all of them behave markedly better than what we have seen from the 2 kids in this class. I\u2019m actually trying to assume the best that they may have struggles that can\u2019t be controlled by parenting or willpower.", "One of them doesn\u2019t speak words and is babbling loudly over the teacher while running and knocking stuff over. Constant drooling while crying and screaming. Motor deficiencies in the other child but verbal and seems sensitive to sound and instruction. \n\nSo yeah \u2026 I\u2019m no fucking early childhood psychologist but I can tell you right now unless all the other 6 parented classes my kid has been in, along with their daycare/preschool classes, are composed of abnormally well behaved, articulate, and talented children\u2026. This one IS different.", "my favourite was when she said the other kids \u201chave divergence\u201d", "Exactly. While professionals don't and won't try to diagnose a kid that young, being quiet and being upset when something doesn't go the way they are told (ie, telling an autistic kid you're going to shop a, shop b, then stop at gregs, then go to shop c, but then swapping it to going to gregs, then shop b, then shop a, then c), kinda sticks to me, mainly because my foster brother was severely autistic (they knew cos he didn't talk until 4), and that's exactly what he was like. It wasn't always a massive freakout like people assume, just ***deep*** confusion and discomfort when things got switched around or didn't happen", "Not accusing them of mental illness or disability but definitely saying they aren\u2019t good enough. I was treated appallingly badly for being non-standard but really it should\u2019ve been these tykes getting a hard time instead.", "Complaining to the school may lead them to have the children not ready for the class removed.  The parents should have removed the children from the room when they would not behave only returning when ready to behave.", ">You\u2019re assuming this isn\u2019t a talented child.\n\nI'm not assuming that at all. If this is a talented child then a group music program was never the best choice!\n\nI reiterate that OP's expectations of the program were highly unrealistic and her scolding of the teachers and amateur assessments of the other children's behaviour make her TAH here.", "You are again, describing an average 4 year old. It\u2019s likely that these children don\u2019t have any particular interest in music and their parents signed them up. (I don\u2019t think 4 year olds tend to have interests that last over a few months.) Focusing on only their favorite songs or wanting to play with toys is normal. Atm my 4 y/o cousin is obsessed w/ Taylor Swift and listens to Look what you made me do on repeat.", "What the hell does drooling have to do with neurodivergence. Instead of idk a 4 year old maybe loosing a tooth or having one break through?", "The only reason my cousins got diagnosed so young 4ish(?) is because they had high-support needs. Things that were obvious to anyone (wouldn\u2019t respond to their names, non-verbal, literally wouldn\u2019t interact). Otherwise a 4 year old can\u2019t really be looked into.", "To be completely honest, saying someone \"has divergence\" really reveals how you are underqualified to make that call.", "No one cares. Again - it\u2019s none of your business. None. Zero. Can it. Figure out what your kid needs. Get that for them. Assume whatever, but keep it to yourself. \n\nOr don\u2019t. Be the local judgeypants. See how well that serves your child as the years go on.", "\"The kid knocked over the music stand and the dad did nothing. He brought out a toy...\" Oh, so he tried to redirect the kid to a less destructive behavior? Nice.\n\nYTA, It sounds like this class isn't what you're looking for. That's a 'you' problem. Go get private lessons instead of trying to make the instructor enforce whatever standards you prefer. This whole post is basically, \"I have no problem with neurodivergent people, as long as they act normal in public.\"", "Reread what you said. Think about it real hard.\n\nAnd realize that maybe, if you think other kids (four year old at that!) deserve to be bullied, then maybe the problem actually is you.", "Sub Rule 12. This isn\u2019t a Debating Society. We have differing opinions. End of.", "It\u2019s not drilling in the sense of getting a tooth. It\u2019s constant drooling as in wearing a bib.", "Gonna start presenting my diagnosis this way.", "Nobody is saying to bully the children, but to refuse to tolerate certain behaviors and to discipline them when they misbehave.", "Sure, but don't attribute assumptions I haven't expressed."]}
