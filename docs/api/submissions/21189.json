I told her she needed to hear me out fully, before she spoke, and thankfully she did. \n\nIn short, I told her as much as I love her, I\u2019ve waited years for this day, and it was MINE. She had hers, and if she truly wanted she could have used the money I gifted her to get her own wedding. Her husband to cut me off and say that they needed the money for rent, but she didn\u2019t let him talk. \n\nI showed her the Reddit post, and she started crying, and asked her husband and my fianc\u00e9 to step out for a few minutes. They both did, and she told me her husband and our mom had been the ones pressuring her, since she had admittedly been jealous, and told them both she wished she could have a larger scale wedding. She said she had been over the whole thing, until her husband started saying it wasn\u2019t fair because HE was jealous he couldn\u2019t provide for her, and eventually complained enough she asked to walk down the aisle for him. \n\nStacy said she was willing to fully back out of the wedding, and would understand given the heartache she\u2019s given me, but I told her that her husband would be the one without an invite, which she gratefully agreed to.\n\n We talked more in depth on why she was jealous, and she said she regretted being married so early just so our father could be at her wedding. After a few more minutes and both of us crying and forgiving one another, I told her she could always tell me anything, even if it was between her and her husband.\n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9 and her husband came back in, I told Stacy\u2019s husband he was uninvited, right then and there, and he seemed to understand why immediately, though he did groan about it, and call me multiple times, but I blocked him. (Again) \n\nOver the past few days, our mother has called to apologize, and me and Stacy have been talking much more openly and honestly to one another. \n\nI decided to let her wear a dark silver or pale gold dress (to match my theme) and walk WITH me down the aisle, as my father sadly can\u2019t. She told me I didn\u2019t need to, but I insisted. (We ended up finding a dress we both love, and I got it as a gift for her)\n\nThank you all for the support and kind words!", "created_utc": 1688346623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14p4tf8/update_aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_walk_down/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Love this update ty!", "This is a touching update.

My mom's baby brother walked her down the aisle at her wedding because her father was no longer alive, so siblings absolutely can give you away at your wedding!", "What? A positive update where people actually acted mature? This isn't the Reddit I know. I come for the chaos. \n\n/s", "Thank you! I hope so too!", "Thank you!", "I\u2019m happy too! I feel this is a step towards a better relationship between me and my sister!", "Thank you so much!", "Thank you very much! Other than this one problem, the wedding should go smoothly!", "Hey, silver is just as traditional as white for weddings, but that tradition is super old and a lot of people don't know it. So if she wants to do something that SHE knows is a weddingish dress, but that most of the guests won't know, and if you're okay with that, I would go with silver. \ud83d\ude42", "Yes, that\u2019s why I recommend it! I thought it could be a bit of a \u201cbetween us\u201d thing that if people know, it\u2019s ok, but other will just assume it\u2019s a pretty dress!", "I think that's awesome and your sister is very lucky to have you!"]}
