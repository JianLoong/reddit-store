I told him that I was really busy so it would depend on the date, but not in September, as I have a big exam on the last week. At that point, I got mad because he never considers how busy I am.\n\nHe didn't mention it again until 4 days ago, when he told me that he's going on a vacation with his sister for a week. Wednesday next week is our anniversary.\n\nI got really angry with him because he didn't tell me he was leaving, and he didn't include me in the plan at any point. He argues that he did tell me as I told him I was busy. We fought because I consider that he was hiding it from me and he should at least have told me when he was leaving, and he should have chosen a different week.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT FOR INFO:\n\n1. He knows our anniversary is on Wednesday (Sept, 20). We usually celebrate.\n2. I told him I had a very important exam on the 26 of September. This exam has been set for 3 months. He knew when the exam was all along.\n3. He did the same thing last year when I was starting a new project at work in a new team and department. He knew that I could not get leave days on that specific week as it was my starting week. Regardless he chose that week to take a vacation even though I had specifically asked for him to change dates.\n4. We live apart. I always make time for special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.) We sometimes spend more than a week apart due to our busy schedules. He only works and does not study. We actually have by law a minimum of 22 leave days a year.\n5. He implied when he decided what leave days to take that he wanted to spend with me our anniversary.\n6. Neither of us have children.\n7. I am NOT in school/university. I do not get a rest from studying during summer. I am trying to pass a competition to work for the government, which is quite difficult.\n8. I am not  mad that he's gone on our anniversary, although it obviously makes me sad. I am mad because he did not have the decency to tell me.\n9.

Ultimately, he\u2019s unhappy with the time you\u2019re spending away from him and he\u2019s finding ways to punish you.\n\nThe two of you must absolutely have premarital counseling if you want to continue with the relationship.
