Not LC go NC.\n\nHe's upset 1) because you finally talked back to him, he's shook! that someone he's been able to abuse for 20 years finally opened their mouth. 2) He's upset because the truth hurts. \n\nAnd you're not wrong, the whole son thing is just for the name, when you have kids, you're still going to have children that are genetically related to your AH father and AH half-brother. Unless you decide to keep your AH father's name and pass that on to your kids, the only different thing the AH half-brother can give his kids is the name.", "NTA. I am autistic and so is my 18 y/o son. Being nasty and petty is not a symptom of autism and I'm sick of people using it as an excuse for nastiness because it makes the rest of us look bad. Especially the way autistic men are excused for being nasty to women.\n\nBoils my blood. My autistic friends (I have a lot of them) are among the sweetest people I know. Autistic people tend to be extremely ethical (not all of them, but there are studies showing we don't bend our ethics when no one is looking in order to benefit ourselves).\n\nYour half-brother is an entitled a-hole and your dad and his wife have raised him that way. Autism is not a pass to be sexist or mean.", "NTA. You didn't cause him to have a melt down, number one. You weren't antagonizing him or something. It's go from LC to NC with this guy. Just doesn't seem worth it.", "Are you a Targaryan? Isn't this the plotline from House of the Dragons?\n\nAnyway NTA, but your whole family needs counselling, bad, everything is toxic.", "NTA. Autism isn\u2019t an excuse to be an asshole. The sooner he learns that, the better off he\u2019ll be in life.", "NTA. But you should consider to NOT give your AH father a grandson but to cut contact and keep the toxicity out of any future children's lives.", "NTA - live by the sword, die by the sword. If he can\u2019t take critics in kind then he shouldn\u2019t be doing it. You called him out and that\u2019s his problem. I\u2019d reply to that other sister and tell her that and to not ever contact you again. That side of the family are pure 100% asshole.", "NTA. Really his autism is incidental to him being a, well, asshole. Sounds like he inherited your father's hatred and disrespect of women and has no idea how to handle being stood up to by one.", "NTA. \nIt looks like your dad and his wife are using him to abuse you and hide it behind \u201csocial struggles\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t believe the half brother is to blame either. Your dad sounds abusive and looks like he\u2019s raising another one to be like him.\n\nCut these people out. Go NC.", "NTA. And, someone needed to tell him his behaviour is why he isn't in a relationship.", "NTA. He needed to hear this, don't even feel bad.  I'd also go no contact with him and your dad for treating you this way.", "Nta", "NTA!", "NTA..he has a learned behavior that women are \"less\". He fucked around and found out.", "NTA - that was not a kind thing to say  BUT he started it, and he's been 'starting it' for decades.  His parents should have let him know that kind of behavior is unacceptable back when it first started.  \n\nUnless you're leaving something out - you didn't make this about Autism.  You told him the truth: that he's a misogynistic jerk and women don't like that.  It sounds like it hit home.  He wouldn't be so upset if there wasn't truth to it.\n\nYou feel bad because you are a decent person.  Block his number and any social media interaction.  Take the LC down to NC.", "NTA! I'd have done worse and trashed him in public just for the extra humiliation!", "NTA", "NTA.
