She was almost certainly two different ferrets. When Lucky was nice she looked slightly different than when she was mean. This revelation hit me like an anvil so I immediately confronted my roommate about it. He confessed that he actually had two ferrets (Lucky and Domino) and that he thought I wouldn\u2019t agree to room with him if I knew.

I used to work at an EMS company, in the admin offices for the second half of my tenure there. The admin office shared space with one of the ambulance bases, and one of the medics had a ferret that, for reasons unknown to me, he felt the need to bring to work. Why he got a ferret as a pet when he worked either 48 or 72 hours at a time is beyond me, but he got a ferret as a pet. And that thing STANK. He'd keep it in the \"medic room\" (the bunk room for the primary care/paramedic on the ambulance--the driver had a separate room) and by the end of the first week or so, as HR, I started getting complaints from the crews after shift change when the oncoming medic would go into the room behind him and his ferret and the room would stink. And there wasn't great ventilation in there, either, so the smell would linger for days, and it'd finally mostly go away just in time for the medic to come back in for his next shift with the ferret and start all over again. And, of course, the smell started permeating the rest of the offices until patients couldn't even come in to pay their bill without noticing the smell.\n\nI started getting SO many complaints from the crews on the opposite shift, and I kept going to the owner about it, because the medic in question was a sexist asshole who'd never listen to me if I spoke to him about it, but the owner didn't have the balls to tell him not to bring his ferret to work (even though, in the employee handbook, it explicitly forbade pets at work because we'd already had an issue with someone bringing their dog and letting it shit all over the place at one of the bases). No idea why the owner let this particular medic violate the rules with impunity--still makes me wonder what the heck that medic had on him--but the only way it stopped was because the ferret got sick and died. That's when the office was finally aired out and it didn't smell like dirty-ass ferret anymore.", "Think of the smell!!", "I suspect keeping 10 ferrets locked in 1 room is probably a sign this could be an abusive situation :(", "Yes, that sounds disturbing. However, I'd never call AC if I don't know for sure that pets are neglected or abused.", "Tbh the main reason I suspect this might be made up is because the smell of that many ferrets would be unbearable. No way he didn\u2019t know", "aye, someone decided it would be a good idea to gift me a ferret when I was 5. he was a delightful little dude but I wasn't allowed to keep him because the smell was POWERFUL. mom had to scrub down the whole cage with heavy duty cleaners every few days to keep the whole house from reeking, and he was just a baby. even as a kid I was like yeah, that's fair, lol. shame tho, they really are cute", "Yea they're def outside enclosure pets IMO", "Oh yeah if you have ferrets you should really bathe them occasionally. They're not like cats, they get stinky without baths. Also I'm pretty sure you can have their stink glands removed when you get them fixed but don't quote me on that.", "I feel that, It's why I only said consider.", "NTA. I used to have 3 of these little stink monsters,  I can smell this post and my last one died 10yrs ago", "NTA. That is super weird. Lying is he biggest red flag", "Definitely NTA.    \nAs someone who works in the pet trade, ferrets need to be kept in pairs for their well-being, but lying about having ten of them is not on at all.  And even when they are descented (have had their scent glands removed), they still smell bad.  They are cute and hilarious, but I wouldn't want them as pets.", "NTA.\n\nThere may have been ten cute weasels, but the tall lying one is certainly an AH.", "He knows noone will be willing to live with 10 ferrets and thus lied to OP and would have continued to lie to hide the previous lie.\n\nOP you're NTA. BLOCK HIS ASS.", "You are absolutely right about the smell, but ferrets sold as pets are usually spayed or neutered as babies (at least in Canada, so I'm guessing the same is true in the US).   \n\n\nI can't believe he lied about having that many. Wow.", "I mean they smell pretty bad but otherwise not much. It\u2019s mostly the lying that bothers me", "Not only do they smell, but if they're not desexed, you're going to be getting a bunch of babies. If female ferrets go into heat without having sex, they will die. So you can't just keep them separate. I can almost guarantee that these ferrets aren't desexed. That may even by how the housemate has ended up with 10 ferrets.", "Eh , if you feed them a good diet they don\u2019t smell much, like the diet makes a HUGE difference. People who come into my one room apartment always comment on how my three ferrets don\u2019t smell. Most people feed ferrets trash though.", "It takes a while. My sib has ferrets and lived with me for a couple years. The ferrets stayed in their room. They kept the cage and litter boxes cleaned regularly, but after they moved out it took literal years for the smell to fade (they moved out in 2020), and I'm truly not sure it's entirely gone. No carpets or textiles in that room, and we scrubbed the walls and floor with enzymatic cleaner after they moved, but the smell persisted, especially when it got warm. There are a couple fleece blankets around that had been used in the ferret cage that now get used with our pets, and they still have an odor through many washes with detergent, pet odor laundry boost, white vinegar... It's a smell that lasts.", "Right! Like neon tetras or male guppies.", "I used to know someone that had 2 ferrets and damn do those things smell! I always had a hard time being in the house for too long because my allergies would go crazy. I can't imagine being in a house with 10 of them. Also ferrets have just insane personalities, nice one second, trying to kill you the next and super high energy. Literally the worst pet IMHO!", "Nta", "NTA \n\nYour roommate is a liar. That alone is more than enough reason ro remove yourself from the situation.", "Not the NTA, I lived with a person who brang rats home. She used my towels to cover the cage. They stank and she left the stank for days and used my stuff for insulation. First chance I had I took it.", "NTA but I can see why he'd feel compelled to lie--it's gotta be impossible to find someone willing to live with ten ferrets. I loved my ferret but I had to rehome it because my husband could not stand the smell. Which is fair because it was a lot. You shouldn't be expected to live with a liar though.", "INFO: Does your roommate have a long grey beard and smoke a pipe? Does he sometimes call himself \"Wielder of the flame of Anor?\" Because this reads like Gandalf introducing the dwarfs and hobbits in small groups to Beorn.", "people never have just one ferret! They always have 6-10 of them! I used to work at a vet and no amount of cuteness could get me to live with that smell!", "Ferrets and weasels are distantly related but they are two different animals. Ferrets are larger, domesticated, and docile. Weasels have longer tails, and are more aggressive.\n\nSo yeah, 10 ferrets + 10 weasels = 20 animals.", "It's a good point that being neutered it'd be limited at ten (\"just\" ten LOL). You're right to point that out, with my background it didn't even occur to me ^^U\n\n(off-topic, I know, but. I grew up countryside, and all the animals I've been surrounded by always breed as they please; in fact, owners often arrange them to because they want a next generation, when it comes to ferrets or dogs -there's a rabbit infestation of epic proportions and people use them to hunt-. So neutering an animal has always sounded more cruel to me than a lot of the things the likes of peta complains about...)\n\nAnd yes, the deal-breaker point for me is the continuing lies. I would not have moved in with someone with 10 ferrets lol (I have enough of that in my hometown!), but if someone lied to me like this about an important part of our living arrangement, no matter what it was... I would be looking into my chances of moving out. Luckily, \"waaaaaay more ferrets than advertised\" is something a landlord should understand easily LOL.\n\n(edited because of a typo smh)", "I agree the lying is the biggest problem.   \n \"So neutering an animal has always sounded more cruel to me than a lot of the things the like of peta complains about...)\"  \n\n\nTo be honest, I've generally thought the opposite-that animals kept as pets should always be spayed or neutered (especially dogs and cats, but rabbits if they will be kept together, ferrets, etc).  There simply aren't homes for all the animals produced when they are allowed to keep breeding unregulated. Millions of dogs and cats are euthanized in shelters across North America every day because of this.", "With proper care, the natural musk of ferrets isn\u2019t that terrible. It\u2019s when they aren\u2019t properly taken care of that they have that pee stank."]}
