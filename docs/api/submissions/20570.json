We had spoken for months before this and seemed to have a lot in common. He told me ahead of time that he had a ferret named Lucky. He sent me a lot of videos and pictures and overall she seemed like a cute pet. I\u2019ve heard bad things about ferrets, but I ignored them because my roommate seemed cool and Lucky was adorable. In person, she was even cuter so I didn\u2019t think much about it.\n\nA few weeks into living with him I noticed that Lucky was bipolar. Not literally, but it seemed like sometimes she was playful and nice while others she was more aggressive. Again I chose to ignore this because I knew very little about ferrets so it\u2019s possible that they were just like that. But as I got to know Lucky I realized something. She was almost certainly two different ferrets. When Lucky was nice she looked slightly different than when she was mean. This revelation hit me like an anvil so I immediately confronted my roommate about it. He confessed that he actually had two ferrets (Lucky and Domino) and that he thought I wouldn\u2019t agree to room with him if I knew. I was a little peeved but forgave him for lying and didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it. However, I remained suspicious which led to the next revelation.\n\nPart of me thought that my roommate was still lying so I did a little investigating. For context, we rent a house and he lives upstairs while I live in the basement. I couldn\u2019t (and generally wouldn\u2019t) snoop in his room mostly because he locked his door. I originally thought this was totally acceptable but by then I thought it was suspicious. What really tipped me off was that the Instagram profile where we mostly talked only had pictures of Lucky, which is why I didn\u2019t think he had two ferrets. I dug around looking for alternate pages but couldn\u2019t find any. Then I remembered him deliberately asking if I used TikTok (I didn\u2019t) and checked there. And, my god. This man had a TikTok account where he showed off his TEN ferrets. TEN weasels that had been living under my roof for months at that point. \n\nI confronted him again and this time he was much more defensive. He was mad that I didn\u2019t believe him the first time even though he was still lying. I told him that if he had just told me about the ferrets right away, I may have been ok with it (probably not, but maybe). But now that I couldn\u2019t trust him, I couldn\u2019t live with him. I called the land lord and broke my lease. I\u2019m staying on a friend\u2019s couch for now but my roommate keeps blowing up my phone, cussing me out.

You are trustworthy, so you automatically give the benefit of believing someones words, when sharing information. You had not gone snooping or trespassing into his part of the house until you wanted to get to the bottom of why it stank so much after finding out Lucky wasn\u2019t always Lucky, but a finally admitted to, other animal, Domino.  \nOn the other hand, the roommate has proven he is a lying liar who lies. Right off the bat from the beginning of your meeting him. He is obviously trying to hide everything about his multiple ferret ownership, while subjecting your use of the other areas of the house to the strong odor his animal hoarding has produced. Probably because no landlord would allow this from a tenant, especially a new one moving in. He has set up fake photo pages of him and his one ferret to create the illusion to anyone of authority over this aspect in his life (landlord, roomies) to complete the false front he presents.  \n\n\nFerrets stink, and I doubt they are all little angels who are all litter trained. They probably crap all over the place when let out of their cages. It\u2019s your valid and personal choice not to want to live in a house that the animal stink can penetrate your own hair and clothing and make you smell like a walking zoo, yourself.  \nN T A", "If they're in the US they're more than likely spayed and neutered unless they came from a private breeder.

Are you sure dude isn't really a horde of ferrets in a trenchcoat?  Anyway, you are definitely NTA.

I did have to ask him to clean up his beard shavings once but other than that nothing too bad", "Even without any restrictions in the lease, many cities have restrictions on how many pets are allowed in a residence.
