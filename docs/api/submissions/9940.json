First, it's never okay to make fun of someone because of how they talk. That's bullying. Just accept that some people like to be a little quirky with their words. It's not hurting anybody. Second, an ACL tear is serious and very painful. So, you're kicking your cousin while she's down. That's not cool. How old are you that you can't read a room?\n\nEDIT: I just looked at your ages. You are bullying your much younger cousin. And for the record, she's 11. She's still trying to find her individuality and she's mimicking what she sees and hears and adopting it because at 11, italics are *everything.*", "Wtf. Yes YTA. No debate. A little girl badly injured herself and you expressly needled them with something childish. You behave like you are the 11 year old.", "You're lucky her brother only cussed you out.

She\u2019s 11 years old you donkey. She\u2019s using words that sound cool to her just like you probably did once", "YTA. Honestly, your timing sucks and you're a sucky older cousin. She's 11! She's going to speak preteen lingo. Leave her alone, after you apologize.", "YTA - anytime the word \"mocking\" is accurate to describe a behavior it makes the person doing the mocking an AH.

How could you possibly think you're not the asshole????", "bro, GROW UP. YTA.", "YTA\n\nStop making fun of your cousin, she\u2019s so much younger than you. Im surprised you only got cussed out", "YTA. An ultra, super AH. This is your cousin, who is younger than you. You probably have your own lame habits.

You\u2019re the type of person who made me feel ashamed of being excited or any emotion while I was growing up. I still get told how I was \u201cJuSt SOOOOOO mUcH\u201d when I was a kid.
