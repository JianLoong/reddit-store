I did have an actual present to open, they wrapped a box with a card that had a message about them paying for my school and stuff, so essentially that my \"present\" was going to be paying for my tuition.

I feel like my parents promised me that they would pay for my tuition when I was younger, and now it feels like they're using it as an excuse not to get me anything. I told my mom that this year I wanted a watercolor paint set, because I like to paint as a hobby, and it seemed like she was listening and I really thought I was going to get something like that.\n\nWhen I opened my \"present\" yesterday I was obviously really happy that they were going to help me, but when I saw my brother get his PS5 and some other stuff, I kind of grumbled that I didn't get any real presents to open myself. My mom noticed I was upset, and asked me what was wrong. I told her I was  sad I didn't get any presents to open and my dad immediately jumped to my mom's defence and said my present is a lot more expensive than a PS5.

I get what your saying.  Even a $5 gift would be nice just to have something tangible esp compared to a ps5. You could've reacted a little better but yes you are 17.

Paying your school tuition is a HUGE gift but you\u2019re still a kid and your parents should have realized that it sucks not to have anything to open.", "NTA. Will your tuition be all your gifts for all things until you graduate?", "NTA\n\nFood, housing and clothing are basic needs that parents provide for kids.  Tuition is a bit different as it's somewhat optional but still same category of non-fun life stuff.\n\nYou don't give a kid a bill for heating and water and groceries and tell them it's a Christmas gift. \n\nChristmas gifts are for fun, optional bonus things. It's great your parents are paying your tuition. And it might make things a bit tight for them. But in that case, the kind thing to do is tell you, in advance, that they will be paying tuition and so it'll be a little tougher at Christmas and you should expect a smaller gift than usual and smaller than your brother.\n\nThen they can get you some chocolate, a couple good books,  fun craft, cute jewelry and maybe a book of photos of you from 0 to 17. That'll come in as a fraction of your brother's gift but gives you nice memories and a way to spend your day.\n\nI'm sorry your parents did that.\n\nHowever, it's worth telling yourself that overall, they might be a bit callous but you are in a much better position with paid tuition and no shiny gifts. Think of it as your parents caring for you but not being great with affection. Does that sound like them?", "YTA, you are comparing yourself to a 13 year old. When he is your age and college bound, whose to say he's going to get a gift. His gift may be the same as yours, free ride to college.  Wow some kids are just so greedy and are takers. Let's see when you have a child if you pay for their college. I highly doubt you will and will have a ton of excuses as to why not. \nMy parents didn't give me a dime for college but yet paid half for my brother. Oh and I always got crappy gifts compared to him. Their excuse because he was older. Even now they give him money but I never ask for anything as I pay my own way.", "NAH. But hopefully when it's time to pay for your brother's tuition, you'll get a present and he won't! If that's not the case you might have reason to be upset.", "Soft YTA. Even when I was a kid, I would gave given up every birthday and Christmas present for 5 years to get my college paid for and been really happy about it. That being said it doesn't seem like they are hurting for money, so a small present would have been thoughtful.", "Every Christmas from now on get them the same card telling them someday you\u2019ll be contributing to their retirement home/care and that is their gift.", "At 17, I got sweaters and then had to pay my own college tuition. Gentle YTA \nI'm sure if you wanted to pay your own college expenses, your parents could take that hundred grand and buy you a game system", "100% YTA. Your brother might get his school paid for but did you get gifts at 13 and also get your school paid for. \n\nLife isn\u2019t fair, most people don\u2019t have their parents pay for their schooling. \n\nI\u2019d be thinking if I were them, fu*k it, here\u2019s your water colours, pay for your own school.", "YTA. You DID get to open a present, your parents wrapped up you tuition and allowed you to open it! I would give my left hand to have my anyone pay my tuition. You have no idea what an amazing gift this is. Solution, decline tuition, pay 50k in tuition and loans and ask that they get you an art set. I am willing to bet that it costs a whole lot less than what they offered you. Or, I will buy you an art set and your parents can pay my tuition ( 60k a year, not including books and lab fees). Even your brother knew you were being entitled.", "YTA. While it sucks, this is a gift that will set so much of your life up for you should you not squander it. You will have little to no education debt to start your adult life. \n\nThis is a bigger gift than you can imagine. It\u2019s rarer than you think. Not all parents can do that for their kids. Not all parents do that for their kids. Imagine what your parents could have done with that money and they are doing for you instead. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge sacrifice. And you\u2019re worried about a paint set. I\u2019m sure your parents would jump at trading tuition for a paint set.  Think about it. You are not owed this. It comes with sacrifice. In a few years they may not be able to do it for your brother.", "YTA. You are not entitled to have your parents pay for your college, and that is the most expensive gift any parent can give. 100000 times a PS5. You are very fortunate they even can because for the majority of people that is a debt as big as a car or even a house if you get more than a bachelor's. Would you have been more grateful if they never told you they planned to pay for it? \nYes it's nice to open lots of presents but that's not your problem, your brother getting a PS5 was. I bet you would still be disappointed if they gave you a few small things first. Yes a PS5 is fun but won't last but a few years. Setting you up with great education and no debt is the biggest and best of all! A lifetime of better chance at happiness! Please grow up and thank your parents before they change their minds about supporting you as there is no obligation after 18.", "YTA\n\n\nI get the disapointment but college is a really big gift.", "I mean, and please don't take this the wrong way, but that's definitely a 17yo thing to do. You're right on the edge of both childhood and adulthood and it's a hard transition. You don't know the pure stress and exhaustion of having debt that you're solely responsible for. Your parents do,  and they can't really expect you to be excited about something you have no experience being excited for, if that makes sense. They have a right to be upset, though, if they feel you're not grateful. You'll appreciate it eventually. NAH.", "You got a present when you were 13. He deserves it too. He isnt at that stage of life yet. YTA.", "YTA. Tuition is a lot more than a PlayStation. You\u2019re lucky they\u2019re helping you with school and should be grateful for that. It\u2019s more than enough as a gift.", "YTA. You got presents every year up until tuition, why should he not get anything now that they'll be spending up to 5 digits on you this next year?? That's being childish. \n\n\nIf you're in the US tuition is a crippling amount of cash that many folks can't spring for to give to their kids.", "YTA.  That's a pretty amazing gift.  Your parents are not responsible for paying for your entire university.  Do you not understand how many people would be absolutely thrilled with this?  \n\n> So I said \"If you're paying for my school now I feel like you'll pay for my brother's school eventually too, so why does he get something and I don't?\n\nAnd you got a gift when you were 13 too, no ?", "NTA your feelings are valid and you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for being upset.", "Even a few cheap, small presents is better than being left out at Christmas, right? I don't know what your parents' financial situation is, but you don't leave your kids out at Christmas, going to college or not. Their gift to you is incredibly generous, but what are they going to do going forward? No birthday presents? No Christmas presents next year and the year after? No, that's not right. I can almost see their logic, but their college gift is either going to be their excuse for never buying you anything again until you graduate or it's just going to make this Christmas suck.\n\nNTA.", "YTA.", "YTA. Maybe they\u2019ll let you pay your tuition and get you some Christmas presents instead. I feel like you don\u2019t realize how life changing it is to have your tuition paid. Having no student loans after college vs having them can change your life 100%x", "Do you have any idea much more value a decent education is vs a PS5? YTA. Grow up, get job with your education and you can buy whatever video games you want.", "YTA", "YTA. You did receive a gift. If you use it well you can get a great job and buy every game system out there!", "YTA. Stop being selfish. Your parents are doing you a HUGE favor and paying for your tuition. You could have been shackled with years of debt from furthering your education, but because of your parents you won\u2019t have to worry about that. You get to start off after college a step ahead of most people. You claim they\u2019ll probably pay for your brother\u2019s but what if they can\u2019t? Or what if they do and because they pay his that year, they don\u2019t get him anything extra and you get something that year instead? Stop acting like you\u2019re 7 and not 17.", "ESH. Paying for you tuition is a big gift, but they could have gotten you something small to open.", "ESH. Your tuition costs a hell of a lot more than 10 PS5's but they could have bought you a token present anyway.", "Maybe they should have given you $500 for a PS5 and called it a day instead of paying for your tuition. \nYou seem very ungrateful, unable to comprehend which is the biggest gift out of jealousy. You can always get a part time job and buy it yourself. \n\nWhat AH.", "YTA\n\nYou're on the edge of adulthood and should be phasing out of expecting gifts from your parents at Christmas. With that said, they are giving you a huge gift. They do not owe you college tuition. They are saving you thousands in debt. I had to put myself through school and the student loan debt was crippling. If I was given a free college education I would have been so grateful and never asked for anything again.", "It\u2019s a little bit ESH, and a little bit NAH. \n\nWhy I think it\u2019s a little ESH:\n\nFirst, equating your 13yo brother getting a PS5 to you getting a college education that will cost upwards of $50k is ridiculous. Expecting that his gifts should end at 13 for his future education while yours didn\u2019t end until 17 is also ridiculous. \n\nYour parents not discussing this with you in advance is a Dick move. Frankly, the cost and expectations of where those costs come from should have been discussed when you started to apply to schools. Are they planning to cover 100% of your costs? Just classes and fees? Housing? All 4 years or just 1? These are all things that all 3 of you should know going into applying, because frankly, the school you choose will have a huge impact on the cost. \n\nAnd why I partially don\u2019t think there are any AH\u2019a here:\n\nYou\u2019re 17- of course you were expecting a normal Christmas, and had a normal reaction to realizing you didn\u2019t get one. You also had a normal jealous reaction to seeing your brother get something big and immediate. \n\nAnd your parents are either willing to dip tremendously into their savings, or go into debt to make sure you have a good head start in life. You\u2019re young, and don\u2019t know just how much that can mean. If you were to take out a $20k loan for 1 year of classes, that loan wound compound, meaning as it incurs interest, you get more interest added on because of past interest. For every month no payment is made, the amount grows quickly. It\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility for someone to make regular payments and still be working at paying it off 20 years later. It\u2019s sadly quite common. \n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t really think they suck either, though their decision to exclude you from any conversation or choice does suck.", "OP, YTA. \n\nYour parents have just handed you adult life without student loans. That is HUGE.", "NTA As a parent to a 17 year old heading off to college, who also had a much smaller than normal Christmas, I\u2019m disappointed in your parents going to the dollar store and buying you a water color set. You should let go of your resentment towards your brother unless this year\u2019s gift was way more extravagant than normal holiday gifts.", "NTA, they could have gotten you the watercolor set or something else that\u2019s much less expensive than the tuition. Very nice gift but wouldn\u2019t really feel like Christmas without even a single other \u201cfun\u201d gift especially when you\u2019re 17 imo", "YTA. A major one. Smart enough to get into university, not smart enough to appreciate the absolute GIFT you\u2019ve been given. Education is expensive. \n\nIf you drop out or fail, you gonna pay them back for the wasted money, or will it be a \u201cgift\u201d then?", "NTA. Your parents had told you a long time ago for years that they planned to pay for your tuition. If paying your tuition later this year means they don\u2019t want to give you gifts in Christmas it would have been kinder to tell you that before Christmas morning.\n\nYour mother sounds like she realizes her mistake and why it would hurt your feelings.", "Nta. Personally I think like tuition should always be kept separate from Xmas gifts.  Unless you paid for it yourself initially and they were paying it off for you as the gift or something like that.  Not even socks/underwear?", "NTA.\nWill they be telling you \"but we're paying/paid your tuition\" until the day you die? Christmas and birthdays?", "I totally understand. I feel like parents just don't understand their kids sometimes. It's not that you didn't like the gift you got you just felt jealous and that's completely fine, you were just being human and I think your parents just made it a big issue when it was just how you felt. You didn't ask to feel that way that was just your human reaction. And it's normal.", "NTA. I know it's easy to fell left out when someone gets something really nice while you get some less less nice or in this case nothing. Especially when you ask for something like paints, which is *much* cheaper and easier to get than a PS5. But it's pretty your folks used paying for your tuition as an excuse to skimp on you, and that is not cool.", "NTA I assume that your parents talked about paying for college prior to Christmas morning. This is a gift, but not a Christmas gift. Do they mean to not give any birthday gifts again? No Christmas gifts for how many years? Never a valentine? If so, you are correct, brother should not get gifts either. This is just weird.", "YTA.", "Eh, this is a tough one. Obviously paying for schooling is a huge deal and you're very lucky. But  you were already told that awhile ago. I feel like they should have given you a heads up this year that that was going to be your present. Then you may have felt less disappointed. I understand where you're coming from, but try to focus on the positives that when you graduate you will be free from debt!", "NTA. They haven\u2019t paid a dime yet, right? There is no excuse for them not getting their daughter any presents. I suspect your dad is the one pushing that.", "NTA. Watercolor paint is not even expensive compared to a PS5, but the way you said it might be hurtful. Your brother is 13, you(probably) got a present when you were 13 so it\u2019s the same thing. You should definitely apologize.", "NTA. this is exactly what happened with me this year for christmas, except my older sister who\u2019s university my parents are already paying for got gifts and i did not. it sucks, and you\u2019re allowed to be disappointed. i hope you still find a way to have a great holiday season op :)", "NTA. A watercolor paint set isn\u2019t that expensive especially compared to a PS5. The point of gift giving is making someone happy. The point of tuition is bettering one\u2019s life in the long run. I can\u2019t understand parents who keep a tally of everything they do or pay for their children; why have children if you\u2019re keeping score like this? Why have children if you don\u2019t want their life to be better? I\u2019m sorry your parents are assholes. Use this tuition to get as far away from them as you can.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know a single parent that wouldn't be thrilled to keep alive the tradition of giving gifts at Christmas time to their children. While it is very clear the majority of their spending budget for presents went toward your little brother, if they left a budget for each of them to get gifts too, and you brought gifts for everyone there, then you were the only one who was excluded for the first time in a family holiday tradition of opening presents, and you're right to feel hurt by that. Granted, helping with your tuition instead of trapping you as a young adult with student loans is a huge gift, it doesn't mean they can't afford a five dollar pair of holiday socks? A matching set of comfort wear for winter? Something nice for your dorm room? A framed picture of the most fun vacation you all had in your entire life? Nothing? Mom and dad just got to you and decided \"let's not?\"\n\nThat hurts. A lot. Especially if they didn't warn you ahead of time that they weren't going to be able to do anything at all for you and that for as long as you go to college, you won't have Christmas gifts? \n\nAt least you know now, but if you apologize, just tell them you were caught up in a moment of feeling like you were too grown up to open presents and you felt jealous that your brother still gets a few good years left of being a kid on Christmas before that disappears and that you didn't mean to make them part of your existential awareness of you reaching that point with Christmas.", "NTA, I'm sorry you didn't get the watercolor paint set you wanted... that's a lot more inexpensive than a PS5.", "NTA. My parents paid my tuition. I still got birthday and Christmas presents. They didn't have to get you anything extravagant AND they aren't paying the tuition this year as you haven't started university. \n\nI'm also a parent to adult children and helped them with school expenses. This was never used as Christmas or Birthday present.", "NTA As a parent to a 17 year old heading off to college, who also had a much smaller than normal Christmas, I\u2019m disappointed in your parents going to the dollar store and buying you a water color set. You should let go of your resentment towards your brother unless this year\u2019s gift was way more extravagant than normal holiday gifts.", "NTA. If they truly could not have afforded to get you a single gift, they should have discussed this with you beforehand to prepare you. PS5's are expensive and your brother got multiple items, it wouldn't have been hard to give you a few small items.", "You're a kid", "NTA. Rub this happening in their face when the time to pay for your brother tuition arrives.", "Eh, ESH. I understand that everyone\u2019s feelings here are a little complicated. You do suck for arguing with your parents about it when they\u2019re giving you a truly indispensable gift of paying for your college education. That\u2019s a HUGE amount of money and a massive sacrifice for you to not deal with debt for the rest of your life. However, I understand feeling a little weird for not having a \u201creal\u201d present to open on Christmas Day. Your mom could have gotten you something small to go along with the college thing, like perhaps a small paint set or a few paint colors/brushes. Even a very small gift would have been a nice gesture just so you\u2019d have something under the tree to open along with your brother. It\u2019s fair of you to be a little miffed, but I think you really need to get over it because your parents overall are doing something amazing for you and you should let gratefulness lead your relationship with them.", "NTA.  That isn't something you surprise someone with in front of people.\n\nIf they wanted you not to express any disappointment at all, they should have had a short, gentle conversation beforehand.", "NTA.

I'm sorry your parents suck OP.", "NTA for sure. I mean, it's cool that your parents are going to pay your tuition... but, I mean, they're your parents. I feel like, if you bring a kid into this world, it's your responsibility to do all you can to help them advance their position in life - and part of that is helping them attend uni.\n\nI mean, I know this can be a lot of money, but it just seems very nickel and dimey to say that this is your present. They could have easily gotten you something smaller. If a college education costs tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars, what on earth difference does it make to throw out a 50 dollar christmas present on top?", "Nta at all! I feel so sorry for you. My oldest son wanted money for Christmas so that's what he got as his main present, but he got boxers and a Christmas tree (empty pot shaped like a tree) with little treats so he'd still have *something* to open along with his brothers. \n\nPersonally I don't think paying for your schooling should be a holiday/birthday etc gift anyway... its a bit tacky...", "nta.  We agreed this year not to exchange presents.  But, we still get our traditional socks.  No way would I give one child a present and not the other.  Even if it's socks and a 50 dollar gift card.  My in-laws paid for all 3 kids to go to college.  And they still got gifts.", "NTA. That would have been a fine graduation gift, but Christmas? Christmas gifts are supposed to be fun, especially when you\u2019re still a kid.", "NTA at all. I get it. They should have discussed this with you before Christmas if they were going to do this. It should not have been a surprise on the day of. A bracelet or earrings or something would have been nice. That being said, you are so fortunate to have parents paying for your university. Take a moment and feel the blessing.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t pay your tuition yet. They very easily could have given you that and a few little gifts. So is this your Christmas present from now on? By there logic this will be your gift for the next several years. Merry Christmas we\u2019re still paying your tuition.", "NTA. My daughter is going to college next year and we have promised to help her but she still gets Christmas presents my us. I\u2019m curious if this is going to be your \u201cpresent\u201d for the next 4 years. Each Christmas you get another year of tuition.", "NTA. Them saying that is weird and power trippy.", ">Posted byu/TimelyIncident82405 hours ago  \n>  \n>62\n\nI agree with NTA. The not getting a gift thing could had been talked about before Christmas. This is one of the reasons the holiday sucks, people always have hurt feelings for one reason or another. Your raised up expecting to get gifts and not expected to give, then expected to give with ever changing expectations, it's awkward and sucks. \n\nMy family does it different and I'm glad my wife agrees. We don't give gifts to each other, my wife and I that is. The kids got gifts from Santa while they believed and small gifts from us. Both their birthdays fall right after Christmas, and starting very young they got so many gifts for both they never used them all and the got gifts just for the sake of getting something, so we has a conversation with them. Would you prefer to keep getting gifts or would you rather we didn't get you anything for your birthday and or Christmas and you could get gifts through out the year? They both thought about it and decided on gifts through out the year. We get them a few small things they want or need, and let them either combine their birthday and Christmas present for one expensive gift, or separate them into several smaller gifts that our financially equivalent. Might not be the best way, but it takes the focus off just buying for the sake of buying. They make or buy presents for others, almost 50/50 at this point, with this year my daughter made and bought everyone a gift. Point is, expectations are awkward and should be addressed before hand to avoid situations like these.", "I'm 33 with Asperger's and I have a hard time controlling my feelings.", "But at the same time a PS5 compared to university fees is literally nothing, depending on where OP lives the cost of the PS5 would be literally 5 weeks of just accommodation alone not including tuition", "It's not a \"gift\" if parents choose to take on that responsibility.", "I immediately thought this. They could even take it past graduation. It's not fair.", "Being 120k in debt from college\u2026I\u2019d take my tuition paid over me Christmas gifts anyway. In my lifetime I doubt my parents would spend 120k on Christmas gifts.", "Thank you for this that is kind of how I was feeling about it, but this is really helpful to read. I definitely feel lucky and that I am in a much better position for the future but yes I think that \"caring but not being great at affection\" makes sense. I think I will apologize and try to better explain that I am really grateful and that I was just used to how Christmas has worked in previous years. I do think my mom might have felt more bad about it than my dad as he can be a bit stoic so I might talk to her first.", "It\u2019s a gift that will change the course of your life. To not have crippling debt in your 20s/ 30s because of college is huge and will set you up for a great life and keep your savings. Sure, they could have got you a present but you can buy yourself a present because you\u2019ll actually have spending money.", "\"My parents gave me the keys to my own house, but I only had one present to open and it was a small box, and now I feel pissed off they didn't get me anything more\"", "Your parents stopped doing gift giving once you and possible siblings hit 18?  My brothers are 25 and 32, my mom still buys them gifts.   Do y'all just stop gift giving tradition once everyone is over 18 then?  I'm sorry if I'm coming off as judgmental or rude, it's not my intent.  I'm just genuinely curious.", "We do something similar..my stepdaughter birthday is a couple of weeks after Christmas. After Christmas with us, Christmas with her mother, Christmas with  her grandma, she needs nothing and wants for nothing on her birthday. We don't get her anything for her birthday, we take her to dinner, then she gets to have a 1/2 birthday party in the summer. She knows not to expect gifts from us on her birthday, she gets birthday from us in the Summer. It works great for us..she gets gifts at different times", "and?", "She's not even IN college yet, jeez.", "Agreed but at 17 she has zero concept of how money works and most teens have not taken any financial literacy classes. While College tuition and expenses far outweigh the cost of her siblings gift I can understand her disappointment. I can also understand a 17 year old being a little envious. \n\nWithout knowing OP\u2019s parents financial situation it may have been nice to include a \u2018college gift\u2019 in the box, bed linens and a blanket for the dorm. Something small but also related to the new chapter she is about to embark on.", "What does this even mean?  So if I go to a birthday party and I buy the birthday boy/girl a game for whatever console they have, is that not a \"gift\" since I chose to on the resonsability of buying the game?", "Why isn't it fair to spend more on tuition and skip buying superficial gifts? Who is it unfair to? The little brother that isn't in college yet?", "Part of it is about living in the moment too. A couple of gifts under $50 isn\u2019t going to break anyone that can afford to pay for tuition. Who says she\u2019ll even finish college?", "I have two kids in college, we pay some but not all of their expenses so it\u2019s not quite the same situation, but it never occurred to me to use that as their Christmas gift. I can see it if your parents very recently paid the bill and it made money tight for Christmas, but even then I would have said something to you in advance. And I would have found some less expensive items that would have been nice to open. How much even is a watercolor set? It can\u2019t be that expensive. \n\nMy partner got a combo birthday/Christmas gift earlier this month that cost $1k, which is HUGE for us. Our usual budget is around $100/each. But we still got them a few small gifts to open on Christmas.", "I'm assuming because they said university they live in the UK where you fund tuition with a loan from the government which you only start paying back when you start meeting the threshold for annual salary and even then it's small amounts and once you reach a certain age the debt is written off. They would actually be better off saving the money for a deposit on a house.", "In my family gifts are for children. So yes we stop exchanging gifts with adults once we turn 18. That's not say that when I was in college my grandparents never slipped me a $20 bill when I was home on Christmas break to help me out but it was never expected. We do a lot for each other throughout the year. Helping at each others houses, treating the family to nice dinners, etc. We focus our holiday celebrations on just spending time together, enjoying a nice meal together and spoiling the children.", "They\u2019re saying that all humans are bound to react poorly to their emotions occasionally, no matter how old we get", "I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s bs, a 17 year old know how how money works for gods sake they aren\u2019t a toddler", "I believe they meant the responsibility of the tuition. I am a parent of a college age kid and pay their tuition, it\u2019s my decision to take that responsibility and that\u2019s not a Christmas present. It\u2019s a budgetary concern and a reason to scale back the scope of gifts but not a reason to at least not get a watercolor set or small gift for under the tree.", ">What does this even mean?", "Interesting and that's good your family is supportive with each other :)", "Yep.", "No she is not a toddler BUT I cannot make the assumption that her parents have taught her about money. Nor can I make the assumption that she has a job now and is saving money to cover some of her personal expenses at College. I can only assume that she is 17 and was disappointed. She is 17 and presumably her parents are paying all of her current living expenses."]}
