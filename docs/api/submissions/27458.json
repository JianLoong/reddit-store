{"id": 27458, "submission_id": "16q1bih", "title": "AITA for cancelling my parents invitation to go on a 5* holiday with us?", "selftext": "So, we were planning and talking about this trip for a full year and we were all excited to be going together, in part going on holiday and in part an extension of our wedding anniversary celebrations which were before this trip. Their preference was always to go together with us rather than by themselves, which we also offered and discussed.\n\n1. We wanted to treat my(30f) parents (62f +59m) to a special, 5\\* holiday for their big anniversary. We already had a good, tried and tested hotel - it is the same hotel we went to for our honeymoon so we knew it would be perfect, and that especially my mum, would absolutely love it. As my parents live in a different country to us, and would struggle to get around in a foreign country (they don't know english), my husband(30m) made the effort to arrange the flights in a way that would mean we would arrive on the same day and also at similar times of the day to make it as easy as possible for my parents, even though we would have to drive 3h to the airport in our country - it was never an issue but is a reminder that all the effort put into making this trip was basically futile.\n2. Long story short, my mum is mad at me (for something that is ridiculous, but I still apologised for - details in comments) and relations between my mum and my dad are also strained to say the least. She wouldn't speak to me or him on their anniversary celebration which we flew to only because my father asked me to come - hoping all will be resolved - that did not happen. Last time she was mad at me, she wouldn't speak to me for a whole year. It is always really risky with her, she is either in good mood or bad mood, and when she is in bad mood she ruins everything for everyone. We (me, my husband and my father) suspect she is either bipolar or has a border personality disorder, but of course she will not go to a psychiatrist. My dad seems to have developed a mild drinking problem which is worrying but I digress.\n3. As we are going together, and it is our only proper holiday this year, I can't let anything destroy it. This is also taking a big toll on my relationship with my husband. How do I know that even if she says that she wants to go on holiday with us, she won't turn around and say that she wants flights back home in a couple of days into holiday, or how do we know she doesn't get mad at me for a little nonsense? I feel like with her, everything is just hanging up in the air by a string, waiting to fall down on us at the flick of her finger.\n\nThe worst thing about this is that we feel like WATAs here because we are the ones who have invited them to come with us but the bad relations between me and my mum, and my father and my mum are absolutely not our fault and we refuse to be dragged into their problems. We tried everything we could to restore good relations with my mum and nothing has worked - she won't speak to me, she hasn't even texted us on our anniversary day.\n\n**AITA for deciding that me and my husband are going to go on holiday without them, given the situation?**", "created_utc": 1695465926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q1bih/aita_for_cancelling_my_parents_invitation_to_go/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should probably speak to your father though and explain your reasons.", "NTA.  But speak to your father before cancelling. Maybe you go with the original plan where they go separately so you can just adjust their dates - they may struggle a bit with English and you won\u2019t be there together but nobody can say you didn\u2019t give them the gift and then resent you for that.", "NTA. And I would not lie, your mother should know that her behavior has cost her this trip. I also would stop trying to reach out. Try to keep a relationship with your father, but give up on your mother. Let her come to you if she wants a relationship, right now you are playing into her tantrum, walk away from it.", "**Background to why my mum is mad at me:**\n\n**1.** Two months before the holiday, my dad was visiting us - my dad has been helping us to finish renovating our house - as he is self-employed and we didn't want him to lose out on income, so we paid him for helping us. My mum also decided to come with him for the 10 days, even though usually she stayed at home and preferred visiting for weekends. Apart from renovating the house, we also wanted to spend some leisure time together so we arranged to go shopping with my mum, go on a trip at the weekend and have a good time, not just work and we communicated this to my parents.\n\n\\-\n\n**2.** When they arrived we knew something was off, and that they must have got into a fight - unfortunately this is a very frequent situation of my mother completely ignoring my father or being mad at him. She wouldn't acknowledge him, but as the days went by the mood got lighter and lighter, we spent nice evenings laughing, talking and cooking. During the day we were renovating the house, so me and my husband were running errands to get things for the house.\n\n\\-\n\n**3.** So one day we went to get tiles for the bathroom and when we came back my mum was in a good mood, asking: shall we make coffee? - this was a daily routine for us to drink coffee together. As we came out of the car we noticed she had been on her knees, scrapping weeds of the paving blocks on our driveway, cleaning windows etc. - she didn't have any work clothes so she was doing it in joggers and a vest top. So I said something along the lines of, \"wow you shouldn't be doing this, it should be me doing this not you. I feel ashamed in front of my neighbours for you to be doing this work, when I should be doing this\" (the street can see everything happening in front of our house).\n\nThen she just stormed off, not saying a word. She didn't want to drink coffee anymore and was upset despite me instantly going after her and apologising for my words. My husband also went to say to her that we really appreciate her helping us around the house and that we didn't mean to upset her and we are sorry if we caused her upset. He also told her the day before not to do the weed scrapping as he will deal with it and that he feels bad to see her do it - she didn't seem to be upset then.\n\n\\-\n\n**4.** So now she was mad and upset, she wouldn't leave her room, I brought her coffee, breakfast, dinner and supper each day for next 2-3 days and was apologising and saying sorry but this didn't do anything. Then she deteriorated and wanted my dad to buy her a flight back on the same/next day which cost a fortune - he bought her the flight, my husband drove her to the airport and that was it.\n\n\\-\n\n**5.** Then, couple of weeks after, my father begged us to come to their anniversary, which we did, even though my mum texted she doesn't have any contact with me. We bought my mum flowers, and then we bought a giant bouquet for their anniversary - but my mum wouldn't still speak to us. The anniversary was a disaster as well as she wouldn't speak to my dad during the whole thing. We then flew back home and couple weeks after she wouldn't even write a simple text to us on our anniversary.\n\n\\-\n\n**6.** So my mum will not call, text or speak to us. My dad seems to have my mum talking to him again but we are not there so we don't know what the situation is - he also is afraid to speak to me in fear of her finding out and being mad at him for that. Apparently she is telling everyone around her that they are going on holiday - even though we have all their flight and hotel details and she hasn't spoken to me for two months. She also was mad at me for letting her go to the airport, when it was herself that requested a ticket be bought for her to return home early.\n\n\\-\n\n**7. TLDR:** I feel like my mum has been messing with my head my whole life, in the past I already had to run from my parents home and move out as living with her was unbearable. It's absolutely exhausting just going on in circles. She can either be loving, kind and the perfect mum or just mad, shouting and making you her worst enemy.", "NTA\nMaybe think about you and your husband's needs and healthy boundaries. Rather than frame rethinking the vacation as a punishment for mom's behavior, frame it around what mutual boundaries you and your spouse need to maintain to protect your safety, privacy and comfort individually within your marriage, and mutually around your marriage. Notice when you feel uncomfortable. That's probably a situation where stronger boundaries are needed.\n\nYou can't express any objection to mom's behavior because, rather than communicating as adults with unique perspectives, she treats it as an attack and responds with pouts, stonewalling, demanding changes to plans to the inconvenience of everyone else. Your boundary? Something like \"We need to be able to communicate and cooperate without being treated like our input is unwelcome.\"\n\nShe (mom) seems to be \"on the outs\" with her husband- and others- fairly regularly. A vacation centered on mollifyng mom, who is resentful of everyone else on the trip, seems like an expensive way to be trying to meet her unnamed and/or shifting expectations while you are far away from your usual supports and resources. A boundary? \"We aren't comfortable planning a vacation where everyone isn't on good terms.\"\n\nIt seems like mom uses anger to punish those around her. She resents communication that isn't what she wants to hear. She pouts, holds grudges, and demands apologies for her having to hear your \"wrong\" and invalid perspectives, feelings and goals.\n\nShe sounds exhausting. Maybe planning to vacation with her has always been a bad idea. What reason do you have to expect her behavior on the vacation won't be the same obstructive angry \"fix my feelings\" behavior she consistently demonstrates?", "If I understand this is a long pattern with your mum - big emotion swings. The current one has gone on for at least weeks?\n\nNTA - don\u2019t go on an expensive long trip (especially where you\u2019re paying for everyone) - talk to the dad and explain - he lives with it every day and will understand.  \n\nThen - wait and see how this plays out - she\u2019ll be mad but shes already mad so there\u2019s nothing you can do at this point.", "NTA of course.

You are still trying to bend yourself backwards to make her happy. This isn\u2019t a way to live. If y\u2019all decide to have kids, will you allow her to do this to them? You need to learn that you are allowed to have your own happiness without worrying about hers", "NTA \n\nAnd you should give your mom the 5* NC treatment", "Thanks, yes I have spoken with him. He thinks that saying to my mum we are cancelling due to my husbands poor health would be best option, and that me and my husband should still go. Though I am uncomfortable with lying and would rather say that we are cancelling due to my mums behaviour.", "Thanks, adjusting the dates is quite difficult as we bought the hotel and flights for them separately to make the flight times work for them and us but I will look into that. We could always cancel, lose flight money and rebook them for another date I guess.", "Thanks for your perspective. This is how I feel deep down too, I cannot keep playing into her tantrum all the time and allow myself to be dragged into this. I need space to breathe and make sure that I am not losing my sanity over all of this.", "Thank you for your perspective and extensive input, I appreciate you. I agree with your points and I do need to start setting boundaries and be clear about them, rather than getting into pointless arguments and disagreements. Maybe it was a bad idea all along, maybe I was delusional thinking that good relations will continue.\n\nI just wish it didn't have to end with 'us' doing something that she will use against us. I can already see it how she will be saying what a disgusting daughter I am for cancelling the holiday.", "Thanks for your perspective. The current one has lasted two months now so over 8 weeks.\n\nThe thing is, because my dad is pretending that he doesn't talk to me so not to cause upset between him and her, he insists on myself reaching out to my mum to tell her that the holiday is cancelled. I'd rather for my dad to tell my mum they are not going, since she doesn't want anything to do with me.\n\nOn another hand, how could she expect to be going on holiday with us if she hasn't spoken to me for 8 weeks.", "I have contact with my father, spoke with him.  I don't have contact with my mother. My mother doesn't speak to me or text me. My father thinks we could get away with saying to my mother that we are cancelling the trip altogether due to my husbands poor health, but we would still go obviously - though I don't like this option.\n\nI would rather have my mother know that I am upset over the whole situation and that she would come to me to apologise for the whole ordeal - realistically this is never going to happen, my mother never apologised for anything in her life.", "Yes, that is a possibility. He unfortunately sometimes is quick to switch sides in conflict, I don't blame him, since he is the one that still has to live with my mother, while I live abroad. As I put in a comment above, my father thinks we could get away with saying to my mother that we are cancelling the trip altogether due to my husbands poor health, but we would still go obviously - though I don't like this option. My father also believes that the reason for my mother being mad at me is completely ridiculous and it's a non-issue, she shouldn't be still mad at us, especially as we have apologised for whatever offence we could have caused.", "Since your dad tells to switch sides to appear your mom, I think sooner or later he's going to give her the reason, and being caught in the lie will be worse than telling the truth from the start.\n\nEnjoy your vacation! And he glad that you won't be walking on eggshells.", "I suspect that in the long term his approach might be better, yours being more likely to lead to an irreparable breach with your mother.\n\nthat said i do understand your reluctance to lie", "I agree with your dad, his approach of lying will be better for you and everyone else in the long term.", "I mean, I think whatever you do is fine. Probably more important to discuss it with your father and see what he thinks, so that it\u2019s more of a joint decision than a unilateral one where you inform him what you did. That matters a lot and can go a long way to making sure your father doesn\u2019t resent you.  If he knows you may rebook for them separately later, that might help too. \n\nSorry you\u2019re going through this.  Parents and their anger is deeply distressful.", "So any reasonable person wouldn\u2019t expect to - however she may see it as you\u2019ve slighted her in some way (clearly you haven\u2019t). \n\nConsider sending a card by mail wishing them well and letting them know you\u2019ll miss them while you\u2019re away.", "I don't understand how this answers what I asked.

I took it as it was a very long term issue.", "You are partly right, and sorry if I'm not being clear.\n\nThe long term issue here is being on an ON/OFF relationship with my mum. She is either mad at me and won't speak to me or is the perfect mum. This has so far happened 3 times in my life. This is the 3rd time.\n\nThe 2nd time she was mad at me, she would not speak to me for the full year. It took hours of me calling her and reaching out to get back to some kind of normality with her.

I really don't have time for this and feel that I need to focus on my own marriage because this situation is taking a toll on it.", "NTA, but please stop enabling these ludicrous tantrums from an adult.  I understand that your father trained you to put up with her insanity and enable it, but now that your an adult you must stop.

But you can change the way you deal with her. Look out for you and your husband and your mental health.", "I think you should just ask your dad to come.", "NTA, but if your mom is so mad about a frivolous thing, it\u2019s unlikely she will speak to you ever again if you tell her it\u2019s about her behavior. Your dad is likely right. She doesn\u2019t need to know the real reason. But you absolutely shouldn\u2019t try to take her anywhere.", "I can see why you would want to cancel this holiday, but could you consider all going together as per your original plan?  You, your husband and your dad could have a wonderful holiday together and your mum could just sit in her room and sulk.  That's on her.  I think ignoring her tantrums, thus letting her know they don't work, could be a way of dealing with her.", "NTA - your mother has a rigid personality and she holds a grudge.  The only thing you can do with grudge holders is to let them be.  Eventually they will get over the grudge.\n\nYour dad tried to fix the problem by telling you to come visit.  But your mother told you not to and she was the one holding the grudge.  So the right answer would have been, sorry dad, but mom is still holding a grudge and this isn\u2019t going to end well until she is done holding the grudge and she reestablishes contact.\n\nYour dad is probably drinking because after years of dealing with his wife\u2019s behavior and the consequences of her behavior, he is losing his patience and drinking to cope.  Your dad can\u2019t fix your mother.\n\nNo amount of apologies can get your mother to drop her grudge.  So you need to stop apologizing when she has a hissy fit and let her go into her cave.  Stop poking the bear in the cave, it doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nSo, regarding the trip, you should be honest with her.  Because she is currently holding a grudge and not speaking to you, you are canceling the trip (just cancel her and your dad\u2019s tickets).  That you don\u2019t want to offend or bother her, so the trip is cancelled.  Say nothing more.  Cancel their tickets and then enjoy the vacation with your husband.  She may extend her grudge because you were honest, there is no way to know.  But lying to her isn\u2019t going to help or shorten her grudge.\n\nGoing forward, you need to decide how and when you are going to interact with her.  Obviously telling her to not do something she was doing (pulling weeds) was enough for her to flip out and hold a grudge.  So, you need to let her do whatever she is doing because if you suggest she not do it or do something else, she will have a fit and hold a grudge because she doesn\u2019t want anyone telling her what to do or suggesting what she should do, and her only mechanism for responding to it is to hold a grudge for weeks/months.  These are not normal behaviors, but at this point she will never go to therapy because she doesn\u2019t think she is doing anything wrong.\n\nDo not schedule anymore trips for them.  Part of her grudge thing could be that you wanted to treat her to a trip she didn\u2019t want to go on and he looked for a convenient other issue to hold a grudge so that you would cancel a trip that she didn\u2019t want and she wouldn\u2019t have to go.", "She's not speaking to you?

I wouldn't want my vacation ruined by having to tip-toe around her volatile emotions.", "Not diagnosing but I think you are on track with Borderline Personality Disorder.

She sounds absolutely exhausting and seems to be exactly where she wants to be: in complete control of how everyone behaves around her, and then have them tripping over themselves to apologize and beg her forgiveness whenever she wants the attention.\n\nIs that really the relationship you want with her? How do you think you could change your behaviour to keep yourself psychologically safer? You can\u2019t change her, but you can change you.\n\nWhen my toddlers threw tantrums, I ignored them. They might get one serious, \u201cThis behaviour is not ok.\u201d but that was it.

The tantrums are the fucking worst.", "The problem here is everybody caters to her. She knows everyone will walk behind her begging to be forgiven for whatever bug she has up her ass. She's not happy until enough begging has been done. Just stop. One apology, period. If she's still mad, let her stew in her own juices. Take dad on vacation, leave the drama queen at home.", "Thanks, it's difficult to cut her off because it is my mother after all. The worst thing is that at times she can be a good and caring mother.

But we are 100% confident that if she just notices us having a good time or has a slightest hint of us having fun, she will absolutely go out of her way to cause drama, argue and behave like a total crazy person - it won't matter to her that she is in a 5 star hotel and there are other people around.\n\nJust the thought of this makes me sick, plus she could ruin our honeymoon hotel for us too, which we hope to return to in the future - so it feels like there is too much at stake here to just 'ride it out'.\n\nWe also feel that we have 'rode out' a lot of stuff already, like their anniversary for example, where she didn't even look at us and deliberately avoided speaking to us in front of others - at least my brother and his wife understood what was happening and talked with us - and also previous times that we stayed at my parents when she was super mad, and we were tip toeing around the house not to cause any issues for her.", "Tell your mom her behavior sucks and once again ruined a special thing. Don\u2019t lie", "Thank you for the recommendation, I will definitely look into it.", "But see? You have internalized the responsibility for her moods. She can say whatever she wants about you cancelling the holiday - you aren\u2019t responsible for that. If you want, you can reply how disgusting it was that her behaviour made you cancel the holiday.\n\nYou are responsible for your safety - and maybe your husband\u2019s, a little. Not your mother\u2019s. She\u2019ll learn once she realizes that she can\u2019t bully you any more.", "I disagree. The only way to achieve some degree of peace with people like this is to set firm boundaries. If mom wants a 5 star vacation, she needs to behave properly. If she doesn\u2019t, OP needs to be ready to cut contact for a pre-determined amount of time and stick to it. Clear and firm positive and negative incentives is the only thing that will work although it takes patience because she will first try to test your resolve", "Have you thought about just inviting your dad? It sounds like he might need a break from your mom", "I sort of see what the other person is saying here. I have difficult people in my family too. If you want to have a relationship with difficult people you have to understand that they are going to continue being difficult people no matter what you do. You can't really hold onto hope that difficult people will turn into reasonable person just because you did something that was special and expensive and a lot of work. You have to protect yourself from that. Please know that I'm not trying to blame the victim here.

She is incapable of being that person. My grandmother was a manipulative creature just like this , and it broke my heart to see my mom slice herself into ribbons to try to gain her love.

Stay away from her as much as possible!!!!", "Oh, the SllentTreatment^(TM). Such a nice thing. Of course she expects to go on a nice 10\\*Vacation with you, because, in her mind, she's just showing you that she has a right to her precious feelings. (You have no right to that, by the way. Believe me.)\n\nMy mother is like that. The last time we went on a shared vacation for my father's 70th birthday (to our favorite Island, for hiking) I got the SilentTreatment^(TM) on day 4 for... I don't even know. I was well into my 40s. Her sister, my very much loved aunt, told me, oh, let's not spoil our vacation over that, and so we did, and it was the last time that SilentTreatment^(TM) worked. She never tried that weapon again.\n\nThat being said: Yeah. You don't want that. Tell them that the invitation kind of... is obsolete. You could tell your father it's because she's not even talking to you, but that won't help if he's the enabler I suspect him to be.", "Cancel the holiday but GIVE NO REASON. Any reason you give her will turn into ammunition in her hands. Go low-contact, but don't announce it. And of course, get to therapy ASAP.\n\nThere's no way to avoid having your mother be angry. But there are ways to avoid giving her power to punish you.", "Your mom is jealous of your life and relationship with your father.   She is insufferable and will never be satisfied.", "I doubt her mom has any real friends.", "My thoughts exactly.  Her mother would flip the F out and her dad's life would be a living hell when he returns.  He would be able to rest while he is away though.", "Why lie??  Just say due to strained relationships, it would be best not to take a family holiday and leave it at that.  No argument, no debating.   You were paying for the trip, you are done.", "Why save her feelings and lie about cancelling?\n\nJust tell her that with her current behaviour towards you you can't see yourself going on vacation with her.\n\nNTA", "\u201cDon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d just enables your mother to continue this behavior.", "Lie lie lie. And have a wonderful holiday!!!!", "My sister has BPD and it read like her to a T. When we were teens she told me she doesn't feel loved unless she's fighting with someone and it made me want to get jettisoned into space. She's done nothing but get worse and I'm glad I finally put my foot down and went NC.", ">I can already see it how she will be saying what a disgusting daughter I am for cancelling the holiday.\n\nINFO: I am honestly stumped why you would give a flying fuck what your mother thinks, says, or does. Go full NC with the both of them. I know you still want to maintain a relationship with your dad, but think about it, he is not innocent here. He has enabled her behavior for decades. now he wants you to lie about why the trip is cancelled, no doubt to keep the peace, which he has been doing for years to no positive effect.\n\nNTA", "Thanks, yes, thought about it but think it would probably make the situation worse between them. We don't want to be in the middle of that."]}
