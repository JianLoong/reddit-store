I do all the cleaning, I prefer to, bc well, he is a man. No offense to the males but his idea of clean is far from my idea of what's clean.\n\nWe are hosting a X-mas party for my family. My first time ever being able to, and I am very excited! I went out and bought Xmas slippers in all different styles and sizes. My partner asked why we had a huge basket of slippers by the door and i told him. I plan on telling everyone that they have to remove their shoes before entering the house, but I have slippers for everyone and they are welcome to bring them home after the party. My partner is saying I am being an Ahole bc I shouldn't expect people to feel comfortable taking their shoes off. I asked my sister what she thought, and she said I am being weird. That some people choose shoes to go with their outfit, or just don't want to take them off. That I should just get over it and let them wear what they want. \n\nI don't allow shoes in the house normally. I have 2 cats that will eat whatever is on the floor. From dirt, to fur, to leaves that blow in. And I also, just hate the thought of shit being ground into my floors. I am giving out slippers, am I really an ahole for expecting the rules of our home be followed?\n\nEDIT:: the me cleaning bc I do it better, is an ongoing joke/silly argument I have with my partner. I am truly sorry if I offended anyone with this comment. I won't delete it, but I should have just pointed out that I alone am the one who always cleans. Until he moved in with me, he never had to clean a day in his life. He does help, but I always end up redoing whatever he did.

It was so natural for me that I didn't even realize what they were amused about until I had been there for several months. \n\nSo I vote NAH-- there's no harm in asking people to do this for you, and you're providing the fun slippers. But Your partner isn't really being unreasonable if this isn't something you normally do in your culture. \n\nI would definitely give your guests the heads-up about the no-shoes request well in advance of the party. They might prefer to bring their own slippers or indoor-only shoes to go with their outfits or something like that.", "NTA but I would get some slipper socks, the fluffy socks with the grippy stuff on the bottom, as an option as well. Especially if someone has very wide, very large or even very small feet those may be more comfortable for them. I'd be so happy if I got to take home new holiday socks or slippers from a party. I would include this as an asterisk note on your party invitations though so everyone knows. That way no surprises or arguments. And you might have to make an exception if someone has a legit medical issue. Right now I have walking casts on both legs that I cannot remove and walk. Other people have special orthotic shoes or inserts they must wear. So maybe get a box of shoe covers as well?

You're nice to think of providing slippers that they can take home.", "NTA. In additon to slippers you might want to get some covers people can put over their shoes (contractors use these as do many medical professionals), that way if people really don't want to or for some reason can't take off their shoes they could still be prevented from tracking stuff into and around your home.

I get cold feet easily, so I'd really appreciate that.", "The only caution I would make, is if you have someone who has orthotics in their shoes for physical reasons, putting them into flat slippers can absolutely ruin any evening.

It really is amazing the amount of outside dirt that gets tracked into your home.

In the winter, shoes, or more accurately boots, don\u2019t leave the foyer and if I forget something I either don\u2019t bring it with me or it\u2019s an extra 5 minutes taking shoes off and putting them back on. \n\nNTA", "Americans are savages, who wears shoes inside someones home ever??", "NTA about the shoes.

When I first had to do it I hated it. It was unexpected and my socks with holes were embarrassing. I was also honestly worried that my feet or shoes smelled or something. Over the course of the year I got used to it and once I was prepared it was fine, but it is not something that i embraced it.\n\nNow, over a decade later we also just bought a house, and while we had slowly been embracing no shows indoors ourselves for a few years, this is the first time that we are actually asking others to do the same.

I told them weeks in advance. My mom said \"for me she'd go through anything\" basically making it out to be some kind of torture she was willing to endure for me. My dad said he'd step foot ONCE in the house, without shoes, to see it for the first time but that he'd refuse to come in again.
