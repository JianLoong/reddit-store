I do all the cleaning, I prefer to, bc well, he is a man. No offense to the males but his idea of clean is far from my idea of what's clean.\n\nWe are hosting a X-mas party for my family. My first time ever being able to, and I am very excited! I went out and bought Xmas slippers in all different styles and sizes. My partner asked why we had a huge basket of slippers by the door and i told him. I plan on telling everyone that they have to remove their shoes before entering the house, but I have slippers for everyone and they are welcome to bring them home after the party. My partner is saying I am being an Ahole bc I shouldn't expect people to feel comfortable taking their shoes off. I asked my sister what she thought, and she said I am being weird. That some people choose shoes to go with their outfit, or just don't want to take them off. That I should just get over it and let them wear what they want. \n\nI don't allow shoes in the house normally. I have 2 cats that will eat whatever is on the floor. From dirt, to fur, to leaves that blow in. And I also, just hate the thought of shit being ground into my floors. I am giving out slippers, am I really an ahole for expecting the rules of our home be followed?\n\nEDIT:: the me cleaning bc I do it better, is an ongoing joke/silly argument I have with my partner. I am truly sorry if I offended anyone with this comment. I won't delete it, but I should have just pointed out that I alone am the one who always cleans. Until he moved in with me, he never had to clean a day in his life. He does help, but I always end up redoing whatever he did.

It was so natural for me that I didn't even realize what they were amused about until I had been there for several months. \n\nSo I vote NAH-- there's no harm in asking people to do this for you, and you're providing the fun slippers. But Your partner isn't really being unreasonable if this isn't something you normally do in your culture. \n\nI would definitely give your guests the heads-up about the no-shoes request well in advance of the party. They might prefer to bring their own slippers or indoor-only shoes to go with their outfits or something like that.", "NTA but I would get some slipper socks, the fluffy socks with the grippy stuff on the bottom, as an option as well. Especially if someone has very wide, very large or even very small feet those may be more comfortable for them. I'd be so happy if I got to take home new holiday socks or slippers from a party. I would include this as an asterisk note on your party invitations though so everyone knows. That way no surprises or arguments. And you might have to make an exception if someone has a legit medical issue. Right now I have walking casts on both legs that I cannot remove and walk. Other people have special orthotic shoes or inserts they must wear. So maybe get a box of shoe covers as well?

You're nice to think of providing slippers that they can take home.", "NTA. In additon to slippers you might want to get some covers people can put over their shoes (contractors use these as do many medical professionals), that way if people really don't want to or for some reason can't take off their shoes they could still be prevented from tracking stuff into and around your home.

I get cold feet easily, so I'd really appreciate that.", "The only caution I would make, is if you have someone who has orthotics in their shoes for physical reasons, putting them into flat slippers can absolutely ruin any evening.

It really is amazing the amount of outside dirt that gets tracked into your home.

Yeah, feet can be dirty too but it's not even in the same ballpark.\n\nThe person who cleans the house has everything right to demand no outside shoes in the house.", "If you disinvite yourself from a party due to not wanting to take your shoes off indoors you are the weird one not the host", "Cause it's really not a big deal any which way as a guest.

So to not wear shoes as a guest in someone else\u2019s home would make me feel undressed. And people where I live have never worried about the dirt and bacteria. I\u2019ve never seen anyones carpet or floor get dirty because they had guests over. And you just clean it anyway.

It would be seen as making yourself too at home, 'acting like you own the place', generally unmannerly. Worth noting that it rains year round there, and the norm is to receive guests in your kitchen for tea. Some people even have armchairs in their kitchens for this. Guests know to stay out of carpeted rooms, lest you get a lecture about the good carpets and how easy they are to ruin/contaminate. \n\nI think it's an adaptation to the weather. Rain and mud are going to get tracked in as a foregone conclusion no matter the time of year, so houses with easily swept and mopped 'receiving' areas with a heavy door mat to wipe detritus and muck off are the norm, and no one wants guests walking around in wet socks. The inner carpeted areas are for personal comfort, so if someone's made it that far they're either family or a very very close friend, and the invitation to remove and removal of their shoes is an acknowledgement of that closeness.\n\nThis could have changed in Ireland since I was growing up, I've lived in Canada now for close to a decade. I still feel weird taking my shoes off going into some homes, but if I forget and someone reminds me, they come off no questions asked.\n\nIt is slightly hard not to get annoyed on the rare times when people have followed up that reminder with 'didn't you parents teach you about cleanliness/bacteria/whatever'.

I have had to leave parties early for this reason.

Plenty of the women at my work are the same, they\u2019ll joke with eachother about how useless their partners are.

So before I left for work last night I told him he needs to finish the laundry. We go downstairs and switch it with lightening speed (he put the clean load back in the hamper without folding it) and he hung the stuff and I left. \n\nI come home. The clothes are still in the hamper. I got triggered, literally told him \"uh why are the clothes not folded they're going to get wrinkled\" .. I dump them on the bed prepared to finish and he helps no hesitation. But I told him the point of HELPING is doing it fully. I could've thrown the shit in the hamper. So he got it and we are good on that but like. Men. They really ain't on it like us women. I usually just do it all myself bc I know I do it right and it bothers me when people don't do it the \"right way.\" Maybe that's controlling but what ever \n\n\nI think my point here is that idk, my man is so well meaning but even when he helps with cleaning I'm still like, feeling like i do it better. And sometimes \"jokes\" that put people in a box, are just a way to bring humor to a pattern of human behavior. Maybe women just have something in their brain chemistry that makes us more aware of the micro in cleaning .. where men just see a tidy room and think it's fine. I say this with a father who had a masculine career as a fireman and fire Marshall, but despite that is the best cook and can deep clean very well.
