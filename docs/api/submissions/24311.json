You don\u2019t get to decide that the person you\u2019re \u201ccomplimenting\u201d takes it as a compliment if they don\u2019t see it that way.  \nOP didn\u2019t cause a big scene about it though, just clapped back with a zinger of her own that Josh thought was funny. But she\u2019s an AH in your eyes. \nWhy?  \nShe told Josh that she wouldn\u2019t look at him twice\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean that she thinks he\u2019s ugly, as people are claiming, or that somehow she insulted Casey. Just that she wouldn\u2019t date him. Him making a bold claim of \u201cI picked the wrong girl\u201d being met with \u201cI was never available for you to pick\u201d is a great comeback. It\u2019s the age old \u201cin your dreams\u201d comeback. It\u2019s not necessarily an attack on his looks, or a dig at Casey for dating him.  \nIt\u2019s much more likely to be due to his behaviour, for obvious reasons I hope.  \nBut Josh? He could have just wolf whistled and said she looked hot. Would have been weird in my book, but depends on their friendship dynamics, it\u2019s true.  \nBut he didn\u2019t. He specifically targeted his gf. Basically \u201cyou\u2019re hotter than my gf\u201d in front of everyone. What other way could you interpret \u201cchose the wrong friend\u201d?  \nSo how is OP an AH? For refusing to apologise? For meeting (what OP calls) crass behaviour with a clever but scathing comeback?  \nStrikes me that Casey was understandably upset with the whole situation but feels she can\u2019t go against the bf, likely due to him making demeaning remarks about her which has lowered her self esteem. So she goes for the (perceived) easier target of OP, hoping to guilt her into apologising therefore taking the blame for the drama, so that Casey can go back to pretending that her bf isn\u2019t negging her and everything is fine and dandy.  \nSo why is OP the AH?", "The knowledge is just so poor that it's impossible to do actually coherent analyses", "Or it was a joke?", "Oh I'm not saying OP thinks that way or even meant it that way, I'm just wondering if that's how Casey took it, bc it could be interpreted like that", "I agree- she was inadvertently insulting the friend as well.", "He said he picked the wrong one implying OP was better and all OP said in response was that he wouldn\u2019t have had a shot with her.

He made a joke and you took it very personally.", "ESH, while calling Josh on an inappropriate comment is NTA, what you said is hurtful to Casey about her choice of BF and being lesser than you.", "YTA. He made a comment that was playful banter and a compliment. You completely eviscerated him with a low-blow insult.", "So if someone says something inappropriate, does that give license to others to say inappropriate things as well?", "YTA, understand it was a joke. Yet you let your feelings/ insecurites get in the way", "LMAO you in one comment called both Josh and his girlfriend ugly.\n\nHe's ugly because he couldn't get you and she's ugly because she has him", "ESH: you sorta said that you\u2019re better than your friend, because she picked him.\n\n\u201cI never would have looked twice at you\u201d\nYet your friend is literally dating him.\n\nYeah Josh objectified you, but with your comeback you also dissed your friend.", "You\u2019re not wrong for smacking josh down, but you did embarrass Casey.  You effectively said her boyfriend is too disgusting for you, but perfectly ok for her barnyard or pedestrian tastes.  Get it?", "Casey comes across as the AH here for taking things too personally. Sounds like Josh doesn\u2019t really care about the whole thing and your response, while probably not entirely necessary and rude, doesn\u2019t sound out of the ordinary.", "NTA at all, OP. But I can understand your friend's reaction: your answer to Josh probably sounds to her like, Josh is not enough for you, but he is enough for her. Anyway, she defending him is ridiculous, he offended you *and her* in the first place.", "Casey\u2019s not mad that you called Josh ugly.  She\u2019s mad because you implied that SHE\u2019s ugly.", "ESH. Josh is being inappropriate for saying that, but it was obviously a joke, bad one, of course. You're a weirdo/cringe for commenting back in such a self-righteous and demeaning way.", "ESH.\n\nI think your response was actually offensive to Casey. You essentially acknowledged that you thought you were better than her. At least that's how it came off to me, and I would bet that's how it came off to her.\n\nI love that you called him in his bullshit, but I think you didn't need to insult Casey in your response. Her boyfriend had already done that.\n\nSince Casey seems used to this behavior and he was so bold, I would be concerned that he's saying stuff like this to her behind closed doors. Especially since her priority was defending him and not reacting to his disrespect of her. He could be destroying her sense of self worth to keep her \"obedient\" to him. You should check on your friend.\n\nAnd of course he obviously sucks and I'm glad you put him down.", "ESH, the boyfriend the most\n\nThe only way you are taking this too far is by continuing ti enable him to think this is cute behaviour because clesrly your calling it out does nothing. Why do you hangout with these people they sound awful. I couldn't imagine the kinda guy who'd say something like this is actually a lovely stand up guy if u get to know him.\n\nThis man actively sexualising his girlfriends friends infront of her and calls her effectively ugly in the process. And you at no point comment on that? Are you okay with her being with the kinda guy to say that? It doesn't sound like you are being a very good friend based off of what is written here.\n\nJust separate from these people.", "YTA\n\nJosh was just playing around with the wolf whistle, and as a response you say that he's not good enough for you, implying Casey is inferior.  Casey gets insulted twice now, and you drew a lot of attention to the situation.  Poor Casey.  I think you should apologize to her in private, if there's an opportunity.", "So josh insulted Casey and you insinuated josh settled for Casey. Sad all round really. ETA except Casey.", "I think what you said was great, but I can see her side too.  He was essentially treating you both like meat.  I would leave it alone, but if he says anything like that again maybe add in that he needs to have a bit more respect for his girlfriend and stop ogling other peoples.", "Low enough to be with Josh, that\u2019s how low her self-esteem is.", "Damn i feel sad for her now i read this \ud83d\ude2a NTA", "Thank you!! Like what the fuck! I feel so sorry for these types of women because I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s some internalized self esteem issue.

Since presumably most people aren\u2019t attracted to objects.\n\nI think there is a deep history of feminist retardant in the idea that normal sexual behavior and attraction is wrong or objectifying.", "In fairness to Casey, she got s**t on twice: first by Josh, then by OP.", "You are right AND the OP should have chosen her words differently.

I can absolutely see why Casey is pissed.  That response to Josh would be quite fine in isolation where no one was around, but in the context she called him ugly and that she would never fancy him, which in turn means that Casey is beneath her for dating him.  She basically said she thinks she is hotter than Casey.  Of course that\u2019s going to hurt Casey!", "OP is not responsible for someone else's misinterpreted subtext when there was never subtext since OP communicated clearly. \n\nBelieve it or not, people can use their words to communicate exactly what they mean without inferring other things. \n\nPeople adding subtext when there is none is a result of their lack of intelligence and projection due to insecurity, and others are not responsible for an insecure's person's  projection.", "Well, they are a colo-rectal surgeon.", "Lol.", "And it was hyyyyyysterical!!!", "In his world it was probably a perfectly normal joking compliment and your answer was the perfect comeback. I wonder if he even realises it upset both of you.", "Of course he doesn\u2019t care. \n\nHis goal wasn\u2019t to express genuine beliefs that he could have anyone he wants and that he should have picked you. \n\nHis goal was to humiliate and denigrate his gf. By \u201cputting him in his place\u201d you *played into* rather than undermined that goal. Tearing him down further tore her down. \n\nHow do people not get that? \n\nESH.", "Luckily? Josh deserved a broken nose for offending both you and his gf imo but I do be crazy", "Thank you. It's a wonder nobody picked up on OP insulting Casey TWICE.", "But whenever I point out that there are a lot of people of my gender, who will literally do anything including demean themselves to have a man I am an asshole, and on some female PUA shit\u2026 Honestly, it\u2019s so so fucking sad how normalize the do anything to not be alone mentality is with women and you have assholes like Josh out there really thinking they could have anyone they want and who impose their standards on everyone while probably being gross themselves. OK rant over.", "Same. This is the saddest part to me. It was an insult to her as well and instead of reflecting on the kind of person josh is, she went off on her friend. Yikes. Casey is not a girls\u2019 girl.", "It's just all red flags with this guy.", "Or just ignore her. Let her be the AH.", "> I am sure she didn\u2019t mean it to come out as a bank shot insult but it was an unfortunate response.\n\nYep. Unintended consequences. She said Josh wasn't good enough for her. Her friend *heard*, \"Yeah, you're good enough for my friend, but obviously I deserve better.\"", "I feel like you\u2019re imagining OP slighting Casey.

Josh could just not be her type, rather than him being not good enough for her. Of course it was (understandably) meant to be an insult the way she said it. \n\nBut Josh's comment followed by OPs does create the overall impression that Josh settled for Casey, which of course she is hurt by. Still unfair to blame OP and not Casey who was the asshole first.", "Ah so true! I didn\u2019t see it that way at first", "Exactly I was just following the semantic train. Safe can mean a number of things and I assumed it would be understood contextually by readers, as I imagine you did as well. Safety is a spectrum of spectra. We don't have enough information to determine exactly where along those spectra this situation exists so we can't infer for sure but abductively the theory tracks.OP was sexualized and disrespected in front of her friend, _by_ her friend's boyfriend, simultaneously insulting and disrespecting her friend in the same act. She rightfully stood up for herself, responding directly to the crude and offensive comments made, then was accosted for it by the friend, who again was just insulted, sexualized, and disrespected immensely by proxy through the person whom she is currently accosting, and is the girlfriend of the person who did the insulting, sexualizing, and disrespecting.\n\nIf you saw it happen in a TV show, you'd be like WTF, and immediately understand there's some other dynamic going on between the boyfriend and girlfriend, unless it's been already set up that the friend is the antagonist but even then it's a show so they'll tell you the story they want to tell you-- this is real life", ":)  You could definitely use the term \"more secure\".", "This take, the one you\u2019re referring to, is the \u201cpeople with low self esteem\u201d take.
