The only one she should be mad at is Josh.", "NTA, and that is an insanely quick comeback.

Which is how compliments work btw. You don\u2019t get to decide that the person you\u2019re \u201ccomplimenting\u201d takes it as a compliment if they don\u2019t see it that way.  \nOP didn\u2019t cause a big scene about it though, just clapped back with a zinger of her own that Josh thought was funny. But she\u2019s an AH in your eyes. \nWhy?  \nShe told Josh that she wouldn\u2019t look at him twice\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean that she thinks he\u2019s ugly, as people are claiming, or that somehow she insulted Casey. Just that she wouldn\u2019t date him. Him making a bold claim of \u201cI picked the wrong girl\u201d being met with \u201cI was never available for you to pick\u201d is a great comeback. It\u2019s the age old \u201cin your dreams\u201d comeback. It\u2019s not necessarily an attack on his looks, or a dig at Casey for dating him.  \nIt\u2019s much more likely to be due to his behaviour, for obvious reasons I hope.  \nBut Josh? He could have just wolf whistled and said she looked hot. Would have been weird in my book, but depends on their friendship dynamics, it\u2019s true.  \nBut he didn\u2019t. He specifically targeted his gf. Basically \u201cyou\u2019re hotter than my gf\u201d in front of everyone. What other way could you interpret \u201cchose the wrong friend\u201d?  \nSo how is OP an AH? For refusing to apologise? For meeting (what OP calls) crass behaviour with a clever but scathing comeback?  \nStrikes me that Casey was understandably upset with the whole situation but feels she can\u2019t go against the bf, likely due to him making demeaning remarks about her which has lowered her self esteem. So she goes for the (perceived) easier target of OP, hoping to guilt her into apologising therefore taking the blame for the drama, so that Casey can go back to pretending that her bf isn\u2019t negging her and everything is fine and dandy.  \nSo why is OP the AH?", "The knowledge is just so poor that it's impossible to do actually coherent analyses", "Or it was a joke?", "Oh I'm not saying OP thinks that way or even meant it that way, I'm just wondering if that's how Casey took it, bc it could be interpreted like that", "I agree- she was inadvertently insulting the friend as well.", "He said he picked the wrong one implying OP was better and all OP said in response was that he wouldn\u2019t have had a shot with her. How tf is she calling her friend unattractive?", "You were spot-on.  Don't understand all these posters that say this is a \"compliment\" - for him maybe, but not for you.  Gotta wonder if these dudes ever get dates with all their \"compliments.\"", "Just reflecting the vibe im getting.", "OP, why are you even friends with u/tdfolts and his girlfriend. It seems like everyone else can see that Casey was wrong here. Let these children find friends that don't mind being sexually objectified.", "Josh is an AH I guess maybe you\u2019re on the wrong sub r/amiwrong might have been a better place to post.  Just put yourself in Casey\u2019s place she was embarrassed by Josh and then how did she feel about herself after your response?", "He did, but OP was thinking on her feet & shouldn't be held equally responsible for a less than stellar reaction after being sexually harassed", "I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what Casey heard. Either way not OPs finest moment, lowering herself to the Josh Level", "Josh is crass and is an asshole but he isn\u2019t who we are asked to be determining who is here.  Just because he is doesn\u2019t mean OP didn\u2019t join him.", "Sounds good to me \nLesson learned keep josh and Casey at arms distance", "Because the reason she gave was that she was the best one out of the friend group. I\u2019m not sure how you don\u2019t get that implication .", "These boys are more offended than Josh was \ud83d\ude02", "I totally agree with you and am confused as to why you are telling me this. What in my original comment makes you think that I think the friend has a right to be annoyed?", "What Casey heard is not OPs responsibility. OP lowering herself to his level would be her sexually harassing him in return, not giving off this pithy little comment.", "She wasn't an asshole for snapping back, she wasn't an asshole for being confused as to why her friend took offense at HER over the boyfriend.", "Seriously. It's like the incel bat signal goes up when someone hears a woman has stood up for herself.", "I would bet a year's salary that 99% of all the Y T A comments are from men.", "I don't? I was defending her saying the friend came over and had a word with HER when friend should've concentrated on gross boyfriend.\n\n\nI was explaining the friends thought process and thought it was a contribution, but I see my phrasing didn't work for you.", "Maybe Josh felt sexually harassed as well? We don\u2019t know.", "You are entitled to your opinion", "While I completely agree with you on this topic, I think people should stop using incel as an insult. It's rooted in the toxic idea that men are only \"real\" men if they have sex. How much sex you have or don't have does not determine your worth. It's basically reverse slut shaming.", "Ok I originally responded to your deleted comment and, yeah, your phrasing made it sound like you were responding to my question. \n\nNot sure why I\u2019ve been downvoted for you miscommunication but ok.", "I\u2019m sorry, how would Josh feel sexually harassed?", "I can understand that position but I respectfully disagree. It's not a term used to insult men who don't have sex. It's a term used for a particular subset of men who think they are entitled to women's bodies and blame women for not submitting to them.", "all incels are involuntarily celibate men but not all involuntarily celibate men are incels. the term refers to a specific group of people with various extreme social and political views. when people use the term as an insult, it's usually because something the person has said aligns with incel ideology.", "Lol honey no", "Seems crazy right?", "Incel in itself is not insulting, but it is often used as a slur. The term has kinda been hijacked for a modern definition to describe young toxic men. Because there are definitely a lot of incels who have very toxic behaviour and attitudes towards women. However the original definition of the term was not necessarily based on any specific toxic male behaviour and also include women.\n\nUsing the word incel is completely fine in my opinion, but I don't think it's constructive to use it as a slur.", "Would you mind answering the question? \n\nCasey was sexually harassed when he made comparative comments about her body.\n\nHow might Josh feel sexually harassed by the conversation as told by OP?"]}
