He will try his \u201cbrutal honesty\u201d stuff on you to see if you\u2019ll let him get away with it, but once you show him you won\u2019t put up with it, he calms down. That said, he\u2019s prone to some stupid remarks. \n\nSo, yesterday we were all having a relaxed day by the pool. I came out of the house in my bikini and Josh wolf whistled and said \u201cdamn I really chose the wrong friend\u201d loud enough for everyone to hear. Without missing a beat I turned to him and said \u201cwhy are you acting like you had your pick of the litter? I would never have looked at you twice and you know it\u201d. \n\nJosh laughed off the comment and and went back to reading his book, but Casey pulled me inside and yelled at me for embarrassing her and Josh. She said what I said was demeaning and I basically called Josh ugly. I was pretty stunned because actually I think what happened was Josh called me a piece of meat. We argued and I basically said that I wasn\u2019t responsible for her boyfriend\u2019s crass behaviour and went back outside.\n\nCasey is still giving me the cold shoulder, as well as the three people who told her she was overreacting. It\u2019s making everything awkward. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here but some of the group have said I was overly cutting with what I said, considering Josh was already out of line. Basically they said I joined him in the gutter.

She was already embarrassed by his (crass, unnecessary) statement, which was increased by your savage (hilarious, accurate) comeback.

I'd be mad if my bf had made such a comment.

But Casey is a big AH for lashing out at you.", "NTA, Casey is more angry at you than at Josh? Who blatantly insulted her by saying he chose the wrong friend? She's likely honestly more upset with him but as you're her friend and not her boyfriend, you're the easier target. I agree with your fiance, both Casey and Josh sound exhausting.

She is hurt bc she has a shitty bf.", "You're NTA. Josh said you are more attractive than Casey, and suggested he should have hooked up with you. You shot that down. And Casey is mad at you? Haha, she's focusing her annoyance on the wrong person.", "NTA!  Josh is rude and your friend may be embarrassed, but, what a disappointment! \n\nGo ahead and rock that bikini and find some new, real friends.", "NTA. Casey is upset because you implied that her boyfriend wasn\u2019t good enough for you.  Based on Josh\u2019s comment, that may very well be true", "NTA, she is displacing her anger. It is easier for her to be hurt and angry at you than it is for her to confront her boyfriend. It's unfair to you, but there's not a lot you can do until she wakes up and realizes that he is a dipshit.", "NTA, if he wolf whistled at you and made a rude comment, you\u2019re fully entitled to banter back.  Laughing was the right response - Casey was in the wrong.", "NTA. Josh is, insulting his girlfriend with the comment. Casey's just insecure and living out her hurt on you, tell her that. Noone likes to be the subject of such jokes, if I was Casey, I'd have dropped him that instant.\n\nJosh:  \u201cDamn I really chose the wrong friend.\u201d\n\nCasey: \"Ok, bro. Choose again then.\"", "NTA, he opened his mouth and you helped him shut it; some people are just real aholes.", "NTA.   \nCasey is saying this is about you putting Josh down.   \nReally Casey is butt hurt because her BF keeps hitting on or making crude remarks to other women. \n\nMutual friends are taking sides because that\u2019s what groups do. Ask them what they\u2019d have said instead\u2026 and let them ponder that. Then change the subject. There\u2019s no winners in the game Josh tried to get you into.   \n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u2018you\u2019 problem, this is a \u2018her\u2019 problem. She should solve it. Date someone who isn\u2019t commenting on others.", "You made a really good response to a crass comment that there was no need for. You hit the nail on the head. Guy\u2019s a jerk.", "NTA, your response was totally appropriate.", "NTA if anything Josh called Casey ugly and she needs to open her eyes. I don\u2019t know wtf is wrong with some women always attacking other people instead of their own men. If my man did that you wouldn\u2019t have to defend yourself because I would be the first to respond to his dumb comment", "NTA her boyfriend hit on you and objectified you and she got pissed... at you. Make it make sense. He was acting like a dog, you had every right to put him in his place. If I were you, I'd cut both of them off. Josh for obvious reason but the gf as well bc she seems like the type to cause drama and blame you if he ever tries to make a move. Best to just avoid the whole mess before it happens.", "you didn't embarrass anyone. josh embarrassed his gf with this comment. i'm surprised casey blames you", "NTA - You\u2019re right. Josh publicly objectified you and you put him in his place.", "I'm sorry, did your friend miss the part where her boyfriend called her less hot than you and implying that he would toss her aside for you? She glossed over the diss at herself and prickled at the insult to him? \n\nHow low is this woman's self-esteem? \n\nNTA\n\nJosh left himself wide open for your response.", "NTA \nSince you stated that your friend group doesn't make comments like that. That is so disrespectful for josh to say to you specially in front of his gf and your bf.\nIf I was casey I wouldn't have let such a comments fly and i definitely wouldn't have blamed you", "NTA. Not even close. Dude needed more than a clue; he needed a step-by-step guidebook.", "Totally NTA. He had it coming , given that his own damn gf was there, your bf was frickin there and he said it loud enough to be heard. You replying was actually the best case scenario. If either your bf or his gf were jealous, it could've ended way worse.", "NTA - He made a joke and you flipped it back round on him. It's really none of your concern if they can dish it out but can't take it back.", "NTA\n\nBut I will say (and this is just how it would be in my friend group)\n\nHe gave you a compliment and you made it 'political'. Not saying it was the most appropriate joke. But in a friend group that's different than saying it to a stranger.\n\nYou could have just taken the compliment and moved on with your day. Instead you let it get to you and got emotional over...words. And will now deal with the fallout of that.\n\nFriend also reacted poorly.\n\nStill NTA though.", "Josh is an AH . But I can see where Casey could have been hurt. \" why are you acting like you had your pick of the litter\".   Really think about this statement.  You basically are saying Casey is not the desired one in the group.", "NTA\n\nCasey should direct her anger at Josh for a) treating her friend like a piece of meat and b) for disrespecting her in front of everyone", "NTA. Josh objectified you and insulted Casey. She took her insecurities out on you probably because you're a safer person to be mad with than he is.", "You are correct.", "NTA and it's weird that Casey is mad at you for putting her boyfriend in his place instead of mad at her boyfriend for not only objectifying her friend, but also basically saying he finds you more attractive and \"chose wrong.\"", "And the funny part is, Josh doesn\u2019t even care. Casey is acting like this on her own.", "Yeah, luckily my fianc\u00e9 is a \u201ctag me in if you need help\u201d kind of guy, not a hothead because that could have got so ugly.", "He objectified her and essentially said she was better looking than his own girlfriend. On what planet was that a compliment?", "You think being objectified and having Josh assume that if he\u2019d wanted me I was there for the taking like a girl on the Bachelor waiting for a rose is a compliment? Mkay. No.", "How did she make it political? She basically said \u201cin your dreams!\u201d And it sounds like Josh had no issue with it.", "Actually, Casey's boyfriend was the one who loudly proclaimed that Casey is not the desired one in the group.  OP just shut him up when he was being rude to both women. Casey's anger is misplaced - she was embarrassed, but not by OP.", "I just meant that he was acting like he was on the Bachelor and it was up to him which girl he went out with, like everyone\u2019s interest in him was just assumed.\n\nI see how it could have come off like that to Casey but I didn\u2019t really say that, Josh did.", "No, Josh said Casey is not the desired one in the group. OP just told Josh that he is not some inherent sex god who can walk into a room and take his pick of any girl he wants.", "Yeah this is a perfect analysis of the situation and it\u2019s sad af.", "Except the comment used to put the boyfriend in his place was an indirect insult of Casey \"you're assuming you had the puck of the litter\" = I'm the best one here buy you couldn't have me so had to get second best ie Casey. Casey's had her boyfriend ogle and objectify her friend, and her friend put her down in the process.", "Tell me about it. Josh didn\u2019t even care about what I said. He\u2019s now mad at her for her bad mood today. Like\u2026I don\u2019t get it.", "Sounds like Casey has her own insecurities- I\u2019d just ignore it and move on.", "Ask Casey why she is OK with your boyfriend saying she's \"the wrong friend\". That's her real issue.  Does she think you should have taken that as a compliment while she was sitting there being insulted?", "100% agree", "That's not even remotely close to what he said... it was literally a compliment but you took it all serious and huffed and puffed. It can be taken as an insult to his own girlfriend maybe (and even that is a maybe cause it's clearly a joke), but certainly not to you... you returned an insult to a compliment. Nice one, you sound like such a positive and fun person.", "how do you reach *this* far?", "This is a stretch. He said picked the wrong friend (implying he could have had OP if he wanted) and she was just saying she was never an option for him. This doesn't even seem to be Casey's issue- she said she was mad because OP called her boyfriend \"ugly\" (which she didn't)", "It's displacement. She ought to be mad at Josh, but that would further emphasize his unattractive qualities, and she's already embarrassed about his crassness.\n\nSo she attacks you instead. Which isn't right.", "Telling a woman to take a gross objectifying comment as a \"compliment.\" How original.", "Yes it what he said. He \u201cpicked\u201d the wrong friend, as if he\u2019d wanted to pick me he could have. That is not the case.\n\nDoes he find me attractive? Sure. If you think that\u2019s a compliment, cool. But the way he said it definitely wasn\u2019t. \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t take it that seriously. If I\u2019d actually been offended, I\u2019d have read him to filth. But I didn\u2019t. I made a snarky comment back which even Josh laughed off and we are fine. Casey is the one reacting to it.", "\"Damn, I chose the wrong friend\"\n\n\"You assume you had the pick of the litter\"\n\nIt's not a reach.", "And implying he would have preferred to have her than Casey. He really managed a sterling job of insulting both women with one \"compliment\".", "Your response was perfect. The criticism of it is based on male facility and nothing else."]}
