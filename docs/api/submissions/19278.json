When we arrived,we open the cheesecake and apparently she have put chocolate syrup all over it and the box/cheesecake itself was an ugly mess....At that point I had a breakdown and started yelling her and crying saying \"WHY YOU KEEP DESTROYING MY WORK,IM SO FED UP WITH YOU\",she kept pushing it off saying \"it's not beautiful enough and it needed a better picture.\n\nI'm way home I wasn't talking her and she started yelling me that I was an assh@le to her in front of everyone and I need to learn manners.\n\nLooking back,I could handle the situation better but I lost my mind,in other hand though I don't want anyone to touch my creations.\n\nAm I the asshole for yelling at my mom in front of everyone?\n\nEdit 1/? : Thanks everyone for your advice,I know my behavior wasn't right and I feel sorry for that,I tried apologizing and point out very calmy my problem,again she brushed my point off.\nI sadly don't have much money from my work so i can't move out but I'd surely buy a small fridge.\n\nSomeone said I should take my results pics before my mom destroys them which is another story that happened\n\nI was once hired for a baptism,the man and I agreed on something after showing him what I can make.After making the sweet again(took pictures of it too) my mom took my pastry cream I had leftover for something else,she remade the sweet the way she wanted (the man sadly didn't have fridge so he ask for a sweet that doesn't need fridge) my mom took the pastry cream and added cream and made it all blue(the man's kid is a daughter by the way)\n\nMy ex's boyfriend mother sees what I see that my mother is envy the attention I get,my ex's bf mother litteraly dump her because she had enough of my mother\n\nEdit 2 : guys I'm a really relax person,I'm fine if you come and advice to add something on my sweets but if you do it WITHOUT asking me that's when I go nuts,I understand it was completely wrong of me to yell in front of everyone and in the past I have expressed how much I don't like her what shes doing.\n\nExample once again. The rose cake I made instead of roses she wanted to add sprinkles all over the cake instead of the flowers..when I added the roses  she wanted to add red circles all over it??? \nI the last I have even cooked with my beloved grandma,she kept advising me stuff and asking if it's right to add or not and I accepted her opinion,in the end the granmda congratulated me and had fun together eating the results with a decent image", "created_utc": 1686222943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1446elr/aita_for_making_a_whole_scene_in_the_family_table/", "score": 7140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a pastry chef, your creations are your artistic expressions, and it's understandable that you want them to be presented the way you envision. It seems like your mother has been disregarding your wishes and consistently altering your sweets without your permission, resulting in disappointment and frustration for you. While it's important to maintain composure and handle conflicts calmly, it's understandable that you reached a breaking point given the repeated instances of your work being altered against your will.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be helpful to have a calm conversation with your mom, expressing your feelings and concerns about how her actions are affecting you. Let her know how much it means to you to have your creations respected and appreciated as they are. It's possible that she may not fully understand the impact of her actions on your emotional well-being and your work. Perhaps you can also discuss finding a compromise or setting clear boundaries when it comes to your pastries.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's natural to have strong emotions when something you're passionate about is consistently tampered with. It's essential to take care of yourself and find ways to protect your creations in the future. Consider investing in a small fridge where you can store your pastries and prevent any unwanted alterations. And always remember that your talent and passion as a pastry chef are invaluable, and your desire for your creations to be enjoyed as you intended is entirely valid.", "NTA she shouldn't touch it if you asked her not to touch it. maybe you didn't need to blow up at her in front of everyone but if you've warned her multiple times i think its fair she deserves to be a little embarrassed in front of everyone since clearly its something you've made and it does not deserve to be ruined. if she wants she can make her own sweets with her own toppings of her choice for her own photos.", "NTA.
