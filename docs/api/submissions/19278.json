It seems like your mother has been disregarding your wishes and consistently altering your sweets without your permission, resulting in disappointment and frustration for you. While it's important to maintain composure and handle conflicts calmly, it's understandable that you reached a breaking point given the repeated instances of your work being altered against your will.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be helpful to have a calm conversation with your mom, expressing your feelings and concerns about how her actions are affecting you. Let her know how much it means to you to have your creations respected and appreciated as they are. It's possible that she may not fully understand the impact of her actions on your emotional well-being and your work. Perhaps you can also discuss finding a compromise or setting clear boundaries when it comes to your pastries.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's natural to have strong emotions when something you're passionate about is consistently tampered with. It's essential to take care of yourself and find ways to protect your creations in the future. Consider investing in a small fridge where you can store your pastries and prevent any unwanted alterations.
