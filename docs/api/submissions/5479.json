Yes, I click the notification and wife has been texting a friend about how the next two weeks are going to be torture. Yes, I dig a little deeper and similar messages to multiple (at least 4) people like this.\n\nThis in itself isn't that bad tbh, but some context is needed.\n\nContext: we both grew up in different cities (her in City A and me in City B). We started our lives and family together in B. Both her brothers moved from A to B. Or first child was the first grandchild of her parents, and they would come to visit for 2-3 weeks at a time and stay with us. We also decided that since we lived near my parents, we would alternate annual holidays as follows: year 1 - 1 week inc christmas with my folks, then 1 week with her folks. Year 2 - 2 weeks with her folks (one week at their house in City A then 1 week at a holiday town 90min drive away from City A). I've never complained to anyone about the long durations with my in-laws other than get a bit anti-social and disappear to the bedroom / office etc. \n\nLast Nov we moved to City A. So this year we agreed that we would spend the holiday with my parents, and it would be at the holiday town 90min away (where her family has always holidayed and will be visiting in the second week of our holiday, but staying in a different house)\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, my father-in-law asks if we can drive back to City A for Christmas Eve dinner so all his grandkids can be together as one of his sons hasn't had Christmas with them for a few years and the other son had a baby this year so will be the first time all the grandkids can be together. I immediately say sure, no problem, but can we make it a lunch do so we can get back to holiday town for Christmas setup for kids to open presents there in the morning, and yes this was the plan because it's about the grandkids being together. All cool.\n\nSo all is fine until I see these messages. When I confront her about it she gets defensive and says that she'd rather just go back home if I'm going to be upset with her, saying do I want her to go or not (note we have a 2yo and 4yo, so I don't know what the logistics plan would be here). I just reply saying I'm not going to hold her hostage with my parents for 2 weeks, if she wants to go she must.\n\nNow we're supposed to be going back to A tomorrow for Christmas lunch with her family, and I'm kinda feeling like fuck it, no, she can go with the kids on her own.\n\nAnyway, bit of a rant, but AITA?\n\nEdit: clear I am the asshole for snooping. This was pretty clear to me even before I posted this. What I'm after is AITA for being unhappy that for 3 years prior to this when we lived far from her folks, multiple long visits by her parents to us were 'fine' and when I brought it up I was seriously guilt tripped because she never got to see them and they wanted to spend time with grandkids, but now that the shoe is on the other foot it's a different story.\n\nEdit 2: things I've learned from this:\n1. Snooping is an absolute nono.\n2. I need to not take messages like this too seriously \n3. I need to learn to vent instead of bottling up.\nThank you everyone for the perspective.", "created_utc": 1671836202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztv4gu/aita_for_calling_my_wife_out_for_messaging/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First off you shouldn't be punishing your spouse, second off you choosing not to act like a father and a partner because you're angry is really fucked up. \n\nYou invaded your wife's privacy, are trying to punish her, and generally not treating her like your equal.

I just drink on the rare occasion when I go to the in-laws\u2026 and keep a running commentary to my besties about the drama lmao\u2014but my situation is a bit different, even by husband doesn\u2019t like his dad and is LC (long story)", "Hell I'd find 2 weeks with my own parents more than a challenge and we are really close.", "Thanks for explaining. Happy with that.", "Exactly. My hubby better not read or listen to what I say to my friends and family about my in laws. I do the same. We all have a right to vent. Why on earth did you read messages on her phone ? It's not your place. YTA.", "Right? I live over a thousand miles from my family and spend a week at a time and by the end of it I'm climbing the walls, i can't imagine how my partner feels. Hell i vented to my friend about spending two days with my in laws last weekend (and then we got COVID so justified complaint i say)", "Yep. Phone snooping is not cool", "City B is 1000miles away. So a bit of info lacking there I suppose.\n\nOther point taken.", "A bit aggressive. Looking on her phone as she has iphone and kid has ipad. I have a great coloring app on my phone that has colour by numbers and waterpainting an various other options on Android and on my son's Android tablet. So was searching for an ios equivalent.\n\nPoint taken though.", "The extra driving was her and her father's request that I agreed to. Happy with the explanation on the rest.", "Multiple engineers in my family. I felt this.", "I am an engineer.\n\nTldr: when we lived far from her parents, I had to suck up multiple long term visits from her parents without complaint. When we live far from my parents, she can badmouth my parents.\n\nYes, I am the asshole for snooping.", "OP is also venting about the situation and getting opinions from strangers, but apparently that\u2019s _different_ than what she\u2019s doing. \n\nThe hypocrisy, it burns sometimes.", "How the hypocrite. Help see here.", "Ok, but why? Help me see and improve.", "That's what she said - thanks. It's still really hurtful though and I know if I'd sent similar messages to my friends about her family it would be the end of the world.\n\nEdit. Not a sarcastic thanks, more a Thanks for confirming that they're not serious hate comments Bout time with my family.", "The issue here is not that she vented, she's allowed to vent. The issue here is he searched through all of her conversations with her friends and confronted her for venting. He is specifically framing that she is not allowed to complain, to her friends, about having to spend time with his parents for 2 weeks. \n\nHe is an asshole for going after her and especially given that he is saying that the only unnecessary travel in this situation is seeing her parents.", "I can. Her parents want the grandkids with them.", "Probably because it\u2019s just venting which I do so with my friends more than my husband. Assuming his wife is the same. I love my in laws but would find two week very tortuous and would absolutely be bitching to my friends in a group chat about it all with an air of non seriousness. Just how you talk to friends sometimes. It\u2019s nice to have a venting outlet.", "Sorry but what is ESH.\n\nI'm upset that when I brought up the long durations her folks would stay with her previously, I was guilt tripped but now when she has to spend time with my folks she gets to vent.", "Phones have passcodes, but we both use the same one, and don't necessarily use each other's phones, but neither are secrets.", "I know exactly which post this was supposed to be made on lmao", "1 set of parents lives 800m away and 1 set of parents lived 1600km away. So slightly different but point taken.", "Did you never vent to your friends or family during previous years?", "You really needed this written out for you?", "Going against the grain here but I don't think you're Y T A. People are calling you hypocrite because you're \"venting to us\", but you haven't said anything bad about her parents or that you don't like them or anything. More than that, you would've never come here to complain about all the time spent with her family if it weren't because you found out she takes issue to spending time with yours.\n\nYou already know that going through her messages isn't right, so I'm not going to keep beating a dead horse. However, I do think you should talk to your wife to find out if there is something in particular she doesn't like about your parents, or if it's just the typical \"spending a prolonged time in someone else's house is always a hassle\" kind of thing. Do it in a way that ensures that she feels safe being honest with you, do not judge her. Then, depending on what she says, you can try to find a compromise so you can meet each other half-way when it comes to all the family visits.\n\nIn any case, I don't blame you for feeling hurt about it when you've been so accommodating to her family, and I can't blame your wife for the way she feels when she is pushing those feelings aside and planning to go with you either way. So, communicate! \n\n NAH.\n\nEdit: People really be downvoting anyone who isn't willing to tear OP a new one \ud83d\ude02", "1000 or 100 miles away? Are you flying or driving? I have a headache just trying to keep up with your cities A and B and then the other town thrown in. And all of this with a 2 year old and 4 year old? \n\nMay I ask who\u2019s in charge of packing and making sure the kids will have everything they need for the trip? Who\u2019s packing the suitcases, doing laundry, cleaning the house before you leave, etc? I need to drink a bottle of wine just after reading this. I can\u2019t imagine what your wife is feeling with all the stress of planning and packing for a 2 week trip with 2 young kids, plus 2 weeks with the in-laws. You need to buy spa packages for your wife and her friends to thank them for having your wife\u2019s back and to thank your wife for doing all of this for you.", "Come on, dude. You made a choice to click on the notification - this wasn\u2019t an accident on your part. Of course YTA.", "you chose to click on the notification and then went through multiple conversations.", "It's appropriate. You invaded her private conversations", "Seems like an excuse bud.", "Wait what the hell do you think is the extra driving? Seeing her parents at all?", "I don\u2019t think anyone would\u2019ve blamed you if you bitched to your buddies about your in-laws staying at your house for weeks; however, you chose not to do that. \n\nGees, even if I liked my (former) in-laws, spending 2 weeks with them would\u2019ve been hell. You should be thankful that your wife has friends that she can vent to. \n\nYTA\u2014Get over yourself.", "Did you ever consider that she might assume that you vented to your friends or siblings when her parents were there for long term visits?\n\nThat's the rule of relationships - no matter how much our in-laws annoy us, as long as they aren't violating relationship rules (ie, the stuff you see throughout AITA) you don't complain to your spouse, but instead you complain to your friends, your own family, your coworkers, or a bartender that you tip well.", "Were you not allowed to complain or did you choose not to?", "Nobody would have a problem with you messaging your homies to bitch about your inlaws.  Extend her the same courtesy.  I don't consider the snooping an issue.  Only you whinging about what you read.", "Seriously, like I want a glimpse into his brain to see how this makes sense to him", "You shipped in her phone and saw she was venting to some friends.  Now you're here on Reddit venting to thousands of strangers.  She is allowed to not be excited to spend extended time with her in-laws.  She is allowed to vent to her friends.  You're butthurt she isn't 100% psyched to have to keep kids wrangled and be \"on\" 24/7 for days upon days.  She's venting, yet completely willing to do it for you.  She never complained to you.  You should apologize to her for snooping and for trying to police her private conversations and thought.  And, obviously, YTA.", "You are venting about how you are mad she is venting. Why do you get an outlet but she can\u2019t have one?", "You went snooping through your wife\u2019s messages.  *Multiple* private conversations between her and her friends.  \n\nShe\u2019s not happy about spending 2 weeks with her in-laws.  Who would be?  I love my in-laws.  They\u2019re super nice people who dote on me every time I visit.  But 2 weeks would have me climbing the walls and boiling in my own brain.  \n\n2 weeks with *anyone* is a long time to be away from home.  Especially with young children!  But your wife was willing to do it so you could see your family.  She just needed to commiserate and vent, and get some support from her friends.  That\u2019s something friends do for each other.  2 weeks is a long time with anybody, but add in 2 young kids and the fact that she\u2019s staying with *in-laws*, no wonder she needed to reach out to friends for support!!!\n\nBut you had to not only go snooping, but then use her friends\u2019 commiseration and support against her.  Wtf?", "You couldn't help that you saw the text notification,but you shouldn't have clicked on it,and you shouldn't have further invaded her privacy by digging deeper into her conversation history. Instead of,\"confronting\" her,a better route would have been to go to her and tell her you saw the text from her friend while borrowing her phone,and ask her what it is about the situation that is difficult for her,and have a respectful conversation about it rather then just getting angry at her.", "Okay. YTA still for snooping and doing exactly what you're saying she would do", "You're taking this waaayyyyy too seriously. Most people can't be bothered by other people's relatives. It is hard enough dealing with your own. Don't create problems when none exist! Chill out.", "Isn't there a saying out there about snooping leading to hurt feelings.. Guess op never heard that one", "[removed]", "Then why are you framing it like it's a punishment where you're just going to dump the kids on her and fuck off and not be a dad or a partner during that time?", "Everyone Sucks Here. \n\nYes, I agree that she sucks for pulling the guilt trip on you for the same feelings vice versa. But the difference is that you complained to her about visits. That would suggest you wanted her to stop or curtail the visits with her family. She did not do that to you. You had to snoop to find out she's doesn't enjoy visits with your family. She chose not to pressure you to change your family visits. She just sucks it up and tolerates them for your sake.", "Yes but didn't you guys just recently move?\n\nAlso how is your and her relationship with each others parents?", "Nope. Sucked it up 'like a good husband'.", "Thanks for the constructive feedback. I'll try get more info and make it easier.", "Yes seriously, this wasn't the message popping up on screen, you rifled through her inbox and scrolled through those conversations. It's a massive invasion of privacy", "Ok", "We live 800m away from her parents. We see them every weekend.", "TIL. Thank you.", "Was really guilt tripped for bringing it up with her (because they live far away and she never gets to see them and they never get to see their grandkids).", "I love my in-laws too and 2 weeks is A LOT of time to spend together. Even they don't enjoy that much time in each other's spaces if we can't get some regular breaks.

You should have complained to your own friends!", "Yeah cuz you're literally complaining about having to see her parents at all, when she is trying to form a relationship between them and her kids. It is absolutely inappropriate for you to complain to your wife about the terrible trial it is to have any contact with her parents.\n\nThat's why you vent to friends", "I think you blew it up more then it needed to be.
