Yes, I click the notification and wife has been texting a friend about how the next two weeks are going to be torture. Yes, I dig a little deeper and similar messages to multiple (at least 4) people like this.\n\nThis in itself isn't that bad tbh, but some context is needed.\n\nContext: we both grew up in different cities (her in City A and me in City B). We started our lives and family together in B. Both her brothers moved from A to B. Or first child was the first grandchild of her parents, and they would come to visit for 2-3 weeks at a time and stay with us. We also decided that since we lived near my parents, we would alternate annual holidays as follows: year 1 - 1 week inc christmas with my folks, then 1 week with her folks. Year 2 - 2 weeks with her folks (one week at their house in City A then 1 week at a holiday town 90min drive away from City A). I've never complained to anyone about the long durations with my in-laws other than get a bit anti-social and disappear to the bedroom / office etc. \n\nLast Nov we moved to City A. So this year we agreed that we would spend the holiday with my parents, and it would be at the holiday town 90min away (where her family has always holidayed and will be visiting in the second week of our holiday, but staying in a different house)\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, my father-in-law asks if we can drive back to City A for Christmas Eve dinner so all his grandkids can be together as one of his sons hasn't had Christmas with them for a few years and the other son had a baby this year so will be the first time all the grandkids can be together. I immediately say sure, no problem, but can we make it a lunch do so we can get back to holiday town for Christmas setup for kids to open presents there in the morning, and yes this was the plan because it's about the grandkids being together. All cool.\n\nSo all is fine until I see these messages. When I confront her about it she gets defensive and says that she'd rather just go back home if I'm going to be upset with her, saying do I want her to go or not (note we have a 2yo and 4yo, so I don't know what the logistics plan would be here). I just reply saying I'm not going to hold her hostage with my parents for 2 weeks, if she wants to go she must.\n\nNow we're supposed to be going back to A tomorrow for Christmas lunch with her family, and I'm kinda feeling like fuck it, no, she can go with the kids on her own.\n\nAnyway, bit of a rant, but AITA?\n\nEdit: clear I am the asshole for snooping. This was pretty clear to me even before I posted this. What I'm after is AITA for being unhappy that for 3 years prior to this when we lived far from her folks, multiple long visits by her parents to us were 'fine' and when I brought it up I was seriously guilt tripped because she never got to see them and they wanted to spend time with grandkids, but now that the shoe is on the other foot it's a different story.\n\nEdit 2: things I've learned from this:\n1. Snooping is an absolute nono.\n2. I need to not take messages like this too seriously \n3. I need to learn to vent instead of bottling up.\nThank you everyone for the perspective.", "created_utc": 1671836202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztv4gu/aita_for_calling_my_wife_out_for_messaging/", "score": 869, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah it's okay for her to be defensive, when you're confronting her for having feelings.\n\nYour solution for her was that she wouldn't be able to see her kids for that entire time since they were entirely brought to give your parents pleasure, and your answer now is that you're just going to dump your kids on to her to punish her. First off you shouldn't be punishing your spouse, second off you choosing not to act like a father and a partner because you're angry is really fucked up. \n\nYou invaded your wife's privacy, are trying to punish her, and generally not treating her like your equal.

I live over a thousand miles from my family and spend a week at a time and by the end of it I'm climbing the walls, i can't imagine how my partner feels.

More than that, you would've never come here to complain about all the time spent with her family if it weren't because you found out she takes issue to spending time with yours.\n\nYou already know that going through her messages isn't right, so I'm not going to keep beating a dead horse. However, I do think you should talk to your wife to find out if there is something in particular she doesn't like about your parents, or if it's just the typical \"spending a prolonged time in someone else's house is always a hassle\" kind of thing. Do it in a way that ensures that she feels safe being honest with you, do not judge her. Then, depending on what she says, you can try to find a compromise so you can meet each other half-way when it comes to all the family visits.\n\nIn any case, I don't blame you for feeling hurt about it when you've been so accommodating to her family, and I can't blame your wife for the way she feels when she is pushing those feelings aside and planning to go with you either way.

She didn\u2019t intend for you to see those texts but she clearly wasn\u2019t hiding them either. If she does find days at a time with your family hard, she has tried to be gracious about it. But these things always find a way of coming back round to the person being spoken about. Certain women tend to think that the maternal grandmother always gets dibs and it sounds like that\u2019s true for your wife: this attitude is harmful and misogynistic and she needs to realise that quality time with your parents is important to you, not least because otherwise she might have an unequal relationship with her own children if the 2yo is a boy. \n\nIf she didn\u2019t intend to hurt your parents, and it was just some harmless venting as she says, then she needs to treat them as more than the subject of her \u2018look what a good wife I am, allowing my husband to still see his mother\u2019 banter with her friends.", "YTA.

The husband is often oblivious to how it makes his wife feel, gaslights her and prioritizes keeping the peace with mom which is why i suggest taking notes.\n\nIf you find yourself constantly saying to your wife that she's taking it the wrong way and mil really loves her, the problem is *not* your wife.\n\nOtherwise its probably just all the general stress of travel and being switched on as a guest in someone elses home for so long .

Don't judge her for handling her frustration differently than you. You're the one who invaded her privacy (which I believe spouses should have access to each other's phones, even if others disagree). But if you choose to look at her private messages, don't get mad about finding things you don't like. She's not cheating on you or publicly embarrassing you. The truth is that she's not looking forward to visiting your family. That's OK! Be thankful she's still willing to go through with it to show you love and keep the peace. In the meantime, she has a right to express her true feelings privately to her friends about the upcoming visit.
