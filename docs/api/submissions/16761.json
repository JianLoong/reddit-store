Our neighbor got a really nice SAFE one that was easily removed once the need was gone.  They need to come up with a solution that doesn't block your egress, that could be dangerous for you. Often Medicare or a social worker can help them navigate the system to get essential help. NAH.", "Ugh I was ready to say YTA but if you think it is unpermitted and possibly unsafe (not up to code re: level of incline) AND it is evidently or potentially on your property, I am wondering if there is a potential for liability that you face in the event of an issue with the ramp. If so, I think you have to speak to them about having it moved/removed and report to the city if they don't. It's obviously wildly inconsiderate for them to have constructed it in a way that blocks your access to features of your own home and outbuildings, and it seems like there should be an answer that can work for them without doing those things or leaving you with liability. So.. ugh... NTA.", "NTA because of the safety issues, plus it's a horrible inconvenience, but I can see why you feel bad about reporting it. Do you know anyone handy? A ramp isn't usually hard to build, but this one sounds like a monstrosity. You don't have to, and you don't have any real reason to feel guilty, but since you do, maybe see if there're any local resources or something so you could approach them with some alternatives. There may not be anything though and if she falls, or the husband falls trying to help her, they will be even worse off.", "As someone who works for a city and really hates when people use my job as a tattle tale line \u2014 this one needs to be reported. You\u2019re right certain things  are unsafe and that\u2019s why there\u2019s rules about obtaining permits, when to use a contractor versus DIY, site plans, egress, and setbacks. It\u2019s violating all of that. It\u2019s unsafe and unfair to both of you. NTA.", "Ok talk to them first but this might be a lawyer thing.  Leaving it in place could create a permanent easement where you lose property rights.  NTA.", "Info: did you ask them to move the ramp, or get rid of it and install one that doesn't block your property?", "Try problem solving with them first.  They are already struggling and you will make things much worse for them and your relationship by going to the city.", "NTA. It\u2019s totally reasonable for you to be upset about this, I know I would be. They could have at the very minimum made you aware that they were thinking of putting in a ramp. Now that it\u2019s blocking part of your entryway, you have every right to make a call about this. Don\u2019t feel bad, if they were really the nice neighbors you say they are then they could have made you aware of this!", "I\u2019m fairly sure you can report to the city anonymously. At least you can where I\u2019m from.", "NTA\n\nPrimarily because of the safety concerns of all and secondary to the issue of them blocking your entrance. It bot being up to code because of the steep incline would fall under safety.", "The ramp comes from the second story? That sounds frightening. Seems like they need a front door ramp with a chair lift for their stairs.\n\nNTA", "NTA, if it\u2019s on your property make them move it.", "NTA, have your insurance agent come by to check things out. If it opens you to any liability (most likely will) it can't remain there. Then give them x time to rectify before you call the city. Be understanding and firm, not aggressive. If you can blame it on insurance it may help.", "depends. you\u2019re not wrong in your frustration but there\u2019s a lot to consider. are you able to talk to them first, have you already, would they be understanding? Is it something they can fix? i\u2019m not sure how it would play out if you contact the city, like if they would fine them or anything, if they would fine them then i\u2019d say obviously try everything else first. It would just suck to get them in trouble and get the city involved if they would have been willing to fix it without all that.", "NTA because you have tried to address this with them and because it actually affects you versus people who just don\u2019t like the look. There are likely numerous legal options that don\u2019t affect your access. Unfortunately, sounds like you need to report this.", "Talk to them before you contact the city and cause them to pay a likely large fine.", "ESH. Your neighbor sucks for doing this, but you also suck for going to the City instead of addressing it with them directly.  Go over and talk to them.  Bring a treat and try to be neighborly.  Be firm.  Tell them you appreciate their difficulty but it\u2019s not acceptable to impair your use of your property.  Tell them you want to remain friendly and don\u2019t want a legal dispute.  Follow up with an email or letter.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work you\u2019re probably going to have to hire a lawyer.  The Planning Department isn\u2019t going to make them do anything even if it does violate their rules.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I did \u2026 She begged to keep it where it was and states it\u2019s temporary.

The incline is very, very important. If it\u2019s too steep then it\u2019s a danger! \n\nPlease report it.

It would be highly detrimental to kick up a fuss only to learn that the land is 90% theirs, the ramp is entirely on their property and you\u2019ve been using the \u201cshared\u201d gate through their kindness and generosity. See what I\u2019m saying?\n\nOnce confirmed that the ramp encroaches on your property do not feel a moment\u2019s anxiety about reporting it.
