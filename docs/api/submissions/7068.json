If she's as bad as you say she is, you're setting yourself up for failure, because she's not going to abide by your rules of decency/common sense. I think you really need to reconsider inviting her/having her there because if she's as bad as it seems, she's absolutely going to find a way to ruin your big day.", "NTA for not wanting your MIL there but these rules aren\u2019t going to work. In fact, you\u2019re giving her directions on how to piss you off and you better believe she\u2019s going to do at least one of these things. \n\nAnd how do you expect to enforce these rules?  \u201cYou will be removed from the wedding\u201d is great and all but are you going to have two buff dudes give her the bum\u2019s rush?\n\nETA: the way these are written, if your MIL had these in writing and showed it to her friends, you wouldn\u2019t come off looking that great. Again, don\u2019t disagree with the sentiment given past history but just FYI.", "NTA but given your description of her, she could easily use your rules list as a do list.", "If you have to give her that many rules, then you shouldn\u2019t invite his mother. The type of person you\u2019re describing won\u2019t be deterred from causing problems because you have her a list. NTA.", "Yes, this is too much, but not because you\u2019re in the wrong.\n\nWhy set rules for MIL? She\u2019s likely not to follow them.\n\nI know you say not inviting her is not an option, but it\u2019s actually the best solution. If you invite her, you\u2019ll be having to put MIL in the corner for time out every five seconds because she won\u2019t stop misbehaving.\n\n**NTA**\u2026 but consider how much less stress you\u2019d have if you simply retract the invitation.", "NTA but I think there is overlap between rule 4, 5 and 7 so I'd condense this. Like just 'please be respectful'. \n\nI'll be honest, I don't get why you're inviting her. If you've got the guts to give her this list and deal with the fallout...why not just go the whole hog. On the bright side, once she sees your rules she might be so offended she decides nor to attend. If someone gave me this, I'd tell them to jog on (but tbh I know how to behave myself so perhaps it is different).", "NTA. But you might need to hire some security to enforce the rules so you don't have to do this yourself. Hopefully, you can have security there to handle things so you are not even aware of any issues and can enjoy your day. Congratulations!", "NTA  for those rules. But if those are really necessary then I think you should reconsider inviting her. What joy will she bring to your wedding?", "ESH. Ha! Like your MIL is going to bow to all of these rules! From what you have said about her, expect some serious grandstanding and attention seeking just to piss you off. I know I would. Is this a wedding or Gulag? Make space in those rules to just relax and have a good time, and you might find that everything just falls into place anyway. Good luck", "NTA as those are reasonable rules.", "NTA. You'd be much better off not inviting her. She doesn't sound as if she will care about any of this and will go out of her way to be a problem", "NTA.\n\nThey are perfectly reasonable rules that for the most part people should already know without having to be told.  Maybe the phone/camera rule and no toast rule might be the only ones that are not already expected or part of already well established rules.  If I attended a wedding, I'd have my phone in my purse, hopefully silenced.  You can always ask the officiant to make an announcement that people silence and put away their phone before you even do your wedding march.  Will you have someone officially live streaming your wedding for guests who are unable to attend?  They may be the only exception to that rule if you do.\n\nAnd is any color for a dress besides white okay with you?  If so, you may want to just say please dress formally, and don't wear white/off white/Ivory/ or any color that could be misconstrued as white. The way you word that makes me think you're asking for a certain set of specific colors to be worn.\n\nTry to relax though.  Maybe even ask someone you trust to be on MIL watch to sort of babysit her if you distrust her that much.  Someone who loves you enough not to mind that burden.  Maybe a really close friend who couldn't be in the wedding party won't mind wrangling her for you if need be.", "NTA for setting these rules - they're actually pretty reasonable. But I agree with others - she will find a way to break or bend every one of them .\n\nI'd suggest that you put her up in a hotel room many miles away and set up a one way video link. That way she can see the ceremony - which is all you want her to do anyway - without the opportunity (or temptation) to cause drama and diminish you and your partner's enjoyment of your big day. \n\nAlso, make sure that she knows this is her only option. If she turns up in person she'll be refused entry and won't ever get to see the wedding.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you decide what you want. Period. If she doesn't like it, she doesn't have to come.", "NTA, but I'm dubious about phones and cameras.  Maybe if you clarify it's only during the ceremony itself, and photos are okay after the ceremony and at the reception?\n\nIf she's really bad, this will fail.  Have a couple people assigned in advance to babysit and remove her, and expect literal screaming and/or vicious posts and texts afterward.  But still less third-party drama than if you don't invite her.", "NTA, but she's not going to stick to your rules. You know that. She needs a minder the entire time, just like a toddler does. You're going to be stressed waiting for the other shoe to drop.", "Just don't invite her.\n\nA true narcissist isn't going to care about any rules you set.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Good luck enforcing those rules she is going to ignore each and everyone....You'd be better off having no rules and just ignoring her. Get a sympathetic relative to run point on her and keep her away from you both instead.\n\nFar from TA.", "NTA\u2026.because aren\u2019t most of these rules just how all guests should be behaving at a wedding anyway?", "NTA, but rules do not apply to narcissist. You may want to adjust your expectation of her and have a plan B to remove her if needed.", "I don\u2019t think anyone can judge you on this... you\u2019re the only one who knows best about her behavior. Give her the list. What\u2019s the worst that happens?... she does everything you already think she\u2019s going to do & turns the attention on her. \n\nI\u2019m a wedding planner so I will give you this advice \u2014 you can NOT control what other adults will do. Ignore them! They will not ruin your day unless you allow them to. Ask a trusted friend to be in charge of Mom... if he/she sees any crazy nonsense have them intervene. Her behavior will only be a reflection of her it won\u2019t change you & your fianc\u00e9\u2019s day. Trust me, no one will care if she acts the fool unless you get involved. Wish you all the best!!\n\nNTA", "NTA- \n\nbut you're not going to get her to follow these rules... Because these are more or less the rules/situation at any wedding and the degree you are spelling them out suggests she can't be expected to not make a complete and total scene.... So just don't have her there. Make sure security knows she can't attend. Then enjoy your actual wedding. It's your wedding ... And even if you give her these rules and she agrees peacefully (nope, not going to happen) than you're going to still have a problem at the wedding... \n\nAnd then what? \n\nYou're going to wave around a paper with rules and say \"but we told you to behave reasonable?\" \n\nThis sounds like a lot of playing around to ultimately ensure that there absolutely is a scene... Because now you've told her exactly the many ways that she can ruin things when she feels like it AND if you don't give her a specific rule she's going to pretend like she couldn't possibly know how to reasonably behave... \n\nSounds like you're spending a lot of energy paying attention to her because it's 'not an option not to invite her'...and narcissists love attention, so i guess you're down for the eventual scene and whatever way she spins this list of rules to your friends and family as some sort of personal insult and crime.... And you're gonna have to deal with that all the up to and past the wedding as well.", "I think rather than make rules at your MIL assign her a handler and make the rules public with a clear expectation that they apply to everyone. \n\nThat way there is a baseline understanding that if she tries to act up people know she\u2019s doing it to spite you. \n\nAlso, having an assigned handler to run interference would hopefully nip most of her shenanigans in the bud. \n\nBut NTA and congrats on getting married!", "NTA, but if you need to make a list like that there is a 0% chance MIL will obey them. She's going to violate those rules just to spite you.", "NTA - but these rules need to be coming from your partner's mouth/or written by him. It's his responsibility to handle his mother and set the boundaries for his new relationship with her.\n\nAlso when you tend to spell out \"do NOT do xyz\" the rebels tend to do exactly xyz. I would personally try to handle your MIL in a different way but I understand it's so rough.", "If she has proved on previous occasions that she can't behave properly, those rules are OK. Have you made sure the rules can be enforced? I.e. do you have someone there who can manhandle her and walk her off the venue? I would make sure about that. NTA.", "Those are basic manners  that everyone should follow, not over-the-top rules.  If she has to be told this stuff, man.  Have one of your bridal party members serve as spotter so you can nip bad behavior in the bud.\n\nGood luck.  NTA, however, as another poster has pointed out, you are literally giving her a list of triggers that she can use on you for the rest of your life.  I'd just not invite her.  You don't have to, you know?", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding, not hers", "NTA - The Rules are NOT too much, BUT HOW ARE YOU GOIG TO ENFORCE THEM?  Any attempt to do so will result in EXACTLY what you are trying to avoid, a scene.\n\nHave you had ANY experience with her following guidelines before?\n\nBetter to not invite her, than to be on edge, waiting for the drama to begin.", "NTA. But if your MIL is a narcissist, it doesn\u2019t matter how many rules you set, she will still think they don\u2019t apply to her. My advice is don\u2019t let her come. You and your fianc\u00e9 will be much happier and less stressed. Otherwise, you are dealing with the drama of your MIL the moment she walks in the venue and the stress of having to kick her out at some point. And you will have to kick her out. So have a person appointed to do so if she comes.", "NTA, but incredibly naive if you think a list of rules are going to matter at all to your Monster-in-Law.", "NTA, but your fiance should be the one to deliver the message to her and express it as his own decision. \n\nHe also needs to be ready and willing to enforce it.  If he can't or won't do that, the rules will be treated as a guideline for MIL to follow to piss you off intentionally. Have a talk with him, if he thinks it's a problem and honestly wouldn't kick her out if it came down to it, do not invite her at all.", "NTA but I'd say don't invite her at all. You know she's going to show up in white and make a scene as she's escorted out.", "camera thing might be a bit close to the too much side but if you have specific shots you want  to get for the wedding and not having anyone interfere that is cool  \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\nexcept maaaaaaabey to yourselves for allowing her to attend, but that is a risk you calculated, perhaps get a security guard to keep an eye on her", "I mean, nta for having rules for your wedding, but in reality you're just giving her a list of specific things to do that will bother you. \n\nFWIW if she truly does have tendencies described as narcissistic I have found the best way to deal with someone like that is to have absolutely zero cares and smile and nod basically while doing what I'd normally do anyway. ymmv.", "Then you're f'ed.", "NTA - you've pretty much given her a checklist of things to do to upset you, if she didn't have one already. Save yourself extra stress and don't invite her at all.", "NTA \n\nYou are quite naive if you expect her to comply with your rules, though.", "NTA bit settings these rules already is a red flag to your MIL.

Your wedding so its your rules but this post doesnt come across objective - has she said anything specific about the wedding to make you believe she wouldnt behave? \n\nThis seems like *a lot* of rules, so much so that I\u2019m wondering why youre even inviting her.

Maybe there\u2019s someone who could ask her on a shopping trip to make sure she gets something appropriate to wear that she\u2019s excited about, for example. Maybe make sure she\u2019s seated next to someone in the ceremony who\u2019s keeping an eye out for her phone to come out of her purse.

She will ignore everything if it comes from you.", ">were kinda f'ed if we do, f'ed if we don't \n\nThen don't lol\nIf it's a lose-lose situation then pick the loss that's the least stressful and most enjoyable. Don't invite her. She's a spiteful woman that will always look for her \"win\", her way to show she has power and control. She will find a reason to justify whatever she does to ruin your day.", "NTA \n\nSeriously though, she's not going to abide by those rules and she will try to ruin your day. Just uninvite her; the fallout from not having her will pale in comparison to whatever shit she gets up to", "NTA.  Three quarters of these rules shouldn't have to be said - that's just normal adult behavior.  The fact that you feel the need to spell them out is scary.  If MIL is really that bad, then perhaps OP's fiance should just not invite his mother.  No matter what, if you disinvite her, it has to come as his decision and not OP's (and he's the one that tells her).\n\nThere are a couple of options that I can think of.\n\nOnly invite her to the ceremony and not the reception.  \n\nLive stream the wedding (not reception) and let her watch from home.  At least this way she can see her son get married but can't cause any issues.\n\nIf she's as bad as these rules indicate she is, then I would absolutely expect her to do something to ruin OP's wedding - regardless of whether she accepts the rules or not.", "NTA. Sounds like you're damned if you and damned if you don't. So don't invite the MIL to the wedding and skip the drama.", ">To start let me first say that I (23F) and my fiance (25M) dont even really want her to even be there. \n\nIf this is a real statement for both of you. Then don't invite her.", "OP, your MIL is totally going to use any set of rules as a list of things she needs to do to spite you.  Unless you have consequences and an enforcer, you're just going to create pain for yourself.", "to put this lightly.. she is pretty dumb. and im genuinely not trying to say that to be mean she is very uneducated and likes to believe shes the smartest person in the room when shes not. she also is manipulative and narcisistic to people who dont know what those two words mean. meaning that its very easy to recognize when you arent as dumb as she is, unfortunately for me, most of his family doesnt know the meaning of the words so they dont know theyre being manipulated. they base their opinion on whos older pretty much, whoevers older is always right. that being said i dont feel as though it will be hard to play her own game. its like dealing with a 12 yr old spoiled brat more than an evil mastermind", "Good luck with that. Its been over 50 years for me, its gotten much worse."]}
