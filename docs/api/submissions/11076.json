The kid is, to say the least, difficult. She tries therapy, daycare, lots of educational methods but he's wild, cries a lot, destroys stuff, yells with her, anyway you get the picture. \n\nThe dad pays pension but isn't active in their lives and she doesn't have many family members nearby, so she's pretty much alone most of the time to deal with this. Poor thing is destroyed. Whenever we hang out it's clear from her physical appearance that she isn't very healthy and she is always tired and anxious. She takes meds but her doctor said that unfortunately there isn't much to do because there isn't anything wrong with her, it was an outside factor.\n\nIt's really painful for me, as she's a close friend from many years. So the other day she was in my house while the kid was in the daycare. She had a breakdown. Started crying, saying she doesn't know what to do anymore. Then this is when I may have been the asshole:\n\nI said she tried her best, but maybe it was time to think of more difficult possibilities. To think if there wasn't anyone with whom the kid could stay while she took care of herself, because she needed to. She looked at me quite shocked and asked \"Are you saying that I should rehome my son? Like he's a fucking dog?\" \n\nI said no, don't take it that way, I was only saying that maybe it would be better for everyone, including him, that he stays with someone who could deal with him in some ways you can't. \n\nShe yelled at me saying that she couldn't believe I could even suggest such a thing and how heartless I could be. I tried to apologize but she stormed out and hasn't talked to me ever since. Some of our friends are saying that I was an ass for suggesting that for a mother, while a few other say that she needed to hear it even if it was hard. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Since most are saying I should help her, I do! I usually help her with errands such as groceries, pharmacy, picking/dropping her or the kid, and house chores. The boy spends most of his day on a daycare. I did NOT suggest she gives him up to adoption, only that she lets him stay with some relative or on a sleep-in school while she recuperates.", "created_utc": 1677522572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11diygi/aita_for_suggesting_my_friend_rehomes_her_kid/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe there\u2019s an organization that offers a summer camp for high needs kids? You could help your friend out by researching options like that.", "My uncle went through something similar. He was fostering his wife\u2019s neices and nephews and one boy, a bit older than her son, took a crowbar to his back window. They had gotten into it in the garage, his punishment was to help sweep or squeegee or something and he picked it up and started swinging it at my uncle and ended up taking out the back window of his car. He lives in a therapy home currently because it\u2019s the best situation for him, he\u2019s able to get 24/7 help from people who are trained to manage stuff like this.", "NTA but this is a tough one. Your friend seems to get physically ill from being exhausted constantly. I don't think you are an AH for the suggestion. \nGiving away your child because you can't care for them properly is one of the hardest decisions one could make but here it seems like it will be needed eventually.\nShe tries everything to raise her son and give him the help he needs but it's destroying her.\nSo what if her health gets worse and she can't take care of him anymore. It's also in the kids best interest that his mom is fit enough to care for him.\n\nYou did not suggest for her to just abonden her child. You said she should find a temporary solution so she can rest and get better.", "INFO:\n\nDoes the kid have serious mental, developmental, or behavioral illnesses of any kind?\n\nUnless you know for a fact that he has issues so serious that he would require specialized care and that either he is in danger with a parent who can't handle his needs or that the mom is in danger because of his behavior, then yeah, suggesting she rehome her kid like he's a poorly trained dog makes you an asshole. If he does have those kind of serious issues, then it's still an incredibly difficult conversation and you'd need to be a very close friend with lots of experience with her and her child and history discussing it to make that suggestion, and would have to do so incredibly tactfully.", "NTA, though maybe more tact could have helped you clearly are coming from the right place. Unfortunately she just wasn't able/willing to hear the good advice. There's lots of social messaging about failing as a mother if you don't sacrifice yourself for your kid she's probably really immersed in.\n\nMaybe help her reach out to social/welfare support? Maybe the state has some kind of other options that aren't sending the kid elsewhere but still more help than you can provide?", "NTA, as my wife and I \"help\" care for her niece and nephew because my BIL is a steaming bag of crap and doesn't take care of his kids (and the mom is a junkie criminal). So it's normal for family to HELP. You might have added some context and suggesting that SHE move WITH HER SON closer to her family where she would have emotional and financial support (one would hope). \n\nI didn't read it as you suggesting she get rid of her kid but she plainly is drowning in the situation she is in and trying to do it alone and hoping daycare raises him right is not improving matters.", "YTA. \n\n>\"Are you saying that I should rehome my son? Like he's a fucking dog?\" \n\nAt this point you should have apologized for bringing it up, and it was stupid of you to suggest it. Instead, you decided to try and justify yourself.\n\nYou earned every bit of this.", "NAH\n\nYou tried to help but it obviously came across as very bad. \n\nI see it from your side, the effect a seriously sick or mentally underdeveloped child can have on their parents are terrible to watch, no matter how much they love them. \n\nIs it possible that the child has a diagnosis, like autism? It is a wild guess, a doctor needs to conclude that!\n\nBut if that is the case, your friend can get help with theraphy, how to schedul the day for the child, special schools and so on. I believe this is what you were trying to convey?\n\nBut I think you should apologize and not approche the subject again right now. Your friend might not be ready to accept if their child is special needs.", "NTA. You didn't suggest she re-home her kid.\n\nYou friend can't pour from an empty cup. She can't give him the parenting he needs if she's worn so thin she can't care for herself. A temporary stay with a family member while she gets her own health under control is the best solution for everyone.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t suggesting giving the kid up for adoption or anything. Your friend said the word \u201crehome\u201d. \n\nYour friend is exhausted, physically and mentally. Everything she has, goes towards her kid who seems to have some behavioral issues. If she doesn\u2019t get help, she will burnout. Burnout will affect the care she\u2019s able give her son.", "NTA \n\nThis really seems to be a communication mix up. Your intentions were good, the phrasing perhaps could've used some work. Taking a break is good for all parents, getting community involved for support is crucial.", "NTA. In the US, we call that respite care. It\u2019s usually a social service that a family can access through a Medicaid waiver program. There are also nonprofit groups who offer respite care. In our local special needs group, we have a pool of caregivers who will watch another family\u2019s kid for a few hours etc.\n\nHopefully, she can get plugged into some groups or services that will help her.", "I find this post hilarious \ud83d\ude06 like OP gets credit for saying what we all sometimes think, like some kids you just think no way \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f haha but in reality it\u2019s not the dine thing to suggest it you\u2019re supposed to just blow smoke up their arses", "NAH.  It's not surprising that you hurt your friend's feelings, but you meant well.  You were insensitive, probably not well enough informed about what resources are available and what she's already using, but not an asshole. Maybe she's been hearing \"give him up\" comments from her parents or other people in her life, and she thought you were piling on.  Or maybe because she knows you don't have any kids, much less single-parenting a special-needs kid, and that means she rushed to a conclusion that you did not understand the depth of her commitment to her kid.  \n\nYou probably have damaged her trust - she won't share her pain with you again for a while, maybe ever.  Apologize - probably in an email, so she doesn't feel put upon to respond - and don't press for any response.  Keep texting her when you think of her, keep sending things for her son on his birthday or at other suitable intervals, maybe look for opportunities to spend time together in a group or to spend time with her and her son.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what resources for parents are available where you live.  And maybe your friend is too angry with you now to even listen to a more helpful approach from you.  \n\nIf I were in your shoes watching a friend suffer, first I would pay attention to her stories about how she's already using the supports that she knows about.  Nothing is more frustrating than having an outsider say \"have you tried X\" when of course she's been trying X, or in fact she's found out that her son is not eligible for X.  But I would be wondering about things like \"respite care\" (that's a kind of service that can take a child or a senior adult for a few days or a week while the primary caregiver gets a break or has surgery themselves or whatever).  If you meant to ask about some kind of temporary support like this and your friend thought you were saying she should relinquish guardianship of her son permanently, that's an unfortunate miscommunication!  I would also be wondering whether there is any inpatient care or therapeutic-boarding-school situation suitable for her son's needs - sometimes there are situations where this kind of placement can help the kid learn some self-regulation without the use of cruel methods.", "nah, it's obvious you genuinely meant that with the best intentions- her and her child are struggling immensely, but you worded it bad and came off wrong, if that makes sense. it's perfectly reasonable for her to be hurt as well", "NTA, but I suspect you could have put it across in a better way. I have a feeling she might have heard from someone else that she should give the child up, which is why that's what she went to when you made your suggestion, even though it wasn't what you meant. \n\nYou're getting quite a lot of harsh comments... I think your heart is totally in the right place and you just want to help your friend and their son. I hope they can find a solution, because it sounds like her well is almost dry, and I don't know what will happen when she has nothing left to give.", "Unless you're offering to help or she asked you for help, you do not suggest a parent get rid of their child!\n\nYTA", "NAH. You didn't suggest 'rehoming' or giving him away.  You suggested what the US  calls 'respite care '. It's basically a way for people caring for a sick or disabled family member to get a break.  That's what she needs. The problem is that there is a lot of guilt involved.  You basically have to admit that you can't handle something and it doesn't feel great.  \n\nYour friend does sound like she needs help. Once she calms down you should help her look for social resources in your area that would help. \n\nShe also needs the father to step in and help.  Caregiver stress is real and it sounds like she has that.", "NTA. If anything, she could get some rest by dropping him off at dads for a month or so. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. You didn\u2019t suggest she re-home her son. If she\u2019s anxious and worn down, she definitely needs help. A temporary stay with a family member sounds justified while she gets healthy again. It didn\u2019t sound to me like you were telling her to relinquish her parental rights.", "YTA\n\nBut let me, instead of raging, offer some actual insight. \n\nIm a parent of a 7 yr old kiddo who has ADHD, and ODD. If you dont know what ODD is, go look it up. And let me tell you, this day to day crap is frickin' hard. Thankfully I finally last year found the right healthcare, and have been actively dealing with my PPD. (PPD doesnt have a 'time limit' for how long someone can suffer its chaos). \n\nInstead of offering anything proactive, you went to a very 'cut throat' soloution. Until your a parent you wont get the feeling, and thats fine. But, you seem to have inserted your own inner feelings about the kiddo, in your talk to her. \n\nIts very obvious you dont like this kid. To each their own. I personally, love mine but dont like most other kids. In your world, it would be beneficial to you AND your friend if kiddo wasnt in the mix. And your mind can think that, because you dont have the attachment. \n\nBut you dont get to insert these kinds of feelings into a soloution for your friend. What is easy for you would be world shattering for her. \n\nAnd as a parent who myself had some big feels about being a parent. I wish someone had come to me about mental health for both the kiddo and the parents, waaay before I even had the kiddo. Ive been literally loosing clumps of hair for years until last year, when I FINALLY got some insight from a child pshycologist, and some other people who's profrssion it is to give tools to the parents AND the kids, so they can thrive. Instead of bashing their heads into the wall. \n\nYour friend sounds like she really needs some help. And frankly, instead of finding ways to ACTUALLY solve her issues here, you figured, \"it'd just be easier if she cut the problem off.\" \ud83d\ude44 THATS the issue here. And thats not being a good friend. I feel for this woman, I wish I could take her for coffee.\n\nI hope this better explains some perspective.", "NAH. While it wasn\u2019t a comment you shouldn\u2019t have made (in this context it\u2019s definitely not appropriate to suggest to a mother that she essentially abandon her child), I kind of get where you\u2019re coming from, especially since you\u2019re young and (I assume?) childless. I know it sucks seeing a friend struggling like yours is. But again, the comment wasn\u2019t appropriate and it doesn\u2019t sound like it was realistic either.", "Some kids get stuck in \"the terrible twos\" for a very long time... my stepson was like this, and we learned later that he has severe ADHD. Sometimes, a kid behaves poorly and they don't even know why, so it's just as frustrating for them as it is for you. But with proper mental health care, appropriate discipline/consequences, and perseverance, it does get better. My stepson is older now, and while there's still a bit to work on, he has improved greatly and is doing well in school and with friendships.\n\nI recommend reading the books \"Parenting with Love and Logic\" by Foster Cline AND \"The Explosive Child\" by Ross Greene. Those helped us tremendously.", "YTA. Your friend needs support, not someone telling her to give away her child.", "[deleted]", "YTA - Yeah you missed the mark on that one OP. Even if your intentions were good, did you actually expect a mother to just give up their 5 y/o because it's been tough? \n\nI think it would be smart to give her some space and distance for awhile.", "YTA. You out right wanted to separate a mother and child, told the mother she was a bad mother and more. This was not helpful.", "NTA. Anyone saying otherwise needs to get their heads checked. She should send her son to someone who can care for him for awhile so she can focus on regaining her health so she can look after him properly.", "YTA - Because you casually dropped a suggestion that cut to the core of her identity and self-worth.

Are you freaking serious? Is this real? Like, he's a kid, not a rental. WTF are you even saying? Lots of kids go though difficult periods, and their parents, you know, KEEP THEM.

You responded by suggesting that she ship off her kid for \"someone who could deal with him in some ways you can't.\" You basically agreed that she was failing and someone else who is not his mother could probably do a better job. You suggested for a mother to give up on her child. I guarantee that that is why she rightfully yelled at you.
