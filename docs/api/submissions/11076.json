The kid is, to say the least, difficult. She tries therapy, daycare, lots of educational methods but he's wild, cries a lot, destroys stuff, yells with her, anyway you get the picture. \n\nThe dad pays pension but isn't active in their lives and she doesn't have many family members nearby, so she's pretty much alone most of the time to deal with this. Poor thing is destroyed. Whenever we hang out it's clear from her physical appearance that she isn't very healthy and she is always tired and anxious. She takes meds but her doctor said that unfortunately there isn't much to do because there isn't anything wrong with her, it was an outside factor.\n\nIt's really painful for me, as she's a close friend from many years. So the other day she was in my house while the kid was in the daycare. She had a breakdown. Started crying, saying she doesn't know what to do anymore. Then this is when I may have been the asshole:\n\nI said she tried her best, but maybe it was time to think of more difficult possibilities. To think if there wasn't anyone with whom the kid could stay while she took care of herself, because she needed to. She looked at me quite shocked and asked \"Are you saying that I should rehome my son? Like he's a fucking dog?\" \n\nI said no, don't take it that way, I was only saying that maybe it would be better for everyone, including him, that he stays with someone who could deal with him in some ways you can't. \n\nShe yelled at me saying that she couldn't believe I could even suggest such a thing and how heartless I could be. I tried to apologize but she stormed out and hasn't talked to me ever since. Some of our friends are saying that I was an ass for suggesting that for a mother, while a few other say that she needed to hear it even if it was hard. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Since most are saying I should help her, I do! I usually help her with errands such as groceries, pharmacy, picking/dropping her or the kid, and house chores. The boy spends most of his day on a daycare. I did NOT suggest she gives him up to adoption, only that she lets him stay with some relative or on a sleep-in school while she recuperates.", "created_utc": 1677522572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11diygi/aita_for_suggesting_my_friend_rehomes_her_kid/", "score": 763, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe there\u2019s an organization that offers a summer camp for high needs kids? You could help your friend out by researching options like that.", "My uncle went through something similar. He was fostering his wife\u2019s neices and nephews and one boy, a bit older than her son, took a crowbar to his back window. They had gotten into it in the garage, his punishment was to help sweep or squeegee or something and he picked it up and started swinging it at my uncle and ended up taking out the back window of his car. He lives in a therapy home currently because it\u2019s the best situation for him, he\u2019s able to get 24/7 help from people who are trained to manage stuff like this.", "NTA but this is a tough one. Your friend seems to get physically ill from being exhausted constantly. I don't think you are an AH for the suggestion. \nGiving away your child because you can't care for them properly is one of the hardest decisions one could make but here it seems like it will be needed eventually.\nShe tries everything to raise her son and give him the help he needs but it's destroying her.\nSo what if her health gets worse and she can't take care of him anymore. It's also in the kids best interest that his mom is fit enough to care for him.\n\nYou did not suggest for her to just abonden her child. You said she should find a temporary solution so she can rest and get better.", "INFO:\n\nDoes the kid have serious mental, developmental, or behavioral illnesses of any kind?\n\nUnless you know for a fact that he has issues so serious that he would require specialized care and that either he is in danger with a parent who can't handle his needs or that the mom is in danger because of his behavior, then yeah, suggesting she rehome her kid like he's a poorly trained dog makes you an asshole. If he does have those kind of serious issues, then it's still an incredibly difficult conversation and you'd need to be a very close friend with lots of experience with her and her child and history discussing it to make that suggestion, and would have to do so incredibly tactfully.", "NTA, though maybe more tact could have helped you clearly are coming from the right place. Unfortunately she just wasn't able/willing to hear the good advice. There's lots of social messaging about failing as a mother if you don't sacrifice yourself for your kid she's probably really immersed in.\n\nMaybe help her reach out to social/welfare support? Maybe the state has some kind of other options that aren't sending the kid elsewhere but still more help than you can provide?", "NTA, as my wife and I \"help\" care for her niece and nephew because my BIL is a steaming bag of crap and doesn't take care of his kids (and the mom is a junkie criminal). So it's normal for family to HELP. You might have added some context and suggesting that SHE move WITH HER SON closer to her family where she would have emotional and financial support (one would hope). \n\nI didn't read it as you suggesting she get rid of her kid but she plainly is drowning in the situation she is in and trying to do it alone and hoping daycare raises him right is not improving matters.", "YTA. \n\n>\"Are you saying that I should rehome my son? Like he's a fucking dog?\" \n\nAt this point you should have apologized for bringing it up, and it was stupid of you to suggest it. Instead, you decided to try and justify yourself.\n\nYou earned every bit of this.", "NAH\n\nYou tried to help but it obviously came across as very bad. \n\nI see it from your side, the effect a seriously sick or mentally underdeveloped child can have on their parents are terrible to watch, no matter how much they love them. \n\nIs it possible that the child has a diagnosis, like autism? It is a wild guess, a doctor needs to conclude that!\n\nBut if that is the case, your friend can get help with theraphy, how to schedul the day for the child, special schools and so on. I believe this is what you were trying to convey?\n\nBut I think you should apologize and not approche the subject again right now. Your friend might not be ready to accept if their child is special needs.", "NTA. You didn't suggest she re-home her kid.\n\nYou friend can't pour from an empty cup. She can't give him the parenting he needs if she's worn so thin she can't care for herself. A temporary stay with a family member while she gets her own health under control is the best solution for everyone.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t suggesting giving the kid up for adoption or anything. Your friend said the word \u201crehome\u201d. \n\nYour friend is exhausted, physically and mentally. Everything she has, goes towards her kid who seems to have some behavioral issues. If she doesn\u2019t get help, she will burnout. Burnout will affect the care she\u2019s able give her son.", "NTA \n\nThis really seems to be a communication mix up. Your intentions were good, the phrasing perhaps could've used some work. Taking a break is good for all parents, getting community involved for support is crucial.", "NTA. In the US, we call that respite care. It\u2019s usually a social service that a family can access through a Medicaid waiver program. There are also nonprofit groups who offer respite care. In our local special needs group, we have a pool of caregivers who will watch another family\u2019s kid for a few hours etc.\n\nHopefully, she can get plugged into some groups or services that will help her.", "I find this post hilarious \ud83d\ude06 like OP gets credit for saying what we all sometimes think, like some kids you just think no way \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f haha but in reality it\u2019s not the dine thing to suggest it you\u2019re supposed to just blow smoke up their arses", "NAH.  It's not surprising that you hurt your friend's feelings, but you meant well.  You were insensitive, probably not well enough informed about what resources are available and what she's already using, but not an asshole. Maybe she's been hearing \"give him up\" comments from her parents or other people in her life, and she thought you were piling on.  Or maybe because she knows you don't have any kids, much less single-parenting a special-needs kid, and that means she rushed to a conclusion that you did not understand the depth of her commitment to her kid.  \n\nYou probably have damaged her trust - she won't share her pain with you again for a while, maybe ever.  Apologize - probably in an email, so she doesn't feel put upon to respond - and don't press for any response.  Keep texting her when you think of her, keep sending things for her son on his birthday or at other suitable intervals, maybe look for opportunities to spend time together in a group or to spend time with her and her son.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what resources for parents are available where you live.  And maybe your friend is too angry with you now to even listen to a more helpful approach from you.  \n\nIf I were in your shoes watching a friend suffer, first I would pay attention to her stories about how she's already using the supports that she knows about.  Nothing is more frustrating than having an outsider say \"have you tried X\" when of course she's been trying X, or in fact she's found out that her son is not eligible for X.  But I would be wondering about things like \"respite care\" (that's a kind of service that can take a child or a senior adult for a few days or a week while the primary caregiver gets a break or has surgery themselves or whatever).  If you meant to ask about some kind of temporary support like this and your friend thought you were saying she should relinquish guardianship of her son permanently, that's an unfortunate miscommunication!  I would also be wondering whether there is any inpatient care or therapeutic-boarding-school situation suitable for her son's needs - sometimes there are situations where this kind of placement can help the kid learn some self-regulation without the use of cruel methods.", "nah, it's obvious you genuinely meant that with the best intentions- her and her child are struggling immensely, but you worded it bad and came off wrong, if that makes sense. it's perfectly reasonable for her to be hurt as well", "NTA, but I suspect you could have put it across in a better way. I have a feeling she might have heard from someone else that she should give the child up, which is why that's what she went to when you made your suggestion, even though it wasn't what you meant. \n\nYou're getting quite a lot of harsh comments... I think your heart is totally in the right place and you just want to help your friend and their son. I hope they can find a solution, because it sounds like her well is almost dry, and I don't know what will happen when she has nothing left to give.", "Unless you're offering to help or she asked you for help, you do not suggest a parent get rid of their child!\n\nYTA", "NAH. You didn't suggest 'rehoming' or giving him away.  You suggested what the US  calls 'respite care '. It's basically a way for people caring for a sick or disabled family member to get a break.  That's what she needs. The problem is that there is a lot of guilt involved.  You basically have to admit that you can't handle something and it doesn't feel great.  \n\nYour friend does sound like she needs help. Once she calms down you should help her look for social resources in your area that would help. \n\nShe also needs the father to step in and help.  Caregiver stress is real and it sounds like she has that.", "NTA. If anything, she could get some rest by dropping him off at dads for a month or so. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. You didn\u2019t suggest she re-home her son. If she\u2019s anxious and worn down, she definitely needs help. A temporary stay with a family member sounds justified while she gets healthy again. It didn\u2019t sound to me like you were telling her to relinquish her parental rights.", "YTA\n\nBut let me, instead of raging, offer some actual insight. \n\nIm a parent of a 7 yr old kiddo who has ADHD, and ODD. If you dont know what ODD is, go look it up. And let me tell you, this day to day crap is frickin' hard. Thankfully I finally last year found the right healthcare, and have been actively dealing with my PPD. (PPD doesnt have a 'time limit' for how long someone can suffer its chaos). \n\nInstead of offering anything proactive, you went to a very 'cut throat' soloution. Until your a parent you wont get the feeling, and thats fine. But, you seem to have inserted your own inner feelings about the kiddo, in your talk to her. \n\nIts very obvious you dont like this kid. To each their own. I personally, love mine but dont like most other kids. In your world, it would be beneficial to you AND your friend if kiddo wasnt in the mix. And your mind can think that, because you dont have the attachment. \n\nBut you dont get to insert these kinds of feelings into a soloution for your friend. What is easy for you would be world shattering for her. \n\nAnd as a parent who myself had some big feels about being a parent. I wish someone had come to me about mental health for both the kiddo and the parents, waaay before I even had the kiddo. Ive been literally loosing clumps of hair for years until last year, when I FINALLY got some insight from a child pshycologist, and some other people who's profrssion it is to give tools to the parents AND the kids, so they can thrive. Instead of bashing their heads into the wall. \n\nYour friend sounds like she really needs some help. And frankly, instead of finding ways to ACTUALLY solve her issues here, you figured, \"it'd just be easier if she cut the problem off.\" \ud83d\ude44 THATS the issue here. And thats not being a good friend. I feel for this woman, I wish I could take her for coffee.\n\nI hope this better explains some perspective.", "NAH. While it wasn\u2019t a comment you shouldn\u2019t have made (in this context it\u2019s definitely not appropriate to suggest to a mother that she essentially abandon her child), I kind of get where you\u2019re coming from, especially since you\u2019re young and (I assume?) childless. I know it sucks seeing a friend struggling like yours is. But again, the comment wasn\u2019t appropriate and it doesn\u2019t sound like it was realistic either.", "Some kids get stuck in \"the terrible twos\" for a very long time... my stepson was like this, and we learned later that he has severe ADHD. Sometimes, a kid behaves poorly and they don't even know why, so it's just as frustrating for them as it is for you. But with proper mental health care, appropriate discipline/consequences, and perseverance, it does get better. My stepson is older now, and while there's still a bit to work on, he has improved greatly and is doing well in school and with friendships.\n\nI recommend reading the books \"Parenting with Love and Logic\" by Foster Cline AND \"The Explosive Child\" by Ross Greene. Those helped us tremendously.", "YTA. Your friend needs support, not someone telling her to give away her child.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "YTA. You out right wanted to separate a mother and child, told the mother she was a bad mother and more. This was not helpful.", "NTA. Anyone saying otherwise needs to get their heads checked. She should send her son to someone who can care for him for awhile so she can focus on regaining her health so she can look after him properly.", "YTA - Because you casually dropped a suggestion that cut to the core of her identity and self-worth.

You suggested for a mother to give up on her child. I guarantee that that is why she rightfully yelled at you.

It seems like a misunderstanding. \n\nThe thing is, it's hard to raise children even without all the factors she's dealing with.

What you suggested was \"you need a break to get better\" and she jumped to the conclusion that you wanted her to get rid of her son. I don't know where she got that idea. People send their kids to stay with grandparents and family all the time, particularly if there's some kind of problem. This is a problem. She needs to time to heal and also, to figure out long term solutions to this. \n\nIf she's having such a difficult time, that's not good. It's not about her own abilities or worth as a mother; her body and mind cannot keep going like this, and it will affect the quality of care she can provide. Accepting that doesn't make her a bad mom or mean she doesn't love her kid. Besides, if she gets sicker, which, considering the stress she's under and the fact that she has a 5 yo in daycare, is likely, what the hell is she going to do? \n\nAnd if she doesn't have it handled, if she can't properly take care of her kid, wouldn't she rather she figure out a way to make sure they're in a safe place she knows and has control over rather than let it get bad enough that someone else (like the government) interferes? Because if this continues and gets worse, she risks having her child taken away forcibly. \n\nNAH \n\nThe rest of this is addressed to all of the other commenters who said YTA that can't see the nuance, and jump to the whole \"oh you aren't a parent you don't know what it's like\" line, which, sure. She isn't. \n\nNeither am I. But what I am is someone who was a kid and had parents. Parents who had a lot going on, lots of hardships, lots of stress, and who didn't have it all handled. Parents who loved me so, so much, and still made mistakes that affected me deeply. I saw my parents sacrifice everything for me, and be miserable, and then, not because they were bad parents who didn't love me, but because they were human beings with their own trauma that they never addressed, never worked on, make mistakes in their stressed and frustrated states. \n\nSeparating parents and children may be hard, and ideally wouldn't have to happen, but that's not how the world works. And parents who recognize that they cannot provide the care needed for their children who make sure that their children get that care, even if it means loss of the child, temporarily or permanently, not only love their children but prioritize their children's wellbeing and needs over their own desires. Not everybody has the opportunity to do that, but those who do and choose to do so are better parents than those who instead have the kids stay with them, and act like even if the quality of care is subpar and it's bad for everyone, the fact that they're suffering makes them a better parent or that it somehow makes up for all the mistakes they make caused by that suffering. It doesn't. I can acknowledge all the reasons behind why my parents did and said the things they did. I can acknowledge that they loved me and wanted the best for me and that our circumstances weren't their fault. But also, they weren't my fault. They made the decision to have me. They made the decision to not take breaks, and to not seek therapy, and to make things unnecessarily more stressful for themselves to fit into their image of being a good parent. And then they resented me for it, and they had less patience and less understanding and were less able to watch what they said and did. It made them worse parents, because they had this idea that it has to be difficult. They looked down on parents who went on date nights and left kids with babysitters, or who went on trips without their kids sometimes, or who sent their kids to camp, and acted like their way was better. It wasn't, because their marriage was awful, they were always stressed, they never did their own thing or had lives of their own outside of me, they never indulged in anything for themselves, and we all suffered the consequences. \n\nThose who said that Yta likely didn't fully think things through. They think that good parents, especially mothers, should struggle for their kids to the point that the mere suggestion for this woman to focus on herself for a bit and have the kid stay with someone who isn't, as OP mentioned somewhere, literally randomly falling asleep when they hang out, who can give the attention and care this kid deserves while his mom works on getting to a place where she isn't feeling so overwhelmed, was met with such utter disgust and contempt. This seems misguided to me, and I think it stems from the same sort of mentality that motivated my parents. Wanting to be seen as or fit into some ideal of a \"good parent\" and doing the best for the child are not the same, and the priority should not be a parent's desire to do what they think they is the 'correct' way to care for a child, but the child themself. Insisting on pushing through the pain, and continuing to struggle instead of considering other options doesn't make you a good parent, it makes you unable to adequately care for your kid, affects them negatively in the long term, and leads to increased risk of risk. And to be clear, I'm not referring to cases where there are no other options, where parents don't have access to the resources and/or help they need. I'm talking about making that choice. Being too proud, too stubborn, thinking that it has to be a certain way. A parent's main concern should be their child's wellbeing. In the situation OP described, she should be considering everything because, like I said, this is not sustainable. If it's not a possible solution, or if it isn't the best solution available, then she can dismiss it. But if it is possible and the option that works best for them, she should do it. Ultimately, it would have less long-term damage for the kid to stay with relatives until she gets things figured out than it would if, for example, his mom got into a crash because she fell asleep at the wheel.", "NTA\n\nShe needs help, and it sounds like you guys have a system in place where the kid will be looked after while she is able to focus on herself.", "Aw mate, this is so tricky.

I\u2019m sure myself and others could help make recommendations and do some research into financially accessible programs? \n\n From your description, I\u2019m not sure how eligible the kid would be for certain respite services, without a diagnosis. But off the top of my head I reckon a big brother / little brother or grandparent program, could be a start, just giving her a few extra hours and him some some love and care from sources external to his usual providers.", "You did a spectacularly bad  job of explaining. Both your first and your later comments make it seem as if you are suggesting she gives him up, you should have made it clear you were talking about reaching put to a professional to get a temporary break for her. I am willing to believe you meant well, but you expressed it so badly you made it worse for her.", "\"To think if there wasn't anyone with whom the kid could stay while she took care of herself, because she needed to.\"\n\nSeems pretty obvious to me that OP means respite care, i.e. something temporary.", "Inaccurate. In some cases it helps both the child and the parents, or mostly the child to be away from his parent if their health are at risk. Read OP comments in the post. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Maybe you could keep the kid for couple of days while your friend recharges", "YTA. You should have offered to help her more instead.  You said you already do help her, but apparently she needs more help than she is getting.  Have you considered babysitting the kid for an afternoon to give her a break?", "NTA--Maybe she should take him to a mental health professional to have him evaluated. It sounds like he maybe has something going on that is frustrating like hearing deficiency or maybe eyesight issues. It could be something simple or complicated.\n\nRespite care is a nice thought but she didn't take that suggestion so well.\n\nSupport her when you can and be there for her to vent, that is all you can really do.", "NTA and honestly if she can\u2019t listen to reason there\u2019s not much you can do that yourself in the situation.", "Are there parenting classes offered close by?\n\nOr a therapist who specializes in families and family dynamics?", "NTA. The only reason for her to fly off the handle like that is that she's thinking/feeling like she needs a break but feels guilty about it. You hit a nerve that she's been poking. Make it clear you meant respite care and not taking him to the pound and offer some decent respite solutions.", "YTA, you don't 'rehome' children and saying that is worse than just about anything else you could have said!", "NTA", "Nta for suggesting she take a break its just not what she wanted to hear", "Has your friend's son seen a psychiatrist or diagnostician who can properly evaluate her son for a correct diagnosis?  Just because the child is in therapy doesn't mean it's the proper intervention for him.   For example, my older son has Autism, ADHD, and (now) mild sensory issues.  It's taken a variety of interventions over the years to get him the help he needed.  \n\nBefore my son was properly diagnosed, he was a lot like your friend's son and it was horribly stressful and I wasn't even a single mom. There were times when he was little that he would hurt me or himself because he was so out of control.  I feel really bad for your friend. Some of the therapies we have done that have helped in different ways are therapeutic preschool where the entire staff was trained in proper restraint techniques, behavior plan, play therapy, occupational therapy, and ADHD medicine.  \n\nHe's 16 and is doing better than I ever expected. He has friends now and even a girlfriend, which we thought would never happen. We are currently in the midst of his college search and teaching him how to drive. He sees a private psychologist, Autism Support Specialist, and psychiatrist.  He has a support plan at his public high school and takes ADHD medicine and Prozac.", "NTA. she feels guilty", "I am also parenting a child with ADHD and ODD and agree with everything you said. It's such a lonely road that people can't seem to understand unless they have personally traveled it. Wishing all the best for you and your child.", "Agreeing with all of this! I have a friend with four kids, three of whom are on the spectrum.  Her husband passed away a couple years ago, and though they're not itty bitty, her kids are all still at home.  Despite all the help we all tried to give, she just couldn't keep up with all of her kids' needs.  She felt like a terrible parent for considering it at first, but we were finally able to convince her that respite care would truly be *better* for *everyone*.  The two youngest went to a \"camp\" for four months, she got a chance to breathe and to grieve. Now that everyone is back home again, they're all doing better than any of us could have hoped.  Two thumbs up for respite care!", "Still NTA if she believes it would be better for both mom and son.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting so many downvotes. I read it the same way.", "Has he seen specialists (psychiatrist, developmental pediatrician) or just a regular pediatrician?", "Well it\u2019s not an awful thing to say, I don\u2019t think a 12 year old would have the maturity to suggest a good way to help their friend", "Having the child spend some time with relatives is not a big deal.  Lots of kids will spend summers with a relative. Your friend should ask a relative to take the child for a summer so she can get a break. Not that uncommon.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t suggest \u201crehoming\u201d her kid at all. But I can understand why she may have taken it that way and was upset. I can\u2019t see if you said what country you\u2019re in, but mentioning that might be helpful for people to point you and your friend towards services that could help her care for her child.", "She just needed emotional support, not a solution.", "NTA. Plenty of people do exactly what you suggested.", "NTA my aunt has a child like this. Around the same age too. She\u2019s looking at care facilities for him. Children with most disabilities (behavioral, physical, and mental) can be capable of being successful adults. Sometimes it takes outside help. There are options out there. It sounds like behavioral problems and care facilities can be extremely capable of helping these kids to get to where they need to be", "NTA\n\nWhat you're talking about is respite care.  There's nothing wrong with it, and loads of people use it.", "YTA - if what you are actually recommending is respite care, cool, do a better job at explaining that. If you are saying to give up her kid, keep your unwanted opinions to yourself", "Hearing Everyone Talk About Respite Makes Me Soooo Happy I Live In The UK I Grew Up in foster care and we actively campaigned and were successful in respite being a banned work for anyone wondering why if you google the meaning of respite it means relief of burden that is why instead of respite we now call it short stay. It is a major trigger word for a lot of people who grew up in the care system.", "I think it's possible she's projecting some guilt about her own difficult feelings for the situation, it's easier to externalise people suggesting it rather than admit you're actually considering it.", "YTA, if her son is a regular at daycare, his behavioral issues cannot be beyond the scope of what is acceptable.", "NTA, but I can understand her reaction given how difficult, scary, and frustrating things must be. She must be exhausted. You saw this and offered exactly what she needed. NTA, not at all.", "NAH. It sounds like she misunderstood your suggestion for respite care with a suggestion to permanently give up her son which is easy to do if she is exhausted. Has her child been diagnosed with any behavioural issues? If he has she might be eligible for support programs including respite care, depending on what country you are in. If not, maybe look at getting together with friends and family and paying for a kids camp to get her a break.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Sometimes having a sleep-in school can work well so the parent has a break plus extra energy for the times they are with the kid. \n\nGood luck to you all.", "probably going to be downvoted if anyone actually reads this, but i think the way you must have said it makes YTA. you needed to edit your post to further clarify for the rest of us what you meant so i\u2019m wondering if the same happened in your conversation. furthermore, maybe she was just looking to vent and not for suggestions that could potentially make her feel like a failure (she\u2019s not, but a lot of moms can get mom guilt). I think you may have overstepped.", "This YES!", "A side question; did the husband happen to be much older than your friend? Asking because my DNA scientist niece mentioned that the likelihood of having an autistic child increases dramatically with 'old' sperm.", "YES! He was 15 years older! That's absolutely fascinating.  There's so many questions to resolve as more and more is discovered about DNA. Your niece is in an awesome field!!"]}
