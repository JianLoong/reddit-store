Starting to smell like the beginnings of financial abuse.\n\nNo, scratch that, a long distance relationship where you've only even met him a few times and he wants 4K? This is a total scam. Dump immediately. Do not pay anything for any reason. Do not move in with him as you have now stated in a comment you will be doing soon - that will put you on his turf, away from the support you currently have where you live.", "OP, you\u2019re being scammed.", "NTA. Heck no. You\u2019re starting your adult life while dating someone that\u2019s likely significantly older. Day camp costs are his responsibility, not yours.  This is only a 6 month relationship and long distance, no less - all to say, this feels like you\u2019re being used when there should be funds out of his 100K salary to pay for HIS child\u2019s summer camp.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re 21 dating a guy with a 12 year old kid? How old is the guy? And he expects you to pay for his kid? Run.\n\nLike run. Maybe get a restraining order.", "NTA.  Why do you think this is a good idea?  His kid, his responsibility.", "NTA. How old is your boyfriend? If he really earns more but still can't afford the 4K camp (which is a TON!!!) he should try to look into a cheaper camp or other summer activities for his child. Not ask his girlfriend to pay for him. His child has a biological mother he can ask to participate.", "NTA. this sounds like a scam. don't do it.", " Run! Something is not right - nta", "NTA. DO NOT PAY. You are likely much younger than this man, he earns a lot more than you, and you have only been together a short while. Do not offer money. It will not stop at a summer camp, and this man will come after your money again and again.", "NTA but uh, OP-\n\nI mean this with love, as someone who\u2019s dated many older people and wishes I\u2019d figured it out earlier-\n\nWhy does an older dude with a kid want to date a 21 year old? Why don\u2019t women his age want him? Why are you already more financially responsible than him?\n\nWhy have you only been dating long distance for 6 months but he\u2019s already talking about his debt and has you worrying about his finances? \n\nIt is *really, really, really* early for you to be involved in each other\u2019s finances in any way. I already wouldn\u2019t date someone that much younger than me, but if I did, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be expecting a 21 year old to take on huge adult responsibilities like someone else\u2019s kids\u2019 costs. I would not even be mentioning that shit without a strong caveat of \u201cyou\u2019re 21, this is not your problem, please let me pay for your dinner\u201d.\n\nWhy is he struggling financially to the point of having debt despite making $100k, which is more than 82% of Americans make (and double what you make)? Why is he trying to send his kid to an incredibly expensive summer camp if he can\u2019t afford it? I\u2019m sure the kid wouldn\u2019t mind staying home playing video games all summer. Why is he dating when he should be working overtime to get his finances right for his kid?\n\nYou\u2019re 21, have your whole life ahead of you, etc etc. You should be having fun with your money, traveling, saving your money for buying yourself a house in the future, etc. You haven\u2019t even left your parents\u2019 house yet, do you wanna jump directly into being responsible for someone else\u2019s kid? Your 20s are when you\u2019re supposed to go play. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re financially stable, go have some fun experiences in the world.\n\nDo not take ownership of this man\u2019s problems. You did not decide to have a child, you do not need to take on responsibility for someone else\u2019s. You\u2019re clearly very responsible and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve saved money, but you should save that money for the right person (you) and the right situation. Don\u2019t go adopting every baby bird with a broken wing that you find on the sidewalk.\n\nWhere is the child\u2019s mother? Is she contributing? You\u2019ve never met this child and you are essentially a stranger for all intents and purposes, but you\u2019re worried about his $4k summer camp? Are even you sure this man is even single?\n\nIt\u2019s very sweet of you to care about the kid, but something smells really weird about the situation, OP. Save up rent for a year so you can go live in a new city and not work for a while. Get you a hot dude in his 20s with as much financial bandwidth as you, go lay on a beach in the Caribbean somewhere, and save the childcare spending for your own future kids. You\u2019re 100% allowed to not be financially responsible for some older rich dude\u2019s son\u2019s expensive optional summer camp.", "NTA. And this guy is probably way too old for you if you\u2019re only 21 and he has a 12 year old. Say no, you are not a parent and if you weren\u2019t with him he\u2019d have to figure out how to pay himself. This is a huge red flag, I\u2019d really think about this if I were you.", "NTA. Do not give his any money.", "NTA Hell no! Is he taking the piss?", "NTA.  OP shouldn't even consider paying for the kid's summer camp.  OP is just dating the guy and has only met the kid once.  If the bf asks OP to pay, she should see this for the red flag it is - an older man trying to take advantage of a younger woman.", "Absolutely not!!!! NTA. It would be foolish to contribute to that kids trip. Y\u2019all have been together for 6 months. You owe them not a cent.", "NTA, DO NOT PAY!  He is trying to mooch off of you!  RUN FAR FAR AWAY", "NTA and are you sure this \"boyfriend\" isn't just scamming you?", "NTA\n\nHon, please take off your rose-coloured glasses and seriously re-evaluate your relationship.\n\nYou've obviously already been discussing finances, since you and he are both aware of each other's salaries, debts and savings. Has he asked for gifts, small financial help, pushed for deets on savings you have as well as your parents finances?\n\nThis seriously sounds like you're in a relationship scam, and you need to protect yourself from a financial predator.", "YWBTA if you DID help honey", "NTA this would be a hell no.", "OP needs to look into \u201cromance scams\u201d. I\u2019d bet anything this guy is telling other women the same sob story about his non-existent son needing money for camp.", "Not just unmarried, but together for just 6 mths in a long distance relationship!", "I think he is trying to scam her out of money", "And how old is this man?", "Op is 21 and her long distance boyfriend has a 12 year old kid that she wants to spend $4k on even though the dad makes twice as much as her.\n\nThose are some weird numbers.", "Probably even older than we think since she deliberately omitted his age.", "Well not neccessarily.. if OPs boyfriend was 16 then he now is 28. 7 years is not that bad of an age gap. Butttt I do agree that it sounds like there is an age gap.", "How many weeks is that?", "Only 9 years older then the kid.. that's like the gap between my oldest sister and me.", "> 7 years is not that bad of an age gap\n\nI disagree. I\u2019d both were 10-20 years older it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But OP is only 21. 7 years is a huge gap for a 21-year-old.", "Sure, ASUME he fathered a child at 15 and became a father at 16, cause that is the norm? How about 25-26 and is 15 years older then barely legal OP?", "I'm very lucky that my husband helps out - my son & DIL are both working full-time jobs, but with a 6 year old & 6 month old, they're really stretched.  I'm happy to help out with this camp because it will really benefit the kid since it's at a beautiful park in their city, plus they've got a ton of STEM activities for the kids!", "It runs from when school lets out to a week before school starts again, so it's 10 weeks.  Cost is 205/week + 10/day for lunch & snacks.  Kids can bring their own food of course, so that would cut the cost a bit.", "A manipulator and con artist doesn't have to ask directly. They can make the victim think it was their idea to fork over 4K in cash to someone who makes 2x what they do.", "This sounds like an extremely bad idea.\n\nGoing from \"met him a few times\" straight to \"I will be moving in with him soon\" is really dicey and a great set up for abuse, including financial abuse. He hasn't even finished trapping you in his house and he's already trying to get at your money. He'll be wanting your non-liquid assets next. You are a gold mine. \n\nGranted, I'm being very cynical, but such relationship show up in this sub on a regular basis and nothing about what you told us suggests anything different.", "Please don't move in with him"]}
