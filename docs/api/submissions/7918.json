The fact that you are only 10 years older than their kid is a bit worrying. Makes it seem even weirder that anyone would imply you have any sort of financial responsibility for the kid.", "NTA.\n\nHis kid attends this expensive camp every year. The expense is something he and the kid's mom should have budgeted for. If they can't afford to pay, the kid shouldn't go.\n\nYou shouldn't even be asked to help. If you are, that would be a big red flag that your BF is \"dating\" you for access to your bank account.\n\nThe fact that someone ten (maybe more) years older than you is hinting about you helping to financially support his 12yo child is pretty creepy.\n\nNext up, he might try to turn you into a live-in nanny.", "If you are going to date someone much older than you, who has a kid, definitely don't get sucked into paying for either him or his child's expenses.  He earns twice what you do, why should you subsidize him? NTA.", "NTA.  You been together LONG DISTANCE  for only six months and he's asking for $4k!?  This sounds more like a scam than a relationship.", "Nope. Not your kid, and you don't even have a relationship with the kid. AND it's been 6 months since you've been dating.", "NTA. You\u2019ve only been together 6 months, his finances are not your problem, 4k is a lot of money, it\u2019s between him and his kids mother to work out how to pay for it.", "Nta\n\nIt\u2019s not your kid and this relationship isn\u2019t at a point where these type of requests are really appropriate", "Nta. This could be a scam. If it isn\u2019t. You\u2019re probably closer in age to the 12 year old than you are to your bf.

Do not consider splitting finances on any level with someone that you don\u2019t share a home with. If he expects your help, he is deeply in the wrong and showing a big red flag. When you\u2019ve only been dating 6 months long distance, it\u2019s extra concerning.\n\nAlso, consider how responsible he is with his finances. Financial responsibility matters more than a good salary.", "NTA, and you may want to consider what you see in this relationship. Either dude is much older than you, or he had his kid as a preteen, which on its own is not a problem. BUT, he hasn't figured himself out enough to act his age or look after his own responsibilities.

His parenting dilemmas aren't yours to solve. Where is the child's mother in all of this?", "NTA.

Nope", "NTA of course, but the post will be deleted as there is no actual conflict here (rule number 7 I believe?)", "You're NOT the AH.  You paying anything is absolutely absurd.  You don't live together, you're not married, and not to be mean, but this kid is nothing to you other than your BFs kid", "NTA. So many red flags here. How old is your bf?", "NTA. Do not move forward in this relationship with this man! The fact that he\u2019s old enough to have a 12 year old is red flag one. The second red flag is that if he\u2019s making over 100 K a year and asking his girlfriend of only six months to help contribute to his kid, God only knows what\u2019s going to happen to your money if you guys ever move in together or get married. Run as fast as you can from this train wreck.", "What the heck? How could you be an asshole for not supporting another woman's child, whose father you've only been seeing for only 6 months? Even if you'd met the kid many times, they are still not your responsibility.\n\nObviously NAH. Not sure why this even has to be asked.", "NTA.  And talk to a good investment advisor.  Having money parked in savings is probably destroying your buying power at the rate of 20% or 30% per year.

Don\u2019t walk, run.", "NAH\n\nIt would be completely unreasonable to expect you to pay anything in that situation.
