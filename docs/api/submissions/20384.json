He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife\u2019s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily. \n\nWe have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn\u2019t sadly. \n\nWe were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room. \n\nI need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn\u2019t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.\n \n\n\nEdit: Well he called his mom, let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn\u2019t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren\u2019t needed. \n\nTalked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concern \n\nFor people saying we didn\u2019t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with.\n\nThis will be my last update, had a conversation with my son about everything. Mom and him will have a conversation when she is calms down. His friends are not a state over, they are about two down at this point and going to Mexico. They are probably will get to the boarder tonight, they were suppose to be going to California . He had his passport and everything ready. This is a fucking mess.\n\nI haven\u2019t informed my wife yet and will wait until she is calmer. I\u2019ll leave off with I hope none of you ever have to deal with a situation like this and please remember your parents are human", "created_utc": 1687525933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gy8ir/aita_for_having_my_son_miss_his_graduating_road/", "score": 13440, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this kind of sudden and critical situation you didn't have time to explore any other options (although taking your younger children with you would have been the next best thing) and you also paid him for babysitting.  Your son is also not an AH for being really upset and angry about missing his trip. However, he's only got himself to blame for not going out to meet them for the rest of it after you offered to get him there.", "He\u2019s a teenager. They don\u2019t always think rationally. He\u2019s disappointed that he missed an opportunity he was looking forward to. Which he no doubt believes it was his one & only opportunity to ever have fun. Sadly, he can\u2019t get out of his own way to figure out how to put this back together. He has 2 options .... continue to pout or let you help him get what he wants. Not much more you can do. \n\nIt\u2019s not about his lack of empathy. Grandpa\u2019s fine so what could have happened is not really an issue now. It didn\u2019t happen & now y\u2019all need to figure out how to move forward.\n\nNAH\n\neta \u2014 adults would struggle with the same feelings if they had plans for a fun trip & a family emergency came up. Once that emergency is over. Most people would be disappointed they missed out on their plans. Your son is upset with his situation. It seems like a normal reaction to me. Don\u2019t make it personal.\n\neta more \u2014 based on your edit... you\u2019re trying real hard to make your son the ah here. I\u2019m guessing to absolve yourself in this situation but .... that\u2019s not cool in my book. Don\u2019t throw your own kids under the bus. If your son is that selfish you should ask yourself why or how he got there. Kids don\u2019t raise themselves. I\u2019m a little disappointed that y\u2019all chose to point your fingers at the 18 yr old that had no control over any of this & didn\u2019t have the best reaction. Everyone is this story deserves a little grace. It appears that is not your goal.", "INFO: If your son had already left for the trip, what would you have done with your two kids?", "NTA- it was a legitimate family emergency and unavoidable. Sending on the trip two days late would be the best options and he needs to get over it.", "What's there a reason you didn't take the younger kids with you? They're at ages where you don't have to keep your eye on them every single second, it shouldn't have been that much of a bother.", "NTA and the people who constantly answer \"he's not your children's parents\" are exhausting and out touch with reality. He wasn't parenting, he was looking after them during an emergency! When something like that happens you are supposed to help your family. You are not an island, your interests and needs are not the only ones that count. OP and wife weren't on vacation, they had to drop everything to go spend time in a hospital where son's grandfather almost died. Needing to assist someone in such conditions trumps a stupid trip. Watching your brothers for that one time because your family is in a horrible situation trumps a trip. The level of selfishness in some comments is absurd.\n\nIf we need to reason like that, then OP and wife shouldn't pay for the trip given that son is an adult. They shouldn't drive him anywhere given that he's an adult. He shouldn't live with them given that he's an adult. Do you see how stupid all this sounds? \n\nIt was an emergency, he had to help. OP even offered to take him to the trip so that he wouldn't lose all of it but son refused. He could still go and spend 12 days with his friends, instead he chose to throw a fit and skip two whole weeks of vacation because he had to stay home for 2 days. Son can be upset, but he chose to be stupid about this. He should have accepted the lift.", "NAH. You had an emergency, it wasn't unreasonable to ask your son to help. But your son is missing out on his trip, he's allowed to be disappointed and angry about what he's already missed. I bet he spent those 2 days getting messages from his friends about how much fun they're having, how much he's missing out on, maybe even how dumb it is that he had to stay home. I know you intended to get him back on the trip, but I understand him feeling like the whole trip is ruined. Once he calms down you need to have a plan *ready* to get him to his friends. More \"I can buy your plane tickets for the town they're in tomorrow and your hotel reservation for tonight so you can meet them there, or do you have a different preference\" than \"okay, what do you want me to do here?\"\n\nYou've said it yourself: you don't know what you would have done with your younger kids if your son was already gone. You need to figure this out, have a plan other than your son, because he will come to understand your choice, but he is never going to forget the time he missed out on, at least some of, his trip. I'm sure he has plans now, he isn't going to be available to you the way he has been, and you need to be prepared for him to flat out refuse to help if he's busy.", "Nta its shitty yes, but there are 12 days left?????  Can he not fly to where they are and go from there.", "NAH - IDK I'm really shocked at everyone saying bring the 7 and 11 year old. He missed 2 days of a 12 day trip for a life threatening emergency. He can be disappointed but I would have done the same.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry about what your family is going through wishing your in laws a speedy recovery. This was definitely a family emergency and through your comments you even clarified that there was no other option other than having your son babysit. Your son has every right to be upset, but I\u2019m surprised by how he\u2019s much more upset about missing a trip with his friends than seeing his mother almost lose her parents. I would have said N A H but your son seems very entitled in this entire situation and keeps putting himself and his situation over an actual family emergency, even after you offered him a solution by letting him go to the rest of the trip.", "Honestly YTA \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t take your kids, it\u2019s their grandparents who were in critical condition after all. \n\nAnd what would have happened if he already left?", "NTA. Emergencies happen. He could have still had 12 days on the trip. Not to mention has he shown any concern for\nHis grandparents? You had multiple back up plans that failed. Not your fault.", "NTA.  Your son is a member of a FAMILY.  Shit happens.  Priorities sometimes change - sometimes HAVE to change.  Good for you, and him, for stepping up when necessary.  If kids/teens don't learn, that sometimes they can be disappointed when things don't go their way, you get grown ass men who don't think they need to step up when family emergencies happen.  What?  Wife's mother is in hospital?  Oh well, Daddy's got a golf tournament.  Kids can go visit sick granny. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA in this situation, unfortunately you haven't raised your son well. An 18 year old isn't a toddler and should be mature enough to handle missing a a bit of fun if there is a family emergency.\n\nAt 18 he may be to old for you to influence his character now. Hopefully you can do a better job with the younger kids.", "I might be the only one thinking it was only 2 days he missed out of 14 and it was for a family emergency\u2026\ud83e\udd14\n\nOn the other had if he had already left, you would have had no choice but to take them with you or farm one of the out to a friend etc.  \n\nNTA", "NTA I can\u2019t believe people think that an 18 yr olds vacation is more important than taking care of family in an emergency situation. I understand why the 18 yr old is upset, he is only 18 & at that age you think yr friends are more important than family, but they aren\u2019t.", "NTA, these responses are insane. It was a family emergency where two people almost DIED. I can't believe he was still in a mental or emotional state to want to go on the trip anyway after that (if grandpa had died, would he have chosen to miss the funeral for this trip? Because it's sounding like it), and beyond that, he could still have made all but two days of the trip and is now just throwing a tantrum with no purpose other than to make everyone feel even worse than they already do. The lack of understanding and compassion he is showing here is incredible.", "NTA.\n\nUnder the circumstances there were no good options and I don't think you did anything wrong. Those people suggesting you could have taken the kids with, dropped your traumatised wife at the hospital to deal with things on her own, and been the babysitter - I doubt they've ever been in this type of situation - or even have the empathy to imagine themselves in this situation. It's very much a *me me me* mindset which is pretty disturbing.", "NTA. He missed fun plans. Boo hoo. Grandma and grandpa are in the HOSPITAL!!! \n\nIt was a legit emergency. You even offered to fly him out. 2 days less of a 2 week vacation is hardly much. He\u2019s being entitled. No one is entitled to fun, when family is in the hospital like this. If they\u2019d passed, would he have opted to go on his friend vacay instead of going to the funeral? He\u2019s seriously prioritizing his friends over family. \n\nThat said, don\u2019t punish him too much. He\u2019s still a teenager. He\u2019ll get over himself. Heck, I had a family member who tried to make me babysit so they could go shopping when it was MY mom who was hospitalized. They were a full adult.", "WTF is up with all the YTA votes? It sounds like they did the best they could with a horrible situation. They looked for other sitters even including neighbors but no one was available. Taking the 2 kids with them would have made a horribly stressful situation even worse especially since the where at the hospital for around 48 hours. Mom was in no shape to help look after them considering she is probably thinking her dad might be dying. The 18 year old was the last option and was payed for it as well as them saying they will try to make it up to him. \n\nNAH - They did there best and the 18 year old is a loud to be upset but this was an emergency situation.", "People really?   Grand's were 4 hours away and it was EMERGENT!  You can pack up two kids and adults to be 8 hours away as an emergency?  Who are you people?  She had to get there..  no way shes driving 4 hours alone not knowing whos going to be alive or dead at that point.  \n\nAnd you absolve an 18 year old for having any empathy for his mom, dad and grands?  Pouting over a pleasure trip that could probably be done later?  This is how life goes -   \n\nNTA - in an emergency you react as best you can with what you have.  You did.   18 is no longer a kid - he needs to broaden his little world.", "If you\u2019re trying to get him there now then NTA. Shit happens and I get not wanting to drag your other kids to the hospital, but it also sucks missing your graduation trip (or part of it). His anger may also be due to fear about the grandparents and he\u2019s not expressing that. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s scary and upsetting for you as well. It sucks for everyone involved but you\u2019re doing the best you can. He will look back and understand one day. I hope your family heals from this accident and emotional trauma. Hopefully you can get him to his trip too", "NTA. You were dealing with a life or death situation. You should do something to show that you recognize he had to give up something major he wanted to look after his family. He's understandably mad and overreacting like teenagers do. It's a shitty situation all around but you did the right thing. Hope your family is well", "NTA,  don't listen to the folks saying you could have taken the kids with you to the hospital waiting room, that would have been stressful for the kids, your wife & yourself. Your father in law was critical, which am sure was very difficult for you wife, she didn't need the added stress of the them being there or the distraction that would have caused.  Your son needs to realize that things can happen to alter our plans, you did offer a compromise, he decided it to turn it down.", "NTA, He is young and you harmed his plans in his eyes. He will feel different at 30 when he sees how life gets in the way. It was a family emergency...He could have finished up the trip...Well taken of children are selfish and don't have the benefit of sacrifice kids with not so good families have...It is a back handed compliment. So apologize, and let him fester. He may end up going.", "NTA.\n\nAll these people saying take the kids with you- absolutely unhinged. A trauma hospital is NOT a place for children and it's really inappropriate to bring them for potentially days. Many hospitals still have no children visiting guidelines, and even if there isn't a policy, taking care of children's needs (which include not witnessing trauma firsthand) takes you away from the necessary things you needed to do like meet with doctors, make difficult medical decisions, etc. \n\nFamily emergencies come before individual plans. That's too bad, but it's realistic. \n\nAnd your son's refusal to join now is... Something. Give it a day, check in, offer to drive him to meet the friends, and forgive everybody including yourself.", "NTA.. y\u2019all people have no sense of family.. y\u2019all are selfish people..", "NAH", "I'm going to say NAH. I understand why you and your wife did what yall did but I also understand why your son felt such crushing disappointment. \n\nWhat I dont understand is why your son is refusing to now go on his trip even after talking to his mom.  Is it guilt over how he reacted or did his friends find someone else to replace him on the trip so there is no longer room for him?  You need to sit your son down and  find out.  Give him room to talk it out then yall figure out together what can be done to make this right for him", "NTA Your kid was always going to have feelings about this. You only asked due to the emergency and you tried to make it up to him. Try again.", "NTA - He should help the family in this occasion. You even try to make amends and he was being selfish. \nHope he came bake to his senses after the photos your wife send him. \nHope your IL recovery well to.", "NTA \n\nIt was an impossible situation, and your son would've lost only 2/3 days of a while vacation. He cared more about a vacation than his grandparents almost dying, I think he really needs to grow up.", "NTA, it sounds like you exhausted all possible options.\n\nThat however doesn't really matter now. Get him out of that room and drive him to meet his friends.\n\nHe's sulking now, but he'll regret not going when you offered it to him.\n\nDo what you can to get that boy to go on the rest of this road trip.", "NAH (assuming there was a valid reason you couldn't take the younger kids with you). Emergencies happen. Contingency plans fall through. If you can insist that since you paid for this trip, he's bloody going to get off his butt and Go for as much time as you can get him there.... I think he will ultimately salvage some fun out of it.  If you let him sulk in his room and miss out entirely, he will hold that grudge in his head until he is old and grey.\n\nRuining the first part of his trip is unfortunate, but his refusal to even try to salvage part of it is... well... immature. Which he is. Be a parent and force him to go on the remainder of the trip. It's for his own good.", "NAH. I've been basically that teen though. Family emergency with mom's medical stuff. Sometimes it sucks. Sometimes all you can do is ask a teen (senior) to solo halfway across a country to get back to class or drive across a state they don't know to help. Other days it's drive a parent to the ER. Or watch a younger sibling (I wasn't paid a few years back but it was a soft I was basically garenteed some pizza from a pizza shop. Even now I wouldn't take payment in terms of cash but help with meals/entertainment) during a tough moment. It's hard when medical shit goes down.\n\nBut as someone who also graduated during COVID, I legit was angry. I had to grieve my senior events. Imagine being promised this big grand thing, and then it's taken away. It's not about the days left, it'll be what you missed. And my parents did everything they could to give me a senior finish. Driveway prom was cute and fun (got to dance with my whole family, father/daughter slow song, snacks I choose, a fancy dinner that was picked up, my cute dress, mom got hers out), graduation meal at a restaurant with everyone important just like I had wanted and my choice. But I also lost out on prom with my friends. I lost those final days with them. \n\nYour teen totally can be upset. But make it right. I know you offered, but help a bit more than just finances. Ask where he would love extra time. Make it happen. Or better yet, when the trip is over have all his friends be treated to some fun activity together.", "NTA- This is a case of things conspiring to derail plans. It's a good lesson to your son, that some things have to take priority over others. A life threatening accident certainly takes precident over a road trip. One MUST be dealt with, while the other is completely optional. Honestly, your son faied this test of his character. He is acting like a spoiled, entitled little brat. Ask him if he'd be happier getting ready to attend his grandparents funeral. I'm sure you regret he couldn't go, but you were between a rock and a hard spot. You couldn't send your wife off on her own to deal with this tragedy and stay home to deal with the other kids. That's a betrayal of your commitment to help and support your wife. Your son needs to have a check up from the neck up; his value system is 'way the hell out of whack.", "NAH - it's tragic when something horrible like that happens to anyone's family members. This isn't something that was foreseen. You had no way of knowing this was going to happen. \n\nThere's been a lot of people ruling one way or another here but I don't think anyone here is at fault. Your son had every right to be upset about not going on the graduation trip. It had been scheduled in advance and it was unreasonable to expect all the other kids to delay the trip. The fact that he could've gone later and met up with them isn't the same as going with them.\n\nYou also had every right to expect that in a family tragedy that your son should step up and not go so he could watch your two younger kids. Often unexpected things like this happen and in the absence of any other solution, someone invariably has to make a sacrifice.\n\nThat being said, you could have easily taken your two kids with you. By your own admission, you were gone only two days and your wife stayed while you came back home. Your two kids were 12 and 7, not newborns. They could easily have gone with you and you could have kept an eye on your kids in the waiting room while your wife stayed with her father.\n\nThere are way too many people here who feign shock that anyone would suggest taking two young children into the ER or a waiting room because kids just can't handle that kind of thing and would be subject to possible trauma. Get the fuck outta here with that nonsense. \n\nIt's called life people. I grew up in a military family and spent many a day in the ER with my parents waiting at the base hospital. I saw all kinds of shit (victims of car accidents, helicopter accidents, gun range incidents, tank accidents, etc.), but that didn't adversely affect my psyche in anyway. Kids are far more robust than our current soft-skinned society act like they really are. People need to grow the fuck up. Exposure to real life causes maturity. Lack of any exposure to real life and what goes on results in thin skinned snowflakes.\n\nAnyway, neither you nor your son are in the wrong. He's angry right now, but he'll get over it. He'll come to understand that you made the best decision you could given the circumstances. You'll make it up to him in some form or fashion and it'll all work out for the best.\n\nBest of luck to you both.", "I won\u2019t say YTA, because you likely weren\u2019t thinking clearly is this emergency. However, the younger children could have gone with you and your wife and stayed at her parents house while the two of you were at the hospital. At 11 a child is old enough to feed and look after a younger sibling and make a phone call if help is needed. You made a decision that was based on what was easiest for everyone but your oldest child. That\u2019s going to be a bitter pill for your oldest child for a while. Your wife sending the photos of her father\u2019s injuries to that child was way out of line. Instead of hearing what he was saying, she dumped double-barreled guilt on him.", "NAH family emergencies take precedence. He\u2019s allowed to be upset that he missed his trip, but responsibility is what it is. and especially if you offered to help him link w his friends for the rest of the road trip", "NAH, families emergencies happen... and thats it...\nOP tried lots of options that didn't work... and when he came back he tried to fix or at least diminished the trip situation.\n\nHe paid his son for his services and tried to take him to his friend so they could continue to trip.\n\nOn the other hand I understand the sons frustration we all have them regardless of age.\n\nAnd if people prefer to go this way, son ins under his roof and also parents where paying for the trip, it does not change thr NTA, but for some people it can add.\n\nEverything sound fair for me so... NAH", "NTA.  Emergencies happen at inconvenient times.  Sometimes you have to do the unfun thing to help family.  He can still do the rest of his trip if he wants.  Don\u2019t get angry back.  He\u2019s a disappointed teen and they don\u2019t really cope well.  Offer him some options and let him know if they are time limited.  Like you can go drive to meet them, but you need to leave by 2PM or there is a flight at 4 PM.  Which does he want to do?", "Im probably going to get downvoted to hell, but I'm going to say nta. Honestly, all your children  should have gone to the hospital to make sure their grandparents were ok. I'm glad to hear they're alright.", "NTA. I feel bad he missed his trip but he could've just gone and met them a few days later. I feel like you could've taken them with you, but I also understand keeping two young kids in a waiting room isn't realistic. And clearly your wife needed you to be there with her. Sometimes you need to do things for your family, especially in an emergency.", "NTA. I seriously do not understand the y t a votes, and I'm not sure if it's a combination of people too young to actually be in these situations or people who are projecting person issues.\n\nYou've tried every option possible to find alternative care for your children. When you have to ask the neighbors, you know you're in a bottom of the barrel desperate situation. The comments saying you should have had emergency plans are so tone deaf. You did go through your emergency plans. Further, from your comments, it was not feasible to bring your kids. Your wife was in no place to take care of anyone, and you were busy handling hospital papers ans updates. For the comment saying to leave your children at your IL's place, like what? So your kids are still unsupervised but in another location? Or comments saying to leave them in a hospital waiting room? It's not the hospital's responsibility to babysit kids, and it doesn't sound like either you or your wife could have supervised them. The only other option, it sounds like, was to either leave them in the hospital room with the mangled bodies of their grandparents or leave them at home for 2 days with their brother. \n\nThe fact that your son had 12 days out of a 14 day trip cements the NTA to me. You offered to pay for him to meet up with his friends so he could enjoy the rest of his trip. He decided that no, he would rather be mad that he missed 2 days and would miss the remaining 12 days as spite. That's on him. \n\nAs an aside, if I had heard my grandparents were in a fatal accident I would not be able to go on any trip. Your comment indicates that he is close to his grandparents, so it's weird to me that he glosses over their accident to be upset about a trip. For those of you saying that this is the biggest trip ever and its a once in a lifetime - the kid is 18, I'm pretty sure he'll have more memorable trips that don't require him to feel like his grandparents' accident was an inconvenience.", "I mean, NTA imo and shit was taken from me constantly as a kid. In this situation, he's being a brat. People are in the hospital. I know he's only 18 but he can learn now or later that emergencies happen and plans change. Twelve days is plenty, and he got paid. I don't get it. It sounds like a tantrum to me.", "NTA. It was an incredibly serious family emergency. You tried multiple options to find someone to stay with your younger children, and you needed to be there. You paid him, and even were going to drive him cross country to meet up with his friends, he would only have missed 2 days of a 14 day trip. \n\nSometimes life bites us in the arse.\n\n*Edited because I went on an unnecessarily long rant about vaguely related personal experiences.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, just my opinion, hospitals are very scary places for kids to be ESPECIALLY when they\u2019re young enough to kinda understand what\u2019s going on (we\u2019re here because grandpa might not survive and we\u2019re just gunna be in the waiting room for 2 days to see what happens) there\u2019s no use traumatizing kids in medical settings so if THEY ever have to go to the hospital their memory of it isn\u2019t \u201cgrandpa came here and never left, am I gunna never leave here too?\u201d (Ik grandpa pulled through but he might not have, they didn\u2019t know)", "YTA. You knew he had a trip and I see no reason from your story why you couldn't have brought the younger kids with you aside from it being an emotionally charged situation and them being inconvenient. They are your responsibility ultimately, not his. What would you have done if he had already left on his trip and it had happened? Would you have demanded he come back from his trip to watch your other kids?\n\nIt's also not your job to police how he feels about his grandparents. People are allowed to feel however they feel about people, especially family that they don't get to choose. I was never particularly close with my mom's parents. We showed up together at family events, but we never had a one on one relationship. Do I love them? Sure. But there's a distance between us that has never been bridged. They knew very little about me as a person.\n\nEdit: I would also like to say that from the more recent edit, his mother should never have made him look at pictures of his injured grandparents to make him feel bad about being upset.", "tough situation all around and glad to hear grandparents pulled thru.  however your son is allowed to be in his feelings and i bet u he does care his grandparents almost passed but he is upset and you probably dont see its mixed in together.  just let him work it out in his mind all of it and im sure he will get over it.  when emergencys like that happen we all tend to have high emotions", "NTA.\n\nIt was a family emergency. Your son needs a reality check.", "NTA at all. You have your priorities straight.

It\u2019s a no-win situation. 18 year old me would have been super upset but as an older adult now I\u2019d skip the trip in a heartbeat. I think to your point, try to make it up to him and it\u2019ll blow over.", "NTA.  Sometimes you just have to do for family and set aside everything else.  You got squeezed even with plans, it happens. \n\nYour son\u2019s being an AH. He could catch up on the trip and show some concern for his GF.", "NTA.  It's an emergency and then you offered a reasonable solution to catch him on at the rest of the trip that would likely be costly but shows you were trying if you would pay for a cab or airfare.  \n\nFor those saying you should have an emergency plan, it sounds like they did expecting friends or a babysitter to help out and they tried those first. The only other family was their son who was old enough to handle this and should be expected in emergencies.

Cut yourself some slack.", "This one is really hard. I get why your son is throwing fit. The road trip with his friends is a once-in-a-lifetime event, especially having grown up in the height of COVID, and having so much of his life utterly rearranged because of that. You also offered to pay for him to catch up to his friends. You even paid him for watching the younger two kids.\n\nBut this was truly an emergency situation. And almost everyone is forgetting that yes, grandpa almost died, but grandma was ALSO in the car accident. OP didn't say how badly she was injured, but we can assume, she probably didn't walk away unscathed.\n\nOverall, I'm going with NTA.

Your son was unreasonable and could have just taken the opportunity to still go for the trip and be grateful you arranged it, he was being petty.", "I'm gonna give a tentative NTA. Yeah it super sucks to miss the beginning of a graduation road trip but it ALSO super sucks to have family get in an awful accident. The timing was shitty but you had an emergency and asked a young adult to step up. There's no reason he couldn't have rejoined them by flight two days later like you attempted. I wanted to say NAH, but even after your son calmed down it sounds like he was still being petty about it.", "NTA. Anyone who thinks he should have brought the kids has obviously never been on ICU. That shit is harrowing and a real eye opener to how dire life can get.", "I can\u2019t come up with a logical answer for this in my mind because I can put myself in both sets of shoes so I guess I have to go with NAH. Parents tried to find another solution but also when you are stressed, most people don\u2019t think clearly and I doubt they were thinking of all options such as taking the kids with them.

This is how you get written out of grans inheritance.", "NTA. The number of people saying you are is astounding. The accident involved his mother\u2019s parents\u2014his grandparents. Disappointment is understandable but even at 18 I would have been more worried about my grandparents dying than a road trip.

Yet it seems that once it sunk in how awful this family catastrophe was, your son \"came to\".\n\nAnd I'm sorry he missed his trip.

This guy has 3 and they couldn't back up. \nOh well he should have stayed home with the kids. \nThen he'd have been an asshole to his wife who wanted him with her. \nHe tried everything and then his son wont accept that the trip is still 12 days long. So that makes the kid also an asshole. Yes it sucks but emergencies happen. I'm gonna say NAH because there's just no way round it. Sucks for the parents. Sucks for the son.

There seems to be deeper issues here than just missing a road trip.", "Wow, crazy opinions here, but not surprising from the teenagers here.\n\nNTA.

In the real world we take care of our families and don't always put ourselves first. The concept that you are an asshole for making your kid miss 2 days of a 2 week trip during a family emergency where people may literally have died is just baffling to me and really exemplifies how little real world experience people have. They would have been much bigger asshole for dragging two young children to sit in a hospital waiting room unsupervised for 2 days. Have you sat in a hospital? It is loud, chaotic and often scary. I wouldn't leave my kids in that environment unless absolutely necessary for an hour, never mind all day.\n\nIgnore the YTAs. Honestly. I don't care about the reddit voting system.

Tell him to think about it. Delays happen in life and he can still get to his friends and it means a lot that he helped out when an emergency came up. He deserves a load of appreciation and reinforcement that this is what it means to be family. A hard lesson, but it shapes them. \nGraduation is a scary transition as much as it's exciting and freeing. Now he can't transition out of his resentment.

Sometimes, situations like this require sacrifices.\n\nYour son is 18 and doesn't have the life experience yet to see it this way, though. He's going to feel angry and upset and I don't blame him for this, either.

I think having the opportunity to meet up with his friends will eventually entice him out once his thinking clears up again.\n\nIf a similar emergency comes up again, I would just bring your younger kids with you to the hospital.

He has many and he's a teen. He was scared too. It was an emergency. I'm sorry y'all had to go through this and I'm glad that they're okay.", "NTA. It was an unexpected serious situation and I'm sure the last thing you wanted to do was drag young kids along.

He's 18 and angsty, he doesnt understand complex emotional situations or empathy. So the tantrum is expected. \n\nUltimately it's a shitty situation, maybe should have taken the kids with you, maybe not. The eldest will get over it and can plan something else with his friends.

I was 18, my relationship with my grandma wasn't ideal, and I was devastated at the thought that I had to give up that chance and the rest of that trip for her. In retrospect though, I do wish I had gone. I think my dad needed support, and I felt like a terrible daughter for a long time following because I couldn't get out of my own head long enough to empathize with my dad having just lost a parent. It took me years to accept that I was still a child, and under that level of stress and confusion, I wasn't going to make the perfect decision. \n\nEverything about this situation sucks, but ultimately, each person reacted exactly as I would expect them to.", "I don't think this kid realizes how lucky he is to even have Grandparents to worry about at his age. I never even knew mine (both mom and dad sides) due to them passing away before I was born or when I was very young and had zero memory of.", "I honestly think a lot of the yta votes are from high school or about to be college age kids that don't understand how bad this situation was for everyone in it. NAH is the correct answer and it sucks you aren't top comment.", "What kind of person cares about a road trip more than their grandparents almost dying in a car accident.", "Yeah that was a classic teenager reaction, I don\u2019t hold it against him (cuz uh, he\u2019s a teenager) but he\u2019ll look back on that and cringe. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. \n\nHe lost two days of a two week trip, his dad is offering to get him out to where the trip is (!!) and he says no?  That part is officially on him. \n\nNow if I had reacted that way (can only speak for\nMyself) it would have been for some obscure embarrassing reason I didnt want to explain to my parents, like I had gotten it all set up that I would share the back seat with my crush and she would fall asleep with her head on my shoulder during the quiet overnight driving hours and she would discover she\u2019s madly in love with me, and now that dad messed up the seating arrangements by <checks notes> having the grandparents get into a serious accident, my love life is RUINED. FOREVER. \n\nNot saying that\u2019s what happened here, but if I personally had made a judgement call seemingly that petty and counterproductive to my own aims, there would have been some underlying (probably embarrassing, probably about a girl) reason for it.", "Agreed. Also sometimes teens (and even adults) cannot grasp the gravity of a situation, and sometimes they have a one track mind (I.e the last trip before college with his buddies).  I get it , I was a teen once. OP isn\u2019t really wrong either because it wasn\u2019t like he abandoned the younger siblings to go on a vacation. It\u2019s just a tough situation. \n\nNAH", "I agree with your take completely. \n\nIt\u2019s hard as a teenager to see past the moment and I understand why he\u2019s not acting at his best. It\u2019s super disappointing. But it sounds like OP did the best he could in such a short and hectic time. \n\nI\u2019ve had family emergencies get in the way of trips. I was supposed to go on an amazing, once in a lifetime trip where my fianc\u00e9 was going to propose to me. Family emergency with a relative in the hospital. And you\u2019re totally right. I, an adult, was so disappointed and down about it, but the suddenness of the family emergency was much more important. This is absolutely a lesson in how cruel life can be sometimes. There is no golden way out of it. \n\nSo all the people calling OP the AH for making their kid miss a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d trip are really confusing me. They paid for it. I\u2019m pretty sure they wanted their kid to have fun and enjoy graduation. \n\nThe only AH here is life.", "Doesn't matter using this made up situation the emergency occurred before the kid left and he missed a whopping 2 days of the 14 and was given the option to join up for the road trip this is a one off emergency situation", "If I were the kid, I'd drive right back in the middle of the trip to help family. My grandparents almost died. Wtf", "Right. Or what if they didn\u2019t have an 18 yo, just the two younger. And what if 18 yo was living across the country at college?  Requiring him to stay is pretty silly. The kids could have gone with the parents, OP could have minded them while his wife spent time at the hospital.", "Except the oldest didn't leave yet. And family emergency should be priority", "NTA. I don\u2019t get the Y T A posts. The kid\u2019s grandparents were in a serious accident and he still wanted to go on a trip? And what, celebrate as they potentially died? I don\u2019t understand the lack of compassion from him or people commenting here. In times of stress family comes together and he did his part by watching the kids so the parents could deal with the situation.", "As an older sibling, I can't imagine ditching my younger sibling during a family crisis. Plus the OP offered to make sure he gets to go on most of the trip.\n\nNTA", "People with the \"not my problem\" attitude. Hope it works out for them.", "The fact that the son is refusing to fly out to meet his friends makes me think either he has found out that his friends don\u2019t care enough about him to pick him up (which could be the real source of his frustration which he\u2019s taking out on his parents) or the trip they told their parents about isn\u2019t the trip they\u2019re really on and the son would have to tell his parents where his friends really are in order for them to get him a plane ticket.", "It would have been an awful opinion for everyone especially since I was running around through most of it and wasn\u2019t in the room for a good bit. Mom was having breakdowns and was not even fit to look after herself and grandpa and grandma were bad also.

Asking an older child to watch younger child during an emergency is not parentification. People have truly lost their minds.", "People think the slightest inconvenience to a teenager is a mortal sin for some reason.", "Right? I don\u2019t particularly like kids and wouldn\u2019t watch them for people on a regular basis.

Her parents were in a serious car accident (leaving her father in critical condition) and everyone's worried about poor precious's widdle feelings about a trip that he still could have attended and had only missed two days of.  Priorities, much?\n\nAbsolutely NTA, OP, but a lot of these comments seem to be left by those that are.", "My God. This is the worst take I've ever heard. His grandparents almost died and he's worried he missed two days of a two week trip? He was even PAID to watch his younger siblings in an emergency! He didn't already leave. And I would expect my son to come home from his trip to watch his siblings if he had already gone. Just like I would have if my GRANDPARENTS ALMOST DIED and the family needed me. The dad even focused on getting the son on the trip once the emergency was cleared and the entitled little so and so threw a tantrum because if he couldn't have all of it, he didn't want any of it. Way to cut your nose off to spite your face dude. This trip is also a privilege, not a right. So there's that.", "According to OP\u2019s account, he basically had to stay in the hospital for almost the whole 48 hours and was dealing with a bunch of doctors and paperwork. Where would the kids be in all this, in your mind? In a hospital\u2019s emergency room, with their grandparents mangled one room over and trauma victims being shuttled through. Have you even been hospitalized in an ER? It is nothing you would want to subject a kid to for 48 hours when alternatives exist.\n\nEdit to add: if grandfather was in the verge of death, it was very unlikely he was in a quiet hospital room, and more likely in the ICU. I don\u2019t even know that hospitals are OK with kid visitors being anywhere near the ICU. There\u2019s generally not great waiting rooms that are safe/cool for kids. Trauma patients and victims of violence are coming through all the time. My parents had to visit me in the ICU and it was traumatic enough for them to see all the shit around me, and they were in their 50s.", "I agree.

Dealing with kids with relatives in the hospital is the last thing I wanna do", "You want them to take their children into critical care in the hospital while everyone waits around to find out if the grandparent died?! Do you know how traumatic that would be for those children. In my 20s, I had to wait in a restaurant with my family members as we waited for the news of my grandfather dying from cancer bc we couldn't be in the room with him any longer. It was horrible. And you want an 11 and 7 year old to endure something similar so a teen won't have to miss 2 days of a 12 day road trip? Fukin' A! Where are your priorities!?\n\nThe kid is an asshole for throwing a hissyfit about missing 2 days, so now he's missing all 12. The dad tried to get him on the trip, and the kid doesn't want to go anymore bc not getting the 12 days \"ruins the whole thing.\" \n\nAlso, this is his grandparents, too. If he went right away, this kid would be on this road trip drinking and partying while his grandfather was fighting for his life.

They should take an 8 year old and an 11 year old to see a man who is critically injured to stay with them in hospital. You don't think that might be you know, a bit terrifying and traumatizing.", "Be honest, are you under 18? Are you a teenager? I cant imagine why else you'd vote this way.", "At the same token, if OP takes the 11 and 7 year old, shouldn't they also take the 18 year old? Since it's also the 18 year old's gpa who's in critical condition", "You're really going to drag an 11 and 7 yo to a hospital to see their critically, possibly dying grandparents, who probably look like a truck hit them? Oh, wait, that kind of did happen. I'm thinking the OP is NTA, but maybe you are. This man jumped through every hoop possible, to keep everyone happy. And the kid had TWELVE out of 14 days left, in which the Dad did his best to get him there. But no, this brat (and yes, I have had kids this age, and this kid was being a brat), didn't care about anyone but himself. This isn't one of those cases where the parents left a kid to raise his siblings. And if the kid had left, then yes, maybe they would have had no other choice. But bringing them and traumatizing them with the grandparents, and seeing the mother being a basket case was not the answer.", "Missing 2 days of a 2 weeks long trip that the parents are paying for cause your grandparents werein critical condition?

My parents would have taken turns with the kids- one stays at the hospital, the other stays with the kids and they switch off. In my case, it was because my older sister's appendix suddenly burst on vacation. My parents were obviously not doing great (it fully burst and she was initially misdiagnosed, so she was in a bad physical state by the time she got to surgery) and the rest of us were too young to get how bad the situation was. But you do what you gotta do, and whatever parent was with us at the time at least pretended to keep it together. Entertaining young kids in a hotel room isn't easy either, but possible.\n\nI was also in charge of younger siblings after my mom's car accident while she was in the hospital, so I've been kinda in son's situation.

This is what adults have to deal w all the time- doing the right thing in uncomfortable situations. \n\nAlso the fact that OP had to say that he has backup babysitters\u2026 it\u2019s not his fault. Lots of people don\u2019t babysit bc they don\u2019t like it, or also they\u2019re unqualified, have pets kids are allergic to, etc. You can\u2019t dump your kids with anyone over 18- lots of people don\u2019t have lots of babysitting options. \n\nAs a parent, I couldn\u2019t imagine having two younger kids crawling all over the hospital. It\u2019s also ridiculous to assume dad would stay at in laws with the younger sibs. What if mom needs support at the hospital? What if fil needs food or any other run, while the mom and grandma are in a meeting with the doctors? What if both women wanted dad to drive them bc they\u2019re both crying and emotional?\n\nI feel like a lot of people in this sub aren\u2019t parents and don\u2019t understand the nature of kids. Kids are so fickle, you could literally have the perfect environment (re: their snacks, their fave games) and they\u2019ll randomly freak out.

As a result, my parents have no idea when I started walking, or said my first words, or a lot of those milestones that happen. My baby book is half empty. There aren't even a lot of baby pictures of me. My brother is 2 years older, and they have all that stuff on him. Do I resent my parents for that? Fuck no, it's not their fault. Shit happens.

Your son is becoming an adult and he needs to understand that sometimes you have to step-up for others in these types of situations.\n\nHe  easily could have joined his friends, but instead decided to punish you by punishing himself.", "These were extenuating circumstances and you have the benefit of having an older child who is able to step in and help. People keep saying \"what if you only had younger kids\". Well, you don't. You have an 18 year old son who was just taught that family comes first, and sometimes family obligations are going to supersede previously scheduled fun plans. You are giving it so much thought so clearly this isn't something you do often, and you tried to not have to turn to him. This kid is not a third parent. This one time he was asked to step up at a really inconvenient time.

If anyone says the two younger kids should be \"big enough\" to cope with hanging around a hospital waiting room (if even allowed), then I counter that the 18 year old son was \"big enough\" to cope with stepping up and helping out in clearly an unavoidable but urgent situation, if not poorly timed.  \n\nIn summary, OP was trying to be supportive of his distraught wife, coordinate the logistics of getting wife and self to the hospital in another state, assist with the admin/paperwork for the hospitalized in-laws, and organize care for his two younger children.

Let me reframe this a bit from his perspective.\n\nHis grandparents are in an accident. That is scary. His parents are, understandably, focused on the grandparents. They leave him alone with his two younger siblings, who are presumably also scared and worried and feeling all sorts of emotions. It\u2019s likely there\u2019s a lot of unknowns for the tree children too, if they aren\u2019t getting updates. This only causes more confusing and complicated emotions to work through. As the oldest and the one in charge, your son is probably having to, to some extent, bury his fears and other emotions about the situation. In his mind, the trip may be fair game to be upset about because it isn\u2019t so death-focused. It\u2019s a place he can funnel the emotions he can\u2019t express properly. On top of not having his parents for support, all of his friends are away on this trip. So he feels alone, left behind, with no one to talk to or comfort him. No one to reassure him. And if his grandfather does die, will he be the one to have to break it to his siblings? Even if not, he will be the only one immediately there to comfort them- again, burying his own emotions. \n\nWhat you asked is more than you realize, I think. And I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t have done it. But it\u2019s important to recognize that he\u2019s having his own complicated emotions that he needs to work though and it may not look how you want it to. Your son is only human, after all. \n\nSometimes, what you are most outwardly upset about isn\u2019t what\u2019s bothering you the most. For me personally, when I\u2019m upset about something, I\u2019ll realize later on that it was never about the thing I thought I was upset about. It was about other things I was suppressing. Other things I didn\u2019t let myself feel. \n\nIt\u2019s far easier to put to words being upset about missing a trip with your friends than it is the complicated mix of fear, grief, and concern that comes with an accident like you describe. Especially if you are trying to bury those complicated emotions.", "NAH.\n\nHe's allowed to be upset that his trip was \"ruined.\" I also see why you didn't want to take two small children on an emergency trip where their grandfather might die.\n\nDamned if you do damned if you don't.", "Life is the asshole sometimes.", "Entitled millenia here - this is a family emergency and wow you guys are extremely  generous parents. \n\nTeens (especially) have big feelings to things so his reaction makes sense but damn they way you were willing to pay for a plane ticket to help him catch up and he said the whole thing was ruined... but it wasnt ruined already by the looming shadow of his grandparents almost dying?

His emotions were running high from graduation and the thought of his upcoming trip, and that doesn\u2019t just mean he was super happy. When you\u2019re in a state like that it amplifies every emotion, whether it be sadness or joy or frustration or anger. It warps the way your mind remembers things, and if you aren\u2019t careful what he\u2019ll retain from this is \u201cI had a whole trip planned out and my parents forced me to skip it at the last minute and yelled at me when I complained.\u201d That is not what happened, but it might be all he remembers in the future.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not taking this into account for my ruling but there is no way to make this up to him and it was extremely passive of you to assume you could. He\u2019s never going to graduate high school with these friends again. They\u2019re likely never all going to be in the same place again, and you don\u2019t mention any sort of itinerary but those first days may have been the parts he was looking forward to (I know my senior trip started with a festival and ended with a week at the beach and I was really only interested in the festival - if I had missed it I probably would have just skipped the rest of the trip).\n\nI have the wisdom of 13 years of adulthood to fall back on, your son doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t have the maturity to act like a grown up in this situation, but he\u2019s been asked to do exactly that. It\u2019s a really difficult situation to navigate and doing it on top of the emotional trauma of missing out on this trip and potentially losing his grandparents (even if he didn\u2019t mention that) at the same time is really hard. He\u2019s a kid going through a lot right now and though his reaction wasn\u2019t appropriate for the situation, it is understandable given his age and maturity level.", "\nIt\u2019s a stressful situation. \nI understand you really needed someone\u2019s help at this time and it is difficult caring for older parents and younger children. Even harder to operate through stressful family situations with kids in tow. I do think your other two kids could have gone with you and your wife and stayed at G&G\u2019s place for a few days watching movies/cartoons and getting takeout-whatever to help out. There may have even been someone (a friend of grandma and grandpa) who could sit at the home. 7 and 11 are also old enough to be a little more self-sufficient and help out a little as well. They aren\u2019t too young to stay indoors for an hour for you to get groceries, for example. Single parents have to do this all the time. \n\nYour HS Senior is both a teenager and an adult who had plans in place and deserved the same respect that you extended to your friends and neighbors. When you asked for his help, he should have the freedom to say no without repercussions. Yes, he is family and there are some expectations of stepping in to help during emergencies whenever you can, but he should not have been forced into it now that he is old enough to mostly care for himself. He is still in that place where he can still be a child.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear anyone saying they are thankful for your son\u2019s time. Just that you paid him. I didn\u2019t hear about anyone apologizing for ruining his trip. You probably did say those things, but did your wife? Is your wife his mom or stepmom? \nI am sure he does care about his grandparents, siblings, and the whole family. The situation went toxic and devolved into name calling and accusations of being uncaring. It\u2019s not surprising that everyone  is upset right now and tensions are high. The whole situation needs some space and time to process all the frustrations and worry to let the steam dissipate. Anyone who resorted to name calling or stepped on others toes should probably apologize. Your family would probably benefit from setting aside time to discuss and negotiate family expectations, respect and boundaries together once things cool down & now that you have a 3rd adult in the house. It might be helpful to have an unbiased counselor to facilitate if things often end up degrading into anger and shutting down. \n\nI don\u2019t quite understand why your adult son is choosing not to go on the rest of his trip now but my guess is 1. it is a stressful time caring for the kids and worrying about G&G. 2. The most interesting part of the trip is over, so there really is no point in going anymore.

Also, you can show him how it\u2019s done with grace, love and sacrifice. Which by that time, he hopefully will get it!

Seems like a weird reaction but there might be context here.", "This is one of the most divisive AITA posts I've ever seen. My vote is NAH\n\nYou all have legitimate grievances, but no one's being an asshole. It's something you *should* work out, and everyone has stuff to own up to, but it sounds like y'all are doing the best given the circumstances (and the kinds of *reasonable* expectations people should have about behavior - just because someone's behavior isn't perfect doesn't mean they're behaving like an asshole).\n\nHere's where your son messed up: his trip isn't ruined, and he's clearly choosing to not go out of pure spite. He hasn't tried to work with you in anyway, again, probably purely out of spite. His behavior is *NEITHER* serving himself or serving you. It's helping no one. This is not adult behavior. He had a legitimate grievance, but this is not the way to handle it, if for no other reason than because in the end it's not even going to get him what he wants.\n\nBut here's where *you* messed up: you didn't give your son a choice. Here's probably the most important question **what would you have done if your son wasn't under your roof or wasn't available?** Would you have just abandoned your kids and left them alone in the gutter? *UNLESSS* your son had already made an explicit agreement to be a backup in an emergency, this is an expectation you are putting on your son that he didn't agree to. What you should have done is thought up an alternative solution which didn't involve your son as a final backup (for example, taking your kids with you). THEN from that place, *ASKED* your son. Like, actually asked them, where there is a possibility he can say no, and where you do not get to resent him for saying no. If you ask from that place, and lay it out clearly how meaningful his *choice* to delay his trip would be, he is much more likely to agree *and* if he does agree, **he gets to feel good** about this kindness/favor he is doing for you. But because it was an expectation instead of a choice, and because you further used your financing of his trip against him, there is no gratitude for what he did for you and there is no place for him to feel good about what he did. I know at the time you didn't know it was going to be a shorter trip and the grandparents were going to survive. But you could have (and should have) taken personal responsibility about that. You could have communicated that you'll check in everyday and get him back on his road trip as soon as possible, if he agrees, and you'll bring the kids up as soon as it makes sense. Instead, you abdicated this responsibility you have as parents by sloughing it on to your adult child.\n\nBut my vote is NAH not ESH. That's because I believe that neither of you guys are behaving like assholes. Your son is rightfully upset. He is not behaving in a way that is constructive, but he's justified in being upset at you. You had an emergency situation and probably weren't thinking clearly. I'm sure your actions seemed perfectly reasonable to you at the time and it's not like this is the simplest conundrum ever to resolve. But your son is now an adult, and if you want him to behave like an adult you need to start treating him like one, which means that if you're going to give him something (like financing a road trip) then *give* it to him. Don't attach strings to it. And if you're going to ask him for a favor *ask* him. Don't expect it or demand it from him.\n\nThere is no resolution to this situation which doesn't start with you sincerely *apologizing first*, and owning up to how it was unfair to not give him a choice, and to revoke your decision to fund his trip, that you should have thought of an alternative option, and although the situation was complicated and tense in the moment, you're now going to take steps to ensure you don't put him in that situation again. Once you fully own up to your actions and the position it put him in, *then* you can address his behavior. And the most important part of his behavior is that refusing to go on the trip isn't even getting him what *he* wants. He has a right to be upset, but if he refuses to accept your offer of a plane ticket to join his friends, let him know that you don't feel responsible for the fact that he'll miss out on the trip. So if the point of skipping the rest of the trip is to make YOU feel bad, it's not going to work. You feel bad that you didn't give him a choice and took back your gift, but you do NOT feel bad about him missing the whole trip if he doesn't take you up on the offer. That's just him facing the consequences of his own spiteful behavior, at that point.", "OP, you need to find out why?

Standing until the sands of struggle grind me down into the bitter dust that consumes us all someday. \n\nI have three kids and they all know this to be true. They understand the pain and sacrifice I have shouldered for them as adults. They know that my smiles during that time were not a lie. It was my pride and honor as a parent to be there for them during the darkest hours.\n\nIt was my job to be the calm and rational one as my wife struggled to fight for her life while my 3rd child was being born. As my 7 and 5 year old threw fits of rage over not seeing mommy and trying to deal with the burden of how she may not come home or that maybe their new brother wouldn't make it. All without any support network whatsoever.\n\nI took care of them when her estranged and abusive father was passing (12,10, and 5 at the time). We took care of him while he passed.

Apologize for how you let him down and try to move on.\n\nYou can chew him out later for catching an attitude, sure and he clearly needs it... but you AND your wife needs it twice as much as he does.

Well in that case they would have had to take the kids but why can\u2019t people see this is a far worse option? If you don\u2019t have time to find a sitter you don\u2019t have time to find a sitter. Plain and simple.

Didn\u2019t expect anything from me until after my other trip (They were back to back.) And although I didn\u2019t drop everything and come home from my current one, I did cancel my next trip. (I drove myself and paid entirely out of my own pocket for both.) I helped my gramma and family begin the long process of cleaning up her house and property (she lives out of town on a farm) so she could sell it, prepare for a garage sale, etc. because that\u2019s the right thing to do. Did I want to go on my other trip? Of course! But family came first in this case. I guess this is a long-winded way of saying is I can\u2019t imagine reacting like that even when I was 18, during a family emergency especially with all the effort put into trying to make the best of a bad situation for the sake of your son OP. I understand being upset at the situation for many reasons (harm coming to your grandparents and having to cancel a trip you\u2019re incredibly excited about) but that anger shouldn\u2019t be directed towards the parents who are trying to make the best of a bad situation.", "NTA.

The crux is 'choice' and he wasn't given it. Everything follows from there. \n\nThere are a lot of people in here that act as if there is a mandated responsibility of someone to act useful in a family emergency; there isn't. It's a choice. Can it be a shitty choice not to help? Absolutely. But it's shittier to never be given the choice to begin with. \n\nTalk to him about that, apologize for not giving him the choice he was due. You took away his autonomy at a pretty important transitional period for a teen and in the midsts of another potential first (death in the family). You aren't an A, NAH for what happened, you are human and did what seemed right given your situation, but show him you are cognizant that in doing that you misstepped and took away his autonomy. \n\nThen, when things have calmed, have an adult conversation with him about what can be expected from him when the family has an emergency, can he be relied on and how should you approach him. This isn't going to be the last time something like this comes up. Set expectations and come to an understanding. \n\nAs for him not wanting to catch up, I could see plenty of non-petty reasons for that, that he's not bothering or willing to share with you.

For example, if your kid got hit by a car or you were out of commission, would she just crumble/be useless or would she handle business?

He definitely took things too far with the yelling in that situation.", "at the end of the day, he might be a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d but THOSE ARENT HIS KIDS. yta. situation sucks but it\u2019s not your kids responsibility to watch your other kids.", "Definitely Asshole. \n\nKids once in a lifetime trip from completing a milestone. \n\nShould have taken the kids.", "No I totally agree with the son you\u2019re an asshole. There was nothing stopping you from taking the kids on the trip with you. The people who are saying the wife needed emotional support so you couldn\u2019t sound idiotic. Their is no reason you can\u2019t give her a hug and be there for her just because your children are around. If anything the parents are the selfish ones putting their own preferences over the child graduation trip. He only graduates high school once.", "YTA - your emergency is not your sons. What would have happened if it had happened on Thursday or after he had already left on Wednesday?  \n\n\nDude had plans. Plans I am guessing were set months or weeks ago to signify his major event. Selfish? yes, but this was his passage to adulthood and you stole it and he may never get over that.", "You could have brought the 7&11 year old \n\nLazy azz", "YTA", "People are so soft nowadays. It\u2019s \u201ctraumatic\u201d kids witnessing everyday life is traumatic nowadays I just pray for the next few generations if you snowflakes will be the ones raising them. These kids will turn into adults who\u2019d have panic attacks just if they meet someone who isn\u2019t picture perfect lol.", "YTA, once in a lifetime thing gone", "I would say YTA since you didn\u2019t just bring your kids with you to visit the grandparents but since you offered to pay for the flights and cabs and he was only needed to help for 2 days I\u2019d say NAH", "In my family all of the kids (including the 18yo) would have gone to see their grandparents...don't get why all the kids had to stay home?", "OP is definitely NTA. His son, however, is OFF THE CHARTS with his entitlement! I'm still trying to pick my jaw up off the floor after reading this. And then at the end when OP says that the friends are heading for Mexico when they were supposed to be going to California. WTF?!? Were these kids seriously planning to leave the country without their parents knowing?? WHAT?!?!?!?\n\nOP is NTA, OP's son is absolutely in another realm of assholery!!!", "ESH.  \n\nThe son has his own life.  He gets to choose.  You didn't force your babysitter, you didn't force your best friend.  But because you raised him or because he lives under your roof or whatever reason, you forced him.  To some extent you have taken away this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nAnd, since the son lacks common decency to accept \"life and death\" as a reason to delay going to the trip, he gets to be an AH too.  The trip was delayed a couple days, big whoop.  While he didn't know that in the initial ask, the initial ask isn't too unreasonable in most families.  \n\nTLDR: You shouldn't have forced him, you didn't HAVE to.  He should have agreed when asked, as a basic human being.", "Is this step wife? Like Are This his siblings or step sibling? Also how is the relationship of your son and your wife? Because Idk I have a feeling there is more to context", "OP should have taken the younger kids with them", "NTA - It was an emergency situation, you tried various other options of childcare for your younger children. Your 18 year old should be mature enough to recognise this was an impossible situation and stepped up to help his parents out. I get this trip was a big deal for him but his grandparents almost dying and his mum losing her parents is a bigger deal. You even offered to help get him on the trip after only 2 days. For him to then have a go at his mum for being upset at almost losing her parents is a major AH move. You also needed to be there for her for moral support. I couldn't go through something like that without my partner's support. I'm sorry you had to deal with this awful situation and glad your wife's parents pulled through.", "Sorry about this whole situation OP. NTA. People on this sub seem to expect perfection of everyone. It would be scary and possibly even traumatizing for the younger kids to see their grandparents so busted up and their parents so distraught, stressed out and possibly if not clearly on edge. Leaving them behind while they (the parents) tried to attend to everything makes sense. They didn\u2019t turn to their 18 year old from the get go they exhausted every option and even tried to get him to join in on the trip albeit after it had commenced. Sorry to the 18 year old who has to miss out on making some incredible memories with his friends but sometimes life happens. The parents are doing their best.", "You\u2019re not the a-hole. Your family members had awful and injurious accident. They needed your help and support. Most 17/18 year olds have a hard time with empathy and compassion. Up until this point in their lives their whole experience is people revolving around them. He\u2019s having a childish tantrum and is not acting like a responsible adult. As a person matures into adulthood they will learn that they are not the center of the universe. That life isn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d and that shit happens. They will also learn, hopefully, that their parents are just people. And all people need help, love, support, have obligations, and experience stress, disappointment, and loss.", "NTA. I dont undersatand the YTA votes in this post. What is wrong with the empathy in your western culture, when your mom is taking care of her parents in critical situation and you are childishly demand the entertaining trip with your pals?\nThe OP\u2019s son behavior is understandable as a selfish teenager, but you are the redditors seeing all the aspect of OP\u2019s situation from the 3rd view and you still vote YTA? what a problem with our society.", "NTA and it must have been disappointing to have your son behave so badly, It was a perfectly reasonable option to have him join the trip after a couple of days and he lost out by sulking like a child and choosing not to go.", "It's also important to remember that this is a teenager whose entire high school experience was coloured by COVID. This probably isn't the first time he was looking forward to an exciting teenage experience only to have to miss out on it for the greater good. He missed out on a lot of things as a freshman through junior so missing out on yet another due to a family emergency hits harder than if he'd had a normal high school experience.\n\nThat doesn't mean it was wrong to ask him to watch the younger kids because of the experience but it explains why he reacted so strongly to the disruption.", ">adults would struggle with the same feelings if they had plans for a fun trip & a family emergency came up. Once that emergency is over. Most people would be disappointed they missed out on their plans. Your son is upset with his situation. It seems like a normal reaction to me. Don\u2019t make it personal.\n\nAdults would also have to deal with work schedules and having to find a co-worker willing to swap schedules and/or having to ask a co-worker to cancel *their* plans. Most will tell the co-worker with the emergency to eat shit. \"Poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine.\" is one of the most thrown around phrases in the tech/programming sector *on an average day*, you can imagine how bad it would be once emergencies are introduced.\n\nYou can bet your ass a lot of the adults ITT eviscerating the kid would throw an even bigger tantrum if their boss decided to cancel their scheduled paid leave because another co-worker is having an emergency.", "Yeah, grandparents would have pulled through or died regardless if they were there \ud83e\udd37\n\nWhy was it not thought to take all the kids, 18 y/o included, and have him watch them at the in-laws house?", "I think its very unlikely that they were willing to bend over backwards changing their plans so they could meet up with him or pick him up from the airport somewhere.", "OP said in other responses that the son is very close to his mom and was very surprising he would be so harsh to her when speaking to her while she was still at the hospital with grandparents.", "Dragging two children to an ICU with their critical condition grandparents so that a third child doesn't miss two days of a vacation is not the superior parenting choice.", "This tradeoff is the part the y.t.a. posts seem to not take into account. How is it better to bring two young children to the hospital to avoid the third much older kid missing two days of a long trip? That's more of an AH parenting move.", "Parents probably didn't ok a trip out of the country.", "And against babies. \n\nBut not teens. They're very understanding of their peers.", "The point is that hypotheticals are dumb when we already know the situation.\n\nHypothetical: what if grandpa died??  Would the 18 year old throw a fit about missing 1-2 days of the trip for a funeral and skip the rest of the trip for _reasons_.\n\nSee how it's trying to paint someone in a corner and make them look bad.  But it isn't what happened.  So let's just judge on the situation since we already have all the required facts to make a moral judgment.", "If OP did that all these Y bites would be raking him over the coals for being a shit husband.", "honestly to me it isn't even a young vs old thing. I just hope its people that don't have a good functioning family or sth that are voting like this. I can't fathom anyone at any age (except idk 0-10 year olds) could ever be so cruel to their parents in this situation.", "I think a lot of people are missing the point that it\u2019s a high school graduation road trip. Yes he individually will have plenty of opportunities for a road trip but to be fair to the kid those kids are all off to different colleges, jobs, trade schools, etc. They sadly won\u2019t all be together ever again because life happens and gets in the way. So I do kinda get the kids view. Missed out on the last outing with his high school friends. Won\u2019t be another one", "Being upset or disappointed is not a problem.   It's natural.  Healthy even.  How you handle those emotions is what's important.   I know they are a teenager but 18 years old is old enough to understand what a family emergency is.  To have the empathy to understand their mother could lose a parent.  To know their siblings and parents need help. \n\nThey didn't think of their family.  They didn't even think of their injured grandparents.   They only thought of themselves.  To quote Homer Simpson \"I only care about M. E. My enjoyment.\"\n\nAnd then declaring the whole trip is ruined because they missed the first two days?  \n\nThat's the selfishness.   Being upset is completely understandable.  It would be strange if they weren't upset.  Acting out the way they did is what made them selfish.   You are not responsible for your feelings, you are responsible for your actions and how you manifest and deal with those feelings.  That's something you teach to toddlers.  This was a high school graduate.", "Seems pretty relevant hypothetical if he\u2019s trying to steer OP to the obvious conclusion of \u201cyou ignored one obvious option, which is take the kids with and let the teenager go\u201d.", "Exactly. I\u2019m old now but if I was that kid and it was my grandparents? I\u2019d have been too sick with worry to enjoy the trip with my friends anyhow.", "Or that grade schoolers should see their parents like that?", "Well, yeah, but his Dad did offer to send him wherever they were for the remaining two weeks, and he didn't accept. That tells me he just wanted to be mad.", "I think the obvious option here is OP and wife calling off the trip because the grandparents might fucking die, but hey, people will make excuses for narcissists for some reason."]}
