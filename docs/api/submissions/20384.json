He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife\u2019s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily. \n\nWe have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn\u2019t sadly. \n\nWe were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room. \n\nI need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn\u2019t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.\n \n\n\nEdit: Well he called his mom, let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn\u2019t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren\u2019t needed. \n\nTalked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concern \n\nFor people saying we didn\u2019t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with.", "created_utc": 1687525933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gy8ir/aita_for_having_my_son_miss_his_graduating_road/", "score": 5553, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this kind of sudden and critical situation you didn't have time to explore any other options (although taking your younger children with you would have been the next best thing) and you also paid him for babysitting.  Your son is also not an AH for being really upset and angry about missing his trip. However, he's only got himself to blame for not going out to meet them for the rest of it after you offered to get him there.", "He\u2019s a teenager. They don\u2019t always think rationally. He\u2019s disappointed that he missed an opportunity he was looking forward to. Which he no doubt believes it was his one & only opportunity to ever have fun. Sadly, he can\u2019t get out of his own way to figure out how to put this back together. He has 2 options .... continue to pout or let you help him get what he wants. Not much more you can do. \n\nIt\u2019s not about his lack of empathy. Grandpa\u2019s fine so what could have happened is not really an issue now. It didn\u2019t happen & now y\u2019all need to figure out how to move forward.\n\nNAH\n\neta \u2014 adults would struggle with the same feelings if they had plans for a fun trip & a family emergency came up. Once that emergency is over. Most people would be disappointed they missed out on their plans. Your son is upset with his situation. It seems like a normal reaction to me. Don\u2019t make it personal.\n\neta more \u2014 based on your edit... you\u2019re trying real hard to make your son the ah here. I\u2019m guessing to absolve yourself in this situation but .... that\u2019s not cool in my book. Don\u2019t throw your own kids under the bus. If your son is that selfish you should ask yourself why or how he got there. Kids don\u2019t raise themselves.", "INFO: If your son had already left for the trip, what would you have done with your two kids?", "NTA- it was a legitimate family emergency and unavoidable. Sending on the trip two days late would be the best options and he needs to get over it.", "What's there a reason you didn't take the younger kids with you? They're at ages where you don't have to keep your eye on them every single second, it shouldn't have been that much of a bother.", "NTA and the people who constantly answer \"he's not your children's parents\" are exhausting and out touch with reality. He wasn't parenting, he was looking after them during an emergency! When something like that happens you are supposed to help your family. You are not an island, your interests and needs are not the only ones that count. OP and wife weren't on vacation, they had to drop everything to go spend time in a hospital where son's grandfather almost died. Needing to assist someone in such conditions trumps a stupid trip. Watching your brothers for that one time because your family is in a horrible situation trumps a trip. The level of selfishness in some comments is absurd.\n\nIf we need to reason like that, then OP and wife shouldn't pay for the trip given that son is an adult. They shouldn't drive him anywhere given that he's an adult. He shouldn't live with them given that he's an adult. Do you see how stupid all this sounds? \n\nIt was an emergency, he had to help. OP even offered to take him to the trip so that he wouldn't lose all of it but son refused. He could still go and spend 12 days with his friends, instead he chose to throw a fit and skip two whole weeks of vacation because he had to stay home for 2 days. Son can be upset, but he chose to be stupid about this. He should have accepted the lift.", "NAH. You had an emergency, it wasn't unreasonable to ask your son to help. But your son is missing out on his trip, he's allowed to be disappointed and angry about what he's already missed. I bet he spent those 2 days getting messages from his friends about how much fun they're having, how much he's missing out on, maybe even how dumb it is that he had to stay home. I know you intended to get him back on the trip, but I understand him feeling like the whole trip is ruined. Once he calms down you need to have a plan *ready* to get him to his friends. More \"I can buy your plane tickets for the town they're in tomorrow and your hotel reservation for tonight so you can meet them there, or do you have a different preference\" than \"okay, what do you want me to do here?\"\n\nYou've said it yourself: you don't know what you would have done with your younger kids if your son was already gone. You need to figure this out, have a plan other than your son, because he will come to understand your choice, but he is never going to forget the time he missed out on, at least some of, his trip. I'm sure he has plans now, he isn't going to be available to you the way he has been, and you need to be prepared for him to flat out refuse to help if he's busy.", "Nta its shitty yes, but there are 12 days left?????  Can he not fly to where they are and go from there.", "NAH - IDK I'm really shocked at everyone saying bring the 7 and 11 year old. He missed 2 days of a 12 day trip for a life threatening emergency. He can be disappointed but I would have done the same.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry about what your family is going through wishing your in laws a speedy recovery. This was definitely a family emergency and through your comments you even clarified that there was no other option other than having your son babysit. Your son has every right to be upset, but I\u2019m surprised by how he\u2019s much more upset about missing a trip with his friends than seeing his mother almost lose her parents. I would have said N A H but your son seems very entitled in this entire situation and keeps putting himself and his situation over an actual family emergency, even after you offered him a solution by letting him go to the rest of the trip.", "Honestly YTA \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t take your kids, it\u2019s their grandparents who were in critical condition after all. \n\nAnd what would have happened if he already left?", "NTA. Emergencies happen. He could have still had 12 days on the trip. Not to mention has he shown any concern for\nHis grandparents? You had multiple back up plans that failed. Not your fault.", "NTA.  Your son is a member of a FAMILY.  Shit happens.  Priorities sometimes change - sometimes HAVE to change.  Good for you, and him, for stepping up when necessary.  If kids/teens don't learn, that sometimes they can be disappointed when things don't go their way, you get grown ass men who don't think they need to step up when family emergencies happen.  What?  Wife's mother is in hospital?  Oh well, Daddy's got a golf tournament.  Kids can go visit sick granny. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA in this situation, unfortunately you haven't raised your son well. An 18 year old isn't a toddler and should be mature enough to handle missing a a bit of fun if there is a family emergency.\n\nAt 18 he may be to old for you to influence his character now. Hopefully you can do a better job with the younger kids.", "I might be the only one thinking it was only 2 days he missed out of 14 and it was for a family emergency\u2026\ud83e\udd14\n\nOn the other had if he had already left, you would have had no choice but to take them with you or farm one of the out to a friend etc.  \n\nNTA", "NTA I can\u2019t believe people think that an 18 yr olds vacation is more important than taking care of family in an emergency situation. I understand why the 18 yr old is upset, he is only 18 & at that age you think yr friends are more important than family, but they aren\u2019t.", "NTA, these responses are insane. It was a family emergency where two people almost DIED. I can't believe he was still in a mental or emotional state to want to go on the trip anyway after that (if grandpa had died, would he have chosen to miss the funeral for this trip? Because it's sounding like it), and beyond that, he could still have made all but two days of the trip and is now just throwing a tantrum with no purpose other than to make everyone feel even worse than they already do. The lack of understanding and compassion he is showing here is incredible.", "NTA.\n\nUnder the circumstances there were no good options and I don't think you did anything wrong. Those people suggesting you could have taken the kids with, dropped your traumatised wife at the hospital to deal with things on her own, and been the babysitter - I doubt they've ever been in this type of situation - or even have the empathy to imagine themselves in this situation. It's very much a *me me me* mindset which is pretty disturbing.", "NTA. He missed fun plans. Boo hoo. Grandma and grandpa are in the HOSPITAL!!! \n\nIt was a legit emergency. You even offered to fly him out. 2 days less of a 2 week vacation is hardly much. He\u2019s being entitled. No one is entitled to fun, when family is in the hospital like this. If they\u2019d passed, would he have opted to go on his friend vacay instead of going to the funeral? He\u2019s seriously prioritizing his friends over family. \n\nThat said, don\u2019t punish him too much. He\u2019s still a teenager. He\u2019ll get over himself. Heck, I had a family member who tried to make me babysit so they could go shopping when it was MY mom who was hospitalized. They were a full adult.", "WTF is up with all the YTA votes? It sounds like they did the best they could with a horrible situation. They looked for other sitters even including neighbors but no one was available. Taking the 2 kids with them would have made a horribly stressful situation even worse especially since the where at the hospital for around 48 hours. Mom was in no shape to help look after them considering she is probably thinking her dad might be dying. The 18 year old was the last option and was payed for it as well as them saying they will try to make it up to him. \n\nNAH - They did there best and the 18 year old is a loud to be upset but this was an emergency situation.", "People really?   Grand's were 4 hours away and it was EMERGENT!  You can pack up two kids and adults to be 8 hours away as an emergency?  Who are you people?  She had to get there..  no way shes driving 4 hours alone not knowing whos going to be alive or dead at that point.  \n\nAnd you absolve an 18 year old for having any empathy for his mom, dad and grands?  Pouting over a pleasure trip that could probably be done later?  This is how life goes -   \n\nNTA - in an emergency you react as best you can with what you have.  You did.   18 is no longer a kid - he needs to broaden his little world.", "If you\u2019re trying to get him there now then NTA. Shit happens and I get not wanting to drag your other kids to the hospital, but it also sucks missing your graduation trip (or part of it). His anger may also be due to fear about the grandparents and he\u2019s not expressing that. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s scary and upsetting for you as well. It sucks for everyone involved but you\u2019re doing the best you can. He will look back and understand one day. I hope your family heals from this accident and emotional trauma. Hopefully you can get him to his trip too", "NTA. You were dealing with a life or death situation. You should do something to show that you recognize he had to give up something major he wanted to look after his family. He's understandably mad and overreacting like teenagers do. It's a shitty situation all around but you did the right thing. Hope your family is well", "NTA,  don't listen to the folks saying you could have taken the kids with you to the hospital waiting room, that would have been stressful for the kids, your wife & yourself. Your father in law was critical, which am sure was very difficult for you wife, she didn't need the added stress of the them being there or the distraction that would have caused.  Your son needs to realize that things can happen to alter our plans, you did offer a compromise, he decided it to turn it down.", "NTA, He is young and you harmed his plans in his eyes. He will feel different at 30 when he sees how life gets in the way. It was a family emergency...He could have finished up the trip...Well taken of children are selfish and don't have the benefit of sacrifice kids with not so good families have...It is a back handed compliment. So apologize, and let him fester. He may end up going.", "NTA.\n\nAll these people saying take the kids with you- absolutely unhinged. A trauma hospital is NOT a place for children and it's really inappropriate to bring them for potentially days. Many hospitals still have no children visiting guidelines, and even if there isn't a policy, taking care of children's needs (which include not witnessing trauma firsthand) takes you away from the necessary things you needed to do like meet with doctors, make difficult medical decisions, etc. \n\nFamily emergencies come before individual plans. That's too bad, but it's realistic. \n\nAnd your son's refusal to join now is... Something. Give it a day, check in, offer to drive him to meet the friends, and forgive everybody including yourself.", "NTA.. y\u2019all people have no sense of family.. y\u2019all are selfish people..", "NAH", "I'm going to say NAH. I understand why you and your wife did what yall did but I also understand why your son felt such crushing disappointment. \n\nWhat I dont understand is why your son is refusing to now go on his trip even after talking to his mom.  Is it guilt over how he reacted or did his friends find someone else to replace him on the trip so there is no longer room for him?  You need to sit your son down and  find out.  Give him room to talk it out then yall figure out together what can be done to make this right for him", "NTA Your kid was always going to have feelings about this. You only asked due to the emergency and you tried to make it up to him. Try again.", "NTA - He should help the family in this occasion. You even try to make amends and he was being selfish. \nHope he came bake to his senses after the photos your wife send him. \nHope your IL recovery well to.", "NTA \n\nIt was an impossible situation, and your son would've lost only 2/3 days of a while vacation. He cared more about a vacation than his grandparents almost dying, I think he really needs to grow up.", "NTA, it sounds like you exhausted all possible options.\n\nThat however doesn't really matter now. Get him out of that room and drive him to meet his friends.\n\nHe's sulking now, but he'll regret not going when you offered it to him.\n\nDo what you can to get that boy to go on the rest of this road trip.", "NAH (assuming there was a valid reason you couldn't take the younger kids with you). Emergencies happen. Contingency plans fall through. If you can insist that since you paid for this trip, he's bloody going to get off his butt and Go for as much time as you can get him there.... I think he will ultimately salvage some fun out of it.  If you let him sulk in his room and miss out entirely, he will hold that grudge in his head until he is old and grey.\n\nRuining the first part of his trip is unfortunate, but his refusal to even try to salvage part of it is... well... immature. Which he is. Be a parent and force him to go on the remainder of the trip. It's for his own good.", "NAH. I've been basically that teen though. Family emergency with mom's medical stuff. Sometimes it sucks. Sometimes all you can do is ask a teen (senior) to solo halfway across a country to get back to class or drive across a state they don't know to help. Other days it's drive a parent to the ER. Or watch a younger sibling (I wasn't paid a few years back but it was a soft I was basically garenteed some pizza from a pizza shop. Even now I wouldn't take payment in terms of cash but help with meals/entertainment) during a tough moment. It's hard when medical shit goes down.\n\nBut as someone who also graduated during COVID, I legit was angry. I had to grieve my senior events. Imagine being promised this big grand thing, and then it's taken away. It's not about the days left, it'll be what you missed. And my parents did everything they could to give me a senior finish. Driveway prom was cute and fun (got to dance with my whole family, father/daughter slow song, snacks I choose, a fancy dinner that was picked up, my cute dress, mom got hers out), graduation meal at a restaurant with everyone important just like I had wanted and my choice. But I also lost out on prom with my friends. I lost those final days with them. \n\nYour teen totally can be upset. But make it right. I know you offered, but help a bit more than just finances. Ask where he would love extra time. Make it happen. Or better yet, when the trip is over have all his friends be treated to some fun activity together.", "NTA- This is a case of things conspiring to derail plans. It's a good lesson to your son, that some things have to take priority over others. A life threatening accident certainly takes precident over a road trip. One MUST be dealt with, while the other is completely optional. Honestly, your son faied this test of his character. He is acting like a spoiled, entitled little brat. Ask him if he'd be happier getting ready to attend his grandparents funeral. I'm sure you regret he couldn't go, but you were between a rock and a hard spot. You couldn't send your wife off on her own to deal with this tragedy and stay home to deal with the other kids. That's a betrayal of your commitment to help and support your wife. Your son needs to have a check up from the neck up; his value system is 'way the hell out of whack.", "NAH - it's tragic when something horrible like that happens to anyone's family members. This isn't something that was foreseen. You had no way of knowing this was going to happen. \n\nThere's been a lot of people ruling one way or another here but I don't think anyone here is at fault. Your son had every right to be upset about not going on the graduation trip. It had been scheduled in advance and it was unreasonable to expect all the other kids to delay the trip. The fact that he could've gone later and met up with them isn't the same as going with them.\n\nYou also had every right to expect that in a family tragedy that your son should step up and not go so he could watch your two younger kids. Often unexpected things like this happen and in the absence of any other solution, someone invariably has to make a sacrifice.\n\nThat being said, you could have easily taken your two kids with you. By your own admission, you were gone only two days and your wife stayed while you came back home. Your two kids were 12 and 7, not newborns. They could easily have gone with you and you could have kept an eye on your kids in the waiting room while your wife stayed with her father.\n\nThere are way too many people here who feign shock that anyone would suggest taking two young children into the ER or a waiting room because kids just can't handle that kind of thing and would be subject to possible trauma. Get the fuck outta here with that nonsense. \n\nIt's called life people. I grew up in a military family and spent many a day in the ER with my parents waiting at the base hospital. I saw all kinds of shit (victims of car accidents, helicopter accidents, gun range incidents, tank accidents, etc.), but that didn't adversely affect my psyche in anyway. Kids are far more robust than our current soft-skinned society act like they really are. People need to grow the fuck up. Exposure to real life causes maturity. Lack of any exposure to real life and what goes on results in thin skinned snowflakes.\n\nAnyway, neither you nor your son are in the wrong. He's angry right now, but he'll get over it. He'll come to understand that you made the best decision you could given the circumstances. You'll make it up to him in some form or fashion and it'll all work out for the best.\n\nBest of luck to you both.", "I won\u2019t say YTA, because you likely weren\u2019t thinking clearly is this emergency. However, the younger children could have gone with you and your wife and stayed at her parents house while the two of you were at the hospital. At 11 a child is old enough to feed and look after a younger sibling and make a phone call if help is needed. You made a decision that was based on what was easiest for everyone but your oldest child. That\u2019s going to be a bitter pill for your oldest child for a while. Your wife sending the photos of her father\u2019s injuries to that child was way out of line. Instead of hearing what he was saying, she dumped double-barreled guilt on him.", "NAH family emergencies take precedence. He\u2019s allowed to be upset that he missed his trip, but responsibility is what it is. and especially if you offered to help him link w his friends for the rest of the road trip", "NAH, families emergencies happen... and thats it...\nOP tried lots of options that didn't work... and when he came back he tried to fix or at least diminished the trip situation.\n\nHe paid his son for his services and tried to take him to his friend so they could continue to trip.\n\nOn the other hand I understand the sons frustration we all have them regardless of age.\n\nAnd if people prefer to go this way, son ins under his roof and also parents where paying for the trip, it does not change thr NTA, but for some people it can add.\n\nEverything sound fair for me so... NAH", "NTA.  Emergencies happen at inconvenient times.  Sometimes you have to do the unfun thing to help family.  He can still do the rest of his trip if he wants.  Don\u2019t get angry back.  He\u2019s a disappointed teen and they don\u2019t really cope well.  Offer him some options and let him know if they are time limited.  Like you can go drive to meet them, but you need to leave by 2PM or there is a flight at 4 PM.  Which does he want to do?", "Im probably going to get downvoted to hell, but I'm going to say nta. Honestly, all your children  should have gone to the hospital to make sure their grandparents were ok. I'm glad to hear they're alright.", "NTA. I feel bad he missed his trip but he could've just gone and met them a few days later. I feel like you could've taken them with you, but I also understand keeping two young kids in a waiting room isn't realistic. And clearly your wife needed you to be there with her. Sometimes you need to do things for your family, especially in an emergency.", "NTA. I seriously do not understand the y t a votes, and I'm not sure if it's a combination of people too young to actually be in these situations or people who are projecting person issues.\n\nYou've tried every option possible to find alternative care for your children. When you have to ask the neighbors, you know you're in a bottom of the barrel desperate situation. The comments saying you should have had emergency plans are so tone deaf. You did go through your emergency plans. Further, from your comments, it was not feasible to bring your kids. Your wife was in no place to take care of anyone, and you were busy handling hospital papers ans updates. For the comment saying to leave your children at your IL's place, like what? So your kids are still unsupervised but in another location? Or comments saying to leave them in a hospital waiting room? It's not the hospital's responsibility to babysit kids, and it doesn't sound like either you or your wife could have supervised them. The only other option, it sounds like, was to either leave them in the hospital room with the mangled bodies of their grandparents or leave them at home for 2 days with their brother. \n\nThe fact that your son had 12 days out of a 14 day trip cements the NTA to me. You offered to pay for him to meet up with his friends so he could enjoy the rest of his trip. He decided that no, he would rather be mad that he missed 2 days and would miss the remaining 12 days as spite. That's on him. \n\nAs an aside, if I had heard my grandparents were in a fatal accident I would not be able to go on any trip. Your comment indicates that he is close to his grandparents, so it's weird to me that he glosses over their accident to be upset about a trip. For those of you saying that this is the biggest trip ever and its a once in a lifetime - the kid is 18, I'm pretty sure he'll have more memorable trips that don't require him to feel like his grandparents' accident was an inconvenience.", "I mean, NTA imo and shit was taken from me constantly as a kid. In this situation, he's being a brat. People are in the hospital. I know he's only 18 but he can learn now or later that emergencies happen and plans change. Twelve days is plenty, and he got paid. I don't get it. It sounds like a tantrum to me.", "NTA. It was an incredibly serious family emergency. You tried multiple options to find someone to stay with your younger children, and you needed to be there. You paid him, and even were going to drive him cross country to meet up with his friends, he would only have missed 2 days of a 14 day trip. \n\nSometimes life bites us in the arse.\n\n*Edited because I went on an unnecessarily long rant about vaguely related personal experiences.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, just my opinion, hospitals are very scary places for kids to be ESPECIALLY when they\u2019re young enough to kinda understand what\u2019s going on (we\u2019re here because grandpa might not survive and we\u2019re just gunna be in the waiting room for 2 days to see what happens) there\u2019s no use traumatizing kids in medical settings so if THEY ever have to go to the hospital their memory of it isn\u2019t \u201cgrandpa came here and never left, am I gunna never leave here too?\u201d (Ik grandpa pulled through but he might not have, they didn\u2019t know)", "YTA. You knew he had a trip and I see no reason from your story why you couldn't have brought the younger kids with you aside from it being an emotionally charged situation and them being inconvenient. They are your responsibility ultimately, not his. What would you have done if he had already left on his trip and it had happened? Would you have demanded he come back from his trip to watch your other kids?\n\nIt's also not your job to police how he feels about his grandparents. People are allowed to feel however they feel about people, especially family that they don't get to choose. I was never particularly close with my mom's parents. We showed up together at family events, but we never had a one on one relationship. Do I love them? Sure. But there's a distance between us that has never been bridged.

My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily. \n\nWe have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old.

It took me years to accept that I was still a child, and under that level of stress and confusion, I wasn't going to make the perfect decision. \n\nEverything about this situation sucks, but ultimately, each person reacted exactly as I would expect them to.", "I don't think this kid realizes how lucky he is to even have Grandparents to worry about at his age. I never even knew mine (both mom and dad sides) due to them passing away before I was born or when I was very young and had zero memory of.", "I honestly think a lot of the yta votes are from high school or about to be college age kids that don't understand how bad this situation was for everyone in it. NAH is the correct answer and it sucks you aren't top comment.", "What kind of person cares about a road trip more than their grandparents almost dying in a car accident.", "Yeah that was a classic teenager reaction, I don\u2019t hold it against him (cuz uh, he\u2019s a teenager) but he\u2019ll look back on that and cringe. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. \n\nHe lost two days of a two week trip, his dad is offering to get him out to where the trip is (!!) and he says no?  That part is officially on him. \n\nNow if I had reacted that way (can only speak for\nMyself) it would have been for some obscure embarrassing reason I didnt want to explain to my parents, like I had gotten it all set up that I would share the back seat with my crush and she would fall asleep with her head on my shoulder during the quiet overnight driving hours and she would discover she\u2019s madly in love with me, and now that dad messed up the seating arrangements by <checks notes> having the grandparents get into a serious accident, my love life is RUINED. FOREVER. \n\nNot saying that\u2019s what happened here, but if I personally had made a judgement call seemingly that petty and counterproductive to my own aims, there would have been some underlying (probably embarrassing, probably about a girl) reason for it.", "Agreed. Also sometimes teens (and even adults) cannot grasp the gravity of a situation, and sometimes they have a one track mind (I.e the last trip before college with his buddies).

I was supposed to go on an amazing, once in a lifetime trip where my fianc\u00e9 was going to propose to me. Family emergency with a relative in the hospital. And you\u2019re totally right. I, an adult, was so disappointed and down about it, but the suddenness of the family emergency was much more important. This is absolutely a lesson in how cruel life can be sometimes. There is no golden way out of it. \n\nSo all the people calling OP the AH for making their kid miss a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d trip are really confusing me. They paid for it.

The dad even focused on getting the son on the trip once the emergency was cleared and the entitled little so and so threw a tantrum because if he couldn't have all of it, he didn't want any of it.

This isn't one of those cases where the parents left a kid to raise his siblings. And if the kid had left, then yes, maybe they would have had no other choice.

My parents were obviously not doing great (it fully burst and she was initially misdiagnosed, so she was in a bad physical state by the time she got to surgery) and the rest of us were too young to get how bad the situation was.

Lots of people don\u2019t babysit bc they don\u2019t like it, or also they\u2019re unqualified, have pets kids are allergic to, etc. You can\u2019t dump your kids with anyone over 18- lots of people don\u2019t have lots of babysitting options. \n\nAs a parent, I couldn\u2019t imagine having two younger kids crawling all over the hospital. It\u2019s also ridiculous to assume dad would stay at in laws with the younger sibs. What if mom needs support at the hospital?

As a result, my parents have no idea when I started walking, or said my first words, or a lot of those milestones that happen. My baby book is half empty. There aren't even a lot of baby pictures of me. My brother is 2 years older, and they have all that stuff on him. Do I resent my parents for that? Fuck no, it's not their fault. Shit happens.

OP needs to talk to him more because something happened in those first 2 days that is the real issue.", "I can't fathom being so self centered that I wouldn't turn around and come back for a family emergency.", "Well he wasn't, so they didn't.  Pointless comment.", "I don't know if people are genuinely being serious or if they didn't read the whole post, but like. the kid lost 2 days of his 14 day trip. like man. that's just not a big deal. Not compared to a possible death of one's parents at least. If he missed the entire opportunity to be with friends then I can understand his reaction but like, missing 14% of it is life and you just gotta suck it up. It's not the kids fault but sometimes when you're an adult you have to step up to the plate when people need you. It's the clearest NAH I've ever seen", "If I was in high school and this happened, I still would have the emotional and mental maturity to understand the situation. Some people are either sociopaths or projecting their own shitty upbringing HARD.", "It is. No adult would think op is in the wrong here. \n\nThey want OP to bring two young children to the hospital while they deal with their grandparents possibly dying, what the fuck.", "I feel like that's the case more by the day. The kids need life experience, and I understood covid took that away from them, by come on some responses to these are unhinged", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t think about it either until one time I gave a rude reply to a comment trying to give some bad legal advice with something like \u201cthis advice sounds like it\u2019s coming from someone who just took their first high school civics class\u201d and the reply I got was \u201cyeah I\u2019m 16 so what? Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know how the world works\u201d\n\nLol. So yeah\u2026", "What's infuriating is it's not like he even had to miss the whole trip, it was a few days and it sucks because he was obviously really looking forward to it, but now he's rejected the chance to join up for the remaining 12 days out of immaturity and spite.  This was a legit family emergency and one of those times where you need to step the fuck up.  OP must have insane self control because the tone of his post is so neutral, if I were in his position there's no way I would be able to hide my disappointment.  Son could have banked a ton of gratitude and respect from his parents.  When I think about my relationship with my parents some of the memories that stick out the most are those moments where I could tell that they felt they raised me to be a good person with good values.", "I really appreciate this comment and the above comments. I remember when I started going through these subreddits about a year ago, I was a bit culture shocked with how quickly everyone would advise divorce in almost every situation. I was wondering if any of these idiots themselves had ever been married or if they understood what marriage vows were about. I'm not anti divorce or anything but it's not the only solution to every problem. Often times, it's the wrong thing to do.\n\nI was also taken back by how often people were imploring that folks should go no contact with their families; how quickly people use the term gaslighting and abuse. I'm not saying these aren't valid terms and I'm not saying these things don't happen. I just feel like they're overused and being applied to scenarios that don't warrant them.", "Gah damn the snort I did when I read this is gonna be enough to get us through the shift, thank you holy shit I hope you have a great day,", "I wouldn\u2019t brush all teenagers with the same brush, I feel like people who lack empathy are overrepresented on this sub as well as being teenagers.

It is a priorities issue.

It wasn't until the night before he died that they said I could come and ONLY if I was on my absolute best behavior and ONLY because he begged them to see me. So the kids probably wouldn't have even been allowed back with or without Covid stuff.", "This. My mom went to the ER recently. Only one person allowed in with her. Her bf had to wait outside while I went in with her. OP is NTA at all.", "It was really not healthy for you to be there. If your mother had any other choices, I am sure she would have taken them. In this case, they had another choice.", "But why drag the kids if he doesn't have too? That's just asnine and a lot to deal with when you are focusing on doctors and other things. I'm sorry your mom dragged you through that.", "Yeah wtf is this shit. Kids would be losing their shit after an hour. Worst place to brings kid.", "One options being that the entitled 18 year old grow a soul and actually give a crap about his family!!", "OP's wife was in an accident, so we don't know if she was capable of being alone, let alone with two other kids. We also can't assume they could stay at the in-laws house. There are multiple scenarios were they wouldn't be able to do so.", "Until they all find out every 18 year old regardless of what stupid generation they came out of are self centered, it\u2019s brain development not restricted to a generational thing \u2026 people will find anything to blame or hate but each generation has their baggage and their good parts", "Yeah, it seems like the situation has resolved about as well as it could have. Of course the kid was upset and disappointed. Missing out on something big when you're 18 DOES feel like the end of the world. There really won't be another grad trip, and joining the group halfway through really won't be the same. \n\nBut once he understood the gravity of the situation, he came around. Good lad. Life can be unfair sometimes.\n\nRedditors are mostly very young, and still in that teenage mindset (even if they're no longer technically teens).", "The people voting YTA scare me! Do y'all have zero empathy? \n\nDefinitely NTA OP!", "I\u2019m honestly wondering if the demographics of the sub has changed a lot recently. Like there are a lot more kids just too inexperienced in life to understand how people they love have sacrificed for them and that if they love someone, that means sacrificing for your loved ones sometimes. There have always been wild opinions ignoring basic human decency and basic family obligations for \u201ctechnically you aren\u2019t obligated to sacrifice at all when the people that you love need you\u201d kind of arguments but I seem to notice them more now.", "It's Reddit, it's filled with 18 year olds, what do you expect", "Plus the parents paying for the trip! It is understandable that an 18 year old is upset because they are still emotionally walking the line between teen and adult. HOWEVER this is exactly the time of limited time situation where he can learn to grow up and act like an adult when necessary. If he misses the entirety of the trip that is completely on him for his pouting and refusing to find a compromise. OP is most definately NTA", "Yeah I don\u2019t get these peoples responses \u2014 I\u2019m more concerned that the kid himself would have been fine and able to have fun on some trip when two of his grandparents were on the verge of dying.", "I\u2019m guessing many of the YTA people are closer in age to OP\u2019s son than OP, and having a little bit of life experience makes a difference.", "And everybody hates their family, can\u2019t forget that part", "There's some serious 80s high school bully jock storyline bad guy vibes going on here.

I know it was sarcasm but there are people who actually think like this lmao. \n\nPeople who don\u2019t work in the medical field are absolutely delusional about what it means to be a nurse. Have 100% been asked to babysit before", "Yeah your mother's parents are critically injured and your more worried about a trip. Shows a insane lack of empathy. Even when I was around 12 when my grandpa died I knew it was important to be there for my mom. Like what kind of family dynamics do the people who say YTA have? Op even paid the brat to babysit! I know parentfication is bad, but sometimes older siblings need to step up in emergencies.", "He is upset because he is 18 and they are still emotionally growing up.

Like he's upset but he also could just be lashing out due to stress.", "Seriously, i understand the kid\u2019s mentality, but if he\u2019s a half way decent human being he will probably look back at this in a decade and just think about how much of a little shit he was.", "Some realllllll big privilege being thrown around here. They asked their son to delay a vacation they paid for, 2 days. And he threw a temper tantrum.", "Yes. Imagine being seven and seeing your mother have a breakdown.

Doesn't want to tell Dad that his buddies are actually waiting for him in Vegas lmao", "Sure. He is entitled to his feelings. But he antagonized his dad and mom after a traumatic event. Made his mom cry. He should have gone to the gym and punched some bags. He IS going to look back and be disappointed in himself.

For example, a lot of times the waiting room is where people are taking turns saying goodbye to their dying relative and there's the full spectrum of grief. I've had people throw furniture, vomit/pass out, scream and wail.... Adding kids to that mix is not a good idea. Even teenagers we usually get a child therapist to meet with them and prep/support them.\n\nSo, suffice to say, it may not have been possible to have both kids in the waiting room.", "People in the AITA sub are very militantly against parentifying teenagers, which, *yeah* that's bad, but its gotten to the point where a teenager having any responsibilities at all or having to help their family in any way is read as parentifying and/or shirking parental duties.

It is his family in bad state and needing help.", "What people that say this kid of stuff fail to realise there are benefits to being part of a family unit. There is a give and take as well. You can\u2019t have both, can\u2019t have the benefits of a family and expect to give nothing in return. It\u2019s not contractual arrangement but one made out of love and respect. \n\nI have a kid like OP and she\u2019s absolutely self centred. Expects everyone to cater to her whim but refuses to give anything in return then pikachu face when boundaries are set and she doesn\u2019t get her way.

At least I hope so.", "There are actual psychopaths in this thread and the fact that the ones who are 100% serious about him being an asshole really truly mean it is what scares me. These clowns are actually walking among us.", "At 18, my friends would have excoriated me if they found out I had abandoned my family during a crisis just to go on a trip with them. It's wild that some people are trying to normalize such a complete lack of compassion and empathy.", "Oh I absolutely can. I know what I was like as an 18-year old. I'd have definitely wanted to go on the trip because some foolish part of me would think that my grandfather couldn't die while I was away, or that it wouldn't hurt, or that I couldn't possibly regret it. Obviously, I'd have been extremely wrong, as the numerous losses of loved ones has taught me. So I get why the kid's upset. That being said, it's totally on him for throwing a fit and not going on the rest of the trip. Teenage angst at its strongest.", "Seriously! I don't have a younger brother but I would've gladly babysat cousin who lives nearby at 18 in this situation. Emergency definitely is more important than some drinking trip.", "Exactly.

I can imagine it.", "I hate this idea that people have to care about each other just because they\u2019re family. You have no idea what the kids relationship is like with his grandparents. Maybe they were consistently shitty to him his whole life?
