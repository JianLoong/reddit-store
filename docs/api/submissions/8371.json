I work full time from home, my boyfriend also works full time. \n\nIn my current household, we get by fine. I've always wanted child support since the divorce but my ex husband has always manipulated me to not do it. At first, he promised to pay me $50 a month since we had 50/50 custody. The $50, was for gas since we lived 45 minutes from each other. When my ex went to the academy, he was unable to maintain 50/50, so we moved to 70/30. He would see the kids on the weekends if he could. If not, I kept the kids. During that time he did not pay me any money. He said he couldn't afford it. He said maybe after the academy. \n\nAfter the academy, we lived 10 miles from each other, and still maintained 70/30 because his schedule was not stable. Still no child support, this time he told me he couldn't afford it because he had bills. I felt bad because I thought I had bills too, so who am I to question him. \n\nWe each moved to new homes. It was about an hour from each other. We continued to maintain 70/30. No child support, still. This time, he said it was because he bought a new house and couldn't afford it. \n\nMost recently, my ex and cousin purchased a home 10 minutes from my home. It has been about a year. In the last year he's purchased a brand new electric truck. And my cousin purchased a new SUV. In conversation he mentioned how last year he made so much money. He asked if I could help calculate if he'd get any money back in taxes. He made $160,000 last year and my cousin made $52,000. I asked him how come he tells me he never has any money. His response \"I don't know how to manage it. I like to eat out a lot. And any time there is a new gun, I want to buy it. Plus your cousin always wants to go out on the weekends\"\n\nThis upset me. The excuse wasn't bills, or the new house. Together my boyfriend and I made about $95,000 which is enough for us to live fine. But why can't I live a little more care free? Buy my kids a couple more pairs of shoes. Go out to dinner with my kids. Maybe to go the movies a few times with my kids.\n\nSeems like the perfect time to tax my ex husband.
