You have FIVE children to care for and he needs to pay his share for the THREE that are his.", "First of all, child support is not punishment, it\u2019s literally financial support for the children you created. \n\nYou were an idiot for not pursuing it from the very beginning.", "NTA not getting child support deprives your children.", "**ESH**\n\nHe's an AH for clearly obvious reasons\n\nBut you're an AH, not for asking for child support now, but for sitting there for SIX YEARS and letting him just decide not to pay you, or to pay you an absolutely insulting $50 a month or whatever he felt like . . . basically letting him make all the decisions about what you deserved or what he should contribute to the financial support of  his own damn children, even though you were divorced, and there was absolutely no reason why you should have been letting him make decisions about anything at all for you.  WHO DOES THAT? Who lets their cheating ex-husband tell them, \"I'm just not going to give you any money for the kids?\" and says, \"Oh, okay.\" WTF? \n\nIt was for the court to decide what he could afford, not him. And it was for the court to tell him whether he should pay, not you. Your poor kids. You completely cheated them because you couldn't even stand up to a man who openly disrespected you.\n\nThat money wasn't yours to say yes or no to. It was owed to your children. And if you didn't want or need it, that was six years' worth of money that could have been put into savings for them. Potentially thousands of dollars. I hope to God you can get some of it now at least. It's the least you owe them.", "You are more than reasonable for wanting child support. Discussing child support with your ex has gotten you nowhere. You file for child support with the court. And you stop muddying the waters with what he and his partner make vs what you and your partner make. Your partners\u2019 incomes have no bearing here. It is what you make and what he makes and the disparity with the times the children are with each of you. The court only cares about the 3 children and the two parents ability to provide for them. You need to be really objective when you go to court, not that you want to live a little more carefree but you want your children to have what they deserve from both their parents.\n\nEDIT: NTA but your lack of standing up to your ex is affecting your quality of life with your children so a little bit of being TA for letting him get away with BS.", "NTA\n\nQuit being a doormat, you should have been getting money for the kids when he stopped spending half the time with them. He\u2019s been playing you the whole time. You subsidized that truck, and that house, and all the date nights he takes your cousin on.\n\nYour kids have less because of him.", "I'm going through this exact same thing. I ultimately decided to file so I did. Today actually. \n\nHere's what my attorney told me; \"You're not entitled to child support,  your child is entitled to child support. \n\nChild support payments are based on how much you have them. The more you have them, the more he has to pay. You can also collect back child support. My kid is 4 and I can only go back 3 years. Check with your local law office and see how many years you can collect on. \n\nHis major purchases prove he can afford to pay. My ex just purchased a 2021 Camaro and is planning on buying a house this year whereas I'm having trouble paying rent. That's what made me decide to file. \n\nRemember these words; You're not entitled to child support, your children are. \n\nReach out if you need additional moral support. I know how you feel. \ud83e\udde1", "NTA. He should have been paying all along. Get it set up and they'll take it from his paycheck and he can figure out how to live on the rest.", "Ex is an AH, but soft YTA\u2026\nfor not educating yourself on child support and custody arrangements. You\u2019ve made life hard on yourself and your immediate family for long enough. Sue his ass for support, like yesterday. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US, contact your state\u2019s attorney general, some states have entire child support divisions. \n\nMy dad was required to pay my mom almost $200/month back in 1988 for just me. \n\n1-9-8-8!!!!  That\u2019s 35 years ago. \n\nYour ex-husband played you. There\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d have to pay a ton in child support per kid. Cops have to serve arrest warrants to dead beat parents that don\u2019t pay child support all the time. \n\nNot to sure, but you may be able to get back payments or part of his tax refund. If he refuses to pay, then have his wages garnished. This way, you get paid his child support payment before he even gets to blow his check on guns, toys and eating out. \n\nEven if you split custody, who is paying for health insurance, clothes, shoes, extra-curricular activities, tuition? Start a paper trail of any past and future expenses to present the courts. \n\nIf your kid turns 18 in the middle of the school year, ex will still be required to pay until child finishes high school. Not sure if you can request coverage into the first couple of years in college since you\u2019ve been screwed over for 6 years. Can\u2019t hurt to ask. \n\nDid your divorce attorney not go over custody arrangements and child support?", "YWNBTA. He is required by law to help support his children. He knows this.", "As the former wife of a law enforcement officer, I'd also like to add in that you should ensure that all of your child custody/visitation/child support conversations with your ex be done through some sort of app that allows it to be recorded. I sadly know of a few former wives that, when trying to get child support etc, ended having to deal with a bit of harassment from both buddies of their ex who were on the force as well as court officers who knew them from work", "NTA.\n\nBut I advise against it. With him being in law enforcement and living so close, he can make your life a living hell.", "My cats use up more than $50 a month in food and supplies to live. \n\nThe money is for your kids. If you or they currently don't need it, put it into their education fund for the future.\n\nNTA. But you need to pull your head out of your ass.", "NTA. It was dumb of you to not file for it in the first place.", "NTA. That money isn\u2019t yours. It belongs to your kids\u2014it\u2019s their healthier food, their better quality school clothes, their sports team fees. If all of that is already taken care of, it\u2019s their college funds. He\u2019s stealing from his own children and you\u2019ve been letting him. You no longer have any obligation to worry about his needs. He\u2019s a grown man. You do have an obligation to worry about theirs. Get them their money.", "NTA file for backdated support as well. Take every dollar the court will give you", "NTA. They\u2019re his kids too and since he shows such little interest in seeing them the least he can do is help financially support them. What an immature and selfish guy, I see why he\u2019s an ex.", "He\u2019s not and for what sounds like a number of years has not even paid the 50", "He owes HIS kids.", "OP is being dumb and manipulated, not an AH imo. It's a matter of intent", "In Texas, you can't get a driver's license if you owe.", "I live in Illinois he's had court order since 2004 but he lives in Nevada but hasn't paid anything and never been to jail and it's never really been forced to pay its just he will pay eventually", "My ex had an order for garnishment. EVERY time the court called them in to verify their employment, they would quit their job immediately. Then I had to start the process all over by figuring out where they work, notify the court again, just to have it happen all over again. This happened 15x. Yes, 15. And I was only awarded $100 a month. I received no payments from the time my child was 4 til they were 15 at which point I sent my child to live with my ex (And ended up being forced to pay $650 a month in support, because guess what, they quit their job AGAIN). The only upside was I didn't have to pay support for just under 2 yrs as the back pay was deducted from what I owed. I ended up disabled, my kid wasn't living with my ex any longer, I went to court to get the  child support stopped or at least decreased until my kid turned 18 and my ex not only quit their job again, but lied in court by saying my child was still living with them. I had to appeal the decision, and when the new court date came around, my ex was still unemployed and was still claiming my child lived with them. Unfortunately for my ex, the state had undeniable proof that my child was not living with them. I was awarded a payback of 9 months of child support. Guess what... It's been 12 yrs and I am still waiting for that money.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Illinois will issue a warrant for felony child support evasion once the amount surpasses $10,000.
