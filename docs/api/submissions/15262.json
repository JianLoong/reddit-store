It's not even like she was abusive to you either, you say she took care of you to the best of her abilities. \n\nGrow up and stop being a damn edgelord.

She was forced to work that much, she did not have the choice. No wonder she was upset when you consistently throw her hard work in her face. You have no empathy.

And typically, I WOULD say OP can't help what she feels.\n\nBut from what we're being told, the only thing Jodie did wrong was maybe not go to OP's events enough or spend more time with her. Otherwise, it sounds like it was more of a situation where her mother had to work more often than others because she was a single parent, but she always tried to provide and do enough for OP, which includes going on holidays, so it's not like OP never saw her mother.\n\nSo it does feel like OP is wrong with throwing away her mother at 13 just because her mother had to work more than others. \n\nAlso, I'm 100% side eyeing Bruce's mother/OP's MIL for telling OP AT A YOUNG AGE that she can call her mom. There was no reason for that woman to tell a pre-teen that she can call her mom.\n\nSo I don't know if OP is meaning to be an asshole but I think she kind of is. So I'll go with ~~Y T A~~ for right now.\n\nETA: I really had to think on this and I think it's more complicated than calling OP an asshole and a brat.

I just feel like it's more complicated and feelings are getting hurt on both sides.", "Soft YTA because honestly I think you need some therapy to work through your issues and you can't force yourself to feel like she's your mother and I feel like there is probably way more behind all this than you've said.

The chance to connect wasn't there.\nShe was pushed to the side and stayed there.\nThen, you (for your own valid reasons) pushed her further aside when you chose to call another woman \"mom.\"\nAnd she stayed there.\n\n2) giving a child a present is an easy way to make both parties happy. Sometimes, unfortunately, it is used instead of the effort needed to be present.\nBut it is also considered a love language by some. \nMaybe give your mother the benefit of the doubt about what and how she provided for you.\n\nAs a single, working mother I know my girl has way too many stuffies - and more than a few are bought because it takes away some guilt of not being the mom she wants sometimes (e.g. playing barbies and crafts)\n\nMaybe your perspective and understanding of motherhood will change after your own child.

Then she blasts her for doing what she needed with her second child like that she chose her brother over her. \n\nI think OP needs to hash this out for her, get perspective on her childhood and why this was like this.

Sometimes a parent's best isnt enough to form a strong emotional bond.\n\nPPD often has disastrous affects on parent-child bonding, which has been studied in-depth in many, many studies. Some studies have suggested that those impacts can persist into teen years or beyond. Again, I dont think this is Jodie's fault, but again, that doesnt negate how it influenced OP/their relationship.\n\nBruce's mom, bc she wasnt doings things like tucking OP in, was almost definitely providing the emotional support/exchange that Jodie lacked.

I think it\u2019s okay that she feels weird calling her \u201cfriend\u201d mom.", "She views Jodie more as a friend too. She didn\u2019t read her stories or go to plays. Playing \u201cMother\u201d is giving basic needs. Playing \u201cMom\u201d is doing that AND more. It\u2019s going to plays and dance recitals. It\u2019s reading stories before bed or helping with homework. That\u2019s mom.", "I do. Not having parents come to stuff like that hurts so bad. Mom is a term of endearment. Not everyone deserves to get called mom. Don\u2019t ever say something to me like that. I\u2019ve had real world problems that validate my claims. Mother and mom is different. Jodie was a mother, while bruce\u2019s mom was her \u201cMom.\u201d", "LOL. It was not for no reason. She explain that she never had a mom relationship with her.  You can't expect a kid to view you as mom when you are just acting like a friend and leaving all the parent stuff to someone else.", "Yeah I agree with that. It's clear OP is holding onto some resentment which may be exacerbated seeing her mother's new baby that is perhaps being doted on more than she was.", "I agree, it wasn't a nice thing to say.  But I'm not sure how I'd react if my mother's boyfriend ripped into me about our fractured relationship and what I called her. It is clear OP holds some resentment but honestly, so do I.  A lot of it isn't even against my mother, it's against society's pressure to love and cherish one's parents no matter what, to try to repair broken relationships and bla bla bla. It's hard to navigate without crushing your own feelings into a pit and just going along to get along.\n\nAnd I also fully agree that dads are held to a different standard.", "\nShe's not being selfish.\n\n>supportive\n\nMore like supported. Mom was there with presents and outings. Not emotional or mental support, OP was 13 when she stopped calling her mother mom and started calling someone else mom. The age that emotional and mental support is most needed, she turned to someone else. I mean come on? This line in the post says it all.\n\n<if I didn\u2019t like something she did? Waterworks, it was a lot.\n\nImagine trying to talk to your mom about your feelings and she just starts crying. I wouldn't talk to her.", "Yeah yikes that I actually care more about my hypothetical unborn kids than actually parents care about their real ones", "I also said adoption not just abortion", "Lucky is not the right word. And she sacrificed because she had to because she chose to have a kid. Again she chose it. OP did not.", "That's the law, you have a kid, keep the kid, you have to provide for it. Holy shit what a revelation.", "A good life full of material possessions and expensive outings. Such a good life.", "Sounds like she was stressed. The moms parents were pressuring her to pay for everything and then you have this kid who refuses to call you mom and criticizes you? I might cry too. She likely never felt like she was enough for anyone. And OP very coldly dismisses anything her mom did as \"friend\" which is so far off it's crazy. Bruce's mom likely did minimal support as a friend's mom might, but that diesnt mean OP shoulf have claimed her as a parent rather than a friend. OP needs some therapy, perhaps family therapy to deal with her issues about having a working mom,  but her actions don't make sense.", "You have a very restrictive, unforgiving and romanticized version of motherhood. How much do you think a single 19 mother can make in an hour? To pay for everything herself, I am surprised she ONLY had two jobs.", "I don't think a friend fulfills the role that OP's mom did. It's odd to relegate your parents to friend when they are the person who raised you and provided for you and tried to give you a good childhood.", "Again, you are not *emotionally mature* enough grasp the concept at play. I\u2019m not interested in further talking because you cannot establish nuance and only see the world in white and black. You will sooner or later have to acknowledge the gray area in life and deal with them instead of slapping a label on it.", "I know you are still a teenager and you don\u2019t currently have that life experience (and may never if you don\u2019t have kids). However, the basic needs sometimes is all that a parent can provide in a crappy situation like this one. \n\nOPs mother may not have been ever so present, but she did a lot for her in the situation she found herself. Often, with younger mothers, they are learning to grow up at the same time as their children. That means not always making the best decisions (which all parents do too). Makes for a more friend relationship vs a tradition parental role which we are seeing with her second child. \n\nYour opinion is valid, you are correct. But it is tainted by your life experience too. Just like for OP. She might eventually see things differently when she\u2019s the one in the hot seat and being judge for her parenting skills.", "She wasn't acting like a friend. She acted like a working parent.", "As many said is how she post it. Implying her mother wasn\u2019t a good parental figure cause she basically didn\u2019t have time to read her story and go to school play. She also call her mom until 13. And then go on and on and \u2018if she actually play mummy this time\u2019\nLet\u2019s be clear OP is 20 eh, she is not this seasoned woman in career with multiple children and time to work full time bring home the bacon and also \u2018play mummy\u2019.", "I'll adventure that you might be projecting a bit of your situation onto this one... \n\nAs someone who also grew up with a working mother who missed a lot of stuff because of work... It feels like she doesn't realize how hard it must have been for her mom. She's just pissed she didn't get a SAHM...", "Just as likely grandparents vetoed adoption....some people view that as bad as abortions. The point is don't assume what OPTIONS people have.", "That's nice of you.", "Lucky is the right word. A parent willing to work 2 jobs is a parent who loves and values and wants the best for you. We should all be so lucky.", "It\u2019s not a law. It has what has happened in this situation.", "Sound like it to me. To have a mother who goes above and beyond providing for me. To have a mother who would work 2 jobs just so I can have everything I want and need. Such a good life indeed.", "She could\u2019ve made an effort to even read her bed time stories. I\u2019m not saying demote her to \u201cbirth giver\u201d which is way worse then \u201cMother.\u201d Im saying OP feels weird to call her \u201cMom\u201d since she doesn\u2019t view her as \u201cMom.\u201d It\u2019s hard to call someone you don\u2019t view as mom or dad, mom/dad. It\u2019s not her fault she doesn\u2019t view her that way and calling people you don\u2019t view as a mom or dad \u201cMom\u201d or \u201cDad\u201d is super weird and it\u2019s fine to not call them that. Jodie did her best which is good, i\u2019m glad she tried. But she isn\u2019t mom, she\u2019s mother. Which is fine.", "I understand that. But she even says she sees her as a friend.

I think Jodie still is great for everything she did don\u2019t get me wrong. but OP thinks of her as a friend or a mother instead of a mom, which is fine. That\u2019s just my opinion of course.", "Okay thanks dude. Again, my opinion and i\u2019m very emotionally mature because of things i went through. I see everything in all colors and i won\u2019t speak to you any further. Thank you for your time and opinion, but i don\u2019t agree with you.", "I have a lot of life experiences actually. i went through a lot as a kid and had to grow up very quickly and actually raise some kids. I\u2019m not saying demote her to \u201cbirth giver\u201d because that\u2019s much worse then \u201cmother.\u201d I\u2019m just saying OP still recognizes her as friend and not Mom and that\u2019s okay. Mother and Mom are different and it\u2019s okay to think of your mother as your friend instead of mom.", "Oh I 100% am. But I think the core of the issue is the same and I have an understanding here that others may not - Jodie's doesn't feel like \"mom\" to OP, which is a feeling I very much understand. I understand how awkward and wrong it would feel to call someone \"mom\" when they aren't that to you. I can understand that it WAS hard for my mother (I am very aware that I was a burden) and that she did try her best, while still also not feeling like she is \"mom.\"", "She was 19, the grandparents couldn't stop her if she tried. She could literally leave.", "A constantly working parent that cries when you tell her something she doesn't like. So very lucky to have. She made money, wow such a good parent.

It\u2019s really be a mom reduced to how many time I will read to you? I think I stopped reading bed time stories at 6 to my kid cause they each started to read their own things. And I had a partner to decide responsibilities with.", "You and I have a lot in common. Unfortunately, parentification was also a big part of my childhood. I was a mature 16 year old too, \n\nHowever, as you age, situations change your perspective. Not trying to diminish your opinions here, just telling you that even at almost 40 I learn every day. Becoming a mom to my own kids and not those forced on me (that I adore with all my heart and are my first kids) did give me a different perspective though.", "I was talking about OP... It feels like she is resentful that her mother had to be the provider, which is the first job of any parent... I think she is being very unfair to her mother... She WAS a mother to her. I would bet that her grandparents push that narrative in some way.", "The same grandparents who made her pay rent, childcare, and banned her from moving for 4 years until she was 23?

Nothing important lol.", "What neglect?", "You know what OP needed? A house over her head, food to eat, clothes to wear. And bonus! Fun trips and outtings **her mother took her on**. Paid for by... You guessed it, her mother working 2 jobs.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that. But not coming to things like plays and recitals or whatever OP did hurts a child tremendously. She just wasn\u2019t there for her like mom and more so a friend. That\u2019s perfectly fine. What\u2019s not perfectly fine is you speaking to me this way. I don\u2019t want to speak to you if you continually treat me with disrespect. I\u2019ve tolerated this long enough.

My opinion stands. Thank you so much for talking to me about your opinion.", "Probably. I am sure it is a messy, complicated situation that is tough all around.\n\nBut I still don't think OP should have to call her mom if she doesn't want to, and that it was inappropriate for the husband to tear into her about it.

She could've left. Controlling behavior doesn't show up overnight. She did have options, the one she chose was just the easiest. The situation was what it was because of the mother not OP.
