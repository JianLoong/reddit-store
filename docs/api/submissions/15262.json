It's already hard enough for two parents to raise a kid, expecting perfect parenting from a single mother is unrealistic. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine the pain your mom went through when you stopped calling her mom and started calling someone else mom instead. And I can\u2019t possibly imagine how devastated she is right now after everything she\u2019s done to raise you without the proper support.

She was forced to work that much, she did not have the choice. No wonder she was upset when you consistently throw her hard work in her face. You have no empathy. I hope in time with your own child you realise how cruel you have been to your mum who as you admit sacrificed everything to support you.", "It's tough because I get OP feels how she feels and if she didn't feel like her mother was a mother, then something clearly went wrong along the way. And typically, I WOULD say OP can't help what she feels.\n\nBut from what we're being told, the only thing Jodie did wrong was maybe not go to OP's events enough or spend more time with her. Otherwise, it sounds like it was more of a situation where her mother had to work more often than others because she was a single parent, but she always tried to provide and do enough for OP, which includes going on holidays, so it's not like OP never saw her mother.\n\nSo it does feel like OP is wrong with throwing away her mother at 13 just because her mother had to work more than others. \n\nAlso, I'm 100% side eyeing Bruce's mother/OP's MIL for telling OP AT A YOUNG AGE that she can call her mom. There was no reason for that woman to tell a pre-teen that she can call her mom.\n\nSo I don't know if OP is meaning to be an asshole but I think she kind of is. So I'll go with ~~Y T A~~ for right now.\n\nETA: I really had to think on this and I think it's more complicated than calling OP an asshole and a brat. I think there are some other things at play (I'm still very much stuck on Bruce's mother telling OP to call her Mom at the age of 10), so I'm switching my vote to NAH.

I\u2019m like yeah she\u2019s sacrificed a lot, I\u2019m thankful but she had to? She got pregnant, and once again she wasn\u2019t the one who would read stories to me, who would come to my school plays etc she\u2019s just not my mum more like a friend \n\nI messaged Jodie saying I don\u2019t need the stress during my pregnancy, that she has my brother (2mo) to call her mum (if she actually plays mummy this time)\n\nHusband is actually on my mums side, some friends think I\u2019m TA\u2026I think I can\u2019t control my feelings? And she had 7 years to say something!\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think you should just call her mom to her face.", "NAH. It sounds like Jodie did all she could to take care and provide for you like a mother should, even if she wasn\u2019t particularly \"mom-like\". You should be grateful for that. At the same time, emotional bonds are complicated, and if you do not see her as a mother, you should not be forcing yourself to call her \"mum\". You can't force feelings.

I don't feel bad for you because she missed your plays, she was working it's not like she was out at the club shooting up. Even when you rejected her as a mother she was just grateful to have you accept her in your life. She didn't say anything and probably wasn't going to but I'm glad her husband said something. After everything she did for you she wasn't playing mom she was being a great mom! She did more than most moms I know that are way older than she was.

But this time it takes the price.\nIf the roles were reversed.

Don't feel bad at all, she's not your mom, she's your mother. Just because she bought you stuff and brought you cool places doesn't earn her the title of mom. And I've seen a couple times \"she could've put you up for adoption or gotten an abortion.\"  She could've, it's completely her choice but she didn't she chose to do it the way she did. She gets to deal with the consequences.", "NTA. This stuff is complicated and there is no solid answer that will make everyone happy. You have a decent if distant relationship with Jodie and it sounds like you were willing to have her part of your baby's life. Call her what feels right to you and hopefully she can make it work. One question, do you feel comfortable letting your baby call her grandmum or Nana etc? That may be the middle path.", "NTA\n\nI know how you feel. I do call my mother \u201cmom\u201d but I usually say it in a weird way like \u201cmaaaa\u201d because it feels weird to call her mom. During my formative years, she was a severe alcoholic, and in my teen years she basically disappeared. Over this time, we lost those motherly bonds and although she\u2019s back on my life now, she in no way fills the role of a mother, nor do I want her to. \n\nThe only factor worth considering is how you want your baby to view Jodie. The kid will be fine either way, but if you wanted to, you might to consider a new term that\u2019s between \u201cmommy dearest\u201d and \u201cJodie that lady over there.\u201d Like \u201cma Jodie\u201d or something. But totally up to you - kids are adaptable and this will be normal to them.", "NTA. Im not sure if Jodie is either. Sounds like she made the best out of a shitty situation and didnt have the tools required to be mom, yet it doesnt sound like she was mean or abusive either. How you feel about it is understandable and its also understandable that her feelings are hurt. Her husband however is def an AH. Its not his place to butt into your relationship with Jodie. Thats for you two to sort out.", "NTA - I don\u2019t agree with majority of the responses here. You mum had a choice to have you or not, she chose to have you. She found out the hard way it\u2019s really difficult to raise a child, she tried but from you\u2019re saying the bond was missing and that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to go into why it\u2019s missing, the fact remains it was missing and you don\u2019t feel like calling her mum and that\u2019s absolutely fine.", "NTA, honestly I\u2019m trying to figure out what she thought would happen when she had a child young? Was everyone supposed to just fix it all for her. I say that as someone who had a kid at 21. \n\nIt was no one\u2019s job to care for you and pay for your needs except hers. Child support is a thing and she chose not to pursue it based on what\u2019s here. \n\nHer parents criteria for her to move out was that she would be stable? That is not a high bar to meet. That\u2019s them ensuring your needs are being met by your mom. \n\nYou\u2019re 20, and she\u2019s 39, her job was to get her shit together at some point in the last 20 years and actually parent you. She hasn\u2019t and that\u2019s on her. Of course you don\u2019t view her as a mom, she hasn\u2019t acted as one. Same as people who have absentee fathers who pay for stuff but don\u2019t actually do the caregiving of a parent don\u2019t view their bio fathers as a dad. \n\nMom or Dad are the people who mold you into the person you are, they\u2019re your caregivers, they teach your right from wrong, and support you as much as they\u2019re able to. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s out in the work to earn that title. And her \u201csacrifices\u201d are doing the bare minimum required to legally raise a child do not mean she is entitled to anything.", "NTA. You don\u2019t see her as mom. Being a mom and a mother is different and you just don\u2019t see her like that. It\u2019s okay to feel weird about calling her mom and you don\u2019t have too. Congrats on the baby too! I hope the baby is beautiful and healthy :) (Sorry i deleted my comment, i thought i actually posted it into the thread as a post instead of a comment)", "NTA- she is just wanting the title for 'looks' around your child.   Growing up I know my own mum would call her MIL Nana, because that is what us kids called her.  Maybe you could do the same as a compromise? Call her grandma Jodie or whatever your kid will be calling her.\n\nMum/mom title is earned not demanded.", "NTA - there was enough time for your mother to build a proper mother-Children relationship. Its not your fault, that she was single mother and had a hard time. Raising a kid is not the same as loving a kid. Parents can not demand the love of their children if they did not give love in the first place", "NTA. Everyone here saying y t a needs to understand what emotional neglect is and how that effects children and later as adults. You do not need to call someone mom if you don\u2019t want to.", "Nta but man, pls less cruel next time", "NTA\n\nYou feel the way you feel. You've had years to think about how you feel. YOU were in the situation, we weren't. A 'birth giver' does not have to be negligent for someone to think of her as a friend instead of a mother.\n\nThe only other thing I will add is: once you are older and will be a mom yourself, your feelings about your growing up years may change. Your feelings towards your 'birth giver' may change. Maybe they won't, but your perspective may change. That's okay; that's normal.", "NTA-She wants the attention of being mum without putting work into a relationship that would make her mum.", "NTA, the other commenters I think are privileged in having good bond with their mothers, so they don't understand. You can't force someone to see you as a parent, either they do or don't. It's clear to me that your mom was too busy working to facilitate that bond, so you found it with a new mom. \n\nI had a similar experience; growing up, I learned not to take my mom's advice because it never worked. She always wanted me to do more than I felt comfortable, pushing me academically while not teaching me or getting me a tutor when i needed extra help. So I ended up talking to my grandma more, and she feels more like a mother than my mom ever will. My mom was a workaholic as well, and I was closer to my dad, but then he left when I was ten. My mom was my only parent, but she never parented. She gave me and my brother a room, stuff, and frozen dinners, and when she came home from work, she would lock herself in her room, with a bottle of vodka, until the next morning. She is my mom, but she didn't parent me, so I don't see her as a mother.", "NTA.  You can't make someone feel something they don't.

She was a single teen mom with awful, controlling parents who worked two jobs and STILL showed up to her child's events. She struggled with PPD for years given her lack of support from not only her parents, but the terrible community members like Bruce's judgmental mother who didn't \"believe\" she was depressed and poisoned her child's mind into calling her mother. \n\nAnd even when her daughter started calling a different person mother, she didn't freak out or abuse her, she gave the teenager space and tried to be understanding. \n\nNow her adult daughter ignores her messages to the point 50 of them are stacked up.

PPD has a genetic component. You're at very high risk for it, and you've surrounded yourself with people who dismiss How severe and long-lasting that condition is. Your \"mom\" has already stated she doesn't believe in that issue, and your grandparents already failed someone in that situation. \n\nDon't be surprised if Bruce's mother swoops in and starts having your child call her mom instead of Grandma. You don't truly understand how malicious that action was until it happens to you. \n\nThat woman saw a struggling young mother, working two jobs, providing everything her daughter needed, still showing up to her child's events, and swooped in during her daughter's teenage years where a lot of kids feel disconnected from their parents. \n\nIt wasn't uncommon for you to feel disconnected at that age as you were finding yourself, It is uncommon for another person to swoop in to fill the mom roll, by literally doing nothing to provider or take care of you.\n\nIt sounds like this woman conditioned you to sever your ties to your own mother so you could be fully indoctrinated into their family, and she wouldn't have to compete for \"Grandma\", holidays, etc. Bruce's mom sounds awful.\n\n#Jodie 4life", "YTA wow you truly hate the woman who wasted her entire youth on you don't you", "YTA.

That\u2019s awful and I feel for you both. You should really explore therapy to deal with that trauma as should your mother.\n\n2. Bruce\u2019s mom disapproved of your mother being so young. I can only assume that she openly criticized her when you were young and suspect she had a hand in your perception of your mother. \n\n3. Since you stated you stopped calling her mum when you were 13, 7 years ago. That puts you at about 20. You are still young and developing yourself.\n\n4. Was your mother perfect? No, none of us are.

It does sound like your mom was doing her best but being a young, single mother is a difficult path.\n\nYour mother and you were both being abused and manipulated by the adults around you. You need to seek therapy to unpack and process your trauma.

People are roasting you in here. NTA. It sounds like you experienced childhood emotional neglect and that can have lasting effects. It's a lot to unpack because while your mom provided for you physically, there was no sense of closeness or connection which is all a child really wants with their parents. Without connection, you feel all alone, you feel isolated, you feel sad and you feel abandoned.  When we're little, connection is our BIGGEST need. Your feelings are absolutely valid. I get why others would call you spiteful, but they don't understand the emotional hurt and pain your mother caused. Granted, you can rationally understand that she was still a kid when she had you, however that understanding doesn't take away the emotional pain of neglect or not feeling like your Mom was interested in who you are. If you love someone, their feelings and thoughts should matter to you and it sounds like your feelings/thoughts didn't matter to her which is painful. So, there is going to be a lot of resentment there. Since you're going to be a new Mom, I would look into attachment theory and what your attachment style is and follow Eli Harwood on IG (attachmentnerd). I'm sorry you're getting roasted here. It sounds like some therapy might help you start your healing journey. Good luck :)", "NTA. Kicking your daughter out doesn\u2019t let you keep the Mom title. PPD plus those jobs easily leads to emotional neglect, and it\u2019s common for teen moms to have a \u201cfriend\u201d relationship with their child for lack of a real support system.

You can't change that unless you both decide to really work on it.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, it's heart breaking that you were so desperate for a mum that you latched onto a friend's mum to get that. You clearly weren't given the love and care that you needed. Again, I can see how your mum's own issues explains it, and I feel bad for her. But it doesn't make it OK.

I also have not had the luck of having a father close to me. We have very similar circumstances of life.  And let me tell you this, \"she didn't had to\" she could've left you somewhere like an orphanage or on the streets. Instead she sacrificed her twenties which is basically the best span of \"our\" lives to raise you. Instead of being grateful, you are there being a spiteful little kid. I can understand being deluded that your mom couldn't get into plays, mine couldn't either but at the same time you should understand that if she hadn't worked you probably wouldn't have an house anymore.  \n\n\nNot going along with your parents happens, but you should still be grateful and respect them nonetheless.", "I am not going to be as harsh on you as everyone else.

I can also understand how hard it is to be your mother's constant therapist- that's hard and it's why I am not talking to my mother right now.  I wouldn't  call you the Asshole but I think you are placing your blame on the wrong person. I think you will benefit taking a step back and maybe seeing if you can talk to a therapist. Get some Clarity. However, I suggest you give your mom another chance. She respected your boundaries, it was the husband who gave you the \"stresser\" and it's your Grandparents that kicked you our (which you never actually listed why-).

And you admit a lot of this is what you were \"told\".  I'm assuming by your grandparents... who probably aren't the most objective people to get this story from.  They were charging their teenage daughter enough in rent and childcare that she had to have TWO full time jobs and refusing to let her leave until she proved to their satisfaction she was financially stable... was she supposed to get a 3rd job to save for that?  How exactly was she supposed to have time to tuck you in every night and go to school functions?  I think you need to actually sit down with your mom and get HER side of all of this before you treat her like she never cared.  \n\nMy mother, bless her scatter-brained heart, never remembers my birthday.

(new to reddit, hope I'm clear)\nWhy do you say 'a huge FEELING of emotional neglect'? To me it looks like emotional neglect and by calling it a feeling it feels like her experience is downplayed. \nAlso, why doesn't emotional neglect count as failing as a mother? I can say from experience that emotional neglect can severly scar a person (I have been struggling with depression for over ten years and have no longer contact with biological dad). Also, being a single mother doesn't mean that you can't be emotionally available and that the child should feel the pressure of keeping the mom happy. I had a great single mom, both worked hard and emotionally available (but I can understand that it is harder in US compared to Europe, since giving birth in US already gives you debt until after the afterlife).\nI completely understand that the mother is a victim too in this situation and I recognize that she worked very hard. However, I feel like that's not a reason to minimize the feelings of OP. I don't understand the relationship with MIL deeply enough to be able to say anything about calling MIL 'mom' since 10. But it has already been several years since she called Jodie mom and she's only adressing it now that OP's pregnant. I understand that she wants to be a part of this baby's life, but maybe they should start with speaking to each other more often (since it has been 3 months) and rebuild their relationship, if both parties agree. I feel that OP's just protecting her boundaries, and I don't see something wrong in that.\nAbout presents as love language, emotional availability can't be replaced by presents in my opinion, but maybe it works for others. \nI really do not mean to offend anyone, I just do not understand why everyone is this harsh on OP. Could she have done things differently, yes. But Jodie could've as well. Both are victims of grandparents, both are allowed to have feelings about it.
