And typically, I WOULD say OP can't help what she feels.\n\nBut from what we're being told, the only thing Jodie did wrong was maybe not go to OP's events enough or spend more time with her. Otherwise, it sounds like it was more of a situation where her mother had to work more often than others because she was a single parent, but she always tried to provide and do enough for OP, which includes going on holidays, so it's not like OP never saw her mother.\n\nSo it does feel like OP is wrong with throwing away her mother at 13 just because her mother had to work more than others. \n\nAlso, I'm 100% side eyeing Bruce's mother/OP's MIL for telling OP AT A YOUNG AGE that she can call her mom. There was no reason for that woman to tell a pre-teen that she can call her mom.\n\nSo I don't know if OP is meaning to be an asshole but I think she kind of is. So I'll go with ~~Y T A~~ for right now.\n\nETA: I really had to think on this and I think it's more complicated than calling OP an asshole and a brat.

Then she blasts her for doing what she needed with her second child like that she chose her brother over her. \n\nI think OP needs to hash this out for her, get perspective on her childhood and why this was like this.

Sometimes a parent's best isnt enough to form a strong emotional bond.\n\nPPD often has disastrous affects on parent-child bonding, which has been studied in-depth in many, many studies. Some studies have suggested that those impacts can persist into teen years or beyond. Again, I dont think this is Jodie's fault, but again, that doesnt negate how it influenced OP/their relationship.\n\nBruce's mom, bc she wasnt doings things like tucking OP in, was almost definitely providing the emotional support/exchange that Jodie lacked.

She was a single teen mom with awful, controlling parents who worked two jobs and STILL showed up to her child's events. She struggled with PPD for years given her lack of support from not only her parents, but the terrible community members like Bruce's judgmental mother who didn't \"believe\" she was depressed and poisoned her child's mind into calling her mother. \n\nAnd even when her daughter started calling a different person mother, she didn't freak out or abuse her, she gave the teenager space and tried to be understanding. \n\nNow her adult daughter ignores her messages to the point 50 of them are stacked up. And she tries reaching out once her daughter is pregnant to try to heal some of the issues they've had over the years, only for her daughter to be just the worst. \n\nYOU do not deserve Jodie. \n\nAlso you're in for a quite awful wake up call after you give birth. PPD has a genetic component. You're at very high risk for it, and you've surrounded yourself with people who dismiss How severe and long-lasting that condition is. Your \"mom\" has already stated she doesn't believe in that issue, and your grandparents already failed someone in that situation. \n\nDon't be surprised if Bruce's mother swoops in and starts having your child call her mom instead of Grandma. You don't truly understand how malicious that action was until it happens to you. \n\nThat woman saw a struggling young mother, working two jobs, providing everything her daughter needed, still showing up to her child's events, and swooped in during her daughter's teenage years where a lot of kids feel disconnected from their parents. \n\nIt wasn't uncommon for you to feel disconnected at that age as you were finding yourself, It is uncommon for another person to swoop in to fill the mom roll, by literally doing nothing to provider or take care of you.\n\nIt sounds like this woman conditioned you to sever your ties to your own mother so you could be fully indoctrinated into their family, and she wouldn't have to compete for \"Grandma\", holidays, etc. Bruce's mom sounds awful.\n\n#Jodie 4life", "YTA wow you truly hate the woman who wasted her entire youth on you don't you", "YTA. I read all of your responses and here\u2019s my reasoning.\n\n1. Your description of your grandparents sounds like they were incredibly abusive to both you and your mother. That\u2019s awful and I feel for you both. You should really explore therapy to deal with that trauma as should your mother.\n\n2. Bruce\u2019s mom disapproved of your mother being so young. I can only assume that she openly criticized her when you were young and suspect she had a hand in your perception of your mother. \n\n3. Since you stated you stopped calling her mum when you were 13, 7 years ago. That puts you at about 20. You are still young and developing yourself.\n\n4. Was your mother perfect? No, none of us are. We do what we think is best at the time and sometimes we fall short. It does sound like your mom was doing her best but being a young, single mother is a difficult path.\n\nYour mother and you were both being abused and manipulated by the adults around you. You need to seek therapy to unpack and process your trauma.

People are roasting you in here. NTA. It sounds like you experienced childhood emotional neglect and that can have lasting effects. It's a lot to unpack because while your mom provided for you physically, there was no sense of closeness or connection which is all a child really wants with their parents. Without connection, you feel all alone, you feel isolated, you feel sad and you feel abandoned.  When we're little, connection is our BIGGEST need. Your feelings are absolutely valid. I get why others would call you spiteful, but they don't understand the emotional hurt and pain your mother caused. Granted, you can rationally understand that she was still a kid when she had you, however that understanding doesn't take away the emotional pain of neglect or not feeling like your Mom was interested in who you are. If you love someone, their feelings and thoughts should matter to you and it sounds like your feelings/thoughts didn't matter to her which is painful. So, there is going to be a lot of resentment there. Since you're going to be a new Mom, I would look into attachment theory and what your attachment style is and follow Eli Harwood on IG (attachmentnerd). I'm sorry you're getting roasted here. It sounds like some therapy might help you start your healing journey. Good luck :)", "NTA. Kicking your daughter out doesn\u2019t let you keep the Mom title. PPD plus those jobs easily leads to emotional neglect, and it\u2019s common for teen moms to have a \u201cfriend\u201d relationship with their child for lack of a real support system. Your feelings are real, and your relationships are your decision. Therapy to talk these things out is still reasonable whether you decide to reconcile or not.", "NAH except maybe your grandparents. Your mum clearly had issues which stopped her from giving you the emotional stability you needed, and I feel sorry for her. But understanding it doesn't change your relationship or the fact that you don't see her as a parent.

It's a sad situation for both of you, but the bottom line is, the way you feel about her was shaped by the way she has treated you. You can't change that unless you both decide to really work on it.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, it's heart breaking that you were so desperate for a mum that you latched onto a friend's mum to get that. You clearly weren't given the love and care that you needed. Again, I can see how your mum's own issues explains it, and I feel bad for her. But it doesn't make it OK. It wasn't OK either for her to let your grandparents kick you out at 16.", "I don't comment usually.

I also have not had the luck of having a father close to me. We have very similar circumstances of life.  And let me tell you this, \"she didn't had to\" she could've left you somewhere like an orphanage or on the streets. Instead she sacrificed her twenties which is basically the best span of \"our\" lives to raise you. Instead of being grateful, you are there being a spiteful little kid. I can understand being deluded that your mom couldn't get into plays, mine couldn't either but at the same time you should understand that if she hadn't worked you probably wouldn't have an house anymore.  \n\n\nNot going along with your parents happens, but you should still be grateful and respect them nonetheless.", "I am not going to be as harsh on you as everyone else. It sounds like your Grandparents are to blame not your mom, I know you didn't  ask to be born but your mom really tried. I can also understand how hard it is to be your mother's constant therapist- that's hard and it's why I am not talking to my mother right now.  I wouldn't  call you the Asshole but I think you are placing your blame on the wrong person. I think you will benefit taking a step back and maybe seeing if you can talk to a therapist. Get some Clarity. However, I suggest you give your mom another chance. She respected your boundaries, it was the husband who gave you the \"stresser\" and it's your Grandparents that kicked you our (which you never actually listed why-).
