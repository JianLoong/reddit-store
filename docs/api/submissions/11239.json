I'm a content creator and don't leave my house much, she's a recently graduated nurse. We met in HS and just hit it off. She texted me last week asking if I wanted to ride with her to said city. I didn't have anything to do so I told her sure!\n\nWe live about 5 minutes away from each other. She drove and since we got there early I helped her prepare. About 10 minutes later she went to her interview and I sat in the car. I didn't know the place so I just took a nap in the car (it was off) then got on my phone. Her interview took about 45- 50 minutes give or take. Afterwards we went to a museum and downtown all about 5-10 minutes from the job interview. After that we then began driving back home. She stopped on the way home to get gas. Now here's where I may be the AH. She looked at me and extended her hand. She said \" I paid for the gas here. You have to pay for it on the way back.\" I was confused and legit thought she was joking so I gave her a high-five and laughed. She crossed her arms. I told her \" I came as a friend. There was literally nothing there for me. \" After all she wanted to go to the museum but not alone. She wasn't happy before rolling her eyes. I thought it was done but then about 10 minutes from home she stopped at a Chick-fil-A and insisted I pay saying \"It was the decent thing to do.\". I am someone who also rarely ever eats out but this time again I laughed. She wasn't happy and said I had to pay otherwise I was walking home. I shook my head and just got out. I knew my way home so just I left. \n\nShe told her parents and other friends and they've been saying I should have just paid since I went it was only fair.

There is no expectation, generally, that when you accompany someone on an errand that you pay for half of gas or food. If she wants to deviate from that baseline expectation, she needs to make that clear beforehand. It's not fair for her to hit you with her hidden contract in the middle of the trip.", "NTA\n\n\"She texted me last week asking if I wanted to ride with her to said city. I didn't have anything to do so I told her sure!\"\n\nYou didn't ask to go. She invited you. You don't owe her anything. In fact, you did he a favor because it seems she didn't want to go alone. She wants to be paid for you doing her a favor...? \n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe invited you on a trip. You didn\u2019t plan one together. If she wanted to split the expenses she should\u2019ve communicated that to you when asking you. \n\nShe just wanted someone to pay for half the gas and food so she invited you.", "NTA. if she wanted you to pay for gas and food she should have asked before y\u2019all left. that\u2019s not something you spring on to someone after they\u2019re in the car", "NTA This doesn't sound like it was a girl's outting. This was a trip for an interview. It sounds like she didn't want to drive in alone which is why she asked you to come and then acts like she's doing you a favour expecting compensation for it.", "The trip doesn't sound like it benefited you in any way. And if that's the case then you shouldn't have to pay for anything. If anything, she should have paid for you since she seems to have needed the company.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd telling on you to her parents and friends (to try and guilt/shame you)? That makes her an even bigger a-hole.", "NTA. You went with your friend to keep her company, and it seems like she did not communicate her expectation for you to split expenses beforehand. While it is common courtesy to offer to split expenses when going on a trip with someone, it is not fair for her to suddenly demand that you pay for things without prior agreement.\n\nFurthermore, it sounds like you went with her out of kindness and did not have any specific reason or benefit for yourself, so her request seems even more unreasonable. It is understandable that you were taken aback and confused by her sudden demands.\n\nIt may be worth discussing clear expectations for future trips or outings with your friend to avoid similar misunderstandings in the future.", "NTA. It was crappy of your friend to invite you along, without asking you ahead of time to chip in, then turn around and demand gas grass or ass. Standard practice is when somebody invites you to a thing, it's understood that they're offering to pay. When she realized that you didn't understand her expectations, she should have apologized for the glitch in communication that was all on her.", "NTA at all. I can understand if this was a trip you wanted to take together, but she would have had to take this trip anyway for the interview! She already would have had to pay for both ways", "NTA; she invited YOU, and the inviter usually pays. If she had different expectations she should have articulated that up front.", "NTA\n\nIf she wanted to split the bills with you, that should have been a conversation before you left, not while you are already trapped there.", "No way, your friend is the AH. They invited you to keep them company!", "NTA . It sounds like she wanted a companion for the trip so she wouldn't be alone. She didn't communicate in advance she wanted to split cost. Also she would have had the costs regardless of if you accompanied her or not. \n\nIt would be a different story if she asked you out for a nice day out and didn't have a mandatory interview.", "NTA. I don't understand your friend's thought process! She was going to drive the 3-hour trip and pay for gas there and back regardless if you were there or not. You went to a museum that she wanted to go to. You ate and you each should pay for your own food. The only thing I can think of is that she was just trying to use you to help mitigate the costs with a side bonus of having company for an all-day trip she had to make. **If** she had asked for help with gas ahead of time, and you agreed, that would've been fine.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ask her to take you somewhere, she asked you to go with her someplace she was already going.", "NTA. She would have used that gas to get to and from anyways for that interview. She was the one that was hungry.\n\nAlso, who the he'll invites someone out and then says \"btw you owe me gas money now because we came here together.\"?", "NTA\n\nShe's not your friend, she only asked you to get some gas money out of you. She asked YOU to come with her, not the other way around. You don't owe her anything. All of this was unfair to you", "NTA", "She invited you not you asking to go! No you are NOT TA if it was your idea then maybe but I wouldn\u2019t have paid for my friends gas or food personally \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Sounds like she only invited you so that her fuel costs would be halved.", "NTA. You don\u2019t invite someone then expect them to pay! If that was her expectation, she should have told you straight up, not put it down to \u201cfairness\u201d!", "NTA you tagged along to something she was going to do without you. Shes just trying to manipulate you so she can half the cost of her petrol. Yikes.", "NTA If you had asked her for the ride to your interview in town, then you should have paid for both gas and food IMO, but it sounds like she wanted emotional support and you went with her for that.", "She asked you to go to cut her costs. She planned this. NTA", "Ew NTA. She could have discussed ahead of time and said she wanted to invite you to split gas or something. Maybe you'd still want to go but she invited you just to tag along...wtf.", "Technically NTA. If she was expecting you to share expenses, she should have said so up front. Then you could have made an informed decision.\n\nThat said, if you want to keep enjoying road trips with friends, be prepared to share some of the expenses. I would never consider going on a road trip with a friend, even in the situation you describe, without offering to chip in for gas or pay for some of the snacks. It's just polite and sharing the burden makes it easier for everyone, which means more fun trips and getting invited along.", "Probably not a very good friend but technically NTA. If my friend does something nice for me like invite me a on a quick daytrip to a city that is fun I would do something nice in return like buy them dinner. But you're under no obligation to.", "If I were you I would have offered to chip in for gas, but she shouldn\u2019t have asked since it was a work trip she had to pay for anyway. She was wrong to ask you to buy her food, unless she paid for earlier meals. All meals and museum tickets should have been dutch.", "Eh, NTA since the expectation wasn't set up front. I might have offered a few bucks for gas in your position HAD SHE NOT DEMANDED you pay first. That was tacky on her part.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Without a clear understanding of expectations, it's unfair to assume that one person is responsible for a certain expense. In addition, it was the driver's choice to stop at the museum and downtown area, so it's not necessarily the passenger's responsibility to pay for those activities.

In fact, I would buy them dinner to say thanks. If we plan that trip together because we both have a reason to go, then we split the gas regardless of who drives.

We\u2019ve been friends for a while and one of the few I have left from high school and I honestly was starting to feel bad after her folks texted me but this helps a lot.

But there is no reason you should have to pay for her food(again, her food would have cost the same if you were there or not).", "If she invited you because she wanted you to subsidize her interview trip (which is rude I think) she needed to say that upfront so you can decide if you want to agree to that. You were under the impression she wanted company. I think you were very nice to wait in the car for her while she interviewed. \n\nNTA. I'm sorry that friendship is off but it's probably for the best in the long run especially as she stopped at a restaurant to try to get you to pay and then made you walk the rest of the way home.", "NTA\nShe would have had to pay for the gas and food regardless if you went or not.

NTA. At one point my husband who was living in a city 4 hours away hurt his back and i had to go pick him up from emergency, my friends offered to come with me and bring back his car and help me stay awake.
