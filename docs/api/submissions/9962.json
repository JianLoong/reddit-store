If he confronts you about not eating it just say \"no it was very thoughtful, I'm just not in the mood for sweets right now\" and again leave it uneaten where he can see it, for days until it dries up and goes bad.  \n\nThis happens a few times and he'll stop buying them for you.", "NTA\n\nJust tell him that it\u2019s not a gift at all.

Maybe you can introduce a different live language to him. Maybe giving you sweets is his?\n\nBut, also, I think you might be on your way out the door of this relationship. The way you talk about why he is doing it seems like you want to paint him in a bad light. I can be wrong though.\n\nJust ask yourself if you are still attracted to him exactly how he is right now. Not what he used to be and not what he could be. Maybe he likes his body the way it is? There are people out there who love their bigger bodies, me included!

Can I say that someone is wrong without specifically saying they\u2019re an asshole?     \n      \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, he should\u2019ve listened to you and he shouldn\u2019t have acted out when confronted - but he\u2019s human, and humans are problematic.

And it\u2019s not just her, I frequently forget things everyone tells me. I have to organize my life around spreadsheets and reminder apps or I just flounder. It frustrates the shit out of my wife (and most people, probably), and when she confronts me sometimes I get defensive. It\u2019s possible that he thought you\u2019d like it and felt defensive about forgetting or not remembering and acted poorly.        \n          \nNow, if he intentionally got it to keep you off your diet because he\u2019s jealous, that\u2019s different, but I find that assuming motive leads to more arguments than are really helpful.        \n      \nHave you asked him if he forgot, or why he won\u2019t join you on this?

He is projecting his fears that you will move on or away from him as you become healthier, so his way of dealing with it, is to put up obstacles to keep you \"stuck\" at a higher unhealthy weight.

This needs to be a sit down discussion between the two of you to determine a way forward.", "NTA.  He could have gotten you a card, flowers or something else, but he chose the one thing you had told him repeatedly you did not want.  Instead of calling his gift self-serving, you need to ask him why he is actively trying to sabotage you.  If it is coming from his insecurity, he needs to deal with it.  He also needs to learn no means no.", "NTA Don't apologise to him. You need to find out how long he's willing to sulk and try to punish you with vague unpleasantness before he apologises. (If he apologises) I feel like this will be important information on whether you stay with him or break up.\n\nYou have two issues going on here - \n\n1. he didn't listen to you about the cupcakes and other unhealthy snacks. \n2. he's sulking instead of apologising or letting it go or smoothing it over.\n\nI have more of a problem with 2, tbh. That's the kind of assholery that destroys friendships and relationships. \n\nPeople make mistakes, but people also need to take responsibility, be able to apologise, and be able to deal with their own emotions without sulking, slamming and stomping around, and snapping at other people.

Let me guess. He ate the cupcakes that you didn't want? Your BF is definitely the AH here. You were not in any way unclear that you didn't want what he ended up getting you.", "NTA - This is just down right disrespectful.   You've asked and fully explained why you didn't want sweets and he disregard you.   Its 2023 who does that these days?", "NTA. You\u2019ve been very clear of what you don\u2019t like, and you told him multiple times, he can\u2019t get upset because he refuses to listen to you.

That kind of controlling behaviour is far more serious than a Valentine cupcake.\n\nIf you're blowing this up for no reason and he's just a poor gift-chooser, then a Valentine cupcake shouldn't destroy you so much.
