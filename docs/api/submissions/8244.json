I wouldn't care if they wanted me to call my grandbaby rutabaga, as long as I got to cuddle them!", "NTA. Your FIL is punishing your newborn over a name. That\u2019s what\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\nAlso, I love that you blended your last names and think that\u2019s really beautiful. I really hope your FIL comes around. Hang in there!", "NTA.\n\nI rather like your idea of a blended last name to represent both families that came together to form a new family. Maybe not for everyone, obviously, but pretty cool for those who would want to.\n\nYour father in law sounds pretty pathetic and very demanding.  Not sure I'd be too eager to do anything that would suggest to him I'd want him in my child's life - I only like positive role models around my child.", "Definitely NTA. You guys aren\u2019t being unreasonable, just unconventional.\n\nI agree that names matter, and obviously you and your husband do too, which is why you very consciously chose the name you did. If your genders were reversed and you were the husband, keeping with tradition, this baby would be a Johnson. How would grandpa feel then? It\u2019s just silly. I understand he probably had an expectation and that expectation hasn\u2019t aligned with reality, that can be difficult to accept but it\u2019s on him to get over the butthurt. He\u2019s acting like a child and he\u2019s only hurting himself with this tantrum.", "NTA it's just a name at the end of the day, no idea why people get funny about this stuff.

I don\u2019t get it and I think it belongs in the past. I love the idea of the new blended name for the whole family, and your names lend themselves to a very normal, everyday surname. \n\nPlease don\u2019t cave. I think it\u2019s awesome!", "It looks like your the one that had an issue with the surnames and you husband just went along with whatever you wanted.\nIf your husband wanted to keep his surname would you have been ok with that.", "NTA. Great compromise on the names. Grandpa just needs to accepts it's not Middle Ages anymore.", "Hard NTA. Of course you're not. You seem to have a nightmare of a FIL.", "NTA. They're your names to change and you child is also yours. FIL is coming from an antiquated idea system. My father was upset for a long time that my brother didn't want children, because no one would carry on the family name.", "NTA - You're adults, you are allowed to name yourself and your kids whatever you want. Your FIL demanding not to change your name is overstepping immensely. Don't give into him, keep the name. Personally I think the idea kind of rocks.", " NTA. If FIL wants to be petty because you are not reinforcing the patriarchy, let him. He\u2019s the one who will be missing out on the grandchild.", "N T A - your FIL is!", "NTA. I might understand your FIL's point of view if his last name was very unusual/rare, but otherwise I see no problem with what you did.", "NTA. 33M here. I definately agree with yalls perspective on names and gender. Im willing to take my future wifes name. I think I know why the father has a problem. Partly cause thats tradition (not a good excuse) but the other is to represent the family line. My first and middle represent several people in my family and I am proud of that. That being said the name isn't the only thing that represents, remembers, or recognizes the family line. There is 100% nothing wrong with having a different name from everyone.i am glad the kid's new name worked out to being failry easy to say/spell and remember cause names can give people hell. The harder the name the more people are going to do nock names. Is that fair, no but thats what happens whether they like it or not. I have an Ethiopian friend and I have a hard time pronouncing it, I do not give him any name thats different than the one he gave me but he started accepting the difficulty and is fine with a nick name.", "NTA.

YTA. You forfeited an entire legacy and family history to make your own tradition, of course he\u2019s going to feel betrayed, until recently the longevity of a surname was something to be massively proud of, something passed on.\n\nAdding: The fact that you want the same last name as your son only proves the point that a name is sacred to a family.", "NTA\n\n Seems like kind of stupid to me to grow to all that trouble just so that you can say you're different than others, but it's your child so you chose.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mom hyphenated her name when she married my stepfather, but gave my little brother the steps name, which he kept as original.  That being said, if I were his father, he'd be dead to me as well.  I have names in my family that go back over hundreds of years, and they mean something, and as for the family name, my ancestors earned that name and to cast it aside he definitely would be dead to us as a family.", "NTA maybe it\u2019s for the best that he isn\u2019t around the child seeing as he\u2019s full of it.

My husband didn\u2019t like growing up with a name different from his mother. My husband is also a feminist and believes in equality. He doesn\u2019t think the system most societies have for last names is fair to women. Neither do I. One of the many reasons we got married is because we share a lot of similar beliefs and ideologies. We both wanted a shared name. We considered hyphenating but my husband\u2019s friends with hyphenated last names advised us against that because they hated it growing up. This was a joint decision that was made over the course of years.", "I didn\u2019t include this information in the original post but we DID continue a family tradition that was meaningful to us.
