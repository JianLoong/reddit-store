All I need to do is fill in some paperwork, pay the fee and off I go. \n\nThere\u2019s a limit to how often and how fast you can do this but otherwise, no issues.\n\nI\u2019ve changed my first name when moving here to a spelling that was more in line with English and because I never really liked my first name.\n\nWhen we got married, we blended our surnames. His was complicated af in English and I didn\u2019t want to keep mine. Kept his first two letters, my last two and shoved all the others into a k.\n\nOnly thing that\u2019s annoying is that it\u2019s a lot of work to change all your documentation afterwards. You also have to keep the change of name certificate and supply it as proof every so often because a lot of official places have a section on their paperwork that makes you list all the other names that you were previously known under.\n\nBut the reason of \u2018I don\u2019t like my name\u2019 is all that\u2019s needed to change it.", "I changed my first and last name in the UK and all I had to do was complete a form with wording to the effect of renouncing my old name and replacing it for all uses with my new one. The hardest part was sending out all the change of name letters, I am still nearly 6 years later finding places it hasn't been updated.", "I thought that the name was going to be something like this. But then came Wilson and I thought 'oh, that's actually alright'", ">except williams and johnson were not real last names  \n>  \n>so we could speculate on smithsonian or pillicock or tarotcard with as much \"accuracy\" of options.", "You go back and read the post, the whole reason she kept her last name in the first place was the reason I listed above. Downvote me all you want, doesnt make what I said incorrect. Last names in the US are 100% the fathers last name, either the father of your child or your fathers. If you go back 3 generations then its just your grandfathers last name.", "Yes- I understand that. But in this day and age, lineage is far easier to prove/disprove. \n\nAlso historically the man was the one who earned any serious money and was even able to accumulate wealth to pass on. Even the wife herself was legally considered his property in some places, including the UK, where I\u2019m from.", "But any sons would take that name too- by the time the parents are married it becomes the family name. \n\nI have no issues with kids initially being given the same name as their parents, but I do have an issue with the idea of marriage meaning that the man\u2019s name automatically becomes the family name.", "You understand that, in order to \"get there,\" we have to start somewhere.\n\nThis is the somewhere they're starting.\n\nHow are we supposed to fix it without starting to change it? Magic? Even a child could understand this. \n\nI find it incredibly disingenuous for you to say you want it to change, while complaining about people who are trying to do so. Meanwhile, we're the \"anxious weak asses\" while you're terrified to go against the status quo.\n\nWhat as shock. Who could have seen that coming.", "To each their own.", "Really, and I just responded to your other comment so nicely, too.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

People assume it\u2019s easier and many perpetuate the idea as an excuse for why their family did take same name (particularly women who feel defensive about it).  I and many friends who have their own name had zero issues while raising their kids. Not with doctors, legal documents, travel, schools\u2026.just nothing. \n\nNTA.", "He don't have a right though he had his kids n he got to make his choices. Op is the parent so its their choice.", "Woman as property in a marriage goes back much further than England/English common law.", "> nefarious trains\n\nLogging in and coming out of lurker mode to just comment that this is my new favourite typo ;-)", "That depends on the state. When I changed my name it was two forms, $125, and a brief court appearance.\n\nThe more expensive part was changing my driving license and passport.", "It's also cheaper to change your name when you're filing a marriage license. My sister kept her ex-husband's last name for years because of 1. the expense and 2. the number of professional licenses she got after marrying him.", "One thing about when my friends both changed their names after they got married...\n\nThe wife had no issues, and often times there was no fee at all involved.\n\nThe husband typically had to fill out all kinds of extra paperwork, justify why he was changing his name to the person he was dealing with, and ALWAYS had to pay a fee to process the paperwork.", "I did say that with time, we can hopefully get there. I don't think that was so bad.", "Which is exactly my point. This couple and then changing their last name affects NO ONE but themselves.", "Lol, yes, I did reply. Good job getting something right here.", "This exactly. I didn\u2019t change my name because I was also too intimidated by the paperwork. When we have kids they\u2019re just getting two last names so they match both of us without the hassle.", "Yeah I\u2019m including changing all your documents as part of the name change \u2014 just since it can be a pain in the ass if names on your legal documents don\u2019t match. Changing names on all the legal docs is more effort & fees than just the name change itself.", "I get not wanting to allow it for the funsies of it, it take away of court time and a lot of administrative work has to be done, a lot of businesses and institutions get the name change automatically from the courts, so i didnt have to make all those changes myself, but i do think they made the barriers here a little too high", "Just pointing out that your thinking is hypocritical and sexist", "I was fortunate that I was changing from my full birth certificate name to a common nickname (think Christopher to Chris) and that all my documents other than driving license and passport already said \"Chris\". Otherwise, OMG you are correct that would have been a pain in the patootie. Every bank account, credit card, Social Security, retirement accounts, insurance, IRS, W4, my  employer, all the utilities.... Yes, that is a total pain.", "I did say that, but going whole hog right away probably was a bad choice.  They didn't use either of their names they came in with something completely different but not new.  That if it was a common name like she implied.  I'm well aware that some of my opinions can be unpopular, and I don't care if they are downvoted, but with the original comment, it was benign", "Oh, and to the Bloodline thing, that's the main reason some people have children to carry on their name.  Also, this is Reddit. You know, most people that comment on here couldn't give a shit about bloodlines, blood ties, or anything like that with all the \"I hate my family\"shit on here.", "I'm an asshole. You seem reasonable.  I didn't say anything that was sexist. I just said that we were not there yet.", "Deleting comments, eh?", "Haha yeah I heard all about that from my mom. She changed her name from a very common name to an unusual one that\u2019s been jokingly called a \u2018stripper name\u2019. Basically went from \u201cSusan Johnson\u201d to \u201cMagenta Flames\u201d (fake names but honesly not that far off). No regrets but it did take a while", "You 100% said something that was sexist"]}
