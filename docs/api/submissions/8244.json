Yes, there is nothing misogynistic about changing your last name, but if someone believes that a child should automatically take the father\u2019s last name (especially to the point of not wanting to meet said child because they don\u2019t have the father\u2019s last name) that is absolutely misogyny. It\u2019s not that complicated.", "Cutting off a relationship over a name is not normal or loving. Sure, there can be other reasons, but Occam's Razor would indicate that misogyny/patriarchy is the most reasonable assumption.", "And the grandchild is the granddad\u2019s grandchild, and he\u2019s being a real asshole about meeting them"]}
