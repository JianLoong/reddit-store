I offer to help/bring things & sometimes bring the meal, but not 100% of the time & if it's a special occasion I always bring something. I had meals at my dad's house growing up long before stepmom, (met/she moved in 3 yrs ago), so at 15 I was supposed to bring flowers for my dad for feeding me in his home? Or the moment I turned 18 I was supposed to start bringing a gift each time? I live in a small not hostable apt. but when I do have room I will offer to have them over to cook meals for them, it's just not possible. My dad is well off & works from home, & she works 2 days a week, so it is not a burden for them to have me over for sandwiches.\n\nLately, stepmom has been making comments. I was giving dad a gift bag to pass on to my uncle because I was missing his party. She tried to take it  & said, \"Sorry I assumed it's a bottle for us.\" Then, she's talking about a recent wedding & who didn't give a gift & says \"I wouldn't dare walk into someone's home for lunch without a gift much less for a wedding.\" Then - she was talking with her sister, the topic came up, & she goes, \"(my name), you wouldn't believe how strict our mom was with manners, she would be rolling her grave if I came to someone's home for a meal with no gift.

Is offering to bring something/help or every once in a while bringing the meal not enough, am I really a jerk for not bringing something every time? If I am, I'll start even if she declines. Like I said, it's never even crossed my mind to apply this mentality to casual visits with my own parents, I feel like my home is their home & their home is my home to a degree, I would never expect them to bring something to my home every time if we continue these casual visits.

Your stepmother is ridiculous. I would be tempted to hit a thrift store and stock up on cheap and ridiculously ugly tchotchkes to present her with when you visit. Then make remarks about how hurt you are that she hasn\u2019t displayed your gifts and what poor manners that is.", "NTA, I\u2019d have a conversation with my dad first. Then based on how that conversation goes, I\u2019d have a talk with my stepmom about love languages and expectations. Seems like she\u2019s childish and passive aggressive, which are reflective of the manners she is so proud of\u2026 but this situation doesn\u2019t seem unfixable to me. But I go to my parents\u2019 house without an \u201coffering\u201d all the time.", "The issue is - she doesn't see you as \"family.\" She sees you as an adult who is visiting. Maybe your father can clear this up with her? It's pretty hypocritical of her to expect a gift when you pop over but she is not expected to pay or gift you each time you \"help out\" with their home.", "NTA\n\nIts your dads house and you go frequently for small meals.  It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a huge family holiday meal.\n\nYour step mother is a passive aggressive AH.  If she brings this up again, politely mention that shes been making comments like that a lot frequently and if there\u2019s something more she\u2019s implying.", "NTA, but your step mom definitely is.\nYou are right: those types of casual lunches/dinners don't need extra presents. Does she really expect sth every errk you visit??\n\nYour argument about special occasions/holidays is spot on. Imo you're completely in the right here.\n\nWhat does your dad think about this?", "NTA you eat there multiple times a week, who could expect you to buy something every time? If your dad has said nothing then let that be and ignore the rude ones. I couldn\u2019t imagine having to buy a gift multiple times a week for eating sandwiches and such.", "Are you being texted with invites solely for the gifting aspect? NTA. Discuss this with your dad. I'd never show up to invites that are frequent and still expecting a gift, especially family. It's actually rather rude to expect one and more so to comment.", "NTA. \n\nI, too, do not arrive at people's houses without some sort of gift, but like you, my parents (and my in-laws) are exempted from this rule of mine. And same for them - I don't expect them to show up with gifts, either. \n\nYour stepmom clearly doesn't see you as family and therefore sees you as simply a guest, no different than any other guest she tolerates. I'd be willing to bet that she doesn't expect her own children to show up with gifts. \n\nHonestly, the next time she says anything, I'd respond with \"Well, I was always taught that family is family and doesn't need gifts to be brought to enjoy a meal together.\" Then let it drop - if she continues to harp on it, simply acknowledge with a \"oh?\" and then walk away.", "NTA but maybe from this point forward bring the gift of a piece of bubblegum you know the kind that is pink and makes your mouth hurt after about 3 minutes because it's too tough.", "\u201cDad, it\u2019s been brought to my attention that I\u2019m being ill mannered but not bringing any gifts when I come over for lunch, would you mind jotting down a quick list of acceptable things to bring?\u201d. Bring it up in front of stepmother, with sincere apologies about your negligence, poor upbringing, and whatnot. He\u2019ll ask what\u2019s up with that, you\u2019ll elaborate, and that should put an end to stepmother\u2019s nonsense. NTA", "NTA... this is a custom where I live but it's only applied to family dinners. When we are invited out casually we sometimes ask if I can bring something but not always. And rarely when visiting my mom. However, like you we are always helping with something.\nI'd spell it out to her. \"Yes I was raised to bring a gift when I receive a formal invitation however this doesnt always apply to visiting my dad casually.  And I was also taught not to make guests feel awkward about any slights with backhanded or pointed remarks or gossip. I guess we all can sharpen our hospitality skills.\"", "NTA.  I'd say you need to bring this up quietly with your dad and ask what his expectation is.  Has he noticed her snide comments to you? Honestly, if my grown up kids felt they always had to bring something when they visited it would make me sad, as if they didn't see my house as their family home any more.", "NTA. You bring things at appropriate times. I'd be broke if I had to bring something every time I visited my parents. Does your dad drink something your step mother never would, if so I'd start bringing something specifically for him  wherever you go over and make remarks about him being a real parent who deserves nice things. But I may be a petty AH.", "Bring a stick of butter", "Nta. I rarely bring stuff to my parent. They are always like: you didnt have to. So, i prefer to ask to help make dinner.", "NTA at all. She's being a passive aggressive AH. You don't have to take anything to your parents house. Heck even a casual lunch with friends. A party at a friends house...yeah a gift is good idea. I would never take a gift nor would my mother expect me to bring one if she invited me over for a regular Wed night dinner. How absurd. I wouldn't expect it of her either.", "Nta, can you find the ugliest knick-knacks to give her that clash with her decorating? If she is polite they have to be set out every time you visit since they are gifts.", "Give her a petty gift", "NTA. This to you relatively strange woman is trying to tell you how you should behave towards your father? She should just butt out.", "NAH\n\nFirst, you cannot assume it is not a burden to have you over for sandwiches. You don't know. It's a burden to my wife to have anyone over as she is keeping up appearances. Even for close family, she needs the house cleaner than we usually keep it for ourselves. All of us suffer just to have someone over. \n\nSecond, just because your father is well off doesn't mean he doesn't want to be invited over to your smaller place for a meal. Even if he does, let him decide rather than making the decision for him.\n\nAgreed, you don't need to bring gifts to a casual family  dinners to your dad's place. \n\nHowever, I don't think you can be sure your stepmom is talking about you. She could be talking about cousin so and so and not you. Ask your dad if she feels this way before you think this comment is towards you. If she is a stickler for proper manners, she would know casual meals like this, gifts are not expected.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is breaking the cardinal etiquette rule of hosting by making whom she feels is a guest feel uncomfortable by expecting a gift. A true hostess goes above and beyond to make anyone and everyone feel comfortable and at-home in their house. Asking for gifts is the upmost in tackiness. Ugh. \n\nYes in a true etiquette situation when going to someone\u2019s home a small gift for the hostess is always a good idea. If you are going for a meal offering to bring a dish or help is also recommended. BUT you are going to what you feel like is your parents home. If I went to my parents home for weekly dinners my mother would not expect anything and she is the epitome of a proper southern lady. Family is family. The only time I bring anything would be a holiday when we are having a large meal with everyone there. \n\nSo long answer to say your stepmom wouldn\u2019t know etiquette if it bit her in the ass. If she demands a gift next time bring her a copy of Emily Post with a few parts highlighted.", "Exactly, I would never expect my adult daughter to bring a gift over for a casual meal. That's insane.
