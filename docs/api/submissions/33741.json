As hard as it is, as someone else said, he needs to hit a bottom before he decides to get help. They only postpone that process by giving him breaks. No place to stay, no money, cut off contact.", "NTA\n\nYour brother hasn't hit rock bottom yet and until he does, nothing will change.", "NTA. My sister is the same way. She\u2019s yo-yo\u2019d back and forth between sobriety, in and out of jail, and all sorts of other terrible things for over a decade now. She\u2019s been cut off for it. She\u2019s gotten countless chances to redeem herself and she\u2019s chosen to dig the hole deeper. Your brother is doing the same to himself and you will be better off for cutting him off.", "NTA. It's sticking to boundaries that were set to keep your family safe.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nYour family is enabling him and in denial of doing so. Cut ties and maybe they will follow", "NTA at this point it sounds like they might just be enabling his bad behaviour if they don\u2019t decide to kick him out.", "Hi OP, I\u2019m going to say NAH on this one (besides your brother). \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for wanting to protect you and your family from someone who is actively harming you and your loved ones. Loving someone that self destructs themselves time and time again is hard, watching someone unalive themselves slowly is painful. Being abused by them is even worse, cause deep down you still have deep love for that person but there\u2019s an awareness there that that person you loved? They\u2019re not there anymore. You need to do whatever you need to do to keep yourself safe, but please try understand that it\u2019s not going to be easy for your family to follow you. \n\nYour mother lost her husband, the love of her life and she\u2019s holding onto whatever family she has left while she\u2019s fresh in her grief. She may also feel like a failure as a parent, and letting go of the child that\u2019s screaming for help could be tugging at her. She may not see what she\u2019s doing as enablement, cause she\u2019s a mom and it\u2019s a moms job to protect and love their children unconditionally, so it\u2019s very much possible that your mother is currently facing her own demons when it comes to her son. It\u2019s not easy watching your child plummet so far without having a way of reaching them. \n\nThe thing with addictions is that you can\u2019t help someone that doesn\u2019t /want/ help, and you can\u2019t push people to go to rehab cause then it won\u2019t work. The person has to /want/ to get better, and they have to /want/ to put in the work.  Addictions is an escape, an escape from all your problems in life, your demons, pain and trauma, etc, in rehab you have to go over a lot of that and reopen wounds to basically figure out how and why you became an addict. Sadly, reaching for an addiction is a lot easier than talking about things that hurt deep inside. \n\nHave you or your family considered seeking out groups for families of addicts? There\u2019s a few on Reddit that you can take a peek at, there\u2019s also AA type meetings for families and there\u2019s just a lot of resources out there that could help you and your family, and I do encourage you to look for them. Because what you are all going through? It\u2019s pretty big, and it may be too big to deal with by yourselves and it may help to have people who have been where you are, who are going through the same things, etc.", "NTA. Addicts have to hit rock bottom before they will embrace recovery. OP's brother has not hit rock bottom, because his family keeps keeping him from it. OP's brother is going to keep on stealing and using, because his family is enabling his addiction. That's fine, but they have been forewarned.", "It took my mother four stints in rehab to \u201cget over\u201d (if you ever really can) her addiction to alcohol. Left my sister & I with more trauma than I will go into here. My dad never got help for it, probably never will. My sister spiraled down that path and continues that generational curse with her own children. I refuse to do that; I have undergone extensive therapy due to the actions of my addict parents and have grown greatly because of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have forgiven them. Frankly, I don\u2019t think I ever *truly* will forgive them. You won\u2019t find alcohol in my house under any circumstances. A lot of people think it\u2019s too strict, that I\u2019m somehow a buzzkill for it. But they don\u2019t understand\u2014I *cannot* take the chance that I carry that addictive personality gene. Addicts have a disease, yes, but that disease impacts those around them just as much as it does them, if not even more so. NTA.", "OS and I were asked our opinions. We agreed.", "This is exactly what I'm trying to say. I'm being made out to be hateful and vengeful. I plan to show mother these comments.", "They should know however that by making his life easy they are helping himself continue to kill himself and victimize more people.  Maybe they don\u2019t understand that enabling is deadly for addicts", "Google AlAnon about addictive behavior.  It will give you some insight.\n\nEvery addict has their own rock bottom, and you never know what it will take to make them see the light. I talked to one guy who had been to rehab 7x times. \n\nWhen I asked why so many, he said \"didn't take\" until it did.\n\nYour family is enabling him and doing him no favors."]}
