Sometimes it surprises us just how much humanity we continue to find in a subreddit full of assholes. Your conflicts of [family feuds](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d1r1vr/aita_for_not_teaching_a_skill_to_my_oldest_son/), [neighbor nuisances](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k22wmu/aita_for_going_out_my_bedroom_window_at_1am/), [roommate rumbles](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rfvmjm/aita_for_snapping_when_i_found_out_that_a_guy_saw/), and [coworker catastrophes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rfwgmc/aita_for_perpetuating_ethnic_stereotypes_about/) (not to mention the occasional [party sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca7bdz/aita_because_i_ate_more_than_my_share_of_a_6_foot/)) have turned r/AmItheAsshole into an incredible community that's flush with empathy and overflowing with judgement.\n\nTo celebrate, we\u2019ve brought [hundreds of more party favors](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154rwsu/repent_your_assholery_as_we_say_goodbye_to_awards/) and have some [fantastic music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrgpZ0fUixs) We originally set off to write a brief history of those 10 years, but there\u2019s so much that\u2019s relevant, it\u2019s hard to know what to include. (Not to mention, we just did that [last Christmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvvwln/i_woke_up_to_5_million_assholes_in_my_stocking/).) This time around, we want to hear from all of you! Share your stories about the subreddit. What would you want to talk about here? For our favourite comments, the mods will be handing out the illustrious Golden Asshole awards we have leftover. \n\nSo, from the entire mod team: here's to 10 million subscribers, 10 years of amazing conflicts, and a future that's bound to be just as colorful and shitty as our most creative poop puns yet!
