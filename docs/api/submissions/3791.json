You sound like a great person!", "nta\n\nbut legally, you may not have a leg to stand on unless u get a lawyer...", "NTA You're fighting the good fight, big sis. Stay strong and keep going", "NTA. You and Jenna are just fine without those people.", "I mean if the only option for your family is a 2 bed/2bath home. Then I guess that's what you do.\n  \nBut there's another option. YOU.\n  \nFor 18 months, you've given Jenna a stable, caring home. And your dad hasn't checked in on her in months. And now he wants to completely uproot her stable home life where she has her own room to move 60 miles away and share a room with FIVE people?\n  \nIf Jenna is telling you that she doesn't want to go, listen to her. And get a judge to listen to her.\n  \nNTA", "He abandoned her, put her in your care. Keep her with you. NTA", "NTA. Your father physically and financially abandoned your sister to your care. He's the AH majorly. And only wants her back to take care of the younger siblings.", "NTA, you are looking out for her. I doubt all the family membera judging you actually know the real story behind all this.\nGo to court ans fight this with all your might, Jenna is old enough to emancipate and choose herself where she wants to live!", "NTA. \nIf your father truly wants what's best for Jenna, he'd swallow his ego and let her stay with you and allow you legal guardianship.", "Sounds like dad needs a live-in babysitter.", "NTA file for custody if you haven't done so already", "NTA. She is lucky to have you.", "NTA but if you left home when you were 16, why can't she? Get a lawyer. Your sister is old enough  to say who she wants to live with but may mean taking steps to legally remove herself from her parents.", "NTA, but no way you win custody of her. If you have a bunch of money to spend you can maybe delay the inevitable, but in the end no judge is going to give a daughter to a sister over her bio Dad. Even though clearly Jenna would be better off in the stable home you have provided her. Your best bet would be if you could come to an understanding with Dad that would allow her to stay in the same school for at least the rest of this school year. If Dad really is sympathetic he might agree to this. Good luck to you all.", "Also, having another minor would increase how much he gets from any government assistance. That was my first thought. My husband brought up that if he receives child support from mom, he\u2019d get more money from that as well. Either way, OP is NTA here.", "Not just free childcare. Also he can't collect on a child not in his possession.", "Yep, just following in the footsteps of having handed off Jenna to OP.  Now Jenna's old enough, he can hand off the other kids to her.  \n\nJust the very fact that he basically abandoned Jenna to her own older sister, is enough evidence to claim that HE is unfit to care for HER.", "I\u2019m worried about her and we might try visits but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to take her. She\u2019s a lot to deal with and as much as I love Jenna, she\u2019s already a handful.", "apparently OP is already her legal guardian", "I might try to set up visits but she\u2019s very difficult and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to handle her.", "He and 3 of them are already there", "I let her go out by herself (she has a tracker on her phone and she has to be back by dark) and they\u2019re accusing me of bringing strange men to the house around her. I introduced her to my boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) of 2 years.", "He stopped paying support a long time ago.", "I moved in with grandparents and my parents didn\u2019t fight it. It\u2019s a little different now with our dad fighting it.", "why is she the ta?", "I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s unlikely that I get custody. I\u2019m going to fight like hell to be able to keep her. This is her home and she wouldn\u2019t be safe over there.", "OH DAMN! That's a devastating point, especially if he'd been claiming it for the last two years when she wasn't living with him and he wasn't paying for her upkeep, he could be in serious trouble. OP may even have a case for back child support against him.\n\nNTA", "Depends on the state and even the town in the US.  There are plenty of places where the cops will just shrug and tell you to piss off if you complain that your 16 year old is going to school and living with their sibling.", "It would depend on what country they live in. In Canada and the UK 16 year olds can live on their own without the parents having a say.", "Yeah, if you have gaurdianship willingly given over that should hold significant sway shouldn't it", "She wants to stay with you which is a positive step already. Do what keeps her safe you're the adult in this situation", "Yeah okay, but it'll still be 5 people in a house with 5 bedrooms which seems kinda cramped.", "They both should be, even if they aren\u2019t. Legally you should be entitled to it for the care of your sister", "Tell him if he tries to take her, you and your sister will be documenting with child services that she doesn't feel safe living her other siblings and that he's intending to try to use her for free child care because he can't take care of three young kids on his own.\n\nParentification is frowned on by child services and his two year absence matters.", "Not to mention how many times he bothered to visit.", "Yes, but if this is the case, when the OP goes to court, the judge will see the fraud and the motivation, and it will be even less likely that the dad will get custody.", "9 year old barely knows me and hasn\u2019t said anything about wanting to live with me. I might try to do visits and maybe take her if I think I can handle her but right now I can\u2019t take her.", "I think you mean 2 bedrooms. Jenna, my fianc\u00e9, and I are moving to the 5 bedroom house", "Sounds like OP might or might not be the 'legal' guardian, depending on the laws where she lives. That needs to be settled asap"]}
