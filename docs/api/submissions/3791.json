I\u2019m the oldest of 5, then there\u2019s my little sister, Jenna (16f), then 2 boys (14and 12), then another girl (9). Our mom blatantly favors the younger 3. I moved out when Jenna was 4 but I\u2019ve always babysat her, she\u2019s slept over at least one weekend a month, and we talked every day. \n\nBoth boys have a learning disability and anger issues. The youngest girl is just a brat. I don\u2019t speak to any of them. My mom enables all of them. Then there\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s spineless but he is sympathetic to Jenna. \n\nAround 18 months ago, my dad called and asked if I could take Jenna (then 14) for a few months. He wanted to leave our mom and wanted her to be in a safe place. I took her in and at first things were okay. My dad gave me a couple hundred a month to help with her expenses, he visited a few times a week and they FaceTimed daily. Over time, the visits became less and less and the payments stopped. My dad hasn\u2019t seen Jenna in 4 months and hasn\u2019t spoken to her in 2. \n\nHe\u2019s also gotten into arguments with me about me moving Jenna to a school closer to me and openly judges my parenting. I was driving Jenna to a shitty school (2/10 rating) 20 miles away every day when there\u2019s a school with a 9/10 half a mile away. \n\nJenna has been with me so long that I\u2019m actually in the process of buying a bigger house for us (we\u2019re in a 2 bed 1 bath and we\u2019re moving to a 5 bed 3 bath). \n\nA couple weeks ago, my dad called and told me he got a house and he wants Jenna back. He has custody of all of her siblings and bought a 2 bed 2 bath condo 60 miles away from me. I\u2019ve talked to Jenna and she doesn\u2019t want to go. She doesn\u2019t feel safe sharing a room with her siblings, she doesn\u2019t want to change schools, and she doesn\u2019t want to be 60 miles from me. \n\nI told my dad that Jenna and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with her being so far from me and having to share a room with her younger siblings so she\u2019s going to stay with me.  \n\nHe said that I can\u2019t do that and she has to live with her parent but she hasn\u2019t lived with him in a year and a half. She hasn\u2019t spoken to him in 2 months and hasn\u2019t seen him in 4. I\u2019m going to court to have her stay with me but my entire family (except Jenna, of course) is against me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1670014178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zax6kn/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_back_to_my_dad/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which is not her job.", "NTA\n\nIf anything you're the opposite of an asshole. Everyone should have a person who is looking out for them the way you look out for your sister.", "NTA,\n\nI do wish you luck in court and get a good lawyer; these things can be harder/more arbitrary depending on the judge and what they ate that morning than one would like. But sounds like you have a lot of safety reasons and have effectively had custody for long enough that you should have a precedent. IANAL, just a step parent who was there for an ugly custody battle.", "NTA...\n\nLawyer up...\nAt the very least, a consult with a lawyer that practices family law.\nSave receipts: proof of supporting a dependent\nBank statements: proof of you paying for all her expenses\nIf your dad did deposits, point out how he pretty much stopped\nLetters from teachers: establish a link to stability\nPossibly get old school records if her grades improved.\nLetter from your mortgage company and/or credit report: proof of financial stability and the ability to support both you and her.\nDates of FaceTime, texts, emails and phone calls of both of your conversations with him: it shows your story is not just word of mouth and  the decline in communication and what his plans are... \n\nGood luck", "NTA. Dad can't abandon her when it suits him to get shot and demand her back when it doesn't. She wants to stay with you after 18 months and it means leaving school unwillingly at the most important time in her education. Fuck the rest of your asshole family, you protect your sister.\n\nP.S. Your new internet nickname is Buffy. :)", "NTA, I'd say it's evident that you have her best interests at heart. You are doing what is right for her. Even in your current resident she has her own room, why should she move to a house where she'll have to share with 3 other children. \n\nShe's better off with you because you've given her something that your dad hasn't. Stability", "NTA. You sound like an amazing sister. You are doing way more than what should have ever been asked or expected of you. Jenna will be better off with you. Don\u2019t feel bad and don\u2019t back down.", "NTA. I am Jenna\u2019s age, and I would feel uncomfortable sharing a room with siblings that act the way you have described. I would also want to stay where I feel safe, and if she feels safest with you, keep her with you. You sound like you are doing well as a parent.", "NTA. You are amazing. Jenna is lucky to have you.", "NTA - consult with an attorney to get ahead of your parents.  At her age, you guys should not have much of an issue being able to ensure she stays with you - especially considering the history.  Do you have written communication about all of this when it was first established?  So that your parents can't say that Jenna was just spending some with her sister?", "NTA. Please do contact children's aide, give them the whole back story, see if you can officially get temporary custody while you're waiting for the courts. Just in case someone decides to do something drastic to take her away from you.", "NTA by any means. But I will say document everything. Keep all receipts showing that she's been in your care for as long as she has. Also don't delete any sort of text messages and make sure all communication goes through writing just in case he decides to throw a false kidnapping charge or something like that. She should be considered old enough to be allowed to choose, but that varies not only from place to place but also from judge to judge. So it's best you have all your ducks in a row.", "NTA But he's also right. You can't do that, he's her parent and (apparently) legal guardian and she was staying with you with his permission. You need to talk to a lawyer ASAP if you want to dispute it. I do have a feeling that you're being biased by your poor opinion of your family and kind of stuck in the attitude that it's \"you and her\" against them.\n\nThe fact that there would be 4 kids, boys and girls, sharing a bedroom would look pretty bad if it came in front of a judge and her wanting to stay with you AND him asking you to take her in the first place would look good... but the laws on this vary a lot and some judges just wouldn't care. If he's as spineless as you think he might just cave rather than going through another custody battle, but if he reports her as a runaway you're likely to have a knock at your door and a police car to drive her \"home\".  \n\n\nETA: Apparently she is the legal guardian which leaves him playing the world's smallest violin. He thought he was gaming the system sending her to OP's house during the custody battle for the other kids and he's being a sore loser now that he lost the game.", "NTA, and wishing you luck with the court proceedings! Hopefully she\u2019s old enough that they\u2019ll let her have the final say on where she wants to live.", "NTA. Become legal guardian if you can. Or help her get emancipated and just let her live with you. If you have documentation to support the fact that the parents didn't take care of her for a full year and a half it shouldn't be a hard case to win. Sounds like a really bad family dynamic and I'd guess there's a lot of drinking going on too. Good for you for getting out. Stick together with your sister and just keep loving each other.", "Nta. She's old enough to tell the judge where she wants to go and why.", "NTA. You're up for a nasty ride. Lawyer up and be prepared. Your father technically abandoned her when he stopped visiting and speaking with her even if it was for  \"only\" 2 months. You clearly want the best for your sister and many judges would be able to see that. Wish you luck with everything, you're an awesome big sister.", "NTA. Your father doesn\u2019t quite merit the title right now. Your sister is lucky to have you. I hope you can also support your other siblings.", "NTA.  Good luck in court.", "NTA. Good luck", "NTA and good luck in court! We're all pulling for you!", "NTA. I don\u2019t know about the legal side but morally you\u2019re being a wonderful big sis and I hope everything works out for you. Depending on where you are, I think at her age chances are good she\u2019ll be allowed to stay with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019ve been a trooper to help your sis. Instead of fighting your dad for custody, see if she can be legally emancipated.
