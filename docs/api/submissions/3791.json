And she might have also had some sort of temporary document that was enough for school but wouldn't hold up fighting for custody.", "A lot of the time they do check. I was enrolling in a new school at my mom's house after my dad gave up custody to her. The school wouldn't let this father enroll his kid into the school without a copy of the custody agreement to see if he was legally allowed too.", "They're supposed to check, but I saw a situation exactly like this with a 15yo who was staying with family just a few years ago and they didn't.\n\nI think that they know to check in the case of single parents but don't always catch it with weirder custody situations. There might also be some kind of database that flags court-ordered custody agreements because lots of parents (who weren't married) don't have a legal custody agreement or parenting plan in the first place.", "Yes, but after 2 years she will need legal guardianship. For doctors and many more. And she said she has legal guardianship. I don't think the courts are gonna take too lightly that he stopped paying, visiting, and speaking to her on top of making her stay in a room with two teenage boys and a literal child in one room anyway", "I don't really know what you're trying to explain to me... She already clarified that she has legal guardianship, \"after two years\" doesn't really mean anything because once she's enrolled in a school it's not going to come up again unless there's a medical emergency.\n\nI already said all the other stuff about how \"dad\" would look if this went to court."]}
