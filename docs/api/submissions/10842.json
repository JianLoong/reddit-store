Things are going really great. She\u2019s quite independent, funny, smart, and just all around a nice person. \n\nLast weekend, my mom called me to tell me she, my dad, and my sister would be going to our lake house (about two hours from where we are) for a weekend in a few weeks and asked if I could come. I was for it and my mom mentioned that if I wanted to bring my girlfriend I could. I know it could be a little early, but I was excited for her to meet them and I knew they\u2019d love her. \n\nI asked my girlfriend about it and she thanked me, but wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it. She had previously bought tickets to a touring Broadway show months before we started dating and it was going to be the weekend my family would be at the lake. I asked her if she\u2019d consider skipping it to meet my family, but she told me the tickets were nonrefundable and it was a show she wanted to see at least once live. She expressed she would love to meet my family and suggested that maybe we work something out at a later date. I thought it was weird that she never mentioned it and asked if someone was going with her. She said no, which honestly isn\u2019t unusual. Like I said she\u2019s pretty independent and has done a lot of activities and trips by herself. However, I found it weird that it hadn\u2019t come up and to her it wasn\u2019t something that she felt she had to bring up since our conversations never really brought up musicals. I asked her again if she would consider skipping it and once again she said no. She apologized for not being upfront about it and definitely saw where I was coming from with that. She also then told me she had tickets for several other shows in the coming months and I asked her if she was planning on doing those alone. She said she was because she bought the tickets before we were dating and once again couldn\u2019t get a refund. Nor did she want to. \n\nI told her I found it hurtful she would do things that didn\u2019t include me and wouldn\u2019t consider canceling them since she had a boyfriend. She said she\u2019d be happy to see if we could get another ticket for me to join, but honestly I hate musicals. Is it weird that she is doing this? Am I really asking too much for her to not do things by herself since we are together now? She told me that I was being an AH for expecting her to revolve her life and plans only around a boyfriend of two months and she is fine doing things with or without me.", "created_utc": 1677294790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bagne/aita_for_expecting_my_girlfriend_to_cancel_plans/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has a life beyond you. And 2 months is not a long time to be dating. And WAY too soon to be making demands.", "YTA. So... You are arguing that she should never go see another musical? What? And that she should skip something she already paid non-refundable money for? Wtf.", "YTA. Theater tickets can be very expensive. She bought them before she met you. Expecting her to piss away hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of tickets just because she met you is selfish. I\u2019m sure you can find something to do for an evening while she is at the theater.", "Two months in and you're already expecting her to drop everything the second you want her to? Yikes.\n\nYTA", "Dude, you\u2019re the kind of clingy that\u2019s all making us worry about the safety of your soon to be ex girlfriend. For her sake I hope she runs. YTA.", "YTA. Doing things without your partner is fine. Complaining about your partner doing things without you that *you don't want to do either* is just absurd. \n\nIf she didn't feel like going to the lakehouse because she doesn't like cottaging, would you be okay with her vetoing you going to the lakehouse anymore?", "you're 26? come on grow up", "YTA. Broadway tickets are extremely expensive, selling for hundreds of dollars. She also planned this for months before you two even met, and you gave her a few days heads up. You're being ridiculous, and the fact that you hate musicals does not make you any less of an AH. She's right- her life doesn't revolve around you.\n\nI hope your GF enjoys her shows.", "Yta\nI have a feeling that you already lost your gf. After your conversation about meeting with the parents I would run if I were the gf.", "It's pretty damn normal that whatever plans a person made first are the plans they stick with. YTA", "YTA ABSOLUTELY! Just cause you're dating doesn't mean her life needs to revolve around you and frankly your life shouldn't revolve around either. It's completely normal and I think healthy to do stuff separately from each other. It doesn't matter if you are only dating 2 months or if you're dating 4 years, this is NOT ok behavior.", "YTA. Don\u2019t sweat it, she\u2019s gonna peace out so it\u2019ll be a non-issue.", "YTA.  Please give us her contact info so we can warn her what a controlling jerk you are going to turn into.  She\u2019s not allowed to do things without you?  Even if you were married, she\u2019d still be allowed to do things separately.

It's embarrassing and more than a red flag, that in one breath you state how you enjoy her independence but in another, \"she should cancel every plan she made ever that doesn't include me\". Or rather could take time away from me because I definitely don't want to invest in her passions/hobbies/interests.\n\n1. You have been dating only 2 months- who do you think you are??\n\n2. You're asking her to give up events she's truly passionate about NOT because you want to go with but rather that you don't want her to go with no good reason. \n\n3. You're on the closer side to 30, grow up.\n\nYou're the AH and truly hope there was a typo and that you're actually 16. But even then, still YTA", "YTA. And frankly it\u2019s a bit of a red flag that you think she shouldn\u2019t be able to do things on her own since you are dating. If I were her and I knew you felt that way, I\u2019d break up with you. \n\nFurthermore, these are plans that she made for herself before you were dating and it\u2019s not something you\u2019d want to do anyway. Are you really suggesting that she should forego seeing musicals for the duration of your relationship because you aren\u2019t into them.", "YTA.  At 2 months dating, you are very new in your relationship, not even long enough to call each other by boyfriend/girlfriend terms exclusively.  You're DATING, not fully committed.  \n\nTake it from someone in a 30 years exclusive relationship, keeping our individual interests allows us to keep it interesting.  We also join each other in activities we wouldn't necessarily choose to do on our own, especially when traveling.  We support individual activities and appreciate the alone time.  \n\nIf you want your relationship to grow and last, talk to each other and describe what you're each wanting.  Cut the ties and wish her well if you're looking for someone joined at the hip.", "YTA \n\nTheater is her passion and you have to purchase the tickets in advance. She bought them before meeting you and it\u2019s selfish of you to expect her to miss something she\u2019s been looking forward to for a long time.", "Oof YTA. You're asking A LOT of someone you've only been dating a couple months. And if your family has a lakehouse, I'm willing to bet this isn't a one time chance for her to hang out there. \n\nYour gf is her own person and has her own life. She shouldn't have to give up things she's passionate about just because it makes you delay something you want. Do you actually care about her as a person? Or just about her role in your life?", "Y'all weren't even together when she bought the tickets. Get over yourself. Your family won't die if they don meet her. She has her own life and is entitled to it", "YTA. You sound like a controlling and manipulative partner who doesn\u2019t enjoy having a self-sufficient and independent gf. The fact that you tried to guilt trip your gf to change plans she had previously made before she met you is just one of the many red flags about you when you\u2019re in a relationship. You don\u2019t own her. You\u2019ll never own her. She\u2019s a free woman who\u2019s allowed to do as she pleases with or without you involved. You\u2019ve only been together for a couple of months. She probably isn\u2019t ready to meet your family anyways. It\u2019s not always about you and your wants/needs. The fact that you\u2019re picking your family over your gf is very telling and I imagine that won\u2019t change even if you marry her which would be so sad and pathetic on your part. Chill. Apologize. Do better. Be better. If you keep it up you\u2019ll be single sooner than you realize. I\u2019ll be honest, your gf can do so much better than you. I know I sure wouldn\u2019t put up with you for a second.", "YTA - read this out loud and ask yourself if you sound like a whiny kid.  Why would she tell you about tickets she bought before you dated?  She\u2019s not answerable to you nor does she need to check with you. You invited her, she said sorry I have plans that weekend do you expect her to give you an itinerary for the next 6 months.", "YTA. Why can\u2019t she do things by herself?? My god you sound clingy, pushy and irritating af.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou want her to cancel plans she made independently of you. You say you love her independence... followed up with :\n\n    I told her I found it hurtful she would do things that didn\u2019t include me\n     and wouldn\u2019t consider canceling them since she had a boyfriend.", "Lol you can't be serious.  Of course YTA.", "Get over yourself", "YTA this is fucking weird dude. You could use some independence of your own, being in a relationship shouldn\u2019t mean you absorb one another.", "YTA. Meeting an SO\u2019s family for the first time is the opposite of relaxing, no matter the setting. Also, if you hate musicals, why should she invite you to this one that she\u2019s really looking forward to? You\u2019ve been dating for two months, don\u2019t be so clingy.", "Your main character syndrome is showing. She has a life outside of you. She had one before you, she will have one after you. She will have interests that aren't yours just as you will have interests that aren't hers. A girlfriend does not exist solely to be an extension of you. If that's what you're looking for, might I suggest a waifu pillow. YTA.", "YTA, you can make yourself a blanket out of all of those red flags to keep you warm at the lake house....", "INFO: So do you ever do things without her?", "She's not allowed to do things by herself since you're together now? Bro, that is straight up controlling. If you elevate that belief, it borders on abusive. You need to straighten yourself out, and by the sounds of it you'll be lucky to be able to do that before she ditches your ass.\n\nYou have serious issues with relationships. YTA.", "Well this isn\u2019t going to last long. I say don\u2019t stress if you are the AH or not because honestly the relationship will likely be over before your family vacation anyway. Good luck dummy.", "How dare she plan anything in advance without your permission!!! Controlling much? Meeting the family for an entire weekend 2 months in? No worries you\u2019ll probably be single again and won\u2019t have to worry about that pesky problem of her trying to do things on her own anymore. YTA", "\u2026\u2026..this is literally terrifying behavior my dude. You are narcissistic, manipulative, and controlling and need major help. YTA ffs.", "YTA- she had a life before you came along and she\u2019ll have one after you\u2019ve gone, which will be very soon if you keep this behavior up.", "YTA. Good for her for standing her ground and saying no. Also, she should only have to tell you \u201cno\u201d once, dude.", "YTA. if you hate musicals then why are you made she\u2019s going without you? Why is there an expectation she cancel all of her plans just because you around? Grow up, I hope she finds this and dumps you.", "YTA. It is very weird for you to expect her to cancel all the things she had planned before you met.", "Boo fucking hoo. Stop whining  YTA", "YTA! She made all these plans before you two got together and she has no obligations to cancel just bec of you are a couple now. Also, she express that these are shows that she's eager to see once in her lifetime so that should've clued you in that this means a lot to her. Since you're self-absorbed you didn't notice that", "YTA. You both should be able to have separate time, and she bought these tickets before you started dating.", "YTA. Why tf are you even with this girl if you\u2019re not gonna let her enjoy her musical? It\u2019s obvious you two aren\u2019t compatible.", "YTA\n\nThis is unbelievable.\n\nDid you really meet a grown woman and think she didn\u2019t have anything on the calendar? No tickets? No events? No classes? No parties? No trips? No wedding invitations?\n\nDo you have NOTHING scheduled in the future? Nothing??\n\nIf you guys stay together, she is supposed to forgo all of her interests for the rest of her life unless you\u2019re also interested in them?\n\nLike, in your brain, every single woman with Taylor Swift tickets would sell them if she got into a relationship with a man who didn\u2019t like Taylor Swift? No women would see Taylor Swift unless her boyfriend wanted to go?\n\nI am completely baffled by your perception of the world.", "YTA. I would tell her to run far away from you. \n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 everywhere", "Did not have to finish reading to tell that YTA\ud83e\udd29", "I dont think u 2 are compatible", "YTA majorly. Don't start this controlling, your time is mine bs. It's borderline abuse and you're not gonna have a girlfriend long.", "Jesus christ you are a controlling asshole who thinks a lot of themselves.

YTA", "YTA and a big red flag bud. 2 months and you want her to meet your parents? Your mad that your gf of literally a few weeks is not going to cancel her plans that she paid money for you? Yikes.", "It's perfectly normal to date and still do things solo. Dating doesn't mean sudden unhealthy codependency. Or at least it shouldn't.", "YTA for the exact reasons she said. She shouldn't have to be 'up front' to someone she's been dating 2 months that there are some days she has plans. You shouldn't be getting all huffy because she's going to do something you wouldn't come along to BY HERSELF.", "Definitely asshole-adjacent here, but I think it's more likely that you're just inexperienced in romantic relationships. \n\nYou're asking too much, too soon. It's great that you like each other, but pump the brakes a bit. \n\nIt's also important to understand that it's perfectly healthy in a relationship for the people not to share 100% of each other's interests. It's healthy for her to continue to like musicals, and continue to attend them, with or without you. Similarly, if you have interests that she doesn't share. \n\nRelax a little, and enjoy the growth of the relationship.", "YTA. For her sake I hope she's an ex soon. This is a scary amount of entitlement to her time and choices.", "Dude really your gf of 2 months has plans that we're made before you. She does t want to miss a show she has planned to see for some time and you're pissed off because she won't reschedule her life because she had the honor of being invited to your parents lake house. At least you are showing her what you are really like before she invests more wasted time on you if this is how you act.", "How did you write all this out and not realize YTA?", "YTA.\n\nI think its good and perfectly okay for her to want to be independent and see these shows alone. Just because she is now in a relationship doesn't mean she isn't her own person.\n\nAs for meeting the parents... her tickets are non refundable (and probably were expensive, something she planned before you were together, AND something she has wanted to see for a while. I wouldn't want to cancel my plans either. Its clear she isn't doing it to be mean and wants to meet your family soon. Try and see it from her POV and plan another time for her to meet your family.", "Um, do you think girlfriends cease existing when you aren\u2019t around? Obviously she can do stuff alone. You are being wildly controlling. YTA", "YTA- haha, poor heart. You don\u2019t own her and she\u2019s an independent woman. No, she should never break already planned things just because you came along.", "YTA you\u2019re being weirdly controlling and judgemental. She had these plans before and the ticket is non refundable - what else do you need to know? Neither of these things is weird. Also decide on whether you think she\u2019s an AH for going alone or not canceling plans. Don\u2019t just throw all the spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks", "YTA. She offered to see about getting another ticket so you could join her, which is a healthy level of compromise. Expecting her to cancel everything and reframe her life around you is not healthy, and kiddo, you should probably sit down with yourself and have an honest look at what that's about before it bites you in the ass any harder.", "YTA it\u2019s too soon to meet your family (and spend the weekend?!??) anyway.", "YTA - y'all have only been dating for two months and she already had major plans. She's clearly been looking forward to this show for a long time, and it's not cool of you to pressure her into cancelling it. If there's something she enjoys that you don't (in this case Musicals), you have to be understanding and respectful that she might do stuff without you sometimes.", "YTA. Why is it so weird to you that she has plans and interests of her own? Is she supposed to be glued to you 24/7? Do you expect her to stop liking anything you don\u2019t like?\n\nAlso, it\u2019s totally reasonable of her to not agree to go on a weekend trip with someone and their whole family after two months of dating.", "Yikes OP. You need to listen to Reddit and stop w this controlling, entitled behavior or you\u2019ll be single VERY soon. \nYTA", "[removed]", "Dude \u2014 you're her boyfriend, not a tattoo. \n\nJust because you're together now doesn't mean she has to take you everywhere she goes.\n\nYTA", "YTA - And you're clingy too.   \n\n\nI suggest you break up until you reach the point that you're perfectly fine doing things yourself while she's enjoying things that she enjoys. Otherwise you're not a match.  \n\n\n\"I don't like what she likes, so I want her to give it up for me\" - grow up man", "Oh yeah. YTA. She had a life before you that was pretty good and she\u2019s allowed to still have that life now that she\u2019s with you. If you expect her to let all the things that made her happy go away now that she\u2019s seeing you, she probably won\u2019t be seeing you much longer.", "YTA - she does not have to revolve her life around you. Period. It\u2019s honestly a really healthy thing for couples to be their own person and have their own interests, and you expecting her to revolve her life around you is blowing my mind.\n\nI get being bummed she can\u2019t come, but you need to be realistic. She was so sweet and reasonable to suggest a different time and your insistence she cancel is incredibly immature and shows a lack of confidence. I can\u2019t lie, I would probably dump you if I were her considering it\u2019s only been 2 months and you are already showing this kind of behaviour. \n\nI mean this so genuinely, you sound like someone who would benefit from some independence yourself and I hope you get it sorted because someone like her will be fine without you in her life but by the sounds of it the reverse might not be true.", "YTA. You're mad at her for doing things that don't include you that she planned before you were dating? Mad because she won't cancel them when you're only 2 months in and there's plenty of time to do things with you and/or meet your family. It's not a limited time thing like her NON-REFUNDABLE shows that are possibly once in a lifetime.", "You are one giant walking red flag, my guy. YTA.", "This is the period of dating where you either \"..Press on, man..\" Or gtfo. \n\nIt is clear that you appreciate her independence yet part of you wants to control the narrative.\n\nFirst of all why would she need to clear any itinerary with you after only two months of dating? Unless you live together and I am guessing not, maybe you need to chill.\n\nShe had plans before you came into the scene. Either go with her on her plans or don't, up to you, but back well off from expecting this woman to coddle to your schedule.\n\n\nAlso...your family meet-cute can happen any time, but her non-refundable ticket won't and when someone politely declines...accept that answer.\n\nYTA for asking her to change plans to do what you want at the expense of what she ALREADY Planned months in advance.

It\u2019s super creepy how clingy you are at 2 months. I\u2019m guessing this is your first relationship, but it is not normal nor healthy to attempt to dictate all activities of your girlfriend. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s looking for a way to exit stage right.", "YTA. Just because the two of you are dating doesn\u2019t mean that you all of a sudden become one entity. You are two individuals which means that you do not need to be glued at the hips all the time, and not only that, she made these arrangements before she even met you. Broadway tickets are usually not cheap and you expect her to lose out on something she truly enjoys, and money, after only two months of dating you? \n\nPlus, you don\u2019t want her to do things without you and when she tries to include you, you state that you don\u2019t even like musicals. Then why complain about being left out of those particular plans?!", "YTA. What in the world makes you think that she should cancel her solo plans just because she is dating you?\n\nIs she not allowed to have her own interests? Must she spend every minute with you? Why do you think she has to tell you everything she plans?\n\nYou are waving a lot of alarming flags around.", "YTA, and likely a single one pretty soon as well", "YTA\n\nMy goodness, you first write that you're happy she is independent, but then go on and on about how you hate that she's independent. You've been together for 2 months and you already expect her to drop her own life for you. That would be a huge red flag to me. Even after 20 years of marriage my husband and I still have activities that we do seperate from eachother.", "OP, your relationship is too early for you to have all these expectations. You are a walking red flag \ud83d\udea9.", "YTA. She has plans to something that she might never get another chance at, ever. Your parents *own* the lakehouse, there will definitely be other chances [if you stay together]. Of course she going to choose the tickets!\n\nAs for doing things independently... um, its healthy and normal to have some separate hobbies and pastimes! Its very controling or clingy, or both, to expect she wouldn't.", "YTA you\u2019re being very clingy and controlling 2 months into your new relationship. She bought those tickets before you two started dating, so she\u2019s not obligated to cancel them to meet your parents.

Keep this clingy and controlling behavior up if you want her to leave you.", "Do you expect her to ask your permission before making a doctors appointment? Going to the grocery? Seeing her mom? HUGE YTA!!!", "Dude Yikes. YTA", "YTA. Why should she give up things she enjoys simply because you don't want to go? Also if you want to continue this relationship you need to do some things she likes even if you don't.", "apparently you like that she's independent unless it means her doing something without you, very immature of you.\n\n>She told me that I was being an AH for expecting her to revolve her life and plans only around a boyfriend of two months and she is fine doing things with or without me.\n\nshe's completely right about this.\n\nYTA, grow up.", "YTA and honestly this notion that you have that your girlfriend should have to drop any hobbies that don't revolve around you is both laudable and terrifying. Way to demonstrate what a controlling, manipulative boyfriend you want to be right out of the gate.", "YTA - it's been 2 months slow down there buddy. Even after 2 years, she is allowed to have a life outside of you. I'd argue that's a healthy thing to do.", "YTA she should cancel her plans she made without you, because you are in her life ? Don\u2018t expect to be in her life very long.", "YTA she has these plans before you and she will\nHave them after you. Don\u2019t push your need to show off to your family on her, she likes musicals you don\u2019t, seems like She made yes right call", "YTA - op, this is toxic 101. She has plans, they don\u2019t change because you\u2019re in her life. You\u2019re selfish and not mature enough to be in a relationship.

You expect your brand new girlfriend to start revolving her life around you and your family's plans. Keep pressuring her, and she'll realise she's much better of without you.\n\nIt's and *honor* to be invited to your family's lakehouse. LMAO", "YTA. The first positive quality of hers you list is that she's independent, but you don't want her to do things without you? You've only been dating a couple of months, but even people who have been married for decades have separate interests and do things without their partners.", "YTA. She offered a perfectly reasonable solution to everything you said. Do you not do anything without her? Surely you have your own interests and hobbies that you enjoy alone or with friends? She is a whole person, not an accessory to your life, and it's gross to expect her to stop doing things she enjoys because you don't. Not to mention how creepy this comes off after dating for two months!", "Yes YTA - for a myriad of reasons.", "YTA. Not only are you clingy and needy, but seem to want to be controlling as well.

Because they're not an asshole, we're still together and have seen several more musicals. You certainly aren't Hamilton-worthy, but absolutely YTA. This woman loves musicals, and not only are you unwilling to accompany her, but you want to forbid her from going alone. You've been in her life all of 2 months. She doesn't need you and would be better off without you.", "Wow YTA, for MANY reasons. \n\n1. She had plans made before your plans, you asked her to cancel them, she said no, YET YOU STILL CONTINUE TO ASK. No means no.\n2. You want her to cancel plans because YOU aren't interested? So What? She IS interested in them. She's not making you go, so don't go and be happy.\n3. You've only been together TWO MONTHS- she's likely going to have plans made before you and it's weird that you think she shouldn't go now \"because she has a boyfriend\". It's not like she's taking an ex or going to an orgy. \n4. This is most important here- Even if you were together for years- YOU DON'T OWN HER OR ALL HER TIME. \n\nYou have a learning opportunity here- Stop being a weird, controlling boyfriend or I hope she sees the red flags for what they are.", "YTA.

If you want to actually have a relationship with her, back off.", "YTA. You don't want her to do things without you, but you also don't want to go see a musical. So she's supposed to just give up something she enjoys forever so that you don't have to be alone for a couple of days or be annoyed for a few hours?", "YTA.

What exactly are you bringing to the table?", "Of course YTA. Do you have no self awareness?", "If she\u2019s smart she\u2019ll ghost you. This has needy all over it", "YTA. No, it's not weird for her to do things she paid for, planned months ahead, and was excited to do lmao it's not her job as your girlfriend to suddenly drop everything and do whatever you want.

Either get over yourself or do her a favor and break up with her. I've been in a similar position, I've had similar thoughts to yours. You're not ready for a relationship. Break up with her and let her have a good life. You're not in a place where you should be dating. I recognize I've it because I was just there recently and am still working my way out of it.

You\u2019re going to lose her if you keep it up. I love musical\u2019s, husband not so much. Pre-pandemic I would get two season tickets, and then go with whoever I thought would like a show. Normally two with each kid, one or two with one of my parents, and my husband would go to one or two because even though he isn\u2019t keen on them, he is keen on me.

You said it yourself that your gf has always been independent and yet now you think she shouldn\u2019t continue to do the things that interest her solo just because she\u2019s suddenly dating you? C\u2019mon with that bullshit.\n\nGrow up, OP, and realize her world is never going to revolve around you.", "YTA and she's right. You're being weird and controlling right now. Back off or you're going to be an ex super quick.", "YTA youve been dating two months. Calm down. Even if youve been dating longer, like you said she's independant. Im assuming you started dating her because you liked this about her. If you start dating only to want to change and mold her into someone you want then your delusional. She doesnt have to answer to you. After two months you csnt expect to knoe every detail about someone and it is possible for some things to slip her mind. I highly doubt she's hiding anything and her life doesnt have to revolve around you. You dont have to do everything together and it is healthy to have some independance from each other. Grow up. We're 2023 noe, she doesnt need a male escort to go out in public let alone see a musical.", "She loves musical but you hate it.\n\nAfter 2 months, you feel hurtful she plan activities without you.\n\nEven if she cancel this one. In future, would you go with her or would you be okay that she goes by herself.\n\nIf answer is no on both count, stop wasting each other time.", "YTA. Please make sure you bind her feet and render them useless before forbidding her from doing things by herself please and thank you.", "I hope she\u2019s spraying herself with static guard bc you are TOO clingy.", "YTA for sure.  She won\u2019t be your gf for long with that sort of attitude. It\u2019s healthy to have your own interests and hobbies separate to your relationship.

Do you realize how demanding that is?

You love her independence but are upset at the concept of her going to activities that interest her without you.

Meanwhile, you refuse to even compromise and join her at the shows because you don\u2019t like musicals. So you don\u2019t want her to go. When is she allowed to go see musicals? Is she allowed other hobbies you\u2019re not interested in? Will you go out to things you enjoy even if she\u2019s not interested?\n\nThis is controlling behaviour and a massive red flag.", "Let me get this straight. You don\u2019t want her to do these thing alone because she has a boyfriend, but also don\u2019t want to do them with her because you don\u2019t like these things? Yeah YTA. Also the idea of meeting your family at 2 months into dating is wild to me", "YTA a mega one at that. She offered you to join her in what makes her happy and instead you want her to quit what makes her happy because you're not interested in it? Good thing you're showing your colors now and I hope she dumps your selfish a$$", "YTA. It's been two months and you're already a walking red flag.

Using your warped logic, she could reasonably demand that you skip your family trip to hang out with her that weekend. Don't you know you have a girlfriend?\n\nYou write about liking that she is \"independent,\" but for some reason it bothers you that she is willing to do things (like see shows) in pursuit of her happiness. It sounds like you only like her independence until it mildlly inconveniences you. She didn't even refuse to meet your family, she just said she couldn't make the specific date.\n\nThat she is fine to spend the weekend without you, while YOU do something you want to do (go to the lake house) while she follows through on plans she is excited about (seeing a show that she will love but that you probably wouldn't enjoy) means that she is, as you put it, an independent and nice person. You should feel lucky to be dating somebody like that. If you want a girlfriend at your beck and call, then maybe what you need is one of those AI girlfriends, because you seem confused about the realities of dating another human.\n\nThe kicker on your post is that you have developed these expecations TWO MONTHS into a relationship. This will NEVER be an appropriate thing to expect of your partner, probably even if you are married someday. If the family gathering were EXTREMELY IMPORTANT (very hard to think of something important enough, but just think top-tier, once-in-a-lifetime stuff), and if she were already A PART OF THAT FAMILY, then an expectation like this might enter the realm of not being completely ridiculous.\n\nYou sound like you're fixing to get yourself dumped, so my immediate recommendation is that you fall on your sword, explain that you understand you were wrong, and beg for her forgiveness.

BARELY a girlfriend.\n\nShe is independent and you like that.\n\nBut you don't like her independency if it excludes you. After only being together 2 months.\n\nYou expect her to cancel everything she wants to do since before she met you, because\n1) you think your family is more important\n2) you don't like musicals\n3) she never talked to you about musicals\n\nSo for number 1) although it's nice that you want her to meet your family I'll recommend you to wait a bit more, firstly because she is within her rights to choose to go to a previously booked event, and that doesn't make her a bad girlfriend not person. Secondly because I'm not sure she will want to keep the relationship with you after this.\n\nFor number 2) WHO CARES THAT'S YOU DON'T LIKE MUSICALS YOU ARE NOT INVITED, NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING YOU LIKE... GUESS WHAT... DO IT YOURSELF!!!! You are 26 you cannot be this insecure.\n\nFor number 3) you have been together for two months, there are thousands of things she hasn't talked to you about. And now she knows she can't because you are going to shit in everything she likes and impose your preferences over what she wants.\n\nMy man, your girlfriend sound amazing and you sound very insecure. Personally I don't think you deserve her, and I only needed this short post to reach that conclusion. However, it's not too late to grow a pair and understand that having a independent girlfriend means she is going to do and enjoy things without you and that's AMAZING because then she'll have more to her that you will enjoy, whether it is because she talks to you about things or just because her overall attitude gets better with her independence. You should encourage her to keep it up.\n\nThere is nothing worse than a relationship where the people are totally dependent on each other, that means they have no personality nor goals of their own. That's not healthy, if you are a decent guy, you don't what that for your girlfriend or for you.\n\nIf you need a girl that appeases your insecurities and is dependent on you, please PLEASE break it up with this woman and do not date any human ever. I don't think this is you, I think you are better.\n\n\nStill, now YTA.", "Okay, so a 2 part answer. \nYTA for expecting her to change plans or change who she is, and who she is, is the person you liked in the first place. \nYou don't like musicals,  be happy, she didn't try to drag you to them, and is happy to go without you. \nNTA, for liking her well enough to introduce her to your family, and she did say she'd like to meet them also.

She has a right to have a life and make plans on her own, and to ask her to drop those expensive and exciting plans over her 2-month relationship is ridiculous.

So it\u2019s your way or no way? And now that she\u2019s in a relationship she can\u2019t be an individual? \n\nYou sound controlling. If I were her I probably wouldn\u2019t reconsidering the relationship if my partner is requesting I don\u2019t do anything on my own because we are in a relationship.

I gave up drinking for my then gf now wife after we dated for only a few weeks, but that was my choice. She had said that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable around drinking and that when I had been doing so just to give her a heads up so we could talk on a different day, and I decided I didn\u2019t want to do it any more.

There is never a rush to introduce each other to families if you see each other in your future. She bought the tickets beforehand, was apologetic, and offered to find a solution, yet you feel this ain\u2019t right? Just because you are together doesn\u2019t automatically mean you are required to be with each other all the time.

If you guys got married, it would be normal for both of you to occasionally do things without each other. It is extremely weird for you to think she would cancel all the tickets to all the Broadway shows she previously bought.

Things are going really great. She\u2019s quite independent, funny, smart, and just all around a nice person. \n\nLast weekend, my mom called me to tell me she, my dad, and my sister would be going to our lake house (about two hours from where we are) for a weekend in a few weeks and asked if I could come. I was for it and my mom mentioned that if I wanted to bring my girlfriend I could. I know it could be a little early, but I was excited for her to meet them and I knew they\u2019d love her. \n\nI asked my girlfriend about it and she thanked me, but wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it. She had previously bought tickets to a touring Broadway show months before we started dating and it was going to be the weekend my family would be at the lake. I asked her if she\u2019d consider skipping it to meet my family, but she told me the tickets were nonrefundable and it was a show she wanted to see at least once live. She expressed she would love to meet my family and suggested that maybe we work something out at a later date. I thought it was weird that she never mentioned it and asked if someone was going with her. She said no, which honestly isn\u2019t unusual. Like I said she\u2019s pretty independent and has done a lot of activities and trips by herself. However, I found it weird that it hadn\u2019t come up and to her it wasn\u2019t something that she felt she had to bring up since our conversations never really brought up musicals. I asked her again if she would consider skipping it and once again she said no. She apologized for not being upfront about it and definitely saw where I was coming from with that. She also then told me she had tickets for several other shows in the coming months and I asked her if she was planning on doing those alone. She said she was because she bought the tickets before we were dating and once again couldn\u2019t get a refund. Nor did she want to. \n\nI told her I found it hurtful she would do things that didn\u2019t include me and wouldn\u2019t consider canceling them since she had a boyfriend. She said she\u2019d be happy to see if we could get another ticket for me to join, but honestly I hate musicals. Is it weird that she is doing this? Am I really asking too much for her to not do things by herself since we are together now? She told me that I was being an AH for expecting her to revolve her life and plans only around a boyfriend of two months and she is fine doing things with or without me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. You hate musicals but you want her to cancel her tickets because she\u2019s not going to them with you? That\u2019s unreasonable. Is she supposed to only do things you like, with you?", "YTA. There is no need for her to tell you about the tickets she bought for future events, and the way you imply you think she is making it up is strange. You have been dating for two months. That's a matter of weeks. You are seriously jumping the gun with your expectations.", "YTA. The first thing you listed about her was that she\u2019s independent. But you think she should give that up to be with you? She\u2019s going to see musicals. She\u2019s likely paid hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars for all those tickets. No, she should not give that up because \u201cshe has a boyfriend\u201d. A boyfriend should be happy his girlfriend is able to see something she loves and isn\u2019t pushing him to go if he\u2019s not interested in it. \n\nYour expectations are unreasonable and unhealthy in a relationship. You should be able to go out with the guys, see a movie with your sibling, go camping with a friend etc. just like she should be able to go to the theatre. It goes both ways. Just because you enjoy spending time together shouldn\u2019t mean you can never spend time apart.", "YTA. Are you expecting to live in each other's pockets now?", "Dude are you the asshole. First, why would she cancel plans to meet your parents? They have a lake house 2 hours away, so it\u2019s not like the opportunity is not going to come up again. When she said no, that should have been the end of it. \n\nSecond, why would you harangue her about not having told you about the tickets? There was nothing to be \u201cupfront\u201d about and she had nothing to apologize for. \n\nThird, the idea that you think she should stop doing something she enjoys, going to musicals, because you don\u2019t want to go? Honestly, wtf dude? She\u2019s not your pet or your prize, she\u2019s a full human with her own interests. Honestly I hope this conversation opened her eyes to what a controlling person you are and she spends more time at Broadway shows and not with you.\n\nEdit: forgot to include YTA for the judgment \ud83d\ude05", "YTA. These are plans she made BEFORE you started dating. You expect her to cancel her activities, which she loves, because you \u201chate musicals\u201d. Is she only allowed to do things now that you like? This makes no sense. Are you going to give up the things that you enjoy if she doesn\u2019t like them?", "Dude..  YTA you need to chill. You're a couple months in, and you expect her to have given you her whole calendar.", "YTA. You\u2019ve only been dating for 2 months, and you already sound too clingy.\n\n\u201cI found it hurtful she would do things that didn\u2019t include me,\u201d how old are you again? Did you mean to type 16 instead of 26? \n\nSetting that aside your plans with your parents were fairly last second, while she\u2019s literally had those non-refundable tickets since well before you even starting dating.

I wouldn\u2019t be changing my plans for someone I had only been dating for two months either, particularly over hard to get tickets.", "YTA - It's healthy to have both joint and separate interests/activities in a relationship.  It's not healthy to expect her to give up everything and spend all her time with you. She is willing to include you but rather than let her do something she enjoys alone, you want her to stop going because you don't like musicals?! That's ridiculous and controlling. If her being willing to spend time without you, really feels hurtful to you then doing your own counseling would be a good way to work through that issue.", "I mean\u2026you realize it\u2019s normal (even healthy!) to have your own interests and activities when in a relationship, right? YTA for suggesting otherwise.\n\nIt stinks it doesn\u2019t align to your parents plans, but why not plan a weekend she doesn\u2019t have booked with other activities for them to meet her. Expecting her to change her plans that were made months in advance is unreasonable and selfish.", "YTA - do you know how much some tickets can cost?? And how hard it can be to get tickets to certain shows? \n\nShe made these plans before she knew you existed, she does these outings for herself, to make herself happy and you are pouting and saying it's not fair? \nShe offers to get you to come along and you're stomping your foot, \"I dawnt wyke dat!\" So? It's not all about you! Relationships need balance. \n\nYou can't be living in one another's pockets.", "\u201c Am I really asking too much for her to not do things by herself since we are together now? \u201d\n\nYes, totally! And very much YTA, OP.", "Jesus, you sound like such an asshole. A weekend getaway is not the first place you should be introducing someone to your family first of all. But secondly, she had plans for something that cost her money. It\u2019s not on her to change those plans because you\u2019re suddenly going away. You\u2019re being incredibly selfish and your comment about \u201cwhat is a tiny award\u201d is ignorant and lazy. You\u2019re just argumentative and selfish. Grow the fuck up. YTA.", "Bless your heart. This sounds like this is your first relationship. At two months in, there are no expectations of full disclosure of what is on the calendar because it\u2019s too soon to tell if it will last. You are still determining compatibility, which is weak at this point since you two have differing opinions on her autonomy. YTA.", "You probably should go see some musicals", "YTA. I am also extremely independent and run into this problem all the time with men when I try to date them. They pretend to be ok when I tell them that I take trips or go to concerts or whatever on my own, and then they get all kinds of offended very early on when they're not included in my plans.
