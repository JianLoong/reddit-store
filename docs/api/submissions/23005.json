So far we have had a brief argument about it and she is now refusing to speak to me.\n\nHere's how it happened: we both arrived and watched an act that went on for about an hour. We both needed to use the toilet before the next act so we started queueing. They had urinals which were obviously quicker so when we got close to the front for the portaloos we agreed that I would go and piss and then go and buy some drinks from the bar tent, and we would meet by the tree. The tree is the same tree we used as a meeting point the previous night.\n\nWhat actually happened is, I went to the bar, my card declined (too many contactless uses, and I couldnt connect to my banking app as we were in the middle of buttfuck nowhere) so I immediately left and went to the tree where we agreed to meet. This took all of 5 minutes as there was no queue at the bar.\n\nI arrive at the tree, no girlfriend to be seen. I call her name, I try to call her phone, a few times it rings, a few times it just beeps and says no signal (we are in a field in buttfuck nowhere).\n\nAt this point I'm panicking as it's dark, its very busy and I'm wondering \"is she looking for me in the crowd? Is she at the bar looking for me? How tf are we going to find eachother?\"\n\nShe is not panicking.\n\nEventually after around 30 minutes, I find her trying to call me from the edge of the crowd for the next act completely by chance. She tells me she came out from the toilet and couldn't find me so she went and got on one of those slingshot bungee rides with a complete stranger that she met by the tree where she waited for me for 4 minutes before deciding I was a lost cause.\n\nI am genuinely hurt that she left me, in the pissing rain, after waiting for 4 minutes, to walk away with a complete stranger and go on a ride, to return 25-30 minutes later and I'm not exaggerating by saying she couldn't care less. She said to me word for word \"Well, you weren't there.\"\n\nWe have been together for almost 7 years and I have never been so hurt by her behaviour. \n\nShe is telling me that because I didn't make a big deal about it at the festival or on the shuttle bus back to the city that I am an asshole for pretending that everything is okay (I didn't want to air my dirty laundry in public, the irony isn't lost on me). She also denies any wrongdoing and insists its all down to no phone signal and that I said I didn't want to go on that ride with her (not my cup of tea) so she went with someone who would. \n\nI kicked up a fuss once we arrived back at the hotel and she completely ignored me and just started getting ready for bed, so I stormed out (immature of me I know) but she then started to text me, which lead to a brief argument in person which culminated in the silent treatment, which makes me feel like TA, but I'm not sure.\n\nAm I overreacting?

It's not my place to say *how much* this upsets you or causes a rift between you two.  That is something you'll have to work out together.
