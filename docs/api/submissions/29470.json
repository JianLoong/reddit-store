He always complimented me on my skills and I loved his passion for the sport *and* for historical festivals.\n\nI would say my costuming skills are meh, but I'm a pretty good skater. When my bf and I first started dating, I felt like he really respected my shredding ability. Recently though, I felt something change. He stopped wanting to practice together, and has started giving me the cold shoulder. Once, he told me that he had to go see an anesthesiologist, so I decided to practice at our local skate park and I saw him there practicing without me!\n\nHe doesn't have to practice with me, but I was hurt that he lied. The only thing that has happened in between his change in behavior was that we participated in a recent regional skating competition together. I actually ended up placing in our event, but my boyfriend was quiet the whole time and only gave me one \"congratulations\" before disappearing. He didn't text me for 2 days, even after I called him, and has behaved weird ever since.\n\nOur disagreement happened because of the 'Ren 'Faire we recently attended. Last year he showered me in compliments due to my costume, but this year he didn't give me a single one before delving into my anachronisms. I always appreciate feedback to help me grow, but I felt a little deflated by his immediate criticisms.\n\nOur schtick at the 'Ren 'Faires is that we skateboard in our costumes. People get a huge kick out of it, and there are usually a lot of them getting our pictures or filming us for videos. It can be a lot but most of the time I think it's all fun, so I play along.\n\nThis year I felt particularly enthusiastic because of my recent win, so I might have been showing off a little more than usual. To be fair, there were a lot of young girls who were really excited to see me with my skateboard, and they were asking me a lot of questions so of course I wanted to help them.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend started scolding me when driving me back to my apartment after the event, saying that I \"humiliated\" him. He started saying things like \"people were pointing and whispering\" at him and that several girls laughed at him. I was pretty shocked to hear all of this because I didn't think  people were really paying any attention to him at all. To be honest, while I was answering questions or pulling tricks for some pictures, he was standing 10 feet away on his phone. I don't even know if people knew we were dating.\n\nBut my boyfriend was really upset about it and said that, as an apology, I should give up skating for 3 months. I'm leaving it up to Reddit. If I'm the asshole, I'll go through with it and apologize.", "created_utc": 1697998657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dzkph/aita_for_skating_at_a_renaissance_faire_and/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would think the only reason you'd see one outside of having surgery is for some pretty chronic severe pain. Idk if something got left out of this story or something, but it sounds like there's something up with him to make such a drastic change in behavior so quickly for no reason.", "NTA- he seems jealous and wanting to punish you for it. Do you want to deal with this in a relationship? Lie, punish, shame you? You are inspiring other women to skate. He should be proud! \n\nAnd congrats for placing!!", "NTA. First of all, you should never have to apologize for success. Second, giving up something you love for 3 months is not an apology - it's a punishment. Your BF is punishing you for being successful at something that the two of you share - apparently he feels better than he is. And, rather than being happy at the success of someone he loves, he is jealous. this means, in this relationship, you are not meant to be an equal, but are meant to only meant to be arm candy that makes *him* look good as opposed to someone with her own ambitions and successes.\n\nYou deserve better in life - you deserve someone who will celebrate your successes, not try and punish you for them. \n\nAlso, keep doing what you are doing - those girls who were excited to see you are also possibly ones who will be inspired by you to do something exceptional themselves.", "NTA your boyfriend is almost 30yrs old and upset that you a girl is better than him, time to get a new boyfriend who isn't an asshole", "NTA- \nYou're obviously a great skater, and your bfs ego/self-esteem has been deflated by your skating achievements.

Skating is a passion of yours. He's only wanting you to give it up temporarily because hes again jealous of your skill in it. Itll give him some time to catch up and make you out of practice. Honestly go to couple counseling, or confront him on his behavior. \n\nPersonally i would suggest you think whether you want to be with someone that could diminish your light and joy you have through your passions. Wouldn't you rather have someone who praises you when you shine in the spotlight, rather than someone that festers disdain in the shadow of it. Because a real loved one wouldnt care about whether you stand proud in one, whether they too were in it or not.", "NTA.

Honestly, young women, take it from an old woman: if any guy is 'humiliated' because you're better at something than he is, dump him immediately. Don't waste your time on him.

He's gaslighting you with the \"People were pointing and whispering\", trying to make you feel like you were to blame.  \n\nYou need to think about this. You're insecure yourself if you think you're anyway in the wrong This means he's been working on you for a while.

Someone who really loves you for you will always encourage you to do better and show praise when you do even if you surpass them.
