When my bf and I first started dating, I felt like he really respected my shredding ability. Recently though, I felt something change. He stopped wanting to practice together, and has started giving me the cold shoulder. Once, he told me that he had to go see an anesthesiologist, so I decided to practice at our local skate park and I saw him there practicing without me!\n\nHe doesn't have to practice with me, but I was hurt that he lied. The only thing that has happened in between his change in behavior was that we participated in a recent regional skating competition together. I actually ended up placing in our event, but my boyfriend was quiet the whole time and only gave me one \"congratulations\" before disappearing. He didn't text me for 2 days, even after I called him, and has behaved weird ever since.\n\nOur disagreement happened because of the 'Ren 'Faire we recently attended. Last year he showered me in compliments due to my costume, but this year he didn't give me a single one before delving into my anachronisms. I always appreciate feedback to help me grow, but I felt a little deflated by his immediate criticisms.\n\nOur schtick at the 'Ren 'Faires is that we skateboard in our costumes. People get a huge kick out of it, and there are usually a lot of them getting our pictures or filming us for videos. It can be a lot but most of the time I think it's all fun, so I play along.\n\nThis year I felt particularly enthusiastic because of my recent win, so I might have been showing off a little more than usual. To be fair, there were a lot of young girls who were really excited to see me with my skateboard, and they were asking me a lot of questions so of course I wanted to help them.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend started scolding me when driving me back to my apartment after the event, saying that I \"humiliated\" him. He started saying things like \"people were pointing and whispering\" at him and that several girls laughed at him. I was pretty shocked to hear all of this because I didn't think  people were really paying any attention to him at all. To be honest, while I was answering questions or pulling tricks for some pictures, he was standing 10 feet away on his phone. I don't even know if people knew we were dating.\n\nBut my boyfriend was really upset about it and said that, as an apology, I should give up skating for 3 months. I'm leaving it up to Reddit.
