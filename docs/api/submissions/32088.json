I\u2019ve been a SAHM before and by the time the kids were the ages yours are now, throwing together a weeknight dinner was something I was able to accomplish pretty easily on a regular basis.

If she doesn't mind cooking but has no time cause of cleaning after kids, hire a maid/housecleaner to help out so she has time free to cook. Of she doesn't really like cooking, hire someone to do meal prepping st the beginning of the week so you have meals ready to grab during the week. You can help do lots of chopping snd prepping together on the weekend so during the week the ingredients for various meals are basically prepped and measured and all she has to do is combine them correctly.

It\u2019s a lot of work, yes, but it\u2019s absolutely doable.", "The kids are 7 at the youngest, and 16 on the oldest end. They're in school for most of the day before OP gets home. Hell, good chance one of the kids is already working a part time job. Gift planning and clothes shopping? Come on. The guy's bringing in 200k a year. It's not like they're scraping by and they really have to pinch pennies for this stuff.", "It's wild that this woman living in a home and does absolutely nothing including providing dinner for her kids and the response is I'm impressed.", "> the amount that you earn is irrelevant as there's very few jobs more demanding than full time parenting.\n\nThis entire sentence in your comment is *irrelevant* if you weren\u2019t referring to OP\u2019s wife with the \u201cfull time parenting\u201d part.", "I hate working even more!", "There's also a lot of single parents that work full time jobs, do all the housework, and STILL manage to make dinner for their kids. It doesn't have to be gourmet cuisine, but there are plenty of simple meals you can make.", "True. And growing up, my mom worked a full-time job, did all the cooking and cleaning, I did the outside chores (lawn mowing, car washing, etc), and my dad worked and watched football and movies. And now they're divorced and my dad pays 25k a year in alimony till he dies.\n\nJust cause other people can and have done things, doesn't mean every relationship can and should do those same things. There's far more diversity in relationships and potential roles that warrant more than just assuming a freeloader. Even the OP said he didn't think she was freeloading and didn't want to minimize her work with the kids and at home. \n\nBut he IS asking for a change from what he signed up for. And it's gotten to a point where resentment is starting to set it it seems like. Time for counseling and reworking expectations in the marriage.\n\nMy opinion? I don't think he's an a-hole for wanting food and wanting to minimize work after a 10 hour workday (plus commutes). I don't think she's an a-hole for not wanting to suddenly learn to cook seemingly out of the blue. I DO think they have some talks to be had, and options to be considered.", "Sorry if the sarcasm isn't obvious.\n\nGetting kids to do chores is not inherently a bad thing. But I assume that someone is doing some shopping for food, preparing some amount of food, doing emotional labor, remembering birthdays, planning social calendars, talking to the school, arranging repairs for cars, house, etc., shopping for household etc.\n\nThe work may not be equitable but I highly doubt the 16 year old is doing all this. And, unless OP says otherwise, I'm extremely doubtful the wife is literally sitting on her ass doing nothing all day.\n\nIf indeed the wife really is doing nothing, I kinda have to go with ESH, in part because OP let this situation get way out of hand, likely for years, with his spouse.", "so you completely ignored the modifier. Genius.", "I really love my job, so my husband would have to make a lot of money to make it worth it for me to not work so that I can at least hire a cleaning lady for the bathroom. But there's nothing to do where we live so I'd go crazy staying at home, so I think I actually need to work.", "This is an even better point than mine haha", "They do have to have some talks I agree. \nAnd I also don\u2019t condone the scenario you described. I don\u2019t think just bringing home the money entitles someone to just sit around and be lazy and never help out.  So hopefully my post didn\u2019t come across as that.", "He comes home the majority by 5.30. It\u2019s not out of the blue when he msgs her when he\u2019s on his way home.\n\nYou can whip something up in an hour or less. It\u2019s not hard to cook. Especially for someone that has raised 3 kids who are in school now.", "You are grasping at straws here. No, there is not all this mental load BS with three kids that age. Sure there is laundry but it doesn\u2019t take all day. Sure there is cleaning but if the kids do the chores what is there left. \n\nRemembering birthdays and appointments is called a calendar. The 16 year old could possibly even drive themselves places. \n\nYes I have also three kids. They are slightly younger. I have a grasp of that it takes.", "My ex was a very involved dad, so I didn't think of myself as a single parent - but I was still working full-time and had my son 12 of 14 days in any two-week period.", "Like I wrote:\n\nIf indeed the wife really is doing nothing, I kinda have to go with ESH, in part because OP let this situation get way out of hand, likely for years, with his spouse."]}
