Perhaps you can take care of a meal on the weekend, she once during the week, and you invest in some simple meal kits like HelloFresh she can prepare.\n\nInstead of sniping at each other, sit down and plan this out. NTA, even if you think you are entitled to a home-cooked meal, and maybe you are, I don't think that approach will win her over to your thinking.

I think even if she's not cooking elaborate things from scratch if possible she should have something both for you and the kids to eat, but it's probably worth having a chat with her about what her blockers are with cooking. Is it that she hates it, or it got to a point when the kids were small where it was too overwhelming trying to cook and handle several kids and she never got back into the habit? As much as I want to say \"she should have dinner on for you when you get home\" because if you're out the house for 12 hours a day and up at stupid o clock in the morning, if she can make your day easier it's a nice loving thing to do for your partner so I can only assume that for some reason or another cooking is just one of these tasks that is harder for her than other people.

If your stay-at-home partner is \"naturally tending to\" the children every day while taking care of the household chores and probably other things like curating shopping lists for 4 other people and managing bills, they probably already fed the kids more than once that day. Maybe they thought the only other adult in the house would be able to feed himself?\n\nYour wife if not your mother. Have you ever cooked dinner for her?

I have no reason to lie to people I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m contemplating a divorce.  The kids, who are literally (in the correct use of the word) are the reason I get up in the morning, are the only reason I\u2019m not packing my bags at this point.  \n\nWe have been married for 23 years and together for 26. We know each other like the back of our hands. I messed up about 15 years ago and let\u2019s call it a mid life crisis.  Our oldest (daughter) was extremely young and I felt it was them vs me.  I communicated this very thoroughly to my wife and she appreciated it\u2026 but nothing changed.  I felt betrayed over the years as our 2 boys came into this world and anytime I brought it up she was immediately defensive and so what does one do in that situation?  I shut my mouth and didn\u2019t bring it up again.\n\nShe\u2019s never worked\u2026 let me clarify, she\u2019s worked about 5% of the time in our marriage.  My philosophy has always been \u201cbe productive and do right by me and our children and I have no issues\u201d.  And I genuinely have NEVER made her feel lesser than myself because of work, even though she worked very little  for 10 years, prior to our 16 year old being born. \n\nShe\u2019s never cooked regularly, she\u2019s never cleaned regularly, and she has never worked a steady job/went to school.  And yes we\u2019ve had conversations about this over the years.\n\nI\u2019m no angel and don\u2019t portray to be, BUT, I\u2019ve always brought a paycheck in, have always been there for my kids, always tended to her emotional and sexual needs, and have always come straight home after work.  I don\u2019t believe in going to a bar, a friend\u2019s house, etc after work.\n\nI did have an emotional affair (10 years ago), as did she at one point in our marriage .  I\u2019ve been extremely loyal, perhaps to a fault, other than a nine month, emotional affair.\n\nFast forward to the here and now: she is in an online college after I explained these kids are getting too expensive to only have 1 income. She could do her school work in about 3 hours a day (in her own words) but she procrastinates and ends up having to do a months worth of assignments in 3 days, which stresses her out and in turn chaos ensues.  The kids do all the chores. (Laundry, dishes, etc). She is on social media at least 3 hours during the day.  Typical day: she gets up about 7, gets the kids up, makes sure the boys are presentable, they get on the bus, she\u2019s on social media until about 11, does online shopping or reads fictional novels until about 2, 50/50 chance at her doing school work, asks me when I\u2019ll be home (99% of the time it\u2019s like clockwork - leave at 4:30 - home at 5:45), has the kids finish their chores.  I come home, find something to eat, and am in bed by 8:30 to get up at 3:45 to leave by 4:45.  Weekends are a hodgepodge of various activities, IF I don\u2019t have to work.\n\nI\u2019ve explained to her I\u2019m emotionally and physically drained and she suggested individual and marriage counseling. I\u2019ve been seeing a counselor for about 6 months and she hasn\u2019t looked for one.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and to make sure I\u2019m not some asshole with delusions of grandeur, made this post.  (Some very interesting comments from folks) I don\u2019t want to be away from my kids or her for that matter.  But I\u2019m not on a good space and quite honestly scared to leave.  We\u2019ve been together for over half our lives.  And the thought of leaving used to bring me tears and now it instead makes me anxious.\n\nSo there it b is.. that\u2019s about as much detail as I can think of at 6:30 in the morning.

I would cook the first couple of nights (fri -sun) and portion out and freeze the rest so that all I had to do on my \"can't be f'ed cooking\" nights I already had something there that just needed defrosting and reheating. \n\nWhen the kids got older I started doing freezer slow cooker meals where I can just prep the meal in a bag or container, freeze it, and get it out the night before so it could defrost ready for the slow cooker in the morning.

How horrible... This is why people grow up not wanting to have kids because they feel like they were already forced to be a parent to their siblings. And why kids stop talking to their parents.\n\nIt is not your child's responsibility to make sure their siblings eat. They didn't sign up to be parents. I bet the 16 year old has to run errands and haul the 10 year old around too, huh?\n\nYour kids are all school age. Your wife is not \"caring for them\" when they're in school. What the hell is she doing all day that she feels she deserves to be such a monumental failure as a parent and partner?", "OP, to put it bluntly, your kids are being abused through both neglect and parentification. This is not healthy physically or mentally. Do any of these things sound like your kids:\n\n* over or underweight, possibly sick frequently or with bad dental\n\n* picky eaters, mostly will only eat junk food\n\n* either hyper responsible or defiant/bullies\n\n* high anxiety or seeming checked out\n\n* could be doing better in school OR obsessed with being perfect in school\n\n* possibly a bit unkempt looking in some way\n\n* get along better with adults than kids of their own age\n\nI'm not convinced even hiring someone to help the kids would so anything right now, even if you weren't stretched thin financially. Do you think your wife would find a way to give them more work? That's the impression I get. \n\nDo some research on these issues:\n\n* talk to the kids teachers. They often have insight and likely highly suspect if not outright know what's going on even if you haven't told them before\n\n* talk to the kids each individually about what's going on, starting with the eldest. Take them out of the house to do this so they don't feel like Mom might be listening.\n\n* if the kids haven't been having their annual doctor visits, take them each for a physical. Dental is another priority if that hasn't happened in over a year. You may find they're worse off than even they thought.\n\n* do some more research on all you've learned and prepare to preserve that to your wife however you think it'll best likely go over. The kids teachers and medical professionals can help advise this too. And I recommend meeting the school counselor, seeing if they seem safe (not all are), and if they are please inform them what's going on, and encourage your kids to talk to the counselor. Even if that means they stay after school. \n\nThen you need to have a long hard conversation with your wife- ideally when the kids aren't home(if you have family or they have friends in the area they like stay with, have them all out visiting the same night?). If your wife doesn't seem to care how this is impacting her kids enough to at the very least work together to schedule a couples counselor that week (getting on the schedule, obviously it might be a way time longer than a week), then it would be way healthier for you to get them out of there and divorce. Perhaps you could move closer to work with a smaller place, so you can be home more. Even if the kids have the same amount of chores, at least they'll see you're acknowledging what they've been going through and are trying to help them. \n\nIf through moving, assistance, or your wife being legally forced to get a job and send you money, you can afford a part time nanny, do that with prio being them cooking dinner and prepping healthy lunches for the kids. And nanny or not, start cooking with the kids. If you don't know how to cook well, take some classes together. The more you do now, the more prepared for adulthood the kids will be, the physically healthier they will be, and the less therapy they'll need as adults (they'd definitely benefit from it now too).\n\nI know that's all terrifying. Especially if you have to leave. But you're not happy and I guarantee the kids aren't really happy-- even if they're complacent because it's all they know, they're not thriving and eventually when they're older they'll realize how fucked up they had it. You all deserve better. And while things will be even harder at first, they'll eventually get easier when you're not basically living the life of Sisyphus in a household that sounds like it has no love or warmth.", "My mom called it \u201cscrounging\u201d just dig through the pantry and eat snacks for dinner.

Anything I was making for myself and my husband they were open to (so long as it wasn\u2019t spicy, I didn\u2019t give them anything like that). Now they refuse just about anything that isn\u2019t fruit, yogurt, buttered pasta or chicken tenders cooked in the toaster oven. Even if something is prepared differently than usual or it\u2019s a different shape of pasta they will refuse.

If food is so easy to make, why can't everyone in the household fend for themselves?\n\nI honestly believe that the real issue here is whether the adults in the home *value* having a cooked dinner.\n\nI grew up in a \"fend for yourself\" type of house once we were 10ish or so.  House was always stocked with canned goods, heat&eat freezer meals, sandwich stuff, and salad fixings.  When a parent cooked something it really wasn't much fancier than that.\n\nI think the OP and the wife have different base expectations for what it means to take care of dinner. And they should probably have a real conversation about it.", "He\u2019s presumably worked the past 16 years as well. She could still have most of the day free AND make or arrange food for dinner. Hell if my husband is going to be home late sometimes I give the kids something they like, then just throw chicken or some meat/protein in the air fryer (or boil or poach eggs) and just do some boil in the bag rice, and make it into a rice bowl with salad/veggies, let him choose his sauce on top (does he want it to be tex mex or asian flavourings?) \n\nI literally just have to put the rice in a pot of boiling water and put the meat in and turn on the air fryer, and take the salad/veggies out of the fridge. Then later plate it up. It\u2019s not difficult. It takes minutes and very little effort if I make sure I have stuff like that in the house.", "Jesus, I don't think you understand how incredibly neglectful that is.

Is there a physical reason Your wife cannot cook meals for her family?  Having them \"fend for themselves\" when an abled body PARENT is home seems really neglectful. What is she so busy with?? You work a 10 hour shift, with 2 hour commute and then have to cook too.... again, What is she so busy with?

What the fuck.", "If this feels healthy and these are the kinds of eating habits you want for your kids as they grow and have their own families, then keep things as is. I grew up eating fast food sometimes and fell into that habit more when I lived on my own. My husband didn't eat that way, and i found the importance of cooking, sitting together, and eating balanced meals, as often as possible.  \n\nYou could start a new routine by cooking on the weekends so you have meal prepped stuff for yourself (and hopefully your kids).

Sooo wtf are you talking about?", "Why doesn't she get meal kits?  Some of them have options that just require you to \"pop it in the oven.\"  SO MUCH HEALTHIER.  Your kids are really being nutritionally neglected here.  I'm a wife and WFH and the meal kits are a godsend.  Plus now my kids also cook with me because it's so easy.

I personally have a spouse that works 60-120 hours a week so I do 99% of all of the things, both physical and emotional for our family.

I love to cook, but definitely not every day as I run a small business that's extremely time consuming. I tend to buy lots of ingredients when I find a good deal and prep several meals at once. Like I love making any kind of tacos, so I'll buy a bunch of chicken, pork, or beef and cut it up and season it with onions, garlic, various herbs, and whatever else I feel like and I freeze it in gallon bags. I tend to make lots of beans and sauces in advance too, so if I'm wanting tacos, I'll just grab it out of the freezer and put it in my Dutch oven for an hour or two if I cook stuff from frozen. There are so many ways to meal prep in advance so you can have a quick and easy meal that's actually tasty and healthy. If she's not willing to help out more with that stuff, maybe it's time for you to cut back at work and do the cooking and she can get a job to cover the difference.", "Like how do the kids and her eat...
