For brunch, tips were pooled and split. That\u2019s the way this place has always done it. The people involved in this are Maria (20 F) and George (21 M). I\u2019ll try to be short and to the point. \n\nMaria, George and I are like a little friend group at work since we all went to the same high school and know a lot of the same people. We joke around and have each others backs more so than some of the others we don\u2019t know as well. That\u2019s why I\u2019m posting here and second guessing this. \n\nMaria\u2019s boyfriends family came in for brunch. She was given a large cash tip from them. They gave her the cash so she could pocket it. Her George and I were all talking in the back when she told us about this and said to keep quiet while assuming we would because of our friendship. \n\nI spoke to George privately and told him that I think Maria is wrong for keeping the tip all to herself and that I find it to be like stealing from the res of us. I told him that I was thinking about confronting Maria about this and if she refuses to hand in the cash than I will tell a manager. \n\nGeorge told me that I would be an asshole. He said it was her boyfriends family so it\u2019s a little different. He also said I\u2019m being naive if I really think nobody else kept any cash tips. He told me that the family wanted the money to go to her explicitly and that is okay because it\u2019s their money. It\u2019s also her boyfriend and lot just some strangers. I still can\u2019t help but feel like The rest of us are being cheated here so I am debating doing what I said above.

Admittedly, I never necessarily worked at restaurants that had tip pools, but I did have to tip out cooks, dishwashers, and prep based on how much I earned that night. They usually understood when this happened because I wasn't necessarily the only one this happened with. For all intents and purposes, I might have waited on him, but that was basically a gift to me rather than actual wages.\n\nHonestly, you just sound greedy and I'm betting you would keep the tip money yourself if your partner's family or your family showed up and gave you a bit more than is typical.", "YTA. You\u2019re being petty, don\u2019t do it. Think of what you would gain by snitching compared to what you would lose, those two wouldn\u2019t be friendly with you anymore and should you need them to cover for you at any point you can bet they won\u2019t.

Assuming she pooled all of the rest of her tips, most definitely YTA - big time.\n\nAlso, as someone who spent years working as a chef, I can tell you that snitching for any reason at all is way against the unspoken rules of working in a restaurant, especially since you're basically accusing her of theft which could not only get her fired but blackballed since the restaurant world is so small and tight-knit. You'd be doing more than just snitching. You'd be ruining her life, potentially for many years to come. So, the fact that you're contemplating snitching at all makes you an even bigger A than any of the other combined factors.\n\nI'm glad I don't work with you, and I'm glad you're not my \"friend\".", "In the case of snitching, YWBTA, and you very well may poison the well at your job with your coworkers.

You\u2019re still going to get a cut of everyone else\u2019s pay at the end of the day, but this tip is more like a personal gift and they intentionally gave her cash so it would be for her alone.

Tip pooling is fine and all, but when the customer leaves an unusually large tip meant for one employee, that should absolutely be an exception to the pooling of tips.

I worked in the industry for years, and yes, she should have pooled it, but when it's family, it gets complicated. She SHOULD have reported at least half to the tip pool, especially since surely bus boys worked on that table, perhaps a bartender made them drinks, etc.  \n\nBut when it's divided up, it's probably worth less than $8 to $10 to you. You might say something to her, but not the boss.", "Many servers keep a cash tip , even when policy is to hand it in to split it. It has been like this for years across hospitality.

It might not seem fair, but this feels more like them giving her a gift than just tipping for a service, so I'd personally try to let it go. I don't think this is worth throwing away a friendship over. You can talk to her about how you felt it was unfair to everyone else who was helping to make sure that table had a good meal and that you wish that she had declared at least part of the tip for their sake, but I don't think you need to bring your boss into it over one instance of keeping a cash tip for herself.", "Lightly YWBTA.

At most, you can speak to her about it directly. \nEven then, you\u2019re not entitled to more than 20% of the bill.

Maybe not with other servers/bartenders but absolutely with the busters/bar backs etc. OP is being an asshole in this situation though", "Why? Because it's the industry standard that servers who are expected to contribute to a tip pool means that a cash tip doesn't mean it's 100% theirs? Contributing to a tip pool is a very standard concept in the restaurant industry. It is how servers, barbacks, expediters, hostesses and now in many cases, back of the house gets tipped so that there's more equitable pay.\n\nI'm a little unclear why I got downvoted for this.\n\nTo be clear, I do NOT think the majority of servers and bartenders underreport and cheat the tip pool. But every once in awhile, there's somebody who routinely skims off the top, and if you're managing multiple servers over time, you can see the pattern. \n\nI had one server who always reported about 40 percent lower tips than anyone else, but then I heard him boasting about great big cash tips he was getting when he was outside smoking with his girlfriend who worked next door. Other servers also brought it up to me quietly. I started to watch his checks more closely, and had two groups of friends come in as undercover diners. He was comping people free drinks if they promised to tip him in cash. One night, I asked him to show me his cash tips for the night during tip out - he'd reported about 2/3 of what he actually had in his pocket. \n\nSo it does happen, although it is not that common or egregious. \n\nIn this case with his friend, it really would have been more equitable if she would have contributed what would have been a standard tip for that table to the tip pool. But I don't think it's worth losing his friend over.  \n\nThere are also restaurants that do not give the servers the totality of the tips provided on credit cards. Legally, that's considered wage theft. State laws vary, and restaurants can sometimes use language on a menu to justify not giving them all out by allocating them toward back a house labor cost, for example. To fight that, I always leave cash tips and assume the servers will tip out of that's their system.", "Facts", "I agree too; didn't quite get where you were coming from <3", "You can't even say \"yes\" in an hypothetical scenario LOL... you know you would pocket it.", "Because you cannot certainly be this brain dead.
