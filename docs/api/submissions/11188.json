I don't have a 28 year old daughter yet but I do have one who's 25, and what tattoos or piercings or whatever she does to her body is absolutely none of my business.\n\nThat said, I'm 52, I have 6 tattoos on various parts of my body that all have very personal meanings to me, and I think her tattoos sound extremely cute, fun and meaningful.", "\"I just think the actual images are going to be regretted.\"\n\nWell guess what? \n\nNOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE.", "I love the \"Untitled Goose Game\" defiantly worth the purchase", "My kid is only 4 but if he ever wanted to get matching tattoos, I'd be with him in a heartbeat for matching murder duckies. \n\nIn my mind, it's the duckling from the Mo Willams books.", "I found it on Switch at my local GameStop over the weekend.", "I have a trans friend with a full HP sleeve. He has... regrets. LOL", "I want to hear the stories behind her tattoo choices.  A bomb with kitty ears sounds adorable. Honestly with a good artist all of these tattoos could be amazing. They are her memories and her body. YTA", "YTA. I have some absolutely silly tattoos, several are ones I got with friends. Some have no explanation other than- it made me laugh. The legs are a great place for whimsy and nonsense.", "I think they are all dumb ideas, so I guess it is a good thing that I am not getting them tattooed onto my body. You're going to have to let this one go.", "YTA! I have a beautiful tattoo on my thigh that I spent over 1k on. What to know which tattoo is my favorite? The video game one that I got as a sibling tattoo for a couple hundred. Stop being judgmental about what your daughter loves! Especially since it's about her siblings!", "YTA.\n\nIt's her body, not yours. You don't have to like them.", "Ya those sound super dumb. NTA", "YTA- the tattoos are super fun and mean something to her. That\u2019s what matters. I have a narwhal holding a dessert pizza and a trex riding a bike with a basket. They all mean something to me and are silly. Who gives a fuck.", "YTA. Most tattoos people get look stupid to me, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna tell them that. It\u2019s their body and their decision; if it makes your daughter happy, who are you to tell her that shes wrong", "YTA. Didn\u2019t even read it. Not your body not your choice. \n\nZip your damn lips.", "YTA for going about it the way you did. Yes, those are horrible tattoo ideas but it is still her body and her memories. It\u2019s be better if you had softly worked up to your concern, expressing things like how such tattoos might be interpreted on the job market, how well they might age, wedding photos, etc. now she isn\u2019t going to trust your opinion for shit. I am completely covered in tatts and some of them are pretty stupid. One of them I got out of spite bc someone told me it *was* stupid when I brought it up as a joke (it\u2019s a butt with a butt tattoo on my butt, \u00e0 la Beavis and Butthead). Be gentle with your concern and she might listen. Be a judgemental jerk and her wedding photos might display a cock and balls tatt with \u2018Dad\u2019 written on it on her back.", "I have a strict opinion about tattoos. If it's not something you've wanted for years you don't need it. No one should walk into the parlour and look through the books. This is forever, be smart. NTA", "To make up for this you need to go with her and get a \u201cReddit said to me YTA\u201d tattoo to commemorate this memory.", "YTA", "YTA Her body, her choice means her body her choice not her body her choice until it doesn't sit right with me because I don't think her choices are valid.", "YTA. \n\nAnd I say that as a 34 year old woman who literally just got the most ridiculous tattoo ever today. It\u2019s her body. Wtf is the point of life if we don\u2019t enjoy the silly stuff?", "I think with any tattoo, you should get the drawing and just sit on it for a month and look at them, imagine them on your body for all time.   If you still love the idea after that, then go for it.", "YTA, I know tons of people with questionable, stupid, asinine tattoos who absolutely love them with zero regrets. I know a dude who told the artist to put whatever she wanted to fill up his sleeve, he ended up with a collection of the most random stuff, including a really cute comic croissant. Guess who loves his rando sleeve? I know some people get really precious and worried about the permanence of tattoos, but most people who get tattoos will tell you they have far fewer regrets than you might expect. I frankly have a lot more regret for not getting half my weird tattoo ideas. Just let your kid express her love and creativity and provide a cheerful compliment after she gets them. If you really wanted to be awesome you could even offer to pay for one as a goodwill gesture, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love that.", "I want to get a Nintendo wii remote or two for my brothers which would be stupid for some but special to me. Of course yta", "yes YTA. they are not your tattoos, and the fact that you think you get to dictate what they are, and whether people should get them is ridiculous. those are memories that she finds near and dear to her heart. if anything, they're almost like inside jokes to her, because no one will know why she got them. don't act like she needs your permission to do anything.", "My buddy Kevin has a tattoo of his best friends face on the body of an ostrich. It\u2019s great.\n\nI don\u2019t know why anyone would give a shit. Silly tattoos are fine, none of this is permanent because we\u2019re all going to the dirt eventually.  Let your daughter experience a little joy and remember her siblings fondly to the end. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You don't get to make those choices for her. Those are HER memories, and they are important to her. You're not \"your body your choice\", you're \"your choice if I don't think it's dumb\". This is a quick way to ruin your relationship with your daughter, and I hope she's more forgiving than I am because I don't play like that.", "Good job dad. It's called running interference and using wisdom gained throughout your life.", "NTA", "NTA. Why have we gotten to the point that it\u2019s considered offensive to give constructive feedback? These do sound awful.", "It doesn\u2019t sit well with you because you think these tattoos will make your adult daughter less attractive to you. And you\u2019re not sure if that makes YTA?", "YTA  \n\"significant to her\" is the key, it doesn't matter what your opinion is.  Our daughter got her first tat last Nov, I'm not a fan of butterflies myself, too 'girly' for me and over used, I have 7 tats myself.  She loves it and I love her.  It doesn't matter what she gets on her body, as a parent you are there to support your child and 'big them up' not drag them down and make them question their own choices.  \nUsing the term \"tacky\" is a little harsh, don't you think? \"Doesn't sit well with you\", again, it's not about YOU.  \n\n\nHope you sort it out as you could end up causing more issues than were ever needed.", "The tattoos with a story are 100% always the coolest tattoos", ">I told her she could at least pick better memories\n\nSounds like he's angling for a big I LOVE DAD tattoo in a giant heart.\n\nmaybe she can get a tattoo of nothing in honour of the memory of this nasty conversation.", "She's 28 and already has multiple tattoos. I think she's already aware of what impact this will have on her earning potential (FYI, it probably won't impact it at all because it's 2023 and the vast majority of employers don't care).", "You\u2019re overlooking the halo sword.

I would love to hear the stories behind all the tattoos she chose.", "YTA", "YTA. Neither of my tattoos have *any* kind of personal or sentimental meaning to me. I simply liked the idea of them for a long enough period of time I decided to get them put on me. The idea that tattoos need to be meaningful is outdated.

How f*cking cool is that?", "Yeah, YTA\n\nThe memories are significant to her and she likes them honestly a duckling with a knife seems pretty cool lol", "YTA!

She is in 100% control of what she wants on her body", "Honestllyyy as someone with many tattoos I\u2019m gonna say NTA on this one. While I don\u2019t see it being very fair to deny her the chance of getting these tattoos after questioning her decision (if she still wants to get them then let it go) but I actually think you\u2019re doing her a favour by posing doubt because those tattoo ideas are conceptually awful and it would be very hard to make them look visually pleasing which I think most people desire in their own body art. At the end of the day it\u2019s up to her though so don\u2019t push it, but if one of my friends told me they were going to get a container of fish food tattooed I would definitely say they should reconsider that.", "ooooo, yeeesssss....
