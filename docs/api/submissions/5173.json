Your family is TOXIC and they are gaslighting you because they STOLE YOUR MONEY.\n\nYou're still in high school so I assume you live rent free at home and feel stuck. Is there family or a close friend that you could stay with? I'd start looking at job options and do everything in your power to get out. \n\nAnd you're 18, so you could pursue getting that money back from them if you wanted to. If you absolutely must live at home for now though, sadly that would be far more hassle than it's worth.", "NTA Your parents are thieves and a lack of planning on their behalf doesn't constitute as an emergency for you. There's no reason for them to steal your money for your brother. Christmas is the same time each year so they can't say that it was unexpected. Your parents work issues aren't and shouldn't be your problem they chose to be parents now they need to accept both the good and the bad and they are financially responsible for your brothers wants and needs along with you and your siblings, it's not your financial responsibility to support them/\n\nThey also need to remember that they have another 3 kids and as for the extended family as them how they'd feel if your parents stole money from them to buy your brother some matchbox cars? Then tell them to hand over to your parents the exact same amount right now and that they can't whinge about it at all, if they do try to complain and say hat they don't need to hand over any money tell them that your parents can steal it from them and after all they've chosen to refer to you as the grinch so now they should either put up or shut up.", "NTA. Theft is theft. And they didn\u2019t even use what they stole to get essentials like food or medication. I\u2019m sorry that your family is taking advantage of you.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry, honey. That\u2019s their responsibility, not yours. They should\u2019ve asked you first if you would\u2019ve liked to get your brother something and not just taken your money. Big hugs.", "NTA - They\u2019re gaslighting you, it\u2019s your money that you diligently saved. Sometimes family can be crueler than strangers on the street. The only silver lining is they have shown their true colours over a small amount of money, moving forward I suggest you don\u2019t trust them to have your best interests in mind whenever they do anything. \n\nBest of luck OP, you deserve better.", "NTA\n\nThat is theft and using your brother against you. Also, you must live in farm country or somewhere else with cows abound because I can smell BS about them spending it all on toy cars for him (mostly because $91 would be a ridiculous number of hot wheels?)\n\nI'm spiteful enough to say cut ties and find a new place to live so you can go NC with your parents, but that's just me.", "NTA. Question- have you ever considered moving out?", "NTA. That money was supposed to be for basic nessecities. Even though everyone want to have a good christmas, Theft is not the way to go. That was your hard earned money and they had no right what so ever to spend that without your consent.", "Don\u2019t even gotta read the story NTA. I have 5 siblings 3 of them younger than me 1 has autism and another has type one diabetes. Don\u2019t steal from family members especially when they\u2019ll need that money later on in a already hard life", "NTA. Your family had no right to take the money you saved and spend it. Keep your money in a wallet that\u2019s with you at all times or just find a better hiding spot so this doesn\u2019t happen again", "NTA. That was your money you worked to save. It was not their property. And as the parents, it is up to them to purchase things for their children to let them \"have a good Christmas\" when possible. Stealing from other of their children to do it is wrong on so many levels.", "NTA at all! Your parents shouldn\u2019t have touched that money. Your brother\u2019s Christmas isn\u2019t your responsibility, it\u2019s theirs. This sounds like a super toxic (and all too familiar) household.", "NTA you deserve better", "This is a case where I don\u2019t think this belongs in AITA, but maybe a therapy forum as this is where there are multiple disabilities, no idea about SSI/SSDI is established, SNAP and if previous boundaries were established about money or rooms etc. \n\nThis sounds like a family dysfunction thing and there\u2019s just not enough info to do this justice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To begin, Im a 18 male, I am in high school, I live in Minnesota. And I have 4 siblings, one of which is disabled. My family is very disabled, My mom doesn't work, my dad barely works, and they mainly live off my brother social security. We sometimes barely have enough to eat.\n\nMy little brother, who is severely disabled is 17 and has the mental capacity of a 3-6 year old. He loves cars, hot wheels, the movie, anything. I love my brother, and He's amazing. He still believes in Santa Clause. But let me get to the story.\n\nFor the past year, I've been scrounging up a quarter every day for exactly 365 days, I am into those YouTube savings challenges, And I had saved exactly 91$, You see, I also am autistic, but I am high functioning and I have some sort of OCD, So everyday for a year, I would find a quarter and save it. I was going to use this to help my best friend get some well needed clothes. (He's also poor) Well after rolling my quarters and taking them to the store and exchanging them I take the money home and put it in my room. \n\nLo and behold, a day later the money is missing. Of course I go to my parents and ask about it, they would then later tell me that they used the money to buy my brother a bunch of hot wheel cars. I began arguing with them that they had no right. The money wasn't for them. They would then call me entitled, selfish, and evil because I didnt want my disabled brother to have a good Christmas. \n\nThat's entirely not true but now the whole family is pissed at me, but ive been crying, I worked so hard this year to save that money, just for all of it to go poof. I know it was going to get spent on someone else anyway but at least I would've had a say. Everyones telling me im a grinch, that my brother deserves better and Im beginning to feel guilty. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. Tell them they have 24 hours to return the cars and get your money back or you will call the police. \n\nTheft is theft and not even family gets a pass on that.", "NTA.  Your parents had no right to take your money.  They are the ones who are entitled, selfish and evil - not you!  Your friend needed clothes more than your brother needed hot-wheels.", "NTA. Your parents STOLE from you, and I doubt they spent it all on hot wheels. But even if they did, you are not responsible for providing money for your parents to spend on your brother.", "First and foremost you are NTA, not the asshole in anyway at all. Your dysfunctional toxic parents are gaslighting you by trying to blame you for being upset they literally stole money you saved over a year to avoid accepting any responsibility for their actions. This situation has nothing to do with your brother and everything to do with parents that sound like they should not be parents. My advice, when school is back in session go to your guidance counselor and ask for their help in getting you out of your parents home due to their behavior. If your parents were truly disabled they would also be receiving social security, it's not like they don't know about the program. You are going to have to do some very adult things in quick order to protect yourself from your parents. Like finding a job after school, and planning a future where you have limited contact with them. Also from now on put any money you receive into a bank account that they have no access to, they will steal from you again if they can.", "I rely on my parents but I have always been considered the second option in regards to my brother. I am trying to find a friend to stay with but no luck", "Thank you, Im just so upset, because everyday, I mean everyday, I somehow scrounged up 25 cents. If it wasn't doing odd jobs for neighbors, cleaning out my families cars looking for change etc. It's all gone and I'm so disappointed", "They\u2019re treating OP\u2019s brother like a cash cow, he\u2019s the closest they have to a stable income.", "I am trying to find a friend to stay with, My parents recently received social security for me too until I turned 18 so I wasn't allowed to get a job so I barely have any experience.", "I am just feeling really guilty", "Are you planning to go to university? If so, there may be not just federal/state funding but scholarships to help with living costs. Some scholarships cater to people with specific qualifications, such as autism. Try speaking to someone at your school to see if they can help you navigate your options.\n\nAlso, find a safe place to store your personal documents (social security, birth certificate, etc). And get a bank account with ONLY your name on it.", "When you can get out, cut ties. Your parents will have you eyed up as a potential career for your brother because he\u2019s your brother and family and all that. They already consider your money their money to go on your brother.", "Your feelings a very much valid for the circumstances. I highly recommend channeling that emotion into motivation to get a job. Write a resume and just start handing out to any place that will take it. Never think \u201cI have no experience\u201d, nobody starts off with experience. You have the persistence to scrounge around for every coin, I have no doubt you can use that same persistence to keep applying for jobs and eventually succeed. You\u2019ll get knocked down a million times in your life, what truely matters is if you can get back up and keep moving forward.", "If you were recieving support prior to 18 you might want to look into continuing this and using that to move out from their home. \n\nYou sound like an amazing brother and a really resourceful and intelligent young man, it's never too late to gain experience. \n\nYou're clearly NTA here and I hope you're able to restart your savings and put it toward something for yourself \ud83d\udc95", "To be honest, I would also feel a tinge of guilt. But that was your hard earned money that you were saving for a YEAR. I don't know the reason that your parents are not working, but if they want to use their son's hard earned money, they should earn it for themselves instead. And besides, they should be mature enough to know what is wrong and what is right, and this was a horrible thing to do on their part.", "They stole from you, *they* should be the ones feeling guilty. The money is yours, and they knew what they did was wrong or else they would've just asked you for it. Instead they snuck in and took it, and didn't tell you until you asked. They know they're being shady af, and they're trying to make you feel guilty so you don't realize how badly they're treating you. \n\nAlso, you had plans to help someone with that money - you were saving up to get your friend some *clothes*, for crying out loud. Even if you'd been saving it up for something ridiculous it would *still* be your right, but this just makes it worse. Why are your brother's toys more important than your friend having something that's necessary? (Honestly, what you were trying to do for your friend is really important, and I'm sorry that they've stolen that from you and your friend.) \n\nYou sound like someone with a lot of compassion and goodness. Unfortunately, it sounds like your family is trying to manipulate you and take advantage of your compassion and goodness. You may not have any choice but to let them do it right now, but keep reminding yourself that *this is not right,* and do your best to take measures to prevent them from being able to take advantage of you in the future.", "I have already applied for the FASFA and I am going to attend a nearby UNI, But Ill ask them about scholorships for people with Austism, thank you <3", "Put a spin on skills you already have, and how they can be applied to a potential workplace. Instead of worrying about experience you don\u2019t have, think about how you can demonstrate skills workplaces will want.", "Sorry, to be clear I didn't mean to just look for scholarships for people with autism. But was just trying to point out that some scholarships are specific and will have a unique qualification like that. Be sure to look at ANY possible scholarships because most people don't even bother with scholarships and you would be amazed how often people that put in the effort can end up with a bunch of money that can be used to help cover their needs not being met by grants, especially living costs and food plans.\n\nBasically, talk to ANYONE at your school that can help you and do your research to find help online as well. \n\nBest of luck to you, I hope you can get out soon.", "I second this!!"]}
