She\u2019s always been very vague about what she does for a living (sati things like writing and working from home writing) but recently, one of her friends mentioned something and I finally dragged it out of her. She\u2019s an author, she write and self published romance and erotica stories and novels and while not rich, she\u2019s able to make a living out of it.\n\nI googled her name and couldn\u2019t find anything so I confronted her about this.\n\nShe said she\u2019s writing under a pen name so I demanded she gives it to me so I know what she does.\n\nShe refuses saying she doesn\u2019t want it to be leaked even by accident and no one knows.\n\nI accused her of not trusting me and she still refused which was really annoying.\n\nI tried nicer approach and told her that I want to know her fantasies so I can try it out with her and she told me that what she writes aren\u2019t her fantasies but her readers and she\u2019s still not going to tell me.\n\nAt night I tried to check her laptop for her pen name but she changed her password before bed. I was annoyed and told her she clearly doesn\u2019t trust me and it\u2019s not fair because I have a right to know what she writes especially since it\u2019s a sensitive topic and I don\u2019t know her if I don\u2019t know her pen name.\n\nShe was furious I tried to look on her laptop and told me to go home. Before leaving I told her when she calls to apologize, I expect to get her pen name with the apology.\nShe called me an asshole on my way out.\n\nI thought she\u2019d call by now but she hasn\u2019t. My sister told me I was the asshole and I should apologize but I just don\u2019t see it and need. Second opinion.

I wish I could've seen your face when you realized she changed her password. You don't have a right to know,  so I would suggest accepting that.", "YTA, and I hope she doesn't ever call you again.  She has very good reasons to not trust you.  You were manipulative when you tried to lie about wanting to try out her fantasies.  You then tried to violate her privacy by looking in her laptop.

You think she's going to be sorry that you left.\n\nShe's probably grateful, not sorry.", "YTA , I don\u2019t know how you wrote this entire post and didn\u2019t realize it. \n\nYou started by demanding, not asking, for her pen name.\n\nYou\u2019ve only been dating for six months and she told you she isn\u2019t comfortable sharing yet- and instead of understanding and giving her time you reacted angrily. \n\nThen you tried a manipulative approach- feigning interest in her fantasies to get it out of her. This is doubly bad since you assumed without asking that what she does professionally is a personal kink for her??? \n\nShe said no again, so you ignored her boundaries and went behind her back to try and find out yourself. This is also a breach of privacy. \n\nYou assumed you had a right to know something she wasn\u2019t ready to share even after you proved yourself untrustworthy. \n\nAnd to top it all off, you left saying you expected an apology like you\u2019re some kind of victim when she did nothing wrong.", "Yta - you come across as someone who would threaten to rage-leak her name every time she displeased you", "YTA.

Then you tried to access her personal laptop for the information, which makes you an asshole and a snoop and burglar-adjacent. AND THEN while she was throwing you out you said she better have an apology when you hear from her next, which are the last words of countless assholes throughout history when thrown out on their asses.

She has a very logical reasoning to why she doesn\u2019t want you to know - even though a simple \u201cno\u201d should have sufficed - and that is she just doesn\u2019t want erotica and romance tied to her real name. \n\nSo, instead of accepting no, you continue to pester her and accuse her of not trusting you. Then you lie about wanting to know her fantasies (the \u201cnicer\u201d approach) and still get annoyed when she says no, DESPITE HER ALREADY GIVING YOU HER REASONING.\n\nAnd then (shocked face emoji) you attempt to go through her laptop at night??

After you snooped through her things and demanded to know private information (its a pen name for a reason)? What would she even apologise for? \n\nYou don\u2019t \u201chave a right\u201d to know.

Either way be prepared to be single again.", "YTA, Jesus, dude controlling much? You don't need to know what's she's writing.

You don't get to *go snooping through her personal devices against her explicitly stated wishes*. Jesus Christ.", "\"She does not trust me with this important information!  So I will go to the INTERNET!\"\n\nWho needs drugs when we have this level of unironic surrealism.", "I mean, I think he's single now.", "OP very much seems like the sort that would dox her if they ever got in a fight, and also like he just wants to read what she writes so he can make sure he \"approves\" of it and if she wrote anything he didnt like he would harass her over it until she promised to stop writing. His ex is probably realizing she dodged a huge bullet.", "Exactly. He has demonstrated exactly why he is not to be trusted.\nOP, YTA", "100% this. His entitled attitude alone shows he would definitely hold it over her head if he ever found out. Not a good person. OP, YTA.", ">I thought she\u2019d call by now but she hasn\u2019t.\n\nI think it's adorable he calls her his \"girlfriend\" - IMO she's *clearly* an ex at this point.", "\"a lying liar\". that made me laugh.", "It sounds like she's a strong woman and has no interest in putting up with his creepy, manipulative, overbearing crap. OP is definitely TA.", "Sounds like she did", "Which is probably the main reason she won\u2019t tell him the name. YTA", "and when that didnt work, good ol going behind her back and violating her privacy. oh yeah, op sure is learning what her fantasies are: *not* having abusive boyfriends", "Sounds like she already did, I\u2019d never call or talk to him again lmao", "YES to all of this.  And I'd like to add that you're also TA for 'demanding' she tell you.  It's not your right to have that information, however, she has a right to her privacy regardless of your relationship status.", ">There's no way you're in your 30s and this immature\n\nYeah, this was another post where I had to scroll back and check the age again.", "She is so right to have a secret pen name!   This person sounds like someone who would hold it over her whenever they were angry.", "Pet snakes deserve better than being named after OP. Your first thought is much better.", "That was my favorite part. He tries snooping on her laptop and, same paragraph, complains she doesn't trust him. Hard to trust someone who exhibits inherently untrustworthy actions. No way this relationship is continuing.\n\nOP, YTA - you have 0 respect for your ex-girlfriend.", "also, OP, there\u2019s this thing called conversation. it\u2019s where you use your vocal cords and ASK someone questions. for example: hey, what are your fantasies? or hey, what would you like to do in bed?\n\ngoing behind her back isn\u2019t the way to do it and for someone who is over 30, you should know that by now. \n\nYTA.", "Surely no one can this blatant of an asshole and not see it.", "She knew enough to change her laptop password, she seems smart and on top of it.  If he has a key and she doesn't want him back, those locks are already (hopefully) changed.", "i thought girls *liked it* when men sneak behind their backs after being told repeatedly NO. \n\nwomen! so hard to please!", "I mean, did you also miss this?\n\n> At night I tried to check her laptop for her pen name but she changed her password before bed.\n\nOP is absolutely unhinged, imagine writing that sentence and thinking you have any chance of being voted not the asshole", "Oh, totally.  That was for op to reflect on, lol. At least he's great character inspiration for her next work!", "oh no, he is *definitely* the type to dox her. within a small time frame, he accused her of being untrustworthy, \"demanded\" she do what he wants, tries to manipulate her, tries to *break into her laptop* and gets upset cause she changed the password.\n\nop isnt just a bad bf, he was set out to destroy her", "Yep, on all counts.  OP did her a favor by storming off.\n\nThis is giving me some schadenfreude:\n>I thought she\u2019d call by now but she hasn\u2019t.", "OPs expecting an apology and doesn't even realize he's been ghosted", "\u201cI tried breaking into her laptop but OMG SHE DOESN\u2019T TRUST ME WHHHHYYYYYY????\u201d", "May she milk him for minor villains for years.
