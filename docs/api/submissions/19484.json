After she left, one of our friends (F24) invited me (M24) to go on a hike with her.\n\nWe both enjoy long walks and thought it would be a great opportunity to catch up, as we had't the opportunity to chat in weeks, also the weather was going to be great. We met in the late afternoon at a trail in our area and hiked for a few hours and had lots of fun. Problems started when we both stumbled into a prickly bush. With Lyme disease and ticks being a growing problem in our area, we were a little worried about that and decided to call off our hike there.\n\nWe went to F24's apartment to help each other get cleaned since most of the thorns were on our backs and legs and we needed to check each other thoroughly for ticks. Thankfully, we didn't find any ticks. We then chilled and watched a movie and ordered some food. Overall, I'd say we had a great time.\n\nI went back to my apartment the next morning to catch up on some work, and my girlfriend called me later in the morning. We talked about her trip, and when I told her about the hike the previous day, she became upset and said that I should not have gone without her knowledge. I told her that she was overreacting, and she only got more upset and said she had to go before hanging up. I've tried calling her back once, but she did not answer. AITA?\n\nEdit - For those wondering, me and F24 had a short fling (about a month) around 2 years ago. We were friends before that, and have continued to be friends after that.\n\nWe slept on two **separate** beds that were close together\n\nUPDATE - I finally got hold of my GF and we talked for awhile, I did calm her down and she is much less upset now. I reassured her to enjoy her trip as she'll still be out of town for 2 more days.\n\nF24 has also texted me letting me know that she's going to the gym and asked if I wanted to join her. I did agree and will keep my GF in the loop throughout.\n\nUPDATE 2 - I did end up going to the gym with F24 and we had an okay time. I let my GF know about it and she was largely fine.\n\nI say we had an \"okay time\" because we met one of our friends (M21) at the gym. He's one of my friends that my GF has said is cute (on more than one occasion).\n\nWhen he saw us together at the gym, he straight up asked me if us going to the gym together meant he could make a move on my GF. WTF?\n\nUPDATE 3 - I've called my GF and we had a long conversation about what's been happening. We have both decided that it is best to end our relationship", "created_utc": 1686408813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14629x3/aita_for_going_hiking_with_my_friend_while_my_gf/", "score": 207, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is that something you do often and your girlfriend is accustomed to?\n\nYou and your girlfriend need to navigate what each of you is comfortable with, and what each of you feels strongly enough about that you would do it even if the other wasn't comfortable with.
