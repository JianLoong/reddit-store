Older siblings often have more rules than what is enforced with younger siblings as parents relax or are just tired.  I had a similar experience though My Muslim parents weren\u2019t super strict. My older sister didn\u2019t even ask to go to prom since school dances were off limits, wore pants or skirts to the ankle and she was in Sunday school until she aged out. In contrast, they let me go to prom because my sister told them she regretted not getting to go, I pushed the boundaries of clothes until I had midi length skirts and since they were sick of giving up every Sunday to take me to Sunday school when I was so loud/moody about having to wake up early to go, they stopped bothering with it.  I got a lot of privileges much earlier because they either calmed down about the risk factors or I was willing to push for privileges that my sister didn\u2019t and I wore them down. It happens.

That said, I\u2019d use your relative age for good - help get your sister reasonable opportunities to have fun and explore life. My sister did it for me - she talked my parents into letting me do a lot of things that they knee jerk said no to.

Not with the goal of her no to go, I never said that to them, but for them to aknowledge it and, maybe, appolozige.\n\nYour sisters dont have fault for what happened to you. You were a classic older child, who behaved herself and followed the rules. She is the classic younger, who draw a plan to which your parents wouldnt say no: she will be shapperon by a male cousin, not by friends.

This is a missed opportunity for a memory you can always cherish and it's excruciating painful to know that you didn't have the opportunity because your parents didn't care about you enough.\nAnd sure, security is a somewhat valid concern, but oftentimes it's just parents being too lazy, ignorant and dismissive", "*Should* let it go is a very painful thing to say in this situation imo\n\nIt isn't the sister's fault their parents did that to OP but you also can't just tell OP to let it go because it definitely hurts. Why does OP need to be the bigger person and heal herself when it is way past when those life-changing memories could be made? But her sister gets to do them with so much support?\n\nIt is the parents' fault really and for no good reason considering they can let the younger do as she pleases with much support. I personally would cut ties with them as soon as I am able because I don't believe ruining someone's best years like that and then going back on such actions towards others is fair in the slightest.

Additionally, it doesn\u2019t sound like OP ever pushed back. She just went along with the rules while her sister challenged it. That\u2019s how I got away with more. I didn\u2019t just accept that it would \u201clook bad\u201d if I went to the City with my friends. I demanded to know what was bad about it and in what way was it immoral/un-Islamic.

Oop\u2019s sister came with a power point  and a chaperone, she was either told no first then came with the power point or learned from the past that she need to have ways to resolve their issues first. I don\u2019t think this is a case of a simple being less strict as they get older. That may have came into play her but I think the sister coming in with a power point,assumingly addressing all the No reasons with solutions, was a big factor in the change of heart", "Children are not carbon copies of each other and you have to parent the child not a litter if siblings.  \n\nOP YTA  complaining about things 10 years ago shows an immaturity level that may explain the difference in parenting choices", "It's got nothing to do with strictness, it's got to do with circumstances.   \n\nI think Op parents didn't trust the people Op would be going with or they were afraid for Op's safety.\n\nThe younger sister is going with someone they do trust and they feel safer.", "I understand why she feels that way.

This is either parents realizing their mistake and are softening, which is once again BS, or they're favoring their youngest. I stand by what I said, nta and it's BS. In situations like this you can't have exceptions as I've said and at one point they denied op when they were a legal adult, just reiterating", "The parents probably agreed because of the chaperone.\nIn the end OP can be angry with her parents nonetheless. Those parents are dismissive of her feelings, they denied her an opportunity for a memory she would have always cherished.\nIt's good that parents don't make the same mistake with their other children, but they should admit that not letting OP go to the concert was a questionable choice"]}
