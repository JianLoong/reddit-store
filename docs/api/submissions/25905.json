Older siblings often have more rules than what is enforced with younger siblings as parents relax or are just tired.  I had a similar experience though My Muslim parents weren\u2019t super strict. My older sister didn\u2019t even ask to go to prom since school dances were off limits, wore pants or skirts to the ankle and she was in Sunday school until she aged out. In contrast, they let me go to prom because my sister told them she regretted not getting to go, I pushed the boundaries of clothes until I had midi length skirts and since they were sick of giving up every Sunday to take me to Sunday school when I was so loud/moody about having to wake up early to go, they stopped bothering with it.

In situations like this you can't have exceptions as I've said and at one point they denied op when they were a legal adult, just reiterating", "The parents probably agreed because of the chaperone.\nIn the end OP can be angry with her parents nonetheless. Those parents are dismissive of her feelings, they denied her an opportunity for a memory she would have always cherished.\nIt's good that parents don't make the same mistake with their other children, but they should admit that not letting OP go to the concert was a questionable choice", "Your feelings are valid and as a woman with a 10 year younger little sister myself, I totally get where you're coming from. It's like my sister and I had totally different sets of parents. She was allowed to do a TON of stuff that I wasn't allowed to do at similar ages. They tolerated a lot of her quirks and idiosyncrasies whereas they used to berate me for mine. They were so kind and understanding whenever she messed up whereas they expected the highest possible standards from me and expressed their disappointment constantly if I didn't live up to those. I used to have a lot of pent up anger well into my early 30s about this.\n\n Ironically it was with my little sister's help that I managed to work through this anger because once she became an adult she started seeing these double standards and would call my parents out and then my parents would accept and apologise. At the early stages of this, this also hurt and angered me because whenever I tried to explain to them how the double standards hurt me, it would ALWAYS end up in a fight because my parents would say the same things your mom is saying and just get defensive. Then when my sister would bring it up, they'd be very docile and listen. So I was like wtf!! Gradually for my own sanity and peace of mind I learned to let it go. They do have a lot of good qualities apart from this so I looked on the positive side plus I realised that since there is such a large age gap between me and my sister, we effectively *did* pretty much have \"different\" parents. Because parents are also human beings who live and grow. They were 27 and 29 when they had me and very unsettled in their lives and careers. When they had her, they were 37 and 39 and were well established in their careers and lives. They also had matured quite a bit as people and had learned to relx and not be so uptight. \n\nTry to work through this in a way that brings you peace \u2764\ufe0f", "Hey ! I had to face the exact same things a couple years ago. I was not mad at my siblings for going to those events, but at my parents, because they evolved into allowing this, but not evolved enough to admit that they could have let me do those things..\n\nI tried several times to talk to them about it, in vain.\n\nWhat I felt also, was a feeling of wasting my childhood because I didn't do that, or this. I felt that I missed out in life, compared to others.\n\nWhat I do now :- everytime some things like that happen, I keep telling myself 'you're in a better place now, let it go'.\n\n\\- I made a list of everything I wanted to do when I was a child and I wasn't allow to, and I try to do all of them, at my own place, in my control, with whoever I want.\n\n\\- I try to think about everything we did do, as a family, and try to remember the good memories.\n\n\\- I did stop sharing some stuff with my parents about what I do. It's more about protecting those memories.. For example, when I was little, we never went to the beach, and I never get to do a sandcastel, even at the parks..  I did it for the first time, at 32, in July. I told my parents about it and they asked me 'are you a child ?'. DUUUUH, you didn't let me be one. It kinda ruined my memory of it. So now, I just enjoy the things and that's the process of healing my inner child.\n\n\\- What I did also, is to write a letter where I accept the apologies of people who was faulty towards me. That sounds so childish, but it helped me to stop expecting apologies or admission of erros from people. You may think 'ooh letting me not go to a concert is not that bad.., it's not really worth an apology'. Well.. I think it does.\n\nAlso, everyone saying 'you're 26 now, get over it, you can do what ever you want'.No, it's not that simple. In many cultures, you're not seen as an adult even if you have a job, even if you're married, even if you are a mother/father.. . The parents keep telling you what to do, they expect you to do things a certain way and they guilt you for doing something they don't approuve of. You can't just tell them 'it's my life, I do what I want', that doesn't work.\n\nAnyway, I hope you're going to grow out of it and that you're going to go to a concert and enjoy it like you would have at 16.

But, now as a parent, parents do change over the years their perspectives on things. Also, a lot of how parents respond to requests depends on context. And there were many things I was not allowed to do with non-Muslim friends that I was allowed to do with family (or Muslim friends). Also, because I had very good grades, I was allowed to do some things my siblings weren\u2019t allowed to do. And your parents might recognize in hindsight they were a little too restrictive with you. \n\nNTA, but they are not necessarily hypocrites.", "you are jealous and rude. And you have every right to be :v /s\n\nYour parents are the AH for not being sorry.And it sounds that your sister had to work (make a presentation, prepare arguments,..) to get that right herself", "YTA. Look, it\u2019s okay to be sad and upset that someone else is allowed something you weren\u2019t allowed. It\u2019s okay to be unhappy with your parents for being controlling with their eldest and more permissive with their youngest. It is unfair to you that you weren\u2019t allowed to go - but not because someone else is allowed.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been fair to stop you having normal teenage experiences and doing safe and ordinary things even if you were an only child.\n\nIt would be unfair to her to not let her go even if *she* was an only child. Why should she miss out on happy experiences just because *you* were treated unfairly? Why do you hold that much spite and bitterness toward her that you want this ruined for her too?\n\nYou *are* being jealous and rude, as well as judgemental and spiteful. She isn\u2019t \u201crebelling\u201d, she advocated for herself. SHE is doing nothing wrong. Your parents did something wrong to you. Why are you acting as if obeying them without question was virtuous or positive and she\u2019s wrong for\u2026 persuading them to change their mind, without disobeying them at all?\n\nYour parents are in the wrong for their ignorant approach to parenting and for refusing to acknowledge they made the wrong decisions about you. YOU are in the wrong for not advocating for yourself at the time and then being spiteful when someone else does advocate for themself, and YTA for trying to ruin things for a child because of your spite about it. The only person who is entirely blameless here is the kid you\u2019re reserving most of your venom for for no reason.", "NAH, except maybe your parents for diminishing your feelings. \n\n\nYour 5 are valid. You have every right to be upset that you missed out on things because of your parents beliefs and fears.\n\n\nBUT. You can make sure your siater has better teen experiences than you did. And that's a wonderful thing. Don't resent her for your feelings towards tour parents.", "NAH, but I wouldn\u2019t try to change their mind or stop her from going. Let her enjoy her freedom that you didn\u2019t get, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this though.\n\nMy cousin wasn\u2019t allowed to go away to college, but their younger sister was a few years later. The parents learned from their mistake with the eldest, and how it meant my cousin had to go to a crappy local one instead of the great one 2 hours away. My cousin is understandably bitter about it, it will and has effected their career prospects etc and they will never get to redo and go back. The sister went to a fab college and lived away, has a great job and so much freedom. \n\nYour feelings are valid, but it\u2019s something you have to work through. Just because you couldn\u2019t do things, and my cousin didn\u2019t get to study at their dream college, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019d want the same for the siblings.

Also, she has a chaperone, an older than her man from the family (that your parents trust on) with her. Circumstances are different. Feels bad is valid but do a tantrum even when you know all is different in her situation is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nSeeing how Muslims marry cousins, she should be stricter with her as they might be secretly dating. (Don't come after me with pitchforks reddit, it's a culture thing)\n\nYour mom clearly has a favourite and will argue to the ends of the earth with you to mask her favoritism. You are no way rude or jealous, you are hurt and rightfully so.", "Agree \ud83c\udfc5", "Yeah, my youngest sister had absolutely no rules while we others had so many. \n\nMy parents were so strict that I wasn't allowed to visit friends because they had male relatives (father/brother). I wasn't allowed to play with boys not even with my cousins while my sister could visit whoever she wanted and play with anyone. \n\nMy mother didn't even know where she was at times, while I was barely allowed to go out of the house to play. I also wasn't allowed to go to the cinema, not even as a teenager while my sister was allowed as soon as she wanted to and so much more.\n\nI did mention to my parents how strict they were before but I was also happy that they changed.

But her mother is also the AH for what she said to her. \n\nMy mother would always say \"we didn't know better\", sometimes apologetic, other times lighthearted but it helps you feel seen by your parents.", "I get ya, I rushed a bit and didn't bother expanding on my thoughts here and honestly don't have the brain power to now either, but you are right that her mother needs to accept she was unfair.", "It doesn't change the fact that they were unfair to her. So basically the obedient child gets punished for being obedient and the parent can't even acknowledge that? That is what OP wants, for them to acknowledge they were unfair. I don't think is too much to ask.", "It\u2019s not fair but you know\u2026 life."]}
