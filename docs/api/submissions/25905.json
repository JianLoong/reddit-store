Older siblings often have more rules than what is enforced with younger siblings as parents relax or are just tired.  I had a similar experience though My Muslim parents weren\u2019t super strict. My older sister didn\u2019t even ask to go to prom since school dances were off limits, wore pants or skirts to the ankle and she was in Sunday school until she aged out. In contrast, they let me go to prom because my sister told them she regretted not getting to go, I pushed the boundaries of clothes until I had midi length skirts and since they were sick of giving up every Sunday to take me to Sunday school when I was so loud/moody about having to wake up early to go, they stopped bothering with it.

In situations like this you can't have exceptions as I've said and at one point they denied op when they were a legal adult, just reiterating", "The parents probably agreed because of the chaperone.\nIn the end OP can be angry with her parents nonetheless. Those parents are dismissive of her feelings, they denied her an opportunity for a memory she would have always cherished.\nIt's good that parents don't make the same mistake with their other children, but they should admit that not letting OP go to the concert was a questionable choice", "Your feelings are valid and as a woman with a 10 year younger little sister myself, I totally get where you're coming from. It's like my sister and I had totally different sets of parents. She was allowed to do a TON of stuff that I wasn't allowed to do at similar ages. They tolerated a lot of her quirks and idiosyncrasies whereas they used to berate me for mine. They were so kind and understanding whenever she messed up whereas they expected the highest possible standards from me and expressed their disappointment constantly if I didn't live up to those. I used to have a lot of pent up anger well into my early 30s about this.\n\n Ironically it was with my little sister's help that I managed to work through this anger because once she became an adult she started seeing these double standards and would call my parents out and then my parents would accept and apologise. At the early stages of this, this also hurt and angered me because whenever I tried to explain to them how the double standards hurt me, it would ALWAYS end up in a fight because my parents would say the same things your mom is saying and just get defensive. Then when my sister would bring it up, they'd be very docile and listen. So I was like wtf!! Gradually for my own sanity and peace of mind I learned to let it go. They do have a lot of good qualities apart from this so I looked on the positive side plus I realised that since there is such a large age gap between me and my sister, we effectively *did* pretty much have \"different\" parents. Because parents are also human beings who live and grow. They were 27 and 29 when they had me and very unsettled in their lives and careers. When they had her, they were 37 and 39 and were well established in their careers and lives. They also had matured quite a bit as people and had learned to relx and not be so uptight. \n\nTry to work through this in a way that brings you peace \u2764\ufe0f", "Hey ! I had to face the exact same things a couple years ago. I was not mad at my siblings for going to those events, but at my parents, because they evolved into allowing this, but not evolved enough to admit that they could have let me do those things..\n\nI tried several times to talk to them about it, in vain.\n\nWhat I felt also, was a feeling of wasting my childhood because I didn't do that, or this. I felt that I missed out in life, compared to others.\n\nWhat I do now :- everytime some things like that happen, I keep telling myself 'you're in a better place now, let it go'.\n\n\\- I made a list of everything I wanted to do when I was a child and I wasn't allow to, and I try to do all of them, at my own place, in my control, with whoever I want.\n\n\\- I try to think about everything we did do, as a family, and try to remember the good memories.\n\n\\- I did stop sharing some stuff with my parents about what I do. It's more about protecting those memories.. For example, when I was little, we never went to the beach, and I never get to do a sandcastel, even at the parks..  I did it for the first time, at 32, in July. I told my parents about it and they asked me 'are you a child ?'. DUUUUH, you didn't let me be one. It kinda ruined my memory of it. So now, I just enjoy the things and that's the process of healing my inner child.\n\n\\- What I did also, is to write a letter where I accept the apologies of people who was faulty towards me. That sounds so childish, but it helped me to stop expecting apologies or admission of erros from people. You may think 'ooh letting me not go to a concert is not that bad.., it's not really worth an apology'. Well.. I think it does.\n\nAlso, everyone saying 'you're 26 now, get over it, you can do what ever you want'.No, it's not that simple. In many cultures, you're not seen as an adult even if you have a job, even if you're married, even if you are a mother/father.. . The parents keep telling you what to do, they expect you to do things a certain way and they guilt you for doing something they don't approuve of. You can't just tell them 'it's my life, I do what I want', that doesn't work.\n\nAnyway, I hope you're going to grow out of it and that you're going to go to a concert and enjoy it like you would have at 16.
