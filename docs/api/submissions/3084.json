You, husband, and son enjoy yourselves and don't give your parents a second thought.

You owe these people nothing, that includes tact.\n\nI am going to say this with no snark in my heart. If it will quiet your conscience, you have permission to block and ignore these people. You don't want to even go to the funeral. Be blessed, you deserve peace.", "NTA. Just because someone is family doesn't mean you have to spend time with them. You've done well for yourself.
