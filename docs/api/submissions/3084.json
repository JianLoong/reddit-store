You were the child.  They did what they did and now they are reaping the consequences.  They stole from you and they undermined you.  As a result you don't feel safe with them.

If the day ever comes that they admit that they know what they did to you and are sorry for it perhaps there is a path forward to reconciliation but until then, focus on the people who love you and whatever else you can do to heal your heart from past hurts.
