Alexandra later texted me that I was an asshole and a prude for embarrassing her and Marcus like that.\n\n\nI showed the text to my husband and he said that while I was right, I could've been nicer about it.", "created_utc": 1697856268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17csk8t/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_boyfriend_to_stop/", "score": 953, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t just blame him.", "ESH. You really didn\u2019t have to make a scene and make everyone in the room more uncomfortable than they already were.

Mmm no SHE WAS laying all over him. Seeing as at gher age it's a bit late for the birds n bees talk. Sit them both down , especially that princess of a daughter, and explain to her/them your boundaries in regards to sexual behaviour.  Does she live with u still?

Why are you talking like you daughter was a passive party during the PDA?", "ESH. I had to laugh at your blaming Marcus when your daughter was on top of him. This \"excessive affection\" works two ways. They are young and infatuated and are bound to be doing a lot of groping, but they should not be doing it in front of the entire family.\n\nYou are an asshole for yelling at Marcus to stop groping, although you might have also admonished your daughter. You should have politely pointed out that this was not the time or the place for this kind of display of affection.", "ESH.  PDA, even if it's not exactly in public, is not appropriate, especially when a lot of family was there.  I don't know why you yelled at just Marcus, though.

Your daughter and her boyfriend are being inappropriate displaying intimacy to that degree in front of your family and you're in the wrong for openly calling them out on it in front of your guests. You need to be more tactful, you likely embarrassed every single person in that room, yourself included I imagine by drawing attention to it openly in front of your guests like that. Call your daughter to the other room and have a discreet word with her if she does something like that, don't shame her in front of her family. You didn't just embarrass her, you've made it unnecessarily difficult for her to attend family functions with your call out.

But, its is your home, your rules.", "YTA you should have spoken quietly to your daughter, not yelled at her boyfriend.\n\nThis could be regional, but to me the word groping implied that he grabbed her without consent.

You need to have a conversation with her about PDA instead of acting like her boyfriend assaulted her.", "YTA for your tantrum.", "ESH.\n\nYour daughter and her boyfriend are definitely old enough to know when enough is enough regarding PDAs. They're young enough to be really immature, but that's an explanation and not an excuse.\n\nHowever, you first of all should've  said this to *both of them*, and secondly - why on earth were you waiting until you snapped and yelled at them and called them disgusting? Like, you had plenty of time when you were calm when you could've said \"Guys, this is too much - save it for when you're alone together!\"\n\nIf they're old enough to know better, so are you.

If she wanted to be respectful.\n\nYou are the adult and should be setting a good example for both of them. You should have simply spoken to *both* then like adults. You're daughter is equally responsible for the PDA, unless you're saying she was being SA'd in your home. They *both* needed a calm explanation of behavioral expectations \n\nESH", "NTA. That degree of PDA did not need an audience. It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s just them in the room, but they were two out of seven people present, all family to your daughter (including her grandparents).

There\u2019s a right way and a wrong way. Yelling about this and calling it disgusting is more than a bit over the top. And I\u2019m not inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt when you even described long hugs as excessive.  Stop being such a stick in the mud. And if your daughter is engaging in massive tongue in the throat make out session with major major ass grabbing, the response should simply have been a \u201chey guys please save that for later but right now you\u2019re among family\u201d rather than yelling and calling it disgusting.", "ESH. They were behaving inappropriately, but yelling at them about it was also inappropriate.", "YTA. You asked about your behavior not theirs. You should have talked to her discreetly not exploding.", "Yta. \nShe spoke is a low voice, you could have done the same.", "ESH. Neither side behaved very well.", "ESH.\n\nThey should tone it down when they are at someone's house. Your daughter got too comfortable at your house and should be more considerate and respectful to everyone around her. \n\nYou were uncomfortable from the start and you bottled it up to the point of lashing out.

I have daughters who are almost of age and I just can't imagine them doing this. \n\nI get that young love is strong but in front of your family? Nah\n\nI feel like long drawn out kissing would be inappropriate on its own but with the ass groping its just so much worse. \n\nI hope I happily live out all my days without seeing a live action soft porn of my child", "I think you did the right thing, the boyfriend should have respect for yr daughter in front of other people well as she should have respect for herself while in front of family.. They should do that stuff in another place. I'd probably did the same about my child.", "When you say 'groping', what do you mean? Was his hand on her hip near her butt? Was it on her butt, motionless? Was he rubbing her butt? Was he noticeably squeezing her butt? Was he digging for gold?\n\nThere are so many different ways to take this and while each would be worse than the last, personally I wouldn't label the first 2 as groping.\n\nThat said, a little respect goes a long way. Heavy snogging on the couch in your parents house, while your parents are in the house, is a bit over the top and lacks respect IMHO.\n\nEdit: And what do you mean by 'sprawled out lying on him'? How wide is your couch? If it's what I mean when I say sprawled out, that doesn't sound comfortable for either of them and sounds like an extremely awkward position to relax in. If I were 'sprawled out' on my couch, half of me would be on the floor.", "ESH, why was he there in the first place, was everyone okay with his presence? And why were they allowed to kiss in front of elders?

They are 20! You know what kids do when they are 20, right?\nShould they do it in front of you like that? No, but its a learning experience and you just fucked up, big time in your daughters eyes.\nA simple talk would be nice, a warning or something, because they did nothing wrong.\nIf my GFs mom slapped me like that, I would not come around when you are there anymore.\n\nNext time, slap your daughter for allowing/accepting him doing that.", "YTA\n\n> letting her lay sprawled out on him on the couch.\n\nOh my the horror\n\nEnvy doesn't suit you.\n\nThe only thing might be the 'groping' her ass, but i have a feeling his hands were just there and you interpreted that as groping already.", "Yta.\n\nHoly shit everyone in this comment section talking about boundaries!  Boundaries are to be expressed before hand, so people can use those boundaries to make informed decisions. If you set the boundary before hand and they agreed to come over and follow that boundary I could understand your reaction. \n\nYou didn't though. You kept your boundary silent, and then you let resentment build bc they kept violating your boundaries, even though they didn't know what the boundary was to start with. \n\nYes, PDA has a time and place. But cuddling on the couch and long hugs? Sure the grab ass was a but much, but again, you held resentment all night from an unspoken boundary. You were excessive. \n\nYes 20 is an adult. So she SHOULD know that over the top PDA isn't cool. But she would only know that if you taught it to her, and since you expect her to read you mind to know your boundaries, I'm willing to bet you skipped that chat.", "YTA for placing all of the blame on Marcus.  This was a 50/50 thing.  \u201cLetting her lay sprawled out on him on the couch.\u201d  You\u2019re really blaming that on him?  Your daughter had just as much to do with it as he did.  Also YTA for announcing it in front of everyone.  You could have just as easily pulled your daughter aside and asked her to get a handle on things.", "NTA - BF was an ass to group a daughter in front of her own mother.  Who raises jerks like this?", "NTA\nIt's either immature behavior or youe daughter'a boyfriend was making a show of his ownership ovwr her and you need to keep a close eyw on her. Intimate actions for intimate spaces.", "ESH. It's obvious the daughter and her bf were being stupid. \n\nI'm annoyed by anyone saying NTA here. OP, you're being an asshole and a stupid one at that for unnecessarily yelling, and one who only yelled at Marcus and not at both individuals. They're a couple. They're equally guilty. You're a grown woman who understands how this works, you aren't a new parent, you should be able to handle this better.", "Snapping at them was rude, and completely inappropriate to do in front of people. What sort of example does that set? An extremely poor one. Your complaint should\u2019ve been a made to your daughter, in private. You humiliated them both. Shame on you.", "A soft ESH. You should have mentioned something earlier before snapping. Your daughter should have probably shown a bit more respect with her behaviour in her parents house.", "NTA.  They were behaving inappropriately", "NTA daughter's PDA was tacky and immature. She's 20 acting like a horny teen. She need's to grow up. Letting the bf grope her ass in front of her grandparents...wow. He should know better as well.", "ESH", "YTA\n\nYou made a scene.", "ESH except the husband, he seems cool.", "YTA\n\nYou could have said something before you lost your cool. Snapping like that is an AH move.", "ESH.. IMO, there's a time and place for affection, and in front of grandparents/parents is not it. \n\nHowever, it wasn't just Marcus behaving inappropriately; more than likely, he was following your daughter's lead. If this is her first serious relationship, which it sounds like it is, she may be trying to show off to the family and doing so in a very immature way. That doesn't excuse Marcus, if she was prompting it, he should've have stopped it. \n\nIt may have been better had you pulled your daughter aside and told her you were uncomfortable with THEIR behavior, but hindsight is 20/20. Perhaps now you should sit down with your daughter and explain that you're happy she found someone but they crossed a line. Set some boundaries and go from there.", "ESH public displays of affection that stray into sexual activity are absolutely inappropriate for a family gathering.\n\nCommunicating that fact was your job as a parent and you failed miserably.\n\nYou were so overwhelmed by your feelings that you vomited that feeling out as anger.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a parent long enough to know that shame is an ineffective teaching strategy.", "So long kissing, drawn out hugging and sprawling with some lite hand stuff is bad now ? Just think of all the depraved shit they did once you kicked them out.", "Slightly ESH \n\nI completely understand your discomfort and think it\u2019s only fair that you said something given how you felt and that it was inappropriate in front of the company there. I do think you could have also done it in a more appropriate manner (e.g., pulling them BOTH aside and asking them to tone it down). \nI also think they are slightly immature for thinking it would be appropriate to act in such a way in front of everyone. This is definitely on both of them, but given your daughter knows the people around, it would make more sense for her to lead by example (given that we don\u2019t know what he\u2019s been exposed to in the past). \nIn terms of moving forward, I think as adults you should all just sit down to talk about how you felt and how in future more appropriate actions and communications can be made (you and them)", "ESH, your daughter and her bf should know better but also your reaction was way too over the top. I'd expect yelling out of the blue if it wasn't consensual- not if you're just uncomfortable about something they're doing. I will add though that your definition of overly affectionate is drastically different than my own house, and therefore might be for Marcus as well. The groping, obviously. But hugging for a long time? Laying on each other on the couch? That'd be perfectly normal to me. Unless you've asked for them to not do that in front of you already, I'd say you're the bigger AH by far.", "Yta not for being uncomfortable but for how you handled it ultimately they are adults if this was your friend and her husband or whatever I seriously doubt you\u2019d of said the same. You could of had a calm talk with your daughter later privately there was zero need for your public attack.", "NTA - making out infront of other people is tacky as hell.  Everyone I know stopped doing that nonsense once we hit 16 or so.", "Nta - PDA\u2019s are fine, but she\u2019s old enough to know what appropriate behaviour is in public and private and while this was among family in a private home, it still wasn\u2019t PRIVATE. If they are so horny they need can\u2019t stop touching each other, then stay home.", "NTA, this kind of behavior in front of parents is just wild", "E(kinda)SH but you the least.  Sure, you should have pulled your daughter aside first before going nuclear but like I always told my kids (who are also both in their twenties) when they were young \"know your audience\".  I don't mind if you swear around your friends but don't curse like a sailor in front of grandma.  I don't care that you make out with your partner but also don't go grope in front of grandma.  Your daughter at 20 should know better as should her boyfriend.  These are teachable moments and that again is why you should have pulled your daughter aside instead of going scorched earth but it's unfortunately after the fact.\n\nI will say I think this is a good opportunity to talk to her once tempers have cooled.  You don't have to treat her like a child but I would ask her if *she* thinks it was appropriate without being accusatory.  My guess is if she's honest with herself and how you approach it, she will see your POV but if you go into it guns blazing again, I doubt it would be a productive discussion.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. The biggest asshole thing to me is blaming Marcus, rather than both of them, for what was happening. \"letting her lay sprawled out on him on the couch\", unless he's forcibly dragged her on top of him, she's choosing to be in that position. The reason I've gone with YTA instead of ESH is simply because of the levels, PDA from a young adult couple, yeah it's a bit much maybe, but it's not the worst thing in the world, and a quick \"knock it off\", or a quiet word to your daughter would have been enough to get them to tone it down. Yelling and causing a scene, blaming solely Marcus, and even trying to stop your daughter from leaving when she calmly wanted to escape your behaviour, all raise red flags to me about your wider behaviour.", "NTA. I\u2019m 22(f) and I could never imagine letting my boyfriend do that around anyone in my family. I won\u2019t even give him a quick peck if my parents or grandparents are around. I feel like it\u2019s disrespectful and it simply makes me uncomfortable.", "I'm going to say YTA for calling out your daughter's boyfriend but not your daughter as well. They both were acting in an inappropriate way. Not just the boyfriend. Other than that, I'd say no. Personally, I would've been a little more discreet, but it's your household. Maybe next time, try not to have a blind spot for your daughter. That's not meant to be mean. I have a daughter myself. It's so easy to get wrapped up in \"my child is an angel.\" No, they're not. They are humans with human flaws. Just like us. When they're doing something that needs to be corrected, well, correct them.", "NTA.

YTA for how you handle it as well. \n\nYour not an AH for asking them to respect your wishes in your home, but this isn't close to what you did. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, you can ask, but they certainly don't have to come over any more.", "ESH. Their behavior was inappropriate, but you could have handled it better.", "YTA you clearly either never were or don't remember what it's like to be young and in love. Further what is your problem?

When she first introduced us, I was happy and thought he was really nice and good for her.\n\nToday, my husband and I had my parents and my sister come over to our house, Alexandra was also there and invited Marcus over as well, which I was fine with. \n\n\nAfter Alexandra was done introducing Marcus to her grandparents and aunt, I noticed that Marcus seemed excessively showing my daughter affection such as long drawn out kissing, hugging her for long periods, and letting her lay sprawled out on him on the couch. \n\nIt made me feel uncomfortable but I let it slide   until I noticed Marcus was groping my daughter's ass while they kissed on one of my living room coaches.\n\nI snapped by yelling, making them break away from each other and said that Marcus needed to stop groping my daughter because it made me uncomfortable  and it was disgusting to do in front of other people.\n\nThere was silence until my daughter stood up and told me that she was leaving in a quiet tone.\n\nI tried to stop her but she left anyways with Marcus. Alexandra later texted me that I was an asshole and a prude for embarrassing her and Marcus like that.\n\n\nI showed the text to my husband and he said that while I was right, I could've been nicer about it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get so mad at my husband if he even hugs me too long in public, because it feels awkward and it makes me uncomfortable (we are both 23).\n\nNTA for your feelings, but you could have walked up to them and told them to stop in a lower volume. Yelling brings everyone else in the house into the situation, and based on the reaction your daughter had in the moment (not yelling back but leaving quietly) it sounds like she is very noncombative and probably really hates it when other people hear her problems. I understand why you were upset, but \\*i feel\\* you should try at least try to say something in a more respectful way before you make a scene out of it, especially if you know your daughter is quiet like that. Just a \"don't do that in my living room\" or something like that in a volume only they could hear. That probably could have solved the problem without upsetting everyone.

Yes sure, perhaps they could touch each other more in private but it seems like your problem was more about your daughter having a sexuality than the PDA.

This level of PDA is completely unacceptable.", "My thought, too, was to pull the daughter aside and address the issue quietly with her. Daughter should be the one responsible for making sure the guest she brought behaves appropriately. I would also expect the daughter to be a better judge of what is appropriate for the company (than the boyfriend) since it's her family.\n\nYelling at the boyfriend was probably more embarrassing than the behavior OP was trying to correct.", "Even when I was 18 I knew grabbing my gf's arse in front of family/anyone was not only innapropriate but cringe levels of pda. They needed to literally get a room. NTA", "Children have free will and aren't copies of their parents. It isn't fair to assume daughter's misbehavior is OP's fault.

Kids and adults alike do shit they were raised to not do all the time. Her daughter is an asshole.", "I would love to have seen how far they would have gone if nobody said anything to them.

Maybe the daughter was openly okay with doing things/being involved in a situation that wasn\u2019t appropriate for a family gathering. At the same time, maybe she was not okay with it. Maybe the daughter didn\u2019t have the proper skills or ability to feel like they could communicate her preferences with her BF when it comes to PDA. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to discuss the topic fully, between OP and the daughter, leaving room for discussion on her feelings and intentions before openly chastising or disapproving of the situation.

Hell, my Cajun grandparents would\u2019ve put a stop to it as well.", "That's fair, I do agree with that. I think in an ideal situation it would have been handled a lot calmer. Making a big ordeal of it in that way also just draws more attention to it regardless.", "I agree. A different commenter mentioned something similar as well and I reconsidered from the point of view of the daughter and felt differently.\n\nAt the time I wrote the comment I was thinking about the shock of the mother being surprised by that behavior and how that could lead you to react in a way that wasn't ideal but could be understood.\n\nI now agree that the way she handled it wasn't helpful to the situation and it could have definitely been approached in a more gentle manner.\n\nI do still agree both should have known better and shouldn't have been surprised when their behavior was pointed out.\n\nHowever, I don't think yelling at your daughter or using words like \"disgusting\" is helpful to the situation in any way.", "That was hilarious.", "But she agreed. she willingly layed on him.

Or is it two hands with attention focused?\n\nAre they talking, laughing, and kissing on the couch together while everyone hangs out? Or are they ignoring everyone and tounging each other during a movie?\n\nA shoulder massage with closed eyes and moaning can be uncomfortably intimate for people to be around, while squeezing your wife's tits going, \"honk honk,\" would barely catch any attention. There is just too much nuance to be sussed out for an agreement here.\n\nBut I'll say mom blaming him for \"letting her lay on him\" makes me think it's otherwise innocent enough behavior being blown out of proportion.

But your point is made.", "right - usually the person whos house/family it is decides the level of pda theyre comfy with. id guess the daughter was initiating bc she was comfortable and he was following her lead", "I don't disagree with both your points but the only other way to say he gave consent for her to be all over him would be \"let her stay sprawled about\" type line... or that he was fine with her being all over him. With the whole tone though, op obviously is blaming him more than her. \n\nI know it's hard to realize your kids can be lecherous but once they're an adult, get over it lol\n\nBut yeah, socially appropriate pda regardless and ass groping while making out with all the relatives there is a little too much.", "[deleted]", "I think it kinda depends on the sprawling. I've absolutely taken naps on top of boyfriends when staying over for a few days but like, it was literally just to be able to lay with him and sleep \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. No ass groping nor kissing even, because decency", "Yeah, you're projecting for sure. She held back and didn't say a word until she felt it got excessive and inappropriate.", "NTA \n\nI think your take on the situation is clouded by a personal narrative.", "PDA is icky? Serious question, I\u2019d love to know people\u2019s opinions on PDA and what is ok and what is not because I may have been inappropriate my entire life with my partners. I am very kissy, huggy with my partners in public, maybe not around family, family events. Don\u2019t know why that is less icky to me, probably shouldn\u2019t be. Anyway, love to have some perspectives on this. I might be severely out of touch because now I\u2019m thinking of all the times that I\u2019ve been kissing, hugging in public. \ud83d\ude16", "They were being sarcastic", "as a 22 year old who live alone with my SO, this is not defendable at all, even if family visit our place. sneaky hugs and smacks, at most.", "100% agree. Righteous ESH, if someone\u2019s behaviour is inappropriate, it doesn\u2019t help to escalate the situation by snapping, yelling, and calling them \u201cdisgusting\u201d.", "Exactly what I was thinking. I shouldn't be surprised that so many people think the best way to handle a situation like is is to start yelling. Maybe OP should reflect on that AH behavior while calmly discussing the daughter's AH behavior.", "Great judgment on your part!", "I had a serious boyfriend back when I was 20. I can picture the rubbing and squeezing someone does when hands are moving and kissing is happening.  It would be too much to be doing with grandma and grandpa in the room for sure.  \n\nI've always been more reserved with PDA so usually my family sees a kiss and leaning into eachother. But I have a baby; they're all adult enough to know how that happened.  No need to display how passionately we are drawn to each other on the couch in front of Grama.\n\n\nI'm sorry,  Is your last line saying that OP's husband needs to physically grab her chest and making audible honking sounds? Is that going to solve the problem of two young adults getting frisky to an inappropriate extent in an occupied space?", "Whatever works at the moment, I suppose.", "Adults. Adults acting in appropriately in someone else's home around their family.", "I\u2019d assume it\u2019s the one grabbing ass not the one whose ass it is that gets yelled at you odd L", "what do you mean \u201ccontrolling someone\u2019s every move\u201d? the point isn\u2019t him being controlling, the point is why is the situation framed as the bf allowing it vs \u201cshe was sprawled out on top of him\u201d because she chose to be.", "So, letting her sprawl on him is bad, but doing the actual sprawling isn't.  Is that how your double standard works?", "No. She said \"allowed her to lay sprawled out.\" That's infantilizing. She was responsible for being sprawled out over her boyfriend.\n\nA sane reasonable adult would have said \"your pda is making me very uncomfortable, please stop.\" YTA", "kissing and hugging is normal. groping is getting a handful of something that should not be get in public", "Kisses on the cheek and hand holding are publically acceptable. Anything that could possibly be construed as foreplay shouldn\u2019t be in public view.", "No hands in \u2018bikini\u2019 zones, no tonsil hockey, no rubbing up against each other or otherwise re-creating soft porn.", "Pay attention to how other couples behave. Do they do this too? Not very many. Do you think that's because they're just not into each other? If so, you're wrong. Most people are uncomfortable showing and seeing that amount of affection activity in public.", "personally, PDA makes me violently uncomfortable", "When people grow up around adults that never show PDA, it can feel like it's something not meant to be seen/behind closed doors only. If you're around adults that hug, hold hands, cuddle on the sofa, etc, it feels normal.\n\nI think holding hands, shortish kisses, arms around the waist but not grabbing ass, arms linked, and hugs are pretty common. Admittedly, it took me a bit to feel comfortable around that in closer quarters, because my parents hated each other during the second half of my childhood, so I just hadn't been exposed to it.", "Well, also depends on what in public means. If it means sitting outside at a caf\u00e9 then it is ok to hug and kiss, as long as it is not, as others already said, like a foreplay, but otherwise show your love if you want. But if you are in actual company then please, just hold hands, or lay them on your partners knee (as long as it is not rubbing around) and some kiss here and there. Being in company of a couple that can't let their fingers from each is just annoying, even if it is not like a foreplay. \n\nIt is like some people want viewers or something but believe me, no one is interested in watching how you can't focus onto anything else. Yes, we're happy you're happy, we still have no interest in getting a show.", "Unlike Hot Refrigerator above/below me, I love that you show PDA and express yourself. I want to see more of that confidence and intimacy in the world and think its healthy. You're exactly the kind of people I like running in to in the world.\n\nYou should just do what you want and love your life not worry about making other people uncomfortable for the most part. No matter what you do, someone will be uncomfortable and someone will love it.", "They probably still think girls have cooties and u have to draw 2 circles and 2 dots to protect urself from them.", "Their behavior isn't defendable. Neither is unnecessary yelling from the mother wtf. Let's not justify escalating small issues into bigger ones.", "sure i just meant like she mightve been the one who initiated the making out and the laying on him on the couch etc. both of them were responsible - not just him is all haha", "[deleted]", "\"Anything that could possibly be construed as foreplay\" is such a good description of PDA", "Well put, Diana Prince.", "This", "That's some strict arbitrary lines you out there, religious upbringing?", "And if you are around family:  No tongue.\n\nSave it for around your peer group.   Some parents get creeped out easily.", "Lol I feel like for me it really depends on how I feel about love in the situation. If I am fulfilled PDA is like Awe\u2026 but when I am heartbroken or lonely even people holding hands is icky as hell \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "All kinds? Like holding hands and hugging too?", "what, am i not allowed to find something uncomfortable. They asked for peoples thoughts on PDA i gave my thoughts i dont understand the backhanded comments on my own experience", "agree. all people involved are adults and yelling was uncalled for. a startled reaction will be reasonable but not a whole yelling speech.", "\"let her!?!?\" That's absurd. It's specifically wording it in a way to make him responsible for her actions instead of the daughter being responsible for her own actions. That's madness.", "Thank you!  I love words and language so this really brightened my day!", "Thank you!", "Not especially I don\u2019t think. However, manners and decency were stressed but not thru edicts, just watched how my parents behaved.  \nMy elder sis was told privately by my Mother that some of her and her boyfriend\u2019s behavior was \u201cnot nice\u201d in public (our kitchen) and she was correct. No one else should have to watch other people getting their engines revved, boats floated, rocks off, etc. without their consent.", "that\u2019s usually not what anyone ever complains when it comes to pda. i could just be wrong, but most people are specifically against sexual touching and making out. considering that is what\u2019s referred in this thread, i\u2019d assume they mean groping and such unless they say otherwise. i don\u2019t get what is so hard about keeping it private \ud83e\udd76 seems like a kink thing when people won\u2019t just let shit go", "why would i care if someone is holding hands or hugging", "Yup thanks anyone saying NTA doesn't understand how to deescalate and is straight up encouraging bad parenting tbh. It's kind of irritating to me. Call out anyone who deserves it.", "We'd be friends. I can tell \ud83e\udd1d", "Wouldn\u2018t this also apply to revealing clothing? Nobody should have to watch your sexual characteristics without consent.", "Just like with feeling each other up and making out in public, just because something isn\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) be illegal doesn\u2019t mean that it is socially acceptable. Each person has to decide if they care about societal boundaries and structures or not, and, if they care, to what extent. \nIn is nigh impossible to get people to admit, not to actually think, but to admit that they find skimpy or overly tight clothing to be tacky/trashy on men and women for fear of being ostracized for \u201cjudging\u201d others. In truth, likely 90% of any community probably agrees on what is or isn\u2019t appropriate. So, yes, clothing can make a person uncomfortable but, as long as they are covered then that is just the price of living in a free society."]}
