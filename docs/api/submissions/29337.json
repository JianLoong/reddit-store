Alexandra later texted me that I was an asshole and a prude for embarrassing her and Marcus like that.\n\n\nI showed the text to my husband and he said that while I was right, I could've been nicer about it.", "created_utc": 1697856268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17csk8t/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_boyfriend_to_stop/", "score": 10198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It could have been handled in a much better way. Yelling and using words like \u201cdisgusting\u201d just makes a scene and drives a wedge between OP and their daughter. I can still understand why OP may have responded the way they did due to the surprise/shock of the situation. But it still would have been more productive for the situation and for their relationship to have handled it in a more gentle way.\n\nUltimately they should have known better. They shouldn\u2019t have had to be told not to be doing what they were doing. And I firmly stand by that. \n\nOP could have been gentler with the approach.", "ESH you could have handled it better instead of snapping and also remember your daughter was also participating\u2026 not just him. Yes I grope my girls ass plenty and she enjoys it because she\u2019s part of it\u2026 she squeezes my butt too occasionally. We may not do it in public but point is they were both doing this. Don\u2019t just blame him.", "ESH. You really didn\u2019t have to make a scene and make everyone in the room more uncomfortable than they already were. You should have pulled your daughter aside to talk about it. Humiliating them like that is going to have a negative impact on your relationship long term.", "He LET HER lay all over him. Mmm no SHE WAS laying all over him. Seeing as at gher age it's a bit late for the birds n bees talk. Sit them both down , especially that princess of a daughter, and explain to her/them your boundaries in regards to sexual behaviour.  Does she live with u still?

You should have politely pointed out that this was not the time or the place for this kind of display of affection.", "ESH.  PDA, even if it's not exactly in public, is not appropriate, especially when a lot of family was there.  I don't know why you yelled at just Marcus, though.

Your daughter could have easily asked him to stop if SHE didn\u2019t want him touching her. \n\nESH.

You need to have a conversation with her about PDA instead of acting like her boyfriend assaulted her.", "YTA for your tantrum.", "ESH.\n\nYour daughter and her boyfriend are definitely old enough to know when enough is enough regarding PDAs. They're young enough to be really immature, but that's an explanation and not an excuse.\n\nHowever, you first of all should've  said this to *both of them*, and secondly - why on earth were you waiting until you snapped and yelled at them and called them disgusting? Like, you had plenty of time when you were calm when you could've said \"Guys, this is too much - save it for when you're alone together!\"\n\nIf they're old enough to know better, so are you.

That degree of PDA did not need an audience.

There\u2019s a right way and a wrong way. Yelling about this and calling it disgusting is more than a bit over the top. And I\u2019m not inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt when you even described long hugs as excessive.  Stop being such a stick in the mud. And if your daughter is engaging in massive tongue in the throat make out session with major major ass grabbing, the response should simply have been a \u201chey guys please save that for later but right now you\u2019re among family\u201d rather than yelling and calling it disgusting.", "ESH.

Neither side behaved very well.", "ESH.\n\nThey should tone it down when they are at someone's house.

I have daughters who are almost of age and I just can't imagine them doing this. \n\nI get that young love is strong but in front of your family? Nah\n\nI feel like long drawn out kissing would be inappropriate on its own but with the ass groping its just so much worse. \n\nI hope I happily live out all my days without seeing a live action soft porn of my child", "I think you did the right thing, the boyfriend should have respect for yr daughter in front of other people well as she should have respect for herself while in front of family.. They should do that stuff in another place. I'd probably did the same about my child.", "When you say 'groping', what do you mean? Was his hand on her hip near her butt? Was it on her butt, motionless? Was he rubbing her butt? Was he noticeably squeezing her butt? Was he digging for gold?\n\nThere are so many different ways to take this and while each would be worse than the last, personally I wouldn't label the first 2 as groping.\n\nThat said, a little respect goes a long way. Heavy snogging on the couch in your parents house, while your parents are in the house, is a bit over the top and lacks respect IMHO.\n\nEdit: And what do you mean by 'sprawled out lying on him'? How wide is your couch? If it's what I mean when I say sprawled out, that doesn't sound comfortable for either of them and sounds like an extremely awkward position to relax in. If I were 'sprawled out' on my couch, half of me would be on the floor.", "ESH, why was he there in the first place, was everyone okay with his presence?

They are 20! You know what kids do when they are 20, right?\nShould they do it in front of you like that? No, but its a learning experience and you just fucked up, big time in your daughters eyes.\nA simple talk would be nice, a warning or something, because they did nothing wrong.\nIf my GFs mom snapped at me like that, I would not come around when you are there anymore.\n\nNext time, snap your daughter for allowing/accepting him doing that.\n\nEDIT: snap, not slap. Comment still stands thou:)", "YTA\n\n> letting her lay sprawled out on him on the couch.\n\nOh my the horror\n\nEnvy doesn't suit you.\n\nThe only thing might be the 'groping' her ass, but i have a feeling his hands were just there and you interpreted that as groping already.", "Yta.\n\nHoly shit everyone in this comment section talking about boundaries!  Boundaries are to be expressed before hand, so people can use those boundaries to make informed decisions. If you set the boundary before hand and they agreed to come over and follow that boundary I could understand your reaction. \n\nYou didn't though. You kept your boundary silent, and then you let resentment build bc they kept violating your boundaries, even though they didn't know what the boundary was to start with. \n\nYes, PDA has a time and place. But cuddling on the couch and long hugs? Sure the grab ass was a but much, but again, you held resentment all night from an unspoken boundary. You were excessive. \n\nYes 20 is an adult. So she SHOULD know that over the top PDA isn't cool. But she would only know that if you taught it to her, and since you expect her to read you mind to know your boundaries, I'm willing to bet you skipped that chat.", "YTA for placing all of the blame on Marcus.

Intimate actions for intimate spaces.", "ESH. It's obvious the daughter and her bf were being stupid. \n\nI'm annoyed by anyone saying NTA here. OP, you're being an asshole and a stupid one at that for unnecessarily yelling, and one who only yelled at Marcus and not at both individuals. They're a couple. They're equally guilty. You're a grown woman who understands how this works, you aren't a new parent, you should be able to handle this better.", "Snapping at them was rude, and completely inappropriate to do in front of people.

Snapping like that is an AH move.", "ESH.. IMO, there's a time and place for affection, and in front of grandparents/parents is not it. \n\nHowever, it wasn't just Marcus behaving inappropriately; more than likely, he was following your daughter's lead. If this is her first serious relationship, which it sounds like it is, she may be trying to show off to the family and doing so in a very immature way. That doesn't excuse Marcus, if she was prompting it, he should've have stopped it. \n\nIt may have been better had you pulled your daughter aside and told her you were uncomfortable with THEIR behavior, but hindsight is 20/20. Perhaps now you should sit down with your daughter and explain that you're happy she found someone but they crossed a line. Set some boundaries and go from there.", "ESH public displays of affection that stray into sexual activity are absolutely inappropriate for a family gathering.\n\nCommunicating that fact was your job as a parent and you failed miserably.\n\nYou were so overwhelmed by your feelings that you vomited that feeling out as anger.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a parent long enough to know that shame is an ineffective teaching strategy.", "So long kissing, drawn out hugging and sprawling with some lite hand stuff is bad now ? Just think of all the depraved shit they did once you kicked them out.", "Slightly ESH \n\nI completely understand your discomfort and think it\u2019s only fair that you said something given how you felt and that it was inappropriate in front of the company there. I do think you could have also done it in a more appropriate manner (e.g., pulling them BOTH aside and asking them to tone it down). \nI also think they are slightly immature for thinking it would be appropriate to act in such a way in front of everyone. This is definitely on both of them, but given your daughter knows the people around, it would make more sense for her to lead by example (given that we don\u2019t know what he\u2019s been exposed to in the past). \nIn terms of moving forward, I think as adults you should all just sit down to talk about how you felt and how in future more appropriate actions and communications can be made (you and them)", "ESH, your daughter and her bf should know better but also your reaction was way too over the top. I'd expect yelling out of the blue if it wasn't consensual- not if you're just uncomfortable about something they're doing. I will add though that your definition of overly affectionate is drastically different than my own house, and therefore might be for Marcus as well. The groping, obviously. But hugging for a long time? Laying on each other on the couch? That'd be perfectly normal to me. Unless you've asked for them to not do that in front of you already, I'd say you're the bigger AH by far.", "Yta not for being uncomfortable but for how you handled it ultimately they are adults if this was your friend and her husband or whatever I seriously doubt you\u2019d of said the same. You could of had a calm talk with your daughter later privately there was zero need for your public attack.", "NTA - making out infront of other people is tacky as hell.  Everyone I know stopped doing that nonsense once we hit 16 or so.", "[deleted]", "NTA, this kind of behavior in front of parents is just wild", "E(kinda)SH but you the least.  Sure, you should have pulled your daughter aside first before going nuclear but like I always told my kids (who are also both in their twenties) when they were young \"know your audience\".  I don't mind if you swear around your friends but don't curse like a sailor in front of grandma.  I don't care that you make out with your partner but also don't go grope in front of grandma.  Your daughter at 20 should know better as should her boyfriend.  These are teachable moments and that again is why you should have pulled your daughter aside instead of going scorched earth but it's unfortunately after the fact.\n\nI will say I think this is a good opportunity to talk to her once tempers have cooled.  You don't have to treat her like a child but I would ask her if *she* thinks it was appropriate without being accusatory.  My guess is if she's honest with herself and how you approach it, she will see your POV but if you go into it guns blazing again, I doubt it would be a productive discussion.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. The biggest asshole thing to me is blaming Marcus, rather than both of them, for what was happening. \"letting her lay sprawled out on him on the couch\", unless he's forcibly dragged her on top of him, she's choosing to be in that position. The reason I've gone with YTA instead of ESH is simply because of the levels, PDA from a young adult couple, yeah it's a bit much maybe, but it's not the worst thing in the world, and a quick \"knock it off\", or a quiet word to your daughter would have been enough to get them to tone it down. Yelling and causing a scene, blaming solely Marcus, and even trying to stop your daughter from leaving when she calmly wanted to escape your behaviour, all raise red flags to me about your wider behaviour.", "NTA.

They both were acting in an inappropriate way. Not just the boyfriend. Other than that, I'd say no. Personally, I would've been a little more discreet, but it's your household. Maybe next time, try not to have a blind spot for your daughter. That's not meant to be mean. I have a daughter myself. It's so easy to get wrapped up in \"my child is an angel.\" No, they're not. They are humans with human flaws. Just like us. When they're doing something that needs to be corrected, well, correct them.", "NTA.

Alexandra later texted me that I was an asshole and a prude for embarrassing her and Marcus like that.\n\n\nI showed the text to my husband and he said that while I was right, I could've been nicer about it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get so mad at my husband if he even hugs me too long in public, because it feels awkward and it makes me uncomfortable (we are both 23).\n\nNTA for your feelings, but you could have walked up to them and told them to stop in a lower volume.

I understand why you were upset, but \\*i feel\\* you should try at least try to say something in a more respectful way before you make a scene out of it, especially if you know your daughter is quiet like that.

This level of PDA is completely unacceptable.", "My thought, too, was to pull the daughter aside and address the issue quietly with her. Daughter should be the one responsible for making sure the guest she brought behaves appropriately.

Hell, my Cajun grandparents would\u2019ve put a stop to it as well.", "That's fair, I do agree with that. I think in an ideal situation it would have been handled a lot calmer. Making a big ordeal of it in that way also just draws more attention to it regardless.", "I agree. A different commenter mentioned something similar as well and I reconsidered from the point of view of the daughter and felt differently.\n\nAt the time I wrote the comment I was thinking about the shock of the mother being surprised by that behavior and how that could lead you to react in a way that wasn't ideal but could be understood.\n\nI now agree that the way she handled it wasn't helpful to the situation and it could have definitely been approached in a more gentle manner.\n\nI do still agree both should have known better and shouldn't have been surprised when their behavior was pointed out.\n\nHowever, I don't think yelling at your daughter or using words like \"disgusting\" is helpful to the situation in any way.", "That was hilarious.", "But she agreed. she willingly layed on him.

Or is it two hands with attention focused?\n\nAre they talking, laughing, and kissing on the couch together while everyone hangs out? Or are they ignoring everyone and tounging each other during a movie?\n\nA shoulder massage with closed eyes and moaning can be uncomfortably intimate for people to be around, while squeezing your wife's tits going, \"honk honk,\" would barely catch any attention.

It's really uncomfortable for everyone around them and completely disrespectful.", "i haven\u2019t read the comments yet but i think op was in the right for braking that contact, i do think it wasn\u2019t the right approach tho. I\u2019ve had this conversation with my psychologist and she agrees that it\u2019s completely disrespectful to maintain this SEXUAL behaviour in front of people, there\u2019s places and situations for this. \nParents don\u2019t need to see their kids being sexually touched by their significant other, Their kids don\u2019t need to see their parents being sexual in front of them either. \n\nOP approached this badly but it was a boundary that needed to be set out of respect for everyone, the daughter needs to learn respect, respect for herself and for the people that surround her. \nNTA but could\u2019ve had a better approach.", "NTA \n\nMen create the atmosphere women set the tone. I see comments that are trying to defend your daughters boyfriend. \n\nThere is no defense for him. He is a guest in your home he should be showing respect to you and your husband AS WELL AS YOUR PARENTS. \n\nAny parent in their right mind would address that, your daughter does not need to be doing that in front of you. \n\nThey both crossed a line. You should have approached the situation softer however YOU REACTED LIKE A NORMAL CONCERNED PARENT. \n\nmoving forward I would be having a chat with both of them as it is your home and your rules. \n\nIf my boyfriend tried to do that I would shut him down and display the boundaries in my home\n(Something your daughter should have done) \n\n\n( I have no kids of my own only siblings and I'm the oldest  but still relatively  young I would never DARE doing this in front of my parents or my grand parents absolutely horrifying!!!", "NTA. Omg the way I would never do this. In my father\u2019s house, this is disrespectful. I am able to peck my bf on the lips or hug him, but the whole make out and groping would neverrrr be ok. That\u2019s gross to do in front of anyone, period. The fact she is so ok with that is weird. They can take it anywhere else. That\u2019s so weird. NTA.", "So when you were in your twenties, did you grope your partners in front of your parents?", "I remember being 20.

I always feel like I have to tone down the scenario OP writes about due to their bias and exaggeration to seem more favorable.  For all we know they were just kissing and there wasn't groping involved just regular affection.  Not only that but OP admits they got uncomfortable with \"drawn out kisses\" and \"long hugs\".  Like what? Sounds like OP is just a prude.  IDK how top comment saying NTA considering that even if both, not just Marcus,  were being inappropriate OP reacted like an AH/child", "Who cares. They both acted inappropriately. Maybe he needed to hear it.", "Yep, very much doesn\u2019t feel like OP sees his daughter as an adult.", "They would have been embarrassed if she pulled them aside and talked to them about it. She didn\u2019t have to humiliate them like that.", "It\u2019s not prudish to expect anyone to show a certain amount of respect in someone else\u2019s home.", "Grabbing an ass is sexual, but within my family and circle of friends it's generally acceptable if you're reasonable about it. Like, grab the ass and move on, no one is weirded out and it's not viewed as inappropriate. Go beyond a quick grab? It gets weird fast.", "Seriously? What families run around grabbing assets?", "Holy crap THIS. I hope I never forget to respond this way with my kids because this is 100% the best way to handle it.", "This would be my go to as well. Oh, uncomfy PDA? Careful what you wish for, we have a 2 to 1 advantage of not wanting to think of us as sexual creatures.

In my opinion.\n\nAnd my original comment to you wasn\u2019t meant to provoke or insult you, yet you seemed to have taken offense with your *ass*uming comment. This seems to be a difference in interpretation if anything. But if I am assuming it\u2019s worse than it was, you arguably are viewing it as though what actually happened was not as bad as OP described it.", "Stacy can't you see, you're just not the girl for me.", "Almost tied at this point.", "Right now it's equal \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
