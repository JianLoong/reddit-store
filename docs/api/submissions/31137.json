We're both single parents, my fiancee passed away 5 years ago but her ex husband is still in the picture. Both our daughters go to the same school, mine is 14 while hers is 15. We don't live together yet, I want to finish the work on my house before they move in. We both have slightly different parenting techniques, she's more focused on her daughter having good grades, making sure she can get into a good university while my approach is more \"do what you want with your life I'll support you regardless\". \n\nLast weekend my daughter was supposed to go to a friend's 18th birthday party. They're not very close friends but she got invited. I knew that the girl's parents and other relatives would be there so I had no issue with letting her go. But last week my daughter asked her friend if my girlfriend's daughter could come to the party (they've become pretty good friends ever since we started dating) and her friend agreed. So I arranged everything with my girlfriend, so that her daughter would spend the weekend at my place instead of going to her dads. \n\nWhen Saturday came I picked up her daughter in the morning because my daughter wanted to go shopping with her before the party. Her daughter had brought a dress from home that she was supposed to wear, it was a full length dress. In the evening when the girls were getting ready her daughter decided that she didn't want to wear that dress but instead borrowed some of my daughters stuff so they could wear matching outfits, a skirt and a crop top. I never had an issue with anything my daughter wears, I always thought teenagers should be able to express themselves so I always just bought her whatever she liked. I dropped the girls off at the party at 10pm and then picked them up just before 1am (that's the time me and my girlfriend agreed on). Her daughter then spent the night at mine and I dropped her off back at my girlfriends on Sunday afternoon. \n\nBut Sunday evening she called me after she saw photos on Instagram that her daughter posted. She was furious at me for letting her daughter dress the way mine did, she said I was supposed to make sure her daughter wore that dress she brought with her. So I explained the whole situation to her but it just ended up in a huge fight between us. Since then we only talked once as she's still very upset with me. I told her she was overreacting. I honestly don't know what to think of this whole thing.

Honestly, teen girls, especially those who have undergone trauma like losing a mother, really need more than a \u201cdo what you want with your life\u201d approach to thrive.  I\u2019m personally not a fan of allowing a 14 year old to attend an 18 year old\u2019s birthday party where drinking will happen in a crop top and miniskirt, but that\u2019s me. It\u2019s a potentially dangerous situation for a young girl if there will be 18+ literally \u201cadult\u201d men there who could easily take advantage of someone that age. Speaking not just as a parent but as a person who was a young girl in this situation back in the day. I don\u2019t think I could co-parent with someone who felt like that was a good idea + was not into monitoring or caring about grades. You can absolutely make those parenting choices- but I feel like your styles are more than \u201cslightly\u201d different yet you don\u2019t quite see the size of that gap since you\u2019re the one on the \u201cgo live your life\u201d side. It\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re understating the situation though; for example I was hyper focused on school and grades as a kid so that would have been fine for me. It\u2019s less fine if the kid in question doesn\u2019t care.
