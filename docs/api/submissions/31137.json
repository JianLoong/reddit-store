We're both single parents, my fiancee passed away 5 years ago but her ex husband is still in the picture. Both our daughters go to the same school, mine is 14 while hers is 15. We don't live together yet, I want to finish the work on my house before they move in. We both have slightly different parenting techniques, she's more focused on her daughter having good grades, making sure she can get into a good university while my approach is more \"do what you want with your life I'll support you regardless\". \n\nLast weekend my daughter was supposed to go to a friend's 18th birthday party. They're not very close friends but she got invited. I knew that the girl's parents and other relatives would be there so I had no issue with letting her go. But last week my daughter asked her friend if my girlfriend's daughter could come to the party (they've become pretty good friends ever since we started dating) and her friend agreed. So I arranged everything with my girlfriend, so that her daughter would spend the weekend at my place instead of going to her dads. \n\nWhen Saturday came I picked up her daughter in the morning because my daughter wanted to go shopping with her before the party. Her daughter had brought a dress from home that she was supposed to wear, it was a full length dress. In the evening when the girls were getting ready her daughter decided that she didn't want to wear that dress but instead borrowed some of my daughters stuff so they could wear matching outfits, a skirt and a crop top. I never had an issue with anything my daughter wears, I always thought teenagers should be able to express themselves so I always just bought her whatever she liked. I dropped the girls off at the party at 10pm and then picked them up just before 1am (that's the time me and my girlfriend agreed on). Her daughter then spent the night at mine and I dropped her off back at my girlfriends on Sunday afternoon. \n\nBut Sunday evening she called me after she saw photos on Instagram that her daughter posted. She was furious at me for letting her daughter dress the way mine did, she said I was supposed to make sure her daughter wore that dress she brought with her. So I explained the whole situation to her but it just ended up in a huge fight between us. Since then we only talked once as she's still very upset with me. I told her she was overreacting. I honestly don't know what to think of this whole thing.

Honestly, teen girls, especially those who have undergone trauma like losing a mother, really need more than a \u201cdo what you want with your life\u201d approach to thrive.  I\u2019m personally not a fan of allowing a 14 year old to attend an 18 year old\u2019s birthday party where drinking will happen in a crop top and miniskirt, but that\u2019s me. It\u2019s a potentially dangerous situation for a young girl if there will be 18+ literally \u201cadult\u201d men there who could easily take advantage of someone that age. Speaking not just as a parent but as a person who was a young girl in this situation back in the day. I don\u2019t think I could co-parent with someone who felt like that was a good idea + was not into monitoring or caring about grades. You can absolutely make those parenting choices- but I feel like your styles are more than \u201cslightly\u201d different yet you don\u2019t quite see the size of that gap since you\u2019re the one on the \u201cgo live your life\u201d side. It\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re understating the situation though; for example I was hyper focused on school and grades as a kid so that would have been fine for me. It\u2019s less fine if the kid in question doesn\u2019t care.

You will surely end up in a lot of cross-fire between a young woman trying to become independent and her own person and a mom who believes her daughter needs to adhere to mom's fairly restrictive perspective.\n\nI'm glad your two daughters have developed a friendship.", "NTA\u2026 sooooo is she secretly judging your daughters clothes and your parenting style then?? I mean how could she not be. Sounds like she holds herself and her daughter in a higher regard or standard for some reason. I\u2019d be offended a bit. Obviously SHE wanted to wear more teenage like clothing.", "**NTA**\n\nOh OP I feel for you. Firstly, can I just say, from a parenting perspective I would be quite nervous to allow my 14 year old to go to an 18th birthday 10pm-1am. It sounds like rhere was family there and it may come down to the specifics of the event and people but it makes me nervous. Secondly, you were not explicitly told that she had to wear the dress provided but I suspect your GF probably told her daughter. They are teenage girls and it feels like kiddo might have thrown you royally under the bus here. Thirdly, I think that you and your GF need to do some work on parenting styles and expectations. From your point of view the rules were agreed no drinking and home at 1am. From her point of view she will be convinced that no outfits she finds inappropriate is a given. The issue is communication. Good luck. If your relationship makes it then the two girls will continue doing a number on both of you.", "NTA. How were you to know what your girlfriend allowed her daughter to wear out? If she was more involved in everything, she could have ensured that her daughter didn't go out wearing something she didn't approve of. If it mattered to her that much, why wasn't she more involved in policing what her daughter wore? It's not your fault.\n\nAlso, expecting a 15 year old going to a late party to not want to wear a skirt... really?", "My mom was like your gf for a bit, she got mad because I changed my tshirt into a tank with a long sleeve mesh top over it for a friends sweet 16. She learned quickly after that, that I was finding my own style and it didn\u2019t align with hers.", "NTA. This is a small flag though, you and your GF need to make sure you're on the same page for parenting styles. If she was that angry that her daughter wore something she didn't approve of, it could cause a lot of tension when you live together and the daughters start pushing against that.", "NTA for clothing; you didn\u2019t know.\n\nYTA for the \u201cthis isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d. It clearly is my dude!! It\u2019s a big deal to her! \n\nTeenage girls and clothes are a really tough issue, and there aren\u2019t hard and fast rules.\n\nI\u2019m in favor of limited \u201cwear what you want\u201d with some leeway for parents to say no because of weather, inconvenience (ex: you can\u2019t take this off to pee by yourself), safety (ex: doesn\u2019t know how to walk in heels) genitals out, and occasion (ex: don\u2019t wear jeans to a black-tie wedding).\n\nAlso. As a woman. Dressing sexy means men/boys are more likely to approach you romantically. Is your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s daughter prepared and ready for those interactions?\n\nAnd I\u2019m not talking about harassment. I mean another 15 year old at the party telling her she\u2019s pretty and asking if she wants to see a movie. Does she know how to reject someone kindly? Is she open to dating? Does this kind of attention scare her? Has she even been told this is a possibility? \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to know why your fianc\u00e9e was so set on that long dress. I think it\u2019s important to have a conversation about that.", "NTA - unless your gf explicity stated that she was to wear that specific dress to the party, you had no way to know you were supposed to enforce a dress code. You aren't a mind reader.", "I mean you could have called your girlfriend and asked, but mostly it deppends if she specified ahead of time that you have to make sure her daughter wears the dress.", "I have a slightly different take. ESH (adults only). NTA for letting her wear what she wore. YATA for fighting her mom about it. This is one of those, \u201cI misunderstood and I apologize,\u201d situations where you let the anger cool and *maybe* discuss it later when it can be calm and rational, although I\u2019m generally in favor of letting parents parent how they want. I understand that it\u2019s probably difficult in this situation, but I think it generally still stands.", "INFO:\n\n> She was furious at me for letting her daughter dress the way mine did\n\nHow did she state this? How is her relationship with your daughter? As a parent I\u2019d be more worried about that, really.", "NTA. Your girlfriend needs to be clearer about her expectations in the future. The only one she can blame for this is herself and you are spot on that she's overreacting by putting the blame on you like that. Especially since it's about clothes of all things. Just think about it, if she so strongly dislikes the clothes that you daughter wears then how are things going to go if the two kids keep spending time together? Your girlfriend needs to face reality on this one.", "Look my ex husband is a coercive and controlling person. He always wanted to control what our child wore. In its least toxic form this pushes children away. In its most toxic form it becomes actual abuse with emotional abuse, rage, and other things I won\u2019t go into. You don\u2019t live with your girlfriend but do you really know her, and do you really want this person around your teenager.  Any adult you introduce into your home impacts the well-being of your child.

People would be calling you a controlling AH left right and centre if you had.", "NTA. At that age it's normal to choose their own clothes and wear what their friends are wearing. She's wrong to expect you to assume to know that she has a different set of standards for her kid when she hasn't even taught her daughter those supposed standards.", "Wish you were my dad. She should\u2019ve made her expectations clear, I\u2019m sure she knows how you parent versus her, it\u2019s not your fault and no it is not a big deal. \n\nIf this relationship is serious this needs to be resolved as your first big co-parenting issue before moving in together.", "NTA for the skirt because you didn\u2019t know but you are the asshole for telling your girlfriend she\u2019s overreacting and not apologizing. It\u2019s not your kid and she wasn\u2019t asking for your opinion. Say it was accident but that you will obey her wishes for HER kid in the future.

I saw your responses that the issue of the dress wasn't discussed ahead of time.   \n\n\nSo now what? It's time to talk to your girlfriend about these kind of things so that both of you know how the other wants their child treated or raised. Your relationship is new, so while your girlfriend is annoyed at how her daughter dressed, she should not be taking it out on you as she probably knew your laid back parenting style. Her daughter is safe, she didn't drink, she had a fun time at a party with older teens and with her new friend (your daughter) and seemed to have done well.   \n\n\nGoing forward as these teens grow up these kind of situations are going to arise, of conflict between the parent's wishes and those of the daughter(s). My guess is that Ms. F15 knew that her mom would not approve, so she did this behind Mom's back. Any parent knows that they must avoid being played off against the other, and as a step-parent you've just been played a little.

Seems like she's mad at her kid and taking it out on you.\n\nAlso I honestly wouldn't take much of what is said in the comments to heart.

I do think if you know how you\u2019re girlfriend is (controlling/old school) you should have her give more explicit rules or instructions if you are going to be watching her daughter to try and avoid this in the future.
