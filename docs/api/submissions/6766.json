It's not uncommon for a guy dating a mom to try to try to establish a good relationships with the kids, and getting a second set of flowers for the daughter when he's getting some for mom is a simple gesture.", "YTA. He bought your ex flowers and also for your daughter. He\u2019s being nice. Buying flowers is so far from grooming.  Good lord.", "INFO: why did you daughter feel the need to lie about where the flowers came from? Do you have any reason to believe your daughter is being groomed? Have you had a discussion with your daughter about appropriate and inappropriate touch/not keeping secrets/etc? Have you had issues with your ex\u2019s boyfriend in the past or have said things about him to your ex or daughter? You said \u201ckids\u201d, were there another children he did not get flowers for that makes you think he is singling her out? What were the flowers for? I know it\u2019s a lot of questions but context is important.", "YTA for automatically assuming there was malicious intent behind your daughter receiving flowers. Dear God.", "YTA- I would focus more on having a conversation with your daughter about why she feels it is unsafe to tell you the truth. Affirming to her that it's okay to be honest with you will be what keeps your connection strong. Her desire to lie is usually rooted in fear which means she likely has subconscious concerns about your reactions.\n\nYou didn't say how long the BF and mom have been together. A lot of times, a new partner is trying to win a child over-it isn't always grooming. It's hard to give up control when it comes to watching a former partner date. Focus less on the flowers and more on being a safe, non-reactive dad to your kiddo. Texting your ex asking \"why\" just stirs the pot for a situation that already happened.", "YTA.  As long as he is appropriate, kind and welcomes your daughter in his life, you should be happy she has another person in her life who treats her well.  We went through the jealous BS of false accusations and ugliness that ruined someone's childhood and they are still severely damaged into their middle aged years.  I always wished any of my ex-spouse's partners would like, love or be kind to my child.  None ever did.  Sad.", "Ummm yeah. YTA \nHe was probably just trying to do something nice for your ex and wanted your daughter to feel included", "INFO\n\nHas the boyfriend shown any other concerning behavior? Are you asking your daughter a lot of questions about what goes on in her mom's life? \n\nOn the face of it, what the guy did is sweet. But it concerns me that your daughter felt the need to lie to you about it. If he didn't tell her to keep it secret (and why would he and then tell your wife?) then either your ex thought it would be an issue and said, 'let's keep this fro dad' (but again, why would she leave the flowers out for you to see?) or you are spending too much time interrogating your daughter about what goes on in her mom's life. \n\nIs it possible that you've put your daughter under so much stress from the questions you ask, she felt the need to protect herself/her mother from your anger/disappointment?", "YTA. Who jumps straight to grooming suspicions? It\u2019s pretty clear he probably was buying flowers for her mom & decided to make your daughter feel special & included.

Not because he was trying to anything inappropriate.", "I guess it's pretty clear why you are her EX-husband.\n\nYTA", "YTA he's just being nice to your daughter. I'm not saying that you should not be aware of the possibility of those type of issues but all you have right now is that he bought her flowers. That's not enough to assume that he's grooming your child. I understand that as a parent you should be on the look out for those things but you went from 0 to 100 very quickly.", "NAH\u2026 with some things to consider:\n\nYou are a father and father\u2019s are naturally protective. I get that. However, this person might be an important person in your daughter\u2019s life for a long time. Starting with this suspicion may not bode well if you and him have to have a relationship of your own for the sake of co-parenting.\n\nIt should give you pause that your daughter felt she had to lie to you, possibly because she knew you would react this way. She should be able to tell you anything.\n\nThis man is likely trying to build a healthy relationship with your daughter. One of the ways girls learn how to be treated well by future love interests is by being doted on and respected by their father figures. \n\nHave you really never seen a father bring flowers for their daughter to school performances? Graduations? Daddy-daughter dates? It\u2019s not terribly uncommon.\n\nWhile yes, there are some people who do this for nefarious reasons, there are more who do it with pure intentions.", "OP, if you had a girlfriend who bought your 9 year old daughter flowers and your ex wife came to you with the same accusations, how would you react? The flowers weren't just for her either, he probably just picked them up when he was getting some for his girlfriend as a nice gesture. Calm down. YTA.", "Flowers themselves are usually just a nice gesture you bring to someone for welcoming you into their home. Sounds like he wants to make a good impression. This in itself is not an indication of predatory behavior, but dad may be a little jealous, esp if this means he wasn\u2019t the first to buy her some. Sounds like daughter was worried about dad\u2019s feelings and reaction. It\u2019s ok to feel your feelings just don\u2019t let them impact your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA not jumping to the worst possible conclusion, I would have thought that the boyfriend was trying to make good impression and since bringing your ex flowers he thought it would be cute and sweet to do the same for the daughter. He did it for brownie points I\u2019m sure, nothing creepy.", "YTA. Not in like a bad way AH but he was probably just being nice to his girlfriend's daughter. Later on down the line if you start to notice weird things going on then you have a right to worry. But I'm sure he was just being nice and showing that he cares for her (as a daughter for clarification).", "YTA. Buying flowers for your wife's child is common. It's a way to show that you won't take their mother away from them and that you promise to pay attention to them.", "Wooooooooow.\n\nAnd you even let these thoughts come out into the open, too.\n\nAND you\u2019re asking internet strangers to validate your absolute insanity.\n\nYTA, in case you didn\u2019t pick up on the context.", "I hear your concerns, as there are men who specifically target single women with young children so they can groom those children. But that of course doesn\u2019t mean every man does that, or that that is what\u2019s happening here.\n\nThe main concern here is that your daughter felt the need to lie to you. I saw you say before that you always encouraged your daughter to tell you if any of her mom\u2019s boyfriends is inappropriate to her, and it\u2019s good that you give her that open avenue. But I think you may want to examine how you may have come across at times, as it now seems like she thinks you\u2019ll be unduly suspicious of any man that does a nice gesture for her.\n\nMaking yourself a safe person for her to be honest with means that you give her support when she has negative experiences *and* positive experiences. Simply being gifted flowers is innocent and not a cause for concern, and the fact that you immediately jumped to it being inappropriate shows that you may have overreacted to simple gestures in the past, which might make her feel *less* able to be honest with you.\n\nYou sound very protective and definitely well-meaning. But in your overprotectiveness, you actually made your daughter more closed off. Try to fix that now while the lies are small, and temper your fears. I\u2019m gonna give you a YTA for this one, but you\u2019re not a bad person. You just need to adjust your suspicions so your daughter can trust you enough to be honest again.", "YTA - that\u2019s a kind thing for someone to do for their partner\u2019s kid.", "YTA. Sounds like you are looking for reasons to give your ex shit. Also that's not grooming man, come on. Nice gesture from him, unwarranted over the top response from you.", "YTA. It\u2019s ok to be suspicious, but buying her flowers isn\u2019t anything to jump the gun about. He\u2019s snowing a little girl that she is also important and cared about and deserves to be treated well.", "Unless you have seen indications of this, it is most likely him trying to be nice.  My Mom's boyfriend did things like this for my sister and me - and believe me, Andy had absolutely no interest in us.  \\*note: he had done this for his wife & daughter too.", "NAH. Honestly, you\u2019re not an AH for being concerned for your daughter. The mom\u2019s BF is not an AH for trying to make your daughter feel included. The lie is a little sus, though, ngl. Your ex isn\u2019t the AH for being offended, either. \n\nI would recommend you and the ex sit the daughter down for a talk about being safe and not keeping secrets, but it is important that it NOT be about the BF. It\u2019s about arming your daughter with the info she needs to keep her safe, and you and the ex need to be in the same page.\n\nEdit; on the same page", "NAH but red flag your daughters go to reaction was to lie. Dig into that, sounds like she may know to acts certain way with you because she knows you over react. Or, there really is something to be worried about and she knows it. Dig into treason for the lie not the flowers themselves.", "YTA. I\u2019m sure it is not only harmless, but very sweet to think of her while mom is getting flowers. That is not grooming.", "NAH. From another parent, I understand the instinct to be protective. The statistics about girls who are sexually abused by step fathers and mother's boyfriends is so depressing. It's between 1 in 6 and 1 in 7. So you are right to have this as a concern in general. An ounce of prevention and all that. The fact that she lied to you isn't great, so I understand why your hackles were raised. Asking a question to your co-parent isn't out of line. \n\nThe most important take away here is that it sounds like you're doing the right thing by having direct conversations with your daughter about what is appropriate and not, and you're looking out for signs of inappropriate behavior. Just be careful that you don't go too far overboard with warnings to her so that your daughter doesn't feel anxious about bringing up perfectly normal things in fear of provoking an overreaction from you.", "Hard hard hard YTA\u2026 This is freaking ridiculous.", "YTA dude, they\u2019re flowers.", "YTA\n\nyou should count yourself lucky your ex wife found someone man enough to take care of another man's kid. You seem to be the issue here", "YTA, giving flowers is harmless, and maybe this man is trying to show your 9yr old that she deserves flowers no matter any occasion. He\u2019s showing her that a girl deserves flowers and you should be happy someone is giving your little girl attention that maybe you can learn from. You turning something innocent into something with maliciousness makes you an AH.", "YTA.  You don't have custody, you don't have any context, you left your daughter in a terrible position with a divorce, and someone is nice to her and you chastise it.  smh.", "INFO: do you have any sense of WHY he bought flowers?\n\nLike, did he give flowers to all the women in his life for new years, is it a birthday, was there any particular event that would make flowers a thoughtful gift...?\n\nYour daughter lying about the source sets off alarm bells. That is the bit, for me, that changed my mind from \"it's probably just a nice gesture\" to \"oh shit.\" But try to take it easy with your daughter and keep an eye on how she's doing, because it seems she's concerned about your reactions.", "YTA, unless you have any indication of him being a creep. \n\nI think it\u2019s great her partner bought her flowers and I wish more men would do that for their daughter/partners daughters.\n\nETA, why did she feel the need to lie about who the flowers were from. Did you give any indication (verbal or otherwise) that you thought it was weird?", "Wtf? This is such a twisted interpretation of something very sweet. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because my father always bought me flowers when he got them for my mom, and it always meant the world to me. I think this is a wonderful way to show your daughter (and your ex) that he knows they\u2019re a package deal.\n\nYTA. You massively overreacted with no grounds for such horrible accusations. This is a great way to destroy that good relationship you have with your ex.", "YTA\n\nYou are slightly the AH. But you are being a good concerned dad. I say a slight AH only for immediately assuming the worst and going to grooming. Now you are being a good dad because you are asking where they came from. To me, it\u2019s a bit concerning she lied about it to start. That is something that happens when inappropriate relationships happen. Having said that, there is more chances of it being an innocent gift of flowers, than him grooming her. She is your daughter, and I assume all you want to do is protect her, just tell her she can always tell you the truth, no matter what it is.", "NTA - I\u2019ll probably get downvoted for this, but I truly believe you had your daughter\u2019s safety in mind when you made the inquiry. The fact that your daughter danced around a straight answer about them is fishy to me too. I can absolutely see this boyfriend doing it out of a sweet gesture too so your daughter is included. You brought up your concern and your ex-wife is aware. If there are any red flags trust her to see them and deal with them.", "I\u2019m going with NAH (As long as you didn\u2019t explode or bring your daughter into it directly). While i get your concern, there has been more and more cases of potential step parents trying to make the kids feel loved too. I don\u2019t think its necessarily a bad thing and as long as there arent other red flags, he\u2019s probably just trying to make sure she feels included and earn brownie points with your ex.", "NAH\n\nGrooming is a legitimate concern but the more likely explanation is he wants her to like him and feel included. My mom's boyfriends would often give us gifts on Valentine's Day or her birthday too without any funny stuff", "NAH. It's concerning that your daughter lied to you but it's fine that you're questioning why the BF is buying her flowers; makes sense that a new relationship would want to make points with the daughter since the son can't be bothered. I would pay attention to the situation and ask more questions if there's anything that seems suspicious or if your daughter continues lying.", "Sounds alot like your daughter and ex are afraid to lie to you?\n\nThis is the real concern here. Your villifying this man just becuase you resent him.\n\nYTA and I hope your daughter and ex are safe - from YOU.", "NTA.  Nice gesture or not, most CSA is committed by people the children know.  There are other nice gestures he can make that don't have romantic connotations if he wants her to like him as a potential step-parent.  You are wise to worry.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m with those that think it\u2019s weird due to the fact there are men who groom both the mom & kid into thinking certain things are ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Period.", "NAH.  It\u2019s sweet that when the boyfriend bought flowers for your ex they did so for her daughter as well.  People love getting flowers, especially little girls.  While it\u2019s unfair to jump to conclusions about people and assume bad intentions, you are also a dad.  I get being overly cautious and worried about your kid.  The world is a dangerous place and only getting worse.", "Soft YTA. I understand your instinct to protect.  It\u2019s good to be vigilant, and I don\u2019t fault you for that.  I do fault you for the way you handled it by just concluding the gift was inappropriate and telling your ex it was weird and inappropriate.  You do sound jealous! \n\nCould it have been grooming? Sure.  That gesture doesn\u2019t give me any red flags, but sure. Could it have been just a thoughtful gesture from a thoughtful boyfriend that will be another good man in your daughter\u2019s life - one who shows her how she should be treated? Yes.

I do think that unless you've been given any truly red flags about how the BF relates to your daughter, you might just have overreacted.\n\nIf the relationship is new, this is likely just an effort to make a good impression on the kids. A lot of folks, when they meet their SO's kids, will bring a little toy, treat, or something to make them feel valued as well.\n\nI'm moderately concerned that she lied to you about the source of the gift; if she has a habit of honesty with you and this is new behavior, the lie is worth exploring. I don't know how you ask her \"why\" without her feeling as if she's in the wrong (don't get me wrong, lying is bad, but in this case the source of the lie is more important IMO). If you're chill about your ex's dating life and speak respectfully of her new partner, you might need to explore how you're being spoken if in your ex's home. I don't want to villainize anyone at all, but if she was told to tell you that they're from \"mommy's friend\" you should sort out why she's being coached in deception.", "YTA my dad used to buy me flowers sometimes.

Having her moms new boyfriend around may be stirring up mixed emotions. For example, kids may feel they are betraying one parent by liking the other parents new partner. Especially if that parent has expressed distaste for the new partner in some way. Kids may try to not talk about positive things about the new partner to avoid a negative response from the other parent. Kids are hyper aware of these things. Your daughter lying, your son not liking his mom dating, and h your ex responding that you were just jealous makes me wonder if you have in fact made it known you do not like your ex\u2019s boyfriends, the fact she\u2019s dating, or the new men in your kids\u2019 lives.

I think of my father when I see snapdragons, and calla lillies. And I love sweet peas. \n\nIt's a little thing, but a great thing, to share with a loved one.", "NTA (at least, not 100% YTA) for being humble enough to see the other side.", "I don't have a strong vote, here. My first response was yes--unless there is something else to suggest this might be grooming behavior. So, I have no vote on your question about the flowers.\n\nBut, I'm the daughter of overprotective parents--to the degree that to this day I can't even pretend to see how some of the logic worked other than it was an anxiety or yrauma response on behalf of my mother (and dad mostly went along). \n\nI'm concerned about this for you and your daughter. It is not uncommon for such kids to rebel and get in trouble because they push beyond the boundaries where they might need your protection. They learn to lie about all kinds of things because they were first pushed, in their minds, into having to tell the truth about something that doesn't even matter in order to appease the parent or to lie and just move forward. They lie because it is a clear overreaction on the part of the parent. From there,  the lying becomes easier overall. \n\nI tend to not lie, much to the dismay of the world that prefers white lies to direct, honest answers.i did, though, grow up lying to my parents-- and probably not in the way that kids just sometimes lie to parents. I'm in my 50s and mom still asks questing that dig in and feel like that overprotective parent: I still lie to her and about things that don't matter. It mostly just makes it tolerable.\n\nAside from the lying, I chose the furthest in-state college as I could. I took nearly every single thing I owned with me (think fitting a uhaul into a dorm room). I couldn't stand to be near them, particularly my mother who was illogicaly overprotective. I met someone in college, got married, and now I live about 1000 miles away--and didn't move home when I got divorced. I didn't purposefully do that; however, had the relationships been different, being close to them may have been a higher priority on the decision-making list. My mother takes emotional energy, so the few times I've thought about moving there,  I looked for jobs about 2 hours away--not right there. \n\nI haven't and don't have an emotional relationship with my parents. I love them and know they love me. We have a dutiful relationship. I'd like a better relationship, and I know I've hurt my mother by rebuffing her so many times. I'm deeply sorrowful about that. It hurts me, too, but in the end, I'm protecting my mental health and relationship, really. If I were geographically closer,  I might not have this current level of relationship.\n\nExample from when I was 16: mom's rule--no boys in my car\n\nSeems to make sense at first. But this was a kind of compulsive response to keep me safe. I don't know how to explain how I know. There is just a difference in tension and drive in some rules versus others.\n\nThe rest of the rule: the boy has to drive\n\nWTF.\n\nI lied. Unless I was in a longer relationship,  I drove the boys and I lied. Why? Because I wasn't going to be in a boy's car when he stopped it on the side of the road and said it wouldn't start and then tried to get up on me (which happened under their rules). I'm driving.  I have the keys,  and I can stop the car and get out (okay, this was before cell phones and my 16-year old brain didn't think about him having a weapon, though I only had people in the car I knew or were with friends of my friends. As others have pointed out, though,  most assaults are by someone you know).  \n\nI knew my mom's rule was anxiety driven (though influenced by sexism) even at that age before that incident happened. At first I ignored and lied mostly just rules that seemed illogical and anxiety driven. Then I ignored and lied about it if I could get away with it. I'm not allowed to take the car anywhere but work and friends' houses and predetermined places.  We were in the city (lived in the suburbs), the theme park,  the beach (another state over)--well, until dad started tracking my miles. Had the lying not already started,  I'm not sure I would've been someone who led a group of us going all over. The thing is, I'm not like that in any other area of my life. If I'm going to be late for work, I send a message. I'm the first one there. Almost never would anyone ever know! \n\nPlease don't jeopardize your daughter or your current and future relationships. Figure out what is driving the overprotectiveness. If it is your anxiety,  own and deal with your own anxiety. If it based on your own past behavior, own that--and arm your daughter with good decision-making, high self-esteem, and smart behaviors. Keep on a level of honesty.  She's already lying.  \n\nPlease take the advice of the redditor we're replying to.", "Congrats, shes gonna lie to you more often since she knows you overreact and prob wont trust her as she gets older.

Sure, typically a predator will show clear preference to giving gifts to the target child and not others in the household, but they don\u2019t always follow this method. The goal is to make the child feel more \u201cadult,\u201d and that can be done by sending signals that they may hold a similar status in the predator\u2019s eyes as the actual adult romantic partner.)\n\nPredators are individuals too.

You could have just taken that information and pocketed it away, making your observation. You have no other evidence of ill intent or abuse taking place.\n\nOne important factor in preventing CSA is educating your children and providing them with the knowledge and language they need to identify it, and the safe space to talk to a trusted adult about it. Does your daughter know the correct anatomical names of her reproductive organs? Does she have any concept of sex and how her body works? Does she have any concept of consent and appropriate and inappropriate touching and other behaviours? These conversations are not a \"one and done\", you can't just \"have the talk\" and be done with it. It must be continuous and age-appropriate. There are tons of books out there to help parents have those conversations and introduce children to those concepts in age-appropriate ways so it doesn't have to be awkward.\n\nIf I were you I would not bring up the flowers again and then apologise to your daughter, your ex and her boyfriend, and the three of you adults need to find ways to co-parent together with open lines of communication.\n\nBest of luck.", "Ugh yes YTA - The BF bought flowers for his GF and out of respect, also bought flowers for his GFs daughter.

Is that why you think she's dating a pervert?\n\nDon't grill your kids for dirt on their Mom's boyfriend. Don't make your daughter so nervous she needs to lie \n\nAnd buy your daughter some flowers too. You made a cheerful gift feel bad to her", "NTA. Better safe than sorry.

It seems pretty apparent that she initially hid the origin because she would be concerned about what you think about it.  Not because some man gave her flowers, she was ready and willing to own up to that, but because the man who's slowly taking your place did.  You need to assure her that you are NOT jealous of Mom's new boyfriend and that she never has to hide the fact that he's a big part of her mom's life, and hers now as well too.  And yes, obviously, if anyone ever does anything inappropriate or that makes her uncomfortable, she absolutely needs to tell another trusted adult about it.  It seems pretty obvious that Mom is well aware of the flower gift... after all, both vases are sitting side by side, so it's not like this is some hidden \"our little secret\" kind of thing.\n\nAlso, if it sets your mind at ease, if personal experience is anything to go by, somewhere around 13, she will suddenly start hating him and remind him frequently that he's \"not her real dad\".

The only advice I'd give to you is don't jump to conclusions or bring anything up unless there are other signs of something not right. You know your kids best and if they start acting out of the norm then definitely talk to them about if there's something going on.

But to openly create conflict, and involve your 9 year old, over something so trivial just screams your insecurity and jealousy that your ex has moved on. \n\nChill out. YTA.", "Very valid concern. A 9 year old girl doesn\u2019t need flowers from her mom\u2019s boyfriend. Too soon and too much! Also concerning that the child lied about it.\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nI get that as a parent you are sensitive to child grooming topics but buying flowers/chocolates/plushies is simply a very thoughtful, nice thing to do, you might automatically assume flowers with romantic gestures but srsl they are not.\n\nWhen my sister was dating, her bf bought me a plushie (I was 5) when he visited us at home. You can take it as him trying to score points with the family, him being nice, or to think he's been grooming me. Let me tell you at once: he was simply a nice guy.\n\nMy sister's other bf used to buy me (and later on also his daughter) flowers/roses for \"Women Day\" holiday so that we feel included, it was also a normal thing to do (I was 10 - 16 yo).\n\nYour daughter lied to you? Kind of concerning but I bet that she saw your facial expression/tone of voice or expected your reaction, not because she felt it was wrong to get flowers.\n\nYou could have asked her, calmly, what she thought of getting flowers, what she felt when she got them, whether she was happy, if she would like to get them in the future. \nEven if she was unhappy, it could be because she simply doesn't like flowers and wished it was chocolate xD\n\nAnyways, there are a lot of details missing, context, and basing grooming accusation only on flowers from mother's bf is more than a huge leap in logic. Saying bad things about bf/accussing him directly or indirectly based on flower incident? Absurd unless you've got proof.\n\nIf you're still concerned, keep an eye on them but for the love of all holy, don't push your assumptions on your daughter and don't \"poison her\" against the bf, even with good intentions.", "NTA sorry this is weird. Kids don\u2019t need fucking flowers. It\u2019s weird it just is.", "YTA\n\nThat was very considerate of him to get her flowers too! If your daughter is lying to you, perhaps you should take a long look why....Though your gross overreaction to a simple sweetness is kinda telling.", "YTA\n\nSo your ex wifes boyfriend bought his partner flowers, and bought his partners daughter flowers so she wouldnt feel left out. My step dad used to do this all the time, it was super sweet\n\nIf you always react this angrily to the smallest, most innocent of things, im not surprised your kid felt the need to lie...", "In itself there is nothing wrong with this.\n\nIf you had a step-daughter, wouldn't you buy her flowers? I sure would.\n\nWhy did your daughter lie? Did she spot your reaction and feel like she needed to \"quickly clarify\" so you wouldn't  get angry? In that case, you are the asshole, and she's learned to act that way from dealing with you in the past. You need to admit this to yourself and change your behaviour.\n\nIf she already had the feeling that the flowers were not appropriate, that would be because other inappropriate things had occurred. If you really suspect this is the case, talk to her in the GENERAL case about grooming and appropriate ways for adult men and young girls to relate, you need not refer to the boyfriend at all.", "YTA. It\u2019s a nice thing to do to include the daughter.", "YTA and i'm concerned how you treat your daughter that she felt the need to lie to you.", "Soft YTA as I'm sure it's coming from a well intentioned desire to keep your child safe.\n\nFlowers are a lovely and normal gift to give anyone at any time. It isn't a sign that your child is being groomed.", "YTA. How sweet of him to not only think about his girlfriend, but also his stepdaughter (to be).", "Bruh, YTA. If he had ONLY gotten flowers for your daughter, that would be understandably odd. But he had also bought some for mom. It could be a buy one get one and he thought she'd like them, or he JUST WANTED TO APPRECIATE THE GALS IN HIS LIFE WITH A LIL FLORAL CHEER. You're right to keep an eye out for funny business, but most likely there is no business here that is anything less than serious \ud83d\udc4d", "He is showing your daughter that she is an important person in his life alongside her mum. Sounds like you are looking for problems where there isn't any. It's very telling that you automatically think he is grooming.", "YTA\n\nHe did a sweet thing that shows her how happy blended relationships can work.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t sneaky. It wasn\u2019t inappropriate. She lied because she felt your vibe, not because she was told to or felt weird about it.\n\nShe felt weird and sensitive to YOU.", "Depends on who told the daughter to lie. Did the boyfriend? Thats sus. Your ex? She didn't want you throwing a tantrum. A lot of men buy flowers or chocolates or small gifts for female children in their lives. The goal is to teach the little girls not to tolerate the bare minimum from future partners. Same reasoning is given to daddy/daughter dates. Its not sexual. Its not creepy. Its just showing the little girl men who care will be nice.", "stay vigilant friend.\n\ngroomers come in all forms.  not all of them are dealing candies from trenchcoat pockets.  a psych friend of mine who deals with youth has told me some real horror stories, and they often come from within families.\n\nyou were right to question.  don't let a bunch of strangers on the internet gull you into being complacent, your daughter's well-being is bigger than the sum total of all of these opinions.", "YTA look here is how I see it. Firstly your daughter had to lie to you why? she got flowers and I think your jealous that you didn't give them to her. If the mom and daughter both got them on the same day explain to me why thats inappropriate. Not every man out there is bad and out to groom children give this person a chance and stop being jealous", "NAH. \nI understand your caution but you have to consider if you have given the impression you have a problem with her mum's date.", "YTA. Too much of a jump too quickly imo. It's not weird or inappropriate, but there is clearly a reason why your daughter didn't want to tell you who the flowers were from. This could be suspicious, but it could also be that it's really hard being a kid stuck in the middle of two adults and not knowing how to behave.", "YTA my fianc\u00e9 always buys my little girl flowers when he buys some for me because he wants her to feel special too, he also always buys my son football cards at the same time \n\nIt sounds like a healthy relationship tbh", "Could it be that.. the ex is the real father? You never know nowadays.", "My mum's partner when I was little used to buy my mum flowers and would also get me some too. \nWhenever he bought her something, he got me something. I remember valentines Day when I was like 8 he ordered flowers for my mum and a big Teddy to be delivered. Then, out of nowhere, a big bunch for me, and a card. He was just being nice and he loved my mum so he wanted us both to be happy. \n\nI understand as today in this world we hear so many horror stories. \n\nI just don't understand why your daughter lied to you when you asked her x", "YTA. He\u2019s being nice and included your daughter when he bought flowers. Not every action is suspicious.", "Assume positive intent but stay alert.", "Every Valentine's day, my dad came home with three roses, one big one for my mum, two little ones for my sister and me. I always thought it was very sweet.", "He probably also still wants to get the kids to like him. Giving a 9 year old girl flowers as you get her mum flowers is a very sweet way of showing you care about her.", "It is very sweet, thats an adorable and completely non predatory thing to do.", "The daughter likely realised her father would kick off, so she tried to say they were from someone other than her mother's boyfriend.", "I dunno, I lied about my stepdad for years. He always did really nice things for me, and of course I was expected to be grateful. He coached all my sports teams from 8-14, organized sleepovers, treated my mom amazingly, made sure we were well taken care of financially, volunteered in the community (even made the local paper a few times for his generosity and organizations!). Really, a great amazing guy, pillar of the community stuff. Went out of his way to give the shirt off his back to anyone who needed it. Any of my friends had parental trouble, they could stay with us, him and my mom were happy to open their house and talk them through it. Overall, a great guy who definitely bought me and my mom flowers and took us both out for dinner dates and got us nice jewelry.  \n\nThen again, he started molesting and eventually raping me around 12/13 and I never felt like I could tell anyone and was even defensive about anyone who got suspicious. It took getting knocked up at 16 (stepdads baby? my boyfriends baby? nobody knows because I had to give birth to a dead baby during the trial!) for me to finally snap and break my silence. \n\nNo one believed me except my mom. In fact, that whole town still thinks he's a great guy that I lied about because he treated me and my mom *so well*. He moved in with his new girlfriend and her 5 daughters (all under 16, of course) once he served his 8 months in prison, and they're all still so sure that he could never have done those things to me. \n\nI think about those girls all the time, and what they likely went through. It's a pretty easy Google search to see the stats on how likely a child of a single mom is to be sexually abused by a new partner, especially female children. Frankly I wish my bio dad had been there to have OPs reaction. Would have saved me a fucking *lifetime* of trauma. \n\nI'd rather people be suspicious of adults in positions of power around their children than do their best to brush it off like the majority here are doing.", "It seems OP didn't realise there is a WIBTA option, and edited the post to look like he had already done what he was considering to get advice.", "Exactly!  As a survivor of child SA, anything that wasn't consumables was things like books, jewelry and I was made a toy box with book shelves when I was four. I actually have vivid memories of the \"gifts\" being given.", "Kids 100% tip toe around parents who have a history of getting upset over what the other parent is doing. It\u2019s odd that you say we don\u2019t know the boyfriend or the dad yet immediately assume the daughter being evasive isn\u2019t due to the father. A bit contradictory.", "> She is no more likely to be victimized by mom's new boyfriend than she is by her father.\n\nType that into Google and report back with the result lmao \ud83d\ude02", "He didn\u2019t specifically get her flowers. He got her flowers because he was getting her mother some and wanted to include her. It\u2019s actually pretty common to include the child of someone you\u2019re dating when things are getting serious.", "It's a bird, it's a plane, it's...\n\nThe point! Aw, there it goes, ya missed it.", "Outside the norm for who? Who are these men who don't buy flowers anymore? Just say you don't buy flowers or  never received them and call it a day.", "And it\u2019s only \u201coutside the norm\u201d because AH like you and OP insinuate they\u2019re inappropriate predators", "Agreed. Unless the boyfriend has done other things that raise a red flag, he actually sounds like a decent, considerate guy. One of my fondest memories is of my dad coming home with a little bunch of violets for me for  my birthday, when I was about 10."]}
