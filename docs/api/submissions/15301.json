Is he just like this around food or is he like that all the time? \n\nI ask because I have a relative who is positively obnoxious when it comes to food. If she offers you something and you just had a big meal and you say, \"No thanks, I'm not hungry because I just ate a big meal\", she takes that as a personal challenge to get you to eat something. She will literally list every food item in her kitchen while you say no thank you; thanks, but no; i really did have a large meal, I'm not going to feel hungry for several hours; believe me, when I'm hungry, I'll be sure to let you know\", and so forth. One time I was having a conversation with someone when she interrupted led to ask if she could get me something to eat. I politely declined and went back to the conversation. She interrupted again to ask how about a sandwich. After the 4th or 5th interruption it was clear that the conversation was going to be at a standstill. I turned my attention to her and said, \"Ok, what have you got to eat?\" She fucking listed her entire inventory while I said no thanks, or still not hungry after every freaking item. It probably took 20 minutes. Then she  offered to go to the store and began listing things at the grocery store that she didn't have in her house. I finally asked for a small plate of olives just to get her to shut up. She didn't seem to notice that I didn't eat any of them. Since then, I always say yes even if I'm not hungry just to avoid going through all that with her ever again. I think in her case it's a family/cultural thing.\n\nI suggest saying yes to every question since your dad won't take a no, especially if it's food related. If he asks if you want a sandwich. You say \"yes, but I'm not hungry\". If he asks why you want a sandwich if you aren't hungry.
