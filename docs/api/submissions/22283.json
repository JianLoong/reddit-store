Not sexual harassment but definitely there\u2019s a lack of respect, general consideration and appropriate boundaries here. There was another option for him to use plus it was not an emergency. If you have to share you need to agree on how to share going forward. Otherwise I\u2019d be sending in my girlfriends to wash their hands next time he\u2019s in the shower, too. Or just use your parent\u2019s bathroom. Maybe then they will parent.", "NTA. Your dad should have helped as he's the parent. With no other assistance, I recommend getting a door wedge to put under the door so it doesn't matter if he has a master key he still can't come in. It was just petty of him to leave the door open. \n\nAnd he's perfectly capable of washing his hands elsewhere - he's just trying to needle you.", "What you\u2019re describing doesn\u2019t really sound appropriate. He can wash his hands in other sinks. At your age(s), some privacy in the bathroom is necessary. \nIf your father won\u2019t listen please keep talking to family members until you find one who can explain to your dad why this isn\u2019t appropriate. If you strike out, talk to a counselor at school and ask them to talk to your dad.\n\nNTA", "Buy a wedge door stop and use it when you shower.  Also,  notify bro that you are going to go use the bathroom for x minutes. Give him time to go wash his hands so he can't complain. \n\nNTA", "NTA and your dad is an A-hole for not telling your brother to lay off. Your brother is also an A-hole because he can wash his hands in the kitchen.", "NTA and this situation is extremely inappropriate and bordering on sexual harassment. Your brother is 15 and he is old enough to understand it is very wrong for him to be walking in on you when you\u2019re nude. \n\nYou have the right to privacy in the bathroom, whether it be from a sibling, a parent or anyone else. No one should be walking in on you intentionally when you are naked. \n\nPlease sit down with both your parents and explain that you need them to back you up and enforce that you have the right to privacy and safety in your own home. \n\nIt is wrong for your dad to brush this off as squabbling between siblings. Your brother is sexually harassing you, this is harmful and inappropriate behaviour that needs to be taken seriously and addressed.\n\nIf they don\u2019t support you, is there a trusted adult such as a teacher or relative you\u2019d feel ok going to?", "ESH. The bathroom has 2 doors, you're saying one of the doors sections off the shower from the rest of the bathroom but you opted to lock the main door instead of that door? Your brother was being a dick for sure, but his behaviour had a juvenile/immature point - that you don't need the whole bathroom. Not saying what he did was right. I seriously doubt he would ever unlock the second door while you're using the shower.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He didn't look at her in the shower, make any sexual comments, or touch her.", "She DID need the whole bathroom. NO ONE wants people walking in while they're showering, it's PRIVATE time. I'm almost thirty and I'm angry on this kids behalf. Of course she's gonna fucking lock the doors for privacy, she's a teenager. What a weird take", "Also wildly inappropriate. He\u2019s not 6.", "I agree she needs privacy, but that's the point of the inner door where the shower is. I grew up sharing a bathroom with my siblings and it can be very inconvenient when you can't get into your own bathroom for an hour while waiting your turn. If we had separate sections like this, I totally would only close the door to the shower so the rest of the bathroom was still accessible.\n\nI do however have a problem with the brother just letting himself in and leaving the doors open while she's showering. These siblings both need to learn to get along better and be more respectful of each other and the fact that it's shared space. The father should be helping to facilitate that. ESH", "I think you're confused. It's not a Jack and Jill bathroom with 2 entries. The way OP is describing it is that there is a main door and a secondary door. The main door has the sink and vanity, keep going further to the secondary door and there's the shower and toilet. If you close and lock the secondary door then everyone still has access to the sink and vanity while providing privacy to people using the shower and toilet. OP locked the main door so that she could have the window open  - there is no window in the area with the shower and toilet. The window is a preference and not a necessity, though I would hope a properly designed bathroom would have ventilation or an exhaust fan above the shower.", "Achsually, in our household no one cares.  Though our son starts wanting to be alone when he\u2018s getting ready for bed and we respect that, of course.", "But all that's in the \"main\" bit is a sink, I'm sure the kitchen has a sink.", "Which is probably where their toothbrush, face wash, brush, etc. are. My sister and I would occasionally knock and ask if we could grab those things if the other was showering when we needed them.", "I'm sure it was so vital for the brief time the bathroom was being used that he needed to brush his teeth. The brother is a prick here and OP is rightfully annoyed by this.", "She said he came upstairs right as she got in the shower. She had already been in there for 10 minutes when he knocked and told him she was going to be another 10 minutes. If I'm waiting to brush my teeth before bed, I would be annoyed waiting that long too. I totally agree the brother was a dick, but it doesn't sound like the OP was being considerate of her brother either.", "I agree that it\u2019s NTA, but it sounds like the bathroom has two rooms, and the shower is separate, so even though he washes his hands in one there isn\u2019t really a danger he could see her. It\u2019s more the blatant disrespect.", "Barged into a place where she was naked and didn\u2019t want him to be. Sexual harassment isn\u2019t alway sexual comments or physical contact. She said wait 10 min. He decided her consent to her privacy didn\u2019t matter\u2026 to wash his hands. Dick move yes, but when someone is naked and says no it\u2019s sexual harassment. Naked person is vulnerable. He did it to be more than a dick. He did it bc he could make her supremely uncomfortable and that\u2019s not just dick behavior. It\u2019s sexual harassment. Whether the intent was sexual it was still sexual harassment bc he KNEW she was naked and knew she didn\u2019t want him in there and he did it anyway.", "No. Please educate yourself on what sexual harassment is. No part of OPs post was sexual in any way. Check what you're saying to an impressionable young person (OP) before posting it. Are you trying to make OP believe she has been sexually violated by her brother? That is clearly untrue and there's zero evidence of this.\n\nThe brother invaded her privacy for sure but for all intents washed his hands and left. OP was naked in a shower - behind a screen. OP didn't see her brother. Brother did not see OP. Brother made no attempts to see OP naked or even talk to OP while they were in the bathroom at the same time.\n\nFor sure give your opinion, but don't post about it like it's a fact."]}
