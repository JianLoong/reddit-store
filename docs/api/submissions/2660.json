My son attends international school to ease his transition. His classes are in English but he has to follow national curriculum of our new country.\n\nHe\u2019s been struggling a lot because they have to learn a lot more subjects than he is used to.\n\nOne of the subjects he struggles with is math. He doesn\u2019t get to choose whether he wants algebra or trigonometry, he must take math and they\u2019ll cover all parts of it. Kids are also far ahead of him. Things he\u2019s learned at school last year, they covered 2 years prior. It\u2019s been a struggle. He was offered to attend a lower grade to help catch him up but we refused\n\nNow, here\u2019s the issue, his teacher doesn\u2019t give them homework. She said that they cover topics and excel uses in classes and then, they have their worksheet in the book. She told them, it\u2019s optional but if they want to do well, they should do them to practice what they\u2019ve learned.\n\nMy son, Nathaniel (Nate) saw this as no homework and haven\u2019t been doing it sati there\u2019s no homework and it\u2019s not graded. As a result he\u2019s been failing his tests.\n\nI see the issue and went to the teacher asking her to give them homework to help him structure his study better and to grade it so he can get some good grades to help with his final grade.\n\nShe refused and said that the goal was to teach kids how to study independently, that some kids will only need to do 5 equations while others will need 25 and she wasn\u2019t going to force kids to do it if they don\u2019t need it. She said she wasn\u2019t going to grade homework because tests are enough to understand were the students are with their abilities.\n\nI told her that she was being dismissive and called her unprofessional and bad at her job.\n\nShe told me to leave. I was furious, it was disrespectful and dismissive. I went straight to her superiors and reported her. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and nothing has been done. I feel completely dismissed and vented to one of my new friends and they told me I was entitled and an asshole and I\u2019ll admit, I am completely shocked. I thought they would be on my side. \n\nAm I really an asshole here?", "created_utc": 1668797504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyriv3/aita_for_demanding_my_sons_teacher_starts_giving/", "score": 822, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The teacher's behaviour does not seem out of line at all, particularly with the culture taken into account.", "YTA \n\nYou either should have put him in the lower grade so he could catch up or you need to teach him how to do his own studying and practice.", "YTA.

Not that it matters, you just reek of American entitlement. 100% YTA. \nBe accountable for your child's education. Swallow your pride and place him in a lower grade so he can catch up.

European schools are advanced compared to USA. One big reason is schools don't spoon-feed the students. It is your responsibility to get your kid to learn on his own. Did you do no research on this before you went? You are none too bright.", "YTA. If your son needs help HELP HIM YOURSELF. You blatantly wrote that your son decided because it wasn't graded then he wouldn't do it and that's his choice for failing not the teachers. You need to give him homework YOURSELF and make sure he does it. The teacher has dozens of children to worry about so buckle up and focus on your ONE.", "YTA. You could just make sure your son is doing the workbook problems at home, why does the teacher have to be involved? Also if your son is at such a lower level than the other students, why not transfer him to another grade as recommended? You\u2019re acting as though the problem is anything but the student who does not take the time to study for his classes.", "YTA!  Your son\u2019s teacher sounds like she expects her students to be independent learners and capable of understanding that if a student needs help or practice outside of class, it\u2019s up to them to find the help or do the worksheets.  You are the one who was disrespectful and rude and you need to hold your son accountable for his lazy attitude.  The school offered you the option for your son to drop down a year but you decided the teacher needed to change the way she teaches rather than do what would have been best for your son.", "YTA. Many schools don't assign homework. The theory being adults aren't supposed to take home work with them kids shouldn't either. If your son is struggling, you either need to move him to the lower class or get him a tutor. The other students shouldn't be forced to do homework because your kid can't figure it out.", "YTA. If you\u2019re concerned with his progress and feel he needs homework, why are you not taking it upon yourself to study with him or making homework for him to do? You refused their offer of starting in a lower grade, and now he\u2019s suffering for it. The teacher does not need extra work or anyone telling her how to do her job when they\u2019re not stepping in at home.", "YTA\n\nYou are the parent. Parent your kid. Make him do the worksheets and get him a tutor.", "YTA\n\n> He was offered to attend a lower grade to help catch him up but we refused\n\nHe needs to be in a grade that is closer to his current education level or significant additional tutoring. Frankly I think you set your own kid up for failure here.\n\n> I see the issue and went to the teacher asking her to give them homework to help him structure his study better and to grade it so he can get some good grades to help with his final grade.\n\nhe\u2019s 14, not 7. The issue is your son isn\u2019t putting in the extra work - not her teaching.\n\nLearning to manage your own time and study if you need it is a pretty important skill, and now is the time to develop it instead of in college or on the job. (You could also very easily check your son\u2019s homework. Sending a kid to school doesn\u2019t mean you get to check out of being involved in their education.)\n\nAlso doing the homework might not even help much, if he\u2019s that far behind I imagine he\u2019s getting stuck and can\u2019t complete the problems. YOU didn\u2019t set up your son for success and now you\u2019re trying to blame the teacher.\n\nThere\u2019s another element at play here - failure can be the best lesson when it is the consequences of your own choices. And failing in HS really has no long term ramifications for most folks.\n\nI think you deserved to be dismissed - I also think you are confusing dismissal with disagreement. The teacher does not need to take your directive to give every student more mandatory work because your child won\u2019t do the worksheets.\n\nBeing professional doesn\u2019t mean being a doormat, and it sounds like you have no basis to judge her teaching ability - remember, you declined putting your son in the appropriate grade. \n\nI agree with your new friend.", "YTA\n\nI mean, of course. I think deep down you realize this which is why you made the post. The solution to this problem is extremely simple, if you want your son to be doing extra homework then you can take a few minutes to find extra homework and assign it to him yourself. I'm curious about what you reported that teacher for because it doesn't sound like the teacher did anything wrong based on the information you provided in this post. \n\nTLDR: I agree with the teacher and you should strongly consider making the non-mandatory worksheets the teacher provided mandatory for your child. Otherwise finding additional homework to assign to your son is firmly on your shoulders. Also, don't forget about tutoring!", "> He was offered to attend a lower grade to help catch him up but we refused\n\nYTA I guess? If the years don't map 1:1 why not? At 14 he _should be_ responsible enough to go above and beyond to try to learn outside the classroom if that is what's needed to keep up; they're not going to keep spoon-feeding him.", "YTA parent your son, don't expect the school to. Thank God Europe actually values their teachers and didn't bend to your hissy fit.", "YTA\n\nEducation is a collaborative effort. The teacher is not the only one responsible for getting your kid to learn math. You need to do your bit too. That means standing over him to ensure he does the assigned worksheets, practicing with him if he\u2019s struggling, even getting him a tutor. You fucked up when you refused to put him in a lower grade. Clearly the new country is more advanced in their education than your home country. Your fault for not doing something to ensure your kid wasn\u2019t going to fall behind.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds as if the teacher is following the standard procedure in her country.  You want   \n the teacher to tailor the classroom instruction to suit your desires for your child.  I bet that's not even done in your home country.\n\nPerhaps you should have accepted their school's offer to put your son in a different grade that was more suitable to his current skill level rather than leaving him in an advanced class and letting him flounder.

My son attends international school to ease his transition. His classes are in English but he has to follow national curriculum of our new country.\n\nHe\u2019s been struggling a lot because they have to learn a lot more subjects than he is used to.\n\nOne of the subjects he struggles with is math. He doesn\u2019t get to choose whether he wants algebra or trigonometry, he must take math and they\u2019ll cover all parts of it. Kids are also far ahead of him. Things he\u2019s learned at school last year, they covered 2 years prior. It\u2019s been a struggle. He was offered to attend a lower grade to help catch him up but we refused\n\nNow, here\u2019s the issue, his teacher doesn\u2019t give them homework. She said that they cover topics and excel uses in classes and then, they have their worksheet in the book. She told them, it\u2019s optional but if they want to do well, they should do them to practice what they\u2019ve learned.\n\nMy son, Nathaniel (Nate) saw this as no homework and haven\u2019t been doing it sati there\u2019s no homework and it\u2019s not graded. As a result he\u2019s been failing his tests.\n\nI see the issue and went to the teacher asking her to give them homework to help him structure his study better and to grade it so he can get some good grades to help with his final grade.\n\nShe refused and said that the goal was to teach kids how to study independently, that some kids will only need to do 5 equations while others will need 25 and she wasn\u2019t going to force kids to do it if they don\u2019t need it. She said she wasn\u2019t going to grade homework because tests are enough to understand were the students are with their abilities.\n\nI told her that she was being dismissive and called her unprofessional and bad at her job.\n\nShe told me to leave. I was furious, it was disrespectful and dismissive. I went straight to her superiors and reported her. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and nothing has been done. I feel completely dismissed and vented to one of my new friends and they told me I was entitled and an asshole and I\u2019ll admit, I am completely shocked. I thought they would be on my side. \n\nAm I really an asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There's nothing inherently wrong with that-- the trades are much more highly respected and don't require quite the rigor in the core educational classes. Either the son has to decide they want to be educated or they're not going to be.\n\nFinally, teachers take their jobs seriously, and are more highly respected in Europe. Although public schools get the best teachers, the international school teachers are going to generally be very good at their job and know what to do better than any parents second-guessing them could advise.

For example math!\u201d Lol pretty sure most countries have reading and math as staples of their curriculum so I\u2019m not sure why she thought math as an example. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sure this move wasn\u2019t a last minute decision and even if it was did OP do no research on the school system in her family\u2019s new country? Didn\u2019t look up the international school\u2019s curriculum and expectations? Or did she just expect it to be just like the US? Or based on this post did she expect it to bend over backwards to help her son.\n\nThis is on OP not helping her son catch up. Why is it all on the teachers to make her son catch up and change their classroom style to fit one student\u2019s needs? OP needs to get her son a tutor and start making him do the worksheets.", "Do they really? That's mad! I have discalcula so numbers are not my forte, but how the frack would you remember anything from a year or more ago as a teen? Barmey!", "I'm American as well. 60% of us don't act like this,  but the 40% is loud and wrong with the adult tantrum entitlement. Also, our general lack of respect for educators is appalling. I blame \"the customer is always right\" attitude that somehow leaked into other aspects of society.", "Same.", "As an American teacher fuck the OP. This is why people are leaving education. Why deal with a parent like this when I can make more literally anywhere?", "Ditto!!", "And combining punishment with education will only make him fall further behind. Gotta kid is doing this work in another language, he deserves some grace and appreciation", "Oh I absolutely agree with you! Coming from one country to another I can see her being upset that the schooling was different BUT research should have been done beforehand. At the end of the day the curriculum is what it is and it is the responsibility of the parent to check behind their child.", "Yep. That's what I think (about the school's admin). International School means private expensive good quality school. I don't know where in Europe they're located, but in general here we don't take kindly to parents trying to impose to the school methodology (unless I don't know, the parents are from a Royal family, when maybe some accommodation could be made). \n\nI mean, their rates are so high because they are elite, not only in terms of who goes there, but also academically. \n\nAnyway, this is a good example of entitlement, I'll say.", "Except that what your saying is the opposite of what the No Child Left behind legislation said. NCLB brought with it high stakes testing, and in some places grade promotion contingent on standardized test scores. It in no way said that no student should be left behind in the prior grade when failing. As good as the slogan or the law may have sounded, this tough love approach to schooling is not effective. Research shows that students who are socially promoted and provided learning supports do better long term than students who are held back a grade. \n\nThat being said, it still may have been prudent to put him in the lower grade. When transferring to a school in a different country it\u2019s important to remember that each country\u2019s curriculum is different. Grade 1 might start at age 5, 6, or 7. The start of formal reading instruction can begin anywhere between ages 4 and 8. And the order in which topics are taught in math and science might be flipped or accelerated compared to another country. So 14 year olds in one country don\u2019t have the same background knowledge as those in the next, and might be more accelerated in one subject but behind in another. \n\nWhen placing a child in a foreign school you can\u2019t just look at grade number or birthdate, you must also consider what portions of the curriculum they have already studied.", "Holding a kid back is more complicated than that.  For example I had a student who was held back a year but she was in special education.  The only reason she was held back was because her parents insisted.  As a special education teacher it is my job to teach where the kid is at, not necessarily the grade level.  The only thing holding her back did was stunt her social development.   There are a lot of downsides to holding kids back.", "Did you miss the part where the school offered to do so?", "Nope. We find it important to be friends with your classmates.", "Exactly or they offer reinforcing classes either after school or during less demanding classes.\nMy two oldest got support from a speech therapist during school hours to help them with the transition between the several languages (we are multilingual). They both where very successful after these classes and they missed minimal of the other classes.\n\nThere was a plan for my middle daughter to do the same year again but school decided against it as it was just 1 class she was failing, she just got additional support instead.", "This shows that the UK doesn't stand for all of Europe. In Germany, if you fail 2 important subjects (usually Maths, German, foreign languages, but can be others like Chemistry and Physics, too), you have to go back one year. It's also possible to go back during the school year when it becomes obvious that the child is failing.\n\nIn the case of learning impaired children, though, they are often kept in their years because it's more beneficial for them to stay with the kids they know. They are (ideally, not everything is wonderful in that respect) schooled by special teachers and it is acknowledged that they won't be able to reach the academic goals.", "Yep, parents like OP are part of the reason why I left teaching after 12 years. OP YTA, majorly.", "Yup all this. Parents in the US think they know best. That\u2019s why all the teachers are quitting. Making room for the parents who obviously know our job so much better than us. Haha", "Nothing against you or your chosen profession, but this story illustrates how far behind the rest of the world the U.S. is in education.  And we aren't making it any better by pandering to the religious right.", "Agree. Parents like this are why I quit teaching. Especially since admin here in the US supports these crazies over their teachers. US admin are probably why this parent is shocked no one agrees with her.", "Thank you for what you do!!! I understand your frustrations and I agree with YTA!!! It\u2019s time for Americans to stop being so entitled and I sympathize with you!!! You are teaching our future and I know they don\u2019t just let you flip your job!!! This mother needs to realize this", "Very true! When my daughter fell behind in schoolwork we approached her teacher to ask what could we do to support and encourage her as well as what resources were available to her or us as parents. The teacher helped us find free tutors that sat down with my daughter and helped her understand the areas she didn't understand. She was a B/C student and now she's an A/B student. I'm very proud of her!!", "OP also had the opportunity to put their son in a grade that matched his current education level...but they refused the recommendation. They knew full well that he was going to struggle, but decided their appearance was more important than their child being placed properly in school. It's the consequences of their actions and the one suffering the most is their child. Real parents of the year.", "THIS. But also why refuse to have him in a lower grade when the stuff be learned last years they covered 2 years ago?? \nShe made it even harder for their child to do well. \n\nAlso YTA for being entitled  by asking the teacher to do your job, OP.", "Also, they gave her the option of moving him back a grade where he would get a better foundation, and they refused.", "How dare you expect his parents to take actual responsibility for their children learning!\nHow can they possibly blame someone else when things go wrong if they take an active role in these situations?\n\nYou\u2019ll note that at no point does it seem to occur to OP that they could take a hands in approach and institute time each night to sit down and go through schoolwork with their child. There will be no learning in this house!\n\n(In case the sarcasm is not evident, I completely agree with you, but I don\u2019t expect OP to pull their head out if their rear end far en high ti see that they don\u2019t get to handball responsibility)", "Honestly I think one research said that the students are actually less stressed becouse they don't have to go home, use 6hours on home work, just to get a new tons of homework the next day. And less stressed students, allows them to learn better. \n\nI would need to look it up, but I am fairly sure that was used as a reason when they started to cut back on how much homework students are given. \nAnd now only do the week long essay projects mainly.", "I think the reason OP wanted the teacher to assign homework was so that teacher would grade it and average in those marks to his final grade, based on this comment:\n\n*I see the issue and went to the teacher asking her to give them homework to help him structure his study better and to grade it so he can get some good grades to help with his final grade.*\n\nSadly the parent doesn't realize that the point of school is to **learn**...not to somehow skate by with a passing grade by \"whatever means necessary\".", "Quite the opposite! There have been studies that homework, especially at the level seen in the US, can be detrimental to learning. Any homework should have purpose and not just be busywork. Or should be assignments not finished in class that students get help from a tutor with.", "lol the entire post belongs in /shitamericanssay. my son became an idiot while enrolled in the american educational system and is now well behind his european peers. i've tried going to the manager and suing, what else can i do???", "I just chuckled so hard into my coffee I almost spilled it. Thanks \"OP\" for the amazing laugh. \ud83d\ude02", "I agree. \nAs soon as they are out of the school, it's our job as parents to make sure it gets done. Teachers already do alot of work in the class rooms (at least the schools I know) they can't be responsible for the homes too. \n\nHopefully the school system in the UK will some day start to adapt to less homework. I promise it took a good while before they started experimenting with it here.", "Honestly as a parent it has been a nice change seeing less homework , and nor having a crying kid anymore becouse he was struggling to do all the assignments they were constantly given.\n\nThe week long projects they do now in geography, English etc. Seems alot better. They learn in depth about a single subject while having to find the informations etc. And he's having more fun while learning and seems far more interested in what he is putting together before the presentation in class. Where the constant homework.... I doubt he was actually reading or really learning anything, rather than just speeding through it to meet deadlines. \nHis school has been doing the less homework thing the last, I think 2-3 years. And the difference is so big.", "it works better for some people, honestly. I went from the Scottish system (lots of different maths through the year) to the USA one when I was a teenager and I found the, year of algebra, then a year of trig, then pre calc, etc much better for my learning. interestingly I was also better at calculus than my classmates when I moved back to England for uni. on the other hand I struggled in some areas because they assumed a level of stats knowledge that they all got in A levels/Highers but I didn't because high level stats was optional at my USA high school.\n\nhonestly I don't think either system is inherently superior, but moving between - especially in the middle of compulsory education - is very rough", "So true. Teachers here are over worked and underpaid because parents expect them to take on all of the educational responsibilities. It\u2019s insane to expect a teacher to take on more when all OP has to do is tell their kid to do the optional worksheets and get them a tutor.", "The problem here, as described, is that he\u2019s not doing his work.  I agree that a carrot rather than a stick will be more effective - that is a good point.", "You have the hardest job in teaching industry!  I am going to agree with you because healthcare is my specialty not education/teaching so you know more than me!", "They offered to put him into a lower grade in general I think.. not just for maths", "Same here.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I was the school counselor and had to deal with all sides.", "We are actively trying to destroy public education in the US. It\u2019s not even subtle. Underfund and then label as failing. Demonize teachers, get worse replacements for cheap, label the results as failing. Drive parents to charters, private schools, and homeschooling. Continue to label public as failing without actually fixing the issues. It\u2019s not a mistake, it\u2019s a money/power grab.", "Way to go, sister! That is exactly the key to success. I worked with kids coaching athletics for a long time and the parents who kindly approached me for help got an entire different answer than parents who were hateful.", "Wow, I must have skipped that! So the school has offered solutions and resources, the parents are just expecting a 14 year old to magically know information & learning styles that he\u2019s never experienced. So instead of having one hard discussion to move him down a grade, they\u2019re letting him fail and will make him resent the education system. Cool.", "Yep. Learning isn\u2019t all about rote memorization\u2026 at all. But that\u2019s how colonial education systems were set up during the industrial revolution. \n\nAn educated population demands rights, like an appropriate amount of work vs free time. Homework is a good solution to ensure kids are broken quickly to work long hours in factories :) \n\nAlso, rote memorization + testing is considered an easy way to gauge where learning is at for govt systems, etc regardless of how incompetent of a measurement it is. Standardized testing creates huge gaps between those who have the time and money to sit and memorize the character\u2019s names from Romeo and Juliet vs those who have to work a part time job to help their single mom make ends meet.\n\nDeep learning = hands on, place based, student let inquiry.", "My friend is a teacher who doesn't give homework. Her take on it is - if the kid didn't understand the thing they learned in class, homework will not help them in any way. If the kid did understand the thing, they don't need homework. \n\nYta op. You just made your kid suffer all by yourself by not putting him a year lower.", "\u2764\ufe0f Kindness is the answer.", "The whole rote memorisation just punishes kids who happen to have a bad memory and it's so dumb.\n\nI was amazing at maths through most of school (when maths is still logic based and nor formula based) I went from consistently in top classes or in a split class say year 1 students in a year 2 class.\n\nThe second I got to the type of maths where the only thing you need to do is memorise a formula and substitute numbers immediately my results started dropping, did I suddenly become bad at maths no, did the way teachers expected us to learn end up killing my love of maths yes.\n\nThe education system needs changing man", "Honestly that is an amazing take. \nHomework will just be frustrating if they didn't understand the material too and make a kid feel dumb for not getting it (I felt that with math. My brain is just not wired for it)", "Love it and his take is back up by peer reviewed research."]}
