I\u2019m assuming the bathroom table is the same as the counter - I mean how messy did you actually leave it for her to be complaining? I would understand if you\u2019re going around out of your way to make more of a mess than necessary. \n\nThat being said. Even if she is a SAHP, you still gotta tidy up after yourself.", "NTA and I don\u2019t get the YTA\u2019s here. You seem to have fleshed out the deal you two have well in advance. If she doesn\u2019t like it, she can find a job and her own place to live. \n\nIf you\u2019re taking advantage of her staying at home by being extra messy, then your the AH. But if it\u2019s normal for you to leave a mess here and there that your maid takes care of (or you clean up later), I\u2019m not seeing the issue.", "NTA and the people that are saying youre the AH sound like they just want to be mad at you for being the breadwinner and expecting something from your GF.  It seems like that was an agreed upon condition of her moving in. She pays a lot less than you and contributes to the relationship by assisting more in with the home duties.  Now she probably is getting comfortable and is trying to test out how much she can get away with, be careful it\u2019s a slippery slope.", "NTA for leaving 3 bottles of serum out. But YTA to yourself for letting a leech freeload off you and sit on her ass while complaining to you about you not cleaning. Kick the leech out and move on to someone who is an actual partner not a fuckin dependent", "Wtf do you live in paying 3.6k", "If your gf really was fine with doing all the chores; organizing your things isn\u2019t really a chore. Dishes and laundry is a chore; but if you use something it\u2019s just courtesy to put it back.\nHaving said that, she\u2019s got a pretty comfy situation that will make it easy for her to get a new job without the stress of rent and the like.

You will only expect her to do the equal of taking out the trash, and doing the laundry and dishes.  In return, she can pay half the rent and the utilities, and half the cost of the maid.\n\nNTA", "Nope.  As a stay at home partner, the home is 100% her job.  People always being up the that that they are \"always\" home so they never get to leave their place of work.  That is BS.  Unless you live in a frickin enormous masion all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and anything else to keep a house nice can be done in Way less than 8 hours a day.  I'd she worked for 4 hours a day (which is still more than needed) then it would never be dirty or unorganized.", "You need to get her out of your place ASAP. Do not get her pregnant", "NTA. The Y T A votes are insane, if you\u2019re not working all day and you\u2019re paying such a small % of the living expenses you can clean up the house. If she has such a problem with their pre-discussed arrangement she can go back to paying all her own expenses and doing an even greater proportion of the housework in her own place.", "NTA obviously, it seems in the comments you realized that shes stressed too looking for a job and probably just had a bad morning as well. You should just explain to her like you did in the comments that you were rushing for work and just forgot and that you would appreciate some leeway in situations like that as its not really that big of a deal, in the same note though you need to give her some leeway in the way she reacted as well", "NTA. I don't understand if the other people here aren't reading or what, but you're doing the basics. doing the trash, laundry & dishes and hiring out the deep cleaning is perfectly reasonable if you have the funds to do so. She asked for you to let go of your hired out help, and then freaks out about leaving 3 bottles out on the counter? That seems unreasonable if her even if she were a stay at home parent. Having your home look lived in a bit is fine.\n\nThis reminds me of my roommate who would freak out that I kept a blanket in the living room. I use a blanket all year round (usually just on my feet in the summer) and practically every day, lol. I'd put it away when not-my-guests were coming, but otherwise I never understood why it freaked her out so much.", "NTA dude\n\nYou work hard and she went into this with the understanding that you do basic stuff but would ordinarily have a maid come and clean what you didn't. You do MORE than make up for your lack of household chores, as the sole provider of finances sans $600.. which doesn't sound like much where you are. \n\nYou don't sound like a slob, she overreacted and I think it's important that you refresh your agreement. You DO clean up after yourself (and her) by essentially doing the laundry, dishes, and taking out the trash. That is more than a lot of people can say. Has she held up her end at all? Or is she simply sitting around, claiming to be looking for a job and complaining about how you left something out?", "What the fuck is a \"stay at home girlfriend\"?\n\nDude, dont take this crap.\nYour house, your rules.", "NTA.\n\nUse this as a learning moment, because is this someone you'd want to own a home or have kids with?", "NTA you gave her expectations and she completely agreed. if she yelled at you for 3 serum bottles she is controlling and/or is dating you for the money and ease of life.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you need another sit down to re-iterate what you said before she moved in. Also if three open bottles bother her that much, she should consider other living arrangements.\n\nI also think you should consider living somewhere a bit cheaper. 3.6k is an awful lot of money.", "NTA it's your place you can leave shit wherever the hell you want lol. However even if she was going 50/50 on the bills and such, it's a stupid thing to get mad at your partner about. Choose your battles. A few open bottles on the bathroom counter is not one of them lol.", "Probably yeah, I had a similar situation w an ex who paid like 15% of our living costs because she couldn\u2019t have afforded to split them and I wasn\u2019t gonna live down, there\u2019s a big difference between whose doing the chores and expecting a live in maid who cleans up after you", "NTA. She knows what she got into. It\u2019s fair too.", "You're not the AH. You clearly set out the rules and she is not adhering. Putting the tops back on three bottles does not even count as a chore - it would have taken her seconds.\nIt's only right and proper that she contributes to the household by taking on all the housework, it's the least she can do bearing in mind your generosity. \nIf you back down now she'll gradually do less and less, I guarantee it\nStick to your guns , you're not the AH.", "NTA, she is lazy and shirking her responsibility to hold her weight", "INFO- what will the arrangement be whenever your girlfriend finds a new job? Also, what kind of job do you work that\u2019s so stressful you can\u2019t make your own bed or cook?", "Normal people still clean up after themselves and keep their stuff reasonably organized.", "NTA. And love this group as I can always expect them to find something a man did wrong. If you didn't do anything explicitly wrong then just give enough context and details they'll find a way to call you the asshole.\n\nAll that aside. I almost leaned into calling you the asshole because for real this issue is so small is it even worth coming to Reddit for it? Like come on man. Some of us out here have real fuckin problems.\n\nNTA I guess..", "NTA, she\u2019s probably stressed with job huntunting and acting out. Reinforce your boundaries and stand your ground. Is there anywhere cheaper you could rent also lol.", "NTA. You have the income to have a maid which makes your life easier. Leaving a couple things out isn\u2019t the same as being dirty. If she\u2019s a reasonable person normally I\u2019d check in with her and see if this complaint isn\u2019t actually about that but she\u2019s focusing on that bc she hasn\u2019t figured out how to communicate what she\u2019s really worried about yet. Otherwise something sounds up with her. From your info it sounds like normally she\u2019s an amazing partner for you and has been there for you a lot. So I wouldn\u2019t throw in the towel till you get to the bottom of it. Maybe it\u2019s her anxiety about not having a job in her field yet. Hopefully it\u2019s just a one off thing and y\u2019all can talk it out. But yea you aren\u2019t the asshole", "NTA\n\nReddit white knights will come as a swarm to say otherwise.", "This makes no difference but what serums did you use? \nAnd Nta", "NTA. Also, do you personally care about the \u201cmess\u201d you left (aka: 3 bottles)? Sounds like she\u2019s the only one that\u2019s worried about it. Were you pressuring her to clean it? If not, she needs to either ignore it, or do it herself if it bothers her so badly.", "YTA for having a \"stay at home girlfriend\" and comping her *three thousand dollars a month* in rent while she does nothing useful. \n\nHave some self respect, man. You shouldn't be living together at all. You're *dating*. If she's not raising your children full time you DEFINITELY shouldn't be paying her bills while she doesn't work.\n\nFor three thousand dollars a month I'd have that place cleaner than a NASA assembly lab.", "INFO: how old are you two?", "NTA you came to an agreement before you let her move in. Your house your rules. If she doesn\u2019t pay a dime she can clean", "That text was a bad idea. Never fight over text. It\u2019s completely counterproductive, no one reacts well to a critical text out of the blue. I\u2019ll venture a guess that it\u2019s not even about the bottles, it\u2019s about your habit of not picking up after yourself, but this was really not the right way to bring it up. \n\nYou being mad that she\u2019s mad is not a great dynamic. You haven\u2019t even heard her out yet but you\u2019ve already decided how you feel about her position. You seem very rigid. You think that nothing about your life should change just because she moved in. You justify this because she\u2019s not working or paying much toward bills. But, if you\u2019re honest with yourself, you wouldn\u2019t suddenly want to become a neat freak if she were paying half. If you want to build a life with this person then you will have to accommodate her and compromise on your living situation. ESH.", "NAH. You should always pick up after yourself if you aren't currently, but this example of 3 bottles of serum seems very minor. Now, if you have a pattern of not picking up after yourself, she has every right to be upset. People don't usually get that upset if it's not a recurrent problem, IMO. As far as the cleaning arrangement, if that's your mutually agreeable arrangement, it sounds fine. If she was a stay at home mom, I would totally disapprove of her doing the vast majority of housework, but it doesn't sound like she's doing anything else.", "YTA.\n\nNot having a spotless home is fine. Not doing the deeper cleaning is fine and understandable. But you\u2019re talking about the absolute bare minimum to do any sort of cleaning up after yourself - that\u2019s still expected of you, I don\u2019t care how big a deal you make out of the stress of your job.", "I suspect you'd have been mad had those serum bottles been spilt. YTA it takes two seconds to put the lid on something you opened, preventing an accident. Just because you talk about how busy you are, doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.", "YTA. I think asking her to the housework is fair until she finds a job, but that doesn't mean you're exempt from cleaning up after yourself. You should still be looking after yourself and you shouldn't be leaving things everywhere for her to put away. \n\nIt's kind of like leaving the cap off the toothpaste and then expecting her to follow behind you and put the cap on. Yeah, she agreed to clean, but she didn't agree to be your mother. There are things you are capable of doing for yourself that you shouldn't be relying on her for. Put your own caps on your serums, it literally takes two seconds.\n\nEDIT: This guy left three open containers on a counter. Do you guys really think it's wrong for his GF to remind him to close them? Just because you pay bills doesn't mean your partner isn't allowed to speak up about your bad habits.", "YTA to yourself and the relationship.

Just because he\u2019s paying the bills doesn\u2019t mean she should have to follow behind him to clean up whatever it is he\u2019s touched.

It's an insanely easy thing for OP to do, and it doesn't make sense for him to leave them open in the first place.

It seems like he takes a small critique as not being appreciated and is using him taking care of finances as a means to say he\u2019s above criticism. But he even admits in comments that *she* felt he was doing a lot for her and was the reason why he fired the maid so she can clean. It seems as if the appreciation for what she is doing is missing on his part.
