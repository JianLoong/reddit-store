I\u2019m assuming the bathroom table is the same as the counter - I mean how messy did you actually leave it for her to be complaining? I would understand if you\u2019re going around out of your way to make more of a mess than necessary. \n\nThat being said. Even if she is a SAHP, you still gotta tidy up after yourself.", "NTA and I don\u2019t get the YTA\u2019s here. You seem to have fleshed out the deal you two have well in advance. If she doesn\u2019t like it, she can find a job and her own place to live. \n\nIf you\u2019re taking advantage of her staying at home by being extra messy, then your the AH. But if it\u2019s normal for you to leave a mess here and there that your maid takes care of (or you clean up later), I\u2019m not seeing the issue.", "NTA and the people that are saying youre the AH sound like they just want to be mad at you for being the breadwinner and expecting something from your GF.  It seems like that was an agreed upon condition of her moving in. She pays a lot less than you and contributes to the relationship by assisting more in with the home duties.  Now she probably is getting comfortable and is trying to test out how much she can get away with, be careful it\u2019s a slippery slope.", "NTA for leaving 3 bottles of serum out. But YTA to yourself for letting a leech freeload off you and sit on her ass while complaining to you about you not cleaning. Kick the leech out and move on to someone who is an actual partner not a fuckin dependent", "Wtf do you live in paying 3.6k", "If your gf really was fine with doing all the chores; organizing your things isn\u2019t really a chore. Dishes and laundry is a chore; but if you use something it\u2019s just courtesy to put it back.\nHaving said that, she\u2019s got a pretty comfy situation that will make it easy for her to get a new job without the stress of rent and the like. I don\u2019t think she should be sending passive aggressive texts like that at work. That\u2019s not an urgent matter; she should have just talked about it when you got home.

You will only expect her to do the equal of taking out the trash, and doing the laundry and dishes.  In return, she can pay half the rent and the utilities, and half the cost of the maid.\n\nNTA", "Nope.  As a stay at home partner, the home is 100% her job.  People always being up the that that they are \"always\" home so they never get to leave their place of work.  That is BS.  Unless you live in a frickin enormous masion all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and anything else to keep a house nice can be done in Way less than 8 hours a day.  I'd she worked for 4 hours a day (which is still more than needed) then it would never be dirty or unorganized.", "You need to get her out of your place ASAP. Do not get her pregnant", "NTA. The Y T A votes are insane, if you\u2019re not working all day and you\u2019re paying such a small % of the living expenses you can clean up the house. If she has such a problem with their pre-discussed arrangement she can go back to paying all her own expenses and doing an even greater proportion of the housework in her own place.", "NTA obviously, it seems in the comments you realized that shes stressed too looking for a job and probably just had a bad morning as well. You should just explain to her like you did in the comments that you were rushing for work and just forgot and that you would appreciate some leeway in situations like that as its not really that big of a deal, in the same note though you need to give her some leeway in the way she reacted as well", "NTA. I don't understand if the other people here aren't reading or what, but you're doing the basics. doing the trash, laundry & dishes and hiring out the deep cleaning is perfectly reasonable if you have the funds to do so. She asked for you to let go of your hired out help, and then freaks out about leaving 3 bottles out on the counter? That seems unreasonable if her even if she were a stay at home parent. Having your home look lived in a bit is fine.\n\nThis reminds me of my roommate who would freak out that I kept a blanket in the living room. I use a blanket all year round (usually just on my feet in the summer) and practically every day, lol. I'd put it away when not-my-guests were coming, but otherwise I never understood why it freaked her out so much.", "NTA dude\n\nYou work hard and she went into this with the understanding that you do basic stuff but would ordinarily have a maid come and clean what you didn't. You do MORE than make up for your lack of household chores, as the sole provider of finances sans $600.. which doesn't sound like much where you are. \n\nYou don't sound like a slob, she overreacted and I think it's important that you refresh your agreement. You DO clean up after yourself (and her) by essentially doing the laundry, dishes, and taking out the trash. That is more than a lot of people can say. Has she held up her end at all? Or is she simply sitting around, claiming to be looking for a job and complaining about how you left something out?", "What the fuck is a \"stay at home girlfriend\"?\n\nDude, dont take this crap.\nYour house, your rules.", "NTA.\n\nUse this as a learning moment, because is this someone you'd want to own a home or have kids with?", "NTA you gave her expectations and she completely agreed. if she yelled at you for 3 serum bottles she is controlling and/or is dating you for the money and ease of life.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you need another sit down to re-iterate what you said before she moved in. Also if three open bottles bother her that much, she should consider other living arrangements.\n\nI also think you should consider living somewhere a bit cheaper. 3.6k is an awful lot of money.", "NTA it's your place you can leave shit wherever the hell you want lol. However even if she was going 50/50 on the bills and such, it's a stupid thing to get mad at your partner about. Choose your battles. A few open bottles on the bathroom counter is not one of them lol.", "Probably yeah, I had a similar situation w an ex who paid like 15% of our living costs because she couldn\u2019t have afforded to split them and I wasn\u2019t gonna live down, there\u2019s a big difference between whose doing the chores and expecting a live in maid who cleans up after you", "NTA. She knows what she got into. It\u2019s fair too.", "You're not the AH. You clearly set out the rules and she is not adhering. Putting the tops back on three bottles does not even count as a chore - it would have taken her seconds.\nIt's only right and proper that she contributes to the household by taking on all the housework, it's the least she can do bearing in mind your generosity. \nIf you back down now she'll gradually do less and less, I guarantee it\nStick to your guns , you're not the AH.", "NTA, she is lazy and shirking her responsibility to hold her weight", "INFO- what will the arrangement be whenever your girlfriend finds a new job? Also, what kind of job do you work that\u2019s so stressful you can\u2019t make your own bed or cook?", "Normal people still clean up after themselves and keep their stuff reasonably organized.", "NTA. And love this group as I can always expect them to find something a man did wrong. If you didn't do anything explicitly wrong then just give enough context and details they'll find a way to call you the asshole.\n\nAll that aside. I almost leaned into calling you the asshole because for real this issue is so small is it even worth coming to Reddit for it? Like come on man. Some of us out here have real fuckin problems.\n\nNTA I guess..", "NTA, she\u2019s probably stressed with job huntunting and acting out. Reinforce your boundaries and stand your ground. Is there anywhere cheaper you could rent also lol.", "NTA. You have the income to have a maid which makes your life easier. Leaving a couple things out isn\u2019t the same as being dirty. If she\u2019s a reasonable person normally I\u2019d check in with her and see if this complaint isn\u2019t actually about that but she\u2019s focusing on that bc she hasn\u2019t figured out how to communicate what she\u2019s really worried about yet. Otherwise something sounds up with her. From your info it sounds like normally she\u2019s an amazing partner for you and has been there for you a lot. So I wouldn\u2019t throw in the towel till you get to the bottom of it. Maybe it\u2019s her anxiety about not having a job in her field yet. Hopefully it\u2019s just a one off thing and y\u2019all can talk it out. But yea you aren\u2019t the asshole", "NTA\n\nReddit white knights will come as a swarm to say otherwise.", "This makes no difference but what serums did you use? \nAnd Nta", "NTA. Also, do you personally care about the \u201cmess\u201d you left (aka: 3 bottles)? Sounds like she\u2019s the only one that\u2019s worried about it. Were you pressuring her to clean it? If not, she needs to either ignore it, or do it herself if it bothers her so badly.", "YTA for having a \"stay at home girlfriend\" and comping her *three thousand dollars a month* in rent while she does nothing useful. \n\nHave some self respect, man. You shouldn't be living together at all. You're *dating*. If she's not raising your children full time you DEFINITELY shouldn't be paying her bills while she doesn't work.\n\nFor three thousand dollars a month I'd have that place cleaner than a NASA assembly lab.", "INFO: how old are you two?", "NTA you came to an agreement before you let her move in. Your house your rules. If she doesn\u2019t pay a dime she can clean", "That text was a bad idea. Never fight over text. It\u2019s completely counterproductive, no one reacts well to a critical text out of the blue. I\u2019ll venture a guess that it\u2019s not even about the bottles, it\u2019s about your habit of not picking up after yourself, but this was really not the right way to bring it up. \n\nYou being mad that she\u2019s mad is not a great dynamic. You haven\u2019t even heard her out yet but you\u2019ve already decided how you feel about her position. You seem very rigid. You think that nothing about your life should change just because she moved in. You justify this because she\u2019s not working or paying much toward bills. But, if you\u2019re honest with yourself, you wouldn\u2019t suddenly want to become a neat freak if she were paying half. If you want to build a life with this person then you will have to accommodate her and compromise on your living situation. ESH.", "NAH. You should always pick up after yourself if you aren't currently, but this example of 3 bottles of serum seems very minor. Now, if you have a pattern of not picking up after yourself, she has every right to be upset. People don't usually get that upset if it's not a recurrent problem, IMO. As far as the cleaning arrangement, if that's your mutually agreeable arrangement, it sounds fine. If she was a stay at home mom, I would totally disapprove of her doing the vast majority of housework, but it doesn't sound like she's doing anything else.", "YTA.\n\nNot having a spotless home is fine. Not doing the deeper cleaning is fine and understandable. But you\u2019re talking about the absolute bare minimum to do any sort of cleaning up after yourself - that\u2019s still expected of you, I don\u2019t care how big a deal you make out of the stress of your job.", "I suspect you'd have been mad had those serum bottles been spilt. YTA it takes two seconds to put the lid on something you opened, preventing an accident. Just because you talk about how busy you are, doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.", "YTA. I think asking her to the housework is fair until she finds a job, but that doesn't mean you're exempt from cleaning up after yourself. You should still be looking after yourself and you shouldn't be leaving things everywhere for her to put away. \n\nIt's kind of like leaving the cap off the toothpaste and then expecting her to follow behind you and put the cap on. Yeah, she agreed to clean, but she didn't agree to be your mother. There are things you are capable of doing for yourself that you shouldn't be relying on her for. Put your own caps on your serums, it literally takes two seconds.\n\nEDIT: This guy left three open containers on a counter. Do you guys really think it's wrong for his GF to remind him to close them? Just because you pay bills doesn't mean your partner isn't allowed to speak up about your bad habits.", "YTA to yourself and the relationship.

I'm in the creative fields which means work can be very tough and unpredictable, but can pay really well when you have it. So, I can say from experience that being the one looking for a job when your partner is successfully situated can feel really complicated, and you probably will get in a few fights just because of pressure from each side. She has a law degree and everyone needs lawyers all the time though, and a larger firm should be able to sponsor her visa, even if the job market might not be the best at the moment. Because of her visa status, she may or may not qualify for unemployment, which would at least help her to feel like she's contributing more while she's looking, and also has a lot of great job finding resources.\n\nBased on you saying that you'll move with her to her home country if she can't find something, it sounds like you may really be in it with each other for the long haul. Look at it pragmatically if that's really the case or not, and really consider what you want for your own life, work, and future as that could be a HUGE trajectory shift and you really need to be on the same page. If she's the one, just do your best to support each other and give each other grace in times of uncertainty like this over petty fights etc. Even big fights often aren't so big after the fact if you're really both just stressed out, which it sounds like you are.\n\nIn the meantime, maybe offer to help her with interview practice, reading her resume, or take extra time to ask if she found any good postings to apply to that day in a curiosity-not-pressuring kind of way. Suggest she run her resume through Jobscan too if she hasn't yet for ATS keywords and such, and make sure she's looking on more than just LinkedIn. It's very likely she'll find something soon especially with the new year and it'll be a non-issue.\n\nGood luck to you both, OP!

It's because housework SUCKS - it's monotonous and thankless, it's absolutely possible to clean all day and no one even notice. Also we've got a real issue in our culture with household/care work not being valued as 'work', because it's generally unpaid. Maybe the two of you need a little more clarification about certain tasks like general tidying too - is it her responsibility to tidy up after you, is it something you should try to do on a daily basis, is it something she's ok just ignoring until you get to it or the maid does it, etc?

But unfortunately it's not a good/safe idea to be leaving things open now.\n\nYou're not an asshole, you're just not used to it.", "Nope.  You laid out how you live.  You laid out what you expect.  You laid out that you hired someone to help you.  She knew, going in, that she was getting almost free accommodations.  Now she wants to pick on little details???  She wants the original deal to be changed but isn\u2019t doing anything herself to change.  NTA.  And if leaving a few bottles open was the extent of my husband\u2019s messes, I\u2019d be ecstatic.", "I mean, I don\u2019t think you did anything that bad, but this also isn\u2019t a household chore. It\u2019s normal for people to close containers after they\u2019re done using them, it\u2019s like turning off the water when you\u2019re done brushing your teeth. This is kinda weird tbh. Not passive-aggressive-text worthy just yet, but also a bit concerning that you\u2019re an adult who can\u2019t close serum bottles when he\u2019s done with them. It\u2019s also kind of gross, especially if it\u2019s skin care. This is stuff you put on your face, presumably after you wash it, and you\u2019re leaving it exposed to potentially anything.", "NTA. You really need to think about if she belongs in your life. Bc she\u2019s showing you who she is. Believe her.", "You\u2019re a slob that is able to essentially make his gf a stay at home gf. You\u2019re a successful slob. lol\n\nI wouldn\u2019t throw it in her face that you pay everything because I just feel that it will only lead to resentment from one or both of you. If I were you, I\u2019d just clean up after myself and maybe do two simple things consistently like take out garbage and do dishes.", "She\u2019s mad about something else and this put her over the edge. I\u2019d plan a romantic evening and ask how she\u2019s doing.", "I mean sure, but just because he shouldn\u2019t be expected to deep clean the house after working all day, doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t screw the cap back on the toothpaste.", "Even if they do all the chores, they are still freeloading. If the working partner is ok with it than it's fine - but either way its freeeloading and it's not an equal deal.", "That doesn\u2019t mean he can just leave shit wherever it falls. Small things build up.", "the way people are getting at you is so wild to me. you guys have a particular setup that works for you two. doesn\u2019t make u a slob or her a leech. just talk to her yo.", "NTA this is perfect time to create strong foundation for how you handle conflict resolution together.  If you start with proving each other right/ wrong, you\u2019ll eventually hold some contempt for one another.  Neither are wrong. She\u2019s allowed to be annoyed by this and you\u2019re allowed to be annoyed that her expectations of you are different than you laid out.  Tell her that you\u2019re sorry it upset her, and at same time this isn\u2019t something about you that you think you should need to change.  Neither of you will be perfect, can you accept each others flaws? If so, then need to learn to pick your battles. \n\nAnother note, the longer you stay out of work force harder it is to readjust back into it, especially with a safety net that takes away the consequences of unemployment.  Nobody is above working fast food.  She can get part time work while applying elsewhere.", "> Yeah, there's a difference between cleaning the house and cleaning up after a fellow adult.\n\nThere's also a difference between op contributing towards the household bill, and op supporting another grown adult and paying for most of her share of the rent and all her expenses. Op agreed to do that in exchange for his girlfriend replacing his housekeeper/maid and her taking over the housekeeper's responsibilities. That includes a little tidying up. They both agreed to this, and she's getting the much better end of the deal here.

Chores are things like cooking, washing dishes, wiping surfaces, sweeping, dusting, cleaning toilets, etc.--things that will always need doing as a result of simply living in a home. You can't just leave your shit all over the place or leave bottles open for someone else to take care of and call it \"chores\". That is called being a slob.", "Except you expect her to pick up after you, other than putting clothes in the wash, dishes in the dishwasher and taking out the trash.\n\nHow old are the two of you?

You don't say what country you're in either, which is suspect due to different school programs.\n\nYour ages are quite relevant here. \n\nIf she had just finished school and is looking for a job she's job searching, networking and interviewing and forsnt have time to pick up after you", "It was the pinned post for like a week and a half", "They're all narcissists and gaslighters!

In other words take it all with a huge grain of salt! NTA!!", "That was my question too. If they're not yours @OP, then yeah that's kind of crappy, especially after revolving so much around the financial aspects. \n\nIf they are, it doesn't make you a slob, but you're removing the benefits facial care has by allowing bacteria to grow when it's open. Now that there's a cat in the house, he could ultimately be smearing some of the allergens on his face lol.\n\nI could also see an open container being a cat-toppling danger. Serum is not fun to clean up.", "So send a passive aggressive text to the person completely supporting you instead of being supportive yourself and just put the caps on? That's what? 3 seconds? A lot faster than bitching at him while he's going to work to feed another grown person.", "No it literally does.

Chances are he's equally freaking out over nothing in regard to his gfs response.", "Passive aggressive in OPs opinion and as seen by his comments and the way he's written this post he seems to be a fairly unreliable opinon. He's acting as if the most mundane comments here are attacks on him to the point I'm just gonna assume it's ESH best case. Wouldn't be at all surprised if his definition of passive aggressive is just her notifying him he left them open.", "Should she be wiping his ass too? He can pick up after himself as he goes. He\u2019s not a child.", "Yeah, you\u2019re blowing this way out of proportion.

I think the point, whether they intended it to be or not, is that if you know your partner is stressed out, especially about some major part of their live/your lives (job, home, bills,\u2026) maybe you don\u2019t add to that with something as insignificant as the cap the to toothpaste.", "> Your partner is not a servant \n\nHe's not treating her like a servant any more than she's treating him like an atm machine. Or a slave. He goes to work at an extremely difficult job all day and then comes home and hands her a nice chunk of his money and she lives off his dime. That's actually how slavery would sometimes work back in the day. \n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with their arrangement and I don't really think she views him as an atm machine anymore than he views her as a servant. Just pointing out that calling her a servant doesn't really make any sense.", "Idk why the mods are leaving your comments up, tbh.

But it's also fine for her to remind him not to leave open serums on their table. \n\nIt also doesn't really matter how much money he makes, he shouldn't expect her to go behind him and do every single thing for him, or for her to never express frustration at his bad habits. He can and should be putting caps on his own serums and not leaving open containers on their counter.", "Thank you!!", "I think you're probably right. This post definitely seems like a weird overreaction. Like even the title is overboard on his part:\n\n>AITA Being the only income and **being mad at stay at home girlfriend for expecting me to clean up**\n\nHe says he's mad she expects him to clean up, but all she wants is for him to put caps on his own serums when he's done using them. That's... not cleaning up lol. Like who doesn't already do that? Does this guy not put the cap back on the milk when he pours a glass?\n\nHe's also kind of fudging the \"being the only income\" part too. She doesn't have a job, but OP said she's paying six hundred dollars a month toward expenses. For an immigrant in a foreign country with no income, that's a pretty big sum of money she's spending out of her savings each month. I get that it doesn't make a dent in his own expenses and he's contributing significantly more than she does, but it definitely feels like he's underselling what she contributes.\n\nEspecially since I don't really think his expenses changed drastically since she moved in. Sure, bills go up a bit, but he cut the expense of the maid he used to have because she now does the cleaning. Plus, she also gives him six hundred dollars a month. I feel like OP thinks his GF is just taking him for a ride and should be grateful for all he does for her, but the arrangement is a pretty swell gig for him too when you really think about it.", "Even just notifying him seems unnecessary. Wait till he gets home and mention it in passing. No need to bring it up while he's at his already stressful job.", "No, he's a grown adult who has paid for a service he's chosen not to do himself.

He LITERALLY pays for a maid! He takes care of his laundry and dishes. But to you, putting a cap on a bottle is every single thing? Nawwwwwww. \n\nAnd her \"reminding\" him while he's at his already stressful job when she can just as easily wait till he gets home is not fine at all. He's sparring then both. She shouldn't make his day any more stressful than it needs to be.\n\nLast, he told her how he was from the jump. She still decided to move in. If he can put up with his allergies for her she can deal with something this small for him.

So he cut the expense of a maid, the GF does the cleaning, and she gives him six hundred dollars a month to boot. He's more than breaking even with this arrangement. \n\n>And her \"reminding\" him while he's at his already stressful job when she can just as easily wait till he gets home is not fine at all. \n\nThis honestly just makes OP look bad, not the other way around. Why does he have to be reminded to put lids on things?  Who would want to leave their skincare products open to begin with? It's not good for them, and they can get spilled and wasted. He shouldn't need to be reminded to do this at all.\n\n>She shouldn't make his day any more stressful than it needs to be.\n\nYour partner messaging you and telling you not to leave things open on counters is not stress inducing. It's really not that big of a deal unless you're OP and feel the need to make a whole post about it.\n\n>Last, he told her how he was from the jump.\n\nAgreeing to do household chores is different than being someone's personal servant. OP still has to do things for himself. It's wild to think his GF should be following him around and closing containers for him. That's something people do for toddlers.\n\n> Don't pretend like she's not already getting the better part of this deal as it is.\n\nDon't pretend like OP doesn't benefit from this arrangement. He cut the expense of a maid and has a GF who does the cleaning instead and pays him six hundred dollars a month on top of that. His rent likely hasn't gone up since she moved in, and I doubt the utilities have gone up that significantly either. He's definitely benefitting financially from having a live in bangmaid.", "And if you both agree to it then enjoy the meal!", "But he's not mad at his girlfriend for not following behind him closing caps for him. Why are you making that up? He has not made any complaints about the amount of cleaning she does or does not do."]}
