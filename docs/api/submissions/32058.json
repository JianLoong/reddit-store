Modern bumpers are \"plastic\" (or fiberglass or what have you), often over a steel core.  The outer shell of the bumper denting or breaking means that it absorbed some of the force of a collision, and that's better than the force of the collision damaging the car in a structural way.\n\n(It's like those posts showing you the result of a modern car in a bad collision, versus like a 50s car that's \"all steel\".  The modern car is totalled, and the 50s car may have less visible damage.  But the modern car is designed like that.  There is a steel cage around the interior - where the humans would be - that is designed to stay intact, while the rest of the car crumples to absorb the kinetic energy of the collision. The old 50s car might look better on the outside, but a lot of the force of the collision was transferred to the people inside the car.  So the outcomes to the two cars look very different, but the more important thing is the outcome to the people who were inside the car.)\n\nI mean, granted -- a bumper that gets damaged just by a soccer ball being kicked into it seems kind of overzealous.
