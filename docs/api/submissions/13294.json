My father lives in a city almost 3 hours away from us. He recently decided that he wants my siblings (15F&13M) and I to move in with him because he has been feeling lonely and thinks it is high time we give our grandparents some space (my mom passed away in 2018 and my siblings and i have grown up with my grand parents. I also have a love hate relationship with my father). Prior to this in 2016 (i was only 16 then)  he made us all move to a new city just because \"that is where he was born and he wants his privacy\". i had to leave my education look after my two very young siblings and the home while my mom was sick in another city and my father kept traveling for business (I was alone). So long story short i came back to the city where i grew up after my mums demise and started studying to complete my grad and work as well. I recently spoke to my father and he started talking about how he wants us to come live with him and wants me to get a job there. We had a huge argument over it because i refused to do so. My whole career has been settling down really well, i have a job i love to do and there's still a lot i want to explore in my working field (planning on a small start-up in a next few months). I  have moved between cities atleast 3 times now because of him and i feel its high time for me to settle and do something for myself. he tries to guilt trip me saying that i dont care for him or my siblings and that i am being selfish as i am only thinking about my career. That being said the only reason he wants us to move is because he has been feeling lonely (he accepted the fact). I mean i cant help it in anyway. i have a job and i study as well and i have plans for my future which i know i will never be able to do/achieve if i move.  i also look after my siblings and do as much as i can for them, they mean alot to me. I've had a very traumatic past while i lived there, got addicted to things i shldnt have. And it took me a long time to come out of it. With that being said the last thing i want is to move back there and ruin thing/my plans again.

Your siblings are in highschool and moving again is not goos after settling after your mothers death. What happens in a few years when your dad wants his alone time again (he might just boot out your siblings to a city without solid support too).\n\nAny chance your dad is hoping you help him with the bills too? I suspect he wants you to take a solid job to help fund your siblings.", "NTA\n\nIf he feels lonely, it's time for him as a father to finally make a \"sacrifice\" (his selfishness) and uproot himself - moving to your city, not in your house, so that he won't mess up his kids'life again.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re the only one who gets to decide where you eventually want to live.

To some people no matter you do it's never enough so learn to accept it and not try to fill their bottomless pit. \n\nHes gonna work his way to all 3 of you not living near him when old enough, he may get your siblings but if not a great dad, they'll end up leaving him you when they can.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult.  It's completely normal to make your own choices about where you live and work when you're 23.  \n\nAlso, it might be worth considering what you get out of your relationship with your Dad, if anything.  He seems to be in and out of your life as it suits him, and doesn't put you or your siblings first in any way.  You have the option of allowing yourself to choose who you consider to be your family, and whom you expend your energy on.  It sounds like your siblings and grandparents have treated you with love, but your Dad really hasn't much.  Maybe stop giving Dad more care and worry than he gives you.

Don\u2019t let him guilt you.", "NTA - if anybody should move - its him!  He has had no trouble moving in the past.", "NTA. He's free to move where you guys are if he's feeling that lonely. Seriously, he uproot your life and abandoned you after you lost your mum, he can kick rocks.", "NTA, you stay put. If he's lonely he needs to get friends. If your grandparents want to change anything, they will bring that up with you themselves. \n\nYou are an adult. If my parents called and told me to move home because they're lonely I would laugh at them. But I have a **great** relationship with them, they are there for me, I am there for them, no tangled messes here. Your father sounds like a weird child or something. Stay away!", "NTA.  You're an adult with your life working out.

All this and you are helping him pay bills? Cut him off. NTA.", "NTA. You are an adult and can chose where you live. Your responsibility is to yourself and your future plans.", "Absolutely NTA! Quite honestly, it sounds like you should consider no or decreased contact with him - he unfairly guilts you to do what HE wants, with pretty much no regard to you or your siblings (regardless of what he says, a sudden move is NOT good for your siblings). \n\nFamily is who you choose day in and day in.

NTA", "Consider the person making these accusations.  He abandoned his grieving kids to go elsewhere, and only wants them now because he's lonely, not because he cares about them.  And you just know that, when he meets some chick and isn't lonely anymore, he's just going to ditch you guys again. \n\nThis person is not a good father.  He's not even an adequate or mediocre father. Everything he's saying about you is just him projecting his own failures onto you. \n\n*He's* the one that doesn't do enough for your siblings,  or for you for that matter.  He's the one that failed  yall. \n\nI know it's easier said than done,  but pretty much anything he says is meaningless, manipulative,  or deceptive, and should be ignored.", "I mean... I don't have kids yet so maybe I've got the wrong end of the stick here, but last I checked it was the PARENTS who are supposed to do things for their kids, not a kid's responsibility to do things for their younger siblings. You are 23, you have your own life to live, your own dreams to follow, and it's not your job to be a parent in this scenario, even though it sounds like you've done more for them than he has. The selfish AH in this situation is your father.", "NTA\n\nAnd you should feel free to point out what a hypocrite he is.  ***Prior to this in 2016 (i was only 16 then) he made us all move to a new city just because \"that is where he was born and he wants his privacy\".*** So he has no problems uprooting the kids for his personal/selfish reason, but you are supposed to bend to his will as an adult. And I am going to throw in some gender bias here as well, since the OP is female. Of course women are always happy to drop everything in their lives to cater to the whims of men. \n\nNTA - do what you need to do for you and your future. The real reason he wants you to move to is that you need to play the parent and he can take teh credit.", "NTA. You\u2019re supporting yourself, you\u2019re an adult, you choose where you live. \n\nIt\u2019s not even an argument - he doesn\u2019t get the choice, so he can have an opinion but his opinion on where you live matters only as much as you want it to.", "NTA.", "Just tell him that's rich coming from a 'father' who abandoned his children.", "INFO: Why WOULD you care for him?

You are an adult, and sounds like your life is on a pretty good track. You don't have to move, you can stay where you are. I believe he will not want your siblings to come without you. Why? Because he wants you to come  and clean & cook for HIM. And also take care of siblings. Don't do it. Stand your ground. And do NOT encourage him to move to your city. \n\nGood luck OP. Stand strong.  You've done so well with your life.", ">I know it's easier said than done, but pretty much anything he says is meaningless, manipulative, or deceptive, and should be ignored.\n\n-Me, talking to myself about my mother every time she pulls some shit or does anything even something seemingly positive or harmless, anymore.\n\n[For the TL;DR crowd, if it's going to bother you that there's more than a sentence or two here, well, the italics are as close as I'm getting to summarizing this difficult topic so]\n\n*What sucks is you can know this, know in your whole heart and your mind that they don't care enough about you or aren't even capable of it, in my case, and still it can snare you.*\n\nMy mom is literally every flavor of abusive except one, I know now that she has a severe personality disorder on top of bipolar and that due to her emotional immaturity, she is incapable of not being self-centered and can hardly understand the concept of others actually being people and them having needs let alone *feelings* like she does. \n\nThe mentality of a small child, coupled with their inability to totally understand empathy (natural for a child, not for an adult), as well as the most cutthroat selfish nature...leads to people who shouldn't having kids and then treating them as a living workhorse in multiple ways usually. \n\n*When the people treating you like shit are your parents, you get groomed and warped into thinking like their perfect slave: independent enough to take from be it money/labor/emotional support, dependent enough to manipulate/threaten/keep in place. And you'd best be all of the contradictory needs, because they're Emotionally Immature at best and toxic or abusive at worst.*\n\nSadly, I'm seeing so many other people who have been made to feel guilty for not bowing to the often insane or contradictory demands of a selfish parent who often didn't give half as much as they expect to receive. \n\nI'd rather die or become a hermit than become like that. It disgusts me. But I can't pretend it doesn't hurt my soul too. I can understand it academically and how it effects my life and has repeatedly ruined hers, but I still cannot *fathom* treating anyone or *anything* like she does me.

Your dad is for expecting yall to uproot your lives for him yet again just because he's lonely. Why doesn't he move back? I mean your lives are there and his is else where by choice.
