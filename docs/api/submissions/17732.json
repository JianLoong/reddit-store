She had a few signature recipes that she always brought to family gatherings. One of them is a very unique dessert. I asked for the recipe for years and she would never share it. \n\nShe finally passed the recipes down to me not long before she passed away, and I made all of them to share with friends and family at the repast meal after her funeral. I also made the dessert one other time to bring to a family  gathering SIL was hosting.\n\nMy SIL loves the dessert. She keeps calling it \u201cher dessert\u201d and demanding I share the recipe with her every time we see each other. I feel like if MIL wanted her to have it she would have shared it with her, and the fact that she\u2019s already claiming the dessert as her own instead of calling it the name MIL assigned to it is disrespectful to her memory. \n\nMIL did not specifically mention whether or not she was ok with me sharing said recipes. She did also share the recipes with my stepdaughter (15) and one other grandchild (19). Both agree that I should not share the recipes with SIL. My husband thinks I\u2019m being a little petty and it\u2019s not something I should start a family feud over. This is his brother\u2019s wife and his mother\u2019s recipes so I do feel his opinion also matters. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I do feel the need to add a little context here. \n1)This is NOT my MIL\u2019s daughter.  It\u2019s her daughter in law.\n2) I wasn\u2019t bringing my stepdaughter and niece into it as support for my argument, but as proof the recipes has already been handed down to the next generation by MIL herself and I am not the only person who has it.\n3) My sister in law was not at all close with my MIL because she treated her horribly, which is most likely the reason she didn\u2019t give her the recipes. \n4) I did get one reply here that was actually constructive and I may change my mind about sharing the recipe eventually. I do realize it\u2019s not MY recipe. I feel it does belong to my husband\u2019s family. Typically I\u2019m not a recipe gatekeeper. I have shared my own late mother\u2019s recipes far and wide, including with the SIL in question. I just didn\u2019t like the way she demanded to have it and claimed it as her own instead of putting due respect on my late MIL\u2019s name.", "created_utc": 1684586397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mqwyl/aita_for_refusing_to_share_a_recipe_with_my_sil/", "score": 1414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I signed his permission slips. I made him dinner every night. I planned his homework. I got my driver's license so I could take him to school. I took him to the doctor. \n\nMy mum has now made it very clear that when she is old she wants to go to a nursing home because of the stress looking after granny had on my aunty, my mum, and me and my brother. \n\nNow, clearly, your MILs end of life wasn't like that. But I think it is *entirely fair* for your SIL to not accept that kind of responsibility, which - in a patriarchal society - would fall on her and not her husband. \n\nI don't think that constitutes her treating you MIL horribly, although i know you disagree with this opinion.

Maybe you can start building a slightly better relationship with her with that? Even if not at least she'll stop bugging you.

But NTA.", "Did you let the MIL move in with you? My father lived with us when he was dying and it was a nightmare I am still working through.", "Sorry OP, but there's far more involved than just \"giving an elderly dying woman a room in her home.\" Taking on hospice duties with a relative is a huge burden. Not to mention, in many places, if you plan on selling within 5 years you have to disclose that someone died in your home. It's not a little thing and I don't blame people for hesitating to take that on. \n\nIs this the only reason you think SIL treated MIL horribly?", "Not letting an elderly relative move in is NOT treating them horrible. Even if they have \u201ca room in her home that she was not using anyway.", "Do you understand how difficult it is to care for a dying person!? This is the most insanely petty shit I have ever read. \n\nIt's a recipe...it isn't God's own truth. Grow up and stop using a recipe as an excuse to be mean to people in your family.", "Good recipes exist to celebrate nice food and bring joy. I'm considered a very good and creative cook and I never hesitate to share some unique recipes, tips and techniques with people who ask. I would never understand those who refuse to share good recipes with their family (it's not like you a fine cuisine chef fighting with competitors for Michelin stars). It's greedy, petty, and stupid. Especially if it's not your own recipe, you personally created nothing, you're just a greedy culinary Cerberus. Listen to your husband, he's willing to share his mother's \"secret\" with his brother's family.\n\nEdited to add: YTA", "Why though? Can you please maybe disclose why they did not get along? Usually there\u2019s a reason for someone to not like someone else, it doesn\u2019t just happen out of the blue.. I mean sure, you CAN take a instant dislike for someone, but usually not without reason\u2026", "And a recipe is worth the price of a room from your SiL? You are jeopardizing a relationship with them over a recipe of a DEAD woman who no longer has an opinion.", ">I\u2019m firmly on my MIL\u2019s side because my SIL denied an elderly dying woman a room in her home that she was not using anyway\n\nYTA for this comment alone!! I have a guest room that I'm \"not using anyway\", but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be increadibly hard and inconvenient to let a dying relative move in to it! What a completely ridiculous thing to say!", "NTA, the fact that SIL treated her badly is likely why MIL didn't share it, and you would be well within the right to respect MIL by doing the same.", "Only if you\u2019re trying to make yourself look better\u2026", "SIL taking credit for a dead woman\u2019s recipe, who she didn\u2019t even care about as she was dying, is disrespectful. I guess if you\u2019re fine with the dead being maligned then there is no problem", "Ok. Good luck with hoarding \"1 cup of cocoa powder, 1 tbsp baking soda 2 cups of sugar\". Nobody on earth is gonna crack that code.", "oh wow you used \"sport\", clearly i have attracted the elites. what time is tee time?", "Are you sure?", "I have the same question, since OP has mentioned this several times.  If OP is the one making the dessert and bringing it to a gathering, how is SIL claiming it as her own?", "In another comment she says she actually did let her move in with her", "I was just going to say the same thing. I don't think anyone is wrong for not wanting to or being able to caretake a dying relative, my dad was with me for 8 years so I know what I'm talking about.", "Considering SHE took MIL in, yes she knows exactly how hard it is and is justified to judge SIL accordingly.", "It's just not important why. The only important thing is they didnt like each other. Do you want OP to recite every incident that occurred over 20 years? She probably wasn't even there for most of them. It's going down the rabbit hole for no reason.", "God you're so weirdly protective over people you don't know's \"recipes\"\n\nWhat a strange quest to have in life.", "Then SIL should have no problem making her own version of the beloved recipe, right?", "The SIL refused to help care for MIL when she was dying. She can fuck right off and find her own recipe."]}
