{"id": 17732, "submission_id": "13mqwyl", "title": "AITA for refusing to share a recipe with my SIL?", "selftext": "My beloved MIL passed away recently. She had a few signature recipes that she always brought to family gatherings. One of them is a very unique dessert. I asked for the recipe for years and she would never share it. \n\nShe finally passed the recipes down to me not long before she passed away, and I made all of them to share with friends and family at the repast meal after her funeral. I also made the dessert one other time to bring to a family  gathering SIL was hosting.\n\nMy SIL loves the dessert. She keeps calling it \u201cher dessert\u201d and demanding I share the recipe with her every time we see each other. I feel like if MIL wanted her to have it she would have shared it with her, and the fact that she\u2019s already claiming the dessert as her own instead of calling it the name MIL assigned to it is disrespectful to her memory. \n\nMIL did not specifically mention whether or not she was ok with me sharing said recipes. She did also share the recipes with my stepdaughter (15) and one other grandchild (19). Both agree that I should not share the recipes with SIL. My husband thinks I\u2019m being a little petty and it\u2019s not something I should start a family feud over. This is his brother\u2019s wife and his mother\u2019s recipes so I do feel his opinion also matters. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I do feel the need to add a little context here. \n1)This is NOT my MIL\u2019s daughter.  It\u2019s her daughter in law.\n2) I wasn\u2019t bringing my stepdaughter and niece into it as support for my argument, but as proof the recipes has already been handed down to the next generation by MIL herself and I am not the only person who has it.\n3) My sister in law was not at all close with my MIL because she treated her horribly, which is most likely the reason she didn\u2019t give her the recipes. \n4) I did get one reply here that was actually constructive and I may change my mind about sharing the recipe eventually. I do realize it\u2019s not MY recipe. I feel it does belong to my husband\u2019s family. Typically I\u2019m not a recipe gatekeeper. I have shared my own late mother\u2019s recipes far and wide, including with the SIL in question. I just didn\u2019t like the way she demanded to have it and claimed it as her own instead of putting due respect on my late MIL\u2019s name.\n\nFinal edit: I\u2019m going to answer a few questions and try my best to set a few things straight, then I\u2019m gonna turn notifications off. First of all thank you to everyone who gave constructive feedback! Also, thank you to the people who understood the sentimental value of these recipes. Some of you gave me some good ideas for how and when I want to share the recipes, and yes, I do plan on sharing them. \n\nFirst of all, yes, my niece (19) is SIL\u2019s stepdaughter. BIL, SIL and 19 are on a timeout right now. I will not go any further into that, than to say it doesn\u2019t relate to this post. SIL is well aware of the name of the dessert, and who all the recipes were shared with. I have not clearly communicated how offend I am over her claiming the dessert as her own, but I do plan on having the conversation privately.\n\nThat said, my SIL is not a terrible person. I actually do love her too, and have shared many many recipes with her and she with me. Water under the bridge between her and MIL had nothing to do with me. My husband is reading this thread also and wanted me to make it clear that we don\u2019t hate each other! We honestly believes she was given a difficult choice to make, but she did the right thing, even thought it was hurtful to MIL. She wound up where she was supposed to be! He also would like for it to be known that his mother was sometimes intentionally difficult. (In case that wasn\u2019t obvious! Lol!) He says that he believes she ultimately left the decision up to me because she trusted me to do the right thing. I believe sharing the recipes the right way could be a wholesome way of healing some generational trauma, and may be the best way to honor her legacy of love.", "created_utc": 1684586397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mqwyl/aita_for_refusing_to_share_a_recipe_with_my_sil/", "score": 5812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s meant to be enjoyed and shared. If it\u2019s actually an original recipe by MIL, wouldn\u2019t OP want the recipe to live on and be enjoyed by future generations?

I do feel petty for refusing to give the recipe to her. I think I will eventually, though. It\u2019s not about me being better than her and I do want my BIL to be able to enjoy having his wife make his mother\u2019s recipe. It just really bothered me that a) she demanded only one of the three recipes because that was the only one she personally liked.

If this was an at piece, a written story, or many other things where a person took time and worked on it, then it was plagiarized, stolen and claimed as someone else's we'd be criminalizing that person. But somehow making recipes is seen as less than others forms of work? So it's OK to steal this from the memory of the MIL?", "Yea, So silly tbh. I think we shouldn't pass down this type of shit to gatekeepe stuff like our parents beleived in, it's ridiculous.", "YTA, all information should be democratized.

Do you expect a wedding dress designer to give away a dress?  Or a car manufacturer?  Or a home builder?\n\nSomeone who has taken the time, effort and supplies to create a signature recipe deserves to decide who gets access to it.  \n\nIf SIL wants to, she can sit in her danged kitchen and experiment until she figures it out.  OP is under no obligation to share and is NTA for not doing so", "What a presumptuous and disrespectful thing to say. Grandma was obviously specific with who she gave her secrets to.

It was polite later to give recipes of your own. If there wasn't a new person in the neighborhood in awhile, there would be a recipe-swap and a potluck. It was just an excuse to gather and refresh the old recipe boxes.\n\nI moved to a place where asking for the recipe is absolutely NOT considered a compliment to the cook!

She would have had peace and privacy there. Instead she was forced to move in with us. I\u2019m glad she did because I know we took excellent care of her for the last year she was alive, but we were forced to move 2 of our children into our own bedroom to accommodate all of this. We are foster parents, and we do have a special needs child also. Our house is very loud, crowded and chaotic. Not exactly an ideal environment for an elderly person suffering with a lot of seriously health problems. SIL never once came to visit MIL in that entire year. That was also very hurtful to MIL.

We keep making her recipes but *her* food passed with her.

Granny was scared and angry that a \"stranger\" saw her in the condition and that deeply affected my aunty. \n\nGranny had significant care needs that my aunty was not trained or qualified to address. Then not only affected my aunty, but it also affected my cousins, who were put secondary to my high needs granny. My cousins was about 13 at the time and she recalls her parents having to leave multiple personally important events because they needed to look after granny first. There was nothing wrong with that, of course, but it affected her self esteem and relationship with her parents. \n\nMum then moved back to home country for 6 months until granny died. **at 17 Years old** I had to care for my 13 year old brother. I signed his permission slips. I made him dinner every night. I planned his homework. I got my driver's license so I could take him to school. I took him to the doctor. \n\nMy mum has now made it very clear that when she is old she wants to go to a nursing home because of the stress looking after granny had on my aunty, my mum, and me and my brother. \n\nNow, clearly, your MILs end of life wasn't like that. But I think it is *entirely fair* for your SIL to not accept that kind of responsibility, which - in a patriarchal society - would fall on her and not her husband. \n\nI don't think that constitutes her treating you MIL horribly, although i know you disagree with this opinion.

Maybe you can start building a slightly better relationship with her with that? Even if not at least she'll stop bugging you.

It holds everything together better and gives that creamy texture I'm a fan of. Some people like the icing sugar more but I find the biggest complaint is it hurts people's teeth and it's almost too sweet (which is why it's used more as a decorative add on and not a binding ingredient)\n\nAlso if you're a fan of nut bars I recommend 5 layer bars, as they are also called \"crack\" in my house.

So she made kind of a recipe booklet(Simple home made) and gave away to people she knew who wanted them.\n\nWhen she passed away there was a news article about her passing and in the comment section of it on Facebook, people would talk about her food and there were people who asked for recipes of her old dishes.", "YES. Love that even the husband is calling her petty...", "It's worth noting that this isn't an unusual thing in cultures/groups where family recipies are maintained and passed down. If you're the DIL you ask for years while cooking and helping alongside your MIL, because if she was going to give them to you immediately upon marrying in then she would have already. This is usually done while working alongside your MIL to help cook other things, getting to know her, etc. It can seem kind of power trippy, but it's more of a...showing her that you'll treasure them and keep her memory alive using them thing? The same way that if you particularily love an item your MIL owns and have made that clear in a non-entitled way, she's more likely to pass it to you in her will.\n\nNow, the SIL doesn't seem to have gone through the process of getting to know the MIL, earning her respect, and being bestowed the recipies. Why exactly there's friction between them we don't know, but it's entirely possible the SIL just...didn't want to, made limited effort, and didn't participate. In which case she's not asking for something she should have gotten, and is closer to being that person who found out that another child/spouse got a better settlement in the will because they were going around to spend time with and help and love their ailing relative and being pissed because they feel entitled to the same thing despite having called maybe once every few months for five minutes and acting snippy with them on their death bed.\n\nSo no, it's not the same thing. The OP spent years showing her MIL that her recipies would be well used and carried on if they were passed down to her. The SIL spent that time not doing that, and has since her MIL's death shown OP that she doesn't care to build a relationship but wants the fruits that building that relationship would have given her.\n\nObviously it depends on context we don't have to a degree (there are situations where the MIL would be behaving unreasonably) but there's a difference between gatekeeping something and safeguarding a treasured piece of your inheritence from your departed family.", "Half the stuff I make doesn't even have a recipe.

If you pass it on or share it with anyone, you want to have a connection with that person, and also know that they will care for the recipe in the same way you did.  They'll honor where it came from, how it was created, and why it is so special.  In this case, the MIL didn't share likely until she felt that way with those that she did ultimately share with.  The SIL obviously did not have that connection, and obviously doesn't respect where it came from (it's hers already without even having it yet).

But I swear this is the most delicious bowl of food you might ever have, even if it is a few days' total effort. \n\nFirst -- Pinto Beans (Night Before and Day One):\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 lbs dry pinto beans\n* 1 smoked ham hock\n* 2 Spanish Onions, diced\n* 5 Cloves of Garlic, crushed and chopped\n* 4 Cups Chicken Broth\n* S & P to taste\n* Water\n* 2 tbsp Sweet Paprika\n* 1/2 tbsp Smoked Paprika\n* 1.5 tbsp Cumin - divided\n* 1 tsp Garlic Powder\n* 1 tsp Onion Powder\n* 1\\2 tsp Ground Oregano\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 4 tbsp butter\n\nThe night before, right before bedtime, pick through the pinto beans removing any rocks or mangled beans, then empty the dry beans into a very large bowl. Fill almost full with water ensuring the beans are covered by several inches of water.\n\nThe next morning, drain the beans, rinse them, and set aside.\n\nIn a large pot melt the butter. Once it is foaming, dump in the onion and cook until the onions soften but aren't browning yet. Add the garlic and cook a minute longer. Then, dump in all of the spices (only 1 tbsp of the Cumin), stir those around for 20-30 seconds, and add the smoked ham hock. Then, add the beans, dump in the chicken broth, and add water until you cover the beans and ham hock.\n\nBring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cover. Check periodically to be sure too much water isn't boiling off. Add more as necessary. It'll take about 90 minutes at a simmer until the ham hock is ready to fall apart. When it is, carefully remove it to another bowl and using forks or tongs and a fork take it apart, removing any bones and the excess layer of fat. Retain the meat, shred it coarsely (don't be too neat about it, leave some bigger but still bite-sized pieces), and add it back to the beans.\n\nContinue on low until the beans are tender (about another half hour depending on altitute and other factors). Stir in the last 1/2 tbsp of Cumin and salt to taste.\n\nCool quickly and refrigerate overnight, but obviously have a bowl of beans for dinner or a snack... quality control is important. ;)\n\nSecond -- Hamburger Meat (Day Two):\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 lbs hamburger meat (not too lean, ground chuck is great).\n* 1 Spanish Onion\n* 3 Cloves of Garlic Minced\n* 28 ounces of diced tomatoes, undrained (you could use Rotel. I like to use roasted, diced tomatoes).  \n* 1 tbsp Cumin\n* 1 tbsp Sweet Paprika\n* 1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika\n* 1 tbsp Chile Powder (not too spicy, like Ancho maybe)\n* 2 tbsp Butter\n\nMelt the butter in a large skillet, and then add the onion. When the onion is soft, add the garlic. Cook another minute, and then move those all to the side of the skillet and add the hamburger meat. Brown the hamburger meat, and when the moisture has mostly cooked off, add in the spices, stir those around, and then add in the tomatoes. Stir, reduce to simmer, and cook until it's thickened a bit and the excess liquid has simmered off.\n\nThen, making sure there's enough room in your pot for it, carefully dump the hamburger meat & tomatoes into the beans. Stir to combine, check seasoning, and let it simmer for a half hour or so just to let the flavors marry. \n\nThis recipe can be easily halved. It's best served with warm, freshly baked (unsweetened) cornbread made with white corn flour instead of yellow. \n\nI like to crumble my cornbread up in the bowl and ladle the beans over it, then stir it all together.\n\nAnd thank you for your kind words.", "Personally, I think that now more than ever it's important to share family recipes.

And we all know how much care men in these situations give --ahem. Zero.). SIL would rather care for her OWN mother.

Yikes to all of you", "YTA.  \nSIL (or even anyone who eats something - related or not) is not wrong to ask for a recipe.    \nSIL calling it \"her dessert\" could mean different things.  If SIL is saying it as another way of saying that it is her FAVORITE dessert, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  If SIL is saying it as a way of claiming that it is HER dessert (as in she created the recipe), I do think there's something wrong with that.  (I don't like it & think it is dishonest.  But I also know it is a fairly common thing for some people to do - so I'm sure she's not the first person to do it without a second thought.)  \nI think that SIL's attempt to rename the recipe to be distasteful - but I don't know that that was a deliberate attempt to be distasteful or an unfortunate personality quirk.  If it was a true attempt to rename the dessert, I think it means that SIL probably did mean \"her dessert\" to mean she will attempt to claim it as her own.  BUT - if MIL was deliberately difficult when dealing with SIL, SIL probably doesn't have fond memories of MIL.  (I know I wouldn't if someone had deliberately made my life difficult.)    \nI can totally understand SIL wanting the recipe for a dessert she likes - but also wanting to not be reminded of someone who deliberately made her life difficult every time she makes it.  That gives her a much better excuse than most for renaming a recipe & calling it her own.  So given those 2 primary offenses that you sited, I don't think SIL is the AH.  \nIf I understand correctly, you were given the recipe by MIL after her death (like an inheritance) without any stipulations attached.  If that is correct, you do not have to try to ascertain what MIL would or would not have wanted.  Since she did not provide any stipulations with the recipe(s), she obviously left the recipe(s) as a gift to you to do with as you pleased.    \nYou say that your SIL is a good person & that you love her.  For me, that would be enough.    \nYou say that you felt her actions were disrespectful to your MIL's memory - but your own husband (MIL's own son) state that she was deliberately difficult in her dealings with SIL.  It is not reasonable to expect SIL to respect the memory of MIL when it seems evident that MIL did not respect SIL while she was alive.  (Would you respect someone who was \"deliberately difficult\" to you?  I wouldn't.)  \nYou also state that your husband (MIL's own son) believes that you should share the recipe.  As your spouse & MIL's son, I think his opinion does matter.  However, the 2 teenage granddaughters' opinions really mean nothing.  It seems like you only shared their opinions since it supported yours.    \nUnless you want to continue your MIL's legacy by being deliberately difficult in dealing with SIL, there is nothing to be gained by not sharing the recipe(s).  MIL's memory is not \"honored\" by withholding the recipe.  I think you're annoyed with SIL for the reasons you stated - so you're using MIL's dislike of SIL when she was alive as an excuse to withhold the recipe from SIL.  So YTA.      \nIf you truly want to \"honor\" MIL's memory & want to use a recipe (or several recipes) to do it, create a \"Insert\\_MIL's\\_Last\\_Name\\_Here Family Cookbook\".  Gather all the recipes that she shared with you in it (as well as any other family recipe(s) that you &/or other family members want to add), type each of them out & even add a photo of any/all of the dishes that you want, get all of them bound & have copies reprinted for whomever would like one.    \nTHAT would be a fitting way to honor a woman who loved cooking & recipes that would also bring the family together in a positive way.", "Best solution: Post it online and give her the link.", "Agree.
