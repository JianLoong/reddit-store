{"id": 17732, "submission_id": "13mqwyl", "title": "AITA for refusing to share a recipe with my SIL?", "selftext": "My beloved MIL passed away recently. She had a few signature recipes that she always brought to family gatherings. One of them is a very unique dessert. I asked for the recipe for years and she would never share it. \n\nShe finally passed the recipes down to me not long before she passed away, and I made all of them to share with friends and family at the repast meal after her funeral. I also made the dessert one other time to bring to a family  gathering SIL was hosting.\n\nMy SIL loves the dessert. She keeps calling it \u201cher dessert\u201d and demanding I share the recipe with her every time we see each other. I feel like if MIL wanted her to have it she would have shared it with her, and the fact that she\u2019s already claiming the dessert as her own instead of calling it the name MIL assigned to it is disrespectful to her memory. \n\nMIL did not specifically mention whether or not she was ok with me sharing said recipes. She did also share the recipes with my stepdaughter (15) and one other grandchild (19). Both agree that I should not share the recipes with SIL. My husband thinks I\u2019m being a little petty and it\u2019s not something I should start a family feud over. This is his brother\u2019s wife and his mother\u2019s recipes so I do feel his opinion also matters. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I do feel the need to add a little context here. \n1)This is NOT my MIL\u2019s daughter.  It\u2019s her daughter in law.\n2) I wasn\u2019t bringing my stepdaughter and niece into it as support for my argument, but as proof the recipes has already been handed down to the next generation by MIL herself and I am not the only person who has it.\n3) My sister in law was not at all close with my MIL because she treated her horribly, which is most likely the reason she didn\u2019t give her the recipes. \n4) I did get one reply here that was actually constructive and I may change my mind about sharing the recipe eventually. I do realize it\u2019s not MY recipe. I feel it does belong to my husband\u2019s family. Typically I\u2019m not a recipe gatekeeper. I have shared my own late mother\u2019s recipes far and wide, including with the SIL in question. I just didn\u2019t like the way she demanded to have it and claimed it as her own instead of putting due respect on my late MIL\u2019s name.", "created_utc": 1684586397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mqwyl/aita_for_refusing_to_share_a_recipe_with_my_sil/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That alone is reason enough to keep it to yourself.", "NTA. MIL shared the recipes with three people. She wasn't one of them", "NTA.\n\nSIL is being pushy; don't reward her aggression.\n\nIf MIL wanted her to have the recipe, she would have bestowed it on her. She gave it to three people and no others, so that's how she wanted it to go down.\n\nYour husband is really wrong; he should back you up. And you aren't starting a family feud. SIL is.\n\nIt's interesting, though, to see a MIL called \"beloved.\" That happens very rarely hereabouts.", "YTA\nGatekeeping family recipes is petty and childish. Does it make you feel important somehow? I don't get this, people post this topic frequently. \n\nI think you're being rude and on some kind of power trip. It's not very nice.", "NTA\n\nit's very funny how people guard certain recipes. \n\nI was very close to my grandparents on my bio father's side. as a result, my grandmother left me her recipe books and cards. she was one of those people who do NOT share recipes. so, for her to have left them to me was pretty special. \n\nmy bio sister had bugged me for a bit for them, so did some cousins. I felt the same way though. if she'd wanted those people to have them, she would've given them copies. \n\nso, nuts to them. so I feel the exact same way. if your MIL had wanted people to have those recipes, she would've shared. it seemed she did, to a VERY select few people.", "Hmmm this is difficult to be honest, perhaps NAH", "NTA SIL had the chance to endear herself with her MIL while she was alive. Instead, as per OPs comments, she treated MIL very poorly indeed.\n\nDue to her behaviour to MIL whilst she was still alive, I do not think it's petty to refuse her demands.\n\nPerhaps OP could revisit this decision if SIL can accept that her behaviour was bad and apologises for it.\n\nI think this would be a good president to show MILs granddaughters who were also given recipes.", "YTA. It's a recipe. Do you think MIL wants her recipes  to die with you? Or do you plan on waiting for your death bed to pass them on to only a special selected person.\n\nIt's literally food, and likely similar versions of what you made can be found through various cooking websites. Hell, maybe even the same exact one.\n\nStop gatekeeping. Her own daughter wants to make a dessert her mother used to make, not set fire to a valuable family heirloom.", "YTA. What changes in your life if SIL knows the recipe? No recipe is a total secret, it's already out there somewhere. Having 2 teenagers agree with you is not the flex you think it is. There is no one pettier than those who insist on hoarding recipes. Recipes are to share food, sharing food is sharing love, you cook for those you love.\n\nGet over having one up on SIL and just share the recipe. It will not change your life.", "YTA. Oh lord share the recipe. Food isn't meant to be a tool of control and exclusion, It's meant to be a means of spreading joy and love.", "YTA. What us big deal with \u201csecret\u201d recipes?  There are plenty of recipes, and a fair cook should be able to create near replicate or an improved one anyway.", "***YTA*** this is incredibly petty.\n\nThis is *food*, not money, jewels and real estate.\n\nLook at it this way, you would be SPREADING her memory further and wider by sharing the recipes.   Hell, you could even ASK people to mention your MIL whenever they made any of these dishes.   This way people (including your SIL) would understand how much this woman and her recipes mean to you and meant to *her*.", "Your beloved MIL shared her most incredible creation with you: her son and your husband. I'm glad you specified that his opinion matters. I think it would be wise to listen to him.\n\nTalk to your SIL, tell her what this recipe and your MIL means/meant to you and ask her to make a good-faith deal: if you share it, will she make you a promise to always give credit where credit is due? (i.e., you need her to agree to honour your MIL when she serves it.)\n\nI'm of the opinion that every time someone makes this recipe, shares it, and enjoys eating it, your MIL is honoured and her memory kept alive. Don't limit that.\n\nStop being TA.\n\nEdit to add: the teens in your family aren't in position to bring wisdom to this issue. Set the trend", "Recipe gatekeeping is pathetic and the highest form of petty. YTA", "NAH\n\nShe asked for her mother's recipe to make a dish she loves. \n\nYou don't have to oblige.", "YTA.  \n\nThis is so petty.  Stop gatekeeping recipes.   Nobody is disrespecting your MILs memory.", "YTA. Most of the beloved recipes I have inherited from my grandmother were from an old magazine or church cookbook. If I want a recipe now, I just google it.", "Jesus Christ, share the damn recipe. It\u2019s a RECIPE not the nuclear codes. What needless drama.\nYTA", "YTA. Good god, it's a recipe. This is ridiculous.", "ESH- When someone marries into a family, they become part of that family. While you and your MIL have/had every right to do what you will with that recipe, why specifically exclude that particular person? This seems like a power play to show \"rank\" in the family, and that's messed up. I will grant that SIL outright demanding the recipe repeatedly is, at best, impolite and, at worst, rude. However,  the dynamic that set the precedent to make her feel left out in the first place likely didn't help.", "I'm gonna say esh. I don't agree with the recipe gatekeeper. But to be honest, if I was in your shoes and she was claiming it as her own, I'd be feeling petty to. But the key word here is petty. It's still petty. I think sil sucks for that, but you suck fo gatekeeping. \n\nAs a suggestion that could maybe make everyone happy, maybe give her the recipe but omit something that is not crucial or incredibly important from the recipe. Say margarine instead of butter without her aware. I know that's petty as well.", "NTA. If she wanted her to have the recipe then she\u2019d know it right along with you and the granddaughters. Keep it private", "YTA. You're stopping a grieving daughter-in-law from honoring her other in a way that would mean a lot to her.", "YTA,  if your husband believes you should share the recipes then you should share the recipes, it is his mother, who also was the mother of your BIL. Your SIL shares the same status as you in the family both DILs ' and stop asking other family members their opinion on said recipes you are making it into a family drama,  they are recipes!", "YTA. It's a recipe and your MIL did not swear you to secrecy. \n\nSounds like your SIL didn't even know about the dessert until you made it so never had the chance to ask your MIL for it.
