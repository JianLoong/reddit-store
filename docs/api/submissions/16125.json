One of the main reasons I chose this place was because my bedroom faced east, allowing me to wake up to the morning sunlight. Most mornings I wake up before my alarm goes off just because the sunlight coming through the window waking me up. There used to be a treeline that provided a natural barrier between my house and any potential neighbors, so I never saw the need for curtains or blinds along with they are expensive as hell for the nice ones.\n\nRecently my neighborhood expanded and most of the treeline my bedroom was facing was cut down to build new houses. So boom, then there's a house was built right across from mine, and their window has a clear view into my bedroom.\n\nI've always been comfortable sleeping nude, and it wasn't an issue when there were no neighbors around. But not long after the people moved in the father from the house came over to my house and pretty much told me to stop being nude in front of my windows since his family can see inside my bedroom. He wasn't nice about it. But, he wasn't mean either just matter of factly like he gave me an order a fully expected it to be done like I was his kid or his employee. I was somewhat surprised but understood his concern, so I made an effort to be more mindful of my nudity when in view of the window. I stopped cleaning and making my bed before getting dressed. I'd hop out of bed walk into my closet and at least put on shorts then go about my morning chores.\n\nThat being said, I still sleep nude, and I occasionally end up being visible to the neighbors for a brief moment after waking up. The father came over again, leading to an argument between us. I told him I was trying my best to be considerate, but there's only so much I can do and that it's my house and I'm not changing my lifestyle because they moved in. He threatened to call the police and said I was being a \"menace to the neighborhood\" whatever the hell that means.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for continuing to sleep nude even though my neighbors can see into my bedroom?", "created_utc": 1682949526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134n8ef/aita_for_continuing_to_sleep_nude_despite_my/", "score": 10054, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I phoned and visited regularly; it was just part of our routine where she would complain. After each time I reminded her it was a 2-way street, I'm pretty certain she phoned a different grand kid. She needed the reminder; she felt guilty disturbing people her entire life.

And yes, I just looked away and we mostly laughed at them, but it was never the best start to my day.\n\nESH - your neighbour is being way over the top, but you could definitely do more.

Mild YTA because it seems pretty easy to get what you want without presenting yourself to the world.\n\nPlus, for people telling you there's nothing the police can do about it, they're absolutely wrong. Technically, (at least where I'm from) you would not be committing something like indecent exposure because you're not doing it for sexual pleasure.

Whether adult or children neighbors especially with nakedness, isn't it just kind to be mindful of your own actions affecting others?  I don't think the neighbor is peeping. At any point kids in the neighborhood could look up and see you so putting up neighbor curtains doesn't solve that issue. But as someone said, especially at night with lights on or bright sun in morning, your eye is naturally drawn to light.

We all share space where we live.  If you lived on acreage with no neighbors, then this behavior -- have at it.  But you are affecting others OUTSIDE of your home.

I would take issue with it as well. If he insisted on continuing, I'd probably get the police involved. Just bc it is your property doesn't mean it isn't indecent exposure.

There is a solution where OP could go back to his completely nude morning routine AND his neighbor is happy if OP were to obscure at least the bottom of the window but everyone acts like that's the most offensive thing ever and it's ridiculous. If the concern is cost, talk to the neighbor and ask that they buy obscuring film since they have the issue but to act like OP can do absolutely nothing to compromise and the neighbor just shouldn't look out their window or put up blinds is dumb and I wouldn't want to be neighbors with anyone agreeing with that logic.\n\nPeople go out of their way to do favors for others all the time so this logic of \"it's their issue so they should deal with it\" falls apart pretty much instantly.

Kids will sometimes just peek out a window because of whatever, and if OP is doing something like that, it will definitely land him on the list. I'd rather OP not take reddit advice saying this is a hill to die on (because he'd have to pay thousands and miss work and whatnot just to be declared innocent or guilty and end up on the list potentially) rather than 10-20 maybe more on something like that frost film people suggested", "\u2026except law enforcement doesn\u2019t put anyone on the sex offenders registry, a conviction puts you on the registry. This would come down to local laws. If I was Op I would be calling the local PD about peeping neighbors who watch him while he\u2019s nude in his bedroom.", "I really like this option. Lol", "Why does law matter? Should this family have to decide between keeping windows shuttered all morning and seeing a naked guy? Making a choice for comfort can mean giving up something else, that's the price to pay for living in a society.", "In most jurisdictions this can be considered indecent exposure, especially with minor children involved OP could find himself on a sex offender registry.", "Finally, someone being reasonable. The people claiming OP is just fine and that the neighbor shouldn't be allowed to look out his own windows... good lord. \n\nThis is why many cities and counties have local ordinances for privacy hedges and such.", "I understand and agree when we are talking about someone moving into a property and forcing a new situation on the neighborhood.\n\nIn this instance, the house next door was built up after they moved in, and what was once their private space is no longer so. \n\nThe law is the law, but it's a little bullshit that people think OP should have to pay to rectify the fact that their private space is no longer private due to neighboring construction.  The neighbors moved in later: OP was being nude in their own household well before.\n\nNot to mention: it's just nudity. It's also bullshit that nakedness is an issue in the first place.", "It\u2019s common courtesy to not spy on neighbors. Also seeing someone naked for 3 seconds never killed anyone"]}
