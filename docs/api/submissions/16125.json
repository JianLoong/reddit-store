One of the main reasons I chose this place was because my bedroom faced east, allowing me to wake up to the morning sunlight. Most mornings I wake up before my alarm goes off just because the sunlight coming through the window waking me up. There used to be a treeline that provided a natural barrier between my house and any potential neighbors, so I never saw the need for curtains or blinds along with they are expensive as hell for the nice ones.\n\nRecently my neighborhood expanded and most of the treeline my bedroom was facing was cut down to build new houses. So boom, then there's a house was built right across from mine, and their window has a clear view into my bedroom.\n\nI've always been comfortable sleeping nude, and it wasn't an issue when there were no neighbors around. But not long after the people moved in the father from the house came over to my house and pretty much told me to stop being nude in front of my windows since his family can see inside my bedroom. He wasn't nice about it. But, he wasn't mean either just matter of factly like he gave me an order a fully expected it to be done like I was his kid or his employee. I was somewhat surprised but understood his concern, so I made an effort to be more mindful of my nudity when in view of the window. I stopped cleaning and making my bed before getting dressed. I'd hop out of bed walk into my closet and at least put on shorts then go about my morning chores.\n\nThat being said, I still sleep nude, and I occasionally end up being visible to the neighbors for a brief moment after waking up. The father came over again, leading to an argument between us. I told him I was trying my best to be considerate, but there's only so much I can do and that it's my house and I'm not changing my lifestyle because they moved in. He threatened to call the police and said I was being a \"menace to the neighborhood\" whatever the hell that means.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for continuing to sleep nude even though my neighbors can see into my bedroom?", "created_utc": 1682949526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134n8ef/aita_for_continuing_to_sleep_nude_despite_my/", "score": 1048, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And yes, I just looked away and we mostly laughed at them, but it was never the best start to my day.\n\nESH - your neighbour is being way over the top, but you could definitely do more.

Technically, (at least where I'm from) you would not be committing something like indecent exposure because you're not doing it for sexual pleasure.
