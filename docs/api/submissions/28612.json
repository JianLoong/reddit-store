He was literally my best friend.  16 months ago he met a girl on a dating app and fell head over heels for her.\n\n He texted her for 30 days, then met her in person and 30 days later they got married. I had told him this was a bad idea because he has a history of being impulsive, which has gotten worse in the last few years ever since his parents sold their house, and he did not want to live with them where they chose to retire to. He cannot afford his own place, whether it be a house or an apartment.  \n\nSo once he married this girl, he became very insistent that I spend time with her. He never invited me to any event. I never turned him down. It seemed that I had to initiate everything. For context, about seven months before this happened I lost my last remaining parent, and I was still struggling with that. So I told him that I was not in a place where I could entertain a new person and give them a fair chance multiple times. This is not what he wanted so he continued to press me to spend time with her. \n\nEventually to make this stop, I told him to pick a  time, date and place and we would do what he wanted. He did pick it, but then he canceled on it the night before and said it might be better for us to just have a phone call to get to know each other. I didn\u2019t wanna do that either because I didn\u2019t feel up to it with everything that was going on for me, but I did do it. \n\nDuring the phone call his new wife asked me questions because now that the dust had settled and the excitement had gone she was concerned that she had made a mistake.  She started the conversation with the statement that she was concerned that he settled for her so he didn\u2019t have to be on dating apps, and then proceeded to ask questions. I answered those questions honestly and it turns out he was caught in a lie. Both him and his immediate family have ostracized me since then, as if this is solely my fault.
