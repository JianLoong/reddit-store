I cook, I clean, I help my kid with homework, etc. I've been bugging her to move out for a few months now. \n\nIn May, she decided to go on vacation (by herself) for what was supposed to be less than 2 weeks. Me and my kid are at home, having a good time, but then the day she's supposed to come back rolls around and she's no show. Then a few more days. During this time she's messaged her daughter once, me never, and her mom is calling me to find out where she is. \n\nI eventually get a hold of her and she says she'll be home late the next day. Well that day rolls around and she's a no show again. At this point I'm just tired of her immaturity and I phone her Mom and Dad and tell them they need to come load up and move everything that's hers out of my house and move it to either a storage unit or their house. \n\nWell eventually she decides to grace us with her presence after nearly 4 weeks of being gone. At this point I've had to cancel things I had planned and all of her stuff has been relocated to her parents place. She loses her shit (understandably) and says I'm abusive and had no right to have her stuff moved. \n\nEventually she calls her parents and gets a ride to their house. I don't appreciate my home being used as free storage for someone ungrateful like her. And I don't think her vacation was fair to me, her daughter, or her family.

She's had half a year to move out. She's taking advantage of you. Not paying anything, but does go on a vacation. Has 50% custody but is not doing anything for or with her daughter. Is irresponsible.... She had it coming. Wonder if you can't get 100% custody if she keeps this up, doesn't sound like she's interested in being a good mother.", "NTA What kind of shady nonsense is she up to that she disappears like that?  Does she have a job?", "NTA\n\nGood for you.", "NTA. You were being used and will be if you allow her back. Hold your ground.", "NTA. She lived off of you, you paid child support while your kid had everything they needed and didn't leave your home. She then took a month long vacation (using the child support) and acts like you're the bad guy? WTF", "NTA. Responsible adults make their plans known and responsible, caring parents don\u2019t just disappear on their kids. While you all knew she was going on a trip, she indicated the duration and then didn\u2019t come back for weeks after she was due. That\u2019s unnecessary stress for everyone, including the child. If she\u2019s really not doing anything for her kid and acting like this, I think it\u2019s time to speak with your attorney about sole custody. \n\nAlso, see about changing the locks if you haven\u2019t already. Your attorney should be able to tell you if you\u2019re allowed to just do that on your own or if you have to formally evict her.", "NTA the next time she disappears file for abandonment and go for full custody.

Must have been destabilizing for your daughter not knowing when her mother was coming home.", "NTA. And you managed to dislodge your ex from you house without her putting up a fight. Oh, that's right. She was on an extended vacation. You should have told her You snooze You lose :D", "NTA\n\nyour only abusive and controlling when you cant be manipulated.", "NTA... she is still a parent.

In what way is she supporting these children? It sounds like it's funding her vacations.", "She was shitty for sure. But she may not \u201ctechnically\u201d have abandoned the child.

Imho I think OP has already been far too nice. I can't believe OP was paying his ex child support while she was still living with him and pawning all the childcare onto him. OP should have thrown her out after the first month of child support was paid and ex refused to parent, even if he had to evict her. It's really making me think that mom's little get away was likely funded largely with banked child support.", "She works with a family member.
