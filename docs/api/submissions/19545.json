OP should have thrown her out after the first month of child support was paid and ex refused to parent, even if he had to evict her.

This might not be enough of a pattern to change things, but if you're paying child support based on the idea of a 50/50 split in custody time and she refuses to adhere to that, you might qualify for a reduction in what you pay, if the child is with you for more than half the time.", "NTA, you\u2019re already a saint for doing as much as you did", "NTA.

And then making several promises that she kept missing without good reason or warning, just not replying and not showing up. Thats not a grey area or anything.", "Yeah, 'child abandonment' is probably getting into really sticky territory, because to me, that sounds like something you get the cops or CPS in. Refusing to show up for your custody time is a civil matter. I do think that OP should document all of this and bring it to his lawyer, though. If a parent refuses to use their custody time, then that can be grounds to reduce it. And if OP is parenting the child for more than 50% of the time, then he should definitely qualify for a child support reduction (or, depending on their relative incomes, she might be required to pay him child support).", "Emotional abandonment, or using the common version of the word, you're 100% correct. She's a neglectful mother who abandoned her kid, unless OP is leaving something major out of the facts. I think that the push-back on the use of the word is that when you say 'technically she abandoned her child' is that it can read like the person meant the legal definition of child abandonment, which usually doesn't apply when you leave the child with the other parent. I think the pushback is because she probably can't go to jail for her actions.\n\nHowever, I do think OP should talk to his lawyer, because if he's paying child support based on 50/50 custody, but in reality he's got custody for a much greater period of time, then that's grounds to change the parenting plan. One month might not be enough to establish a pattern, but his lawyer will know what would do it.", "Picking them up to where? They all live together in one house. I don't think you can file abandonment really when you all live together and children are with their parent. People have business trips for example and it's not abandonment.\n\nAnd I don't think they really have custody days because they all live together. It's not like you aren't allowed to speak to your child in your house when it's not your day.", "No if you 'go out for milk' and never return then it's still abandonment no matter if your spouse was still at home when you left. Really no way to twist or turn that. Sure, eventually she came home. But it's not like she overslept or forgot to pick up her kids one day and arrived later that night or whatever. There is absolutely NO grey area on whether or not this is child abandonment.", "Change the locks NTA", "NTA, and just FYI, sometimes the abusive partner calls the victim abuser.\n\nI'm not sure why you let that go on for so long.

Also many employees done take advantage as they think we'll the time off is there if I want it so they just work a lot more.", "Interesting, I'm not in States, it's different here. Thanks!", "Most 50/50 custody splits are every other week or every 2 weeks. This is most likely their case as well. Doesn't matter if she lives in the same house or not. Her not being preset during her custody time because she was on a vacation is in violation of a court order and the dad can move for full custody.", "The theory behind it is not to have too big of a discrepancy between each parents home. Ex., mom makes more money and can afford a 3bd 2bath + gaming systems/nicer clothes/food etc, but dad can only afford a 1bd and thrift store clothes, no streaming services or games, food bank food, thus the kids are more likely to prefer moms house. Mileage varies in reality but that's the idea", "You want to talk moral vs legal, sure she bailed and abandoned them.

It was stated that he had asked her to move out several times.", "Well not picked them up per se, but picked up some responsibilities. Just because they lived together doesn't mean that she can just disregard when it's her time to watch the kids. Sure, you can ask the other parent to pick up her slack even in a time period where its primarily her own responsibility but he isn't obligated to do so and he didnt agree to have sole responsibly for them for more than 2 weeks. She was away for 4.", "Oh, yeah, it makes no sense in this specific situation. I was just explaining in the general sense \ud83d\ude05", "So, to be clear, I'm not trying to start an argument. I was just following the conversation thread where someone said 'technically she abandoned the child', someone else chimed in with the point that in some places legal criteria on what qualifies as abandonment differ, and you stated that it was still abandonment. I was just clarifying the point of distinction between you and the previous commenter. \n\nMorally, ethically, all of those measures, this is abandonment. I agree fully. It would be very harmful for a child, especially one whose mother lives in her house with her, to suddenly have her mother disappear without a single word for a month, even if she still had her other parent. I am not defending this woman. But legally, depending on the jurisdiction, she might not qualify for criminal charges. \n\nThis woman abandoned her child, regardless of how the law views it. I agree with you on that.", "Yes there is. Because not showing up for 24hrs is not the same as not showing up for 6 months. When you don\u2019t show up for months then you have grounds to file for termination of rights.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t show up for 2 days and left the kids with their father, it\u2019s shitty but not abandonment. If she left the kids home alone unsupervised, it is.\n\nAnd yes there\u2019s gray areas because what does and doesn\u2019t constitute as abandonment is going to vary. The rules in each state is going to be different.

I also don't know how a court would look at this regarding custody change, but the truth is that during her scheduled time she was away and unreachable.", "And when she didn't move out he didn't call the police or whatever is the procedure in his area, so court can easily see it as him allowing her to stay or changing his mind or trying to recover relationship.\nAnd it will depend on if they actually have any schedule.

Your ex has proven herself to be selfish, unreliable, and uninterested in being a mother to her kid. I would be concerned that the kid will feel like she isn't wanted by her mom when with her, the kid's school work will suffer, and your ex may use the child support money for herself.\n\nOh, and change the locks on your house.

Generally, there needs to be a period of time during which the parent does not have any contact with the child and does not pay child support. In most states, the period of time is one year, but this varies. \n\nhttps://www.justia.com/family/adoptions/termination-parental-rights/abandonment/\n\nChild abandonment occurs when a parent, guardian, or person in charge of a child either deserts a child without any regard for the child's physical health, safety or welfare and with the intention of wholly abandoning the child, or in some instances, fails to provide necessary care for a child living under their roof.\n\nhttps://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/child-abandonment.html\n\nShe was gone for 2 weeks without notifying her child's husband but the child (presumably) was in safe hands with her father.", "Except that legally, there is a gray area.

Go to court to get this back - if the child is living with you full time, you shouldn\u2019t be paying child support to the mother even if it\u2019s \u201cher week\u201d.\n\nChild support is for the needs of the child. If the child is living in your house, *you* provided. The mother is trying to double-dip here. \n\nLike others pointed out, the unannounced multi-week holiday is child abandonment.

She\u2019d need to give explicit permission. She was completely out of contact - including being out of contact at the end of the agreed period of looking after the kid. \n\nBy your logic, it wouldn\u2019t be abandonment if she literally never came back for the kid - but kept claiming child support for her 50% of the time.

I feel like I grew up and did everything I was supposed to and she always prioritized her hobbies. It got to a point where I felt like I was living with my daughter and a teenager (basically already a single dad). I was cruel and rude at points (and have accepted that and have made strides in being a better guy, through various means) but always did what I had to do while she was lazy and always selfish by prioritizing herself. \n\nSo yes, resentment that led to this outcome."]}
