I haven\u2019t had a biological parent since I was four years old I was raised by my grandfather until I was obviously 18 but he passed away about three years ago. \n\nMy brother and I lived with my grandfather when my mother passed away when I was four. My dad never came into my life and gave up custody(only child). My mother had three other siblings my aunt the oldest sister passed away five years after mom, my grandmother passed away a year before my aunt. \n\nSo it was just me, my brother and my grandpa for awhile. We were not doing well financially whatsoever. My grandparents were not young and my grandfather worked up until a couple weeks of his passing. My more than wealthy uncle and middle class aunt(the surviving sibs) came and did all the arrangements surrounding his death. This involved selling the home we lived in and the cars we drove that were in my grandparents name. They cut me and my brother 16k to split and took about 20K+ each. Leaving us with no home and no vehicles. I still don\u2019t have a car as I am in college and used that money for college and an apartment so I have a place to live. \n\nThe only way I was able to go to college was my sport. I was a talented athlete with good grades.Meaning I moved across country and haven\u2019t looked back since. My brother has a difficult time in life as he has mental issues such as PTSD Anxiety Depression and I don\u2019t know what else. Anyways my aunt or uncles haven\u2019t helped me with a thing. My grandmother on my dads side has been the only one stepping up. She\u2019s helped my brother get his own place but he is still struggling. We both are financially having a rough time. Not having a car in a big city has made it nearly impossible for me to save money, get internships, travel and just live a young adult life. Ever since I\u2019ve been a D1 athlete for the past four years neither my aunt(who acts like she\u2019s our \u2018mom\u2019 and has no kids) or uncle(has two 30+ children) ever came to see me at any sporting event. They have missed every single one, also all my award ceremonies. And now they are demanding I invite them to my commencement I\u2019ll be graduating with two bachelors and getting my masters next. \n\n\nMy issue is I never chose to be an orphan\u2026 and my uncle has enough money that he could pay for a lease and a brand new car and he wouldn\u2019t even sweat. Btw they bought their 6 figure house paid it off quickly and lived in it for 10 years and just sold it for 3x the price. He\u2019s refused to help us. He and his wife go on vacation once a month out of the country. But he thinks he has every right to Celebrate my accomplishments but never helped me out when I was down. My family has been extremely toxic and not too mention when his father was dying he showed up when he was on his death bed. And I was not allowed to see my grandfather in the hospital. Because my aunt said her and her brother were the only visitors allowed.

These people may technically be related to you by blood, but they aren't family.\n\nI'd bet that they just want to be invited so they can take as much credit for your success as possible.\n\nI'd rather have empty chairs than look at them if I were you.", "NTA, but I'm going to suggest an alternate option: **Rich people seem to work on reverse psychology for some reason**. They tend to give the biggest gifts to their richest friends (who don't need the gifts), and give smaller gifts to their less well-off friends (who could use the bigger gifts more).\n\nSo, I suggest: Invite them and tell them how **great** you are doing. If they offer to take you out to a nice restaurant after, take them up on it. Tell them your great plans for your Master's degree. Tell them how great it was to have a scholarship to get you through undergrad. Show them your apartment and tell them how great it was to find something so cheap in the city. Maybe let your inability to get internships due to lack of a car be the only downside you tell them.\n\nDon't go into it expecting any financial assistance... but if they respond like many of the well-off people I know, they will want to help 'support your success'... even though they seemed to not help very much when it was \"because you needed it\".", "Absolutely positively NTA. Keep your distance from these people as much as possible. You\u2019re not obligated to invite them when they basically done nothing to help you get where you\u2019re at in life! I\u2019m sorry they were shitty family members! They do not deserve to share in your achievements! Be proud of yourself for what you\u2019ve accomplished! This internet stranger is! Life dealt you a horrible hand but you\u2019ve done well for yourself. It will all pay off in the long run! Best of luck!!", "Not by any stretch of the imagination. These people are nothing to you and they\u2019ve only done you harm. Cut them off.", "NTA. Why you even care about these horrible people?\n\nBlock them and go on with your life.", "I was 20 yrs old\u2026. And no he didn\u2019t have a will, the issue wasn\u2019t the house the issue was selling our cars that were paid for. We paid insurance on them and everything. my brother who can lean to self harm needed somewhere to stay and they left him on the streets instead of just letting him stay with them for a month or two. I didn\u2019t expect them to front the cost of living I expected them to help us out after they kicked us out of our home. The first conversation they had about selling the estate was that they were entitled to all of the money and I\u2019m pretty sure they lied about how much they each got. Because my house was worth 300k.", "Depending on the state\u2026you and your brother were entitled to your mothers equal share (to split). It\u2019s too late, but the executor could have allowed the value of your cars to be part of that settlement, and cash you the difference between car value and your moms total share allowing you to keep your vehicles (assuming there weren\u2019t any loans out on those cars that had to be settled by the estate).   Families always get ugly when it comes to estate settlement.   A lot of your anger should be directed at your grandfather for not being an adult and have a Will & POAs in place.  Since he raised you he probably wanted you to have a bigger share, but G\u2019pa didn\u2019t take care of his business.   Selling it all and dividing equally per your states probate laws was the only legal option of the executor.  \n\nCould family have helped?  Sure. Were they obligated by law?  No, cuz G\u2019pa didn\u2019t set it up that way.  If they want to celebrate your graduation they must care about you.   Are you obligated by law to let them come?  No.  Would you be permanently cutting off what\u2019s left of your family for being bitter about something your G\u2019pa caused?   Probably.   \n\nIt\u2019s just a day\u2026a day you should be proud of, but still, in the big picture of your whole long life, just a day.   Forgiveness makes you the strong one.  BuT It\u2019s totally your call \ud83d\udcaf", "estates are difficult to deal with, especially without a will. if there was any debt, all of the valuable possessions of the deceased need to be sold to pay off that debt. and only the power of attorney, which i\u2019m assuming since he didn\u2019t have a will, was his eldest child, knows about the whole process and all the details. they can choose to divulge that information or not. maybe they were just greedy assholes, but idk all the details, and i\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t either since you don\u2019t even know how much the house actually sold for\n\nso yeah, it sucks. my family has been going through an estate thing for a while after my grandpa and mom died. we had to sell the house that had been in our family for 4 generations to pay off my mom\u2019s hospital debt. it\u2019s never ideal, but unfortunate shit happens. they didn\u2019t have to help you, but you don\u2019t have to include them in your life either", "I'm not sure the estate was worth 300k after paying off bills, fees, taxes. As for the cars, all that matters is whose name were on the deeds. When it comes to expecting anything from others, it's best not to expect anything but \n welcome anything that materializes. You never know a person's actual circumstances. I know a person who makes 40k in a month, expenses+debts are 38k and he's trying to survive on 2k in a hcol city. His family only know he's making 40k and are vexed on why his wallet is never open to them."]}
