As for being rejected from a ride?  Well.  She's got no-one else to blame.  So rides have limits and it's an occupational health and safety issue.  If the ride broke or she was hurt due to not being strapped in properly, she'd certainly be throwing her weight around and would be suing.  Sucks to be her at the moment.\n\nAs for your wheelchair - she needs to pay up for it.", "NTA, shes infantizing you and using you to take the eyes off of her, shes toxic", "NTA. To my understanding you can get on disability for being to overweight. This is probably leading her to be entitled and to believe that she is disabled. Some people are just bigger set naturally but at a certain point if your 300+ pounds you clearly arent eating right and shes already shown herself to be lazy. She needed a reality check and you gave it.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry, but this woman is not your friend. (disabled here)", "NTA honestly if she is using a wheelchair for her weight and there is no underlying condition, that alone should tell her that her weight is out of control. She needed a reality check instead of being enabled.", "NTA. \nIt was actually very rude to compare herself (whose situation, firstly, is a matter of choice, and secondly, reversible) with you. \nYou even set some boundaries regarding not being treated like a baby, which she ignored, in order to play kind of a \u201chealthy big sister\u201d role. But whenever it\u2019s convenient, then you\u2019re both disabled? \nIt\u2019s very fucked up, dude. I don\u2019t know how you keep on being friends\u2026", "Nta. As a fat person, this is fucking embarrassing. I can't imagine acting like your friend and thinking its okay. Good lord.", "NTA. Since you've already stated that she is lazy and doesn't take care of her health then sometimes people need a rude awakening. Her not fitting on the roller-coaster seat gave you a moment to let her know the truth. Plus her using you as crutch rather than facing herself and her shortcomings is not your fault. The truth hurts sometimes. May this be a wakeup call to her to get healthy and lose some weight. And I'm not fat shaming. The body positive movement has some toxic aspects to it. The main one being that it's healthy and normal to be obese. It's not. It's sad how many obese and morbidly obese people exist these days. You can place blame on many things. Processed and fast food being normalized as something that's ok to eat. It's not. It's toxic. Maybe a couple times a year as a junk food treat but that's it. You can blame pharmaceutical companies and doctors for prescribing medications that cause weight gain. You can blame marketing teams for making unhealthy food appealing. Instead of being honest about the addictive qualities of this shitty food. Anyway... I could rant more but I won't. I don't think you're the asshole.", "NTA. She can\u2019t ride a roller coaster because she\u2019s overweight and it\u2019s a safety precaution. Not like anyone is targeting her for being obese, it\u2019s just how it is. She needs to stop victimizing herself.", "NTA, she's sounds so annoying and needed a good telling off..You sound like such a rad person btw...100 NTA", "ESH. Your friend using you to get out of uncomfortable situations isn't cool especially after you asked her not to, but you going off on her publicly probably didn't motivate her in any way and was humiliating. I also wonder what that \"other stuff\" you said was.", "ESH. She tried to publicly embarrass you to take the embarrassment off herself. You returned the favor. Everyone can see what\u2019s really going on and know her issues are by choice whereas yours are by circumstance. Did she start it? Absolutely. But you didn\u2019t have to stoop to her level either.", "ESH. It would be absolutely appropriate to insist on not getting out of the car when you stop at the entrance. \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t stop for me, I\u2019m fine, let\u2019s just go park\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re more than welcome to get out if you wish but I would prefer to walk.\u201d It is not appropriate to tell her she just needs to exercise and \u201ctake care of herself.\u201d It is incredibly rare for people who are that overweight to be able to lose it by simply \u201ctaking care of themselves\u201d because underlying health conditions and genetic differences play such a strong role in obesity. The obesity epidemic started well before the body positivity movement. For the majority of obese people, if they could lose weight they would and they probably already have tried countless different things like dieting and working with a personal trainer. It is not a choice. You could have just chosen to ignore her outrage, you did not need to shame her further.", "ESH. Don't fat shame, especially in public. She also shouldn't use your amputee status for her benefit. Obesity is a lot more complicated than eat less, work out more. People need to realize that. But also, it's pathetic she specifically uses you as a scape goat for her own shortcomings.", "Yta because there's a time and a place for this conversation, you had the opportunity to have it in private many times and instead waited to pick a fight when she was already emotionally vulnerable and feeling embarrassed.", "ESH - two wrongs don't make a right.\n\nMorbid Obesity is a disability, stop gatekeeping.", "YTA. Being obese can make you disabled.  At her size and weight she likely as limited mobility.\n\nIt\u2019s also not just a choice to be fat or there wouldn\u2019t be fat people.", "YTA. Obesity is a disability and it\u2019s your own fault you let her sit in your wheelchair. If you don\u2019t like her quit hanging out with her but you are making wild assumptions about her behavior to you and were a total asshole in your treatment of her.", "YTA. She knows she\u2019s fat and she was embarrassed and she\u2019s sick of being shamed. That conversation could have happened in a more calm and kind setting. How educated are you on obesity?

He went on one of those rides with the serious heavy duty bars that lock into place because they hoist you up and drop you like 100 feet. \n\nAs soon as the bar locked his eyes started to bug out and he started to frantically wave to get the attendants attention. (I hate rides so I was on the ground watching and started to yell for someone to help him) \nHe was big but more importantly he had a huge barrel chest. \nHe couldn't yell out because when the bar locked it pushed all the air out of his lungs and he couldn't breathe. It locked so if the attendant had been an idiot (thankfully he noticed right away an got the bar unlocked just before my ex passed out) \n\nI have like 3 other terrifying stories about rides.on the other end my brother was almost killed on one due to not enough safety equipment and my dad grabbed him by the belt loop just in time and held on for dear life until the ride stopped.

Idk I was pretty young. ....huh, guess there is a reason I hate rides...\n\n\nIn other news....as someone whobis overweight I can say that op is NTA. She didn't fat shame her so much as she told her the straight up truth. That being said weight can be a disability albeit it arguably.  I take I less than 1000 calories a day. Usually less than 500. I walk 4 to 5 days a week for at least a hour. I am unable to lose weight. Although I am no where near 300lbs I'm also 5' nothing so it doesn't take much to notice any gain. \nIt's a medical issue. Hormones, DNA and pregnancy complications resulting in my muscles in my abs being al screwed up. \nI won't say it's a disability so much as I feel like I shouldn't be made to feel like I shouldn't need special accommodations for my size, I'm overweight for a short female but average size men are bigger than me so why am I being made to feel like I'm not normal? \n\nPeople who need motorized scooters and other things to get around might be overweight but maybe their lack of mobility and whatever they have been dealing with cause the weight gain, not the other way around. I'm just saying we shouldn't make blanket assumptions. \n\nBut in this case no, the friend was being stupid and clueless and needed the reality check. Honestly she will lose friends with her crap and op did her a huge favor by being straight with her. \n\nThe best thing one of my friends ever did for me is tell me the truth. I had a quirk that was passing everyone off and I was clueless because where I came from it was something everyone did so I had zero clue it was bothering people. My friend told me I I kept doing it I would find myself with no friends. \nYes it hurt to hear but I thought about it and realized she didn't have to tell me, she could have just let everyone push me out of the group. Instead she cared enough to let me know and give me a chance to fix the issue. \n\nWe are still friends 30 years later. \n\nOP you did the best thing you could have for her.

I would have been more scare for him than myself.", "I hear what you\u2019re saying but when I\u2019m infantilized for being disabled and her scapegoat, I kind of lose the moral compass.", "it sounds like you're not listening to OP. \nWe can see fativism is important to you but diminishing ops experience dealing with their inconsiderate friend is not the way to do it my man.", "he was bordering on crying, that's about when my laughing set in, he didnt have any injuries, but he wouldnt get on anymore rides after that.", "Okay. I get she is being shitty too but I just don\u2019t think what you said was ok nor is your insistence that losing weight is super easy. But I\u2019m clearly in the minority. Just maybe consider cutting her out because she shouldn\u2019t have someone in her life who treats her like this just as you shouldn\u2019t have anyone in your life who treats you as she does", "What she\u2019s saying about this friend\u2019s weight is hateful, especially to her face. I give up.", "Good."]}
