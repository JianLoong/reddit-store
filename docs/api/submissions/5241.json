Around 2-3 weeks ago a new girl started, let\u2019s call her Sasha (30f). The week after Sasha started, payroll screwed up her paycheck and only paid her like $3. I came into the office as she was crying, saying she needed the check to pay her car payment, and if she didn\u2019t pay that day it would be repoed. So I loaned her $200 and told her to just pay me back when they corrected her check, which was meant to be the next day.\n\nThe next day when she received her corrected check, she texted me asking if instead of paying me back she could simply be my ride to work for the month of December. I usually take the train and wouldn\u2019t pay that much for transportation, but I said sure since I could tell she needed it. About a week later Sasha got in trouble at work for not performing, and made it into a race issue. Not only that, she dragged MY name in as a witness. I told HR I had no clue what she was referring to and didn\u2019t call again for a ride, that was last week.\n\nCome Thursday I spoke with her about wanting my money back. She gave me rides for a week, so I figured it was more than fair to only ask for $120 back. When I said this to her she said \u201cumm, okay.\u201d  Come Friday I sent the cashapp request.\n\nSo Saturday night she declined the cashapp request, and texted me saying she wouldn\u2019t be paying me back. That she was \u201cbeing nice\u201d by giving me rides, and she was keeping the $200 for the ONE WEEK of rides she gave me. I responded saying that wasn\u2019t what we had agreed to at all, and I was willing to work out a payment system but I wanted my money back\u2026 she never responded. And since we get bonuses and I know hers was at least $250, so it isn\u2019t a financial issue. \n\nI was venting to one of my friends, and they suggested I report her to HR for creating a hostile work environment. Which I want to do, but idk if I have a right to, or if it\u2019s worth her losing her job over this since she\u2019s already had HR issues.
