I came into the office as she was crying, saying she needed the check to pay her car payment, and if she didn\u2019t pay that day it would be repoed. So I loaned her $200 and told her to just pay me back when they corrected her check, which was meant to be the next day.\n\nThe next day when she received her corrected check, she texted me asking if instead of paying me back she could simply be my ride to work for the month of December. I usually take the train and wouldn\u2019t pay that much for transportation, but I said sure since I could tell she needed it. About a week later Sasha got in trouble at work for not performing, and made it into a race issue. Not only that, she dragged MY name in as a witness. I told HR I had no clue what she was referring to and didn\u2019t call again for a ride, that was last week.\n\nCome Thursday I spoke with her about wanting my money back.

When I said this to her she said \u201cumm, okay.\u201d  Come Friday I sent the cashapp request.\n\nSo Saturday night she declined the cashapp request, and texted me saying she wouldn\u2019t be paying me back.

You can\u2019t change terms midstream unilaterally.\n\nOP was never not getting stiffed here", "There's very little HR can exactly do for OP in this regard.\n\nThey can't force Sasha to give back the money, and nothing she's done regarding her actions with specifically OP would warrant professional punishment.", "Since she's already having performance issues a couple of weeks in, I don't think they're going to have a problem building a case against her.", "Never loan money.\n\nFriend or family? It\u2019s a gift.\n\nI don\u2019t know you? The answer is no", "There was a meeting of the minds as proof by the fact that OP received a week's worth of rides. \n\nOP could have said, and should have said, no when Sasha proposed the change. At that point the $200 loan repayment in cash was enforceable. OP didn't. They accepted the change both verbally and in practice by getting into the car each day for 5 days.\n\nI don't disagree that it was a foolish thing to do but if OP had received the rides it would have worked out at $10 per trip ($5 if Sasha was taking her home as well) and that is not an unreasonable exchange.\n\nThe contract was not unilaterally changed it was changed by consent and then by action. OP requesting the money now is unilateral because Sasha does not consent and doesn't have to, they can say no we agreed I would drive you and I'm still willing to do that but I am not agreeing to change the contract again. Sucks for OP but I go back to my original statement. Do not lend money to colleagues.", "It\u2019s crazy to me that our countries are so similar in so many ways yet still paying out with checks or a third party card?", "NTA. \n\nI would be petty and take her to small claims court.", "ESH. You fucked up bigtime and in more than one way. First by lending money, and second by deciding partway through the agreed payment method to switch to a different one. The rides were meant to be the payback and you agreed to it. You don't get to change the terms after the first week of rides and then decide how much money that equates to. Coworker sucks for just being a bad person in general.", "Cut your losses and assume that money is now gone. Sadly, it sounds like you encountered quite a person. I would stay away from this person and completely isolate myself from their sphere of control. They have already showed you they can\u2019t be trusted. Too bad you had to lose money to figure that out but better sooner than later though.", "Well hopefully most of it was through text so that Op can have visual proof.", "Back when we were still receiving paper paychecks, they didn't get delivered on time and I really needed mine. I sat in the administrator's office until she hand-wrote one for me. \n\nno reason to go to coworkers for \"loans\".", "NTA but ngl you are kinda dumb for loaning someone you don\u2019t know money, chances are u are screwed", "NTA-but your work can\u2019t help you and it might make you look bad for having poor judgment. Your co worker is a scam artist your only legal recourse would be small claims court if you can prove it was a loan and not a gift. Considering you received some rides and it\u2019s such a small amount it\u2019s not worth it.", "YWBTA Your coworker didn't steal anything. You gave a stranger $200. Then, when instead of paying you back immediately, she said she wanted to give you rides for a month, you said YES. I am really sorry that your kindness is being punished, but you offered the money, accepted the bad deal, and then thought you would be able to still get money out of this person. You can certainly take a shot at small claims court, but I'm not sure what you're going to get out of it. It is possible that if the texts show her agreeing to the $120 payment you could get that. I don't think you have a shot at the $200, though.", "Why tf would you loan someone you don't know $200? If you've got that sort of cash to burn I've got a bridge to sell you.\n\nThats an expensive lesson to not be so naive.\n\nYou're NTA, but you're not getting that money back either short of taking her to court.", "yeah, would probably be a mess to put it in small claims.. outcome very much depending on the mood of the judge.\n\nTheoratically the only claim could be that changin from a month to 1 week is not allowed, but whether it has to be compensated or the 3 weeks have to be completed?", "Funny Sara sucks at her job..so she made it into a race issue...now keeps your money..I would file it with HR..so they know who they are dealing with..especially if you have problems with her in the future", "NAH.  You can go to HR if you want to, but it wasn't your place to get involved in the first place.  She didn't \"steal\" any money from you, you let her borrow it, and allowed her to make dubious conditions to \"pay you back\".  None of this is on the company.  However, I would definitely warn everyone else in the office to never lend her money if they plan on seeing it again.", "Sounds like the original check was what she deserved..$3", ">she texted me asking if instead of paying me back she could simply be my ride to work for the month of December.\n\nNTA but a fool to agree to this. This was not the basis on which the money was lent, and should have been a massive red flag that she was dishonest. She had no intention of ever paying you back.\n\nTake her to small claims, escalate at work, do whatever you need to get that money back, and warn all your other coworkers.", "NTA\n\nStay away from this woman. The loan was not part of work. So probably HR is not the correct route.\n\nYou need to document every interaction with this woman, who, where, when and what to protect yourself.", "You should report her", "NTA. Like others have said you may have to write this exchange and relationship with her off. However I would document it somewhere and have a word with your supervisor. In my last job we had a staff member constantly trying to guilt trip new staff members into loaning her money and then never paying them back. She\u2019d play the victim and say she didn\u2019t have enough to feed or clothe her children but once the money changed hands she\u2019d comment to another member of staff that she can now book a personal trainer at the gym that week. \n\nThis happened a few times before it was brought to my attention. People would come to me and complain that she\u2019s taken money off of someone else. I asked why they hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone about it, my manager was aware of the issue but because no one had reported it she couldn\u2019t intervene. I get a bit protective over the newbies until they\u2019ve found their feet so when they started griping to me about it I\u2019d ask them if they wanted me to report it. They\u2019d say they didn\u2019t want to make a big issue of it but it kept happening. \n\nIt came to a head when she borrowed money from someone who couldn\u2019t afford to write the money off and it was looking to get physical at work so I sent it up the chain. Reported it to my manager who pulled the staff member into a HR meeting. I guess she got chewed out as she had to contact everyone that had lent her money and return it ASAP to the penny. She wouldn\u2019t speak to me after that incident which wasn\u2019t much of a loss but morale went up. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have done anything except people kept coming to me and venting, I was worried someone would go to HR themselves and would claim we were enabling it by not intervening.", "Exactly, op made an insanely stupid decision and $200 is a very cheap lesson to start to think. OP is 24, I'm a quite surprised the level of bad decision making here.\n\nLike, she lent the money to someone:\n\n* She has known for a less than a month\n\n* Only knows them as a coworker rather than a friend\n\n* Has no money at all\n\n* Has a record of making very poor financial decisions\n\n* Is already in debt\n\n\nWhy would you even do it... I'd understand more if she was an acquaintance from OPs personal life but she isn't\n\nNow OP is crying because she made a stupid decision, and wants to follow it with another dumb move of reporting it to the HR. Firstly, it is a personal conflict and if one of my subordinates came to me crying that 'x owes me money and never paid back' I would have felt like a primary school teacher dealing with two children. Like, what do you want me to do? Meet with the other party and tell them 'pay back OP'? As a manager (and same for HR) we don't get involved in such petty super personal conflicts, I have no right to tell the other party what to do. OP really needs to start to use her brain, because she is being delusional about what kind of involvement the manager / HR are even allowed to have.\n\nFurthermore, again as a manager, I would question the character of OP' coworker, however, I'd also have concerns over OP's good judgement and decision making. While I would not voice any of that to either of them, I'd keep it in mind when observing their work.", "Yeah, it's a confusing term. Hostile work environment doesn't mean \"someone is being hostile to me at work\", it means \"the workplace is hostile towards individuals based on certain protected characteristics*\". \n\nI think it's an unhelpful term, since it's so widely misunderstood.\n\n*ETA: such as race, sex, orientation, disability, etc.", "Report for what?\n\nWhat exactly do you think I would and could do?", "Same can be said to you.\n\nNot having a very poor judgement is a vital skill, especially when youre in you mid 20s and in work."]}
