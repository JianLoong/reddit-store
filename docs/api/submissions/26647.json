Some people can afford to volunteer while others need to pay their bills. \n\nPerhaps you should tell him that Bill Gates donated 5 billion last year and the fact that he did that while this guy didn't is an absolutely reprehensible demonstration of his appalling greed and he should be ashamed to show his face on campus. Of course that would be ridiculous. His attack on you is equally asinine. \n\nIf you can afford to do so and choose to offer it, you can always offer a certain number of slots or a study group for lower income students who can't afford the higher priced tutoring. However, just because you are gifted in a particular area does not oblige you to beggar yourself. Why should the college make money from your work?\n\nPlease recognize that all traditions start with someone and before this became a tradition, there were those who also didn't participate.\n\nNTA", "You understand that this is a little scam your college cooked up years ago, to get their best students to pull up the grades of their less-stellar compadres while making the lower achievers pay to raise their own -- and the college's -- performance?\n\nThe scam works by 1) playing up to the high achievers' egos, telling them how **special** they are,  2) offering a small wage (NOT out of their own coffers, how generous of them!) so they can deflect possible accusations of exploitation, and 3) guilt-tripping with \"decades of tRaDiTiOn\" to ensure the compliance of their conscripts.\n\nYou are NTA for refusing to fall in line with this little scam. I hope your refusal gives courage to the current and future \"assistants\" to decline to participate.", "NTA. This *tradition* is paying well below market rate.

But it's naive to expect your best student to work so far below market price.\n\nIt would be so cool if the school would step in financially and pay some on top of the $20,  but there is no such agreement...\n\nSo, NAH.\n\nI think it's sad you need to choose the money.  not because \"it's a tradition\" but because everyone deserves a fair chance, and affordable tutoring can really help with that.\n\nEdit: I'm wondering how long it has been $20. Maybe it was a good amount once, like 15 years ago...", "never honor a tradition that is harming you. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
