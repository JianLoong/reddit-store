It had been 8 years of half truths, lies, denials and coverups. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with a person you cannot trust?", "Like wtf? 44 yo, you are together 8 years and now you thinking about children? NTA, but what you thinking before?", "NTA why have a child with a liar you cannot trust? How can she be a co-parent with you? A baby (however unlikely)will make all these issues ten times worse!!! Don\u2019t do it! If she acts this way now, imagine sharing custody of a baby and being tied to her for 18 years no matter what lies, cheating and bankruptcy she drags you and your possible child through. Get out now while you have the chance. Nobody has seven times more debt than they know of. She has lied to you for years. There are lots of fish in the sea and if you are determined to have kids you are in the wrong relationship. Escape while you can!!", "You are NTA. This lady is 11 your senior and you have presented more than enough \ud83d\udea9. You sound like you have gone the extra mile for long enough. Just my opinion but I would make a clean break. Seems like you keep discovering new issues. Enough is enough.", "NTA. \n\nShe showed you who she was with her lying and cheating at the start of the relationship, and you should have listened then. \n\nThis is the risk that you take when you date someone significantly older than you when you\u2019re young. Chances are she couldn\u2019t get someone her own age because they were too wise to her shit. \n\nIf your gut is telling you that you shouldn\u2019t be married, dear god, don\u2019t get married.", "Just getting her finances in order has opened a lot of red flags.  NTA.", "DUDE! She is a habitual liar! WHY are you still with her? WTF are you doing getting married to this unreliable mess? WHY?! You 2 are incompatible even without her unreliable nature. Dont do this to yourself.", "NTA...But you are definitely the AH to yourself for staying with her for so long. She showed you exactly who she was in the beginning and has continually lied and manipulated you. A healthy relationship is built on trust, respect, and communication, and you two have none of that. Dude, run! Run as fast as you can. ESPECIALLY before you have children with this woman and she ruins the rest of you life... Or at least the next 18 years.\n\nOne big thing I learned after being in my last long term and very toxic relationship before I met my life partner, is that I can not expect someone to truly value, respect and love me if I don't value, respect, and love myself first. So I highly recommend you take some time for some healing from this, and learn how to have those things for yourself before getting in your next relationship so you don't repeat these same mistakes. Therapy would also be a great thing for you. I promise you that someone who will truly value, respect, support, and love you is out there, but you won't find them as long as you allow people like her to be in your life.", "NTA.\n\nIf you dont want to immediatly break up (i mean you sound very conflicted on that), I think you definitly need additional counselling with her about that and postpone any marriage-plans.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One reason people marry before having children is to establish their relationship prior to adding other responsibilities like dependent humans with needs and feelings.

Thats going really far to lie and trick you. This is indicative of her morals.

If the roles were reversed (33F with a 44M who had debt and lied about his fertility) I would suggest she run. Saying the same to you, sir. Doesn't sound like you'd be able to support this family. Maybe work on yourself and your trauma for a while, save up some money, and get into a better place before starting a family.

Is staying engaged but bot planning a wedding on the table? Gives you both time to work things out and discuss more and see if it can be worked out. Cold feet isn't an asshole move. Assessing if you're right for each other isn't an asshole move. Take some time, and if you've done that already and are thinking 'I don't want the rest of my life to be like this', then you already know its time to go.

What advice would you give him?   The red flags you've mentioned are only the ones you've identified SO FAR.  Also, look up the term 'sunk cost fallacy'.
