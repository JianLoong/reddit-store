First of all, a little back story. I used to work at an ice cream shop and I really liked my job, and I worked this job for 2 years. I never had an issue at this job except for about 3 months ago when I was called on by the owner and told my clothes were not \"appropriate\" and I would need to invest in new clothes.\n\nI was pretty shocked by this as I always just wore the labelled shirt they have us and jeans or khaki shorts. The only time I could think of that I may have dressed \"inappropriately\" was when about a week before this conversation I was called in to work out of the blue because someone didn't show. At the time I was out and about and while I always kept a spare work shirt in my car I didn't have any pants and just went in in the jean shorts I was wearing. The shorts were....definitely not my first choice to wear to a job where I'm bent down in freezers ass up the whole time, but I wasn't about to go home just to grab my pants.\n\nWhen I got in the manager on shift was an older woman who's husband would hang around the shop when she worked. He sometimes acted as a \"handy-man\" around the store, but mostly just sat by the counter the whole time. The whole time I worked that shift he was sitting at the counter watching me. I didn't think anything of it at the time and even then when I asked the owner who had complained she claimed it was a customer and I chose to believe her.\n\nFor months I put it out of my mind until a couple days ago I was working with a guy who is around my age. We were recounting stories about work and laughing when he brought up me being dress-coded and said \"remember when Mike(The older Manager's Husband) complained about you having a camel toe to the owner?\"\n\nI had no idea what he was talking about, and when he realized I didn't know he got very uncomfortable. When I pressed him he told me that everyone knew because the older manager had told everyone how \"sl\\*tty\" I dressed and how I had spent the whole shift trying to \"entice\" her husband(who is in his mid-50's). \n\nI was so embarrassed and I left right then and there. I called my boss to tell her that I wasn't coming back. She begged me to stay for at least until after thanksgiving because we were going to be so busy and I had already agreed to work those shifts and everyone else had taken time off. I told her no and blocked her number, but now I feel really bad. I really liked my job and I never thought I would be the type of person to just walk out without any notice.", "created_utc": 1668894904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzn78a/aita_for_quitting_my_job_and_intentionally/", "score": 611, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ideally, you don't do this, but given that the boss was actually sexualizing how you dressed and being gross (you were trying to entice her husband WHAT?!), you're justified. She deserves being left in the lurch, and if you feel bad about your coworkers, remember that if they end up with more hours, it's your boss's failing, not yours. If she wanted to keep you as an employee, she should've acted like a decent human being instead of blaming you for whatever insecurities she has.  \n\nYou'll find better jobs, and better work environments.

She can cover your shifts.  This reminds me of a time a bartender friend of mine was forced to leave a party to cover another person's shift immediately no excuses (couldn't even go home and change, had to have a dd drive them cause party) and the on shift manager yelled at them for being drunk (despite my friend telling them, I'm drunk and at a party right now when called).  That manager was fired in 3 days though, sorry you had to quit.", "NTA. The camel toe comment was straight-up nasty.

Let's ignore the fact that you were grossly sexualized at work (we shouldn't, no one ever should, but let's do it for the sake of argument).  You were profoundly disrespected after doing them a monster favor.  That's not how you treat a good employee.  If they needed you so badly they should have been respectful to you.  And seriously, it's just bad business to be in a state where one person can quit and drastically affect things.  What if you had gotten hurt and had to quit?  What if you were just sick?  What if you were offered a better job?  What if you had done something that they had to fire you for?  Their failure to plan for a single employee being unavailable is not your problem in any way.  The fact that they'd have the audacity to grossly sexualize you in the process makes it just the cherry on that particular asshole sundae.", "NTA \n\nYou don't owe that company anything, you deserve to work somewhere that an insecure manager doesn't feel the need to disparage you for your outfits.

Good advice and a kind attitude.", "Nta. As a boss myself, if I'm begging an employee to stay, it's because I value you as an employee and asset to the company (not becausewe'regoing to be busy).  Furthermore,  I'd have had a one on one conversation with you regarding the dress code.  In addition, I'd have told my manager that it's highly inappropriate to suggest a 19 year old is seducing her 50 year old husband and to keep him out of my business period. Nta on so many levels.

That means this 50 year could have been sexualizing a minor, depending on the dates involved!!", "NTA because your manager should not have been gossiping about you at all, let alone standing by while her nasty ass husband talks dirty about a young woman.  I get that he's filth and she's married to him, but still, he's filth.  \n\nThe owner was okay with an older man making untoward comments about someone who saved his lame ass wife's ass that night, and then when confronted, the owner lied to you.  \n\nI really don't know what you could have done differently except to not answer the phone when they needed someone last minute.", "NTA.\n\nAnd hell maybe this\u2019ll be something they learn from.

Job is a job, places are always hiring, never feel guilty for quitting.", "NTA. First off I also work at an ice cream store and our dress code is pretty simple , you just need to wear sneakers and an apron, shirt and any type of pants.
