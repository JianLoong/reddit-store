All fake names\n\nTW: Traumatic pregnancy, miscarriage, traumatic birth, near infant-death, sick children.\n\nMy husband (45M) and I (F36) have 2 children; \"Alex\" (12M) and \"Harry\" (5M). When I was younger, I had a lot of intestinal issues and ended up having major surgery. Less than 6 months later, I found out that I as pregnant. I was told that it was fine. \n\nIt was not fine. \n\nFrom around week 20 I was in serious pain as the fresh scar tissue was stretched. The birth was rough and premature and I ended up having contractions and was 4 cm open for 72 hrs.\n\nIn spite of this, my husband and I really wanted another kid, and 5 years later we conceived. We found out 2 days before leaving on a trip to see my husband's parents who live abroad. We figured it would be fine.\n\nIt was not fine.\n\nI had a miscarriage 2 weeks into the visit. My MIL was supposed to take care of Alex so my husband could stay with me at the hospital and translate for me. She went shopping instead, so my husband had to stay with Alex, leaving me alone and not knowing what was going on because I don't speak the language. It was awful.\n\nFast-forward another couple of years and I got pregnant again. The birth was also traumatic as I passed out half-way.\n\n4 weeks later, I found Harry in his crib, blue in the face and unresponsive. He wasn't breathing and I started CPR.\n\nI managed to revive our son myself and we went to the hospital to get him checked out afterwards. He  recovered entirely and is generally a healthy, if a bit wild boy.\n\nAll this has left me with PTSD. I can't handle babies. If I get close to an infant, I get the phantom feeling of a limp dead baby in my arms, I get flashbacks and nausea and panic attacks. The same for visibly pregnant women.\n\nNow, my niece \"Andrea\" (19F) is pregnant and she's going through a rough patch, but I can't be around her without getting the aforementioned symptoms, so for the time being, I've withdrawn from family get-togethers. If my niece is going to be there, I just don't go. My husband is taking the boys so they don't miss out, but I just can't.\n\nMy mum, however, is annoyed by this. She thinks it's selfish of me not to help, which I feel like I have. We've donated everything we had from when Harry was a baby, including his pram, baby monitors, etc, all expensive items we could have sold for good money instead. I just can't be there in person.\n\nShe thinks it's ridiculous that I feel this way because Harry didn't die, and in some ways I can't help but feel that she might be right because Harry *is* here and I'm so grateful that he is. I also really want to be there for my niece, but I just feel so awful whenever I try.\n\nMy mum thinks I need to try harder and has been trying to force it by not telling me that my niece will be visiting when we go there. \n\nI've looked into getting therapy, but the only person in my country who specialises in this has a 2 year waiting list.\n\nBut AITA for ignoring my niece?", "created_utc": 1692867353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zwc97/aita_for_ignoring_my_pregnant_niece/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope you'll be able to get it. \n\nYour niece needs support right now, but it's understandable why you can't provide it. You didn't actively choose to be traumatized and your family members shouldn't be telling you to get over it. \n\nI see this situation as your niece needing help and you being unable to provide it because of your trauma.

You've had a pretty awful concurrent list of experiences, and you're an incredibly strong woman to have got through them all.\n\nYour mother, on the other hand, is behaving disgracefully. She has no right to continuously put you in such horrible positions, and it must be aqful for your niece to be used as a pawn like this while she is pregnant. Your mother is purposely setting you both up for failure and making a future relationship between you completely impossible. She needs to be stopped, instantly.\n\nI really recommend you block your mother for a while. Tell her that her traumatising manipulations are at an end, and that when you are ready to hear a full and sincere apology from her for her disgusting comments and tricks, you will let her know. Then block and ignore. It is impossible to get over trauma whilst you being continuously retraumatised. Tell everyone who asks why you've blocked your mother exactly that.\n\nAlso, send your niece a message explaining that this has nothing to do with her and how happy you are for her and her family. You just need to focus on healing from the repeated traumas you have experienced before you can be present, and that you hope your mother's despicable actions haven't caused her stress during her pregnancy.\n\nGood luck!", "It's not a \"feeling\", it's PTSD and you mom should treat with the seriousness it deserves.

You\u2019ve just come up against your mom\u2019s limitations and ignorance.  You can forgive her for it, and still protect yourself.\n\nIt sounds like you and your mom haven\u2019t completed the journey to adult child / parent .  It takes a fair bit of effort for parents to let go, and for kids to realise that their parents are just aa stupid as they are !", "NTA.\n\nThe comments about therapy are useless. Even if you were in therapy that wouldn\u2019t mean you would be able to be around your nice or any newborn. It is not some sort of magic.\n\nYou did help, you did donate expensive stuff, you could have sell everything and maybe you would have the money for therapy.\n\nPlus nobody should be forced to help someone or to be around someone.

Phone calls and text messages, emails and hand-written cards, care packages or premade meal that you send with someone else.\n\nI think your mom may mean well. She wants you to support your niece but maybe also wants her own daughter (you) to be better. I imagine it breaks her heart a bit to not be able to help/heal you. \n\nQuiet 1-1 conversations however you can manage them and another compassionate therapist may help you find some coping mechanisms.", "I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through. \n\nNTA.

You do not have to live like this.", "NTA, but as everyone else has said. Please seek therapy. \n\nIt's only going to get worse from here, and it's unrealistic to think you can avoid every baby and pregnant lady in the world. What are you going to do when your boys grow up and have babies of their own? Seek help if not for yourself, your children and your future grandchildren. I promise it will get better, but you have to try first.", "NTA\n\nPlease do put yourself on that waiting list for the therapy, OP. 2 years go quickly, and then you can get help. You will want to be able to be there in the future for your DILs, and PTSD needs to be treated to go away. I know because I've had it. \n\nYou can't help your niece right now, but there are other family members who can, so just let it go. Maybe you might be able to explain this on the phone to her. She might understand, even if your mother doesn't. And please put boundaries for your mother. You're an adult, and she is not allowed to control you like this. She is TA.", "I am sorry for your loss and the trauma you have been through.  I don't know if this is really an AITA question. As many have stated you need therapy, as you stated it is a long waiting list to get this help. Have  you looked into online resources for help? We live in an age where a counselor doesn't  have to necessarily be in your area but things can be done online, with online video appointments.  Have you looked to see if there are any support groups around?  Your niece I hope is understandable after your experience but she may feel hurt that you are avoiding her especially with the hormones of pregnancy. Maybe you can find another way to show her support send her letter or small gifts that let her know you are indeed thinking about her and wishing her the best.", "Gentle YTA. You need therapy and your niece needs your support. What happens if you ever get grandkids? You need to get this sorted ASAP.", "NAH but you should definitely try to contact a therapist ASAP.

This is a tough one for me. I was born at 24 weeks back in the 80s. I too stopped breathing once I was finally allowed home and my mum had to get me breathing again. More than once. And she was young too.\nShe is still traumatised by all of these things. I have personally witnessed this. But if my girlfriend and I present her with a grandchild she would explode with love and happiness. Show her any baby actually and she melts. \nIt's understandable.

I had somewhat of a breakdown 6 months later and I have a depression, but I haven't really been around infants or pregnant women since, so the ptsd wasn't triggered.", "They're not in the US", "This could definitely help. As OP can't physically be around her, virtually connecting would be a better option not just to help the niece but also to ease the discomfort.", "It has one (1) therapist that deals with it. With a two year waiting list.", "\"thing not exist\" \n\n\"What a terrible excuse\"", "I second this. I didn\u2019t learn it in therapy, but it always helps me. Just journaling out my thoughts. Any bad thoughts I can write out and then throw away. And I am able to at least mostly move past stuff. I find that when I forget to throw it away and stumble upon it I have usually forgotten the feelings/events entirely until seeing it again.", "The ones I've talked to are all referring me to her and I do get updates, but they're infrequent. Unfortunately I live in a very small country, so it's limited what options there are", "If it makes it easier, write down a message to tell your family how you are coping with all of this, and how you are actively trying to work on yourself but that you can't handle this right now because you are not well. But that you love them and support them as much as you are able.\n\nOr, show them this post, let them know that this is a raw experience for you and if you force yourself, you're going to be more hindrance than help.\n\nYou are not TA.", "They can help you with grounding techniques for your anxiety related to this.\n\nThrowing your hands up in the air and saying \"welp! I can't do anything for at least 2 years\" is very defeatist. And not the solution.", "Are there any online options outside of your area? Virtual therapy will open up options.", "I wasn't saying that as an insult, but ptsd and panic disorders do put loved ones especially dependants at risk. What if you're holding him walking through town, you see a pregnant woman holding a baby, and you have a panic attack, you're at risk of dropping your child, passing out from a panic attack, will leave your child unattended. If you have flashbacks, depending how severe and you could physically re-live a moment that was traumatising, there is a lot than can be dangerous about un-checked mental illness. This from someone who strangled a loved 1, due to ptsd episode, I went to therapy that helped a lot.", "I would say almost ANY therapist could help you at least a little and is better than waiting 2 years\u2026? While waiting you could go and get at least some help either on the symptoms or to start working on the trauma more from a general aspect.\n\nSure if it\u2019s not working, go to another, happens time and time again. But if your life depends on 1 single person, you would be doomed if that person might stop working one day? Or never be available? Or moves? Or you move?", "Where I live there are emergency therapists, institutions, helplines, etc. Available 24/7, 365-366days a year.\n\nSaid under what circumstances I see this a bad excuse. If OP lives in a country that doesn\u2019t offer any alternatives, sure that excuse works just fine. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f so let the family and whoever ese involved keep suffering for the next 2 years, while the trauma and symptoms might just get worse, plus therapy itself might take months to years to show any effect anyway.\n\nBut good thing we have reddit to tell her that waiting for years isn\u2019t such a big deal :)", "You would be incorrect.", "This is incorrect. Any therapist WILL NOT WORK, for ptsd. Seeing someone not qualified for it, can just be MORE traumatic. And yes, I have ptsd and speak from experience."]}
