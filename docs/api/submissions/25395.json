All fake names\n\nTW: Traumatic pregnancy, miscarriage, traumatic birth, near infant-death, sick children.\n\nMy husband (45M) and I (F36) have 2 children; \"Alex\" (12M) and \"Harry\" (5M). When I was younger, I had a lot of intestinal issues and ended up having major surgery. Less than 6 months later, I found out that I as pregnant. I was told that it was fine. \n\nIt was not fine. \n\nFrom around week 20 I was in serious pain as the fresh scar tissue was stretched. The birth was rough and premature and I ended up having contractions and was 4 cm open for 72 hrs.\n\nIn spite of this, my husband and I really wanted another kid, and 5 years later we conceived. We found out 2 days before leaving on a trip to see my husband's parents who live abroad. We figured it would be fine.\n\nIt was not fine.\n\nI had a miscarriage 2 weeks into the visit. My MIL was supposed to take care of Alex so my husband could stay with me at the hospital and translate for me. She went shopping instead, so my husband had to stay with Alex, leaving me alone and not knowing what was going on because I don't speak the language. It was awful.\n\nFast-forward another couple of years and I got pregnant again. The birth was also traumatic as I passed out half-way.\n\n4 weeks later, I found Harry in his crib, blue in the face and unresponsive. He wasn't breathing and I started CPR.\n\nI managed to revive our son myself and we went to the hospital to get him checked out afterwards. He  recovered entirely and is generally a healthy, if a bit wild boy.\n\nAll this has left me with PTSD. I can't handle babies. If I get close to an infant, I get the phantom feeling of a limp dead baby in my arms, I get flashbacks and nausea and panic attacks. The same for visibly pregnant women.\n\nNow, my niece \"Andrea\" (19F) is pregnant and she's going through a rough patch, but I can't be around her without getting the aforementioned symptoms, so for the time being, I've withdrawn from family get-togethers. If my niece is going to be there, I just don't go. My husband is taking the boys so they don't miss out, but I just can't.\n\nMy mum, however, is annoyed by this. She thinks it's selfish of me not to help, which I feel like I have. We've donated everything we had from when Harry was a baby, including his pram, baby monitors, etc, all expensive items we could have sold for good money instead. I just can't be there in person.\n\nShe thinks it's ridiculous that I feel this way because Harry didn't die, and in some ways I can't help but feel that she might be right because Harry *is* here and I'm so grateful that he is. I also really want to be there for my niece, but I just feel so awful whenever I try.\n\nMy mum thinks I need to try harder and has been trying to force it by not telling me that my niece will be visiting when we go there. \n\nI've looked into getting therapy, but the only person in my country who specialises in this has a 2 year waiting list.\n\nBut AITA for ignoring my niece?", "created_utc": 1692867353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zwc97/aita_for_ignoring_my_pregnant_niece/", "score": 1106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you are dealing with your mental health issues the best you can without access to therapy. \n\nYou are providing support in the way you can and removing yourself from events because you know it wouldn\u2019t be fair to ask you niece to be excluded. \n\nThe whole situation sucks and I hope you are able to get help soon.", "Firstly, you definitely need therapy. I hope you'll be able to get it. \n\nYour niece needs support right now, but it's understandable why you can't provide it. You didn't actively choose to be traumatized and your family members shouldn't be telling you to get over it. \n\nI see this situation as your niece needing help and you being unable to provide it because of your trauma.

You've had a pretty awful concurrent list of experiences, and you're an incredibly strong woman to have got through them all.\n\nYour mother, on the other hand, is behaving disgracefully. She has no right to continuously put you in such horrible positions, and it must be aqful for your niece to be used as a pawn like this while she is pregnant. Your mother is purposely setting you both up for failure and making a future relationship between you completely impossible. She needs to be stopped, instantly.\n\nI really recommend you block your mother for a while. Tell her that her traumatising manipulations are at an end, and that when you are ready to hear a full and sincere apology from her for her disgusting comments and tricks, you will let her know. Then block and ignore. It is impossible to get over trauma whilst you being continuously retraumatised. Tell everyone who asks why you've blocked your mother exactly that.\n\nAlso, send your niece a message explaining that this has nothing to do with her and how happy you are for her and her family. You just need to focus on healing from the repeated traumas you have experienced before you can be present, and that you hope your mother's despicable actions haven't caused her stress during her pregnancy.\n\nGood luck!", "It's not a \"feeling\", it's PTSD and you mom should treat with the seriousness it deserves.

You\u2019ve just come up against your mom\u2019s limitations and ignorance.  You can forgive her for it, and still protect yourself.\n\nIt sounds like you and your mom haven\u2019t completed the journey to adult child / parent .  It takes a fair bit of effort for parents to let go, and for kids to realise that their parents are just aa stupid as they are !", "NTA.\n\nThe comments about therapy are useless. Even if you were in therapy that wouldn\u2019t mean you would be able to be around your nice or any newborn. It is not some sort of magic.\n\nYou did help, you did donate expensive stuff, you could have sell everything and maybe you would have the money for therapy.\n\nPlus nobody should be forced to help someone or to be around someone.

Phone calls and text messages, emails and hand-written cards, care packages or premade meal that you send with someone else.\n\nI think your mom may mean well. She wants you to support your niece but maybe also wants her own daughter (you) to be better. I imagine it breaks her heart a bit to not be able to help/heal you. \n\nQuiet 1-1 conversations however you can manage them and another compassionate therapist may help you find some coping mechanisms.", "I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through. \n\nNTA.

You do not have to live like this.", "NTA, but as everyone else has said. Please seek therapy. \n\nIt's only going to get worse from here, and it's unrealistic to think you can avoid every baby and pregnant lady in the world. What are you going to do when your boys grow up and have babies of their own? Seek help if not for yourself, your children and your future grandchildren. I promise it will get better, but you have to try first.", "NTA\n\nPlease do put yourself on that waiting list for the therapy, OP. 2 years go quickly, and then you can get help. You will want to be able to be there in the future for your DILs, and PTSD needs to be treated to go away. I know because I've had it. \n\nYou can't help your niece right now, but there are other family members who can, so just let it go. Maybe you might be able to explain this on the phone to her. She might understand, even if your mother doesn't. And please put boundaries for your mother. You're an adult, and she is not allowed to control you like this. She is TA.", "I am sorry for your loss and the trauma you have been through.  I don't know if this is really an AITA question. As many have stated you need therapy, as you stated it is a long waiting list to get this help. Have  you looked into online resources for help? We live in an age where a counselor doesn't  have to necessarily be in your area but things can be done online, with online video appointments.  Have you looked to see if there are any support groups around?  Your niece I hope is understandable after your experience but she may feel hurt that you are avoiding her especially with the hormones of pregnancy. Maybe you can find another way to show her support send her letter or small gifts that let her know you are indeed thinking about her and wishing her the best.", "Gentle YTA. You need therapy and your niece needs your support. What happens if you ever get grandkids? You need to get this sorted ASAP.", "NAH but you should definitely try to contact a therapist ASAP.

This is a tough one for me. I was born at 24 weeks back in the 80s. I too stopped breathing once I was finally allowed home and my mum had to get me breathing again. More than once. And she was young too.\nShe is still traumatised by all of these things. I have personally witnessed this. But if my girlfriend and I present her with a grandchild she would explode with love and happiness. Show her any baby actually and she melts. \nIt's understandable.

Although it would be great if you could be there for her in person, you have supported her in other ways, and since they know why you can't see her, her immediate family should be supporting her and not putting more emotional pressure on you - your sister is a mom too and should be prepared to help her through this. You said your mom doesn't understand why you 'feel this way' - it's clear that it's a psychological PTSD reaction you face when triggered, and not that you feel some kind of way about pregnancies/babies/mothers. It's good that you're on the waiting list for counselling but in the meantime it won't help anyone if they force you to see her, just create more trauma. Encourage your mom to learn more about PTSD and involuntary psychological reactions before telling you how you should feel. Just because your baby ultimately survived doesn't negate how frightening it must have been or how anxious it might have made you. Also, if they need you to explain any doctor lingo etc then maybe you could help over the phone/text, rather than having to be there in person?", "If you have the opportunity beforehand to see another therapist who doesn\u2019t specialize in trauma- or if the therapist you want specializes in trauma around kids specifically and there are trauma specialists in your country- please consider starting sooner. I say this as someone with C-PTSD and a conversion disorder- it takes time to get to the point of being ready to dig into the traumatic stuff. A therapist now could help you handle the feeling of guilt with your niece, establishing boundaries and healthy communication with your mom, and generally prepare you for the more in depth work that you\u2019ll do with the specialist. Plus, it won\u2019t feel as \u201cnew\u201d to be working with the specialist if you try out a therapist or three. \n\nYou really are amazing. Seriously, that you dealt with the issues in your first pregnancy and decided to have more kids? That alone makes you pretty bad ass. My best friend dealt with a similar dilation issue that became a C section, and between that and her baby not being a very chill baby, she has said no more kids. You are a warrior! It\u2019s okay that you need support to handle this next battle. If there\u2019s any support you can SAFELY manage like phone calls, notes, texting- distance support, advice- then offer it.

It is unfair for your mom to decide that this is your responsibility.  It is cruel of her to try to force the issue and surprise you with your niece's presence at events. I know I do better when I can prep myself to be around pregnant people. But that's the result of therapy. \n\nYour mom needs to understand that just because she doesn't get to decide how traumatic events affected YOU. Next time she says something about how you SHOULD feel or what you SHOULD be doing tell her that as your mother SHE should be kind and supportive to you.

I've been in my online group for 6 or 7 years now. It helps having friends who know your grief and understand but therapy was a vastly different kind of help. It was specialized to me and my situation. \n\nAlso, meds don't necessarily fix things either. And you have to be willing to jump through the hoops to find the right one(s). It can take months to get the right doses and combinations and the wrong ones can make things worse. You have to be prepared mentally to go through that, it can be absolutely exhausting. \n\nOP has been trying to handle this on her own and she feels like she's wrong for feeling the way she does. Guilt and shame add another hurdle to getting treatment. You feel like you SHOULDN'T need it and are wrong for doing so or possibly taking a spot from someone who \"deserves\" it more because their trauma was \"worse.\" \n\nAs far as I can tell she's been trying to push through it and only realized she can't do it alone once this situation with the niece came up.

In fact things like CBT that are commonly offered in those resources due to their simplicity can be harmful for people dealing with things like trauma, since they center around irrational unfounded beliefs about yourself and the world, whereas trauma is a response based on very real experiences that need to be processed.", "You\u2019re NTA, you\u2019re healing.

Also there is the PTSD forum on Reddit that could give you more information. \n\nAlso, NTA.", "I understand trauma therapy is different. But starting therapy while o. A 2-year waitlist is better than no therapy at all. I have a trauma therapist for DV and for multiple miscarriages but having a therapist before going to a trauma therapist was still incredibly helpful. I didn't know there *were* designated trauma therapists when I first entered therapy for these. Even opening up at all to a therapist is cathartic and can give a person usable coping tools. Turning to an online trauma therapist in the meantime can ba an option for OP as well. Either way, 2 years is way to long to wait to deal with her issues. And shutting out anything that might trigger a reaction is no way to live. She has to be in public sometime, and the world can't cater to her.", "That\u2019s a broad and IMO not easily justifiable statement. \n\nThe EU is an association of 27 very different countries with all the geographical, language, and systemic barriers that implies. Just because there are cooperative provisions at EU level doesn\u2019t mean practical help is available when it comes to cross border treatment. Each competent authority will have its own rules.", "But the youngest kid is 5 - in the Netherlands the waiting lists are pretty bad for mental health care, but it\u2019s more like 1-1,5 year than 4+.", "True but unspecialized in the case of trauma is almost always unqualified.", "Call your neice and explain the situation. Tell her you wish her well and you are trying to get help. Call her often if you can\u2019t physically see her. Y\u2019all people need to stop judging til y\u2019all walked a day In Her shoes. Just write or call honey she will understand.", "*etc.", "As a fellow PTSD patient I have a lot of empathy, triggers are triggers. You can\u2019t help that your trigger is inconvenient to your family and I feel for you. \n\nIdeally you\u2019d be in therapy, not having a specialty therapist available is a shitty situation. What a lot of people dont understand is that the idea that any therapist is better than no therapist at all is simply not true for most ptsd patients.\n\nI\u2019d suggest 2 things:\n\nReach out to your doctor. Therapy might not be an option right now, but meds can be very helpful. I have some I take daily and one I use only for acute panic attacks. Meds allow me to function fairly well and might be useful for you. It\u2019s worth looking into.\n\nI\u2019d also look for support groups. A support group might help you find ways yo cope and might help you find new useful ways of describing your diagnosis to your family. New language might help them understand what you\u2019re experiencing better. Support groups are also typically led by someone with training and while not a specialist it might help.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame you are carrying such a heavy emotional load. I hope you\u2019re able yo get the support and treatment that you need. Be proud of the small victories as you have them and be kind when you\u2019re in a rough patch. I\u2019d send a hug if I could, good luck.", "NTA. \nYou went through an awful lot. Maybe you should call or email your niece, and tell her your thoughts - that you love her, and hope she has a wonderful pregnancy and a healthy baby, but that it's very hard for you to be around her because of your past.", "Nta, I lost my daughter, she was 3, the ptsd from finding your child unresponsive is intense. It can draw you back, it\u2019s reasonable to feel that. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t lose your son. Your feelings are valid", "I'm not sure where you are, but Better Help has therapists who work with clients all over the world. While online therapy isn't ideal, it may be helpful for the time being.", "I feel for your trauma. You've had a hellish time. Well done on saving your son's life.. \n\nIn these comments you've said \"she knows, everyone in the family knows\" and \"she seems to be okay with it\" and that gives me the sense that maybe you haven't talked with her directly and openly about it?\n\nIf you feel that you're able, it would be good to communicate as directly as possible with your niece (phone, if you can talk with someone you know is pregnant but you can't see her - would that be feasible? mobile chat? email? handwritten letter?), explain to her as much as you're comfortable sharing, and find out directly how she's feeling. Your feelings and trauma, and her feelings, are the important ones here. Other people including your mum have to play second fiddle.", "To be fair. I am in extremely priveliged position of living in Sweden. We have high quality physical and mental care options across ever border except the Russian one", "Your mother is an INSENSITIVE A-HOLE, tell her about your legitimate PTSD and hurts you too much to want to be around anyone including your niece if she doesn't get it then you can go permanent no contact because she is hugely insensitive to your feelings", "I quit my job as a paramedic bc I have PTSD from my daughter almost dying. You\u2019re NTA", "TLDR but more people should ignore pregnants, then maybe they will learn their lesson", "Definitely NTA. You are setting appropriate boundaries for your mental health at this time. It is much more important for you to be able to care for your own children by setting these boundaries than for you to take care of your adult niece. I\u2019m sorry for your difficult experiences, and that your mom is\u2026 kind of an a-hole, honestly. Remember this is temporary, and you\u2019ll be able to get help for these feelings eventually.", "NTA", "NTA... Not in any way. I'm so sorry for your loss, your difficultues and the trauma you went thru. And I'm sorry that your family doesn't understand. \n\nI'm certainly not a therapist. But you seem to have an understanding of why you feel the way you do and you said you were trying to get into therapy, which is great!\n\nI think you're making the best of the situation and it's completely understandable. I think, in my non therapist thoughts, that you're doing a great job and you sound like a very strong woman. Please don't feel otherwise.", "Why does her niece need specifically OP's support? OP definitely needs to deal with these feelings for her own well-being, but I don't understand why there isn't anyone else that can support the niece at this time", "Not everyone is in the US. BetterHelp has border limitations and is considered in professionals circles to be low end/acceptable for general therapy, but NOT acceptable for any sort of PTSD.", "This would be terrible for so many reasons- say she has a terrible response just seeing her and doesn't even make it past a couple of seconds \n\nThere are now 2 distressed and traumatized women- the one whose PTSD was triggered without someone to walk her through the attack in a healthy manner and the *pregnant* woman whose hormones already fuck with her emotions and will not have the bandwidth or capacity to process a PTSD episode", "Have you ever looked into therapy for PTSD? Or just coping mechanisms? This is a seriously fucked up history you have. My heart goes out to you. I understand wanting/needing to wait for the specialist. But maybe a licensed therapist who specializes in PTSD can help find exercises to help with the panic attacks and flashbacks?", "Everyone has their own opinion.  However, there are other avenues. Let's not be completely negative or defeatist. Damn!!", "Thanks to an unspecialized therapist who didn't know anything about autism/adhd, let alone how it presented in girls, telling my mother that I was just 'spoiled' when I was six, I didn't get proper assistance or diagnosis until I was 18, and I'm still unraveling the damage that caused at 30+ thanks to my mom trusting that the guy knew what he was talking about because he was a therapist and thus 'knew what he was talking about.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can only imagine how much worse the damage the wrong therapist could do in OP's situation would be.", "Try not being toxically positive. It's an incredibly unhealthy trait to force others to death with.", "These things can be tricky. My son was in virtual speech therapy and we had to reschedule an appointment because we were going to be out of state. We didn't think it would be a problem, it's virtual, but she said she wasn't allowed to do appointments if we crossed state lines", "I have complex ptsd and due to a lack of therapists in my area specializing in my particular cocktail of trauma and insurance I had three therapists in a short span of time that managed to do the exact opposite of help. \n\nI have a great therapist now and I swear she spent the first six months treating the trauma caused by the others.", "There's a difference between unqualified and not specialized. A specialist will be able to provide more specific coping mechanisms and advise, a run of the mill therapist will at the very least provide a safe space to discuss and work through the trauma.

Thanks for the info - useful to know :)", "In 5+ years she couldn\u2019t get help? \n\nNah dude.

I feel like a soft YTA, sometimes we give in to our trauma because its the easiest way. Life happens, I had my sister loss her baby infront of our eyes and had many incidents like death of loved ones that can cause trauma in our family happened, only time can heal those with a therapy but you need to try working on that by yourself to. If you believe you have strong support around you and everything does happen for a reason and good faith that reason is for a higher purpose, you know that life goes on and sometimes letting go and push out of your comfort zone is the better action. You dont know how strong you are until you try and you might not need all these therapist and to actually sort your own mindset yourself.", "NTA, and it\u2019s good you\u2019re waiting for a specialist.
