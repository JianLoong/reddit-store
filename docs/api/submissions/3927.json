However she happened to end up with Kyle, maybe she'll feel validated, and looking for a 'congratulations' from you is her way of seeking your blessing (you don't owe it to either of them).   \n* Ella is also stirring the pot a little, because there was no need for name calling.

This whole situation seems to hurt you alot still. It shouldn't be that way. You don't need to fake being happy for them, but you should work on yourself and on your mental health so that it just doesn't bother you anymore. \nYou sound like you still love him - and that is okay! May be an unpopular opinion. But see, your heart is not so small that only one man can find his place. You can, it's your right, hold onto the memory and love you shared and be happy about this past. But you can also at the same time look forward, look at other men, find another human that you can love so dearly. And find your peace with what happened in the past, find peace with the fact that it is over and belongs into the past. Once you reach that point, it will be easy for you to be happy for him, that he found a girl, a woman he loves and who loves him back the way you know he deserves, maybe even a future wife that shares life with him and makes him happy the way you know he deserves.

When you have a newborn, to be preoccupied with rubbing it in your boyfriend\u2019s ex\u2019s face, that\u2019s just a whole next level of sorts. Honestly, after having a baby, I\u2019d expect all your thoughts would be lovingly consumed with the new member of your family. To be more preoccupied with making an ex jealous over enjoying all the firsts you get with a newborn, it\u2019s just sad that she\u2019s more focused on her bf\u2019s ex than her baby.", "OP lives rent free in Ella's mind.

When I left my ex, I didn't follow anything he did after that even with friends still in common. I don't know if he had other girlfriends after me, got married after our divorce, had kids, nothing.

Why on on earth would anyone think you would congratulate them? Why would anyone think you want anything at all to do with them?\n\nShe wants you to be jealous.", "NTA but why are you still in contact with these people? Honestly, I'd respond by going \"oh, shit. I didn't realize I was still friends with you on Facebook. Thanks for letting me know. I'll rectify that immediately.\" Then you remove and block them. Save screenshots if you happen to maintain mutual friends and ignore it unless one of them brings it up.

You are not / never were friends with Ella. She\u2019s just some random girl who came into the picture. She broke up your relationship and I can almost guarantee their relationship is rocky at best. Chances are this is a \u201csave the relationship\u201d baby. So she\u2019s reaching out to you to try to rattle you to make herself feel better. Don\u2019t fall for it. Jenna is right. You have nothing to say to them and you don\u2019t owe them anything. Block both her and the ex on everything. They aren\u2019t your friends. That friend group is also not your friends. You\u2019ve been avoiding them for how long and no one has reached out to you? Jenna is a real one.

What entitles you to be happy for them, a friend group?  \n\nLife goes on, you are moving on.

She\u2019s absolutely right: you don\u2019t owe anyone anything, less of all, Ella and your ex.", "NTA. I could understand her hurt if you were saying rude/mean things about them and the baby to their friends but you just stayed out of it. Her message was completely uncalled for. It's nice you want to remain cordial but I would continue staying out of it if I were you. Thankfully you have Jenna and y'all can just do your own thing and hopefully find a new friend group.", "NTA he\u2019s your ex why would you congratulate him? Someone really needs to tell Ella to not boss others around. And plus he cheated on you with Ella why should you congratulate him for his newborn?", "Why the hell are they taking tally of who congratulated them on their baby? NTA", "NTA. Block her and your ex. She is clearly delusional and way to full of herself. No one is owed a congratulations or acknowledgment from an ex. That is ridiculous", "He broke up with you. You owe him nothing - \n\nYes, the baby is innocent - the baby also has no clue if you visit or not. This is a power trip from Ella (and possibly Kyle) - they aren't people worth your time.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m guessing Ella and ex aren\u2019t doing too hot and this is a save the relationship baby. She\u2019s just trying to hassle op as a flex and to make sure she knows the baby from the ex exists. The girl is majorly insecure and is looking for ways to prove to herself she\u2019s better than op. She clearly isn\u2019t better if she has to harass op about a baby she has nothing to do with.

Tell them you are concerned to have Ella contacting you about the baby and that she may need to see her doctor for a PPD screening. There's really no reason for her to be contacting all of the ex's about baby congratulations. \n\nEither she gets help that she needs or family will start watching her like a hawk to be helpful and OP will be living rent free in Ella's head. \n\nUsually new mothers are trying to get sleep, not contacting every option they believe need to congratulate them", "This ^^^ is the perfect response"]}
