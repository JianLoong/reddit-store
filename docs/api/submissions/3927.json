Ella is nuts. I can\u2019t imagine caring what my partner\u2019s ex thinks about my new baby. If I was her, I\u2019d be annoyed if you contacted your ex. Even to say congrats.", "NTA. Why did she go out of her way to message you about a congratulations that you didn't give? That's very weird", "Why do they even need a congratulations? What difference could it possibly make? Im unclear why you're even in contact with them though. It's perfectly normal to just...stop telling to your ex. NTA though.", "NTA\n\n1. Posting a grats isn't for the baby\n2. Who the hell contacts a SOs ex to demand a grats?\n\nThat girl is unstable and unsure of the strength of her relationship", "NTA.. but I don\u2019t understand why Ella\u2019s so upset. You\u2019re an ex who wants to maintain distance.. it\u2019s been a year and you haven\u2019t had any contact or interactions with them, why would Ella expect a sudden change? And honestly, Jenna shouldn\u2019t have messaged Ella. It\u2019s between the two of you and Jenna inserting herself into it just creates more drama than necessary. Jenna is right though, you owe Kyle and Ella nothing", "NTA. Super weird for Ella to be hyper-focused on whether you kissed the ring right after she had a baby. \n\nYou have no obligation to do anything for your ex whatsoever, including calm his current gf's massive insecurities.", "nta. you have nothing to do with kyle anymore, he should simply be a stranger to you. from what you've implied here i believe you never knew ella before kyle got with her, so it makes no sense that she's demanding you to congratulate her, when she's a literal stranger to you.", "NTA Ella is way out of line, you dont owe any of them anything.", "NTA- if this is what I think it is. You don\u2019t owe your ex any time. However, it sounds like maybe Ella is closely related to you? (Good friend, family member) because in my opinion, if they aren\u2019t that close, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any reason to have a connection with them on social media/phone contacts, etc. \n\nNone of my exes called, or texted me when I had a kid and I thought nothing of it.", "ugh nta\n\nhard nta\n\nblock block block\n\new to all of this", "NTA that\u2019s weird she went out of her way to message you that. You don\u2019t need to congratulate them. It sounds like you don\u2019t really have contact with them.", "Nta, they should get an idea that you kind of moved on  from them and should not be your responsibility what so ever to congratulate them. However idk if there's more to the story or information between you and them.", "NTA.  It's weird for Ella to want you to be in contact with your ex.", "NTA. Where in the world does she think is alright to do what she did? You are the ex. You are not obligated to speak to them. Nvm congratulating on the birth. She is a insecure, jealous, petty girl trying to rub it in that she not only got the man but also the baby. Like come on. \n\n\"Congratulations \"what's her name\" on having your vagina getting stretched to extreme and distorted from pushing a little human out of it (crossed fingers the baby was big). I hope the birth was memorable\".", "NTA. That is completely unrealistic, and you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. I\u2019m glad you have Jenna on your side.", "Somethings to consider:    \n\n\n* Kyle is not a such a great prize.  He dropped you in a heartbeat and moved on to Ella.  While break ups are painful he doesn't deserve to take up any more of your time or space in your mind and heart.   \n* Ella is probably a little threatened by you.  However she happened to end up with Kyle, maybe she'll feel validated, and looking for a 'congratulations' from you is her way of seeking your blessing (you don't owe it to either of them).   \n* Ella is also stirring the pot a little, because there was no need for name calling.  If you all were friends, then maybe she's the \"heartless B\" as she put it for not leveling with you first when she decided to get with Kyle.     \n\n\nYou won't owe Ella and Kyle anything. Not even a congratulatory text.  What's more, they don't deserve it.   Don't let these two continue to negatively impact your well-being.     \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  But why the hell are you in contact with them? they both should be blocked", "Nta. Why would you congratulate them if you havent spoken to or seen them since they got together? In my personal opinion she wanted to rub it in and try to hurt you more. Time to find a new friend circle or cut it to just the one.", "Simply block them both?", "NTA, Jenna is 100% right about this greedy, overreaching demand! They don't need anything from you, and this woman doesn't have any right to call you names for living your life and looking after your heart. \n\np.s., chin up, you deserve love and will find it with friends like Jenna at your side.", "NTA. Sounds like Ella is either pretty insecure and is trying to reassure herself by marking her \u2018territory\u2019 or is just a petty immature idiot. \n\nEither way, she is in the wrong.", "NTA. These people are not your friends. Either unfriend or mute them from social media and move on. You have lots of time to make new friends. Remove toxic people from your life. Ella can go suck it, ignore her, she should be focused on the newborn not you, that\u2019s weird!", "NTA. You are no longer friends with these people, you don't need to be a part of their lives. You need to unfriend/ unfollow/ block Kyle and Ella, and continue moving on with life.", "NTA. Since Ella has been alive has she told every person who has given birth or adopted congratulations? Because she\u2019s 14 years late for me. How about the rest of y\u2019all? Has Ella reached out to you (basically a complete stranger bc OP barely knew her) to tell you congratulations?", "You don\u2019t owe Ella shit.  NTA.\n\nAlso- why is she tripping about her baby daddy\u2019s ex when she has a newborn and an outpouring of support from others?  Obsessed much?", "Congratz on living rent free on your ex's gf head, She is screaming insecurity\n\nNTA", "NTA. These people aren\u2019t your friends, block and delete them and move on. You don\u2019t need to congratulate or anything.", "Block Kyle. Block Ella. Keep Jenna. With Jenna make new better friends. NTA", "NTA \n\nThat is so weird of her to send that. You don\u2019t need to send congratulations to an ex. \n\nAnd honey, why do you still have him on Facebook? Please block him and Ella. You don\u2019t need them on your news feed whatsoever. \n\nAlso, keep Jenna but go ahead and start finding new friends to add to your group.", "Nta but please block your ex & his girl. Get new friends except for Jenna. Jenna is a gangster & definitely a friend for life.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird to expect an ex that has no relationship with you to offer any positive words. Someone else's ex, on top of that? So weird. Block. Block them all.", "Ok \n\nAssuming you don't talk to them why would now. \nSharing few friends doesn't mean you have to like them. \n\nYour not wrong, you don't need to wish them well etc\n\nElla is only wrong in this need to be congratulated by you. She like a bloke who was single when they got together. (Idiotic maybe) \n\nEx although a bit of an a** didn't do anything wrong he decided he was interested in someone else, he left and didn't cheat, I'm also assuming he wasn't abusive before he left. I will give he could have waited a bit but you guys are in your early 20's your not thinking like that generally.", "NTA , but it seems to me that even after all this time, you are not able to accept this break up and that it is over with him. This whole situation seems to hurt you alot still. It shouldn't be that way. You don't need to fake being happy for them, but you should work on yourself and on your mental health so that it just doesn't bother you anymore. \nYou sound like you still love him - and that is okay! May be an unpopular opinion. But see, your heart is not so small that only one man can find his place. You can, it's your right, hold onto the memory and love you shared and be happy about this past. But you can also at the same time look forward, look at other men, find another human that you can love so dearly. And find your peace with what happened in the past, find peace with the fact that it is over and belongs into the past. Once you reach that point, it will be easy for you to be happy for him, that he found a girl, a woman he loves and who loves him back the way you know he deserves, maybe even a future wife that shares life with him and makes him happy the way you know he deserves. And at that time you can also find peace with ella.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
