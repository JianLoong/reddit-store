You don\u2019t owe your ex any time. However, it sounds like maybe Ella is closely related to you?

However she happened to end up with Kyle, maybe she'll feel validated, and looking for a 'congratulations' from you is her way of seeking your blessing (you don't owe it to either of them).   \n* Ella is also stirring the pot a little, because there was no need for name calling.  If you all were friends, then maybe she's the \"heartless B\" as she put it for not leveling with you first when she decided to get with Kyle.     \n\n\nYou won't owe Ella and Kyle anything.

I will give he could have waited a bit but you guys are in your early 20's your not thinking like that generally.", "NTA , but it seems to me that even after all this time, you are not able to accept this break up and that it is over with him. This whole situation seems to hurt you alot still. It shouldn't be that way. You don't need to fake being happy for them, but you should work on yourself and on your mental health so that it just doesn't bother you anymore. \nYou sound like you still love him - and that is okay! May be an unpopular opinion. But see, your heart is not so small that only one man can find his place. You can, it's your right, hold onto the memory and love you shared and be happy about this past. But you can also at the same time look forward, look at other men, find another human that you can love so dearly. And find your peace with what happened in the past, find peace with the fact that it is over and belongs into the past. Once you reach that point, it will be easy for you to be happy for him, that he found a girl, a woman he loves and who loves him back the way you know he deserves, maybe even a future wife that shares life with him and makes him happy the way you know he deserves.
