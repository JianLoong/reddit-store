A few streets down my house, like 300 m, we pass by a house where suddenly a big australian or belgian shepherd suddenly runs out towards us. We are across the street from the house and I see a tiny asian woman round the corner going after her dog it seemed like she didn't see us. Her dog goes over to Sue and starts trying to play but Sue is scared and tries to walk away but her dog keeps going at Sue.\n\nI keep calling Sue to come but she's just scared and as soon as the woman reaches us Sue runs away scared and her dog runs after mine. I run after them and see two cars almost hit the dogs luckily we are in a residential area so they didn't drive fast and saw the dogs in time. They round a corner a street before our house where a family is playing outside but just as I round the corner, they had made a loop back so I turn around and the woman is running behind me. I yell at her to get a grip on her dog and she retorts I know, dont talk to me that way. Eventually I hear Sue barking from our house. She had ran into the garden and the other dog had followed her.\n\nMy wife and teenage son helped me get a hold of the dog and Sue. All three of us, my wife and son barefoot in their pyjamas, walk back with the dog on the leash. A few meters from the house I hear running behind me and it's the asian lady.\n\nI immediately gave her a piece of my mind tell her she should control her dog and its not ~~fucking~~ ok and she says that it's an unlucky situation and I cut her off and told her IDC ~~IDGAF.~~ She tells me to drop my tone and stop talking down to her and I tell her to put her dog on a leash. She says that's dumb when the dog is at their house and its just unlucky she didn't see us and they were actually on the way back in the house backdoor when the dog ran after Sue and that it's a puppy so she's sorry but I still shouldnt talk down to her. I told I dont ~~gaf~~ care and that she shouldnt have a dog not on a leash if she cant control it even on her property. She kept saying she understood I was angry but she wont accept being talked down to. I tell her Im angry and good for her for being able to control her feelings and tone of voice but I lost a dog 3 years ago and I wont accept losing another one because some ~~dumbass~~ one cant control their dog, i can call my dog back to me but because of her dog scaring Sue she ran away. She says again she understands and its an unfortunate situation she couldnt control and do more about but she wont accept me talking down to her. I said then dont have a dog then and whatever.\n\nShe said thanks for bringning my dog and I tell her yeah someone had to when you couldnt even call it back to you. My wife asked if she needed help and she said no thank you, as long as there aren't other dogs it usually listens to her. I laughed in her face. My wife thinks I was a bit harsh for the way I talked to her and embarrassed her infront of strangers like my family and another neighbor washing the car and the other neighbors.\n\nedit: grammar and paragraphs\n\nedit: Sorry I can see how the swear words can be misconstrued. I was typing this in anger and was more of venting on here. **I didnt actually use the word fuck when speaking to her. I did not curse her out.** At most I said \"You dont have damn control of your dog\"\n\nedit: There arent leash laws here like the US. People always assume reddit happens in the states but anyway in my country it is completely legal to have your dog unleashed as long as it is not a danger to others, you only need to leash it in the public park, city and beach. It is on the other hand ILLEGAL to have a dog you can not control, a dog that attacks other dogs or people, or a dog that leaves your property and goes into other people's property without permission (which hers did)\n\nedit: last edit hopefully, I told her I accept her apology but still scolded her being a irresponsible dog owner\n\nedit: I guess not. Please stop abusing the Reddit Care feature to harass me. And also, please stop sending me harassing private messages insulting me.", "created_utc": 1686483689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146rt9k/aita_yelling_at_my_neighbor_because_of_her_dog/", "score": 51, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her dog being off leash was an accident. Your dog being off leash wasn't. Nobody cares is you can 'normally' control your dog off leash. The leash is there because of those times you can't... like this one. Plus the lady apologized and you kept criticizing her, making you both an asshole and a hypocrite.", "YTA, pot meet kettle. You can't lecture someone on having a dog off leash and not having proper recall when yours doesn't either. \n\nAlso why mention the other owners ethnicity? It has absolutely zero to do with any of this. All you had to say is the other owner, the woman walking the dog etc", "Your dog, Sue, was also off leash. YTA.", "So your dog wasn't on a leash, apparently doesn't have perfect recall, and you were off your property with her. But you're screaming at someone else who's dog was on their property when this all started? If your dog had been leashed, you could've just picked her up and protected her before the big puppy got there.\n\nThe leash isn't just for control, but also for protection. You have more control (and are better able to protect) if you can get a hold of your dog fast.\n\nQuestion: You mentioned that the woman was Asian and smaller than you. Are you more comfortable screaming at smaller people? Are Asian people particularly easy to scream at because of stereotypes and size? Asian women in particular? \n\nIt sure sounds like she was trying to manage your emotions for you. Try being less emotional next time. Tantrums are for toddlers.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. YOU should have had YOUR dog on a leash. If you\u2019d had Sue on a leash, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to run away in the first place there wouldn\u2019t have been a chase,  and the lady would have had an easier time grabbing her dog. Yes her dog wasn\u2019t on a leash but she was bringing the dog inside from their yard so unfortunately it happened.\n\nThe way you spoke to her is even worse. From what I read, her goal was to fix the situation. It seems like your goal was giving her a piece of your mind. Unless you left something out, it seems you were the only one who was swearing and yelling. That\u2019s completely inappropriate.", "YTA, your dog was off leash and off property.  Her dog ran from her property.  If your dog was on a leash she never would have made it to the street.  My dog is very small and follows me closely, but if she gets scared she makes bad choices so I keep the leash on.", "YTA\n\nYou caused this situation as much, if not more, then the other lady by having a dog off leash who ignored your commands. Your excuses about the dog being too scared to listen to you won't wash; if your dog will ignore your commands for ANY reason, you do not have total control of the dog and it should always be on a leash when off property. Hopefully you'll learn that lesson after this incident.\n\nYour disgusting rant to a woman who came to apologise for her dog *escaping* her property and following your dog home was just vile. She did nothing wrong, her dog *escaped*. She immediately came after it, and tried to take ownership for the mistake. And your response? Not only are you a hypocrite, you're also incredibly rude and aggressive. Sort yourself out, because your behaviour here was completely unacceptable from start to finish.", "YTA - Your dog was off-leash and you had the audacity to tell the other person *her* dog should've been on a leash when it had been at her house and, for all you know, snuck out past the owner on pure accident? That's just plain hypocritical. Her dog being off a leash and getting out seems like an accident. You having your dog off a leash was both on purpose *and* irresponsible.  Leash your dog if you're walking them in a public neighborhood. Period.", "YTA for the way you talked to the lady.   \nYelling at the lady and talking down to her is rude as hell was going over board especially since you also had your dog off the leash and had no control over your dog.   \nI don't think it's fair to yell at one person for not having their dog on a leash while yours was also off leash and you obviously can't control your dog either.", "Yeah wow.  \nYou have the shits because she cannot control her dog but you cannot control hers?\n\nFor a start, don't yell, be the big person and converse.\n\nControl YOUR dog then expect the same from others.\n\nYTA", "Hypocrite, YTA", "YTA and everyone, we are in the company of a narcissist. \n\nNothing we say will get her to admit she was wrong for letting her dog off leash, because nothing she does is wrong.\n\nShe will have excuses until December on why it not her fault.", "But, you weren\u2019t controlling your dog either?  And everything you yelled at her, also applies to you.  YTA.", "I had a Pomeranian and as well behaved as he was \"normally,\" his recall was horrendous.  \nRegardless of where we were, he was *always* on a leash.  \nNot because he was vicious or aggressive, but because he was little(15 pound throwback) and I needed the ability to bring him back to me immediately in case of something like this happening.  \nHe was allowed off leash in three places. The dog park, in the house, and in my fenced backyard.  \nYTA, for caring so little about your dog that you were not prepared for something like this happening.  \nThat poor woman was trying to get her puppy in the house. You were on a nature walk with yours. There's a huge difference.  \nYou can try to blame whoever you want for this situation, but at the end of the day, *YOU* are responsible for *YOUR* dog *and* its behavior.", "YTA - Leashes are required for a reason.", "YTA - you can only ask someone to leash their dog if your dog is on-leash. Talking about the pot calling the kettle black!", "YTA. My man, your dog was ALSO off the leash, and you\u2019re yelling at the lady for doing literally the same thing you\u2019re doing? You\u2019re a massive hypocrite, and I\u2019m willing to bet you wouldn\u2019t have spoken to another grown man like that. GTFO.", "YTA with a heavy dose of E S H. There is a reason for leashes, and you just found it. I noticed in your responses above that you said you can normally control your dog. Leashes aren\u2019t there for \u2018normal\u2019. They\u2019re there for PRECISELY THIS SITUATION. And then you doubled down by cursing this woman for doing the exact same thing you were doing. Leashes would have prevented all of this. They are there as much to protect your dog as they are to protect others, especially if you have a small dog. \n\nFor your dog\u2019s sake, please get a leash.", "YTA for how you spoke to her. ESH because if both dogs were on leashes none of this would of happened.", "YTA your dog should have been on leash too.", "YTA you should\u2019ve put your dog on leash as soon as you saw the other dog approach.", "YTA - don\u2019t walk your dog off leash", "YTA for not having Sue on a leash - you are an entitled hypocrite. And YTA for noting the race of the woman. What has that got to do with literally anything?", "YTA. You started the problem by walking your dog off leash. Then you proceeded to bully the neighbor and just be mean for the sake of it. Your fault.", "YTA. Off leash dogs make me so aggravated. I have two reactive dogs that I can\u2019t take out anymore (always leashed) because people let their dogs run up to us! People even let their dogs come up to my fenced in back yard and my most aggressive dog will run the fence wanting to fight them. Please keep your dog on a leash!", "YTA  leash your dog. Stop making excuses and \u201cexplaining so we understand\u201d We get the situation and you are still T A. \n\nThe woman was walking her dog back into her house on her own property - I give her a pass on not having a leash on her dog at that precise moment.", "YTA. Why are you yelling at her, you're just as guilty as she is. Both of you had your dogs off leash which is probably not allowed Where You Are. Your dog wouldn't answer when you called, her dog didn't answer when it was called. Your dog took off and her dog took off after it. So look in the mirror and yell at yourself some cuz you are as guilty if not more than she was. If you'd had your dog on a leash you could have just picked her up and that would have finish the problem right then and there. But no you want to walk your dog without a leash which is not a smart thing to do.", "YTA. I don't care if your dog is a perfect angel who won the Westminster Dog Show. She was off-leash and everything you described next is why she should be wearing one.\n\nYou wouldn't put a child in the car without securing them to a car seat. Don't take your dog out of your yard without a leash.", "1. Why do you keep harping on the fact that she\u2019s a small Asian woman? What the hell is the point of that? Making yourself sound racists and sexists. I\u2019m a 4\u201911 white woman and i have 3, guess I shouldn\u2019t be walking them bc I\u2019m a small woman right?\n\n2. You are  THE KING of ASSHOLES!!! Your dog was off leash and you refuse to accept any responsibility for that. Her dog was an accident you purposely don\u2019t have your dog on a leash. Now I\u2019m curious is your dog always off leash and has gone at other dogs before. Bc this is the exact behavior of someone who has problems with their dog being off leash and going at other dogs and has been cited for such.", "YTA in every possible conceivable way. How self important do you have to be to not have your own dog on a leash and then verbally abuse someone for the same. Grow up and stop being so childish. If you had ypur dog on a leash it wouldn't have gotten away from you.", "YTA, because man are you an AH.\n\nIt is simply stunning you do not see the hypocrisy of cursing someone out for not having their dog leashed in their yard **as you walk by on a stroll with your unleashed dog**. \n\nHad your little Pom been on a leash, as it should have been, you could have simply picked it up, event over. But it wasn\u2019t. **Put your dog on a leash.** *(Here, please insert all of the hurtful cursing talking down language you used at that woman\u2026\u2026pointed at you.)*\n\nEDIT to change this is YTA. After seeing your responses, you are just simply being an awful person in regards to this. I tried giving you benefit of the doubt. Your responses have removed all doubt.", "YTA. Just because your dog didn't react the same way as the other dog doesn't mean you are not at fault. Put your damn dog on a leash.", "YTA you do realize if sue was on a leash she wouldn\u2019t have run off right? You would have been able to pick her up and move on. You and sue were just as much active participants in that chaos, as that lady who made a mistake. If you are so concerned about losing another dog, maybe don\u2019t play fast and lose with your current one. Having her on a leash is for her safety. No one dog is perfect and accidents do happen. If sue was hurt in that chose, it would have been on you because you failed to put the necessary things in place to be able to keep her safe.", "YTA - The fact that you found the need to point out that she\u2019s an Asian woman makes me wonder whether that fact played a part in you yelling at her. You say she didn\u2019t have control over her dog. Neither did you. You cant say that your dog usually listens to you so it justifies your anger. Point is she didn\u2019t listen to you this time. You\u2019re in the wrong as well.", "YTA. YOUR dog was off leash. YOUR dog didn't come when called. YOU couldn't control YOUR dog. And YOU'RE a racist.", ">I was walking my dog Sue (pomeranian mix) off leash\n\nYou're an asshole", "YTA. Your recall failed because there was another dog. How are you different to her? You *laughed in her face*? Bullying, ridiculous AH behaviour.", "YTA. You think it is ok for your dog to be off leash, but everyone else is supposed to leash and control their dogs? Do you feel special?", "YTA You have zero recall of your dog, and yet you were yelling at her for having an unleashed dog?! \n\nLol OK!", "Don't even need to read past the first sentence. Put your dog on a leash. YTA.", "YTA.  Keep your dog on a leash.", "YTA. As others have said, you can\u2019t lambast somebody else for doing the exact same thing you did. \n\nSo pleased neither dog was hurt in this scenario. You should actually be thankful to that lady. She\u2019s (well, her dog has) shown you that in stressful situations, Sue\u2019s recall action is ineffective. So from now on keep her on a lead!", "YTA. You preach her to have her dog on a leash on HER property yet walking there without a leash yourself. She was at home, aou weren't. If your dog had a leash this all would have been prevented and the whole chase would be stopped right at the beginning.\n\nYou owe that lady a huge apology.", "Lol YTA. If you had a leash you could have picked Sue up and kept her safe. Without one your dog almost got hit by a car. And you decided to point out she was asian when it was totally irrelevant. That feels like a weird detail to throw in there if it didn't affect your perspective of the story.", "Y a huge AH!! Many years ago I was walking my 7 year old boxer. A couple were walking their two toy breed dogs off leash across the street. Their two dogs start growling and approaching my dog. The man is obviously very surprised and angry as he is calling them and they aren\u2019t listening. I ask him to please come get his dogs as my normally sweet and gentle Dodger took on a terrifying position, straining on his leash, solid as a rock and completely focused on the little dogs coming towards us. The man, in a very condescending way, waves his hand and says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re very friendly.\u201d As I\u2019m asking him to please get his dogs, the little ones are now maybe 2 feet away and start to bark. \nIn one quick motion my boxer does a 180 AND SQUEEZED HIS HEAD OUT OF THE COLLAR!! \nIt was a massacre. He mauled one little dog until the other one barked at him and then he dropped the one he had in his mouth and went after the other one. Now the wife is crying and screaming, I\u2019m begging my dog to come back, the man is crying and yelling, trying to kick and punch my dog (who does an excellent job of outwitting him the whole time). It only ends when a driver stops his car and offers for the lady to pick up her injured dog and get in. She does and then she calls the other little dog who runs to the car and jumps in too. \nThe man is screaming at me that he\u2019s going to sue me for vet bills\u2026.yada, yada, blah, blah blah. \nYTA and you and your untrained dog are lucky your neighbor\u2019s dog only wanted to play. Ugh! Your attitude is so cringy and I hope your dog doesn\u2019t end up paying for it.", "ESH, but more you than her. Neither of you had your dogs on leash, but you are the one yelling about it. Also the fact that you felt compelled to mention the woman is Asian, makes me think you were racist and condescending on how you spoke to her.", "ESH but you\u2019re definitely TA for the way you handled it. You keep saying your dog listens to you but it didn\u2019t. Bottom line. \n\nIf you already know the dangers of uncontrollable dogs, YOU need to leash your dog in public. Who would you have yelled at if the dog was a stray or if a dog accidentally got out and the woman wasn\u2019t there?\n\nThe balls on you to take your anger out on someone with their dog off leash when your own dog was off leash. Grow up and be responsible.", "You called your dog sue?", "YTA this is the pot calling the kettle black because your dog was also off leash and out of your control! You say you can call Sue back to you but obviously that didn\u2019t work, and blaming the other dog for that entirely misses the point - a dog should be on leash because unexpected things happen and the dog can react in unexpected ways. It\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re that irresponsible when you\u2019ve already lost a dog, be better for the sake of your pet!", "YTA.  If your little dog had been on a leash, none of this had to happen.  You could have picked her up and avoided this whole situation.", "YTA and a hypocrit.\n\nYour dog was off least too. You can lament as much as you want about how you have a good recall and that your dog is well trained. When your dog got scared it bolted, into trafic, no less. Thats not having a good recall at all and your dog is a safety hazard off leash as well. What if the cars that had to stop had had to sverve and someone had been hurt? \n\nPeople are chewing you out in the comments because you're being an ass and arguing, btw. Had you just owned up to your recall not being as good as you thought it was and that she would be on leash from now on, you would be fine. Instead you are doubeling down and arguing with people. I get emotions running high, it sounds like a really scary and stressfull situation, but you need to come down of your high horse and own up to your own part in this, so you can take steps to do better for your dog as well.", "What\u2019s her being Asian got to do with anything, I mean why even mention her ethnicity? All dogs off the lead so YTA", "YTA- Your dog was off leash walking the neighborhood and she doesn\u2019t have perfect recall. Your neighbor\u2019s dog was off leash in their yard( their property). Also her race has very little to do with the situation at hand, so why mention it.", "YTA\n\nOthers repeated that you should've leashed your dog, I agree with that but what annoys me more is that you're the exact type of dog owner who gives us a bad rep.\n\nThe ironic part is that I dislike \"dog people\" even more ever since I've gotten my own, it just highlights the entitlement, arrogance and lack of knowledge even more.", "YTA- her dog being off leash was an accident, which can happen to the best of us on occasion. YOU purposefully had your dog off leash and clearly isn\u2019t trained to recall. Do you know why it\u2019s so important to always have your dog on a leash? So when there are accidents like this you are prepared. You\u2019re being bad to your dog by purposely allowing your dog to be off leash and not at all being considerate of the possibilities of accidents around you. Do better for your poor dog", "I genuinely don't understand why people post looking for judgment, then argue with everyone for giving it. \n\nYTA. Your attitude sucks.", "YTA specifically for putting your dog in harm\u2019s way and screaming at a woman doing what you JUST did . I live in rather well off area and a lot of people feel entitled to let their dogs off leash because we live in a nice part of my city . I love doggies , but when they\u2019re out and about off leash it makes me cringe knowing what could happen. If something happened to your dog it\u2019s your fault and your fault only . Always leash your pup , for your dogs safety. You\u2019re being a bad pet parent . Grow up .", "YTA 100%. The dog escaping her property was an accident. Accidents happen. She apologized and knew she was in the wrong. Granted things could\u2019ve gone really bad, but they didn\u2019t. That said, had no right to talk down to her. Who do you think you are? YOU didn\u2019t have a leash on your rat and it was outside your property. This could\u2019ve been prevented too if you put a leash on it.", "ESH\n\nDo you really not see the glaring hypocrisy throughout your whole post? You literally start by saying how you were walking your dog off leash and then spend three paragraphs trashing the other owner for having their dog off leash.\n\nYeah, you both should\u2019ve had better control over your animals. There are 100 things that could have caused your dog to bolt, it just happened to be another dog this time.\n\nAlso, is there a reason you had to call out her race several times? How is that in any way relevant to the story? Is your implication that Asian women shouldn\u2019t own dogs?", "YTA.  I\u2019m a dog owner as well.  Your dog was off leash and an incident occurred. You are just as culpable.  Both of my dogs are usually fine with off leash walking, but aren\u2019t 100% reliable with recall.  Therefore, they will never be walked off leash in an urban environment.\n\nYou claim in the comments your dog is usually good.  Clearly this situation shows that usually isn\u2019t good enough.  Why do you expect everyone else has to keep their dogs leashed when you aren\u2019t bothering to do that?\n\nThe yelling and anger was also an entirely selfish projection of your own fear and insecurity that through your own decision to not use a leash on a walk your dog almost died.", "YTA....Your dog wasn't leashed. PERIOD. so you don't get to berate someone if theirs is too", "YTA for talking to her like that when you were had your own dog off-leash. You were totally irresponsible.  If something happened to your dog, it would have also been your fault for not having control of your own dog. Her dog getting out was an accident. Your lack of control of your own dog was on purpose.

I should have had hold of him and been watching the area better, as I know he can be a bit reactive, and having him sit and know something is coming changes everything.

But you felt a duty to \"scold\" her anyway. If where you live doesn't have leash laws, hers wasn't required to be restrained or contained in any way either.

A few streets down my house, like 300 m, we pass by a house where suddenly a big australian og belgian shepherd suddenly runs out full speed towards us. We are across the street from the house and I see a tiny asian woman round the corner going after her dog it seemed like she didn't see us. Her dog goes over to Sue and starts trying to play but Sue is scared and tries to walk away but her dog keeps going at Sue. I keep calling Sue to come but she's just scared and as soon as the woman reaches us Sue runs away scared and her dog runs after mine. I run after them and see two cars almost hit the dogs luckily we are in a residential area so they didn't drive fast and saw the dogs in time. They round a corner a street before our house where a family is playing outside but just as I round the corner, they had made a loop back so I turn around and the woman is running behind me. I yell at her to get a grip on her dog and she retorts I know, dont talk to me that way. Eventually I hear Sue barking from our house. She had ran into the garden and the other dog had followed her. My wife and teenage son helped me get a hold of the dog and Sue. All three of us, my wife and son barefoot in their pyjamas, walk back with the dog on the leash. A few meters from the house I hear running behind me and it's the asian lady. I immediately gave her a piece of my mind tell her she should control her dog and its not fucking ok and she says that it's an unlucky situation and I cut her off and told her IDGAF. She tells me to drop my tone and stop talking down to her and I tell her to put her dog on a leash. She says that's dumb when the dog is at their house and its just unlucky she didn't see us and they were actually on the way back in the house backdoor when the dog ran after Sue and that it's a puppy so she's sorry but I still shouldnt talk down to her. I told I dont gaf and that she shouldnt have a dog not on a leash if she cant control it even on her property. She kept saying she understood I was angry but she wont accept being talked down to. I tell her Im angry and good for her for being able to control her feelings and tone of voice but I lost a dog 3 years ago and I wont accept losing another one because some dumbass cant control their dog. She says again she understands and its an unfortunate situation she couldnt control and do more about but she wont accept me talking down to her. I said then dont have a dog then and whatever. She said thanks for bringning my dog and I tell her yeah someone had to when you couldnt even call it back to you. My wife asked if she needed help and she said no thank you, as long as there aren't other dogs it usually listens to her. I laughed in her face. My wife thinks I was a bit harsh for the way I talked to her and embarrassed her infront of strangers like my family and another neighbor washing the car and the other neighbors. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Unless the area if deliberately an off-leash zone, like a dog park or your yard, you put your pet and others at risk when they're not leashed in public. \n\nEnd of.", "Does your dog's recall help if a bigger, stronger dog is attacking yours? No. Leash laws are for the protection of everyone. It doesn't matter how well behaved they are. When people don't properly leash and care for their dogs, it's the dogs who suffer. Why even risk it?", "Translation : **the other dog owners were able to restrain their dogs**, so you have an illusion that yours was in control.\n\nYou can spin and twist and turn all you want. You were just as wrong as the woman you screamed at. And now, are ten times worse - she can at least acknowledge she lost control of her dog, you are too dense to even get there. \n\nLawsuit waiting to happen, that\u2019s what you and your little dog are. When you finally get sued for this thing biting a kid or another animal, remember this post.", "It's almost like things can happen sometimes that are out of your control. Wild. You know what could have prevented this? You leashing your dog in public spaces.", "So your dog has been attacked, but this dog that *didn't* attack was more aggressive than a dog that *did* attack? You don't make sense.", "Then why don\u2019t you keep your dog on a leash if it\u2019s been attacked in the past? Sucks to be your dog.", "Sounds like this dog wasn't even being aggressive, just large and over enthusiastic and young. Puppies often don't read body language that well yet and get excited about playing and don't realise how much bigger they are. I had a standard poodle (the big ones) who was like this & needed a lot of training because he was just so enthusiastic about making friends he didn't realise they were running away, not playing chase because he was towering over them.\n\nThere will always be situations in life when dogs, kids, people who can't read animals behaviour and will therefore do things like pat them when they don't want to be pat or try or what ever. As a dog owner it's your responsibility to train them and have control over them.\nMany things can scare or startle a dog and having them run out in traffic or off after another dog, a cat, bird, other pet or child etc is another reason to have them on a lead when they aren't in an enclosed area.\n\nI had one dog I wouldn't trust because it was a terrier that once it caught a scent would take off after it and one that was very well trained but I can't predict what other dogs are going to do on the street or what people will do. One time, totally out of the blue the well trained one just went off at someone & he never did that. Just barking but still.\n\nThey are animals. They are your responsibility.\n\nYou were both in the wrong.\nShe should not have had her dog loose either. \nThe yelling wasn't helpful but I understand how scary it can be to be worried about your dog, especially after losing another animal. My mum had her dogs let out of her yard and one of them got hit by a car. We got the other one back thankfully but I am always paranoid about making sure our gate is shut before letting the dogs out. Fear makes you angry.\nShe felt attacked and from her point of view your dog was just as unrestrained and uncontrolled as her dog so you yelling and attacking her was uncalled for.\nSo I can see why you were both getting upset with each other but I think both of you should have your dogs on leads while outside whether the law requires it or not.", "\u201cOnly a problem if there are other dogs\u201d isn\u2019t that literally exactly what happened with your dog? You can normally control her but then there was another dog so you couldn\u2019t? Also, being able to \u201ckeep up\u201d with your dog, isn\u2019t a normal thing. I have a pretty small dog, but she is rapid, other dogs have trouble keeping up with her. You seem like a hypocrite as your dog was also off the leash, you were way too harsh. YTA", "But you are big and your dog small and your recall failed too. If your dog had trusted you to come to you to be defended, then issue avoided as well. \nYour dog was off leash on a path outside private houses and close to the road. Not in a secure place.\n\nThe woman should have had better control. You should have had better control. Puppy needs socialisation. But it was an unfortunate situation. Thankfully all dogs safe .\n\nEdit: As to the \"normally\", that is all very well. But like seat belts and helmets, leashes are for the abnormal event when your dog startles or faces something new.", "You didn't have an ounce of control, either.  Your dog was off-leash. YTA. If your dog wasn't off leash, none of the rest would have happened. You could have picked her up immediately, and none of the rest would have happened. No matter how you try to defend it, you had your dog off-leash, and that makes YTA.", ">Thats what she claims.\n\nAnd you're claiming the same thing. **Good** dog owners keep their dogs on leashes when in public no matter the size of the dog or the so-called control the owner has.", "That\u2019s what you claim", "And it looked like you didn't have an ounce of control over yours.", "Well, you had no control over your dog, either.", "But it also looks like you didn't have an ounce of control over your dog, who you also had off leash...", "Seems like you didn't have an ounce of control over your dog as well", "ESH but you\u2019re more of TA. Her dog was on her property, and she did make a mistake by not keeping him in an enclosed area, but you also did not have control over your dog. \n\nYour dog deserves for you to do better. Leash laws exist for a reason.", "Yeah I saw one of his replies after I commented where he mentioned this. Still strikes me as weird because I feel like most people would have simply said \"tiny lady\" rather than \"Asian lady\" y'know?", "Except you COULDN'T control your dog.", "\"my bunny bunny would never bite you. IMPOSSIBLE\"\n\nprobably you in a few years.\n\nYou had so much control over your dog he ran all the way back to your house and didn\u00b4t listen to you at all over a period of what? 10-15 minutes?\n\nDo you not see the irony? \"well trained......\"", "Yes, even well trained ones.\n\nWhich yours isn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t return on command, right? Then it isn\u2019t.\n\nI could call my shepherd off chasing a rabbit when I had her (she\u2019s sadly passed). Instant full stop and return. Instant. I could call her off another dog being in her face and being aggressive. Instantly stood down and returned to my side. Leash slacked in under a second. That is well trained. Your dog is not.", "The situation showed you couldn\u2019t control your dog.", "I don't know how the rules are for your country, but here you have to leash your dog walking sidewalks etc.. You saw how fast your dog were away when it was scarred. If your dog got hit by a car and caused damage to the car you are reliable for it. You put your dog and other people in danger because of it.", "It\u2019s not well trained if it didn\u2019t return to you immediately upon recall. The most Irresponsible dog owner here is YOU", "Unless your dog has 100% bombproof recall - she always comes when called no matter the circumstances - she should be on a leash.  \u201cNormally\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, especially in an urban environment where there\u2019s a lot of sudden stimuli. You\u2019ve overestimated her ability to cope when something pushes her boundaries. Take the lesson from this - there are some circumstances where her flight instincts will overwhelm her recall training and she\u2019ll run, so it\u2019s not safe to walk her off leash.", "Beginning to think this is a bs post", "Yes, it would have been. I'm not disagreeing with you here.\n\nHowever, the Aussie is a far larger dog, and could potentially cause physical damage to another smaller dog, especially one as small as a Pom. To give it a chance to bolt after another dog is irresponsible.
