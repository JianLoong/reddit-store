Because of those doctor appointments these individuals are now out of the office more thus losing the company money for time not worked but still getting paid a full salary as if they are working. You are also more prone to injury when you are fat which becomes a liability for the company because if you trip and fall at work and suddenly shatter a bone from the sheer weight of yourself the company can now be sued or have to pay out disability leave.
