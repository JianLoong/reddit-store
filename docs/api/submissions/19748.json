At the same time, I know it would have been hard to shift the topic and still come up with a quick comeback.\n\nProbably the safest thing would have been to not make a joke that brings up size as a topic when there's someone around for whom size seems to be an issue.", "You\u2019re not insecure about your weight but a lot of people on the skinny side are. At least now he\u2019ll think twice before commenting on someone\u2019s weight. \n\nTotally justified imo.", "I don\u2019t think worse necessarily, but I don\u2019t entirely blame you for your response. Was it a good idea? No, but I\u2019d be pretty annoyed by a comment like that and I can totally understand getting back at them", "Does intent not play a factor? I've updated to ESH now as I accept the bosses initial comments could be interpreted badly.", "Then you shouldn't take offence because you aren't skinny any more.\n\nI am also skinny and have bulked up over the last years. People still call me it. I don't mind because in reality it is more a form of admiration IMO. \n\nI understand more if you have had to deal with anorexia but you didn't make that clear before. Can I ask if you were actually personally offended by being called skinny or by the comment your boss made.", "This.", "Trust me I know also. As someone who has floated around the 14-18 BMI most my life I know.", "Yeah I'd like to hear an explanation why they're not the same too!?", "Hopefully it will blow over.", "You said yourself that you're not insecure about your weight, but you know that he is. He shouldn't have said it, and in a manager position he should certainly know better, even if he meant it as a harmless joke. You targeted him with something you know he is insecure about in response to something you admitted to not considering much of an insult. You can and should stick up for yourself. But that's not what you did, you just hit back with an insult. Instead of him looking like the ass to the whole room, you both look immature.", "Nope - actually makes you look worse. Especially because he's the BOSS!", "Insecure people don't get a free pass to be assholes.", "Unless you value your self-respect.", "So, being fat, you are allowed to make fun of other's body shapes. The justification is because of fatphobia.\n\nNo, your argument is completely unacceptable and frankly disgusting. Nobody should be body shamed, and that includes skinny people, too.\n\nEver think they laughed at the boss because the boss went for a low blow and got back what they served.", "That's not logical, AT ALL. Make fun of someone, get made fun of back... yeah that's tit for tat. You think \"skin & bones\" jokes don't exist for skinny people? Nah man, don't be an asshole and not expect to have it done back to you. Boss came at their weight, they came at bosses weight. It's exactly tit for tat.", "They laughed at him because I am not known to fire back, I usually roll over and agree.", ">>you picked on a known insecurity\n\nSo his boss can make fun of him to a group of his peers unprovoked, but OP can\u2019t retort with the same energy? \n\nESH here, because OP is not the only asshole in this situation.", "Prefer self-respect over job. I get you mercenaries out there work for promotions etc, but I work for satisfaction and so I'll happily clap back now. This is a new stance for me.", "Not quite, some colleagues told me it was funny and they're glad I stood up for myself.", "I'm make sure to let you all know, so far nothing has come.", "Ah morality.", "So as long as something happened in the past it's less valid? what if I was skinny(I actually was) in the past and really struggled with it. Perhaps it's better to not make these jokes at all, and I acknowledge my part in it in this instance.", "Woah woah back it up. We are not going to just let heavier slide because you think being skinny is better or okay. Skinny people deal with just as much crap and none sense. He also use to have ED so pay up.", "It\u2019s not okay to call someone a skinny bastard\u2026", "So a comment intended to be jealousy and very much said in an insulting manner is not insulting to you. Glad you think so but I didn't take it that way.", "lol it was not meant in a friendly way, it was meant as an insult.", "Most certainly.", "I hold my self-respect over a job and am confident in my ability to find another if necessary. Though I am privileged in saying this as I save lots of my money and have fortunate circumstances but that also means I can not only have pride but also afford self-respect.", "I think he knew putting me down like that in public would bother me, but he did it anyway. Funny how that works isn't it.", "Why would I quit? I haven't been fired. The net result has been me standing up for myself, my boss unlikely to insult me again because I clap back. And colleagues complimenting me for standing up for myself. It's hard to see how its that bad from my eyes.", "No, but he couldn't have known that, does knowing if someone is insecure about a particular insult change whether or not it should be made?", "There are definitely different philosophies on this. Some would say that with great power comes great responsibility, and in this specific range of battle, the big kid has a hell of a lot more power than the little kid.\n\nIf they were my kids, they would both be in trouble, but I know which one would be getting in a lot more trouble.", "True but couldn't the same be said for him, why would he make that comment if he was sensitive about his own size issues? asking for trouble no?", "Well this is the rub really.", "Fair enough.", "It does but I view it as good intentions bad landing if that be that case. I just can\u2019t see how you seen right past the bastard part. Like that is what really stuck out to me.", "A little bit personally offended because I felt it was my boss using his position to push me down and get some laughs, I have had trouble with sticking up for myself before in the past and decided to fire back.", "We're waiting.", "Indeed, I think it will.", "True that", "I didn\u2019t say anyone is allowed to make fun of body types. I said the boss\u2019s comments were inappropriate. If you\u2019re not going to practice good reading comprehension, I\u2019m not going to engage any further with you.", "Idk why so many of these replies seem to actually hope you're going to get fired, or seem to be so excited you might get in trouble for saying what you said.../s \noh wait, I know why..", "I was just saying I get why you did it lol I used to get comments all the time. But ok", ">Skinny people deal with just as much crap and none sense. \n\nThis is not even remotely true. I'm not here to defend fat people, but thinking skinny people deal with as much crap as fat people is asinine and has strong \"all lives matter\" vibes.\n\nSociety as a whole obviously thinks it's more desirable to be skinny than fat.", "I disagree with you on skinny people (by which I mean people who aren't super-skinny) dealing with just as much crap.\n\nNobody in the optimal range of the BMI chart has people in passing cars yelling stuff like, \"Optimal BMI loser! Gain or lose some weight, you average person!!\"\n\nMy assumption that OP in particular didn't have a concern about his weight was partly based on OP literally saying he wasn't sensitive about his weight, but I concede that if I were betting against him having no such issues at all, I would have lost that bet.", "That's really good on you and please don't take my comment as YTA bc it seems like your job can become more toxic and less desirable bc of the incident. It was more of a 'proceed with caution' and hold on to that self value \ud83d\udc4d", "Yes lol. Bc you knew better, you knew it would hurt him and you said it anyway.\n\nI don't think what he said was appropriate either, but I think its worse to knowingly hurt someone rather than accidentally hurt someone.", "Ah so for a factor he cannot control, the one with power should show restraint whereas the weaker is more free to act as he pleases. Doesn't seem fair does it, if action is all we are considering?", "I'm with you and a lot of people hate being super skinny, and it's just their body type.\n\nThat being said ESH, comments on other's bodies have absolutely no place at work. You should have kept your mouth shut and notified HR instead", "I dont think we will agree because I think its personal whether you are offended by the statement as not. I can understand it from both sides. \n\nI am reading into the situation as I see. Your boss called you a skinny bastard admittedly not the best description to use for you, but in the context he's just saying you can still fit into shirts you had from school because your body hasn't grown outwards. Honestly in my eyes could be seen as a compliment.\n\nOn the other hand you literally said they are so fat the shirts on their buttons pop off. There are levels and you went beyond IMO. If you had been offended the better thing to do would've been to actually say that you were. Not further provoke the situation.", "As you mentioned previously, you can always get another job.", "I did read, and you put OPs comment as worse. \n\nAnd from what I understood from your comment, which had a whole explanation on why skinny people have it easier. It was only inappropriate for the boss to make a comment on OPs body, but OP commenting back was worse due to the boss being fat and OP being skinny.\n\nEdit: Apologise if that's not what you meant for calling it disgusting. But the way you structured your comment. It seems like a justification for why you put OP as ahole and only saud the boss's comment was inappropriate.", "Good one lol", "No I agree.", "oh lmao he's somehow made this about race.", "Given Black Lives Matter in my life not all lives you keep barking up the wrong tree.", "No I just get skin and bones, look like boy, do you have ED, on drugs, ect", "Would you say that calling someone an employee a skinny bastard is an accident?", "I disagree with the interpretation, the comment was meant scathingly towards me being a a low BMI individual, of which I still am to a degree.", "I'm sorry an analogy confused you. The point being made wasn't one to do with race, but rather about the need for some people to always perceive themselves as a victim and never being able to admit that maybe someone else was wronged too, perhaps even worse.\n\nThis comment wasn't even directed at you. Due to your response, though, I am certainly making all sorts of assumptions about you now.", "I get you\u2014that's why I made a point to specify that I gathered OP wasn't particularly skinny. I'm very aware that people who are distinctly thin get a lot of crap, too\u2014I would never dispute that.", "I'm saying he didn't inherently intend for the comment to hurt you. You intended for the comment to hurt him, bc you knew it would.", "Make you're assumptions all you want, but you should know I think the analogy was inappropriate to the discussion.", "They are telling you they had issues with it in the past, and they can feel they bulked up, but clearly the \u201cskinny bastard\u201d comment didn\u2019t seem to skip them", "How do you know that, this is a neg, a putdown comment. At least intended to push down if not hurt me in a social setting. Fire with fire.", "OP said he's not sensitive about his weight now. The part that appears to have bothered OP is that basically the boss was roasting him in front of everybody, and it doesn't sound like it was a friendly dynamic. From what I can tell, if the boss had roasted OP's hairstyle or fashion sense it would have been the same because weight is not currently an issue.", "You\u2019re an arrogant idiot that will struggle to hold a job if you insist on being a bull in a China shop to protect fee fees you don\u2019t even have. \n\nThe correct way to handle this would\u2019ve been to speak to him privately and *respectfully* ask that he not comment on your weight because it makes you uncomfortable. \n\nTldr: don\u2019t get in a dick swinging contest with people above you on the food chain. You\u2019ll lose.", "Actually, I think it is very easy to assume he meant this as a positive.  When you are overweight calling someone skinny is usually intented as a big compliment.  Obviously, this is not how you percieved it and that is on him.  But you are viewing this completely from the assumption that he intended to poke fun or insult you and THAT is why you are upset, not becuase the comments hurt your feelings.  And I think you completely wrong in that assumption.   Well you put him in his place.  Hope that makes you feel better because I guarantee that YOUR comments have left a perception with the rest of the people in the room that you are an asshole.  I don't think you realize how your comments looked to everyone else because you are so focused on if you were justified in making them.  You have hurt your professional reputation and the relationship with your boss.", "Are you just skipping the entire part where the boss started this off insulting him about his weight?", "I was insulted and I responded, dick swinging or no it's fair game. People shouldn't use power as a reason to not behave equally.", "'bastard' is no compliment where I am from. Colleagues have congratulated me for standing up for myself. My professional reputation is intact as there has been no incident reports; given my boss made that insult I think he'd be worried if there was."]}
