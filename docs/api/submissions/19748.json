The \u201cjoke\u201d was that you\u2019re skinny and probably fit your old clothes.\n\nYour boss made an amusing observation and you fired back with a huge insult.", "U need to think first.", "I generally agree with you, and if OP's insult results in a change to boss's lifestyle then that's a positive development. In this particular instance, OP indicated the \"skinny\" comment didn't bother them all that much but knew of boss's weight sensitivity. Kind of a dick move for OP to hit that pressure point, but boss opened the door and shouldn't be surprised when someone walks through it.", "first to consider this", "We weren't there, but their comment comes off as an ill-conceived attempt at light conversation. We know OP meant to be malicious, there is no benefit of the doubt to be given.", "Why would you want to work in a place where your boss has a good time shitting on you, but if you shit back at him, you're suddenly the bad guy? Sounds like a toxic workplace.", "It's the \"bastard\" bothering you, not the \"skinny\"?\n\nI'm pretty sure the \"skinny\" was a backhanded compliment and by \"bastard\" he meant \"guy\" or \"bloke,\" though of course it was crude language to use when you don't know how someone will take it.", "You need to grow up. There are more professional and mature ways to handle a rude comment from a colleague or superior. Just bc someone else behaves like an AH doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re given carte blanche to do the same. I understand your boss hit a nerve but you can\u2019t pop off every time someone says something that offends you. You\u2019ll end up losing a lot of jobs.", "You could have just said please don\u2019t call me that and made him still look like an idiot.You are no better than him in this. You stooped to his level and even lower by what you said.", "Tbh you did what most people would like to do. Good on you man, I admire you for sticking up for yourself, you just gave him a taste of his own medicine.", "Maybe managers/bosses that insult their subordinates\u2026", "Nope, he wasn't shaming you!  He was actually indicating that he is envious of your BMI because his is not as good as yours.", "i understand your feelings but body shaming others to give them more opportunities to body shame you more. The viscous cycle will continue and nothing else.", "Do you think your boss would rather be too heavy like he is or be on the low range for BMI like you? I think the latter. I think he envies your being able to eat whatever you want and stay thin.", "That\u2019s not what I said. You brought up your shirt size. You opened the topic of your body. \n\nYou know that\u2019s what I meant.", "I said you were both wrong but it is silly to embarrass your boss just for work reasons. Again, you\u2019re both wrong. Body comments shouldn\u2019t be a part of the work place ever, compliments, roasting none of it.", "You get that skinny shaming and fat shaming aren\u2019t equal? He made a stupid insensitive comment that you should have spoken to him about in private if it bothered you. Instead, you intentionally fat shamed someone you knew was insecure. YTA. \nAnd if you had any sense you wouldn\u2019t be making your boss your enemy.", "I think being someone\u2019s boss and insulting employees below them is more of a power imbalance than a skinny person ragging on a fat person.", "Oh come on. I\u2019m fat and have pretty much always been. It\u2019s absolutely not worse to make fun of someone for being overweight than for being underweight. Sure, being bigger is socially viewed as \u201cworse\u201d, but I\u2019ve had friends who struggled psychologically with being skinny as I did with being fat at least as much as I did. The point being that body shaming is wrong regardless of what direction is moving in and trying to portray skinny people as a more privileged group is not going to help anyone and will only create more antipathy between people.", "Well then don\u2019t dish it if you can\u2019t take it.", "Ah yes, I love being so skinny that i am ashamed of how weak my body looks like. I also love shopping for hours to find my next potato bag I can then strap onto me with a belt to try to make it stand. I also love needing to monitor my meals closely to not end up in hypoglycemia. Frankly being skinny is a dream, and after all, you only get mocked everytime you change in a locker room !", "It isn\u2019t fat discrimination. There are multiple reasons why bring fat isn\u2019t ok. One as an employer your medical insurance will continue to get more expensive because it is a statistical fact that obesity causes more health problems which in turn means more doctor visits driving up the cost of medical insurance for the company. Because of those doctor appointments these individuals are now out of the office more thus losing the company money for time not worked but still getting paid a full salary as if they are working. You are also more prone to injury when you are fat which becomes a liability for the company because if you trip and fall at work and suddenly shatter a bone from the sheer weight of yourself the company can now be sued or have to pay out disability leave. It can\u2019t be discrimination because discrimination is the UNJUST treatment. These are all valid reasons to be wary of overweight individuals", "I'm skinny, at 41! Was once a bigger guy, in my 20/30s but I broke my back in several places. I would be super offended by this and my fat best friend would not be. Irrelevant, shouldn't say it anyway", "It isn't actually different.", "How is it disproportionate? Being teased for size = being teased for size. Neither one of them should have done it, but skinny-shaming is just as bad as fat-shaming. And when is it ever appropriate for a boss to call an employee a bastard?", "If any of my bosses had called me \"skinny little bastard\" in public, I would have downed tools and left. Screw that noise.", "I\u2019m skinny and not big, call me that and you\u2019ll get the same treatment. Are you dumb?", "No idea where you are from, but plenty of places where being called a bastard, is a way bigger disrespect then being called out for something that would be the objective truth.", "> Who was punching down? \n\nFrom the comment you directly replied to:\n\n> Whatever boss's issues are, he punched down\n\nAnd from the post you're commenting on:\n\n> Boss says not true you'll fit in because you're a skinny little bastard.", "indeed. Easier said than done no?", "I don\u2019t think this was defending yourself, this was just retaliation. You can defend yourself without attacking another person", "His comment was inappropriate, but idk that it constitutes a put down. Context matters. Factually, if you have always been thin and still are, then isn\u2019t what he said true? And in some cultures, bastard isn\u2019t considered a slur. And you said you\u2019re not sensitive about your weight, so what really set you off?\n\nWhether he was trying to put you down or just made an inappropriate/offensive joke, I think you overreacted. Especially considering this was your boss. \nThis could\u2019ve been handled much better. Getting in the last word doesn\u2019t always give you the \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f moment that you think it will.\n\nI guess ESH?", "Ok - I can understand that attitude. Based on all your comments, I think this has happened before in this job (which you probably should have mentioned). So, forget all my other comments.\n\nOP, the only person who can make you feel bad about yourself is you. If this job is dragging you down, find something that will make you happy.", "Well, this I understand. If your boss has done this before, maybe it's time to move on. But don't let your insecurities rule you.", "Not understanding the vibe of a room and using your suboordinate as fodder for jokes among an entire group of employees is what I\u2019m seeing in this. I think it\u2019s not fair to give the boss the benefit of the doubt when it clearly was meant as a jab to be heard publicly. Maybe I\u2019m weird but the boss was an AH for using OP as fodder to build rapport", "If someone is sensitive about their weight then they shouldn't be commenting on other peoples weight as it only opens the door saying \"it's ok to make fun of people weight and size\" I agree with OP as a skinny guy I get incredibly upset when others try and mock me for my size so if someone bigger than me says something rude about my weight I meet them with the same energy if they don't like that then maybe they should have kept their mouths shut to begin with. You get as much respect as you give. The only place I see OP may have gone wrong is you should never insult your boss (at least if you plan on staying at that job for a while)", "No problem!", "The statement is aggressive out of jealousy. OP said it wasn't stated in jest, and whether you put \"skinny\" or \"fat\" in front of it, it's just as insulting. \n\nLet's not assume that skinny people cannot be insecure about their weight and that OP is responsible for his boss's feelings when his manager initially overstepped and went on the offensive in the first place.\n\nESH, honestly, because OP did not have to respond in such a manner, but that doesn't absolve the boss of responsibility just because he got offended.", "Interesting how is it even lower, he body shamed me, I body shamed him back. in fact he initiated it does it not balance out?", "That's great that he's envious, who doesn't want that. The joke was in an offensive tone, and calling me a skinny bastard is by no means not an insult.", "He didn't know I wasn't insecure about it; I am on the lower BMI side.", "Ah yes, the boss is morally right because he's the boss and I'm wrong because I'm an employee. War crimes say hello", "Thanks for clearing that up.", "wow interesting fallacy.", "Dude you just clearly like calling people names. So I will say YTA here overall. You came to Reddit to ask a question and when people are responding you are calling them \u201cmercenaries\u201d. Why\u2019d you post at all of you were convinced you were in the right? Standing up for yourself does not involve insulting other people. If you understand self-respect then you understand that you draw boundaries and you politely reinforce them not call people names coz they are crossing your boundary. Btw, you don\u2019t actually tell us that you had already drawn a boundary here but sure, you are standing up for yourself.", "There\u2019s a difference between having self respect and pulling dumb shit that\u2019s going to hurt you in the future. Hopefully the issue is settled without repercussions for you, but it\u2019d probably be smart to figure out how to stand up for yourself without also digging your own grave.", "Try and buy some coffee with self respect, see how far that goes. \n\nThis isn't the above poster telling you to be mercenary about your career. This is the above poster rightly pointing out this is very likely to affect future positions and compensation. Hell if you are in a niche industry too it could be even worse if you get a reputation for being insubordinate.", "People with self respect can just laugh things off, they don't need to resort to \"clapping back\"", "There\u2019s a way to valuing your self-respect without 1. also being an ass, and 2. putting yourself in hot water with your boss.\n\nYou has at least two professional and mature options here: talk to him in private after the meeting to tell him that his comment made you uncomfortable and that you would appreciate him not making other comments of the kind in the future, or go to HR if it\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happens despite you reaching out to him about it. \n\nESH\n\nI read it as him not necessarily insulting you, but more being jokingly envious of you for not gaining weight over the years. Which isn\u2019t appropriate in an office setting with people around when you don\u2019t have that kind of relationship and banter established with him in any case. Maybe, maybe not, but it\u2019s also why talking to him and clarifying would\u2019ve been a much better reaction.", "You know what, that\u2019s fair. The title says \u201ccolleague\u201d and I somehow missed the \u201cboss\u201d part.", "That sounds rough, I\u2019m sorry.", "The fact that your colleagues think it\u2019s funny to make fun of anyone\u2019s body weight should be an indication of who they are and who you are. So much for self respect. You don\u2019t understand respect and neither do they. If you think they respect you any better for making fun of your boss, you are wrong. They are just enjoying the show.", "Yes and no. I think while it\u2019s fair to say we all get carried away sometimes, your comment went beyond that. You really shouldn\u2019t have to actively stop yourself from calling someone fat in a room full of people, especially knowing they feel insecure about it.", "Retaliation then; great!", "It was a put down because it clearly upset OP. Of course that is the standard. You trying to rationalize is pretty gross imo.", "No others have at work, I'm new here and didn't want to establish the same pattern.", "In fairness, i read it the same way.  I took it as friendly roasting especially because of the lack of professionalism.  Mind you, I wasn't there so I didn't hear the tone of his voice or the look on his face to render an actual judgement.\n\nAnd while I know it's naive of me, I tend to default toward optimistic.", "This is the way.", "Is there any degree of cultural mismatch going on in this scenario? Where I'm from, calling someone a skinny bastard would be a joking compliment.", "OK< I'm sorry that I forgot you probably grew up where everyone got a trophy.  It is probably better for you that you've embarrassed your boss in public, since you can't work in a diverse area.\n\nUnless you are in professional sports, being called a skinny bastard would be hard to be considered an insult in a conversation among guys.", "Unfortunately, a lot of bosses are like that.", "To turn it around and act more professional than him in this situation it might be good to just pull him aside and ask that body comments don\u2019t continue at all, both compliments (which I think he thought he was doing, but still inappropriate) and roasting. You can both move on from this smoother", "Somehow I\u2019m getting the feeling you\u2019re an asshole in every area of your life - not just work. Good luck finding a new job.", "I would say valuing monetary/promotion is similar to a mercenary working for money, so perhaps it is less of an insult and more of a comparison no?", "Digging my grave, what is it with this melodrama.", "This hasn't even been reported, but alot of people seem to think my life is already ruined. Strange isn't it.", "I call it standing up for myself really. Believe it or not he hasn't made any comments like that since.", "IMO I valued the attempt at self-respect more than doing/saying nothing. I also showed my colleagues that I can stick up for myself.", "Stand up for yourself is self-respect.", "Well, you should start looking for a new job cause you just committed career suicide at least in that place, I'm not saying you shouldn't stand up for yourself, but you have to be smarter about it", "Maybe it's cultural; but where I'm from calling people a skinny bastard isn't optimistic.", "Good for you but not for me.", "Ah but my profession does involve sports. Tough break there brother.", "True enough. Only good outcomes really. Finally defending yourself feels amazing even if this one was rougher than intended.", "Yes this would be better for certain", "Oh so you'd react the same way, interesting Ad-hominem.", "I do support standing up to bullies, but I also support maintaining professionalism in the work place. I guess you'd know better than people on here whether your boss was a bully who needed to hear this of if you overstepped", "Dude, it\u2019s not prison. You don\u2019t have to get in a fight to prove you can stand up for yourself, you could just have a conversation expressing how you feel and that those kinds of comments aren\u2019t acceptable going forward.", "Because OP's comment was worse. Neither comment was appropriate, but there's a huge difference between a comment about someone being skinny and making a shitty joke about someone being fat. The coworkers' reaction to both make it clear why.", "You didn\u2019t stand up for yourself, you insulted someone who insulted you. Not the same thing as standing up for yourself. Standing up for yourself would have been something like \u201cthat is unacceptable. I do not understand why you need to make any comments about my body. This is a professional setting, and your comments encourage others to comment on each others body.\u201d What you did was what kids do in the kindergarten playground.", "Exactly. Anyone with any experience in the world knows you don't ridicule your boss in front of everyone.  And I don't buy the argument that the OP was just sticking up for himself.  You can do that without tearing someone else down. Unless you're a complete idiot you know very well that you fat shamed him, and you did so deliberately. Don't be surprised when you are shown the door. You will have brought it on yourself.\n\nYTA. And you know it.", "Of course. Not fired yet though :)", "My friends and I shoot worse jabs than that at each other all the time.  The fact that you used the word roast in the title suggested it was meant as joking around.  That's what roasting is.\n\nThe optimistic part is that i would assume based only on your text that that's all it was.", "I was asking whether there was a cultural mismatch within this scenario, i.e. between you and your boss.", "Indeed brother.", "That's where I disagree with the other commenter and also with you.\n\nBoth are inappropriate and neither worser nor better than the other. \n\nBoth were bodyshaming each other, which was completely inappropriate.\n\nThe coworkers reaction doesn't prove or disprove anything( *edit: need more context for forming a proper judgement on why coworkers laughed*).\n\n Similar to your opinion, I can also make similar conclusions in favour of OP. \n\nTwo I can think of are below:\n1. The boss does this all the time, and others were happy someone talked back.\n2. OP never talked like this before, so they were surprised and laughed without thinking.", "The thing is, I think op has never stood up for themselves, and now they think bullying back is how you're supposed to do it when, in reality, they're just damaging their own career", "Oh no, he won't fire you because of this, he can't, but he's gonna do everything he can to make you fail or to push you down so you either quit or fail enough so he can fire you, this is what they do and it's sadly something you need to learn how to avoid or navigate through or else you're gonna suffer a lot", "forgive me, roast is a cultural term too that I am perhaps using incorrectly.", "ok", "All good if there are any problems I can switch job.", "Why should I know that?", "Judging by your comments I'm guessing that's the case.  Look up any comedy central roast.  In any other context those jokes would be suicidaly offensive.", "... and? Is there?", "Ok, that's good, but you won't be able to do it forever. Sadly, we all have a useful life, and there comes a time where we are no longer of horrible age and it's harder to get a job so please for the sake of yourself learn how to actually stand up for yourself and don't be an impulsive idiot"]}
