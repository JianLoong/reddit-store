Because of those doctor appointments these individuals are now out of the office more thus losing the company money for time not worked but still getting paid a full salary as if they are working. You are also more prone to injury when you are fat which becomes a liability for the company because if you trip and fall at work and suddenly shatter a bone from the sheer weight of yourself the company can now be sued or have to pay out disability leave.

Most of the time you can use common sense. Some things are more likely to be sore spots for people, other things are more likely to be received better.\n\nFor example sports. Tease someone about what team they support. That's a safe one. Sports fans are used to taking a ribbing when their side loses. \n\nSomeone's weight however, is not so safe. Surely everyone should know that's a sensitive topic for MANY people. You should know someone a little better before teasing them about their weight.\n\nSo ESH.
