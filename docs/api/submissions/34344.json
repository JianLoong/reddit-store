It would be different if they were children, but Peter is an adult and perfectly capable of understanding why his sister is treated differently than him. And it sounds like he does. \n\nI have no idea why your sister is reacting that way. My best guess is maybe Peter has recently communicated he felt neglected during his childhood, as siblings of disabled children unfortunately often do, and your sister is trying to push the blame onto other people instead of taking accountability for herself.", "NTA, Anna is never going to grow up, she will age but in her mind she will always be a little girl. I think what you are doing is the best thing for Anna. You obviously have her best interest at heart.", "NTA\n\nAs I was reading, I was going to ask what Peter thought about it... and then you answered that.  He's not mad, his mom shouldn't be mad for him.\n\nIn fact, you're quite the opposite of an AH for trying to include your special needs niece and not have her be left out.", "NTA in the slightest. My 44 year old sister has the intellectual age of a toddler and will always require 24 hour care around her and will never be able to earn a wage (unless there's suddenly a need for professional sticker placers to place 100s of stickers on top of each other with high levels of enthusiasm). I know several of my aunts and uncles still buy her Christmas presents, they all stopped buying for me and my brother when we were 18, as my parents did for my cousin's. I think it's wonderful that they still think of her and get her presents and she loves to unwrap them. She will forever be the child of our family and I am happy for her to receive gifts when I don't anymore. I was able to move out, get married, drive, get a job, play sports when I want, read,.... The list is endless to the advantages I have and she doesn't. Extra presents at Christmas is the least she deserves. Good for you for recognising the same for your niece.", "NTA\n\nIs it \"fair\" that Anna will never grow up to be as independent as Peter?\n\nThis isn't about the niece and nephew. This is about your sister using anything she can to put you down. Keep your distance and don't let her petty rivalry get to you. It's her problem.", "NTA your sister needs to get over herself", "Oh for heaven\u2019s sake, your sister is being ridiculous. You\u2019re showing thoughtfulness to your niece in sending a gift for her when grandma gets one, since they live together, and your sister is using this act of kindness to call you out like you\u2019re some horrible human being?  Your sister needs to get a life and a real problem to worry about. If this tiny thing that isn\u2019t even a thing is the only thing she has to whine about, she\u2019s a very lucky person. I\u2019d just shake my head and move on. Let her be angry if it makes her happy. Sounds like a whole lot of projection going on here if you ask me. Maybe she\u2019s feeling a little guilty?  Who knows. This is a her problem. NTA.", "NTA. If you gave Peter gifts when he was a child along with the other kids then you\u2019ve been totally fair. Anna is still a child, that\u2019s the sad and unfair thing. Peter seems to understand, your sister not so much. Ask yourself why she is acting as she is when Peter doesn\u2019t care. Better still ask her! In fact get you, her and Peter together and hash it out. Maybe she feels guilty for Peter being left out because all the attention has been on Anna. Maybe Peter IS upset but just didn\u2019t want to tell you.", "NTA. Peter is an adult and can speak for himself.", "NTA, your sister is being ridiculous.", "NTA and it is very sweet of you to send a gift to Anna.  I agree that she would feel left out if Grandma got a gift and she didn't.  Tell your sister to kick rocks.  She doesn't get to decide who you buy gifts for and who you don't.  Peter not caring is just validation for you.", "NTA, we have a rule in our family, after college if you do not buy them a gift you don't get to expect one back. We make considerations for a couple of special needs family members.", "NTA. One of my daughters has special needs - she is 30. This Christmas we spent with my brother and his young children. Normally I get stockings for all my girls and their spouses if they are with me at Christmas, and they get me a stocking. This year it would have meant getting my brother's 3 stockings and my brother on top of the usual. \n\nStockings have always been the best bit about Christmas for us (my sons in law think it's odd but they also know we are a weird family lol), so I discussed it with my daughters and because of the quantity of stockings needed, we decided to just do them for my brothers youngsters and my 30 year old.\n\nMy other children were not offended by this - next year when they come for Christmas, we will all have stockings again, but this year, logically it was too difficult, but we gave a stocking to 30 because she is mentally a child and loves this part of Christmas,\n\nYour sister is being ridiculous, especially as your nephew isn't upset!!", "Ugh, sounds like your sister needs to chill. You're just trying to include Anna and make her feel special. She's the real child here, so give her a break. Not everyone needs a damn gift at Christmas.", "NTA Peter can work and buy himself what he wants your niece cannot.  That\u2019s the difference.  That\u2019s how I do my grown boys.  1 disabled 1 not.", "NTA. Anna has the mentality of a child, and you very thoughtfully provide her with a gift so she won't feel left out or cheated. Your sister has a very strange way of thinking.", "NTA. You send gifts to your mother and niece, who has the capacity of a child.", "NTA. Good on you for continuing to bring joy to your niece\u2026lol and Peter seems to be just perfectly adjusted. \n\nI\u2019m tired for both you and Peter- your sister sounds exhausting.", "*When I saw Peter on a trip a few months ago I asked him if it bothered him, and he just laughed.* \n\nThere's your answer right there. NTA.", "NTA - all families do it differently.  In my family pretty much all the gift giving goes to the kids.  As adults, we're just pretty much over it.  If we want something, we buy it for ourselves.  Our parents still get us gifts because my mom loves giving gifts, but they don't want gifts from us, just a card.  Siblings don't get gifts.  I get gifts for the niblings and that's about it.  All of my aunts and uncles agreed to stop getting gifts for my generation a few years ago.  We just don't need it.", "I can see I am completely going against the run of play, but I say YTA, as all your niblings are adults. \n\nTo me it seems slightly discriminatory to keep singling your niece out just because she has a disability. I'd taper that off/cut it out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The only one who seems to have a problem here is your sister, and it is ridiculous to expect you to send a gift to Peter out of obligation, especially since he himself has no problem with it. Besides, it sounds to me that a major reason you still send gifts to Anna, other than the fact that it is a nice thing to do, is because she lives with your mother, to whom you are already sending gifts.", "NTA, this is a household thing, in my mind, more than a specific adult child thing. \n\nFor instance, my in-laws have their adult son and his child living with them. He's not related to me or my husband, he's my FIL's stepson. Anyway, I give everyone in that house a gift for Christmas.
