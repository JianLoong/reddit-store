We had a son, and due to circumstances i dont want to get in the weeds on, my baby mother has custody of him. I still see him very often, a few times a week, and I pay child support. I don\u2019t particularly have a good relationship with my sons mother. She resents me for what happens, and honestly I\u2019d rather have that hostility towards me than towards our son, so that\u2019s fine by me. \n\nAfter having my kid, she ended up having another mans baby so she currently has my 8 year old son, and I think a 6(give or take a year) year old girl. I dont really pay the girl any mind as shes not my kid. Admittedly, I am pretty sure her father is not really that involved.\n\nRecently it was my current long term girlfriends birthday and she said that she wanted to take a day trip to Disney for it. I thought it would be a great opportunity to take my son as he\u2019s never been and, it\u2019s Disney and kids love that shit. I told his mother and she seemed displeased. She asked about her daughter and if I would take her.\n\nMy thought was of course not. Like why would I do that? I told her I hadn\u2019t planned on it. She said it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to take him and not take her, as she would get jealous that he got to go to Disney Land and she didn\u2019t. I told her that she\u2019s not my daughter and i don\u2019t really have an obligation to her. I also mentioned that Disney was not cheap and I wouldn\u2019t be spending money on her kid for it. \n\nShe then offered to pay for half her kids trip. I of course rejected this too as if I\u2019m not the kid\u2019s daddy, I\u2019m not gonna pay, after all she has a dad and he should be taking care of her. Also that wouldn\u2019t solve the issue of me having to babysit while on a trip with my son and gf. So I said no to this. She told me then that she wouldn\u2019t be letting her son go simply because it\u2019s not fair.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I may be the asshole. I kinda played my son against her. I told him that I wanted to take him to Disney but his mom said no. This of course led to him being very upset and caused his mom to relent. We went to Disney, had a great time, and she wad incredibly bitter when I brought him back. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671273757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo3qbt/aita_for_not_taking_my_baby_mamas_son_on_a_trip/", "score": 957, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do normally keep them for christmas eve and give them back that night so she can have them for christmas morning since she has another child and my kids are now 15/17 so it's not a big deal to have them christmas morning as it is with a younger child like she has.\n\nDon't let her run your life.

That said, you manipulating the situation was not great. You making his mom look like the bad or mean parent is just wrong. If she is a bad mom, he will figure it out on his own over his life, you don\u2019t need to make it worse. Lastly, it might make sense to sometimes include her daughter in some stuff, whether her father is in her life or not, she\u2019s your son\u2019s sister and you should help honor that relationship.

This applies to children with alienating parents: as long as they are with the AP they are being lied to all the time about us.\n\nYou don't have to bad mouth the alienating parent in order to counteract the lies.  But looking back in our situation, I think it is still vitally important to let the child know that what the AP is saying is not necessarily the truth.
