We had a son, and due to circumstances i dont want to get in the weeds on, my baby mother has custody of him. I still see him very often, a few times a week, and I pay child support. I don\u2019t particularly have a good relationship with my sons mother. She resents me for what happens, and honestly I\u2019d rather have that hostility towards me than towards our son, so that\u2019s fine by me. \n\nAfter having my kid, she ended up having another mans baby so she currently has my 8 year old son, and I think a 6(give or take a year) year old girl. I dont really pay the girl any mind as shes not my kid. Admittedly, I am pretty sure her father is not really that involved.\n\nRecently it was my current long term girlfriends birthday and she said that she wanted to take a day trip to Disney for it. I thought it would be a great opportunity to take my son as he\u2019s never been and, it\u2019s Disney and kids love that shit. I told his mother and she seemed displeased. She asked about her daughter and if I would take her.\n\nMy thought was of course not. Like why would I do that? I told her I hadn\u2019t planned on it. She said it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to take him and not take her, as she would get jealous that he got to go to Disney Land and she didn\u2019t. I told her that she\u2019s not my daughter and i don\u2019t really have an obligation to her. I also mentioned that Disney was not cheap and I wouldn\u2019t be spending money on her kid for it. \n\nShe then offered to pay for half her kids trip. I of course rejected this too as if I\u2019m not the kid\u2019s daddy, I\u2019m not gonna pay, after all she has a dad and he should be taking care of her. Also that wouldn\u2019t solve the issue of me having to babysit while on a trip with my son and gf. So I said no to this. She told me then that she wouldn\u2019t be letting her son go simply because it\u2019s not fair.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I may be the asshole. I kinda played my son against her. I told him that I wanted to take him to Disney but his mom said no. This of course led to him being very upset and caused his mom to relent. We went to Disney, had a great time, and she wad incredibly bitter when I brought him back. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671273757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo3qbt/aita_for_not_taking_my_baby_mamas_son_on_a_trip/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do normally keep them for christmas eve and give them back that night so she can have them for christmas morning since she has another child and my kids are now 15/17 so it's not a big deal to have them christmas morning as it is with a younger child like she has.\n\nDon't let her run your life.

That said, you manipulating the situation was not great. You making his mom look like the bad or mean parent is just wrong. If she is a bad mom, he will figure it out on his own over his life, you don\u2019t need to make it worse. Lastly, it might make sense to sometimes include her daughter in some stuff, whether her father is in her life or not, she\u2019s your son\u2019s sister and you should help honor that relationship.

You said you had a great trip. How is your kid now? Did he stay with you for a couple days? Or did you take him for the day and drop him back at his mom\u2019s?", "And so were you. Playing your son against his mother is a shitty thing to do. Be better and show your son how a man behaves. So far, it looks like you\u2019re both showing him that winning is the only thing that matters and it doesn\u2019t matter who gets hurt in the process. If you want him to grow into a good man, you need to show him how. He deserves better.\n\nYTA in how you used your son. Your ex should not have expected you to take her daughter so NTA for that.", "Oh I agree she was being petty! But you both need to find a way to communicate without using the kids to manipulate the situation. Your ex as well OP! She seems to use your son to get at you in some way. For example.. does your son love spending time with his step sis? If so, while I agree you shouldn't have to pay for her ticket,  maybe your son would've had fun with his sis there too? It would've been a compromise. The kids should come 1st over the feelings you and your ex have for each other.", "do you find you\u2019re not shitty by taking on 0 responsibility of custody, but still wanting a say in the kids life, when you literally care for him 0% of the time", "Totally I just care about the inclusion of the child that wasn\u2019t necessary.

By the men she chose to have kids with that\u2019s not OP fault \n\nIt just becomes a slippery slope when you lay up and have kids with an already impoverished woman, she\u2019ll intern want you to take care of all her kids, if you\u2019re her most will to do BD.", "Exactly, the mom just don't want to explain to her other kid why she can't go to Disney, ofc the other kid would've been angry or sad, but like why should OP kid miss on a Disney trip for no reason besides that the mother just don't want to explain that it just wasn't possible and maybe in the future it would be to her daughter", "So he\u2019s just taking a random kid to Disney world?? Lmaoooo who made you an expert on custody cases?", "Agreed", ">I didn\u2019t want to minimize OP asking about if he was an asshole by highlighting the BM\n\nOkay by doing that you're minimized how AH behavior towards OP lead to AH behavior back minimizing the moms actions. \n\nIf you don't want your kids to hear stuff that'll make them hate you.

He is asking if he\u2019s an asshole for what he did. It is my opinion that he is in fact, and AH for the inclusion of his child.  Not for excluding his son sister he has that right.", "Here\u2019s the thing about parental alienation parents are going to do things that are not always in the best interest of the child. \n\nIt is NOT the job of the other parent to point that out and create a narrative that is negative in the eyes of the child about the other parent. \n\nIt is not either of the parents job to make the child dislike their other parent by pointing out negative attributes, or negative actions. It interferes in undermines the relationship with the other parent. \n\nWhat is the most important is that CHILD has no reliable adults know a safe place when the parental alienation occurs.\n \nThis is only a disservice to the child.
