We had a son, and due to circumstances i dont want to get in the weeds on, my baby mother has custody of him. I still see him very often, a few times a week, and I pay child support. I don\u2019t particularly have a good relationship with my sons mother. She resents me for what happens, and honestly I\u2019d rather have that hostility towards me than towards our son, so that\u2019s fine by me. \n\nAfter having my kid, she ended up having another mans baby so she currently has my 8 year old son, and I think a 6(give or take a year) year old girl. I dont really pay the girl any mind as shes not my kid. Admittedly, I am pretty sure her father is not really that involved.\n\nRecently it was my current long term girlfriends birthday and she said that she wanted to take a day trip to Disney for it. I thought it would be a great opportunity to take my son as he\u2019s never been and, it\u2019s Disney and kids love that shit. I told his mother and she seemed displeased. She asked about her daughter and if I would take her.\n\nMy thought was of course not. Like why would I do that? I told her I hadn\u2019t planned on it. She said it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to take him and not take her, as she would get jealous that he got to go to Disney Land and she didn\u2019t. I told her that she\u2019s not my daughter and i don\u2019t really have an obligation to her. I also mentioned that Disney was not cheap and I wouldn\u2019t be spending money on her kid for it. \n\nShe then offered to pay for half her kids trip. I of course rejected this too as if I\u2019m not the kid\u2019s daddy, I\u2019m not gonna pay, after all she has a dad and he should be taking care of her. Also that wouldn\u2019t solve the issue of me having to babysit while on a trip with my son and gf. So I said no to this. She told me then that she wouldn\u2019t be letting her son go simply because it\u2019s not fair.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I may be the asshole. I kinda played my son against her. I told him that I wanted to take him to Disney but his mom said no. This of course led to him being very upset and caused his mom to relent. We went to Disney, had a great time, and she wad incredibly bitter when I brought him back. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671273757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo3qbt/aita_for_not_taking_my_baby_mamas_son_on_a_trip/", "score": 5137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do normally keep them for christmas eve and give them back that night so she can have them for christmas morning since she has another child and my kids are now 15/17 so it's not a big deal to have them christmas morning as it is with a younger child like she has.\n\nDon't let her run your life.

That said, you manipulating the situation was not great. You making his mom look like the bad or mean parent is just wrong. If she is a bad mom, he will figure it out on his own over his life, you don\u2019t need to make it worse. Lastly, it might make sense to sometimes include her daughter in some stuff, whether her father is in her life or not, she\u2019s your son\u2019s sister and you should help honor that relationship.

What about if the son wants to go on a school trip but the mum says no because she can't afford to send her daughter on one? Maybe she'll ask OP to split any savings he made for his son to go to uni because she can't afford to pay for her daughter.\n\nIt's on the mother to try and get child support out of her other baby daddy or step up and find a way to provide enough for both parents for her daughter.

(It's made worse because my mother is a narcissist and an addict, my dad was an alcoholic but the better and more stable parent.) I always told them both I would choose them because I didn't want to hurt them or disappoint them. Or worse, and they'd stop loving me. By the time I was 9, I was terrified of turning 12 and started having thoughts of unaliving myself.

The dad paid for my friend's very expensive private school education, but her mother told her he only did that because it was part of their divorce and co-parenting agreement.\n\nShe later found out literally none of that was true. Her father is actually awesome and made sure her brothers never forgot who she was through photos and telling them stories about her, in the hope that she'd reach out when she became an adult. He fought for a long time to be able to see her, but was rarely able to make that happen. It was heartbreaking for him that, on those rare occasions, she clearly hated him because of all the crazy BS her mother had told her, over the years.\n\nThankfully, these days, she's cut contact with her mother and has a great relationship with her dad and brothers. But they'll never be able to get back the years her mother stole from them.\n\nI don't think I'll ever understand how a person can do that parental alienation shit and still think they're the good guy.

Their mother was loudly telling anybody who would listen that she made a mistake having children.  That she should never have children.  That if she could live her life over again, she would get fixed so that it was impossible for her to have children.  I caught her cheating on me.  I hired the best divorce lawyer in the state.  My legal fees were tens of thousands of dollars.  I naturally assumed that I would get full custody.  Not only did she not want the kids, but she had abandoned us for over a year.  And that had nothing to do with the cheating.  \n\nI sued for 100% custody.  On our side, we had irrefutable evidence that she didn't want the kids, and had abandoned them.  Guess who got 100% custody?  It wasn't such a shock, though.  My expensive lawyer warned me that (most likely) that was going to happen.  See, HER lawyer advised her to seek custody so she could collect child support, as her lawyer knew the support order would be big buck$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nSo when I filed for divorce, she wisely lied to the court about having a \"change of heart\" and suddenly loving her children.

I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not her first choice. Also, you should know about your son\u2019s sister. It\u2019s not in his best interest for you to not even know basic facts about her. Also, you didn\u2019t get a chick pregnant; she\u2019s a woman. You should never play your son against his mom. You certainly don\u2019t have to take her child to Disney and if you have a custody agreement, you can just do that outing on your day. It was wrong for her to expect you to do that, especially if she isn\u2019t offering to fully pay for her daughter. Your son shouldn\u2019t be deprived of experiences just because he has a half sibling, but you should also think about their family dynamic and how your choices impact that, because it will end up affecting your son. A jealous, competitive, hostile sibling relationship is not a happy thing to grow up in. Again, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to take her to Disney, but you could definitely afford to offer more sympathy and kindness towards her.

In this case, I don't think there's any argument that taking a kid to disney would be harmful for them.\n\nSo, at the most basic level, your depriving a kid of something beneficial to them and their development.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of kids who grow up too poor to afford a soccer ball, and yet somehow they can still suffer from not having one. Disney is no different, its just a much bigger/greater  experience, and that's just a further argument to not deprive a kid of it when they have the opportunity.\n\nThere are plenty of children who suffer because they don't get to experience the things they desire to. A boy in the city may suffer because they haven't had the chance to go on a hunting trip they so desire, or perhaps another child may suffer because they wish to see an amusement park like Disney. I don't know how you can honestly say that you don't suffer from missing out on experiences that you could have had.", "Uh, how do you know if he's made \"necessary\" changes or not?

If you had agreed to this you bet my ass that every trip and holiday you plan for you and your son baby mama would EXPECT and DEMAND that you take her little girl too! Prepare youself for the future. If you buy a gift for your son you have to buy something for his sister too. If your son comes to visit you for a couple of days his sister will come too.

It would have been kind to bring the sister, but you didn't have to and had every right to say no. Refusing you a visitation day because you wouldn't take his sister is the kind of thing is wind up back in court over.\n\nDragging the kid into it was petty and wrong. At best you were venting to him about how angry you are at his mom, you were probably even worse by manipulating him into pressuring his mom.", "There is another factor: Not being her father, you would not be able to sign for any emergency care for her, like if there was an accident or other that required medical release forms signed.
