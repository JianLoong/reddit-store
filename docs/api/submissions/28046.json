{"id": 28046, "submission_id": "16xip0c", "title": "AITA for telling my brother that he\u2019s stupid?", "selftext": "This is absolutely ridiculous but here we are. My (27f) brother Matt (30m) has 1 child (7m), my wonderful nephew Sam with his ex girlfriend Jane (27f). Jane and I were friends at the end of high school and eventually she and Matt met about a year after graduation at a party I threw when Matt was home from university, which they both attended, had a one night stand which is when she got pregnant. They tried to make it work several times over a couple of years but called it quits permanently 4 years ago. I stayed friends with Jane because I\u2019ve known her for ages and honestly she\u2019s just pretty rad. Matt wasn\u2019t thrilled about it, but since there was no infidelity or anything he eventually got used to it. \n\nWe live in the UK, and they came to a private child maintenance agreement which the court signed off on. At the time, neither of them made much money but she made slightly more so Matt\u2019s child maintenance payments were very minimal for a couple of years because he only made \u00a324k and jane made 26k or something around that. Now they both have better paying jobs, Matt has the same job I do and makes 48k and idk how much Jane makes, but she\u2019s told me in the past she makes 40k. The thing is that she never asked the court to increase child maintenance payments, and so Matt is still paying the same as he was before (it\u2019s about \u00a3250/m I think). She never chases him for paying late, never has. But she has obviously started providing higher quality things for Sam, and recently she booked a 2 week trip to Cancun to celebrate her parents 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nMatt did not take it well at all. He\u2019s convinced himself that Jane has used his child support to pay for the trip. He wants to report her to the court for misuse of funds or something This obviously isn\u2019t true, and she\u2019s been telling us since the start of the year she\u2019s been saving for it since her parents decided to go on the luxury end of things. When he told me that, I told him he was being stupid, and that his pitiful \u00a3250 a month wouldn\u2019t put a dent in how much she\u2019d have to pay for the trip. And if he does do that his support payments will go up a lot, as they should. He called our parents who are now mad at me, and has forbidden me from taking Sam on a museum trip we\u2019ve been looking forward to and planning for months. I told him it\u2019s unfair to punish Sam for being mad at me, and he\u2019s way overreacting.

If I called him bloody stupid, too, it wouldn't make me TA either.", "NTA, his payment should have doubled, or close.", "NTA\n\nMatt is being dumb and is jealous that he can't go on the trip with the kid. He also probably hasn't set himself up in a financial position to where he could do that for kids, and so the jealousy compounds. \n\nNot the asshole for calling him stupid. The truth hurts. If he was fully supporting a dead-beat baby mamma... Okay, fair is fair. BUT, it's not like he is fully funding his ex's lifestyle and the kids. You are 100% correct that 250 a month ain't what's paying for the trip. If he was paying 2500 a month, or1500, maybe even 1000... alright we have an argument. But, nah...

Because it\u2019s unfair that he doesn\u2019t get to go to see the exhibits he\u2019s been really excited about and I don\u2019t get to see my nephew just because Matt is mad and won\u2019t allow it on his only weekend.", "My parents aren\u2019t forbidding me, though they are mad at me.

If you can't take photos maybe take copious notes and then make a long audio recording talking about a particular exhibit to send to Jane.", "Ugh, Matt is behaving obtusely. Honestly, you should keep the girlfriend - do a Taylor Swift and Sophie Turner if you're like me - a petty little drama gremlin. \n\nHonestly, I hope you stay in Sam's life. It sounds like the rest of his father's family are immature, calloused potatoes. He needs his cool aunt.", "so you just proved my point even more?\n\nSince the brother now makes almost double what he used to, the childs standard of living by that logic should double and so should payments in theory?", "Yes, but from the wording of your last comment is sounds like you think he is already paying the half he should.", "I can see how it could read that way i suppose\n\n&#x200B;\n\n'half he should be' :D", "He can't forbid you to take Sam anywhere unless he actually has custody of him. He's just throwing his weight around with nothing to back it. Ignore him, he is being stupid (as you know). NTA", "nta. child support is for the parent to use for the child. soits the parents money not the childs'. if the child is getting what they need and are getting the luxuries, then no court will rule against her on misuse of child support. as for the museum trip, short of a restraining order, there is nothing your parents or your brother can do legally if you have the consent of jane", "NTA. Haha, you're parents are forbidding you, a 27yo adult, from taking your nephew to the museum.\n\nI'm sure you can tell them where to go", "Nta\nBoy math: baby mama is using pennies that i pay in child support to fund her trips", "I don't think OP will get an apology. Brother will blame OP for 'encouraging Jane to steal more of his money ' or some other excuse like that."]}
