She was a single mom and my only other family was my aunt Marisa. Marisa refused to take me in or even help me at all because \u201cYou\u2019re grown. You can stand on your own two feet.\u201d Marisa\u2019s boyfriend was nice and would help, but Marisa eventually banned him from even giving me dinner leftovers because I needed to \u201cgrow up instead of expecting hand-outs.\u201d Luckily, my employer at the time helped me get some affordable housing. I struggled for a long time, but I luckily don\u2019t have to live paycheck to paycheck anymore.\n\nMarisa\u2019s family is currently struggling, and she reached out to me through a mutual acquaintance. Marisa\u2019s boyfriend recently lost his job for a reason that I\u2019m not entirely sure about. Marisa stayed home and only did occasional work like baking for friends\u2019 parties, so they\u2019re seriously struggling right now. Marisa asked for just a bit of money or some unused food from my pantry to help keep them afloat.\n\nI called Marisa back and told her \u201cHey, why are you asking for hand-outs? You\u2019re grown. You can stand on your own two feet.\u201d Marisa was angry, but I was just as pissed back. Because she\u2019s the one who left me to fend for myself when I was a vulnerable 18-year-old who was barely out of high school and just lost my mom. And now she wants help? I texted some information for a local food bank and some other resources to Marisa\u2019s boyfriend, just for him and my cousins. But I didn\u2019t even respond back to Marisa after the first phone call.\n\nMost people agreed with how I reacted to Marisa, but multiple are telling me I was wrong and I\u2019m punishing the wrong people. Because I know from experience that getting access to those resources can be a lot harder/take a long time and Marisa\u2019s boyfriend and my cousin may need help immediately. These people also told me that by being the bigger person and helping Marisa in her time of need, I can show Marisa how wrong she was and what a huge mistake she made. I don\u2019t see it that way at all. I feel bad for Marisa\u2019s boyfriend and my cousins, but if I helped them, it would be rewarding Marisa for refusing to help me during my own hard times.

How she could do that AND sleep at night is beyond me.\n\nYou at least gave her the names and contact info for organizations that can help her - that is more than she did for you.\n\nLots of people say things like \"You should be the bigger person.\"  Personally, I don't agree.  Maybe I am hard-hearted.  I believe if you are good to me, then I will reciprocate, in fact I will go above and beyond to ensure you have what you need.  If another person is crappy to me, then NOPE.  I am a stone wall.  This is not popular in my family.

She will always be like this until she feels the heartache and stress of being poor. Trust me, I grew up on \"hand outs\".
