She\\`s indeed the grown woman, can stand on her own two feet - and does not need handouts.\n\nSeriously - do not give in to her UNLESS at the very least, she acknowledges she did you wrong, and apologized without reserve to you for her treating you like crap - for kicking you when you were down.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Honestly, feel like you aren\u2019t wrong with the way she treated you, plus it\u2019s not like you aren\u2019t helping her, you did give them some info on where they should go for help like how she did to you.

I'm betting she still thinks she did the right thing and doesn't feel any remorse for her treatment of you, which is why I think you're justified in employing the same strategy she used on you. I'm petty so I probably would have told her I ouldn't help because she had taught me the importance of never relying on family to help because as soon as uou're 18, you're a full grown adult who needs to stand on your own 100% of the time, and you hope she's proud of you for learning that lesson so well.", "NTA.
