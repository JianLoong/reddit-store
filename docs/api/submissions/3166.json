To me Marissa seems like a no give take all person and helping her wouldn\u2019t change anything. If she were realising her past mistakes the least she would so is apologise for how she treated OP earlier in life but she\u2019s purely asking for help. Here I think it\u2019s retaliation that will teach her something.", "Literally the same lesson learned that they think helping her would teach", "This made me cackle, it's such a perfect response for all those 'holier-than-thou' people judging OP", "This.", "Probably because we are on the internet, and this family's financial situation at the time of refusal is not remotely explained for us to comment on. After all, the aunt is hungry now, so maybe you and I could have also understood the aunt's past refusal to help so she could save for a rainy day.\n\nThe worst thing the aunt did was her flippant, rude comment. That's not something to break up over if it's a one-time thing. You say \"wow, you shouldn't have said that. I didn't like that.\" And you make sure they don't consistently act in a way that's so unpleasant. That is all.", "Whoops, fixed that, thanks.", "I was thinking all - but rubbing it in to Marissa.  \nOr go another petty route \"i know you do not believe in handouts, and therefore you\\`ll be doing the dishes/cleaning the kitchen afterward\"", "She owes the boyfriend nothing. He tried to help but ultimately went along with the aunt.", "Not all people can spare food or money to help others. The aunt contributed to a combined household, so the boyfriend wasn't solely responsible for financial issues at the time. I am not gonna give asshole status for that based on internet info. I can see how a decent human being might not be able to assist.\n\nHOWEVER, the aunt was flippant to OP about OP's struggles even when the ability to share food was at least debatable. That's truly indecent.", "Exactly. Those \u201clearn to stand on your own two feet\u201d comments were WAY over the line. Who says that to anyone who just lost a close family member? Much less a close relative? Who begrudges a close relative who just lost a close family member LEFTOVERS FROM DINNER. Honestly, if I couldn\u2019t afford THAT I would just cook a cheaper dinner so I could feed one extra person a few times a week. And if you really, really couldn\u2019t even afford that but had a loving heart, wouldn\u2019t you say, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss,and I wish could do more to help you, but I\u2019ll do whatever I can\u201d?\n\nMy father grew up pretty poor, but his mother was quite generous with people who were even worse off than her. He said his family\u2019s attitude was: We may not have much, but we can still do SOMETHING to help other people.\n\nIt\u2019s the aunt\u2019s heartless attitude that OP resents, moreso than the aunt withholding some specific amount or type of assistance."]}
