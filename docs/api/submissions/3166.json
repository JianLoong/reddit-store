Youre never required to swallow anger or betray yourself in order to SEEM like you\u2019re being nice. Listen to your heart it is there to be believed. You\u2019re making a healthy relational boundary about what you expect from people if they are going to be graced with your effort time and consideration: and you are entirely deserving of making those boundaries whatever the f&@# you want.", "NTA \n\nTake your cousins in if you can. Let your aunt and her boyfriend stand on their own 2 feet.", "NTA. There are food banks and lots more governmental help for families that they have access to. Those kids qualify them for food stamps, section 8 housing, medical care and other benefits. They will survive if he even just applies for unemployment.\n\nThis is a classic case of don't burn bridges you may need to cross later. Auntie is SOL and isn't entitled to your money.", "Well I would have informed her - that was your advice when my Mom died. You wouldn\u2019t even offer me leftovers. Why do you think I owe you anything.\u201d", "NTA.\n\nMarisa is just reaping the consequences of her actions.\n\nYou don't owe her anything. She is a grown woman who can stand on her own and it sounds like she's getting side-lessons in humility and self-awareness.", "Not the boyfriend, because when it was the time to choose between helping someone in need or appeasing his awful partner, we know what he chose.", "Seriously. Also, if they need something immediately they can see if there is a Little Pantry nearby. They're like those little free libraries but for food that won't spoil, can go to it immediately at any time of day. Our local ones are posted outside of churches/ community centers and work great for emergencies and those who can't hold much at once due to homelessness.", "Yes, indeed. If they are so concerned, they can help.", "Marisa has never genuinely apologized. She always insists that her refusal to help was justified because I legally was an adult and could \"stand on your own two feet.\" \n\nI'll think about possibly inviting only Marisa's boyfriend and my cousins for dinner, but I'm not sure if Marisa would try to come in uninvited or pull an \"If I'm not there, my kids/boyfriend can't come either.\"", "I didn\u2019t know those existed! That\u2019s incredible!", "He's an established adult with connections that already knows how to play the game of life. She was a freshly orphaned teenager who had none of that. \u2260 \n\nthe aunt and her pushover lapdog made their bed, now they have to lie in it", "NTA, Then those people can help her", "Your mother would be proud of the woman you have become. If you want to float him help like he did for you, contact the boyfriend separately. But, auntie can kick rocks.\n\nNTA", "NTA she would never forgive you that you helped her. \n\nShy would be nice as long she as she needs but later she would make you regret", "NTA\n\n If aunt is unwilling to give scraps to a freshly orphaned kid, she deserves even less for herself. I think you handled this exactly right. She has other options, she can utilize those and leave you alone.\n\n I'm so sorry for your awful shove into adulthood, but congrats on keepin' on!", "I am sorry but even the BF is (slightly) AH. How can he let a poor 18yo who just lost her mom without support ? Has he no heart ? Even if his GF banned him to do, has he no spine?\n\nThey don\u2019t deserve you. You did well, please distance yourself from them.", "NTA.\n\nI would've phrased it more like this:\n\n\"I was 18 years old and had just lost my mother when you said to me what I'm about to say to you. [Say the phrase here]. Here are some resources you can tap into and good luck but I want nothing further to do with you.\"\n\nThen really go NC with her.", "NTA - As an adult she should have known how hard that was. She chose to let you just flounder and drift and just figure it out yourself. I can\u2019t imagine how scared you were. That\u2019s a seriously steep learning curve and she didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what happened to you. Wonder how she\u2019d feel now if her 18 yr old child lost her and were told by you to just figure it out?? Bet she\u2019d be appalled and angry.       \nShe\u2019s been an adult much longer than you and is perfectly capable to find out where to get assistance. She just wants the easy way of family handouts and doesn\u2019t want to go searching and applying for it. Guess Marissa needs to find a job too.", "NTA. You were thrown out into the wild after your mother\u2019s death and she offered nothing. She also could have been working the entire time, but chose not to. When my ex-husband and I divorced, I took whatever job was available to pay for what my family needed. Resources take time to get, but not so much that they cannot make do with what is readily available.", "ESH. Your aunt was an asshole to you when you were 18. You are being an asshole to her in return now. All's fair and payback is a bitch. I would likely do the same. But, you are retaliating to her asshole behaviour with your own asshole behaviour. That's why everyone sucks here. Not saying what you are doing is wrong, considering what happened in the past, just saying it ain't right either.", "NAH. You did send information about food pantries. If you feel bad, send a donation to the pantry.", "Nta. However, I think the best revenge would be to drop off food with a letter personally thanking the boyfriend for helping you when times were tough, and how you want to return the favour. Just to really rub her nose in it.", "NTA. F them.", "\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udfc5", "You\u2019re very kind. But remember this was her sister\u2019s daughter who she literally gave her the verbal middle finger when it mattered in her life most. She lost her mom and had no clue how to be an adult and this woman just didn\u2019t care at all. I can take the higher ground a little but I wouldn\u2019t here. I do get what you\u2019re saying but Marissa stopped so low to hurt OP I couldn\u2019t give her a pass. It\u2019s not like there isn\u2019t help available. There are plenty of food pantries and churches who have food available.", "You won't see anything you give her again. Don't let her cash in on your hard work improving your life. Just don't.", "Don't. It's just picking a fight.", "Aunt is not really without resources; she has a phone and a roof over her head. She really can get a job. It might not pay well, but it will pay more than begging!", "http://mapping.littlefreepantry.org/", "Wow, now he is lapdog, you must have such a kind heart and personality with such mouth...", "Fuck around, find out Marisa.", "Yeah NTA. Also can go to a food pantry and come home that day with plenty of groceries. I\u2019ve had to do it myself before during hard times. So I know they can do that.  Took about an hour. Auntie can do what she said to you and get online and start applying. All the stores and restaurants need employees", ">These people also told me that by being the bigger person and helping Marisa in her time of need, I can show Marisa how wrong she was and what a huge mistake she made. \n\nLOLOL.... no\n\n>but if I helped them, it would be rewarding Marisa for refusing to help me during my own hard times.\n\nYup, this! 100%! Marisa can eff off! Even if OP did choose to help, Marisa would not thank them for it", "NTA.  This is textbook karma.  Reaping what you sow.  What goes around comes around.  Phrase it however you like.", "You gave the same energy back that she gave. She has no one to be angry at but herself for not helping you first. NTA", "Nta", "Nta! Did she ever apologize or acknowledge how she hurt you? Sorry no she should have gotten a job if they were relying on his income so desperately.\nIt makes it tricky cuz there are kids involved it you have zero obligations to her", "Yeah, I come from the north shore of Chicago - home of old-money petty people. I'd offer them help, and make sure to bring it up when the topic comes up at the next dinner\n\n\"Oh, I heard Marissa and her family were having a tough time. You know, I can't stand by and see that, it's the least I can do to give them some help with food and expenses while she's out of work. You know how hard this has to be for her...\", rub it in real good.", "Girl NTA NTA NTA \n\nMmmmmhmmmmm that\u2019s some tasty karma pie slapping ole Marisa in the pie hole. \n\ndelicious \ud83e\udd0c", "NTA. Let her reap what she's sown with her own toxicity", "As I said, she isn't morally obligated to help at all, for the reasons you state -- I agree. She might decide to take the high road for her cousins, because it's sad when innocent kids suffer just because their parents suck! But even if she does, her aunt's failure to help her should never be forgotten. Her aunt should never be let off the hook for what she did.", "That\u2019s so cool! Thank you for sharing!"]}
