I (20f) live with 3 other roommates (all 20-25f). I\u2019ve lived with roommates before, so I\u2019m no stranger to awful roommates, but I feel like I\u2019m not justified in my anger, but I\u2019ll get to that in a moment. \n\nAnyways, I live with 3 other roommates, all women. One of my roommates has been causing problems since I moved in (about 4 months ago) and even before I arrived. It\u2019s mostly been general untidiness, but she\u2019s started to leave dishes out/food unwashed that\u2019s started to attract bugs into our kitchen. Again, I\u2019ve dealt with shitty roommates, but I guess I want to know I\u2019m rightfully angry/figure out what to do?\n\nAside from the general gross-ness, she has a boyfriend that will not stop parking his car in our (2 car) driveway. I have another roommate that has a car, and then myself, so there\u2019s only room for two cars in the driveway. She\u2019s been out of town for the last week or so, and she does so for work purposes every once and awhile, and every time, the boyfriend parks in the driveway. Either parks farther in, so when I come home, he\u2019s behind me, or he\u2019s blocking me in and I can\u2019t leave if I want/need to. They normally go out late at night, when I\u2019m asleep because I start work early in the mornings. Tonight I hit a breaking point, because I was woken up when they had to leave. I\u2019ve told her multiple times now that he should park on the street (there is street parking available!). She spammed my phone as well as the roommate who is out of town asking to move the car and the other roommate actually ended up calling me to wake me up. Now I\u2019m awake, and annoyed, and while I was on the phone other roommate told me I should just keep dealing with it and avoid the headache. I understand where she\u2019s coming from but at the same time, I talked to my other friend and she said I should not respond at all next time and just sleep and ignore her. \n\nI guess my question is what do I do? A part of me wants to keep the peace within the house and just deal with it, but I did send her a very long text earlier telling her that again, he should park on the street and I will not be responding next time, because I know there will be a next time. But do I keep the peace? I know I\u2019m only here for another few months, so is it even worth it? Or should I put my foot down because she definitely won\u2019t change. \n\nSorry for the long post. I just need to be told I\u2019m not overreacting lol. Thanks:)\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been having this issue for a while and roommate with the other car keeps telling me to just keep the peace and it makes me feel like I\u2019m overreacting. I also know I\u2019m tired and might\u2019ve just been really annoyed at being woken up but please tell me I\u2019m NTA lol", "created_utc": 1701233340, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186h81h/aita_for_refusing_to_move_my_car_so_my_roommates/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may have an obligation to your roommates to move your car if it\u2019s blocking them in, but you have no obligations to him. He\u2019s being extremely rude.

So while roommate 2 is out of town he thinks there\u2019s an extra spot and will park there? If that\u2019s right, I think a firm but respectable middle ground is appropriate here. He should not be inconveniencing paying tenants of the household who need to get to work and go about their day. If he/she is unable to respond in a reasonable time to move the car so that you don\u2019t get inconvenienced, that\u2019s not acceptable. You are NTA for bringing this up with them. I think you should essentially be firm and say you don\u2019t mind him parking there as long as it\u2019s not making you late or blocking you in. But it is, so it\u2019s becoming a problem. He needs to be more considerate of that and either you guys leave your keys in a communal spot and give permission to move them if needed, or if they are coming back late and know you have work in the morning, to park on the street. Something needs to shift, so sit them down and say this is a problem but that you want to talk and see if you can all agree on a system. More than reasonable. THEN if they still ignore your agreement, you have every right to kick off and contact the landlord to tow the car lol.", "Leave a note on his car explaining the house rules and consequences.\n\nHe is no different than if a neighbor parked in the driveway.
