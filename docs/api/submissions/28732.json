To expect two gifts is overreaching.  Your contribution is the cake for the wedding and that's enough.  For them to expect  a second gift of additional money for their honeymoon is really rude in my opinion.", "I was so grateful for my husband's friend gifting us our wedding cake.

So you don't need to contribute anything, but you should understand why your husband wants to. He would feel as if he has given no gift otherwise.\n\nIf you have separate finances, explain it to him, and tell him he can give a gift from his own money if he wishes. If you have shared budget... I'd say negotiate with him, so he could still make a gift, if you can afford it.", "NAH\n\nHow much will it cost you to make the cake? The retail price at your work would include profit.  How much would you gift your BF if the cake weren\u2019t a factor? Since your husband thinks you should give a gift as well, it seems like that would be in your budget.
