She later said it was because myself, her, and her still BFF (let\u2019s call her Chloe) were a trio back in high school so it felt weird not asking me. \n\nWe went dress shopping with all 5 bridesmaids/MOH, her mom, grandma, and FMIL. It was a nice time, we all had brunch and then she tried on dresses. Her fianc\u00e9 is Catholic and she wanted a traditional style dress. The one she picked was white with silver embroidery in a pattern that I thought looked familiar but couldn\u2019t place it at the time.\n\nA week later and I post a picture of my toddler on my bed. She was laying in a way that made it look like the design was surrounding her perfectly, it looked like it was on purpose and I used my nice camera too, it\u2019s a really nice picture. Chloe commented, first saying \u201cawwww\u201d but then said \u201cwait, is that Amber\u2019s dress?\u201d I replied that it was my bedding. She then made a group chat with me and Amber and said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you say anything to Amber when she bought a dress that has the same design and colors as your bedding?\u201d I said I didn\u2019t realize that it was the same. Amber said \u201cit\u2019s weird that you bought bedding that matches my dress.\u201d And I told her that I\u2019ve had this bedding for 3 years now. They both demanded that I take the picture of my child off social media and I said no so they blocked me and another bridesmaid said that they told her to uninvite me. \n\nI had put the deposit for the bachelorette party (we split it 5 ways and my 1/5 was the deposit, no one else had put money down yet. It\u2019s at a resort at a casino and my family frequents so I got us a good deal on a very nice suite\u2026) and since I\u2019m uninvited I cancelled the reservation so I could get my money back. Now everyone is saying that I\u2019m an AH and that I took it too far by canceling the bachelorette.", "created_utc": 1681765688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pwvnk/aita_for_not_telling_a_friend_that_her_wedding/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hey, if she wants a hideous sounding dress that looks like well, to be honest, hideous sounding bedding (no offence, but def not my style.....) then that is her problem.
