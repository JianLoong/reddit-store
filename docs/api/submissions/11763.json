My wife passed away 4 years ago after losing her battle with cancer.  I have recently been offered a promotion at work that would require a move to a different state halfway across the country.  It's a huge opportunity career-wise and after discussing it with my kids, I decided to accept it.  We are moving in 2 months.  \n\nThe problem is my wife's parents.  We moved to our current home because it's closer to them.  We are still a 4-hour drive from them, but it's closer than the 16-hour drive we previously lived at before we had kids.  My wife was always very close with her parents and even though they are far from my favorite people, they were very involved in our lives and our kids' lives.  \n\nAfter our oldest was born, my wife would invite her parents over for extended visits (2-3 weeks at a time) a few times a year.  This continued up until her death.  After she died, I did not make the effort to continue this.  I just didn't have the emotional or mental energy to have them in our house for that long.  We still spent long weekends with them on holidays, but that was pretty much it.  \n\nWhen I told them that we are moving, they were both very upset.  MIL especially so.  She said that she knew that I've been phasing them out of their grandkid's lives and this proves to her that I don't want anything to do with them.  I tried to explain that this is an opportunity too good to pass up and that my kids agree with the decision and are excited to move to a new place.\n\nI tried to assure her that we would still make an effort to see them on holidays and invite them out to visit us once we get ourselves settled, but she claimed that those were all empty promises.  She said that my wife would never have agreed to something like this and that I'm tarnishing her memory.  At that point, I snapped.  I told her that she has no right to tell me what my wife would have wanted and that unless the next words out of her mouth are supportive and kind, then I'm blocking her.  She decided to hang up on me.  \n\nA few minutes later, FIL called me and tried to apologize for his wife because this is all such a huge and sudden change and they are trying to wrap their heads around it.  I told him I'm willing to let them see the kids before we leave, but I need a direct apology from his wife and if either of them say anything negative about my decision, the visit will end immediately and I'll block them both.  He told me I'm being a little to harsh and I need to give MIL a break because she fears she will never see her grandkids again.\n\nI haven't heard anything back from them since and I'm not going to make the effort to reach out to them.  I understand this decision hurts them and puts added distance between them and their only grandkids.  But this is a decision I'm making in the best interest of my family and I'm not going to change my mind.", "created_utc": 1678218260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l944f/aita_for_moving_away_from_my_inlaws_with_my_kids/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Best of luck!", "Your MIL's fears aren't unfounded based on recent precedent, but she also needs to respect the fact that your family is a unit with a life of its own that doesn't stop because she wants things to be different.  You've sorted things with your children. You can sort things out with their maternal grandparents.  They need to learn to respect your decisions as the adult caring for their grandchildren.

I\u2019m sorry about your wife, you sound like a good man.", "NTA. You and your children cannot put your lives on permanent hold to please your MIL. There are so many ways to connect and stay in touch. I understand the children are her link to her daughter, but she was wrong to accuse you of phasing them out and trying to use your wife's memory as a manipulation tactic.", "Nothing more than my story. No judgment. \n\nMy first husband killed himself. I wanted nothing more than to grab my children and run, to not have to listen to the family I disliked but had been forced to deal with when he was alive. My environment was torture without him there. I regularly felt like I couldn't breathe. I dreamed that he would come back and take me to whatever depths of hell his tortured psyche had led him to. You see, I found him in the bedroom.\n\nA couple of years later I did choose to move to somewhere I considered better - not halfway across the country, but far enough. My own father pointed out to me that despite my dislike of some of my in laws, I needed to 1) differentiate between my personal animosity and my children's needs, and 2) not allow my own grief to allow me to discount theirs and color my actions.\n\nI realized after a while that the grief of his parents and of myself had become a contest. It had coalesced. It was a monster grown larger than we were that oddly enough fed off of us all, and if one of us didn't start to release it would consume us both. \n\nHe was no more my husband than he was their son - and they had known him longer, had seen him grow and develop, and had devoted their lives to him. Even though we didn't share a great relationship, I had to respect their grief in order to be able to process my own. I had to stop believing that my grief was superior, more deserving, more real. It wasn't. \n\nSometimes one partner in a pas de deux has to be the bigger person. I moved, but I went out of my way to try to make sure fears were assuaged as much as I could. I didn't compromise beyond my limits, but I strove to understand and remain calm. It wasn't easy, and I was by no means perfect, but my children reaped the benefits in the long run. \n\nPeople can judge, here and elsewhere, but unless you have lost a spouse and the other parent of your children their judgment means nothing. I passed no judgment because I don't believe there is any to have. I wish you the most important thing there is right now - peace.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re thinking about yourself and your kids. Your wife\u2019s family is only thinking about themselves. They\u2019re acting like a planes won\u2019t  exist once you move away. \n\nTake the job, it\u2019s a good opportunity. Congratulations", "NTA\n\nYour MIL was way out of place for using her own daughter's memory to manipulate you, that's low on various ways. This is good for your career, your kids, and you on a personal level. Sometimes, after events that have a big impact on our lifes, going to another place to have a bit of a new start is good and healthy.\n\nIf the kids are okay with it, being them the most affected ones with this decision, then everything is okay and no one can criticize you.\n\nThe apology will come and I'm sure that your in-law's and you will find a way for them to visit the little ones as much as possible.", "\"I told him I'm willing to let them see the kids before we leave, but I need a direct apology from his wife and if either of them say anything negative about my decision, the visit will end immediately and I'll block them both.\"\n\nYTA\n\nThis isn't about you. This is about your kids and what's best for them. Stop making this about you and your ego.\n\nYes, they need food on the table. You're correct about that. They ALSO need a relationship with their grandparents. They have already lost their mom. Don't take their grandparents from them over a stupid fight. That would be immeasurably cruel to your children.\n\nMoving happens. That's fine. Congrats on the new job. But you ALSO need to make sure your children see the rest of their family. This is much bigger than your insulted feelings.", "NAH I think you just need to communicate better. Explain to them that had your wife been around this move wouldn't be needed as you wouldn't have to take a promotion that moved you and the kids from your friend and family to be able to provide for them. You already live 4 hours away and that isn't close enough to justify not taking an opportunity to provide better lives to them. Reiterate that you want them to be a part of their lives no matter how far away you live. Frankly I'd forgo asking for an apology and say you know you haven't had as much time to host them but you were readjusting to a world without your wife and hope they can understand that you weren't up to it but again you want them to be involved with your children. I'm sure MIL just freaked out over the fear that now that her daughter is gone she won't get to see or spend time with her grandkids much and you moving away brought it all up for her. Give them a bit of leeway. It seems they gave you some until this point. Please update.", "NTA even if they are your in-laws and they're their only grandkids it's your decision and your decision alone where you decide to take your kids and your life. I do understand MIL reaction tho not justifiable, that fear of their only grandkids moving away but it's not their life nor their decision. Plus you're doing this solely to be able to supporting 2 kids alone. They're really the center of attention, it's about them having a good life and growing up in a good environment. No matter what you decide they should always come first.", "NTA.  You have to do what is best for your family.  Your MIL has a right to her feelings, as do you and your FIL.  The difference is that your MIL is using her feelings as a club to beat you over the head.  \n\nMy parents are much the same way with their children and it\u2019s done nothing but push their kids and grandkids away.  But they still feel poorly treated and like victims.", "NAH. Their concerns are valid, but it's not like you're living next door right now. And as a single parent you can't just pass up good career advancement. Is this job opportunity good enough that you can make plans to fly out with the kids for a several week visit once a year? Something like you get an airbnb nearby for yourself and work remotely most of the time (no dealing with the inlaws), while the kids go stay with the grands. The grands can fly to you for other visits.", "NTA. I\u2019d make sure there isn\u2019t a way they can get grandparents rights, just to be safe tbh.", "NTA - But maybe help ease the situation by suggesting regular facetime-calls between the grandparents and your kids, plan on the next time you can come visit them for a holiday so they have something concrete to look forward to and to ensure them they're not being \"phased out\" or even a suggest that the kids can go stay with them for a few days during their  summer break.", "YTA. You ARE being pretty harsh. I have no issues with boundaries but they\u2019re allowed to be a little upset that they\u2019ll see their grandkids less, and now you\u2019re holding that over their heads?", "I don\u2019t know, you are not 100% right here a little AH to your kids. Like go ahead with the job, 100% agree on moving. But You just going to cut them out of your kids life\u2019s like that? Are you that selfish? Like, guess who will lose in this scenario? The kids. They already lost their mom. Are you telling me you won\u2019t make the effort to keep your kids in contact with their family, the family that knows your wife, that knows her stories of when she was younger and before you!!! Don\u2019t you think that adding is better than excluding? Like create a calendar with them, send your kids for a couple of weeks per summer and give yourself a break, I know you lost your wife but a little compassion with the people that lost their daughter, that your wife loved.", "NTA but did you have to be so ugly about it? Surely you understand their big fear is losing touch with your kids.\nTruly, how many more visits will they have? 5, maybe 10 for life?  Quit proving their fears right. Your kids are going to wonder some day.", "NTA, but if they want to see them, they too need to make an effort. Especially for the kids sake, it would be best to see their grandparents. Why not offer to send the kids to see their grandparents for a couple of weeks in the summer break. Give you a rest also.", "**YTA, ONLY for trying to pretend that their concerns are baseless.**\n\nOP you're not guilty for wanting to move away. It's your right. They don't own you. They don't own their grandchildren. **But from what you confessed, you need to acknowledge that you confirmed your wife's parents fears about you cutting them off/blocking them.**\n\nWhen they shared their concerns about losing their grandkids...you threatened to block them.\n\nThe truth is that after your wife passed...you did phase them out. Grandma noticed, said it and...you threatened to block her. Yes her attitude is shitty, but she ain't lie.\n\nWhen you demanded an apology from them for voicing their concerns that you'll block them because you'd already said that you'd block them...you threatened to block them again.\n\nOP why wouldn't they worry when you've confirmed it?\n\nFrom what you've said, they're not lying about your threats.\n\nYou want them to pretend to be happy. If they don't you'll deem that as negative...& will block them. \n\nIf your kids want to call & FaceTime their grandparents after you move, don't deny them that access. Now, move in peace.", "NTA You are right, but your MIL is also acting out of grief and fear. She lost her daughter and now she fears losing her grandchildren. That is no excuse for her behavior though. Stay firm with your boundaries, but also keep your compassion and make it a point to stay in touch and build a relationship with the kids if it is healthy for them. Over time she will see that you are not trying to destroy her relationship with them. People are not logical when in fear mode. Eventually she will see reason.", "ESH You have every right to move away and make a decision that is best for you and your family but I do think you were a bit harsh. MIL was a bit over the top but It may feel like they are losing their daughter all over again by losing the kids and just brought out some intense emotions. I would be a little more understanding the next time they reach out. If not for you than for the kids sake who I am sure love their grandparents as well.", "NAH You are entitled to take the promotion and relocate, and begin the next chapter of your life.  Good for you for discussing it with your kids too.\n\nI also understand how your in-laws must feel.  They lost their daughter, and don't get to spend the time with their grandkids that they used to, which would be tough enough on its own, but losing their daughter makes that even harder, and now you're moving even further away.\n\nI think making an effort with them would go a long way towards making everyone relax a bit - set up a weekly facetime call for them with the kids, or more if your kids want to.  Plan a visit for them to see the new place, and for you/your kids to go back and visit them.  Could they go for a long visit over a school break or summer?  Could you all go on a vacation elsewhere together?  It's not easy, and I get that you're frustrated, but you've all been through a lot of trauma and loss, and I hope you can come together, as your common goal is to love and support your kids.", "NTA\n\nI cannot imagine how this must make them feel, but they\u2019re in the wrong. Something awful happened to your family, and it\u2019s not ever okay for them to use that against you! Sometimes doing what\u2019s best for your kids means that other people won\u2019t understand the \u201cwhy\u201d or immediately jump to nefarious intent, when the reality is that life doesn\u2019t always give everyone the best-case scenario.", "NAH They are hurting and worried as those kids are a piece of their daughter.

Set up a day/time to start", "You are not an AH you're moving to make a better life you and your kids. But please understand how your in-laws feel. My son and his wife moved 1500 miles away from me and my wife taking our grandkids away that was a year ago and it still hurts. It is like being devoiced and losing your family. Be kind to them and be patient.", "Gentle ESH.\n\nRemember that your children also have a relationship with them, not as in laws but as grandparents.

No matter how much I loved my spouse, I would not have allowed this level of intrusiveness. One such visit a year would be normal for a lot of families. Several times a year? Oh HELL NO.\n\nAnd that's the problem. Your wife gave her parents far too much, so when you actually changed to a normal level of visits after her death, they regarded it as \"phasing them out of their grandkids life\" rather than \"sorry, but you don't get to have our home as your part-time residence any more\".\n\nTell them they are welcome to move to your new location if they want to see the kids more often, but you are doing what's best for you and your kids -- and if they attempt to manipulate or coerce your children regarding the move, you *will* cut off contact.", "Are your kids close to her parents?", "that is true, and i really understand\n\nthat comment was soap-opera level hurtful, and the op shouldnt easily let it slide", "ig that is one way to look at it?\n\nMy country has a big thing for respecting elders, so maybe thats why i think he flipped out\n\nthanks for explaining", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4d", "I mean she is right tho. Your wife would dislike this. And its her daughter. Yes you lost a wife but they lost a child", "Totally agree with respecting elders - to a point.

STFU about things you know nothing about.", "I agree that MIL lost respect, I'm just of the opinion that the OP should have understood that his FIL isn't objecting the move at all, and is supporting him. \nI re read the story, and I agree he didn't \"flip out\" exactly,", "[removed]", "> she probably wouldn\u2019t like you cutting ties with her parents. \n\nI'm not cutting ties with them.  I'm not keeping them from seeing their grandkids.  But I am not going to do it solely on their terms like my wife did.", "I like your shiny spine op!!! The grandparents aren\u2019t used to and don\u2019t want boundaries but boundaries are needed in all healthy relationships.  Mil tried manipulating you with your dead wife. As a widow myself I have nothing but respect for you op!", "But you are keeping them from seeing them. You literally said unless you get an apology they won\u2019t get to see them before you move. And presumably after the move as well", "Why are you arguing about what a departed (rest in peace) woman would want, one that you have never met, to her husband? \nThe move was discussed with the kids, and is in the best interest of dad and kids. Less struggling for the kids, cushioning their College funds, better opportunities all around. Logically (to me, and how OP alludes to his wife's personality), their mom would love for her kids to be taken care of and happy. MIL was manipulating and using quite a nasty tactic at that, she should apologize. You act improperly one must apologize, for the infraction.", "If the grandparents don\u2019t apologize for their huge overstep then they are the ones keeping themselves from the grandkids not op"]}
