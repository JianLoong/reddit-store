I work hard in my career and have a high-paying job (which Zack knows about), but I come from a poor family and grew up near the poverty line.\n\nZack works at a non-profit and is not as financially privileged as me, which I do not care about at all.

His comment implied that my parents must have helped me buy the house.\n\nIt felt incredibly condescending and patronizing and I also feel like he would not have said/thought this if I were older or if I were a man. His comment upset me and I called him out for being condescending/patronizing. He briefly apologized (\"oh sorry\") and tried to justify it with saying that he thought there were other signs I came from a rich family, like having an attended an elite college and driving a car my parents gave me (a 6 year old Honda Accord).\n\nI was still upset and he ended up leaving. Later today he texted me saying he had apologized for his assumption and that it wasn't cool that I called him condescending and patronizing for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole for this? In my opinion, if he wasn't a condescending and patronizing person, then he wouldn't have made that assumption in the first place?

I don't know where you are, but here in Aus the truth is most people can't afford a house without family help - so its an assumption that has now become ubiquitous........sadly.  There are a lot of stories about the 'bank of mum and dad' down here.\n\nThere is also a lot of evidence that there is a pay gap, and women have historically earned less - even for the same job - so for a woman to buy a $1mil house by themselves, they either need a really big salary at a young-ish age to even qualify for the mortgage, or they had help from family.  Given the widely held assumptions about salary etc, it's not wrong to assume you had help.  Clearly he doesn't know much about your background yet.\n\nTBH, I would assume your family helped you as well, and I am not a man - its just the world we live in where I am........it's possible he didn't mean it to be condescending at all.......this early in the relationship every word is being parsed for signs of 'red' or 'green'...\n\nedit - typo", "NTA \nHe is though.

His apology was too half-hearted", "Got it. IMHO, his comment isn\u2019t necessarily condescending/patronizing. I don\u2019t get a sense of him looking down on or asserting superiority over you. His comments are definitely showing his assumptions/biases based on age. (I\u2019m not sure about based on sex.) Granted, maybe tone or body language conveyed more negativity that doesn\u2019t come through the phrasing alone. Based on just the wording, though, I don\u2019t read/hear condescension. \n\nThat said, his remark upset you and its good you spoke up. In the end, he didn\u2019t need to make any comments about how you afforded your home. He could simply congratulate or be happy for you that you have a lovely home. I do wonder if things would\u2019ve evolved differently if you hadn\u2019t called him condescending/patronizing and instead said his words felt that way to you  (I.e. label the language versus him). I think the natural inclination to being labeled something negative is to try to explain or defend, which can create another issue. In addition, I think he could\u2019ve simply apologized and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to appear patronizing or condescending,\u201d and perhaps the situation would\u2019ve been squashed. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH.

You are loaded. You are really loaded. You are a 0.1 percenter. I get that don't lead with that on a date, but showing the house demonstartes that you came from money or you made an absurd amount quickly.\n\nLet me re-headline your question: I earn so much money that people older than me with established jobs just cannot get how wealthy I am.

Being given a car means no car payments, which means more savings and/or less debt, which means a higher home loan amount, which means a more expensive home.  Having parents pay for school (and/or expenses during school), especially an elite school, means a higher paying job after graduation with less or no school loan repayment, which means more savings and/or less debt, which means higher loan amount, which means means a more expensive home.

But in today\u2019s economic system, hard work rarely gets anyone a million dollars, and I think his comments were a reflection of that. You weren\u2019t out of line to say what you said either, but if everyone can apologize and recognize how they hurt the other person, then y\u2019all can move on.", "In the US, 4 out of 5 homeowners under the age of 30 had financial help from parents, so yeah, that's a good guess. \nhttps://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/05/25/american-homebuyers-finanancial-help-parents", "Yeah, I thought it was now considered the norm. I don\u2019t think OP is an asshole but uh\u2026this is the reality in a HCOL city, even with a high salary.", "Instead of immediately branding him an evil sexist man, why not cool the jets a little. \n\nYou have to admit that OP is the exception to the rule. I'm also from a HCOL area and the property market is literally a joke. There are 40 year old couples struggling to buy houses. For OP to be able to buy a million dollar home in this economy is out of the ordinary.\n\nHe could simply be of the mindset that the only people buying houses are those above 40, property managers, the rich or all of the above. That's a very common mentality where I live and while I wouldn't outright say that a 29 year old who owns a million dollar house in a HCOL area had the bank of Mum and Dad to help, it wouldn't be an unreasonable assumption.", ">As if a 29 year old woman could not afford property on her own by working hard.\n\nThis isn't common. In HCOL areas there are couples in their 40s struggling to buy so for OP to buy at 29 is very very impressive. \n\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/money/planning-and-budgeting/parents-cough-up-record-100-000-to-help-children-buy-first-home-20220408-p5abza.html \n\nOf homeowners under the age of 30 in the US, 4 out of 5 said they had financial help from their parents and 1 in 10 said they did not.\n\nhttps://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/05/25/american-homebuyers-finanancial-help-parents\n\n(credit to u/Lowbacca1977)\n\nI'm not going to call him a sexist for making the logical assumption. Obviously he shouldn't have assumed an he is an AH, but calling him a sexist is too far", "I think there's still an issue of being blinded by some privilege there (being in such a position and with such a high income that you don't realize that most people who own homes got financial help from family and plenty of people that want to afford homes can't, and framing things implicitly that all of them just didn't work hard enough is a whole lot) but it seems to be acquired since OP says they grew up in a poor family. Though given they were given a car of that value, that does really seem to shift that into a past tense and that her present family is not poor\n\nStill agree, the boyfriend was wrong to make he assumption, but it's hardly a surprising assumption", "It was a backhanded compliment. He wasn't really congratulating her or complimenting her family. Just assuming and saying she was lucky to be born into good circumstances otherwise she wouldn't have been able to purchase her home.\n\nIf you worked out at the gym all the time and kept a strict diet and tried to keep yourself in great shape and someone looked at you and said \"wow, must be nice to be born with good genetics\" is that a compliment to your family too?", "I don't think it was intended rude either. I would have responded proudly something like \"Nope! I did it all myself\" and continued the evening. They sound like they are living opposite lives. He doesn't understand (or maybe she never told him) how much money she has. She doesn't understand that it's not a common accomplishment, especially these days.", "He was still condescending. He could\u2019ve admitted it and apologized for it. I would be mortified if I made that assumption and it turned out wrong.", "I live in Sydney and I second this!", "Well, he could\u2019ve asked, since it is a reasonable assumption, but instead he said 'it's awesome when family can help', for no reason whatsoever.", "Yeah, that got me.  \"I said I was sorry (so forgive me already).\"  Nah... move on my dear.", "\"Maybe you should try to get to know me before making assumptions\"", "Can I ask what city? I'm from Melbourne and it is so bad here that the term \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" is common and even our government encouraged parents to chip in. While he was an AH to assume, it may not have come from a place of underestimating you and more just that's how it usually is.", "My comment was a long winded way of saying \u201cNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity or awkwardness\u201d \ud83e\udd23\n\nDude could totally be an asshole. He could also be extremely acquainted with the taste of shoe leather.", "He knows she makes good money, I can\u2019t imagine she would have told him exactly how much.\n\nWhere I am making good money - being an engineer, say, or working in tech - is still not going to get you a single family home.", "It does sound like your financial privilege is somewhat blinding you on this. There was a poll conducted by [Yougov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/05/25/american-homebuyers-finanancial-help-parents) last year, and only 1 in 10 homeowners under 30 said that their parents didn't financially help (79% said they did, and there's an 11% not sure). Even in the 30-44 age range, most people did get financial help from their parents. So though the assumption is wrong here, it's the dominant way people under 30 own a home, and still the majority way for under 45.\n\nAnd as this is home ownership, these numbers are likely even more extreme in areas where the barrier to home ownership is even higher. Just as already having it known that you're already getting some pretty big financial support from family by way of that car also factors into this, because I think you seem to think that big of a gift is a lot more normal than it really is.\n\nAlso leads to questions of if you've just said \"high salary\" or an actual value, because those aren't necessarily the same thing. I'm in an area that's expensive enough that a salary I'd consider a \"high salary\" still isn't enough to afford a house. For example, the salary reported to afford a median house in Los Angeles apparently passed $200,000 recently due to housing prices increasing. Which means someone making a \"high salary\" because they make over 100,000 still isn't making enough to afford a house.\n\n\nThe natural thinking is that someone relatively young (and I'm talking under 45 here) owning a home in a high cost of living area got help from family because otherwise it's not particularly possible for most people to own a home. And your putting it down to \"but they should assume I worked hard for this\" ignores that there's a whole lot of people, also working very hard, that can't afford houses. The most common thing that is tipping the scales in favor of home ownership being obtainable is usually \"financial help from parents\" and not \"hard work\".", "Yes, how dare you accurately describe his shitty behavior. Zach is just jealous. He has shown you his true self and you should move one, because dealing with such infantile behavior is beneath you or any other adult.", "Property market is a mess in both mate. Rentals are even worse", ">Well, he could\u2019ve asked\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight yes, but that's also a very blunt and potentially rude question. I can understand why he would avoid that question. Assuming tho isn't the solution. Probably should have avoided the entire topic.", "I mean I would have assumed the same thing, and it has nothing to do with gender. I do not personally know a single person my age who owns a house that did not buy it with either settlement money or money from their parents. I am thirty and live in an area with a low cost of living. If someone my age said they owned a $1mil home, I do not care who you are my immediate assumption is that you came from a rich family.", "Exactly this guy is bitter and with her being a high income earner (not recognising she is a high income earner) and making these assumptions, it just spells trouble. OP can find someone her age on her financial level", "She did not say she told him what she makes. She only said that she told him she has a high income, and that can mean very different things to different people. In my area, anything over 60k is high income, and in Manhattan, it's over 500k. To a guy working nonprofit, the term high income probably means something closer to the low end of that scale, which is not exactly enough to buy a million-dollar home without help.", "It\u2019s his reaction afterwards that\u2019s so bad. Getting upset at her because he \u201capologized\u201d and salty that she called him out on his assumptions.  \n\nAnd then saying \u201cwell you went to this fancy school\u201d, like she didn\u2019t do it all herself. \n\nI get mad when people assume my family helped me when they were the opposite.

It's not impossible but you have to have a massive income to pull that off. You have to save up at least $100-200k for the down deposit, no small task at 29. And then you are looking at mortgage payments of $5000-6000 every month. That's more than most people's total salary!", "Never said there weren't any.", "This is a repeat from another of my posts, but \"High income\" has very different meanings to different people. It means 60k or above in my area, and 500k and above in Manhattan.

Hmm.", "He certainly knows what she does for a living...", "A regular high paying job isn't enough to get a $1M house at 29. OP is easily in the top 1% of income earners for her age. Like I don't think people here are appreciating just how money that is.", "I mean we're talking 150-200k/yr probably, yes. Clearly she does make that much money.\n\nAlso clearly, she knows his profession and states he has an idea of her salary, so it's reasonable to assume he knows her profession also. If he knows she went to an elite college, lives alone in a HCOL area, and knows her job, and knows that she is excelling at her job, it's frankly stupid to attribute her ability to buy things as \"good thing family is there to help us buy stuff\". \n\nWe're not talking about him making an assumption of a random 29 y/o person at a party. If that were the case, I'd agree with you. This guy 100% must know shes in the top few percentile of earners for her age, and he assumes for no reason that its top few percent but not top 1-2 percent? Thats just a weird jump."]}
