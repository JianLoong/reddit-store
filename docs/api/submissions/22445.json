Later today he texted me saying he had apologized for his assumption and that it wasn't cool that I called him condescending and patronizing for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole for this?

I don't know where you are, but here in Aus the truth is most people can't afford a house without family help - so its an assumption that has now become ubiquitous........sadly.  There are a lot of stories about the 'bank of mum and dad' down here.\n\nThere is also a lot of evidence that there is a pay gap, and women have historically earned less - even for the same job - so for a woman to buy a $1mil house by themselves, they either need a really big salary at a young-ish age to even qualify for the mortgage, or they had help from family.  Given the widely held assumptions about salary etc, it's not wrong to assume you had help.  Clearly he doesn't know much about your background yet.\n\nTBH, I would assume your family helped you as well, and I am not a man - its just the world we live in where I am........it's possible he didn't mean it to be condescending at all.......this early in the relationship every word is being parsed for signs of 'red' or 'green'...\n\nedit - typo", "NTA \nHe is though.

You need to look at any other comments he might make to see if there is a pattern of insecure behavior. If so, dump his ass with a quickness.\n\nBut taking this specific comment by itself, I can see why he made it. Working hard and/or working in a lucrative field does not mean that you\u2019ll necessarily be able to afford a home where you live. For many of us we DID and still DO need our parents help to purchase a home. My parents gifted me money so I could buy down my rate.\n\nIt\u2019s not looking down on your hard work.

His comments are definitely showing his assumptions/biases based on age. (I\u2019m not sure about based on sex.) Granted, maybe tone or body language conveyed more negativity that doesn\u2019t come through the phrasing alone. Based on just the wording, though, I don\u2019t read/hear condescension. \n\nThat said, his remark upset you and its good you spoke up. In the end, he didn\u2019t need to make any comments about how you afforded your home. He could simply congratulate or be happy for you that you have a lovely home. I do wonder if things would\u2019ve evolved differently if you hadn\u2019t called him condescending/patronizing and instead said his words felt that way to you  (I.e. label the language versus him). I think the natural inclination to being labeled something negative is to try to explain or defend, which can create another issue. In addition, I think he could\u2019ve simply apologized and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to appear patronizing or condescending,\u201d and perhaps the situation would\u2019ve been squashed. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH.

You are loaded. You are really loaded. You are a 0.1 percenter. I get that don't lead with that on a date, but showing the house demonstartes that you came from money or you made an absurd amount quickly.\n\nLet me re-headline your question: I earn so much money that people older than me with established jobs just cannot get how wealthy I am.

Being given a car means no car payments, which means more savings and/or less debt, which means a higher home loan amount, which means a more expensive home.  Having parents pay for school (and/or expenses during school), especially an elite school, means a higher paying job after graduation with less or no school loan repayment, which means more savings and/or less debt, which means higher loan amount, which means means a more expensive home.

There was a poll conducted by [Yougov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/05/25/american-homebuyers-finanancial-help-parents) last year, and only 1 in 10 homeowners under 30 said that their parents didn't financially help (79% said they did, and there's an 11% not sure). Even in the 30-44 age range, most people did get financial help from their parents. So though the assumption is wrong here, it's the dominant way people under 30 own a home, and still the majority way for under 45.\n\nAnd as this is home ownership, these numbers are likely even more extreme in areas where the barrier to home ownership is even higher. Just as already having it known that you're already getting some pretty big financial support from family by way of that car also factors into this, because I think you seem to think that big of a gift is a lot more normal than it really is.\n\nAlso leads to questions of if you've just said \"high salary\" or an actual value, because those aren't necessarily the same thing. I'm in an area that's expensive enough that a salary I'd consider a \"high salary\" still isn't enough to afford a house. For example, the salary reported to afford a median house in Los Angeles apparently passed $200,000 recently due to housing prices increasing. Which means someone making a \"high salary\" because they make over 100,000 still isn't making enough to afford a house.\n\n\nThe natural thinking is that someone relatively young (and I'm talking under 45 here) owning a home in a high cost of living area got help from family because otherwise it's not particularly possible for most people to own a home. And your putting it down to \"but they should assume I worked hard for this\" ignores that there's a whole lot of people, also working very hard, that can't afford houses.

Especially funding the elite school while young.\n\nBecause I don't know any young people who make that kind of money who aren't flashing their pictures all over certain websites or doing some kind of content creation with social media or whatever, or winning the lottery.\nNot many young people can afford to send themselves to an elite school or college, that's usually paid for by parents or by getting scholarship deals.\nSo although wrong, his assumption was pretty understandable, and he never made excuses, just explained how he reached the incorrect conclusion. \nBut they're both adults, if they can't sort this out without name calling then it's a poor show.\nPersonally I don't see any need to go into such detail with the apology, it was not a major offense.

I can't...\n\nFirst of all, while saying that you were raised in a poor household, your attitude to wealth indicates your upper class status. Either you quickly forgot your past or your past isn't as poor as you claim. Having the ability to buy a super expensive house in a HCOL area is the pinacle of privilege as well as of upper class living. In the current state of capitalism, when low wages are paid and the labour class is exploited and squeezed to the max to make profits for a few privileged individuals, it is not at all outlandish or odd to assume that your family helped you to pay for this house. \n\nStatistically it is way more likely and I would have assumed the same. The comment he made was also not rude and probably a slip of tongue or he didn't really think before speaking - this happens to the best of us. The fact that you went to an elite school and everything which he apparently knows about makes his line of thinking even more reasonable. The fact that you were apparently deeply offended by his comment should make you stop and ask yourself some hard questions.

She absolutely DID 'call him out for being condescending and patronising'. And she was still upset (after his apology), when they parted. So when there's an unresolved issue/bad feelings, then yes - people might contact the other person to discuss it. It certainly isn't contacting her for 'no reason'. \n\nYou also don't seem to understand life isn't a psychology textbook, and it can be far more nuanced than the 'perfection' you apparently expect (from the concepts you misapply). It's NOT automatically a 'non-apology', if somebody explains why they did something/thought something. Indeed, in many cases, people actually WANT to understand, why somebody did/said something.\n\nIf somebody has done something serious like cheating, and says something like 'Sorry, but I did it because you weren't giving me enough sex....' - THAT'S an inappropriate 'non-apology'. But this post IS different. If it's something like a minor (unintended) misunderstanding, it's absolutely appropriate to explain how it happened - because sometimes, genuine misunderstandings DO occur. \n\nThis was the first time anything he's said to her is questionable, and it's extremely unclear he had any negative, condescending attitude in saying it. That could potentially be her own misinterpretation, from her own issues. \n\nIf he genuinely didn't have condescending/patronising emotions, then he has a right to say and explain that. It's wholly unreasonable in every dispute, to think you think only ONE person's feelings/interpretations are valid/correct (and the other person must 100% validate the first person's every interpretation, otherwise they are 'gaslighting' the first person). \n\nHe can genuinely feel sorry, if his word choice could have been better - and genuinely sorry, that he made a mistaken assumption. But if he genuinely disagrees with HER assumptions of his intent, he can voice that. And if he feels offended she still assumes the worse of him - despite his explanation and apology - he has a right to say that. The proportionate response (with no history of being 'patronising', and it being very unclear he was trying to patronise), would be to accept his apology for his assumption - and give him the benefit of the doubt unless it happened again. \n\nInstead, insisting that one person has to 100% agree with the other person, is frankly wrong - and potentially abusive in itself. You should never try to bully somebody into 'admitting' to emotions/intents, that they may genuinely never have had. That can be very much 'gaslighting' in itself.

Life is far more complex, than how you're currently applying concepts to it.", "And then he demanded an apology from her!", "I was at the poverty line for a bit as kid.

You really said a car is often inherited, that sounds very fortunate since most people living near poverty cant afford any car and use public transportation. Nobody is minimizing her work by complimenting their support unless they say you would not have had it without them. Don\u2019t minimize the work near poverty parents/family put into getting her a car that works good to the point she still uses it today and never had to worry about buying a new car during her grind time.

He was simply admiring where you live, and how nice it was to have your family there to help you. Whether his comment was accurate or not, it was intended to be a compliment, not an insult. \n\nI do believe that his apology was a bit passive-aggressive, but I would've given the same apology had I been in this situation.\n\nThis isn't meant to be rude or upsetting for anyone, just to put that out there.", "This all seems like a big over-reaction to me. It sounds like Zack just doesn't understand the world of people who can buy million-dollar homes. He might very well say the same thing if one of his male buddies bought the house. He made an innocent - if not ignorant - comment, and it blew up to the point where OP broke up with him.\n\nOP did Zack a favor.", "ESH. He made a comment containing an incorrect assumption that upset you, you communicated why it upset you and instead of understanding that and giving a real apology, he acted like you got upset for no reason. He\u2019s an asshole because of how he dismissed your feelings. \n\nYou are 29 year old living in a HCOL area with a $1+ million home on a single income. That is rare these days and it is a totally fair assumption that you obtained outside assistance to get it. You\u2019ve been dating the guy for a month, I doubt he knows every detail of yours and your family\u2019s finances in years past and currently. Both men and women struggle greatly to become homeowners these days. Having bought a house yourself I would think you would understand the societal circumstances surrounding homeownership and it\u2019s numerous related crises. I wouldn\u2019t apologize because his reaction was not respectful to you, but I would use this as a learning experience to not react so strongly to what is a totally fair comment, absent some other negative indication.", "After the edit, I do not think what he said was condescending. It is nice having family that helps you out, this is the norm of normal families when they have money. Just sounds like normal small talk to me. Really, is it a bad thing to have family helping you getting a house or something? \n\nI think YTA how you reacted.", "NAH\n\nIf a 29yo showed me their million dollar house I'd be skeptical too, I think most people would. You are well below the average age of a new homeowner and that house is way way above average.\n\nGranted, he was an idiot for actually saying it and you are right to be offended because your parents did in fact not help.\n\nHe made a reasonable assumption that just happened to be wrong. You aren't wrong for being upset by that.", "NAH.\n\nLook, you worked hard for what you have. He doesn't know that. All he sees is someone that has it great - at a young age, seemingly, unlike himeself.\n\nWas his assumptions of what you have, wrong? Sure. But TBF, you are a minority - 1M dollar home at 29, after graduating from a elite college?.. Not many people can accomplish that. \n\nI honestly don't think it has anything to do with your gender. I'd be hella impressed regardless.\n\nBut you made up your mind, that he was patronizing and condescending you, based off assumptions. You reacted quickly based on what that comment meant to you - versus just making him impressed that YOU did it by yourself (minus the honda from your family). And TBF, you should expect people to think these things.. because you are a financial minority.", "NAH especially since he doubled down after his \"apology\".  However, as a 29 year old Millenial, you may want to grow a thicker skin as people are likely going to make this same assumption again in your life.  Unfortunately, a lot of people in this economy are going to assume that someone so young had help purchasing a million dollar home (especially if you date people older than yourself).  Congrats on your success!", "ESH. He should've apologized and left it at that, but you blew it out of proportion too.\n\n\n>we were talking about how the city is so expensive to live in and he said \"it's cool how you were able to buy this place, it's awesome when family can help\"\n\nUnless his tone was dripping with arrogance and condescension, I can't see how this phrase is condescending. You've know eachother 1 month, I doubt he knows your family history very well, same for you, and it's not unreasonable to think that parents helped their kid buy a house, it's extremely common in this day and age, honestly I would've said something along the same lines, or be genuinely surprised you bough it on your own, that doesn't automatically make it an insult, both of you need to get a grip.", "YTA Op\u2026. Yea sorry but If ANYONE  under 30 owns a 1m+ house in a HCOL area coming from an elite college + a fairly recent car? I\u2019m going to assume they had help, it\u2019s statistically  Very unlikely that OP wouldn\u2019t have had help, in this case she didn\u2019t. Now before someone says \u201cassumptions\u201d from what he knew about her in the month, his assumption IS REASONABLE, and most people make assumptions some way in daily life, it\u2019s not some rare thing.\n\nHis apology did seem half assed, but I would give a half assed apology  if OP sounded that defensive in person.\n\nIf I see someone wearing a hi res vest and a hard hat in a construction zone am I am asshole for assuming they might be a construction worker? Of course not, could I be wrong and they are a engineer on-site? yes but if assuming that this engineer is a construction worker is insulting please explain to me why that is so and why they should be offended to be considered a construction worker?", "YTA, super overreaction, probably because you are insecure about how much help you have actually had and worry about it taking away from your hard work.  You can have both it is okay. You worked hard and had help (free car, obviously not poor). What he said was such a minor statement to have your reaction to. Then breaking up over text because again so insecure. Probably did him a huge favor.", "NAH: People say tactless things sometimes but that doesn\u2019t mean it comes from a bad place. Don\u2019t be so sensitive. Elite college, $1M house, gifted car\u2026those are all the trappings of a privileged background. Btw, there\u2019s nothing wrong with coming from that background either. It seems like he said it in passing. He profusely apologized after you said it hurt your feelings. Get over it.", "The more I read the more I feel like I have to lean to a light YTA. I don\u2019t think the way he said that was condescending as it was presented here.", "ehhh NAH, fair to get annoyed he thought that, but at his age? every single person i know in that age cohort that owns a house had to get familial help.", "In this day and age I assume pretty much any millennial with a house had help from their parents...I worked high paying jobs since 18, and I still couldn't have done it without their help due to COL and everything else.\n\nNAH imo, I can see why he assumed and I can see why it annoyed you", "NAH but I do think you overreacted. I don\u2019t think his comment had anything to do with the fact that you\u2019re female but probably more due to you being so young. I also don\u2019t think he was being condescending. He was wrong to assume you couldn\u2019t afford it on your own but I don\u2019t think what he said was so horrible (I read the edit).  \n\nOwning a $1M house at 29 is pretty unusual and if he\u2019s working in the non-profit sector it\u2019s likely that he\u2019s not seen that kind of money with any of the people around him. I would have been shocked if at the age of 29, one of my friends bought a $500K house. (I\u2019m older than you so tried to come up with a comparable figure) Personally I don\u2019t think that comment alone is worth breaking up with him but I obviously don\u2019t know anything else about your relationship. Could you have been defensive about it because of your experience at an \u201celite college\u201d? Lots of kids at those schools do get things handed to them and maybe that has had an effect on you?", "ESH\n\nOne off hand comment shouldn\u2019t dissuade you but I don\u2019t blame him for not expecting that you could have had help with a home that expensive. \n\nYes, it\u2019s understandable why you\u2019re hurt but a little comment like that shouldn\u2019t ruin something you say is good. Don\u2019t let pride ruin things.", "NAH \n\nOP no offense but I'm around your age. I mostly assume almost anybody that owns a house in their 20s probably had some help from family. Doesn't matter what gender. Older people are even more likely to feel this way about someone in their 20s that's a homeowner. \n\nMaybe it's a bad assumption but the reality is, it's very unusual for someone in their 20s to own a house, nevertheless one in a high COL area. \n\nThis Zack guy could have something in his own circles where he or people close to him received financial help. I wouldn't hold it strongly against him. If anything, use this as an opportunity to open up more about your career if you haven't already. And your family life for that matter. \n\nIf you do that, he could get a better understanding of who you are and why you may feel a certain way about this accusation.", "NAH was gonna be my initial response as this sounds like the biggest nothing burger of the century. But if you seriously ended things over text over this, YTA and he dodged a bullet. You sound incredibly insecure about coming from a poorer family. Most people would have responded proudly that they bought this one themself because they were lucky enough to get a good paying job. They wouldnt get this butthurt over it. Also, who in the heck is able to afford the downpayment on a $1M house at your age WITHOUT help from their parents? Like, bravo, but you should really look inward if you were that upset by such a minor comment when you have accomplished so much to be proud of.", "yta", "I think it had everything to do with and not sex.\n\nI know two people who have brought a house pre 35 without help and they did so by consciously saving from the age of 16.\n\nSo it took them roughly 16 years of saving consistently.\n\nI know another 4/5 people who have houses all together and everyone else isn't close and likely won't ever be.\n\nThis is where houses are c200-300k\n\nSo for you to live in a 1m house at such a young age. As a single person, the logical answer is parental help.\n\nTjat said. Raising it as an assumption rather then just asking was a bit shitty but not particularly a dick move.", "NAH\n\nSounds like you ended this relationship over nothing. \n\nIf anyone that hurts your feelings means your relationship ends there and then, with no room for growth you\u2019re going to be going though so many \n\nHe apologised and told you what hurt him. You both could have reconciled.", "YTA- this is me just basing this on information provided and your edit. You have a home with a little over $1M. However, while you (and I hate this phrase with a purple passion) pulled yourself up by your bootstraps, you own an expensive home and a gifted, nice car, on top of the fact you have a degree from a college that would sooner accept a donor\u2019s kids or the rich elite, where the tuition is essentially a new house. What else was supposed to assume after knowing you for a month.", "Did he know they gave you a car?", "Really sus that you never actually mention the comment he made. Let's you spin this exactly how you want without interpretation.", "NAH: I think a lot of people would probably guess that a single 29 year old with a car, a private college education, and a million dollar house had help from their family. He put his foot in his mouth, but everyone does it from time to time. I don\u2019t think he meant any harm by it, and the fact that he apologized instead of getting aggravated could attest to that", "YTA. You\u2019re 29\u2013not a stretch that maybe you had help purchasing a $1million dollar home in a HCOL area. \n\nHe made a comment seeming to compliment having a supportive family, which you admit having a car that was gifted by your family. \n\nI\u2019d say he dodged a bullet if you get that bent out of shape over a simple statement. I also think there is some immaturity on your part because you immediately got offended and called him condescending and patronizing. I would think the more natural response would have been to proudly state that while you had their support you were able to work hard to achieve a goal of having such a nice house that you didn\u2019t have growing up. \n\nMight be time to look into your deeper issues.", "Even if youd parents helped you, you should be proud that your parents are there for you. Every person has a different journey. You be of who you are, and attract similar people. \n\nHe made that assumption because that's what you see in the media these days, that houses are so expensive millennials can't buy them. \n\nWhat he said don't read condescending but depending on how you say it can be very condescending, which I think you caught on. \n\nJust be aware, he will have other generalizations too. Glad you ended things.", "Who cares if your parents help by your house.  People need help and that shame is that more people don\u2019t get help from their parents when their parents can afford it.  Anyone who thinks less of you is not worth knowing more", "NAH, nothing wrong with assuming a 29yo driving an older Honda Accord would need help purchasing a million dollar home.", "YTA\n\nWithout knowing the comment he made, or whether he knew your parents were lower socioeconomic, it's hard to side with you here.\n\nYou are living alone in a $1 million house that you have apparently bought yourself.\n\nAt 29, that is a very rare thing and parental help is not an unreasonable assumption or anything to be ashamed of.", "Not to mention, went to an elite college and driving a late model car .", "Poverty line parents that can hand over a six year old car?", "I don't get all the NTA's... OP seems far more Ahish.", "It\u2019s also worth pointing out that \u201chelp\u201d can mean a lot of things. My gf\u2019s brother bought a 500k house on his own but only because he was able to live rent and bill free his entire life and had parents who paid for his schooling and transportation.", "Scrolled too far for this, I don't think OP knows what poor is.", "Why is it such a stretch to think people should ask before assuming?", "People are blowing the guy in Ops comment way out of proportion.", "> *It was not,sincere, as evidenced*:\n> *I called him condescending and patronizing for no reason*.\n\nClassic DARVO - ing on his part.  OP is well rid of him.\n\nNTA, OP\n\nDeny - Argue - Reverse - Victim - Offender", "Handwaving away a $30k gift like this suggests to me that OP might not be as self-made as she likes to project.", "Because OP was the one who was actually in the room with him & could hear his tone and SHE thought he was being condescending. \n\nEven without the tone, there's not zero reason, him being condescending is an option and hardly a wildcard.\n\nWhat is an assumption is you deciding you know better than the person who was actually part of the conversation. It's also pretty condescending.", "You're very accurate in that there's definitely somebody who didn't read properly...", "This is where my wife and I butt heads. She always thinks my intent must be the way she perceived it. I'll say that's  not how I meant it or whatever, but genuinely try to apologize for making her feel hurt or upset while maintaining that I did not mean to. She'll say I'm gaslighting her but it feels like reverse gaslighting to me, or just using the word gaslighting to gaslight me lol. I get dumbfounded by it sometimes.
