His comment upset me and I called him out for being condescending/patronizing. He briefly apologized (\"oh sorry\") and tried to justify it with saying that he thought there were other signs I came from a rich family, like having an attended an elite college and driving a car my parents gave me (a 6 year old Honda Accord).\n\nI was still upset and he ended up leaving. Later today he texted me saying he had apologized for his assumption and that it wasn't cool that I called him condescending and patronizing for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole for this? In my opinion, if he wasn't a condescending and patronizing person, then he wouldn't have made that assumption in the first place?

I don't know where you are, but here in Aus the truth is most people can't afford a house without family help - so its an assumption that has now become ubiquitous........sadly.  There are a lot of stories about the 'bank of mum and dad' down here.\n\nThere is also a lot of evidence that there is a pay gap, and women have historically earned less - even for the same job - so for a woman to buy a $1mil house by themselves, they either need a really big salary at a young-ish age to even qualify for the mortgage, or they had help from family.  Given the widely held assumptions about salary etc, it's not wrong to assume you had help.  Clearly he doesn't know much about your background yet.\n\nTBH, I would assume your family helped you as well, and I am not a man - its just the world we live in where I am........it's possible he didn't mean it to be condescending at all.......this early in the relationship every word is being parsed for signs of 'red' or 'green'...\n\nedit - typo", "NTA \nHe is though.

You need to look at any other comments he might make to see if there is a pattern of insecure behavior. If so, dump his ass with a quickness.\n\nBut taking this specific comment by itself, I can see why he made it. Working hard and/or working in a lucrative field does not mean that you\u2019ll necessarily be able to afford a home where you live. For many of us we DID and still DO need our parents help to purchase a home. My parents gifted me money so I could buy down my rate.\n\nIt\u2019s not looking down on your hard work.

His comments are definitely showing his assumptions/biases based on age. (I\u2019m not sure about based on sex.) Granted, maybe tone or body language conveyed more negativity that doesn\u2019t come through the phrasing alone. Based on just the wording, though, I don\u2019t read/hear condescension. \n\nThat said, his remark upset you and its good you spoke up. In the end, he didn\u2019t need to make any comments about how you afforded your home. He could simply congratulate or be happy for you that you have a lovely home. I do wonder if things would\u2019ve evolved differently if you hadn\u2019t called him condescending/patronizing and instead said his words felt that way to you  (I.e. label the language versus him). I think the natural inclination to being labeled something negative is to try to explain or defend, which can create another issue.

You are loaded. You are really loaded. You are a 0.1 percenter. I get that don't lead with that on a date, but showing the house demonstartes that you came from money or you made an absurd amount quickly.\n\nLet me re-headline your question: I earn so much money that people older than me with established jobs just cannot get how wealthy I am.

Being given a car means no car payments, which means more savings and/or less debt, which means a higher home loan amount, which means a more expensive home.  Having parents pay for school (and/or expenses during school), especially an elite school, means a higher paying job after graduation with less or no school loan repayment, which means more savings and/or less debt, which means higher loan amount, which means means a more expensive home.  And so on.  This is the ripple effect of privilege, and coming from poverty has the reverse effect.

There was a poll conducted by [Yougov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/05/25/american-homebuyers-finanancial-help-parents) last year, and only 1 in 10 homeowners under 30 said that their parents didn't financially help (79% said they did, and there's an 11% not sure). Even in the 30-44 age range, most people did get financial help from their parents. So though the assumption is wrong here, it's the dominant way people under 30 own a home, and still the majority way for under 45.\n\nAnd as this is home ownership, these numbers are likely even more extreme in areas where the barrier to home ownership is even higher. Just as already having it known that you're already getting some pretty big financial support from family by way of that car also factors into this, because I think you seem to think that big of a gift is a lot more normal than it really is.\n\nAlso leads to questions of if you've just said \"high salary\" or an actual value, because those aren't necessarily the same thing. I'm in an area that's expensive enough that a salary I'd consider a \"high salary\" still isn't enough to afford a house. For example, the salary reported to afford a median house in Los Angeles apparently passed $200,000 recently due to housing prices increasing. Which means someone making a \"high salary\" because they make over 100,000 still isn't making enough to afford a house.\n\n\nThe natural thinking is that someone relatively young (and I'm talking under 45 here) owning a home in a high cost of living area got help from family because otherwise it's not particularly possible for most people to own a home. And your putting it down to \"but they should assume I worked hard for this\" ignores that there's a whole lot of people, also working very hard, that can't afford houses.

Especially funding the elite school while young.\n\nBecause I don't know any young people who make that kind of money who aren't flashing their pictures all over certain websites or doing some kind of content creation with social media or whatever, or winning the lottery.\nNot many young people can afford to send themselves to an elite school or college, that's usually paid for by parents or by getting scholarship deals.\nSo although wrong, his assumption was pretty understandable, and he never made excuses, just explained how he reached the incorrect conclusion. \nBut they're both adults, if they can't sort this out without name calling then it's a poor show.\nPersonally I don't see any need to go into such detail with the apology, it was not a major offense. It was basically a slip of the tongue.\n\nHe didn't evade, he didn't make an excuse or blame her. He said sorry and then expressed he felt her name calling was unnecessary.

I feel OP was reading too much into what seemed like an innocent slip of the tongue due to what was probably miscommunication/misinterpreted.\n\nPersonally, I see it as this, if she even remotely cared for or liked him, she would not have gone immediately on the attack and said that in reply to his assumption, she would have corrected him and moved on, given another chance and then if the same thing happened again in the future she would have full reasoning for accusing him because that would show he didn't change. \nBut if someone calls me patronising or condescending instead of explaining or talking to me, due to something that was an innocent assumption I'm going to immediately be more defensive right off the bat.\n\nI'm yet to hear anyone give me a reason as to why she couldn't just correct his assumption with the facts and truth in a nice way, without calling names, state that she did it herself with no help and then wait for his response, which would more than likely be something very positive and impressive. \nAnd then it's done.
