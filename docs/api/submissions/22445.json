His comment implied that my parents must have helped me buy the house.\n\nIt felt incredibly condescending and patronizing and I also feel like he would not have said/thought this if I were older or if I were a man. His comment upset me and I called him out for being condescending/patronizing. He briefly apologized (\"oh sorry\") and tried to justify it with saying that he thought there were other signs I came from a rich family, like having an attended an elite college and driving a car my parents gave me (a 6 year old Honda Accord).\n\nI was still upset and he ended up leaving. Later today he texted me saying he had apologized for his assumption and that it wasn't cool that I called him condescending and patronizing for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole for this? In my opinion, if he wasn't a condescending and patronizing person, then he wouldn't have made that assumption in the first place?

People like this think they are smarter than you but you got lucky because your parents paid for your house - or any other excuse they can think of because you have worked harder than them.

I don't know where you are, but here in Aus the truth is most people can't afford a house without family help - so its an assumption that has now become ubiquitous........sadly.  There are a lot of stories about the 'bank of mum and dad' down here.\n\nThere is also a lot of evidence that there is a pay gap, and women have historically earned less - even for the same job - so for a woman to buy a $1mil house by themselves, they either need a really big salary at a young-ish age to even qualify for the mortgage, or they had help from family.  Given the widely held assumptions about salary etc, it's not wrong to assume you had help.  Clearly he doesn't know much about your background yet.\n\nTBH, I would assume your family helped you as well, and I am not a man - its just the world we live in where I am........it's possible he didn't mean it to be condescending at all.......this early in the relationship every word is being parsed for signs of 'red' or 'green'...\n\nedit - typo", "NTA \nHe is though.

Working hard and/or working in a lucrative field does not mean that you\u2019ll necessarily be able to afford a home where you live. For many of us we DID and still DO need our parents help to purchase a home. My parents gifted me money so I could buy down my rate. \n\nIt\u2019s not looking down on your hard work.

His apology was too half-hearted", "Got it. IMHO, his comment isn\u2019t necessarily condescending/patronizing. I don\u2019t get a sense of him looking down on or asserting superiority over you. His comments are definitely showing his assumptions/biases based on age. (I\u2019m not sure about based on sex.) Granted, maybe tone or body language conveyed more negativity that doesn\u2019t come through the phrasing alone. Based on just the wording, though, I don\u2019t read/hear condescension. \n\nThat said, his remark upset you and its good you spoke up. In the end, he didn\u2019t need to make any comments about how you afforded your home. He could simply congratulate or be happy for you that you have a lovely home. I do wonder if things would\u2019ve evolved differently if you hadn\u2019t called him condescending/patronizing and instead said his words felt that way to you  (I.e. label the language versus him). I think the natural inclination to being labeled something negative is to try to explain or defend, which can create another issue. In addition, I think he could\u2019ve simply apologized and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to appear patronizing or condescending,\u201d and perhaps the situation would\u2019ve been squashed. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH.

You are loaded. You are really loaded. You are a 0.1 percenter. I get that don't lead with that on a date, but showing the house demonstartes that you came from money or you made an absurd amount quickly.\n\nLet me re-headline your question: I earn so much money that people older than me with established jobs just cannot get how wealthy I am.
