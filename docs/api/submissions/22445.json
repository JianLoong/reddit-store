He's generally a cool guy who seems nonjudgmental.\n\nYesterday night he came over to my place for the first time. I live in a single-family home that I bought earlier this year. We're in a HCOL area and the house was a little over $1 million. I work hard in my career and have a high-paying job (which Zack knows about), but I come from a poor family and grew up near the poverty line.\n\nZack works at a non-profit and is not as financially privileged as me, which I do not care about at all. But he stayed the night and this morning he made a comment that just left a bad taste in my mouth. His comment implied that my parents must have helped me buy the house.\n\nIt felt incredibly condescending and patronizing and I also feel like he would not have said/thought this if I were older or if I were a man. His comment upset me and I called him out for being condescending/patronizing. He briefly apologized (\"oh sorry\") and tried to justify it with saying that he thought there were other signs I came from a rich family, like having an attended an elite college and driving a car my parents gave me (a 6 year old Honda Accord).\n\nI was still upset and he ended up leaving. Later today he texted me saying he had apologized for his assumption and that it wasn't cool that I called him condescending and patronizing for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole for this? In my opinion, if he wasn't a condescending and patronizing person, then he wouldn't have made that assumption in the first place? I feel like the natural thinking would have been that I worked hard and did it myself, not that I must have had my rich parents help me.\n\nedit: for more context on what he said, we were talking about how the city is so expensive to live in and he said \"it's cool how you were able to buy this place, it's awesome when family can help\"", "created_utc": 1689558530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151oapv/aita_for_accusing_the_guy_im_seeing_of_being/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jake isn't being condescending, he's being insecure and probably jealous because you have made sound financial decisions and worked hard to get where you are. This is compounded by the age difference.\n\nHis way of coping is to imply your parents contributed significantly to your financial success. This would relieve him of his self-imposed burden of being a 'failure' when compared to you.\n\nThe red flag here is when you called him on it, he doubled down with the elite college BS.

He made a significant and false assumption, based on which you pointed out he was being condescending.\n\nI suspect he's insecure bc despite being younger and female, you're more financially stable than he is.  In his mind it's better if you didn't earn it yourself, bc then he's not really losing to you, since you didn't actually earn it (not that financial worth is actual worth).  \n\nIf it were me, I'd be back on Hinge.", "If he said that word for word it is rude, but if he apologized I'd look past it as a one off mistake.

I'm not questioning your belief that it was misogyny.

He is scratching around to get info which he can then manipulate you with , like \u201c well can you just pay for this and this because I did not get the luxury of my parents not paying for my accommodation\u201d. People like this think they are smarter than you but you got lucky because your parents paid for your house - or any other excuse they can think of because you have worked harder than them. Honestly I could write a thesis on this because I knew someone who did this to two different women. The fact he accused you of calling him condescending / playing a victim is clear sign of his manipulative ways . I love these non judgements  types, they do not judge as long as you are lower on the pecking order than them, if you have something they want well then it\u2019s on and you are accused of all sorts.", "To be clear, who the heck even cares if your parents helped you or not?  His assumption either demeans your ability to fund your life or implies that accepting help makes you somehow less than him.

This is a foundation of good relationships. And his reaction (defensiveness and manipulation) is a red flag. He can't be trusted to act like an adult in an adult conversation.", "NTA.

I don't know where you are, but here in Aus the truth is most people can't afford a house without family help - so its an assumption that has now become ubiquitous........sadly.  There are a lot of stories about the 'bank of mum and dad' down here.\n\nThere is also a lot of evidence that there is a pay gap, and women have historically earned less - even for the same job - so for a woman to buy a $1mil house by themselves, they either need a really big salary at a young-ish age to even qualify for the mortgage, or they had help from family.  Given the widely held assumptions about salary etc, it's not wrong to assume you had help.  Clearly he doesn't know much about your background yet.\n\nTBH, I would assume your family helped you as well, and I am not a man - its just the world we live in where I am........it's possible he didn't mean it to be condescending at all.......this early in the relationship every word is being parsed for signs of 'red' or 'green'...\n\nedit - typo", "NTA \nHe is though.

Like Zach I am an elder millennial and as a generation we have been f*cked in the ass financially.\n\nDid he mean anything by it\u2026no clue. You need to look at any other comments he might make to see if there is a pattern of insecure behavior. If so, dump his ass with a quickness. \n\nBut taking this specific comment by itself, I can see why he made it. Working hard and/or working in a lucrative field does not mean that you\u2019ll necessarily be able to afford a home where you live. For many of us we DID and still DO need our parents help to purchase a home. My parents gifted me money so I could buy down my rate. \n\nIt\u2019s not looking down on your hard work. It\u2019s a statement of realizing that capitalism has us all by the short and curlies and \nwe have to do what we can to make it through.

His apology was too half-hearted", "Got it. IMHO, his comment isn\u2019t necessarily condescending/patronizing. I don\u2019t get a sense of him looking down on or asserting superiority over you. His comments are definitely showing his assumptions/biases based on age. (I\u2019m not sure about based on sex.) Granted, maybe tone or body language conveyed more negativity that doesn\u2019t come through the phrasing alone. Based on just the wording, though, I don\u2019t read/hear condescension. \n\nThat said, his remark upset you and its good you spoke up. In the end, he didn\u2019t need to make any comments about how you afforded your home. He could simply congratulate or be happy for you that you have a lovely home. I do wonder if things would\u2019ve evolved differently if you hadn\u2019t called him condescending/patronizing and instead said his words felt that way to you  (I.e. label the language versus him). I think the natural inclination to being labeled something negative is to try to explain or defend, which can create another issue. In addition, I think he could\u2019ve simply apologized and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to appear patronizing or condescending,\u201d and perhaps the situation would\u2019ve been squashed. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH.
