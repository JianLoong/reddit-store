He's truly such a gem and I am the luckiest person to share to life with him. I'd never want to hurt him in any way. \n\nRecently, however, he's developed something called tonsil stones. If you've never heard of it, consider yourself VERY LUCKY! this is a curse in every way.\n\nHis breath reeks like a mixture of ass and death. I swear it's the most foul thing imaginable. Lately, when he comes home I shudder because I know I'll have to endure the heinous odor.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, he's trying hard to fix this. He brushes his teeth at least 6x per day... But that only works for 10 minutes before the stench comes back\n\nWe've been to both his PCP and an ENT but they both just told him to gargle with a special mouthwash and poke the stones out manually. None of them seem to have taken us seriously.\n\nThis is taking a tremendous toll on our marriage... Sex has been off the table for months because the odor is such a lady boner killer.\n\nI stopped wanting to go out with him because anyone we meet would associate his stench with me. We even sleep in separate beds now because the smell comes out through his NOSE TOO, while he's asleep.\n\nI'm developing anxiety and sometimes the smell quite literally takes my breath away, it is just so shockingly strong and pungent. I feel like the wind knocked out of me sometimes when he opens his mouth especially first thing in the morning. \n\nHe's so embarrassed, but works in the hospital so has been wearing masks which helps at work... But doesn't help at home (interestingly, covid made his sense of smell wonky, so he doesn't get bothered by it as much. It's almost like his smell is dulled?) \n\nThis has been a halitotic hell for me and it's getting worse. The only thing that might help at this point is to get his tonsils removed but...\n\nHe's afraid of surgery (which I totally understand) and it is painful too.\n\nBut I can't go on this way. Yesterday he was chatting with me while doing the dishes with his back facing me and I STILL smelled his breath. It's just THAT strong. It's a halo of smelliness no matter what. \n\nI hate to sound dramatic but I get really overwhelmed and tearful from this. We are lacking intimacy.. He comes close and I jump away... I just want to snuggle with him but even if he masks up, the smell comes through a bit and just ruins the mood. For his birthday I made him breakfast in bed but made an excuse not to be there when he woke up just so I wouldn't have to endure the smell of death/ass that would fill the room when he opened his mouth. \n\nMy parents know something is off with me, and have suggested therapy (couples and individual). I'm considering it, but i honestly don't know how a therapist can help with this issue. \n\n\nI don't want to discuss this with anyone we know since I don't want to shame my husband, so please dear Redditors, let me know if I would be TA for suggesting (possibly demanding) something as drastic as surgery. Do i/we need therapy? \n\nEdit:\nThanks for the responses and ideas. I want to stress that my husband hasn't been neglectful about oral hygiene. In fact he's become almost neurotic about it due to this issue. We've tried poking the stones out with those syringe tools, and he used the prescribed mouthwash to gargle with. But no matter how much gargling or poking the stones, we can't reach them all, and they just come back anyways. He's also started eating cleaner in the hopes that less junk food will help. But that isn't working. \n\n He feels terrible, always apologizing... And this makes me feel worse because I know he's trying and feels so bad already. It's just causing me so much anxiety. \n\nI don't want to kiss him and when he offers to go down on me I don't want to even think of that mouth near my lady bits.", "created_utc": 1682216146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vs15b/wibta_for_making_an_ultimatum_on_my_husbands/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's really not that bad of a surgery despite the horror stories, so it might be in his best interest to suck it up and go under.", "I know that mine went almost completely away when I finally got my post nasal drip / allergies under control. No constant drip down the back of my throat, no more stones. Clear sinuses, clear tonsils. I\u2019m on year-round allergy meds and a nasal spray. Does he have allergies?  Recurring sinus infections? Might be worth a look at prior to taking out his tonsils.  \n\nAnd yes, that smell is horrific. I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA. Get another ENT and ask them to take the tonsils out. This is not just a temporary inconvenience it\u2019s affecting everyone\u2019s physical and mental health.", "NTA. it sounds like it\u2019s affecting your quality of life.", "NTA. It\u2019s surgery time.", "NTA--this may be dumb, but have you had him try talking to a dentist? Just for another opinion. (There was an episode of Ted Lasso in which a medication made the niece's breath embarrassingly bad and the dentist explained the bacteria in her mouth had been unbalanced. Just made me wonder if another oral oriented professional may be able to think about it from another perspective.)", "NTA and I feel for the both of you!  He's got to be soooo embarrassed!  If it were me and it was that bad for my family, I wouldn't be upset if my husband politely asked me to get surgery. I would probably hold off because I'm scared, but quality of life means something", "If tonsil stones are what I am thinking of... if left unchecked, the bad breath may just be the first big problem he deals with. The same bacteria that causes them can cause tooth decay, among other dental problems. And since our society sees teeth as luxury bones, any kind of dental risk comes with the threat of a hefty price tag.\n\nTBH, surgery doesn't really seem all that drastic when the alternative is a lifetime of extreme dental hygiene--including literally poking stones out of your own tonsils. If there was some other treatment available, I would get the hesitation toward surgery. A lot of times, \"elective\" surgeries like this have conservative treatment options that people can do to reduce or eliminate symptoms. But that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHave you discussed the fact that this could be the new normal for the rest of his life? How many hours does he spend brushing his teeth and poking out tonsil stones? Has it improved even a little bit over time? Or has it gotten worse?\n\nNTA for wanting a solution to a problem that effects you both, even if the solution is surgery.", "NTA. Just tell him to stop being so ridiculous and get his tonsils out. I had mine out as an adult too. It\u2019s really not a big deal. This is a totally fair dealbreaker. You can\u2019t even sleep in the same room or have sex with your spouse. And there\u2019s an easy solution, he just needs to go have it done.", "I know there are tools and even a specific type of waterpic for helping remove them, if he doesn't want his tonsils removed (which doesn't guarantee 0 stones) and was pretty painful as an adult. I would suggest he has to use the stone removal tools and do the gargle with the special mouth wash. I'd even say \"babe, can you go see if you can get some of the stones out, your breath is overwhelming right now.\"", "NTA\nHoly moly, I got the surgery at 16. There are worse experiences that getting your tonsils clipped. Sure it did hurt afterwards but it's just for a few days and eating no spicey food for about 10 days.\nThe smell is affecting you relationship on both sides and there is a simple solution for it. \nHe needs to get the surgery.", "NTA. I get why this isn\u2019t working for you and even though it\u2019s not your husbands fault he does have to try to fix this.\n\nInfo: does your husband smoke? It happens more often to smokers. If he does and he quits, that would help a lot.", "He can request to have them removed. Used to get tonsil stones in HS due to anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD which meant that I was not the best brushed, but I became one, however they would come any time I was remotely worn down. So I requested a referral for a specialist when I was 18, had the tonsils removed. Obviously that means I can\u2019t have tonsil stones every time I get over stressed", "NTA - People with bad breath are completely oblivious to how bad their own breath is. He probably  doesn't think it's that bad and thinks you're making a big deal out of it. \n\nIf you *really* want him to actually take some action, have someone else point out his bad breath to him. \n\nThen he will realize it's not you blowing this up or nagging him for no reason, but it's actually that bad.", "NTA but have you looked into the possibility of diabetes? Your situation sounds similar to my father's breath when his sugar is out of control.", "Have him cut out dairy. And the only real treatment is to manually remove them (try a q-tip) and use the mouthwash.

Usually it happens as kids (mine were removed).

A few suggestion: water pick (on low) applied to tonsil works well. Do some research on diet for tonsil stones and experiment. It helps but you need to find a right mix.
