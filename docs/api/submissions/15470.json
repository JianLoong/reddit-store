Lately, when he comes home I shudder because I know I'll have to endure the heinous odor.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, he's trying hard to fix this. He brushes his teeth at least 6x per day... But that only works for 10 minutes before the stench comes back\n\nWe've been to both his PCP and an ENT but they both just told him to gargle with a special mouthwash and poke the stones out manually. None of them seem to have taken us seriously.\n\nThis is taking a tremendous toll on our marriage... Sex has been off the table for months because the odor is such a lady boner killer.\n\nI stopped wanting to go out with him because anyone we meet would associate his stench with me. We even sleep in separate beds now because the smell comes out through his NOSE TOO, while he's asleep.\n\nI'm developing anxiety and sometimes the smell quite literally takes my breath away, it is just so shockingly strong and pungent. I feel like the wind knocked out of me sometimes when he opens his mouth especially first thing in the morning. \n\nHe's so embarrassed, but works in the hospital so has been wearing masks which helps at work... But doesn't help at home (interestingly, covid made his sense of smell wonky, so he doesn't get bothered by it as much. It's almost like his smell is dulled?) \n\nThis has been a halitotic hell for me and it's getting worse. The only thing that might help at this point is to get his tonsils removed but...\n\nHe's afraid of surgery (which I totally understand) and it is painful too.\n\nBut I can't go on this way. Yesterday he was chatting with me while doing the dishes with his back facing me and I STILL smelled his breath. It's just THAT strong. It's a halo of smelliness no matter what. \n\nI hate to sound dramatic but I get really overwhelmed and tearful from this. We are lacking intimacy.. He comes close and I jump away... I just want to snuggle with him but even if he masks up, the smell comes through a bit and just ruins the mood. For his birthday I made him breakfast in bed but made an excuse not to be there when he woke up just so I wouldn't have to endure the smell of death/ass that would fill the room when he opened his mouth. \n\nMy parents know something is off with me, and have suggested therapy (couples and individual). I'm considering it, but i honestly don't know how a therapist can help with this issue. \n\n\nI don't want to discuss this with anyone we know since I don't want to shame my husband, so please dear Redditors, let me know if I would be TA for suggesting (possibly demanding) something as drastic as surgery. Do i/we need therapy? \n\nEdit:\nThanks for the responses and ideas. I want to stress that my husband hasn't been neglectful about oral hygiene. In fact he's become almost neurotic about it due to this issue. We've tried poking the stones out with those syringe tools, and he used the prescribed mouthwash to gargle with. But no matter how much gargling or poking the stones, we can't reach them all, and they just come back anyways. He's also started eating cleaner in the hopes that less junk food will help. But that isn't working. \n\n He feels terrible, always apologizing... And this makes me feel worse because I know he's trying and feels so bad already. It's just causing me so much anxiety. \n\nI don't want to kiss him and when he offers to go down on me I don't want to even think of that mouth near my lady bits.", "created_utc": 1682216146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vs15b/wibta_for_making_an_ultimatum_on_my_husbands/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would hope that, given how bad your husband's case is and the impact it is having on both of you, he shouldn't need an ultimatum, even if he's understandably apprehensive. Surely he can see that it is the only option. If he can't, if he is refusing to take this step for the sake of his physical and your mental health, then maybe he does need more persuasion.

He'll have to remove it sooner or later anyways, so I suggest ASAP is better.\n\nThat said, it's understandable that your husband is anxious/scared of getting a surgery. Do whatever it takes to make the anxiety as less as possible. Maybe consult a dentist like what other redditors are saying. Maybe get a friend or support that can help lead you guys through the fear and confusion.\n\nJust keep in mind that removing the tonsil stones is the ultimate goal (and the ultimate solution to all of these problems). However, the road to that goal can be as comfortable as however much your husband needs it.\n\nI suggest starting with seriously talking to him (calmly) about it. Start addressing his issues with surgery together, and problem-solve how it can be tackled. I hope the very best for both of you. Good luck!\n\nEdit: Don't make an ultimatum that can make him feel pressured. I suggest you having a calm conversation. But be assertive, rational, and logical about it.
