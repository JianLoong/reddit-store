I was a freshman when he was a senior. \n\nHe graduated in 2020, and I recently graduated this year. \n\nIt has long been my plan to go to law school, beginning when I was in high school and continuing until now. \n\nMy boyfriend was never under any delusions that I wanted anything different. I first told him on our first date. He helped me study for the LSAT. He read my personal statement. He held my hand while I sent off my application. He threw me a party when I got accepted! \n\nAnd then I graduated, and we moved in together in June. I started law school classes in August. \n\nHe has since been distancing himself from me, and I have been at a loss for why, until tonight. \n\nAfter pressing him, he said he was surprised and hurt that I still decided to start graduate school after we moved in together. He said he thought that our relationship should matter more. \n\nI was obviously confused, as before he had seemed nothing but supportive. I realize I probably have less time to spend with him now than I have previously in our relationship. I asked him if having more time dedicated to him in my schedule would make him feel better. \n\nHe said it was fun and cute seeing me have my goals, but figured that once we got serious my priorities would change. \n\nHe wants me to drop out so we can focus on our future together. He claims that if he means anything to me, I\u2019ll choose him over school. \n\nI love him, and I feel terrible that I have made him feel this way.

It seems like he wants a little woman at home to look after him.", "NTA - your goals are not \"cute\". He's trying to change who you are. A life together is not mutually exclusive with a career, especially in this economy people need two incomes to make a good future. I feel this is a huge red flag and if this persists you should leave.", "I hate being a red flagger, but you need to leave this fool.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a loser for thinking you should drop out of law school. Don't you dare give this guy another minute of your time.

Sorry to say, OP, but this man doesn't seem like he cares about you, but only what he wants.\n\nIf he loved YOU, he would support your dreams of becoming an attorney, and not worry about himself.

So many things to say, but right now I Just Can\u2019t. NTA", "NTA and your boyfriend's expectations of the relationship are unreasonable. He knew you were going to law school. Did he seriously think you were willing to throw your life and financial future away just to worship his sausage a bit? His insistance that you \"choose him\" over school, and his apparent belief that it's impossible to continue a relationship while in law school is an example of a false dichotomy. That's an intellectually dishonest argument you will see sometimes in litigation. What he really means is that he doesn't really support your ambitions if they involve anything but being his orbiting satellite.\n\nEdited to add: if you give in \"to make him happy\" pretty soon he'll find some other major sacrifice to demand. How much if yourself do you want to set on fire to appease this man's fragile ego?", "You are so NTA... if he really loved you, he would support you and your goals. It's not like you hid this  from him or sprung it on him last minute. You have your goals and he has his. Tomorrow if he decided he wanted to pursue something I'm sure you would support him to. A relationship is about supporting each other and compromise.. if he can't see it then leave.", ">He said it was fun and cute seeing me have my goals, but figured that once we got serious my priorities would change.\n\nWHOA. Serious red flags here.\n\nYou are NTA. Any man who thinks women having goals and ambitions is \"cute\" is definitely T A.  Move on with a clear conscience, he's not who you thought he was.", "NTA come on, the red flags here are glaringly obvious! He said you achieving one of your lifelong goals was \"cute\"? That sounds incredibly misogynistic. Which leads me to my next question. What exactly should you be focusing on?? Him? What does he want you to be doing instead?

BF sounds like a piece of work though. WTF was he thinking if his expectation was that you were going through the motions and weren't going to follow through. \n\nAssuming you continue (and I hope you do), being a lawyer can be a very time consuming job with irregular hours, and I am not seeing anything here that suggests BF will be happy with that long term.

They made their relationship work around her education and specifically planned the wedding to be after she graduated. Your BF knew you wanted to go to law school and never brought up he didn\u2019t want you to go and instead just expected you to change your mind. I think you might want to reconsider your relationship since your BF seems to think your life should revolve around him.", "Lol, what? He thought you studied for/took the LSAT and applied to law school for funsies? \n\nHow about this: if you mean anything to him, he\u2019d support your plans for your future. Ya know, like a normal, healthy partner. \n\nUnless he recently got into MRA (men\u2019s rights activists) podcasts, this was actually his plan all along. Some men go after successful and ambitious women and try to turn them into trad wives. Why they do this instead of just dating trad women is up for debate. Mostly it stems from a general hatred of women, which they may or may not recognize about themselves. \n\nRegardless, don\u2019t give up your dreams for a partner that doesn\u2019t support you.
