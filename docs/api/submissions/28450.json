It\u2019s extremely stressful, with long hours studying, writing, and even socializing as one of the best ways to get a job later on is to network and socialize. If your partner cannot handle you having to commit a huge portion of your life over the next 3 years to school and establishing your career, you need to ask yourself what you want more: law school and the legal profession, or your partner. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunately a very cold thing to say, but it\u2019s the honest and blunt truth. I know far too many people who I went to school with that broke up with long term partners because their partners couldn\u2019t handle them going to law school. I have friends that faced some serious stress on their relationships because of the demands. If you\u2019re intent on sticking with law school and don\u2019t want to give up on your relationship, you need to be honest with your partner that you need him to be understanding and supportive. Law school is hard enough dealing with classes, projects, papers, exams, the drama in your school, and sleeping enough. That\u2019s totally ignoring if you\u2019re also working.

Talk about this instance with your parents, his parents, and shared friends. Let\u2019s say you DO give up your dream(please do not), these same people will ask why, especially considering how hard you worked. \nI think this will give you a lot of perspective\u2026. You have some big decisions to make and having people in your corner will help. \nCan you imagine him venting to his family and friends that his girlfriend (not even wife) refuses to quit school to focus solely on him because your goals aren\u2019t fun and cute anymore?  Do you think they would validate his ideals? Based on what you said , it doesn\u2019t sound like it. What happened was not normal and reasonable for a healthy relationship. If he was expecting a housewife, a reasonable person would have communicated that before their partner started law school\u2026\nIf you do decide to stay with him, even just for now, speak to people about this, make an exit plan(even if that just means saving up to break a lease), and keep your eyes peeled for concerning behavior. And perhaps emotionally prepare yourself for the worst. I\u2019m sure this was already a soul crushing experience and it\u2019s a huge turning point in your relationship. \nThere is a lot of great advice in your comments, please do what is healthy for you and be kind to yourself.", "Just ask the BF to what are the goals that he expects OP to achieve in her life once she drops out. It will mostly likely be wife to him, mother to his children, cook for him, maid for him, nurse for his parents etc. So unless he has some official title like Baroness, countess, duchess or queen or is filthy rich and does not require you to do any household work, donot drop out. It is important to have options in life", "If I had read this earlier we would have yelled it in unison. \n\nI\u2019ll get you on jinx next time.", "Incredibly condescending!", "and fun! Don\u2019t forget fun.", "Yeah, that got me too. F that guy.", "Not look like. He better be Henry Cavill.\n\n(Edit) \n\nOn a serious note: \n\nOP, please don't sacrifice your dreams and future for this man. \n\n If your relationship survives this and he \"changes\" his mind about being cool with you going to law school, chances are he will actively work to sabotage your law school experience and success. It will start with small things like getting in the way of your study time, making you late for classes or making you miss classes altogether. And the reasons he comes up with might seem genuine at first. But by the time you start seeing through them or he stops putting in as much work in being underhanded, so much damage will have been done already. And God forbid you get paired with male classmates for any of the class projects, then the cheating accusations will start being leveled at you. \n\nAnd if even with all this, you still graduate from law school, he'll then take credit for your success, citing actual events like helping you prepare for lsats and then adding made-up ways proving how you couldn't have done this without him. And any time you disagree, he'll throw that in your face. \"After all I did for you\" and other versions like that, to make you fall in line.\n\nHe might even babytrap you and then guilt/shame you into dropping out of law school so that you can be a \"good mother\" to your kid.\n\nAlso, prepare to start fighting over chores. And your other contributions to the household. Law school will be blamed for everything. And the chores and other responsibilities will always be super urgent just when you need to do something for law school.\n\n\nAnd since his type seems to be women with (in your words) \"girl boss things\" tendencies, if you quit law school and \"choose him\", he'll eventually start looking down on you, comparing you to his ex-girlfriends or to other professionally successful women like them. He'll crush your spirit and then blame you for not being the \"woman that he fell in love with.\" And use that to justify his mistreatment of you, his cheating or his leaving you for some other woman. \n\nIn conclusion: There's no winning for you here. The only solution is ending this relationship. Because you are not the problem here, he is. \n\n\nAlso please note (response to OP's comment about bf's parents marching for women rights): People don't always embody their family's values. They might talk the talk because they have been around their family long enough to know all the catchphrases and all the right things to say. But it doesn't automatically mean that they buy into all that. His family might be liberal, he might act liberal. But it doesn't necessarily mean he is. Plus having liberal leanings doesn't spare you from also being deeply insecure and acting on those insecurities. I have seen self-proclaimed \"male feminists\" who proudly rocked \"I'm with her\" t-shirts turn around and do things to their female partners that made card-carrying Andrew Tate supporters look like saints. People can be misleading. They can support movements and then turn around and do things that don't align with the movements they claim to support. And we get so shocked when that happens. I'm sorry it's happening to you now. \n\nAll the best in law school and I hope your next partner is genuinely supportive of you and your dreams. \n\n( I had posted this edit as a separate comment)", "And sign over half his multi-million dollar trust fund to account for lowered income and guarantee the money upfront.", "Exactly I\u2019d rather go to law school then worry about dick", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
