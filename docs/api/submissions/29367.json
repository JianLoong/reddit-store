I lived with him for less than two years and he was in no way my parent in the time I lived under the same roof. He was my mom's husband and nothing more though he wanted to be more. He and I actually butted heads because he didn't understand my rejection of him taking on a father role when I don't remember the time I had with my dad. I was 2 when he died so I had 2 years with him but I don't remember any of it. Then 14 years growing up it was just mom and me.\n\nI don't think my mom's husband is a bad guy. Pushy and somewhat insecure and entitled, in that he feels like I should have leapt at the chance to have him be my \"new dad\" essentially. But he's good to my mom and he seems like a decent guy otherwise. Not someone I like or even care about really. But I learned to tolerate him for my mom because she did come alive after she met him. And I know from her family that she lost a lot of herself after dad died. She changed and they say after she met her husband, it's the closest she ever got to the old her. I respect that and do appreciate that to a degree. But he's not someone I personally see myself ever being close to.\n\nWhen I got engaged I did not give any thought to him taking on a role of father of the bride or anything. Mom and I talked about whether she would like to walk me down the aisle or do a mother/daughter dance but she's not comfortable with it (my mom is very introverted and shy). I decided walking with my fiance would be bets and we're skipping the parent/kid dance entirely. But my mom's husband was upset that he was not given consideration for some of this. He told me that. He suggested he could pay for the wedding and take the stress of my fiance and I and then he would take on the true father of the bride role. I turned down his idea. He was pushy again and we argued again. He ended up coming back a few days later with the request that I chose for him to walk me down the aisle or have a father/daughter dance. I said no. He told me it's his job to do something like that. I told him it's not. He said of course it is as my sole father figure. I told him he is not my father or my parent and does not get to make demands for my wedding.\n\nHe told me I never gave him a chance and I might as well tell him not to come since clearly he doesn't matter to me at all. I rolled my eyes at him and he told me I was disregarding him and his feelings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697898694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17d3vji/aita_for_telling_my_moms_husband_he_is_not_my/", "score": 1012, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dont have to follow traditions or cater to him. Just tell him that his role is to enjoy the day as a guest, and nothing else.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, this may be the best time to gently, kindly, but firmly reiterate that it's not that you don't want a relationship to him, but that he has wholly overstepped in trying to dictate the type of relationship you will have to each other. \n\nYou spent *fourteen years* as a single-parent family unit with your mother. That's an incredibly strong bond. It sounds like it was not always easy for your mum, and you are clearly very glad that she got the emotional support that she craved from having a partner when she met him. But unlike her, *you never felt like you were missing anything* all those years. Your life felt whole with one parent. \n\nHe met you when you were already in late adolescence, and you only ever lived in the same home for two years. There is no logical reason why you ever would have seen him as a parental figure. You were already well on your way to adulthood and had been lucky enough to have been raised in a household where your emotional needs were met by the parent you had.\n\n>He told me . . . I might as well tell him not to come since clearly he doesn't matter to me at all. \n\nThat's not true, and this is what you need to explain to him. He matters to you *as your mother's loving partner and the man who makes her happy*. You want him at your wedding *as a guest*, and more than even some other guests because he is your mother's husband and a great one at that. Of course he matters; he is important to her, and she is important to you. But no, he doesn't matter to you as a parental figure, because that simply isn't his place in your life or in the family. \n\n> he told me I was disregarding him and his feelings.\n\nHe doesn't get to have feelings about how you plan or execute your wedding. He isn't your parent and he never has been. He is your mother's husband, and you care about and appreciate him for loving her, and you, but this isn't his wedding, or his child's wedding, and he doesn't get a say. And frankly, it is selfish and bordering on inappropriately disruptive for him to keep pushing you about this. You haven't disrespected him, you have simply made clear the role he plays in your life. For him not to accept that is a him problem he can take up with a therapist. You are NTA.", "NTA.  Based on what you've shared, or makes no sense for him to think he'd actually be in a fatherly role.  You were practically grown when they got married.  \n\nHe's trying to manipulate you with money to get what HE wants.   You're perfectly within your rights to draw a boundary and decline.  \n\nWhat does your mom think about this?", "NTA. Even if he was your parent he isn't entitled to walk you down the ailse or a father daughter dance. These are all optional parts of a wedding that people choose to have. He never raised you. Marrying your mom and living in the same home as you for two years doesn't automatically entitle someone to the role of parent. It's ridiculous that an adult who is only in your life through marriage feels so entitled to play such an important role in your life. You did not choose him your mother did. Yet he seems to think you are obilgated to give him a significant role in your life simple because your mother married him. You aren't even required to give him a chance because again he was your mother's choose for a companion. Not yours. You owe him nothing.", "NTA\n\nDude is desperate to the point of trying to \"buy\" walking you down the aisle and a dance.  And then when you said no, he pouted.  That's about as insecure and pathetic as I've read on this forum.\n\nYou were 16 when you met him.  And never close.  Don't really get where he is coming from.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding, OP!  Walking down the aisle with your fianc\u00e9 sounds lovely.", "He thinks you\u2019re disregarding him and his feelings?  Me thinks that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s trying to do to you.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You were 16, he\u2019s not your father and you\u2019re not close with him. Trying to force his way into the marriage (with money) is a shitty thing to do. \nHe can have his romantic ideals of walking a daughter to the altar, but you\u2019re not a puppet.", "NTA\n\nYou don't really like or get on with your Mum's husband. Why would you even consider him for any roll in the wedding. I can't believe he tried to buy his way in by offering to pay for the wedding, that is really low.\n\nI think it is nice you asked your Mum to take part, and a bit sad she declined. \n\nYour Fianc\u00e9 walking with you is a nice touch.", "NTA. It's your wedding so your wishes should be respected. When I was a single mom I met a lot of the hero types who wanted to swoop in and save the day but it was for their own ego more than actually wanting to be a part of a family. Based on his response to you turning down his MULTIPLE requests for your wedding, he sounds just like the type. He needs therapy lol.", "NTA. In his eyes, you never \"gave him a chance,\" but that was only because you didn't actually want a new father figure. It's not like you wanted one but rejected him personally - you were practically grown. And, OP, have the exact wedding you want, but be nice to him. Make sure he knows his attendance is wanted. Take extra care to explain your point. He sounds nice, but there is simply no \"job opening\" for the role he wants.", "NTA. I am so curious what your mom thinks about his pushiness to fill that role for you. Like, does she not understand your feelings or what?\n\n\nPersonally, I would have a talk with him. Let him know politely, but firmly, that you have a dad, and yes he is no longer here, but he is the only person you will ever consider your father. Remind him that he came into your life when you were practically an adult, and at that point you had no need or desire for anyone to fill the dad role for you. Express that you appreciate how he has made your mom come alive again and the happiness he brings her, and that maybe one day your relationship could be better if he can accept that your relationship is not a parent-child one.", "NTA.  Your wedding, your decision.  He is being disrespectful and entitled.  Tell him you are not going to discuss this any further and if he brings it up you will hang up/leave the room, whatever and then follow through.  Tell your mom what is going on and the decision you have made.  I am sorry you are having to deal with this.", "NTA. Tell him he\u2019s your mothers \u201cplus one\u201d", "NTA. People need to accept that rejection is going to be likely when marrying a widow/widower. He\u2019s not entitled to it and being pushy isn\u2019t going to help his case either.", "NTA.  Do what you want, it's your wedding.  You don't owe this dude anything.", "Info \u2014 Have you spoken to your Mom about this? \n\neta \u2014 I meant about conversation with her husband", "NTA perhaps you could explain it to him something along the lines of,  did you instantly have fatherly feelings and love me like you raised me from the moment we met?  Of course not, love takes time we have not had enough time to develop a loving relationship. I do love that you have brightened my mothers life and I will always be grateful for that but the relationship between is cannot be forced.", "NTA. He was in your life for two years, then he remained in your mother's life, who was a part of your life. He tried to bribe you, and the he threw a tantrum and tried to manipulate you. He might as well have stamped his foot and screamed \"but I want it\".\n\nBy his own reasoning teachers have thousands of kids.", "\u201cMay as well not come to your wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat might make my mother sad, but it\u2019s your choice.\u201d", "NTA - he is being immature and he only offered the money because he thought that would entitle him to make demands. It was a very good decision to turn that down. It doesn\u2019t sound like he ever came to terms with not being a father figure to you but that is not your problem. I really don\u2019t understand the people who enter a child\u2019s life late in their childhood and expect to automatically and instantly be regarded as a parental figure. It doesn\u2019t work that way and forcing the issue just makes things so much worse.\n\nHis response about not coming to the wedding is just childish. I would just stick to your decisions and hopefully he will stop sulking in time for the wedding.", "NTA, I have a good friend who married a woman with a ready made family. 3 kids in this case. His attitude was that he wasn\u2019t their father, but their mother\u2019s husband. He didn\u2019t push for a relationship but stepped up when needed. Now they consider him their father. Another poster pointed out how your mother\u2019s husband also accepted you as part of his responsibility and took you to task about it. But the difference is in your case, your mother\u2019s husband tried to insist on it. My friend took the same responsibility, but didn\u2019t insist on it.", "NTA for not wanting him to participate in the wedding. It was fine to ask once and offer to help pay but he should've accepted the rejection and backed off.\n\nHe doesn't have to be your dad to be a family member you care about though. Have you ever tried to hang out with him and get to know him one on one? If you haven't given him a chance, your refusal to have a relationship with him is probably coming out in his pushiness over your wedding.", "NTA. Honestly just uninvite him and be done with it.", "NTA - sheesh. What does your mom see in him? \n\nHe sounds so freaking whiny that I'd tell him he's invited, but if he's gonna cause drama or be a sourpuss then he can stay home if he wants.", "NTA. You have right to decide who you wan't or don't want to be close to.", "Waaaaa waaaaa I\u2019m not getting what I want. I know. I\u2019ll try to buy it. Waaaa waaaaa she doesn\u2019t want my money. Waaaaaaa waaaaa why won\u2019t she let me be her dad?? Waaaaaa waaaaaa.", "Oh dear! He's approached being a step parent  all wrong. You let them get to know you as a friend, if they want, someone to speak to, if they want, to confide in, if they want... you see where this is going. It's up to the step child to dictate what they want. As a step parent  just show up and be supportive. And keep doing it. Take your time. It was quite quick with my youngest but eldest took 5 years. Now 10 years later and my sons are in their early 30s and at some point both have call me their other parent.  Even my husbands ex has and she bounces between accepting it and hating it. I cherish my relationship but it's on their terms.\nYour mums husband is all push and it backfired. A step parent never replaces a parent, even if the parent is rubbish and the step awesome.", "Good lord. She was 16 before he even met her mom. How does he equate that with \u201cbeing a father figure\u201d or raising her? He\u2019s got a huge ego on him.", "Tell him \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed but I\u2019ve got this!  I really hope you attend and I know you make my mom happy.\u201d  No drama. Help him save face.", "NTA\n\nYou've made a choice that you don't want that part of the wedding and that's your choice to make even if your father was around.\n\nIt's a father's job to be happy for you and support you on your wedding day.", "NTA. He's asking for something he hasn't earned and he's being exactly as pushy as you said he is capable of being. It's not on. I get why he's crestfallen about it but that's life when you have a stepchild. He needs to take it on the chin.", "\u201cYou never felt like you were missing anything.\u201d Brilliant sentence from a previous commenter, and it gives OP an opening to say, \u201cPlease respect that my mom, your wife, completely filled that role for you, so you aren\u2019t seeking to fill it now.

Sometimes people's feelings will be disregarded when they clash completely with those of a more relevant figure, i.e. you. It'd be all sorts of diplomatic if you did, but the fact is that as he entered the scene when you were basically about ready to exit the oven into adulthood he can't claim to have been part of the baking process really.\n\nIt's also kinda tacky to offer financial backing allegedly for charitable reasons when you're still ultimately doing it to buy your place into the important roles in the event.\n\nNTA, because it sounds like you've been pretty patient with the dude.", "NTA. He is though, for pushing emotional intimacy that you rejected, and for going nuclear (not wanting to come to the wedding) because you said \u201cno\u201d.", "I would not invite him, after his little tantrum. I'd give my mother an invitation with a +1. But that's me, and I tend towards pettiness.   \nNTA", "NTA. This is your wedding, not a role playing game. Your thought was your mom, who was uncomfortable with it. She didn't even mention him. You made the best choice for you and your fiance. He's pushing for a role that that is non-existent, and trying to be manipulative with money. How he feels is immaterial, it's how you feel that matters.", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure how so many people become adults while never learning how to like ...

It definitely doesn't need to be a thing you fake for your wedding.\n\n(My dad is alive and well, and I STILL didn't have him walk me down the aisle or do a dance with him.)\n\nIt would be fair for him to be a presence in your life that made it warmer, kinder wiser... A person you could call to ask questions... Some father energy... But you don't just step into shoes because you married someone with kids, ESPECIALLY those that are already grown.\n\nI loved the man my mom married when I was a teenager. I totally would have called him for advice and geeked out about whatever. But at no point, ever, did he push to be *my dad*, and if he had, it would have broken my trust. We build relationships based on who we are, showing up and connecting, not who we think someone should label us.", "NTA at all. The wedding is about the couple getting married, not his feelings. He can\u2019t expect to be treated like your dad when you were practically an adult when he came into the picture. He should be standing back proud of his wife\u2019s daughter.", "NTA. He's disregarding your feelings. He knows you don't consider him your dad.", "NTA sounds like he isnt doing this for you at all, sounds like its because he wants a child and the wedding experience as a father. Very selfish, dont let em its not his day- and dont let him pay for it either, he will just make you feel like you owe him", "NTA and he\u2019s being manipulative for laying the \u201eI might as well not come at all because I clearly don\u2019t matter to you\u201d guilt trip on you.\n\nGood for you standing your ground. If he tries it again make it clear that you don\u2019t have a father daughter relationship and whatever you do have is likely to be ruined if he continues to value his wants and needs over yours for your own dang wedding. Good luck op.", "He didn\u2019t raise you, he came into your life when you were a teen, just two years short of becoming a legal adult yourself. If he wanted a relationship with you then, he would have found a way to bond with you over one of your interests. He would have TRIED, and the responsibility would have been solely on him as the adult.\n\nNow that you\u2019re an adult yourself, and celebrating the milestone of getting married, he wants to role play as dad? Why? To what end? If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be curious about his true motivation. I\u2019d want to hear him articulate it. \n\n\u201cI missed out on being a father myself\u201d = this is about him.\n\n\u201cI want to share this moment with you, to show I care, etc\u201d = to late to try to \u201cbecome\u201d your step-dad, also about him.\n\n\u201cThis would be a nice gesture from YOU, to show you care about ME\u201d - whether it\u2019s about him wanting to look like Step-dad Of The Year or not, it\u2019s alllll about him. \n\nIn fact I can\u2019t think of a line of reasoning he may have that doesn\u2019t completely center his on feelings over yours. I would be tempted to insist he give you a compelling reason why YOU should want to do this, just to see him squirm.\n\nAnd I would point out that if you were a man, he wouldn\u2019t be asking to walk you down the aisle or dance with you, he\u2019d just be a guest.

It's your decision how the day goes . Not his .", "NTA - hopefully your stepdad can calm down a little before the wedding. I walked down the isle with my hubby too when we got married.

That being said, you're NTA, obviously, because whether you decided to have a relationship or not, whether you were purposely putting blockers in the way or not, whether you remember your biological father or not, that relationship of this man being your dad did not exist and you're essentially being asked to fake it for his comfort level or to make him feel good and that is not your job.  Your wedding is about you and if you wanted to leave an empty chair for your dad, that would be your right, if you wanted to walk yourself down the aisle, if you asked literally anyone (my intention has always been to ask my best friend to walk with me, not my dad and I do not look forward to that conversation at all) it would be your right to do so.

I lived with him for less than two years and he was in no way my parent in the time I lived under the same roof. He was my mom's husband and nothing more though he wanted to be more. He and I actually butted heads because he didn't understand my rejection of him taking on a father role when I don't remember the time I had with my dad. I was 2 when he died so I had 2 years with him but I don't remember any of it. Then 14 years growing up it was just mom and me.\n\nI don't think my mom's husband is a bad guy. Pushy and somewhat insecure and entitled, in that he feels like I should have leapt at the chance to have him be my \"new dad\" essentially. But he's good to my mom and he seems like a decent guy otherwise. Not someone I like or even care about really. But I learned to tolerate him for my mom because she did come alive after she met him. And I know from her family that she lost a lot of herself after dad died. She changed and they say after she met her husband, it's the closest she ever got to the old her. I respect that and do appreciate that to a degree. But he's not someone I personally see myself ever being close to.\n\nWhen I got engaged I did not give any thought to him taking on a role of father of the bride or anything. Mom and I talked about whether she would like to walk me down the aisle or do a mother/daughter dance but she's not comfortable with it (my mom is very introverted and shy). I decided walking with my fiance would be bets and we're skipping the parent/kid dance entirely. But my mom's husband was upset that he was not given consideration for some of this. He told me that. He suggested he could pay for the wedding and take the stress of my fiance and I and then he would take on the true father of the bride role. I turned down his idea. He was pushy again and we argued again. He ended up coming back a few days later with the request that I chose for him to walk me down the aisle or have a father/daughter dance. I said no. He told me it's his job to do something like that. I told him it's not. He said of course it is as my sole father figure. I told him he is not my father or my parent and does not get to make demands for my wedding.\n\nHe told me I never gave him a chance and I might as well tell him not to come since clearly he doesn't matter to me at all. I rolled my eyes at him and he told me I was disregarding him and his feelings.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I never lived with them, lived with mom briefly while they were first dating (my bio dad had just died suddenly and while he was an AH, I just needed to be home for awhile with my family). He was closer to my age than my moms age (GO MOM! lol) in fact but it was never weird. He was always just so DAD like but never pushy. He was just there being sweet and open and emotionally available and folded all of us \"kids\" (4, 2 were teenagers) in with his own (2 minors). He treated us all the same but never made demands or had expectations for our relationships. Maybe it was because he was already a dad, maybe it was just him, but it worked, we all loved him. \n\nHe and mom didnt marry for a really long time...but he still felt like a Dad always, although I only ever called him by his name, or a nickname (we all had many). When they did finally marry, i actually officiated for them. It was beautiful. When I had my kid, he became Papa Name, if I had married I WOULD have probably had him walk me, but he NEVER would have pushed or even asked because from day 1 he ALWAYS respected my right and my siblings rights to determine the boundaries of our individial relationships with him. He let us decide and we chose HIM. If he had been pushy and demanding and insistent and bossy, I know for a fact we never would have. But mom also never would have tolerated it because its wholly inappropriate. \n\nI share all that to illustrate that it is not living together for a certain length of time or age at meeting or force that makes a blended family, family. Its space and respect and allowing it to develop naturally, its BEING the parent without demanding to be recognized as anything more than an adult friend, all things your stepdad never did. My stepdads kids were much younger, lived with their mom full time and they never felt about mom the way we felt about their dad. Their choice, and one that while it hurt mom, she accepted, because it was THEIR choice. Exactly as this is your choice, and in your shoes, i would make the same, i dont deal with entitlement and pushing well. Your mom needs to nip this in the bud once and for all, she should have done it when you were 16, but its her job as YOUR parent and HIS wife to get him inline.

Why don't you give this guy a chance? Doesn't have to be by him having a special role at the wedding, but why don't you try to get to know him a little? Do you want your mother in your life at all, or are you happy to perhaps become estranged from her or for her to see you less because you treat her husband so poorly and she doesn't want to never bring him over?

He treated me well and although we weren't that close, I still cared about him and am happy he was in my life and that I was in his life. Had my parent been trying to keep me and my sibling from my 'fake' Opa or treated him badly, this would have affected me and my sibling negatively as well as really hurt my bio Oma.

Could you come up with a non-traditional role that shows your appreciation for him? Have you ever spent time with him one to one? You might find a shared hobby or interest of activity or personality trait or worldview or something that you can bond over/enjoy spending time together.\n\nAlso think of the future: If your mother were to become ill or maybe he becomes ill, the other person would become a carer and might require help from you (and other family).

Nothing in that says anything about *her* emotions, resentment or otherwise.\n\n\"They should have had therapy so they could all understand each other.\"\n\nDo we know they didn't have therapy? Either way, there's no reason to think therapy would have convinces her that she wanted a new dad.
