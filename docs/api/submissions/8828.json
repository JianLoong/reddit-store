He started using his laptop and then went out with his friends, then came back home when I was making supper. I asked him if he had homework and he said no. In the middle of the night he got into my room 3 times to get stuff to do his homework, and each time woke me up.

I've also told him to get anything he may need before he sleeps so he doesn't wake me up. So when I woke up today(I wake up at 5am to prepare breakfast for him and my dad), I had a really bad headache and I was upset with him. He got defensive, my mum defended him. Basically what I said was \"why would you wake me up so many times? I got no sleep because of that and now I'm sick\"(trying to translate, English is not my first language).

Sounds like the items he needs for school need to be kept in the lounge and not the bedroom.", "NTA but your brother should keep his school stuff in the lounge, you all have tight living conditions but there should be a secure place he can put his school supplies so that he can do his homework at his leisure and not bother you.  At the very least he should get his compute & any supplies he needs out of the room before you go to bed & can put them back before school.", "NTA. Purely because it sounds like no matter how much sleep you get you have to cook and clean for everyone else before you start your day? Idk if this is a cultural thing because you stated English isn\u2019t your first language, but why would you continuously disrupt someone with insomnia whom you also expect to cook your breakfast?", "NTA. Move his school stuff into the lounge.", "NTA. It's understandable that you would be upset and confront your brother for waking you up multiple times during the night. You have already tried to communicate with him about not getting into your room at night and have explained why it affects you. It's not fair that he is not considering your needs and causing you to lose sleep and experience migraines. Additionally, it's not right for your mother to dismiss your concerns and defend your brother without considering how it's impacting you. You have every right to express your frustration and request that your brother respect your sleep.", "A bit but that's more because everyone is in these types of situations. You did ask him before hand and more than enough time has passed to where he should know that if he'll need something for homework, then it would be better to have everything with him instead of constantly going in there.\n\nThis is easily fixed situation and the solution is something only your brother can do. Seeing how this is a repeating issue, bring this up with both parents and your brother. Discuss and try to find a solution so this won't happen again in the future. I hope everything gets resolved.", "Expecting peace and quiet to sleep is not unreasonable. Your brother is disorganized and is making it difficult. NTA.\n\nHow about making some rules? Like no entering your room after 11 pm unless emergency.", "NTA.  His school supplies need to go in the lounge and he needs to learn to make his own breakfast if you have a headache with his name on it.", "You got the bedroom, so you\u2019ll also have to deal with the inconvenience associated. NAH, except maybe your parents for not giving both kids an equal and private space - have they even considered walking off his space with curtains or some other temporary thing?", "NTA I recommend setting a boundary with your brother, something like \u201cAfter this time the door is locked and you can\u2019t come in anymore\u201d. He should also find another way to store his belongings, maybe a box or something he can keep under his bed. I understand how he would need to keep his clothes in your room since he changes in there, but that\u2019s about it", "NTA! I would suggest that on the mornings after he disturbs your sleep that you not fix breakfast, telling them that you're too tired from lack of sleep, but that obviously would backfire, considering what you already said in your post. I would also suggest waking your mom up every time your brother wakes you up so she can see how disruptive it is, except you'd likely get into trouble for that, too. Why is your mom being so inconsiderate of you? Does she feel guilty for not providing a separate bedroom for him so she is letting him get away with his antics? \nReally though, from now on, make a huge, giant deal of asking him what he needs from the bedroom before you go to bed. And make note of what things he comes in to get anyway, then start just putting them out there for him every night, just as a matter of course. Might help... Sorry you're having to deal with this!", "NAH. I understand your frustration, but your brother does not have a proper bedroom. That kind of sucks for him.

And it sounds like you are shouldering a large portion of cooking and cleaning.  I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s your culture?  And your moms defense of brother, sounds like she puts him on a pedestal? and you being a woman must serve? I bring this up bc if that\u2019s the case, brother will always be rich and you will always have to suck it up and deal with it.

If your bedroom door has a lock, tell him before you go to bed that you'll be locking the door, so get whatever he needs out of there because you're done being woken up in the middle of the night.  I might be ALLLL kinds of petty (ok....I am), but \"take a sleeping pill\" and \"don't wake up\" if he comes knocking.  If he has to wake your parents up because you're not opening the door, even better.  They need a little taste of your frustration.", "I\u2019m a bit curious on the age gap between you and your brother, are you older? NAH I think. It sounds like your brother has the far worse deal here though, considering he does not have his own private space in your home at all. I feel like this is the kind of the thing you will need to deal with as a trade-off for getting the room. I mean, would you be willing to swap with him? Because if not then that kind of shows who\u2019s getting screwed worse here.\n\nThat said, not sure why the things he needs to study are kept in your room in the first place, why can\u2019t he have a dedicated spot in the living room for his own things? It must suck that he\u2019s always forced to disturb others if he needs to access his belongings, that\u2019s not really fair to put that burden on him all the time. I can\u2019t imagine he would ever really be able to relax properly at home.", "NTA\n\nAre you in a position to move out?  You're 23 and considered an adult.  Your mom doesn't work to earn money and don't seem to work at home either.\n\nI'm not sure whether young women normally move out before they are married in your culture but it's a definite consideration if they do.  Especially if you have a job and can afford it.", "NTA. Did you tell your mom that he went out with his friends, lied about having homework, then sat around doing nothing during normal hours before he had \"no choice\" but to do it in the middle of the night?

The only time anyone else does any chores is if I'm not around (I bake part time, but even if I'm baking I still do all the chores, its only when I'm delayed by a delivery that anyone else does anything in the house. Or if I'm helping my dad at work). My mum is a sahm and does almost no housework.  Mind you my 16yo brother is the youngest  If I'm sick and sleep in/take an afternoon nap, she tells me off and says \"being sick is no excuse\". I also feel like my brother is mom's favourite and he can do no wrong. In this case, she blamed me for not making sure he'd done his homework. \"it's your responsibility to make sure he finishes his homework before he goes out\" were her words.", "Mum doesn't want anything else in the living room, that's why things stay in my room. Everything of his stays in my room, and I really don't mind having him in my room during the day, its only a big deal when I'm sleeping\n\nAs for our age gap, I'm 23f", "In our culture young women usually stay with their parents until they're married, unless if they move to a different city for school. However, I'm really considering moving out. \n\nUnfortunately I'm not in a position to move financially, the job market is horrible(official statistics say over 90% of the country is not formally employed). And even those who are employed cannot afford housing, most employees are paid about USD$150-180. So everyone just does their own thing, everyone has a \"hustle\". I started baking but its not yet ready to sustain me if I move out on my own. I am looking for a job though. If I move out, I'll also have to get my own furniture, our houses are just houses.", "My mom and I both asked him if he had done his homework, he said he had. He told her some lie about having to fix a diagram, but when I kept asking how a diagram took him 3 hours he fessed up. \n\nMy brother doesn't wake up because of noise or light, so I guess he can't relate. I, on the other hand, wake up if the light is turned on. I wake up if people are talking at normal volumes(so afternoon naps are also a no for me, the last time I tried to take a nap I woke up every 10 minutes). Sometimes I end up having to take energy drinks if I have to be up till something like 11.

You\u2019re expected to make his breakfast for him after he can\u2019t even be considerate of your sleep? It also sounds like they\u2019re well aware of your sleep issues since you\u2019ve tried medications\u2026 I was making my own breakfast by the age of 16 so I think it\u2019s time your brother learns to fend for himself if he\u2019s gonna be inconsiderate like this\u2026", "Dumb hot peppers in the eggs next time.", "Stop making his eggs.", "Sounds like your mum is the asshole.", "This sounds awful for your brother tbh.", "Sorry but your mom sound like the AH in this situation.

He bought these specifically cause they were very comfortable.\n\nNot sure how you deal with white noise, but this might be something you could test out if you have noise cancelling headphones (maybe even regular headphones would work cause they should still block out some sound). No idea what to do about the light though. Good luck.", "Thank you. Let me look into it. I'll try"]}
