At the very least he should get his compute & any supplies he needs out of the room before you go to bed & can put them back before school.", "NTA. Purely because it sounds like no matter how much sleep you get you have to cook and clean for everyone else before you start your day?

Move his school stuff into the lounge.", "NTA. It's understandable that you would be upset and confront your brother for waking you up multiple times during the night. You have already tried to communicate with him about not getting into your room at night and have explained why it affects you. It's not fair that he is not considering your needs and causing you to lose sleep and experience migraines. Additionally, it's not right for your mother to dismiss your concerns and defend your brother without considering how it's impacting you. You have every right to express your frustration and request that your brother respect your sleep.", "A bit but that's more because everyone is in these types of situations. You did ask him before hand and more than enough time has passed to where he should know that if he'll need something for homework, then it would be better to have everything with him instead of constantly going in there.\n\nThis is easily fixed situation and the solution is something only your brother can do. Seeing how this is a repeating issue, bring this up with both parents and your brother. Discuss and try to find a solution so this won't happen again in the future.

I would suggest that on the mornings after he disturbs your sleep that you not fix breakfast, telling them that you're too tired from lack of sleep, but that obviously would backfire, considering what you already said in your post. I would also suggest waking your mom up every time your brother wakes you up so she can see how disruptive it is, except you'd likely get into trouble for that, too. Why is your mom being so inconsiderate of you? Does she feel guilty for not providing a separate bedroom for him so she is letting him get away with his antics? \nReally though, from now on, make a huge, giant deal of asking him what he needs from the bedroom before you go to bed. And make note of what things he comes in to get anyway, then start just putting them out there for him every night, just as a matter of course. Might help... Sorry you're having to deal with this!", "NAH. I understand your frustration, but your brother does not have a proper bedroom. That kind of sucks for him.

Because if not then that kind of shows who\u2019s getting screwed worse here.\n\nThat said, not sure why the things he needs to study are kept in your room in the first place, why can\u2019t he have a dedicated spot in the living room for his own things? It must suck that he\u2019s always forced to disturb others if he needs to access his belongings, that\u2019s not really fair to put that burden on him all the time.

I mean, a lot has happened that pushed me to decide to move out, but the last straw was about a week ago\n\nMy mum and brother went to my grandma's, and I needed to bake a clients cake for the next day(I bake part time), as well as making dinner and cleaning up. So I told her I'd be coming to grandma's about 3 hours later. About an hour after she left, I started feeling sick. Fever, headache, nausea. I didn't realize I was coming down with a cold. So I texted her and told her I may come later than expected, then she called me and basically demanded I come immediately. I then said, okay, let me take paracetamol and give it maybe 30 minutes and see how I'd be feeling. I fell asleep, them woke up 4 hours later, so I couldn't go to grandma's. She called me, very upset that I hadn't done anything, and complained about how she would have to do everything when she got home, I didn't say anything to her.

By the time she got home everything was basically done, I think dinner was like 10 minutes from being done. \n\nThe next day, I was out all day. I went to my dad's work so he could take a day off(at her request, she's always complaining that they never spend time together). I got home to a dirty house, supper wasn't done, the dishes weren't done. The next day it was like I had to start where I'd left off 2 days earlier, only that there was a lot more work. Her excuse, \"I wanted to spend time with your dad\". That was just the final straw, and I'm hoping to move out by end of march.", "Wow, your mom is a piece of work. I'm cheering you on to get out there as soon as you can- you life will likely be a *lot* less stressful. You'll probably still have to deal with some of her crap, unless you go low contact or cut her off. I know that's hard to do, especially with your parents, but it can sometimes be necessary.
