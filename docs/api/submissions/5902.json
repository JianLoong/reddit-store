But you did. You\u2019re a huge asshole. This is coming from a porcelain princess who is a constant sunscreen reapplier. Again, you\u2019re a huge asshole.", "YTA", "YTA, how rude and selfish of you. Do you really care about your boyfriend **at all?**", "YTA why just why?", "YTA you didn\u2019t think it was worth him avoiding that burn?", "YTA. Your reasoning is illogical. Do you even care about your bf?", "If course YTA \n\nWould you also deny a person water if they were thirsty?\n\nNeither your logic nor your attitude are working in your favor.", "YTA. I know others have said it, but how is sunscreen personal? I work at a residential school and during the summer we\u2019re outside everyday. You better believe I\u2019m going down the line applying the exact same sunscreen to every little body. It\u2019s even supplied by the school, since it would be seen as a health hazard to be out in the Sun all day without it.", "YTA and I\u2019m supposed to believe you like this guy? And it doesn\u2019t bother you that he was burning? Poor guy. Perhaps one day you could be on fire and he can return the favor by not throwing his personal blanket on you to smother the flames.", "WTF did I just read? \n\n\"My parents are dermatologists so I know how important skin care is. My BF forgot his sunscreen so he can get wrecked and enjoy his skin cancer.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nSo, your entire family has pleaded for him to use sunscreen and when he decides that he will - you say no?  Enjoy single life.", "YTA", "How old are you?! \n\nYTA and I suspect you get it from your mom.", "YTA \n\nYour mum actually was happy for your boyfriend to be taught a lesson by being burnt? An actual dermatologist? She\u2019s an AH too. \n\nYour Dad is right. You\u2019re an AH. \n\nYou told him to wear a hoodie to minimise sunburn instead of just sharing the fucking sunscreen you had right there which is what it\u2019s for!\n\nSure he should have brought his own. He didn\u2019t. It costs nothing to be kind. You were unkind.", "Wtf?! YTA\n\nHe could have prevented his burns but you wouldn't let him based upon your own set of rules and stipulations. You suck.", "Lol, YTA big time, do you have sadistic tendencies?", "What did I just read?\n\nDo you like your BF? In any way?\n\nYTA. What an oddly specific and terrible way to go about an otherwise totally normal happenstance.", "Meanwhile, I practically pin my husband down to smother him with sunscreen when it's sunny out....so he doesn't get a painful burn.", "YTA. Grow up. If you loved him, you wouldn\u2019t let him burn. Maybe he cares about you enough to start making an effort\u2026 and for some stubborn men, admitting \u201cdefeat\u201d is tough. And what do you do? Ruin it for him! Go back to the playground and don\u2019t share your crayons with the other kids.", "I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll soon be single.", "R u serious? Ur seriously posting About this dumb shit? Just give him the freaking sunscreen jesus christ these are the type of posts that make me wonder if were in a simulation", "Your parents are dermatologists but your writing indicates you think only sunny days cause sunburns. Regardless, YTA", "YTA - first, sunscreen isn\u2019t a personal thing.  That is just weird.  You should always share sunscreen with friends/family that ask.  Second, who cares if he diligently wears sunscreen every day?   If your parents are Indeed dermatologists, as you claim, then you would know that every burn increases your odds of getting skin cancer.  He asked because he knew it was a good idea to use it even if he forgot to bring his own.", "YTA. What is wrong with you? Seriously. Or is this a joke post? No one can be like this.", "Yikes gurl- \n\nYTA who tf cares if your family are dermatologists if anything that should ENCOURAGE you to share your sunscreen. Yet you're being petty because he's a man who doesn't think like a women when it comes to skincare.", "YTA- I would share sunscreen with a literal stranger. I would definitely share it with my boyfriend or a friend. You refused to share and let your boyfriend get injured with a sunburn. That\u2019s so selfish.", "YTA. You are definitely TA. I offer random strangers at the park sunscreen, and you are intentionally refusing to help someone you claim to love? Knowing that you are directly contributing to cancer and pain? What is wrong with you?", "YTA. Maaaaate. Just no. \n\nIf you knew a car backing out and your BF was standing behind it with headphones in, would you leave him there to get hurt, too? \n\nBut even so, you've very encouraging him to improve his sun safety, he actually wants to follow in your footsteps for once, and now you're going to act petty even though you knew it was going to hurt him. That's not on.", "YTA - if sunscreen is so personal, I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t keep a spare bottle to share with others.  Very petty of you, OP.\n\nETA- Grammar", "YTA. And quite thick to go with it.", "\"Wear a hoodie, heatstroke is better than sunburn!\"\n\nYTA. Sunscreen can help protect against skin cancer. And sunburns, which hurt. Your dad, THE DERMATOLOGIST YOU LISTEN TO FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, is right.", ">I refused to share since it wouldn\u2019t make sense to take care of your skin just once\n\n>Long story short, he got sunburns\n\nHe wasn't trying to establish a skincare routine, he wanted to prevent sunburn. You may not agree with it but it did actually make perfect sense. YTA", "YTA. Why so selfish?", "YTA. Do you even like him?", "YTA lmao what the hell", "I'm going to go against the grain and perhaps get a lot of hate here, but I would say no necessarily the asshole.\n\nHe's a big boy and he should know if he's going to the beach he will need to bring sunscreen or at least this time *in advanced* before heading to the beach ask his boyfriend if it would be ok for him to use his as he hasn't got any today. Heck he could have stopped at the shops on the way to the beach and get one. How hard is that?\n\nYes, OP could have said yes this time 'but next time make sure you remember you will meed sunscreen when we go to the beach' or something like that. But he's under no obligation to be responsible for the grown-up responsibilities while boyfriend just gets ready for the fun. I think in this particular case it seems that he needs to learn a lesson and put on his big boy pants, particularly for something as simple and common sense as this. It's not that hard. \n\nAlso OP's parents are absolute legends (where they obviously dont need to) and boyfriend should be very thankful for that. \n\nI agree with OP and OP's mum. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I got the genders wrong in my original post, my bad.
