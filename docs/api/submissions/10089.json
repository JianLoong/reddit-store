I am legally required to go though \\*that\\* line because I am A UK CITIZEN, unlike everyone else here.\" and well lay on the ham thick about legality because that seems the only real ticket with power tripping teachers \\*eyeroll\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWIBTA: No  \nAgain, No. Hyperbole here: but like if they told you to go kill a puppy and then tried to punish you for not, I wouldn't accept the punishment either. \n\nHowever if you don't think your parents will back you (because well we know enough parents on this board throw their kids under worse buses) I would weigh whether you think the school will be able to extract punishment on you later.", "NTA talk to your parents and family members can come to the hotel to pick you up. Your parents can talk to the teacher in charge of the trip explain you were following the law of the land based on experience and being a British citizen and get the teacher in charge to stop the grounding as it\u2019s unreasonable and would\u2019ve got you and that teacher in trouble and/or delay the groups progress to enter the country so you can see your family or get your family to pick you up from the hotel with parental consent.", "NTA.

You knew which line you had to be in, and your teacher didn't trust you.  At the same time, it's HARD being in charge of a bunch of kids on a trip in a foreign country, the fear of letting one of the kids out of your sight and never seeing them again is real.  So I can see the teacher's perspective, too, that the more important thing was to keep everyone together as you moved through customs.\n\nNAH for what already happened.  I think you should ask to speak with the teacher, explain your reasoning for going in the other line (that is, your personal experience) but then apologize for disobeying them and see if you can get your free day back.", "NAH, your teacher was just ignorant of the rules of the country, so I wouldn\u2019t call her an AH. Explain to her what happened last time you did that. And that you weren\u2019t trying to be rebellious or disrespectful. Hopefully she\u2019ll be understanding and give you your free day back.

Who will look more foolish, you or your teacher?", "Did you bother to explain this BEFORE arriving at the airport? Or did you spring \"hey,  I'm going my own way,  I'm gonna be out of your eyesight in an international airport where - despite my age and citizenship - you are responsible for my safety and if anything happens to me,  your ass is grass.\"?\n\nAnd as for going to see relatives,  again have you cleared it with the chaperones or do you somehow think it's OK to go without telling them where you will be or where you are going?\n\nIf the answer to that is any form of \"no,  I did not bother to inform my teachers/chaperones of my plans,  despite the fact that not doing so could risk their jobs?\" then YTA. \n\nAnd you are double the asshole for thinking sneaking out is a reasonable or mature decision or course of action. \n\nBelieve it or not, your teacher's primary concern is keeping you safe and springing unexpected actions or information on them is not conducive to building trust or confidence in your decision making abilities. \n\nIf you want your teachers to trust you,  tell them ahead of time and be willing to negotiate and compromise,  not go off on whatever you want because,  again despite your age and citizenship,  they are responsible for your safety and that is their number one concern. \n\nSo in case I wasn't clear,   YTA", "ESH.\n\nThe passport control officers can cope if one British passport comes through in a line of American kids. It happens often enough. It's not actually a law.\n\nIf you were a younger kid, I'd be saying you were TA more strongly, but you're 18. You're an adult, and can cope with \"meet us at baggage claim\". And yeah, your teacher is an AH for not engaging with the idea that not everyone fits in to her parochial American-centric worldview. But you're an AH for not making it clear to her in advance that you had a UK passport, and so would need to go through a different line and would reconnect with the group at baggage claim. Nobody's brain works very well after a transatlantic flight - you're an AH for putting her on the spot the way you did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
