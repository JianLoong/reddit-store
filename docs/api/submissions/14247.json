He\u2019s not blind and he\u2019s too young to clearly communicate how much he can and can\u2019t see. We do believe and by my sister, Amanda\u2019s (34F) admission that he can see a great deal. Some stuff just not as much.\n\nThe issue is, Amanda has the habit of not disciplining Elliot with the excuse that he has a condition. Yet, she also admits that he has no other delays. He\u2019s a very clever and smart little boy. He is old enough and cognitively ready to start learning boundaries. Amanda doesn\u2019t enforce them. Elliot can be a very sweet little boy but it can be difficult when Amanda gets away with a lot.\n\nOne of Elliot\u2019s favorite activities is to climb up and down the stairs. Inside, outside, doesn\u2019t matter. This activity isn\u2019t a problem\u2026until other people need to go up or down and Elliot won\u2019t move so they can. Understandable, he\u2019s 2. But it\u2019s yet another thing my sister won\u2019t correct him on and won\u2019t make him stop. So, it turns into the other person waiting for him to move enough so they can. It\u2019s frustrating to say the least. Amanda is always there to supervise.\n\nElliot and Amanda came over today for a visit. We were outside with my younger daughter. Elliot was going up and down the steps with Amanda\u2019s supervision. My older daughter, \u201cSasha\u201d (14F) came onto the porch as she was going out. She said \u201cexcuse me\u201d and Amanda tried to get Elliot to move but he didn\u2019t want to, so he didn\u2019t. I got up to tell Amanda he needed to move, now. Before I could, Sasha scooped Elliot up and told him \u201cstop playing on the stairs, you\u2019re in the way\u201d. He kept demanding to be put down and she said no. She didn\u2019t until they were both off the steps.\n\nAmanda was pissed and said that Sasha had no right to move her son nor talk to him that way. He is disabled after all. Sasha said \u201chim being disabled is irrelevant. He understands fine\u201d. She then walked away. Amanda wanted me to call after her and scold her for the way she spoke to her and her son. I refused saying that she was right. Amanda took Elliot and left.\n\nOur mom says that Sasha is disrespectful and Amanda is calling her niece and myself ableist.

She needs to also learn boundaries.", "Edit: Misread initially. NTA. Leaving my comment as is except for initial judgment.\n\nUmm, I\u2019m going to say (e s h) and the eye condition likely has nothing to do with anything here. First off, he\u2019s 2. I\u2019m not an expert on toddlers but I\u2019ve got one and know a few, and I have to say that it\u2019s pretty common for them to \u201cspace\u201d out when asked something. I don\u2019t consider it to be misbehaving though (usually that is done with a mischievous smile/laugh or the grumpiest eyes you\u2019ve ever seen). Toddlers have a lot going on in their minds daily. Their minds are still developing, their feeling new emotions, they\u2019re still learning how to coordinate their body and mind, their learning a language, etc. Sometimes it becomes too much and they get overstimulated and just shut others out. They also seek self soothing or try to fulfill and sensory need (such as climbing). Maybe the eyesight is making this process even more overwhelming for him, but Idk. Again, I\u2019m no expert but this seems pretty normal, eye condition or not. \n\nSo, basically, nobody is at fault for the 2 year olds behavior (including the 2yr old). You were being too harsh on your sister, basically putting the weight on his perfectly normal actions on her parenting abilities. Also, your daughter (in my opinion) was a little harsh with the nephew. Your sister, on the other hand, overreacted and jumped to an ableist argument way too quickly.

I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 14 year old carrying my big robust 2 year old down narrow hazardous stairs(as you have described).", "I don't want to weigh in on this issue in the post overall because I don't think there is enough info about the tone. It really depends on how your daughter did it. If she was disciplining someone else's child without permission, that's not really cool, but if she was gently moving him out of the way for safety and there was no time/option to have the mother do it, then she was totally fine. But it seems like one of those cases where it probably seems different to everyone involved, so determining the AH won't really solve the problem. \n\nHowever, I did want to weigh in on your questions here. Younger teens often don't quite have the empathy developed yet to understand the feelings of much younger children (or adults, or their peers...honestly 13-14 is a very rough age. They go through so many changes that they have to be somewhat self focused), and when interacting with a young toddler, they can do things without thinking that can come off as frightening or even bullying to them. \n\nI have a 13 year old, a 14 year old, and a 2 year old. My 14 year old is actually great with my toddler, so there are definitely exceptions and your teen might be like that too, but my 13 year old and other teens in that age group that come around seem to have great difficulty seeing a 2 year old as an individual with feelings. How they would pick a toddler up in that situation would be to just scoop them up like picking up a box or other inanimate object, and even if they said what your daughter did, it would be mentioned after they had already lifted them up and more for the adults watching and not in a way the toddler would realize was directed towards them. Whereas an adult would be more likely to get down to eye level, tell the toddler why they needed to move, and then pick them up. Thereby correcting the behavior and showing them what's acceptable, while also respecting them as a person. It's a small nuance, but it makes a big difference (even if the toddler still doesn't like being moved!) with whether the toddler feels they are being taught something versus just having something done to them.\n\n13-14 year olds seem to struggle with this, just because of where they are at developmentally. If a toddler is treated often like an object rather than a person, it can cause them a lot of stress and feel like bullying, even though the teen never meant it that way. If it happens one time it isn't a big deal, but if it keeps happening, then it's an issue. I'm not sure if your daughter is like this, but the description of how she acted did remind me a lot of the teens I'm around that didn't initially think to take the time to communicate with my 2 year old before picking her up or hugging her, which while it wasn't meant harmfully, it obviously distressed her (I've since intervened and stopped them from doing that). I completely agree that a 2 year old shouldn't be playing on the stairs, but it's just important to explain things to them before physically moving them (unless it's catching them right before they fall or some other emergency, of course).", "Disabled child? He has a vision issue and he can do stair by feel how fucking ABLEIST of you. HIS MOM WAS BEHIND HIM SUPERVISING. Learn to fucking read people.", "The mother of the child could've at any point taken the child off the 14yr old if they was concerned bout them carrying the kid down the stairs. 14 yr old are perfectly capable of carrying a 2 yr old.
