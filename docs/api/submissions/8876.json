The note would be appropriate, but a conversation would be better.  I'm not sure if the \"gift\" of a roll of poop bags would be considered insulting, because it suggests that the reason she doesn't pick up after her dog is that she can't afford the bags.\n\nI would also say that if your only concern is being blamed for her dog's poop, then your concern is misplaced.  I am sure that there are plenty of neighbors who have witnessed you picking up after your dogs, and have also witnessed her not doing so.", "NTA. Maybe this person will take the hint if you do this. I would do it anonymously to start.", "Nah I don't think so because I'm very petty. There's two ways you can do this as I see it:\n\n- the nice way: you give it with a note with the bags that says something like \"hey, I noticed you might need some of these. Your neighbours would apreciate it you use them, thank you\" or something like that\n\n- or the evil way: you leave a note with the amount of money that you have to pay for a fine of not picking your dog's shit with the words \"just a reminder :)\"", "NTA - but perhaps handle it with some tact. Tell her you've recently come into some extra bags and thought, as a fellow dog owner, she may be able to use them. \n\nI find people don't typically respond well to accusations or demands. Maybe she'll take the hint. But then again - maybe this is my British avoidance of confrontation coming through.", "NTA and I think this is a subtle way to say \"clean your dogs shit\" without actually saying those words.  Basically, I would view this as step 1 if they don't start using the bags. Step 2 is telling them to pick their dog shit up. Step 3 is pick up the dog shit and give it back to that person on their doorstep.", "YWNBTA. If she can't pick up after her dogs she deserves the embarrassment.", "YWBTA if you did it that way. Might want to be a snoop and just stalk her to see when she's out walking her dog. Casually bump into her when walking your dogs and then whip out the roll and be like \"hey, I've noticed you sometimes run out of poop bags and I always carry a spare roll because I always forget to refill mine immediately! Here's a roll for those emergencies!\" That would seem more natural and less in your face. But if you don't care about being friendly, then do it your way! Very direct but might not land well with her. \n\nAt dog parks when the dogs are off leash and so many owners don't pick up dog shit, I've pretended to be helpful as if the owners didn't notice their dogs had taken a shit. I always point out where the shit is. If someone doesn't follow me, I know they are repeat offenders. Have had several people shrug and just keep walking away. Most people pick it up though some are obviously peeved LOL. As a dog owner, I want everyone to pick up their dog's shit.", "If you are ABSOLUTELY certain it is her dog leaving behind the piles, then no NTA.  She may be embarrassed but who gives af?  There are plenty who would pick up the crap with a shovel and drop it off on her doorstep.  NTA", "not in the slightest.    \nOur community has huge problems with people not picking up after their dogs, and I always get the side eye when our doggie does her business.   \nI'm tired of being painted with the same brush as the asshats who dont clean up after themselves.   \nNTA", "No you wouldn't bta, I hope. We did it. But for a different reason really. Our neighbor wasn't cleaning up the back yard behind her dog and hubby has a garden down there. We had poop bags and gave her a roll. Did it help? slightly. Did we feel better trying to keep things nicer, heck yeah.", "NTA. You say you've seen her do it. Why haven't you confronted her when you witnessed it? Leave the bags and the note. If that doesn't work, then pick up the poop if it's in your yard and drop it in her yard.", "NTA. But she'll get offended. People that don't clean up after their dogs. Don't like it pointed out.", "NTA\n\nI have a muscle disease that makes it impossible to bend and pick something up off the ground - so I use a pooper scooper. There are no excuses for leaving your dog's poop.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

BTW, as a dog owner who picks up after my dog, my biggest fear is someone will think I didn't pick up random piles near my home, so that line made me chuckle.
