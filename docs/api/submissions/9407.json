Chris\u2019s niece Emily (19F) also lives with here. Her home life was not very stable and she moved in with Chris right after her high school graduation and is now attending college in our area. \n\nIm a very organized person and I\u2019ve been cleaning out and reorganizing closets and the garage since I\u2019ve moved in. I don\u2019t touch Emily\u2019s things if it can be helped and I definitely don\u2019t go in her space. There\u2019s a little walk in pantry off the kitchen that Chris used as a general storage area and I\u2019ve been wanting to clean it out and use it as intended. \n\nI pulled everything out and sorted into 3 piles - keep, move, get rid of. \n\nOne of the things was a small box of craft paints and brushes. I checked to see if there was anything i could use in the box but besides a bag of popsicle sticks, nothing was salvageable. The brushes hadn\u2019t been washed so they were ruined and the paint was mostly dried out. So I put it in the toss pile. \n\nWhen Chris got home, I had him take a look over what I planned to get rid of and he gave me the okay. I piled the stuff headed for the trash next to the garage door to sort for the garbage in the morning. \n\nEmily came home and saw the pile. The paints were hers not Chris\u2019s moms. She got really, really angry with me for throwing her stuff out and yelled at me. Apparently she hates me. Hates my cat, hates the food I cook, hates my holidays, just dislikes everything about me. Im an idiot for not checking with her before throwing things out. I should move out. And etc. It was a lot to take in. \n\nI felt a little bad that I threw out her stuff but not too much, to be honest. None of it was usable and it wasn\u2019t high end art supplies, it was generic craft paint and cheap foam brushes. And after she finished screaming at me, I really didn\u2019t feel that bad at all anymore. She left to spend the night at her friends house. \n\nShe didn\u2019t take the box back out of the pile, if that makes a difference. \n\nChris is really upset with her, way more than I am. He is thinking of asking her to move into the dorms or an apartment next semester and now I feel a little worse that\u2019ll she be out on her ass because of me when she finally got a little stability in her life. Am I really supposed check with everyone in the house before I put trash in the trash?

Obviously she had the chance to check what was there and retrieve whatever she wanted. \n\nIf that's the case, then NTA - I don't understand what there is for her to be angry about.", "Is it possible that maybe she\u2019s feeling the pressure to move out since you\u2019ve moved in? I don\u2019t mean you guys are telling her to, but maybe she feels like since you\u2019ve moved in there\u2019s not a place for her anymore. Especially with her previous home life being unstable, these changes might be causing her outbursts. \n\nI\u2019m in no way saying it\u2019s right for her to yell at you! It\u2019s not- not in any way! I\u2019m just trying to throw out some idea in case you guys decide you want to move forward with her continuing to live there.", "It\u2019s not about the paint, but I expect you know that. You say her home life wasn\u2019t very stable. Of course she\u2019s threatened by the change in the household, even if that\u2019s not reasonable. Maybe she can find a therapist through her school? She needs support to behave like an adult. It doesn\u2019t sound like she had examples.", "NTA - she\u2019s projecting her anger on to you about the paints.  It\u2019s not really about the paints.\n\nShe feels threatened by your relationship with Chris, and she\u2019s self-sabotaging.", "NTA. I think some people are missing the point here. Chris told her everything there was his, she checked with him before hand and then AGAIN after to make sure it was okay to throw and he agreed.\nOP did not actually throw the stuff out it was just in a pile. And Emily didn\u2019t even take it out of the pile ( I think she was obliviously more upset about her things being touched rather than being thrown away ) \n\nSaying that she\u2019s a young adult undoubtedly struggling as OP stated her home life was bad I\u2019m guessing the new living situation has brought up some big emotions for her. The three of you need to have a sit down and discuss this. You made a simple mistake you should apologise and then discuss how her reaction was inappropriate and how the three of you can best move forward to make sure everyone is happy with the living situation.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sure it was extremely obvious that you have been doing a lot of cleaning / rearranging etc with the homeowners approval. \n\nEmily is an adult and needed to use her adult words to talk to you and state \u201cI have stuff in random spaces, let me see what you are throwing out before you throw it out\u201d would have worked. \n\nMaybe these were sentimental somehow? Like a childhood craft? Still not an excuse to not communicate and verbally attack you.", "INFO: did you talk to her about organizing the things ahead of time?", "Kids developed hoarding as a coping mechanism, tell your BF to cut her some slack, and maybe see if you can find a way to help her feel more stable and wanted", "NAH\n\nI think its highly likely that Emily is feeling pushed out as you move in. I'm sure its less about the objects and more about the gesture. But you weren't trying to push her out, you thought it was Chris's stuff in there. And he gave you the okay. The fact that some of the stuff was not his was an accident, and there is no excuse for her going off like that on you.\n\nYou may not be able to make peace with her, and you know what? That's okay. All you have to do is be moderately kind and polite as you have been, and if she chooses to take offense and freak out over something like this to the point that Chris wants to boot her... that's really between her and him. Chris is not *obligated* to adopt her and provide shelter and care for her. ***He is NOT her parent***.", "NTA it\u2019s clear you didn\u2019t realize it was hers and it\u2019s pretty disrespectful of her to flip out like that, she is an adult and her uncle is doing a kinds thing allowing her to live there for free while attending college. She should speak to a therapist, and if you\u2019re comfortable, maybe try asking her why she got so upset? That way you can understand the root cause because it likely wasn\u2019t about the supplies (I know she said she hates you but that\u2019s not much of a reason without an explanation of why) because she may be feeling displaced by the new living situation. Could be because she feels like you\u2019re trying to change everything?", "NTA. But I hope Chris doesn't kick her out. It sounds like you know enough to resolve this. From your perspective, totally reasonable to put out tools that can't be used anymore and no reason to think that would be an issue. Completely different story if you were recycling her artwork, which you didn't do and sounds like you never would. From hers, she finally has some stability and now someone feels entitled to throw out her stuff. Given her previous situation, she may have attached emotional value to the art material itself or just to having some say in what she owns, and blew up. Hopefully you guys can talk this through and give her another chance.", "NTA if it was literally unusable and your took this MUCH better than I would have.  Good on you for still having compassion for her situation after that.", "NAH- you seem to understand and empathize, this wasn\u2019t intentional or malicious, and I don\u2019t believe this was avoidable. Emily is obviously going through some issues, and though her outburst was uncalled for, there\u2019s obviously a deeper problem there that needs to be addressed probably by a professional", "NTA. Sounds like the niece is having a tough time.", "NTA. She way overreacted. A rational person might have been upset and maybe politely asked you to pay for what you'd discarded. For not doing that, she is the AH, not you.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t realize it was her stuff. She should have taken better care of it if she didn\u2019t want the brushes to get messed up or paint to dry out.\n\nDon\u2019t let the BF have her move into the dorms or she might resent you even though you wouldn\u2019t be making that call. Explain that to him as well. \n\nIt sounds like she looks to her uncle for stability and sees you as disrupting that or taking him away from her. \n\nJust because you\u2019re old enough to vote, enlist etc does not mean you\u2019re emotionally mature.", "NTA", "1. Chris told you all that stuff was his.\n2. You didn\u2019t throw anything out, you sorted.\n3. Emily could have retrieved her things, instead she chose to have a shrieking meltdown.\nNTA. Emily had issues. Maybe she feels displaced by you, who knows. But you have done nothing wrong.", ">hates the food I cook, hates my holidays\n\nthis is *telling*.... maybe Emily has an entirely different issue with OP...", "NTA. Ultimately, you should have checked with Chris... which you did.\n\nHer being asked to move out as a result of the drama - that is Chris's decision. Chances are there were episodes of drama before you moved in.", "[deleted]", "NTA she sounds like a brat (understandable if she comes from a bad home situation she never learned how to behave) and she should go live in the dorms and get some new social perspective and experiences- might help her\u2026 and therapy. Definitely therapy. I think maybe I\u2019m reading this different than other people but you checked with Chris who owns the home, Chris said it was all his stuff so you didn\u2019t ask her because of his claim of it being his and she freaked out but you are still being kind to her regardless of her cruelty. I don\u2019t see how you are an AH", "[deleted]", "INFO: did chris already know that box of craft stuff belonged to his niece? If so, why would he give you the ok to throw it out if it wasn\u2019t his instead of telling you, \u201chey this isn\u2019t mine this is Emily\u2019s stuff you should ask her\u201d. Especially knowing that you would not touch her stuff to begin with", "ESH\n\nIf three adults live in the home and one wants to do a clutter purge they have to ask the other two before throwing anything out. There's a few lines here that don't sit right ( 'anything **I** could use', calling the stuff cheap and not feeling sorry) that feel like Op is pushing Emily out while still not viewing her as an adult. \n\nEmily's reaction was pretty big but considering the extra factors it's not that surprising and wouldn't be surprised if there were details OP brushed off", "ESH. You don\u2019t get to assign value to anything that doesn\u2019t belong to you. Emily exploded. You two clearly have unresolved issues.  And she\u2019s a teenager. So she probably doesn\u2019t know how to express that normally.  And since you don\u2019t feel bad, there\u2019s probably a reason she doesn\u2019t like you.", "ESH. You should\u2019ve checked with everyone in the house and let everyone know you wanted to do some organizing and cleaning. I get the BF said it was all his stuff but it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to check with her. She lives there. It\u2019s her home and her first place of possible safety. \n\nThe niece sounds like she has some *major* issues that exceed beyond you setting some items aside for the trash.", "YTA..\n\nFor one simple reason. You are belittling her craft stuff.  Just because you see it as trash, does not mean it is trash for everyone.\n\nI think you only want to live with your boyfriend. You only checked it with him... Not with the niece who is also living there..\n\n\nI have a gut feeling that you feel jealous towards his niece...", "This is one of those situations where I was ready to vote Y T A but then the other person reacted soooo poorly to the original offense that it makes me want to vote N T A. I\u2019ll split the difference though and vote ESH. It\u2019s clear what the niece did wrong. To answer your question though, yes. You are really supposed to check with all adults who live in a house before you throw out something that does not belong to you.", "YTA. Sorry, but I'm having trouble putting into the words how callous and unempathetic you sound. Your entire post reeks of technically correct is the worst kind of correct.", "YTA:  Ask yourself if Emily was throwing things out and she only asked your bf and ended up throwing your things out wouldn't you be upset?  \n\nI think you know the answer", "I'm sorry OP, but YTA. This was her home first, and it sounds like she's had/is having a rough time. It's basic respect to include everyone in a household if your'e reorganizing, planning to donate or throw items away, etc. If you had given her the opportunity to be involved in the reorganizing efforts or go through the items with you (i.e., the same courtesy you extended your boyfriend), that would have been different.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nIf it isn't yours, you don't throw it out.

You live with two people. It\u2019s polite to wait for both before throwing things away. She also lives with two other people.

Judging her products for not being high end (you don\u2019t need expensive products to create).  You are petty for no longer feeling bad.

Rough home life, then someone strange (you) comes into her life and brings a bunch of new stuff along with her, PLUS you throw out her belongings - to her, it's a personal attack.\n\nThat doesn't make her response acceptable. I think your bf should consider letting her stay in the house contingent on an apology to you AND a promise to start attending regular therapy. She should be able to see a counselor through the college.", "NAH. You mentioned her unstable home life - I can almost promise you she's had to deal with her possessions being broken, hidden and thrown away by others throughout her entire life.", "NTA I agree with others that this isn\u2019t about paint. Is there any chance she has a crush on Chris? Or maybe she\u2019s concerned you\u2019ll get married and ask her to leave. \n\nWhatever Chris decides to do, stay out of it.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not about the paint because she would have taken the paints with her.\n\nThis is his family, if he wants her to move out, then let him tell her that. \n\nShe\u2019s taking her history out on you", "To answer your final question: YES! \n\nYou are the newcomer and you decided that you know best and are organizing/cleaning/donating/tossing without checking with everyone that lives there. \n\nIf it isn\u2019t yours you DO NOT have the right to give away or toss ANYTHING without all the other occupants agreeing, especially if the item(s) in question belongs to one of them. \n\nIt\u2019s called respect. \n\nTry looking at it from the other perspective, reverse the roles. How would you feel if someone took it upon themselves to completely rearrange your house and throw away your things? Even if ultimately it was junk? You\u2019d be angry like anyone else.\n\nYou said you were glad your BFs niece finally had some stability in her life. But you coming in and changing everything is taking away her stability and comfort zone. And because she reacted, your BF is now wanting to increase the instability by kicking her out. There are other alternatives to doing that. \n\nIt\u2019s nice your BF has your back, but kicking her out is the nuclear option. You all need to have a sit down and discuss what happened. You need to apologize to her for tossing her items before giving her the chance to check them out and she needs to apologize to you and your BF for her outburst.\n\nJudgement: ESH you for all the reasons stated above, BF for going nuclear, niece for the level of her outburst", "YTA you know if it was reversed and his niece moved in and decided to organize and toss your things you would be livid. To answer your question, YES you are really supposed to check with everyone in the house before tossing items that do not belong to you. Your idea of trash may have meaning to someone else. Her reaction could be a trauma response to her upbringing but it really feels more like you've left out some important details about your own behavior causing her to blow up like that.", "nta. this lady has *seriois* issues and sounds slightly unhinged.. therapy  would  be a good start and her moving our seems to be a good idea for both of you..", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nAccording to your comments you waited to move in to give the niece time. You just wanted to organize a pantry. Your purposefully leave her stuff and space alone. You thought these paints were your boyfriends moms. You ASKED him if those things were okay to throw out.

I misunderstood what she wrote about taking stuff to the trash.", "Maybe she feels that way. I don\u2019t know. We had a cordial relationship before this but she never really spoke to me much and I left her alone because that\u2019s what it seemed like she wanted. We delayed me moving in for a year to try and help her feel more secure in her life but I think she was hoping it just wouldn\u2019t happen at all", "Exactly my thoughts. Chances are something deeper was bothering her, and she communicated in the way that was most familiar. (I am assuming) she grew up around adults who lashed out, insulted and had disproportionate responses to any issue (or perceived issue). There might also be some issues with control or the perception of loss of control. \nOp If you get the chance to speak with her let her know she is loved and safe but that her response crossed a boundary. Empathize with the lack of role models in her life but remind her it is not a long term excuse for explosive behaviors. There are ways to unlearn the \"default\" response and to establish better coping skills, communication styles, etc. Therapy would definitely help. Self reflection would be a good starting place.", "Yes. \n\nBased on the extreme reaction paired with not retrieving the paints, I'm thinking that her home life involved her stuff being devalued and/or thrown away. (Either as punishment or generic disrespect from the adults that household.)\n\nIf everyone in the house is willing, OP could definitely suggest trying to talk this out and negotiate an agreement with everyone about how to better handle the cleaning/organization going forward. Support from a therapist is also really essential if possible.", "Exactly\u2014it\u2019s not about the paint.", "I hope OP reads this and understands this", "Exactly this.

It was in a pile of stuff; all the niece had to do was take it out if it was important and ask her to check with her next time. \n\nThe niece probably felt like she was losing her stability now that  girlfriend moved in, which is why she let it all out, but she could've retrieved the paint supplies if they were truly that important. I wouldn't feel bad after getting yelled at that badly either; in fact, I think she's taking it quite well.", "Nothing got thrown away! It was in a pile *to be disposed of* but was not thrown out nor did the niece take it out of the pile, so how much did she really want it? Plus, how does one replace dried out paints and crusty brushes? \n\nAlso, the niece *went off* on OP on completely unrelated things. Maybe she was upset but it\u2019s not ok to just unload on someone like that and say you hate everything about them. Does she not care about her uncle at all? That\u2019s the woman he loves so that\u2019s pretty fucked up. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad after someone told me how much they hated me either.", "Disagree OP sounds like the brat.", "OP just said that Chris claimed it was all his stuff.

But every word of her post and comments are so insufferable that I completely understand her setting someone off and them hating her being around.", "It was an honest mistake. It's not like she knew it was Emily's. Sure Emily has a right to be upset but this is way out of proportion. Bf didn't realize it was Emily's either. Then she left the box in the trash instead of pulling it out....the trash hadn't even been picked up yet. So it was important enough to flip out but not important enough to retrieve?\n\nNah\nNTA \n\nOp your bf is the one who's kicking her out because of HER actions. Not yours. Don't feel bad.", "The niece obviously saw it, or she wouldn't have gone off... so she could have taken it out of the pile.", "The nice knew where they were.  \"Emily came home and saw the pile.\".", "She left it in a pile to throw it away, niece went ballistic and did not take the stuff back out of the pile, so OP ended up throwing it away. Also: OP\u2019s bf said the items were his, she didn\u2019t know they were hers. \n\nBut once again: they WERE NOT thrown away when the niece went off on OP. They were in a pile on things to be thrown away later. Likely no contamination or damage from other to-be-thrown away items bc otherwise they would be in a bag.

It was just in a pile, not the trash itself", "She was told the contents were all her boyfriend\u2019s and then she checked with him before throwing anything out.  Sooo she exactly what you say she should have", "Tell that to Chris then. He approved all of it and said everything in the cabinet was his.", "She wasn\u2019t judging her products, she just said the paint was dried, the brushes were hardened and they weren\u2019t anything high end, therefore nothing worth keeping since it could no longer be used - NTA", "She didn't know the niece was the owner. Asked the owner of the house it was his moms. He said yes. She didn't actually throw it away and then the niece screamed at OP, insulted her, AND left her stuff in the trash pile", "Exactly. She just moved it from one spot to another - with her boyfriend's approval.  And his daughter didn't even take the box of stuff out of the pile after finding it.", "It\u2019s literally in the post that I did not", "It could just be that she feels really threatened by you moving in- it would make sense given her previous history of instability. \n\nObviously, this isn\u2019t your fault and I\u2019m absolutely not saying that you shouldn\u2019t live there. But it might be good for your BF to try to have a conversation with her- if he just throws her out it\u2019ll definitely do a lot of damage to her and any relationship she has with him. She also might benefit from therapy, if she\u2019s not already attending.", "If it was that important or sentimental she would have taken it out of the trash pile\u2026 I think you missed that part.

It was still in the pile. The Niece could have just said \"that's not trash. That's mine.\"\n\nInstead she came in and threw a tantrum. Belittling and insulting OP when there was no need for it.

I am not sure, lets ask the niece.", "[deleted]", "So in other words, you didn\u2019t ask him specifically about the box of crafts?", "I work in mental health. You have to hold people accountable for their actions. what the teen did was not okay. You can't act like that in real life.", "I wouldn't call it an honest mistake. \n\nShe moved into their home they been living in.

Than only asked her bf what's worth keeping and not the other person who lives there.  \n\nThat's not a mistake to me that disrespectful", "Two people live there other than her. How many did she ask? :)\n\nIf the math is too much, the answer is 1.

Tell him that you all can continue your current living situation and ask Emily to move out if she continues to behave the way she did this time.\n\nThis concession is because of her unstable family life growing up and these things impact people a whole lot more than they\u2019d like to", "Yep, I edited my comment.  I misunderstood your post the first time.", "Difference of opinion, here's why I think she is. \n\nShe moved into someone else's home and begun cleaning out cabinets decideding what's worth keeping when none if the items there was hers.  Seriously who does that when moving into someone else's home.....in my opinion.....assholes", "Depends on the situation. \n\nIn this one I would need more information. Personally I would talk to her and find out why she was so upset.  Because it's either she's an angry teenager or i triggrred something.  \n\nI would feel bad after I know for sure why they raged on me.", "I have a friend who refuse to throw out a pen because a friend who passed left it at their house, the pen no longer has ink been about 5 years......I'm pretty sure my friend find that pen sentimental", "She is belittling other peoples items. She is only mentioning her side at the moment.

That behavior is never acceptable.", "I said \u201cwere those your moms?\u201d when he was looking at that box. And he said \u201cyeah, probably\u201d and then moved onto the next box. So he saw the paint", "No I don\u2019t think grace means unaccountable.", "But Chris had ample opportunity to say the stuff wasn't his and to ask the niece.

OP had no way to know the niece had anything in there at all.", "But, she didn't even pull the box out of the trash pile. Clearly the stuff wasn't that important. \n\nIt's her boyfriend's house, she wasn't cleaning Emily's room or personal space. It would be easy to assume it's just the bf's stuff.

And she was told it was his.", "That's what people say when they are proven wrong. Literally all of this is in the post and comments", "As the commenter below said:\n\nShe didn't throw anything away. She made 3 piles that SHE thought the things should go in. She left it there for the owner of the house to look through and decide what to keep, throw away, etc. \n\nShe asked for permission to clean the pantry out. \n\nShe did everything she was supposed to do.\n\nThe niece is an AH for her reaction. OP is NTA at all.\n\nShe didn't deserve all of the vitrol spewed at her over some paint brushes;", "She asked him if all the stuff in the pantry was his. He said yes. She showed him the toss pile and he didn't say that some items weren't his, check with niece. Nothing was actually thrown away, it was put by the door. \n\nYou do that when the person who owns the home gives you permission and you run everything by them.", "The homeowner gave her permission and said all the stuff in that closet was his. She also asked his permission, and hadn't even thrown the item away. So how exactly is this asshole behavior? I don't see it.", "Did your friend keep it in a common cupboard among other office supplies that also don\u2019t work anymore? How sentimental are these paints to the OP\u2019s niece if they\u2019re in a pantry and she didn\u2019t even take them out of the \u201cto be disposed of\u201d (not even a trash can) pile?", "How is saying they are dried up, unusable and not an expensive brand belittling? That\u2019s just facts. She\u2019s pointing out that there\u2019s weren\u2019t expensive art supplies that she just decided to toss without a thought. They were cheap, crusty,  old paints that weren\u2019t useable anymore anyway. It\u2019s not the insult you\u2019re making it out to be.", "I mean I think the point was she thought they were trash they weren\u2019t like a nice set, they were \u201cunusable\u201d poorly taken care of so she thought they were junk and her dude confirmed it was all good to toss and was his stuff; she even mentioned that she thought it was Chris moms old brushes which I\u2019m assuming is what Chris thought. I don\u2019t think the niece actually cares about the paint stuff it\u2019s probably more the fact that she has no stability and may not have ever had her stuff respected because why would the niece leave the stuff in the garbage pile if it was so important. If I was that mad the first thing I would do was grab the stuff. Had she not asked and just thrown it out sure an AH move, and I mean if she had a problem with the neice she wouldn\u2019t have responded so kindly to the niece being an AH and saying all those things to her. Just my take", "The way OP handles Emily's stuff is also not acceptable.", "So she should be held responsible for her actions and apologize for all the stuff she screamed. Especially since she left the stuff in the trash instead of getting it.", "Do you believe it's the gf's house too now that she moved in?  I believe you would say yes and it be rude to say it's \"the bf's house'\n\nEmily lives there, OP shouldn't be throwing anything in piles to throw out when not one single item touched was hers. \n\nImagine getting a new roommate and a few months in you come home and see your stuff on the floor and they're \"cleaning\" I get the feeling you'll be a tad upset", "She had it in a pile with other things that were going to be thrown out when niece went off on her. She hadn\u2019t thrown it away yet. She threw it away later because the niece didn\u2019t take the stuff she wanted so badly.", "Wow! Can you count? There's 2 people living there so chances are the stuff wouldn't be all his regardless.\n\n\nDifferent people have different things they value - totally bonkers concept, I know!", "Lol again cool story. Take your sticker and keep in moving lol", "Again difference of opinion, we can just disagree . :)", "By...not realizing it was hers? She did everything she was suppose to. You are anti OP. And then when someone comes at you with valid points you just say difference of opinion.", "Emily lives there but it's not her house. She's Not on the lease or the deed. It would be common for one to assume her things are in her room.", "If they\u2019re cleaning a common area this would not be unreasonable. And the OP is not a \u201croommate\u201d, she\u2019s the girlfriend which carries a little more weight. It\u2019s not fair to downplay the role of the OP and honestly if anything the niece is the guest. Living with her uncle is certainly not a long term situation, maybe until she finishes college (or sooner if she can\u2019t be cicvil) and just because she was \u201cthere first\u201d doesn\u2019t make her next in the hierarchy. I get this is his family but this is his niece, not his own kid or sister, and he\u2019s doing a kindness to let her live there. She\u2019d be wise to watch herself.", "I mean she moved in with him. It's his place. So it makes sense OP would ask him.", "If you're talking legally sure.  \n\nBut like I said if OP made a post about her bf saying it's \"his house\" and not hers we all be calling him an AH saying no it's OP home she lives there", "It is Emily's home, though.", "You know exactly what you just said is part of the reason she's upset.  Because OP has the mentality you do. \n\nThat even though the niece could have been living there for years and made it into her home....she's now a \"guest\" because OP is higher up on the hierarchy.  \n\nBut hey let's just agree to disagree on this topic", "She has a right to be upset, but to blow up that much over something that clearly wasn't important enough to pull out of the trash pile....\n\nI think this us about more than old misplaced art supplies. It seems Emily was holding all this in for a while and this was her excuse to blow up and let it all out.", "What is the uncle supposed to do? Treat his niece as the woman of the house and his girlfriend as the guest? Any niece *is* a guest in her uncle\u2019s home unless she was adopted by him or they were equally responsible for the lease, neither which is the case here. I\u2019m sure he told OP to make herself at home since she now also lives there, and if she is contributing to living expenses then it certainly is more her home than Emily\u2019s. Emily will also move out someday, as adults eventually do after college. If she thought it was always going to be just her and her uncle, who\u2019s fault is that?", "But we're not talking about Emily reaction. We're talking about OP actions where you responded, It's not Emily's house so there's no reason to talk to her about it. \n\nWhere I disagreed that's my problem with OP....all I was saying", "May sound crazy but none of them are guest and it's all of their home.  May sound wild but they act like roommates where you respect each other's property", "I don\u2019t see anywhere that any property was disrespected. I do see a teenager who wildly overreacted to her uncle\u2019s girlfriend making a small mistake in putting something she thought was her boyfriend\u2019s in the I think this is trash but nothing actually got thrown away pile. And everyone who is hung up on her calling them inexpensive paints really needs to get over themselves, it\u2019s not a dig, just a fact. There is nothing wrong with cheap paints and OP never said there was. I think she just meant it to point out that she wasn\u2019t trying to toss out hundreds of dollars of expensive paints."]}
