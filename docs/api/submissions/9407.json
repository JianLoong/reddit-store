Chris\u2019s niece Emily (19F) also lives with here. Her home life was not very stable and she moved in with Chris right after her high school graduation and is now attending college in our area. \n\nIm a very organized person and I\u2019ve been cleaning out and reorganizing closets and the garage since I\u2019ve moved in. I don\u2019t touch Emily\u2019s things if it can be helped and I definitely don\u2019t go in her space. There\u2019s a little walk in pantry off the kitchen that Chris used as a general storage area and I\u2019ve been wanting to clean it out and use it as intended. \n\nI pulled everything out and sorted into 3 piles - keep, move, get rid of. \n\nOne of the things was a small box of craft paints and brushes. I checked to see if there was anything i could use in the box but besides a bag of popsicle sticks, nothing was salvageable. The brushes hadn\u2019t been washed so they were ruined and the paint was mostly dried out. So I put it in the toss pile. \n\nWhen Chris got home, I had him take a look over what I planned to get rid of and he gave me the okay. I piled the stuff headed for the trash next to the garage door to sort for the garbage in the morning. \n\nEmily came home and saw the pile. The paints were hers not Chris\u2019s moms. She got really, really angry with me for throwing her stuff out and yelled at me. Apparently she hates me. Hates my cat, hates the food I cook, hates my holidays, just dislikes everything about me. Im an idiot for not checking with her before throwing things out. I should move out. And etc. It was a lot to take in. \n\nI felt a little bad that I threw out her stuff but not too much, to be honest. None of it was usable and it wasn\u2019t high end art supplies, it was generic craft paint and cheap foam brushes. And after she finished screaming at me, I really didn\u2019t feel that bad at all anymore. She left to spend the night at her friends house. \n\nShe didn\u2019t take the box back out of the pile, if that makes a difference. \n\nChris is really upset with her, way more than I am. He is thinking of asking her to move into the dorms or an apartment next semester and now I feel a little worse that\u2019ll she be out on her ass because of me when she finally got a little stability in her life. Am I really supposed check with everyone in the house before I put trash in the trash?

Obviously she had the chance to check what was there and retrieve whatever she wanted. \n\nIf that's the case, then NTA - I don't understand what there is for her to be angry about.", "Is it possible that maybe she\u2019s feeling the pressure to move out since you\u2019ve moved in? I don\u2019t mean you guys are telling her to, but maybe she feels like since you\u2019ve moved in there\u2019s not a place for her anymore. Especially with her previous home life being unstable, these changes might be causing her outbursts. \n\nI\u2019m in no way saying it\u2019s right for her to yell at you! It\u2019s not- not in any way! I\u2019m just trying to throw out some idea in case you guys decide you want to move forward with her continuing to live there.", "It\u2019s not about the paint, but I expect you know that. You say her home life wasn\u2019t very stable. Of course she\u2019s threatened by the change in the household, even if that\u2019s not reasonable. Maybe she can find a therapist through her school? She needs support to behave like an adult. It doesn\u2019t sound like she had examples.", "NTA - she\u2019s projecting her anger on to you about the paints.  It\u2019s not really about the paints.\n\nShe feels threatened by your relationship with Chris, and she\u2019s self-sabotaging.", "NTA. I think some people are missing the point here. Chris told her everything there was his, she checked with him before hand and then AGAIN after to make sure it was okay to throw and he agreed.\nOP did not actually throw the stuff out it was just in a pile. And Emily didn\u2019t even take it out of the pile ( I think she was obliviously more upset about her things being touched rather than being thrown away ) \n\nSaying that she\u2019s a young adult undoubtedly struggling as OP stated her home life was bad I\u2019m guessing the new living situation has brought up some big emotions for her. The three of you need to have a sit down and discuss this. You made a simple mistake you should apologise and then discuss how her reaction was inappropriate and how the three of you can best move forward to make sure everyone is happy with the living situation.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sure it was extremely obvious that you have been doing a lot of cleaning / rearranging etc with the homeowners approval. \n\nEmily is an adult and needed to use her adult words to talk to you and state \u201cI have stuff in random spaces, let me see what you are throwing out before you throw it out\u201d would have worked. \n\nMaybe these were sentimental somehow? Like a childhood craft? Still not an excuse to not communicate and verbally attack you.", "INFO: did you talk to her about organizing the things ahead of time?", "Kids developed hoarding as a coping mechanism, tell your BF to cut her some slack, and maybe see if you can find a way to help her feel more stable and wanted", "NAH\n\nI think its highly likely that Emily is feeling pushed out as you move in. I'm sure its less about the objects and more about the gesture. But you weren't trying to push her out, you thought it was Chris's stuff in there. And he gave you the okay. The fact that some of the stuff was not his was an accident, and there is no excuse for her going off like that on you.\n\nYou may not be able to make peace with her, and you know what? That's okay. All you have to do is be moderately kind and polite as you have been, and if she chooses to take offense and freak out over something like this to the point that Chris wants to boot her... that's really between her and him. Chris is not *obligated* to adopt her and provide shelter and care for her. ***He is NOT her parent***.", "NTA it\u2019s clear you didn\u2019t realize it was hers and it\u2019s pretty disrespectful of her to flip out like that, she is an adult and her uncle is doing a kinds thing allowing her to live there for free while attending college. She should speak to a therapist, and if you\u2019re comfortable, maybe try asking her why she got so upset? That way you can understand the root cause because it likely wasn\u2019t about the supplies (I know she said she hates you but that\u2019s not much of a reason without an explanation of why) because she may be feeling displaced by the new living situation. Could be because she feels like you\u2019re trying to change everything?", "NTA. But I hope Chris doesn't kick her out. It sounds like you know enough to resolve this. From your perspective, totally reasonable to put out tools that can't be used anymore and no reason to think that would be an issue. Completely different story if you were recycling her artwork, which you didn't do and sounds like you never would. From hers, she finally has some stability and now someone feels entitled to throw out her stuff. Given her previous situation, she may have attached emotional value to the art material itself or just to having some say in what she owns, and blew up. Hopefully you guys can talk this through and give her another chance.", "NTA if it was literally unusable and your took this MUCH better than I would have.  Good on you for still having compassion for her situation after that.", "NAH- you seem to understand and empathize, this wasn\u2019t intentional or malicious, and I don\u2019t believe this was avoidable. Emily is obviously going through some issues, and though her outburst was uncalled for, there\u2019s obviously a deeper problem there that needs to be addressed probably by a professional", "NTA. Sounds like the niece is having a tough time.", "NTA. She way overreacted. A rational person might have been upset and maybe politely asked you to pay for what you'd discarded. For not doing that, she is the AH, not you.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t realize it was her stuff. She should have taken better care of it if she didn\u2019t want the brushes to get messed up or paint to dry out.\n\nDon\u2019t let the BF have her move into the dorms or she might resent you even though you wouldn\u2019t be making that call. Explain that to him as well. \n\nIt sounds like she looks to her uncle for stability and sees you as disrupting that or taking him away from her. \n\nJust because you\u2019re old enough to vote, enlist etc does not mean you\u2019re emotionally mature.", "NTA", "1. Chris told you all that stuff was his.\n2. You didn\u2019t throw anything out, you sorted.\n3. Emily could have retrieved her things, instead she chose to have a shrieking meltdown.\nNTA. Emily had issues. Maybe she feels displaced by you, who knows. But you have done nothing wrong.", ">hates the food I cook, hates my holidays\n\nthis is *telling*.... maybe Emily has an entirely different issue with OP...", "NTA. Ultimately, you should have checked with Chris... which you did.\n\nHer being asked to move out as a result of the drama - that is Chris's decision. Chances are there were episodes of drama before you moved in.", "[deleted]", "NTA she sounds like a brat (understandable if she comes from a bad home situation she never learned how to behave) and she should go live in the dorms and get some new social perspective and experiences- might help her\u2026 and therapy. Definitely therapy. I think maybe I\u2019m reading this different than other people but you checked with Chris who owns the home, Chris said it was all his stuff so you didn\u2019t ask her because of his claim of it being his and she freaked out but you are still being kind to her regardless of her cruelty. I don\u2019t see how you are an AH", "[deleted]", "INFO: did chris already know that box of craft stuff belonged to his niece? If so, why would he give you the ok to throw it out if it wasn\u2019t his instead of telling you, \u201chey this isn\u2019t mine this is Emily\u2019s stuff you should ask her\u201d. Especially knowing that you would not touch her stuff to begin with", "ESH\n\nIf three adults live in the home and one wants to do a clutter purge they have to ask the other two before throwing anything out. There's a few lines here that don't sit right ( 'anything **I** could use', calling the stuff cheap and not feeling sorry) that feel like Op is pushing Emily out while still not viewing her as an adult. \n\nEmily's reaction was pretty big but considering the extra factors it's not that surprising and wouldn't be surprised if there were details OP brushed off", "ESH. You don\u2019t get to assign value to anything that doesn\u2019t belong to you. Emily exploded. You two clearly have unresolved issues.  And she\u2019s a teenager. So she probably doesn\u2019t know how to express that normally.  And since you don\u2019t feel bad, there\u2019s probably a reason she doesn\u2019t like you.", "ESH. You should\u2019ve checked with everyone in the house and let everyone know you wanted to do some organizing and cleaning. I get the BF said it was all his stuff but it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to check with her. She lives there. It\u2019s her home and her first place of possible safety. \n\nThe niece sounds like she has some *major* issues that exceed beyond you setting some items aside for the trash.", "YTA..\n\nFor one simple reason. You are belittling her craft stuff.  Just because you see it as trash, does not mean it is trash for everyone.\n\nI think you only want to live with your boyfriend. You only checked it with him... Not with the niece who is also living there..\n\n\nI have a gut feeling that you feel jealous towards his niece...", "This is one of those situations where I was ready to vote Y T A but then the other person reacted soooo poorly to the original offense that it makes me want to vote N T A. I\u2019ll split the difference though and vote ESH. It\u2019s clear what the niece did wrong. To answer your question though, yes. You are really supposed to check with all adults who live in a house before you throw out something that does not belong to you.", "YTA. Sorry, but I'm having trouble putting into the words how callous and unempathetic you sound. Your entire post reeks of technically correct is the worst kind of correct.", "YTA:  Ask yourself if Emily was throwing things out and she only asked your bf and ended up throwing your things out wouldn't you be upset?  \n\nI think you know the answer", "I'm sorry OP, but YTA. This was her home first, and it sounds like she's had/is having a rough time. It's basic respect to include everyone in a household if your'e reorganizing, planning to donate or throw items away, etc. If you had given her the opportunity to be involved in the reorganizing efforts or go through the items with you (i.e., the same courtesy you extended your boyfriend), that would have been different.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nIf it isn't yours, you don't throw it out.

You live with two people. It\u2019s polite to wait for both before throwing things away. She also lives with two other people.

Her outburst was a bit much, however, your response is nasty.  Judging her products for not being high end (you don\u2019t need expensive products to create).

Rough home life, then someone strange (you) comes into her life and brings a bunch of new stuff along with her, PLUS you throw out her belongings - to her, it's a personal attack.\n\nThat doesn't make her response acceptable. I think your bf should consider letting her stay in the house contingent on an apology to you AND a promise to start attending regular therapy. She should be able to see a counselor through the college.", "NAH. You mentioned her unstable home life - I can almost promise you she's had to deal with her possessions being broken, hidden and thrown away by others throughout her entire life.", "NTA I agree with others that this isn\u2019t about paint. Is there any chance she has a crush on Chris? Or maybe she\u2019s concerned you\u2019ll get married and ask her to leave. \n\nWhatever Chris decides to do, stay out of it.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not about the paint because she would have taken the paints with her.\n\nThis is his family, if he wants her to move out, then let him tell her that. \n\nShe\u2019s taking her history out on you", "To answer your final question: YES! \n\nYou are the newcomer and you decided that you know best and are organizing/cleaning/donating/tossing without checking with everyone that lives there. \n\nIf it isn\u2019t yours you DO NOT have the right to give away or toss ANYTHING without all the other occupants agreeing, especially if the item(s) in question belongs to one of them. \n\nIt\u2019s called respect. \n\nTry looking at it from the other perspective, reverse the roles. How would you feel if someone took it upon themselves to completely rearrange your house and throw away your things? Even if ultimately it was junk? You\u2019d be angry like anyone else.\n\nYou said you were glad your BFs niece finally had some stability in her life. But you coming in and changing everything is taking away her stability and comfort zone. And because she reacted, your BF is now wanting to increase the instability by kicking her out. There are other alternatives to doing that. \n\nIt\u2019s nice your BF has your back, but kicking her out is the nuclear option. You all need to have a sit down and discuss what happened. You need to apologize to her for tossing her items before giving her the chance to check them out and she needs to apologize to you and your BF for her outburst.\n\nJudgement: ESH you for all the reasons stated above, BF for going nuclear, niece for the level of her outburst", "YTA you know if it was reversed and his niece moved in and decided to organize and toss your things you would be livid. To answer your question, YES you are really supposed to check with everyone in the house before tossing items that do not belong to you. Your idea of trash may have meaning to someone else. Her reaction could be a trauma response to her upbringing but it really feels more like you've left out some important details about your own behavior causing her to blow up like that.", "nta. this lady has *seriois* issues and sounds slightly unhinged.. therapy  would  be a good start and her moving our seems to be a good idea for both of you..", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nAccording to your comments you waited to move in to give the niece time.

I misunderstood what she wrote about taking stuff to the trash.", "Maybe she feels that way. I don\u2019t know. We had a cordial relationship before this but she never really spoke to me much and I left her alone because that\u2019s what it seemed like she wanted. We delayed me moving in for a year to try and help her feel more secure in her life but I think she was hoping it just wouldn\u2019t happen at all", "Exactly my thoughts. Chances are something deeper was bothering her, and she communicated in the way that was most familiar. (I am assuming) she grew up around adults who lashed out, insulted and had disproportionate responses to any issue (or perceived issue). There might also be some issues with control or the perception of loss of control. \nOp If you get the chance to speak with her let her know she is loved and safe but that her response crossed a boundary. Empathize with the lack of role models in her life but remind her it is not a long term excuse for explosive behaviors. There are ways to unlearn the \"default\" response and to establish better coping skills, communication styles, etc. Therapy would definitely help. Self reflection would be a good starting place.", "Yes. \n\nBased on the extreme reaction paired with not retrieving the paints, I'm thinking that her home life involved her stuff being devalued and/or thrown away. (Either as punishment or generic disrespect from the adults that household.)\n\nIf everyone in the house is willing, OP could definitely suggest trying to talk this out and negotiate an agreement with everyone about how to better handle the cleaning/organization going forward. Support from a therapist is also really essential if possible.", "Exactly\u2014it\u2019s not about the paint.", "I hope OP reads this and understands this", "Exactly this.

It was in a pile of stuff; all the niece had to do was take it out if it was important and ask her to check with her next time. \n\nThe niece probably felt like she was losing her stability now that  girlfriend moved in, which is why she let it all out, but she could've retrieved the paint supplies if they were truly that important. I wouldn't feel bad after getting yelled at that badly either; in fact, I think she's taking it quite well.", "Nothing got thrown away! It was in a pile *to be disposed of* but was not thrown out nor did the niece take it out of the pile, so how much did she really want it? Plus, how does one replace dried out paints and crusty brushes? \n\nAlso, the niece *went off* on OP on completely unrelated things. Maybe she was upset but it\u2019s not ok to just unload on someone like that and say you hate everything about them. Does she not care about her uncle at all? That\u2019s the woman he loves so that\u2019s pretty fucked up. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad after someone told me how much they hated me either.", "Disagree OP sounds like the brat.", "OP just said that Chris claimed it was all his stuff.

Make her feel safe, but also gently clarify that there needs to  be mutual respect if she wants to continue living there.\n\nPlease, please discourage BF from kicking her out.  Was her reaction entirely inappropriate?  Yes - of course.  But it sounds like she is a traumatized kid lashing out and she desperately needs support, not more instability.  Tossing her out is not going to help her.", "NTA", "Personally, if I was the new person moving in with 2 people who've already established their living space, I wouldn't have even thought about changing something in that established common place. I know the owner is your boyfriend but I wouldn't have any intentions towards changing what he's already chosen inside his home. I wouldn't think that I had the right to do it especially since he had a roommate.\n\nSo, I wouldn't have tossed anything in that pile, whether it looked like trash or not.\n\nIf I were his niece, I'd probably feel like you were marking your territory, against me. And she might feel like her uncle just tossed her away too. Before you moved in and set your intentions on changing their established space into what you wanted...her uncle was ok with their arrangement. Also, because she left it in the trash when you talked to her, I'd believe that proved what her issue with you is.\n\nWith all that being said, I believe that Chris, should've set rules with both of you present, when you first moved in, so neither one of you felt that you had a right to make intentions on his space.", "\u201chates the food I cook, hates my holidays\u201d\n\nThere could very well be a reason for why the niece is so angry and it doesn\u2019t look so good for the niece.", "My charitable guess is that niece's unstable home life involved people not respecting her stuff, and she was triggered. Because logically her reaction makes no sense. Her reaction was so over the top as to warrant reconsidering the living arrangements, unless she comes to her senses and apologizes. NTA.", "I\u2019m guessing her sense of control felt threatened.\n\nNTA.", "OP DID check. With the actual owner of the house. She checked before she touched it, she checked after she sorted it, and she had him *double* check the trash pile to make sure it could all go. And it wasn\u2019t even thrown out yet! Emily was perfectly free to grab it, and in her nasty little fit she would\u2019ve made a grand scene of pulling it all out to take with her. \n\nOP had those thoughts while thinking it was Chris\u2019 stuff, not Emily\u2019s. Her thought process was along those lines, not some malicious intent to trash Emily\u2019s things just because she couldn\u2019t take it and use it. And be honest, that stuff *was* trash. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t feel sorry about throwing obvious trash away after the way she treated me either. A grown girl throwing a tantrum, hurling insults and terrible things at me, about useless art supplies doesn\u2019t really inspire compassion. And OP even clearly mentioned it was *after* the horrible things she said that she stopped feeling sorry.", "I'm going with NAH. OP did nothing wrong. It's not about the paint. It's about what OP represents. Change.\n\nThe niece had no stability in her life until she moved in with her uncle. She has only had that for just over a year. Now you move in and start making changes. It's scary. \n\nSo she lashes out. She doesn't have the emotional maturity for coping with that change. She may see you throwing her things away as throwing her away and her uncle is allowing it to happen. The last thing that should happen right now is for uncle to ask her to leave.\n\nWould it be possible for you to reach out and try to be there for her? Find some common ground. Take an art class or start cooking with her, maybe. \n\nMake her the little sister you never had. Let her know that you aren't pushing her out of the house, just squeezing her over to make room for you. Good luck.", "So either Chris didn't check the cupboard or just didn't care about his nieces stuff. Outch.", "I think OP maybe should have waited for the third person living at home to check things over for toss or not, tbh. But since she didn't throw things out entirely it's forgivable. Just, if you live with multiple people you should check with multiple people.", "And OP didn't have the common sense to ask the niece if she had anything in there.", "That is true", "Or maybe asking if Niece would like to help", "And she had permission from the homeowner, plus the other resident was able to look at the \"to discard\" pile before anything was actually thrown away. When she chose not to keep anything from the pile, at that point it was entirely on her and no longer OP.", "Yeah, I don't think op has any desire to have a relationship with the niece. She moved in and is changing everything, knowing the niece hasn't had stability and doesn't seem to care. And saying her stuff is trash. I don't think she wants the niece there.", "You sound so rude and condescending.

What's the point of your comment? Not doing what your parents say isn't inherently good.", "[deleted]", "That's not what I said... I said it makes sense to ask the owner of a place if it's ok to get rid of something. Most people probably wouldn't meticulously go to every person in a household. Not to mention, OP didn't even throw anything out. She put it in a pile to be thrown out. That's when her boyfriend's niece found it. It was a complete overreaction.", "I'm thinking all that she said was piling up. She was basically looking for a random reason to put you in a bad light and \\*ehm ehm\\* tell you to move out? And who exactly is she to tell you that? \n\nChris is right to be upset that his niece started insulting everything about you and making unreasonable demands, especially over something that she obviously doesn't care about, otherwise why leaving it there where you put it and *especially* why saying so many bad things about you that have no correlation to the problem in question? \n\nDon't worry about it, you're good. NTA", "NTA\n\nBut I hope you understand it wasn't about the paint brushes and paint.\n\nRe-read what you said about what she said to you; she dislikes you. And now you're living in 'her' house. Dating her brother was one thing and maybe she didn't think you two would last but here you are, under the same roof together. \n\nIt definitely not about the paint brushes and paint.", "NTA for the actual process described here, but... you moved in and started 'cleaning out and reorganizing closets and the garage since I\u2019ve moved in'. You say you don't touch Emily's things, but she doesn't just live in her bedroom - it was her home, and you're turning it upside down, apparently without any discussion. \n\nYou come across to me as someone who is quite judgemental about mess. Emily may have liked the house the way it was. She needed stability, right? So you moved in and started changing things - effectively destabilising her living situation and making her home feel like someone else's home, and probably silently judging all her home-making and housekeeping (eg 'I\u2019ve been wanting to clean it out and use it as intended.' There's a clear judgement there.)\n\nAs a messy person, frankly, I'd hate to live with you, and I kinda feel for Emily in this situation.", "NTA and she needs to move out now, she is so disrespectful to you and you are accepting it? Your bf seems more upset than you. She needs to leave.", "NTA", "NTA but I think Emily is reacting to something else going on. Every behaviour is a communication of a need. Either you or Chris need to sit her down and have a conversation about her state of mental health (probably Chris since she's his niece not yours). I suspect she's having a hard time handling the change in having a new house member. Everything is different for her, and that's scary for a young person, especially if they've lived an unstable home life. Throwing her paints out is just the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't think it was about the paints at all.", "NTA  after he tells her to move out I would watch my cat, if the niece hates her and hates you,OP. Not a good combo.", "NTA but certainly could have handled the situation better by asking her to look in the toss pile to be sure you weren\u2019t discarding anything that had meaning to her. She has some pretty strong feeling about you that precede this escapade and I imagine at least some of those feeling are rooted in her feeling threatened by the escalation of your relationship with someone that saved her and her fear that he was moving away from her. I understand she isn\u2019t your blood but I suspect your actions and words haven\u2019t always been guided by an acknowledgement that this young girl has some scars that require a bit more sense it\u2019s on your part. She is 19 and will fly the coop on her own in the near future but in the meantime try mending fences as that would be the compassionate thing to do", "Soft ESH. \n\nIt looks like OP moved in and decided to change everything to her liking. More often than not guys just don't give a shit about that, but for women it can even be a sort of territory battle. It's like OP is going there and says - I don't like and care how you did it, now i'm the most important here and you have to abide. Of course the niece feels threatened and unwanted.  \nAnd yes, I believe it's supposed to check with everyone living in the house before throwing away stuff. Especially if they live there before you.   \nThe niece's reaction though was very exaggerated. She could've tried talking with OP to achieve some common ground, but it looks like she isn't even trying to be in good terms with her.", ">When Chris got home, I had him take a look over what I planned to get rid of and he gave me the okay. I piled the stuff headed for the trash next to the garage door to sort for the garbage in the morning\n\nNTA\n\n>She didn\u2019t take the box back out of the pile, if that makes a difference\n\nIt does, actually - if she didn't move it, she's okay with it being thrown out.\n\nstill NTA.", "NTA BUT This isn\u2019t about the paints. Chris is her stable life and you are coming in rearranging and changing the one stable thing she has. YOU NEED TO REALIZE THIS SO DOES HE this isn\u2019t easy for her especially considering home situations. \n\nSo 1) I know you like organized stuff don\u2019t start organizing right away\u2026. Leave it be if it\u2019s in a common space this is clearly a trigger and slowly overtime move things around but don\u2019t make big changes \n\n2) think about why she said what she said. I think it was her way of lashing out and not all of its true again it\u2019s a lot of change for her. \n\n3) talk to her and have a conversation about this. This is a big deal to her and to you and Chris", "NTA if Brice hates you so much she needs to get a job and move since home isn\u2019t an option.

You have recently moved into the space that someone else lives and who moved there after having to leave un unstable home. Do you not understand that? She literally tells you how upset she is and you just completely fail to empathise.\n\nThis house is now your home, but you need to show consideration to others. This is a vulnerable young person who needs to feel safe, show some basic empathy.", "YTA\n\nWhat prevents you from telling people in the house:\n\nHey I'm going to be cleaning the pantry, once you get home can we sort through what was in there?\n\nBut no, you just up and decided to sort through stuff, and decided what was junk and what wasn't. \n\nHow would you feel if you came home to find your belongings nicely stacked in the 'to trash pile'? Of course she blew up at you.", "It sounds as though no she just doesn\u2019t like OP living there because it upset the dynamic of the household. This was just something to focus that on.", "I think the Iranian art supplies is not the problem. \n\nI think this is general lashing out because OP has moved in and taken it upon themselves to changed and reorganise everything, leaving the niece feeling like she is slowly being pushed out.", "Niece losing her territory. Lashing out after bottling up all her jealousy.", "It had already been moved to the 'this is trash that gets thrown out' pile. How would you feel if you came home and your belongings were stacked there?", "Yeah, NTA. She definitely needs therapy to help her with her issues.", "Imagine someone just moved in into your place, and when you get home your stuff is sitting next to the trash bins. I can see how the 19y old would explode.", "I mean, I feel like a lot of people are missing out on Emily screaming that she hates OP's 'different holidays'. It's possible to have empathy for her, but uh that huge overreaction might be partially from bigotry and would explain why the boyfriend is so angry at his niece....it's possible he's picked up on the bigotry but OP has not.", "I hope op tries with Chris and the niece  therapy  however  if the niece  continues the behavior  it's best she moves out .this should  be said  clearly  to the niece along with the fact they are not trying  to throw her out of the house  but that remaining  to live there requires  the niece  to respect op and her relationship  with Chris  their boundaries  and avoid interfering in said relationship.\n\nNta op.", "Who. Fucking. Cares. Who. Owns. The. Home? By this \u201clogic\u201d what you are setting up is that if these two ever have kids, then the kids have no rights because they can\u2019t own the house they live in.", "I don't think it's different, because from the beginning her intention was to actually toss everything away without ever asking the niece. It just happened that she first saw what's going on. \n\n(I'm not trying to excuse niece's behaviour, I also find it unacceptable, but let's not pretend that it wasn't just coincidence the stuff was still here)", "Right? Those lines stuck out to me too. OP is definitely from a different culture than her boyfriend and his niece.", ">niece's unstable home life involved people not respecting her stuff, and she was triggered.\n\nThis 100%", "I'm going to be honest....while it's possible to have empathy for Emily the 'different holidays' is a giant red flag. I'm guessing you aren't white and/or Christian? That may be while your boyfriend is so mad....there may be have been some latent bigotry that you haven't picked up on but he has picked up.", "This is, sadly, how it usually goes: \n\nAITA: She's racist.\n\nOP: You think?\n\nOP: [Update] She is racist.", ">Hates my cat, hates the food I cook, hates my holidays, just dislikes everything about me. Im an idiot for not checking with her before throwing things out. I should move out.\n\nYeah, this feels like it is less about the art supplies and more about the feeling of losing control of her safe space. Clearly she is bothered by what she sees as the intrusion of someone else into that space. That your BF didn't recognise the stuff says a lot. It's been clearly sitting there untouched for ages, long enough that he forgot they existed, if he had even noticed them to begin with. That doesn't justify her lashing out at you though. You're NTA because you only sorted out the space after your BF gave you the all clear, but he definitely needs to talk with his niece and clarify how she's feeling and that you will be a part of his life going forward.", "In the future, I would just try to include her in the process. When you pull stuff out to sort, ask her if any of it is hers. It doesn't matter if it looks like junk to you, just check what is hers and let her decide what to fo with it. Also, try to avoid a blanket 'if it's hers it goes to her room' approach. Try to leave places outside her room for her to keep or display things. You could even have Chris do the asking if she gets upset at you, so you don't have to get yelled at", "What is the fucking obsession with the OwNeR of the house? (Are we even sure he DOES own?) so no one else who lives in a house counts got shit? Big yikes.

Seriously, how would feel if she started throwing away your stuff because he said 'yeah, probably '? This could all have been avoided by a 2 second conversation with the niece or have you forgotten that it is her house as much as it is yours.", "The supplies were put in a pile to be discarded, not actually **in** the trash. Read the post properly before commenting. OP hadn't thrown them out already.", "But she was going to throw them out and made no mention anywhere that she was going to check with the niece. The point I was making is that she should have checked with all occupants before anything was marked to be thrown out.", "OP told BF she wanted to sort out the storage closet. BF told her everything in there was his. She found a bunch of unusable art supplies and left them out for sorting. He came home, she asked if they were his mom's, and he said yes. Clearly those supplies have been sitting there for so long that BF had forgotten they were there at all, and the niece hasn't touched them for ages. So OP does what any sane person does and puts them in the trash pile where the niece sees them and throws a fit. Explain to me exactly where OP is at fault in all this?\n\nNo, the art supplies are not the real issue here. But OP isn't at fault for behaving like any reasonable human being."]}
