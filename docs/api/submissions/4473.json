She started talking about haircuts and how she wanted the smallest trim, that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. I told her I had a trim kit in my restroom and she told me to get it. I showed her the trimmer and she asked me if I could trim the bottom. I did so, or I thought I did so as when we woke up, the majority of her hair was in the bath and she had an uneven Bob. \n\nMy sister started to freak out and was in complete shock, i was too. After a while of me calming her down and telling her she looks fancy, she told me that she must do the same to me and went to go look for my trimmer. I love my hair and wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. She kept insisting that it was the only way things could ever be good. \n\nI told her no and hid my trimmer, she proceeded to get upset and told me that now she was now ugly and ruined.

This sounds intentional YTA", "YTA\nAt least pay for a decent hair cut.", "Of course YTA, how drunk were you that you didn\u2019t realize you cut off the majority of her hair?", "YTA. You drunkenly butchered her hair, then lie to her telling her she looks \"fancy\" to cover your own guilt, then ditched that lie when she suggested doing the same to your hair.", "Did you really need to ask, of course YTA", "lol, I... ... ESH  \n\n\nYou both got drunk and ridiculous. If anything, the only correct thing you *did* do was hide the cutting tools afterwards until you both sobered up. But her asking you to cut it drunk and then getting mad it didn't work out, and you *agreeing* to cut it drunk... you both messed up.   \n\n\nHair grows back. Laugh about this together as a learning experience.", "Yes YTA.  How drunk were you that you thought you thought cutting hair was a good idea?  Or could not tell the difference between a small trim and all her hair?", "ESH - assuming you are in the US, you are too young to drink anyways.  You both were too drunk to realize that cutting hair drunk is a very bad idea.  You ruined your sisters hair, but she let you.  Now she wants to ruin your hair.  You two are way to immature to be drinking like this.", "YTA. Maybe cut back the drinking a little. This goes for the both of you.", "ESH. You both need to stop drinking so much.\n\nShe did ask for the haircut and you don't remember what happened but it doesn't sound like either of you remembers you maliciosuly cutting off too much. But you should apologize and offer to pay for a hairdresser and maybe get her some nice hair decorations that go with the new haircut, try and make it up somehow.\n\nShe is the AH for suggesting that she cuts your hair off too. And for asking for something dead drunk and then blaming others when she regrets the consequences.", "Yes you\u2019re the asshole, but so if she for allowing someone to cut her hair basically black out drunk (it seems).

And couldn\u2019t recount any of it, so that it could be called an accident. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you planned this tbh, she just coincidentally talks about wanting to trim her hair while at your place and you somehow have a hair trimmer on hand and ready to use on her. Why did you feel confident in trimming her ends when you acknowledged you were drunk?", "Info: why did you do this to her?", "LOL of course YTA", "YTA, you got drunk and cut your sister's hair.", "ESH.", "YTA. Did you at least apologise? Why did you do it? Sounds like you were jealous of her hair. In that case, I hope she trims your hair when you're asleep.

Then you didn't even have the grace to offer to pay for her to get it fixed up at a salon.\n\nYou guys are old enough to know that you NEVER trim your hair or do you brows while drunk. EVER. Now look at what happened!", "ESH. You both were drunk and made a bad decision together. If you truly didn't mean to and it was an accident then I hope this is a lesson learned by both of you.

You did that on purpose. I fully expect her to do the same to you next time you get drunk.", "YTA. You didn't have to as us.

You didn't coerce her into the haircut, yall were just drunk and dumb and you should both learn from it and keep the scissors and sharp objects away while drinking.\n\nHer wanting to butcher your hair while sober is too much. She made a drunk decision and has to live with it.  Extensions and wigs are a thing.\n\nAnyone who says she deserves to butcher your hair is whacked and apparently they don't think your sister should have any accountability and that's not okay.\n\nSigned, someone who has gotten an ugly drunk tattoo and didn't take it out on my friends or the artist, since it was my fault entirely for drinking that much, coming up with the idea, and then immediately seeing it through while drunk.  Never repeated my mistake and didn't drag anyone down with me.", "nta. people here are really acting like you just maliciously chopped it all off. you both were seemingly blacked out drunk and SHE FUCKING ASKED YOU TO DO IT. then turned around and blamed you when she asked you to do something that pros mess up sober when you were clearly too drunk to do it. then wants to ruin yours too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You do owe herhalf the money for a salon appointment.", "Sounds like we missed a lot of context because drunk or not, a trim vs cutting all her hair off was either an absolute freak accident, or your not telling us something. You\u2019re both young and I won\u2019t tell you you shouldn\u2019t drink as that\u2019s the prime age for that kind of nonsense. But I\u2019m not buying that it just accidentally ended up in a bob. Also it\u2019s hair, if your sister is asking you to cut yours to match, do it. You\u2019ll have a funny story to tell years from now and your hair will grow back.", "Adding that if you don\u2019t cut your hair now, she may get her revenge. I\u2019m thinking of myself at your age and I woulda been pretty pissed. I feel like if you just cut your own hair now, you\u2019ll have a funny story but if you wait you could just be damaging the relationship further.", "Lesson learned. Do not cut hair when inebriated. It doesn\u2019t end well. ESH.", "YTA. This story is hilarious though lol. The least you can do is pay for her to go to a hairdresser though.", "ESH, please learn to drink responsibly and stop doing/getting haircuts in an intoxicated state.\n\nTalk to your sister, appologise, help her sort her hair and explain that the situation won't be fixed by her destroying your hair.", "ESH. You two need to drink more responsibly before you do something really stupid.\n\nNo, she shouldn\u2019t cut your hair. But the right thing to do would be to pay for a professional to fix up her hair.", "ESH..... Stop drinking for the next 10 yrs, plz, both of you.  Maybe you'll grow up and be able to handle some liquor by then?  Maybe.....", "ESH, you both need to cut back your alcohol intake. I\u2019m saying this as a healthcare professional, you both seem to be on a dangerous path if this is your normal. Thankfully the liver is resilient but still one never know which drink will push them over the edge undo end stage liver disease.\n\nI\u2019m going to assume you both were very far drunk in order for her to not realize how high you were cutting, only to realize it in the morning. You were also too far drunk to not be able to tell the difference in trimming the bottom of her hair and towards her shoulders.\n\nAgain, cut back drinking. If you thought you were sober enough to do a hair cut then I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re the kind of person who would drive drunk and kill someone. Get help if you\u2019re unable to cut back drinking on your own. Lessons learned for you both last night.", "YTA\n\nWhat the fuck were you thinking?  Hair cuts and being drunk are a terrible idea.  And, if your hair matters so much to you, why can't you grasp how she must feel about this.\n\nReminds of the time my roommates dropped acid and gave each other haircuts with Exacto knives.\n\nShort.  They had very short hair after.  That's what happens when you obsess on making both sides exactly even.", "Yta, a jealous-sounding one at that.\n\nFyi, hair grows back.", "Ofc YTA jealous or drunk?", "NTA. I cut off most of my best friend's hair once at a party. We were both drunk and she had her caught in a door. I was just trying to be helpful.", "NTA I like how everyone's blaming op they were both drunk", "You suck.", "How long is long to you? Waist length?  That takes years to grow out. Some people consider shoulder length long (which isnt) but could be grown in 12 months, MAYBE 6", "YTA i just don\u2019t believe you went from offering a trim to cutting off a majority of her hair without knowing, seems like you\u2019re trying to play dumb", "Be honest. You were/ARE jealous so you butchered her hair! You're jealous of your sister and YOU are resentful of her.

And her sister got drunk and asked/let her", "Sounds like a scene from Sixteen Candles", "So how exactly is sister an AH here then if OP isn't?", "Another drunk person.", "It is kinda reminiscent...", "Exactly. Being drunk doesn't absolve you of guilt for an actual crime, so it's on sister too."]}
