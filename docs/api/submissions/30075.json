There's nothing preventing him from learning Spanish and the best time to teach a second language is childhood.", "NTA\n\nTell him to stay there forever", "NTA. My children speak fluent Welsh. We don't even live in Wales. Even some people born and raised in Wales don't speak Welsh. However, it is important to me, and so I speak Welsh to my children. Same deal with your child and Spanish.

My justification is personal: \n\nMy dad is a native Spanish speaker and didn't raise my brother and I to speak Spanish at home because my mom didn't speak it and felt \"left out\". He has straight up admitted that he regrets that decision. I picked up some things from exposure, high school classes, etc. here and there, but events on that side of the family used to be so goddamn embarrassing for me. \n\nI'm trying to learn Spanish now as an adult (with dad's help) and it's very slow going. A whopping 600+ day streak on Duolingo and I'm still working on past-tense. \n\nKids brains are hard wired for language acquisition.

It has opened me up to so many aspects of my home culture, from food to films to literature. It has enriched my life so much and I am really happy that I had the chance to be exposed to it from a young age.  I am the only one of my siblings that speaks them fluently, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that I have better relationships with my relatives.

Is he always like that?", "1) He's being silly. \n\n2) There's something bigger at the bottom of this. Maybe he already feels left out of the bond you have with the baby. Marriage counseling could help. \n\n3) It will genuinely be an inconvenience for him because the child will quickly be more fluent than he will be, even if he works at learning. It will cause minor miscommunication in your home on a daily basis. (One example of many: you'll tell the child to do something, he'll misunderstand slightly, and he'll start telling the child they need to obey Mama right now when the child actually is obeying already.) **I know this because I live it.** If you do this, you need to *respect the fact that it's honestly very, very inconvenient for him.* On high stress days around here (about once a month) we have an \"English only\" day because there's already enough happening without the added stress of miscommunication between parents. It genuinely makes parenting harder, especially for the person who doesn't speak the language.", "YTA you had almost a year (assuming a whole pregnancy and the last two.months) to talk about bringing up your kid bilingually and you haven't done that?
