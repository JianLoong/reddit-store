A whopping 600+ day streak on Duolingo and I'm still working on past-tense. \n\nKids brains are hard wired for language acquisition.

I am the only one of my siblings that speaks them fluently, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that I have better relationships with my relatives.

Marriage counseling could help. \n\n3) It will genuinely be an inconvenience for him because the child will quickly be more fluent than he will be, even if he works at learning. It will cause minor miscommunication in your home on a daily basis. (One example of many: you'll tell the child to do something, he'll misunderstand slightly, and he'll start telling the child they need to obey Mama right now when the child actually is obeying already.) **I know this because I live it.** If you do this, you need to *respect the fact that it's honestly very, very inconvenient for him.* On high stress days around here (about once a month) we have an \"English only\" day because there's already enough happening without the added stress of miscommunication between parents.

Children are born with the ability to learn any language, including African dialects that use clicks. Over time they learn to use only those sounds that are associated with their primary language. Until they're about 12 years old they have the ability to pick up many languages. I think it's incumbent upon every parent who speaks a second language to teach their children. It will serve them well over time. Kids also have an amazing capacity to decode a situation. I knew a woman whose kids could speak Urdu to her in-laws and without batting an eye, turn around and speak to her in English. They naturally knew which language to speak with whom. They were 4 and 6 years old. Please get some counseling so you can find out what your husband's concern is really based on.
