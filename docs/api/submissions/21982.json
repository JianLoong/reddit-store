We honestly just don't know. But you'd think we'd know enough to keep our mouths shut...\nAnyway, that said I think it's all about family and their perspective on nudity (not breastfeeding, just nudity in general). My family was extremely modest. Some families are not. I wouldn't do as you do myself, but I'm not you! I would just reinforce boundaries with her. But I believe it would help your relationship if you just didn't make it awkward for her. I mean, maybe give yourself a little break from her \"I'm going to feed baby now. See you in 20. Look after the boys please.\" AND THEN ENJOY YOUR PEACE! You get a bit of a mental break, and she won't get riled up.
