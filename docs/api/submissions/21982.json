The gap between me and my baby sister is just under 14 years and I most certainly never felt violated or anything. Breast feeding is the natural purpose of breasts, the baby has to eat, that\u2019s what the babies food is coming from, why people sexualize that is beyond me because it\u2019s not. When I was trying to breastfeed my son (ended up switching to formula because that\u2019s what worked for us) I fed him whenever he was hungry wherever I was. If I had company over I would say \u201chey I\u2019m about to feed the baby, look away if you\u2019re uncomfortable seeing that\u201d or something similar because I know some people are, but especially in the comfort of my own home I never gave it a second thought. Feed your baby and don\u2019t let anyone tell you you\u2019re wrong for how you do it (as long as baby is getting fed what they need). \u2764\ufe0f", "My son was 4 when I breastfed my daughter.

Actually - its good and healthy for them to have a natural perspective of breasts. Nothing more disgusting than men who act like beasts around womens body parts because all they know is the sexualized concept of women. \nShe is projecting her harmful dated bs onto them and you.

BOOBS ARE FOR FEEDING BABIES!!! THAT'S WHY WE ONLY MAKE MILK WHEN HAVING A CHILD!!\n\n\nBreastfeeding infront of your son's teaches them that boobs have a purpose and are not there for their sexual desires.

Their future partners will appreciate you teaching them how to treat women like normal human beings and not sexual objects. \n\nIf MIL has an issue with you feeding your baby in your own home SHE needs to leave.
