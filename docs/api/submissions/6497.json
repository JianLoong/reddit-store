One of my closest friends is getting married this year and she still wants to go on girls trips internationally even after she\u2019s married, she straight up asked if I want to do a U.K. girls trip with her and her sister in 2024. And my best friend of the past 21 years, who I don\u2019t see often, will always be a priority in my life even if I do get married one day - I rarely get to see her and she\u2019s the closest thing I have a sister and we plan on taking regular girls trips together no matter where our lives take us. It\u2019s astounding that so many people think you can\u2019t go on trips without your spouse once you get married. I\u2019ve seen both my parents go on girls/guys trips with their friends too. If you never get hubby-less time with your BFF/SIL, it\u2019s not a crime to want to have that time. Maybe she can ask her parents to help fund her.\n\nAs long as your husband is generally your top priority, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t prioritize your childhood best friend once in a while (given kids aren\u2019t in the picture yet).\n\nInfo - have you talked to your husband about you making more girl time for her?", "YTA that\u2019s how marriage works.

I went to a birthday dinner for my gf of two years at the time that included her parents and our shared friendship group. \n\nThe dinner went for a good 3-4 hours and in that time she didn\u2019t say a single word to me, she wouldn\u2019t even make eye contact with me. At first I dismissed it but it soon became clear something was up. By the end of the night I was on the verge of having a full blown temper tantrum. Multiple times I tried to engage her and she would give me a few brief responses and then move onto someone else straight away. \n\nSo about 4 hours into the night I decided it was best that I left rather than get more obviously upset and potentially cause a scene. When I went to say goodbye to her all of a sudden she returned to her usual self and almost seemed hurt that I was the one leaving. \n\nAgain just like your post I was bamboozled. Was I being put on? Was this some sort of petty revenge for something I had unknowingly done wrong? \n\nWe had never once had a full on argument and this was probably the first time I felt any sort of hostility from her, and since there was nothing to cause it I was left bemused to say the least. \n\nWhen I next saw her I instantly brought it up and she said she had not intended anything, and had simply been swept up in the night. \n\nReasonable? Yeah maybe, but just like with your husband that feeling of exclusion even in such a small way can intensely sting. \n\nNow imagine how your husband must be feeling having learnt his wife wanted to exclude him from an international trip? \n\nFrankly I\u2019m amazed he hasn\u2019t already left to stay somewhere else or brought up the D word. If he doesn\u2019t consider yourself blessed with a very patient partner, and one you owe a shitload of apologies towards. \n\nOne last piece of advice, never get involved in the family drama stuff with the sister. If she ever brings it up with you just politely tell her you\u2019d like to change the topic.
