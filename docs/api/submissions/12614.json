It sounds like you were disciplining a child who probably needed it and the child instead of accepting correction wanted to explain to you why you were wrong and why you were misunderstanding her. Emotionally well adjusted 28 year olds don't carry grudges about getting in trouble for talking back in elementary school. That's not a particularly serious infraction.", "NTA. Girlfriend sounds a wee bit unhinged to be bearing a grudge over a teacher's note for two decades.", "NTA, if you're speaking the truth. And you didn't even flip out. You kept apologizing for something which you \\*probably\\* didn't do. That makes you the bigger woman \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*^(Even if you're lying, it's very silly to hold a grudge anyway. I still don't think that the \"talking back\" thing should be an excuse to send a note.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Jessie seems like an asshole though*", "In life, we don't always realize how our words and actions can appear to others. So things we say innocently can be very hurtful to the person we are talking to. And miscommunication often is the \"fault\" of both parties.\n\nBut let's assume that she is completely right and you were 100% at fault: she made a perfectly innocent remark that you took it wildly out of context and scolded her for genuinely asking for help. So you punished her by... informing her parents? That's not an unreasonable punishment. And if her parents were decent, they would have listened to her side of the story, spoken to her about how she needs to be respectful of others, how others need to be respectful of her and possibly followed up with you if they agreed that you had been unfair.\n\nAt the end of the day, you didn't do it to be mean. You didn't continue to punish her for the rest of the school year. So the only thing you did wrong was the miscommunication, which you have now apologized for. I normally insist that--to be a true apology--one has to make restitution to the victim, but in this case, that would be simply telling her parents that you apparently made a mistake and shouldn't have sent home a note. Since she is no longer a child living at home with her parents, that isn't *necessary*, but since she's still upset, you could offer it...but beyond that, there's really nothing more you can do.\n\nIf she has further grievances with you (with *you* specifically, not with the school overall), she should tell you. \n\nBut while she has no obligation to accept your apology, that doesn't give her license to be rude to you now. So regardless of who was that fault for the original conflict, you are NTA now.", "NTA. You apologized for it and did the best you could with what you knew.

I will say that unfair situations concerning childhood teachers can have a lasting impact on someone\u2019s outcome in life/education and she feels bitter and simply hasn\u2019t forgotten it. She probably just needs time to sit with the realization, but I also don\u2019t think she handled it in the most mature way. I would offer some grace, because she probably feels that the hand she was dealt screwed up parts of her life in the long term (ie what she said, irreparable damage).", "NTA Tell Jessie to get over it and get it in her head that whatever happened didn't involve you.

But I think you suck because you're seem quick to forget your wrongdoing, while remembering what everyone else thought of her when she was still at school.\n\nYou were standing up for yourself, but I understand why she is upset. Some teachers are mean, and they don't really care if their opinions are overly harsh or not at all based on facts, thereby destroying children's self-confidence. \n\nYes, I understand some children do need special education, but not all do (even if they need special education... they could have gone through trauma, or have depression etc. which ultimately leads to poor performance at school).", "[deleted]", "No way did a single note lead to homeschooling. Sounds like her parents were problematic.", "I am a woman!", "100% this! So well-worded. \n\nThis conflict reminded me of an example with my brother when he was little. He got bullied in early grade school a lot. One time he decided to retaliate and hit the kid back to get them to stop. The teacher thought **he** was bullying the **bully**, and called parents in for a discussion. My brother said he was defending himself, but our mom agreed with the teacher and grounded my brother for a while, &the other kid didn't get in trouble at all. He still got upset about it years later because as much as he tried to explain, our mom didnt believe him. He used to get mad at the teacher too, but realized at some point it was misdirected anger at our mom. He finally talked it out with her, but it ate at him for a while.\n\nThere's no way to say what truly happened in Ops post because it's so long ago, but it even may be that she's angry at how her parents acted after being told by the teacher, or frustrated at a perceived injustice, regardless of what actually happened. If you don't let things go, they can fester and actually grow bigger, so you blow them up to have more of an impact than they did, or act more angrily than you would otherwise. Op's conscientious apology was the right response, and there's not much else to be done for an event that she does not remember. It's up to the gf to take the apology from op and let the issue go, or continue to let it eat at her.", "Looks like she dug up more than just a grudge, she also found the excuse she was looking for.", "The way that Jessie was still upset throughout.

It sounds like you had good reason to write her up. Too bad you couldn't write her up for her obnoxious behavior as an adult.", "Look, *teachers* may have students best interests at heart, but schools don\u2019t. \n\nThere\u2019s bleed over from that, too. Something was up with this child. She was neurodivergent in some way. Based on the fact that she\u2019s a female, I\u2019d be willing to bet ADHD, ASD, or dyslexia- you have NO idea the biases females face when getting dx. \n\nShe OBVIOUSLY didn\u2019t need special Ed classes and the parents pulling her to homeschool was NOT the problem. Her current success speaks to that. I had to do the same exact thing about 15 years ago in order to get my now 19 year old the help she needed. \n\nThe fact that the parents couldn\u2019t get the school to listen, the fact that she wasn\u2019t getting proper support, the fact that she wasn\u2019t properly dx means that YOU took her actions as misbehavior and punished her for something she wasn\u2019t actually doing. \n\nYour school didn\u2019t have her best interests at heart and their failure of her colored how you interacted with and treated her. \n\nYou and your school and everyone\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d traumatized that child and irreparably harmed her. That\u2019s something that someone needs to take responsibility for but never will. She will never be validated for what she was put through as an innocent child. \n\nYou did the best you could with the info you had but it still wasn\u2019t good enough.

You didn\u2019t do it on purpose but you did.", "haha NTA. I have lingering beef with my kindergarten teacher \u2014 another kid in my class tried to SNATCH the glasses off my face so I instinctively hit him.

My teacher ONLY punished me and made me sit in the back of the classroom for a whole week.

Maybe you were an AH back then for being somewhat condescending or overly strict with Jessie. But JFC, it was in ELEMENTARY school and she's still holding a grudge?? What a petty idiot.", "NTA but what a weird way for her to show she's still mentally a toddler.  I've run into my old bully from elementary school and the conversation ended with both of us laughing about how stupid we both were back then. Why? Because we're not in second grade anymore and we don't need to keep acting like we are.", "> So you punished her by... informing her parents? That's not an unreasonable punishment. And if her parents were decent, they would have listened to her side of the story, spoken to her about how she needs to be respectful of others, how others need to be respectful of her and possibly followed up with you if they agreed that you had been unfair.\n\nExactly. Having parents sign a note informing them of their elementary student talking back should be such a non-issue. To hold that much anger over something like that this many years later is unhinged, imo. If her parents had a disproportionate reaction to it, that's entirely on them. It's understandable to be a little upset over a teacher making a mistake like that and unnecessarily getting you in trouble, but to be as angey as she is is just ridiculous.", "Editing your comment without acknowledging the edit or that you were wrong makes you just about as mature as the antagonist in this post. But do you...", "Some kindergarten teachers are the worst. Mine hated me because I didn\u2019t go to kindergarten round up. I had the flu and was running a fever and puking. I highly doubt the other parents would have been happy I was there but apparently she was insistent I come because it was important. She constantly yelled at me for being \u201chyper\u201d when I was acting like the other kids and refused to let me get a band-aide when I got a nasty paper cut that was bleeding a lot because \u201cit didn\u2019t need one\u201d. The paper towel I used as a band-aide had quite a bit of blood on it. Also the nurses office was right next to the classroom so\u2026.", "She sounds problematic. I'm guessing the homeschooling made her who she is today; with absolutely no resources or help, for whatever her problem was.", "some behavior by teachers is soooooooo overboard and unkind!!! I truly don\u2019t understand it. everyone has bad days, but when it becomes a pattern it\u2019s time to get a new job. like, you actually do not need to be out here bullying little kids lol"]}
