So you punished her by... informing her parents? That's not an unreasonable punishment.

OP should not be expected to remember one incident with a child she never had contact with again. That\u2019s ridiculous.  You are NTA but Jessie is for holding a ridiculous grudge for so long. She may not even remember the incident accurately. I\u2019m sorry but this whole situation sounds dumb, not because of OP but because Jessie can\u2019t just let it go. God help her if she holds grudges against everyone in her life who is perceived to have wronged her.", "NTA.  As a former teacher who has learning challenges, no disability requires her to be talking back to a teacher.", "I once bumped into my 5th grade teacher as an adult. I really didn\u2019t like that guy, he was a bully who forced me to hold a praying mantis even tho I was terrified (I\u2019m in my 50s and still terrified strangely enough) and I saw him squash an injured duck with a concrete slab to \u201cput it out of its misery\u201d, so definitely no happy memories, in fact I could easily add more negative ones as he was also our school bus driver for years. But when I bumped into him at the shops one day I was polite (and a little horrified that he recognised me without difficulty after 30 years \ud83e\udd23). \nNTA Jessie needs to deal with her hurt from this incident.", "bold of you to assume she as a child genuinely didn\u2019t understand why she was getting in trouble and was asking for clarification so she could understand why she was actually in trouble. believe it or not but it sure can happen (as in chances are it wasn\u2019t just a butt hurt child, especially considering her ADHD & Autism)", "An innocent remark is an innocent remark though, if someone reacts badly then that\u2019s them projecting their issues. The rest I can agree with, but innocent is innocent.", "thank you for introducing me to justice sensitivity and why i tend to get up in and about things wow\n\nrecently diagnosed adhd-er with difficulty not arguing when something is wrong :/"]}
