It sounds like you were disciplining a child who probably needed it and the child instead of accepting correction wanted to explain to you why you were wrong and why you were misunderstanding her. Emotionally well adjusted 28 year olds don't carry grudges about getting in trouble for talking back in elementary school. That's not a particularly serious infraction.", "NTA. Girlfriend sounds a wee bit unhinged to be bearing a grudge over a teacher's note for two decades.", "NTA, if you're speaking the truth. And you didn't even flip out. You kept apologizing for something which you \\*probably\\* didn't do. That makes you the bigger woman \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*^(Even if you're lying, it's very silly to hold a grudge anyway. I still don't think that the \"talking back\" thing should be an excuse to send a note.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Jessie seems like an asshole though*", "In life, we don't always realize how our words and actions can appear to others. So things we say innocently can be very hurtful to the person we are talking to. And miscommunication often is the \"fault\" of both parties.\n\nBut let's assume that she is completely right and you were 100% at fault: she made a perfectly innocent remark that you took it wildly out of context and scolded her for genuinely asking for help. So you punished her by... informing her parents? That's not an unreasonable punishment. And if her parents were decent, they would have listened to her side of the story, spoken to her about how she needs to be respectful of others, how others need to be respectful of her and possibly followed up with you if they agreed that you had been unfair.\n\nAt the end of the day, you didn't do it to be mean. You didn't continue to punish her for the rest of the school year. So the only thing you did wrong was the miscommunication, which you have now apologized for. I normally insist that--to be a true apology--one has to make restitution to the victim, but in this case, that would be simply telling her parents that you apparently made a mistake and shouldn't have sent home a note. Since she is no longer a child living at home with her parents, that isn't *necessary*, but since she's still upset, you could offer it...but beyond that, there's really nothing more you can do.\n\nIf she has further grievances with you (with *you* specifically, not with the school overall), she should tell you. \n\nBut while she has no obligation to accept your apology, that doesn't give her license to be rude to you now. So regardless of who was that fault for the original conflict, you are NTA now.", "NTA. You apologized for it and did the best you could with what you knew. It was on her parents for not taking diagnostics seriously when that could\u2019ve helped build a better relationship between her and the school.", "INFO: Your question is about how you responded, but the only thing I see here is you being honest and apologetic.

Unless you regular wrote kids up for \u201cfucking nothing\u201d than chances are she was acting up and still hasn\u2019t gained the maturity to realize she wasn\u2019t some poor out upon victim for being reasonably disciplined when she did so.", "ESH, I think. I will say that unfair situations concerning childhood teachers can have a lasting impact on someone\u2019s outcome in life/education and she feels bitter and simply hasn\u2019t forgotten it. She probably just needs time to sit with the realization, but I also don\u2019t think she handled it in the most mature way. I would offer some grace, because she probably feels that the hand she was dealt screwed up parts of her life in the long term (ie what she said, irreparable damage).", "NTA Tell Jessie to get over it and get it in her head that whatever happened didn't involve you. While you're at it tell her to grow up.", "ESH. The situation could've played out way better and in a more mature way (especially on her side). But I think you suck because you're seem quick to forget your wrongdoing, while remembering what everyone else thought of her when she was still at school.\n\nYou were standing up for yourself, but I understand why she is upset. Some teachers are mean, and they don't really care if their opinions are overly harsh or not at all based on facts, thereby destroying children's self-confidence. \n\nYes, I understand some children do need special education, but not all do (even if they need special education... they could have gone through trauma, or have depression etc. which ultimately leads to poor performance at school).", "[deleted]", "No way did a single note lead to homeschooling. Sounds like her parents were problematic.", "I am a woman!", "100% this! So well-worded. \n\nThis conflict reminded me of an example with my brother when he was little. He got bullied in early grade school a lot. One time he decided to retaliate and hit the kid back to get them to stop. The teacher thought **he** was bullying the **bully**, and called parents in for a discussion. My brother said he was defending himself, but our mom agreed with the teacher and grounded my brother for a while, &the other kid didn't get in trouble at all. He still got upset about it years later because as much as he tried to explain, our mom didnt believe him. He used to get mad at the teacher too, but realized at some point it was misdirected anger at our mom. He finally talked it out with her, but it ate at him for a while.\n\nThere's no way to say what truly happened in Ops post because it's so long ago, but it even may be that she's angry at how her parents acted after being told by the teacher, or frustrated at a perceived injustice, regardless of what actually happened. If you don't let things go, they can fester and actually grow bigger, so you blow them up to have more of an impact than they did, or act more angrily than you would otherwise. Op's conscientious apology was the right response, and there's not much else to be done for an event that she does not remember. It's up to the gf to take the apology from op and let the issue go, or continue to let it eat at her.", "Looks like she dug up more than just a grudge, she also found the excuse she was looking for.", "The way that Jessie was still upset throughout. I know young people these days are big on apologies and accountability. I also know how problematic the older generation can be and wasn\u2019t sure if I was displaying any of those problematic behaviors the younger generations seem to have with us", "This incident literally had nothing to do with special education classes, though? Or being a pushover? Did you read the post, at all? The girl's accusing op of a disciplinary write up, from several years ago.

NTA op", "She told us she was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD and that tracks given some of her behaviors back then and from how she behaved that night", "I disagree. How can you be a person when you hold grudges for so long?", "Or OP treated her like they would any other misbehaving child.", "So true. When someone says something mean, they forget about what they said fairly quickly, but the person on the receiving end of the comment may never forget it and always carry it with them.", "thanks", "Chances are she was talking back and just remembers things differently as kids often do. Perhaps she should take accountability for that.", "People can have ADHD and/or autism and still be high functioning. It's a real struggle if you have these diagnoses because people aren't supportive. And having these diagnoses doesn't always mean you need special education.", "You are a person whether you hold grudges or not...? Some people have a really hard time letting go of situations that happened that negatively affected their self-esteem.", "That's called a grudge", "I can't really relate to disabled people, so I can't speak any further. I might just be naive", "In many cases, harboring resentment (or grudges) happens when a person has the need to gain compassion or understanding they were not granted in the past.", "You \u2018can\u2019t really relate to disabled people\u2019?? The hell is wrong with you", "She probably had to get disciplined for her behavior. She might just be causing a lot of trouble in the class", "Maybe. OP did say she has ADHD and autism. But maybe it was undiagnosed back then, leading to everyone thinking she's stupid or something, when in reality, she just needed some compassion and help.", "Or she was doing things you often see in girls with undiagnosed ADHD like talking when they shouldn\u2019t in class, having impulsivity issues that lead to them talking back, etc. That\u2019s far more likely than her getting a note home because people thought she was dumb."]}
