They held to their rule and immediately called the police. There was a huge scene where he was arrested, and my daugher had to see the whole thing.\n\nI'm really angry. Yes, I know they had their rule, but they have to recognize reality. He was totally in the wrong to just show up, but what they did escalated the situation and traumatized a small child. They think they're in the right.

Possibly right now he has as much right as her to decide where she goes. That means this is a fraught time because if they disagree about where she goes, for example, if he's an unsafe person and mom wants to limit his involvement in her life, or if Dad is using the child to bring focus to himself and control mom's actions, he could use the child to manipulate mom into being around him more/catering to his wishes (such as refusing to allow the child to be babysat by safe people so he can limit where mom goes/does because she won't have access to babysitting). I think there is a lot of information missing for people to be making these harsh judgements, we don't really know the character of dad enough, why mom made the decisions she made, to understand what's going on here. I am sympathetic to people trying to leave an unhealthy marriage with a child, because oftentimes there is no right action- your child ties you to someone you gets a say even if they aren't always a safe or rational person.

The fact that he got arrested means that he was absolutely acting aggressive and refusing to go at the very least, or possibly had an outstanding warrant or a restraining order against him already. If he\u2019d just \u201ccome over to see his daughter\u201d and was acting normally but the friends didn\u2019t want him there, the police would have just told him to leave, he would not have been arrested. Op can\u2019t even mention what this guy has done because it violates sub rules, he\u2019s almost positively and abusive, dangerous man and was definitely displaying that behavior here, even just in the act of coming over. \n\nShe also almost definitely knows her father is like this, the lesson is not punishing her because her dad tried to see her like you seem to think, the lesson is that she now understands when people are acting abusive and scary, she allowed to stand up for herself and do something about it. She doesn\u2019t have to go with a man who is being aggressive and scary and trying to take her from the people babysitting her when he isn\u2019t supposed to. \n\nUnfortunately in this situation, it may not have been possible for one of the friends to step away to take her to another room, and trying to send her somewhere else doesn\u2019t always work.

I don\u2019t know why you seem to think just watching him get arrested is somehow the worst thing she\u2019s ever experienced that will scar her forever, there were already long lasting affects, she\u2019s in the very least watched her mother be abused, and was likely abused herself by the man who was literally trying to kidnap her.", "Here\u2019s what made me question if there is a slight possibility (I said slight as it does appear that she is a victim) that he could be more innocent than the story suggest.

Instead, from a comment she left, she is worried that by him getting arrested because it would hurt her court case. Why? That should help it\u2026unless of course she has done some psychological abuse to the father and took his daughter away. Any loving father would act like a crazy person to get his daughter back. The friends could just be afraid of him from what she told them about him. It\u2019s not unheard of for a spouse to paint a story that was false to get full custody of a child. So before people just think I\u2019m victim shaming, maybe I\u2019m just trying to see all angles. Maybe I understand that abuse is complicated and I totally understand the horrors woman go through especially when not believed.

I don\u2019t victim shame but in a case where it\u2019s someone worried if they are an asshole in a dangerous situation instead of their safety as well as their child\u2019s and also worried about how his arrest would hurt her in court as opposed to helping her, I still think there is a slight possibility we have all shamed him unnecessarily.

How would you have felt if they let her go and you never saw her again because dad didn't bring her back? \n\nYTA, and you owe your friends a massive apology.", "Good on you for getting out! We all make excuses for them, it\u2019s a matter of waking up and admitting when it\u2019s time to stop. Unconditional love does not mean unconditional acceptance of bad behavior.", "You should refrain from discussing things you don't know shit about.", "You are all over this thread with TERRIBLE legal advice. NO ONE listen to this person. They are pulling opinions out of their ass and calling them facts.", "All cops shoot people because they are black.  Sure.  Of course some do.  But not all.", "I think there needs to be some level of understanding and consideration when there's a child involved. He is her dad.", "I feel so awful for her though that neither parent cares to put her safety first.", "\u201cDon't even mention violence.\n\nIf your post or comment references violence, don't share it here. Any hint, mention, euphemism or suggestion of violence falls under this rule and isn't allowed.\u201d", "Police, they always do the right thing!  We barely know anything about the situation but OP is certainly an asshole for putting her friends in this position.  Bring your child with or don\u2019t go out of town during a custody battle.", "I don't know where you live, but in much of the US, without a custody agreement signed off on by a court system, both parents have equal rights to have the child with them. Yes, the mother has the right to have their child in childcare. The father also has the right to remove the child from whoever is caring for them if it's not the mother. \n\nI have literally heard of one parent taking the child during the divorce proceedings when custody had not yet been established, and failing to return the child, and the other parent parking in front of their apartment house for several weeks until the parent went out, leaving the child with a partner. The other parent was then able to get the police to force the partner to hand over the child.", "It would actually be preferable. Even when there isn\u2019t violence but the divorce is contentious, a neutral meeting point is so much better for everyone, especially the kids.", "I had completely normalised his behaviour. It was only once I got out that I looked back and saw how abusive he had been. Like you, I can sense what is probably the true story here.", "Not all.\nBut some do.\n\nSo why do you believe there are no cops who arrest people without knowing why?", "How do you know this?", "So you\u2019re willing to put your child in a dangerous situation with someone who\u2019s violent for the sake of blood? You\u2019re willing to risk your child being physically and emotionally harmed so that you can be considerate of his feelings? If so, that makes you a shit mom. You\u2019re showing her it\u2019s okay for men to treat women that way, that she is closer to property than a person with feelings and emotions. \n\nYou\u2019re loyalty is to protecting your child, not sparing her fathers feelings. Bad actions have consequences, and risking your child\u2019s safety should NEVER be an option. You are no better than him if you continue to entertain this. Your child deserves better. She deserves the type of protection your friends are willing to give her.", "How can you expect strangers to offer advice and judgement if you are leaving out important details?", "This comment disturbs me as someone who grew up with a violent father. Seeing him act the way he did was far worse than any police involvement. Actually, I wish the police had gotten involved at times because it would have saved me from more trauma, and this is coming from someone who does not trust cops. YTA.", "Did he have a level of understanding when he basically tried to take the child away from the people that were taking care of him/her.. Based on the fact that you didnt want you ex to baby sit his own kid im guessing there is pretty bad history. Would you have prefered them to just let him take the kid or him escalate the situation? Even the fact that they did arrest him has to tell you something about what was happening becauae police would have questioned your friends a lot and probably let the dad take the kid because hes the dad.", "The understanding and consideration should be for the kid!!!! Why are you letting your child being around an abuser just cause he is her dad, biology means nothing here. TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILD!!!", "And he\u2019s an abuser, who is definitely traumatizing your child way more than your friend who is trying to protect her. Maybe you should follow her lead.", "The \u201cunderstanding and consideration\u201d is them allowing you to live with them so you won\u2019t disrupt your young child\u2019s life more than it already has been.\n\nHe wants to see her? Meet him in a public place so he can spend time with her until a custody order is established.", "I think it\u2019s pretty clear this guy is an abuser. All the signs are here.  She\u2019s acting like a textbook abused woman with her excuses.  The police taking him away shows he was out of control.  If he was calmly standing there they would ask him to leave.\n\nETA - it\u2019s super easy to say the cops are bad and use that as a cop out.  All cops (even most) are not bad.", "Aha, notice \"parking in front of their appartment for several weeks\" and \"got the police to force the partner to hand over the child\" and not \"going into their apartment to get the child by force\".", "I agree. I am finally living in a home that my ex does not know the location of. 2 of my kids love on their own, and on the rare chance my youngest wants to see him, they meet at a neutral location. The most peace I have had in years."]}
