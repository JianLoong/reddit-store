They held to their rule and immediately called the police. There was a huge scene where he was arrested, and my daugher had to see the whole thing.\n\nI'm really angry. Yes, I know they had their rule, but they have to recognize reality. He was totally in the wrong to just show up, but what they did escalated the situation and traumatized a small child. They think they're in the right.

You\u2019re avoiding the question here.", "Was he abusive?", "Do they hate him just because he\u2019s your ex? Because of issues between them that have nothing to do with you? Has he caused them harm?\n\nWe can\u2019t judge this with no information. If the issue is just that your husband and your friends like rival sports teams or something, they are obviously being way over the top. If the issue is a history of illegal/dangerous behavior and they have a reasonable concern about him harming them/you/your daughter/their property, then they did exactly the right thing.", "1. but maybe they are strangers to him\n\n2. so? Maybe OP is the bad in the story or her friends are addics \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n3. The father has more right to see his child than random friends of the mother\n\n4. Yes thats their right. But the policemen should have handle it correctly", "Or about her behavior. She told in an other comment, that the child was not in her care at this date.", "Fair. I think it\u2019d be natural for her to be upset but there should be no blame on the housemates since they warned her", "She\u2019s been avoiding the question from so many people but has been responding to most every other one, seems pretty obvious she\u2019s leaving some integral parts of this story out.", "OP is making all sorts of excuses for this man.  Its kind of ridiculous", "If there\u2019s no custody agreement she can\u2019t unilaterally leave their child with someone else and forbid the father from picking the child up.  Reddit law is in full force in this thread and it\u2019s pathetic.  Ex could conceivably use this as proof of bad conduct on OP\u2019s part in their custody battle you absolute fools.", "Depends on the country where OP lives.\n\nFor example in the USA cops are not trained good so there this could happen.\n\nOP mentioned that she was not in care of the child at this day but the cops didnt checked it and left the child at the house.", "I completely agree with you. If he is dangerous they were right but if they just don't like him then I'm asking myself why OP lives there if he has to come to that place at some point.", "Maybe the policemen did.", "Why do you assume op is the one with a behavior problem. The fact that the ex didn\u2019t leave at the threat of the police and that the police arrested him says a lot more about his behavior that op\u2019s", "Exactly. As a person who has an abusive ex, her friends have a great point. And you can definitely navigate custody without him coming to the house. I was able to.", "Why would he ever have to come there? OP can always meet him at a neutral location.", "But as we know they did not", "We don\u2019t have enough info to determine this.  For all you know the ex was rightfully angry that strangers were keeping his son from him.  This sub just loves to assume the worst about men reflexively.", "I think it actually was because of the kid. But I don't know tbh maybe because they don't want to talk in public about the divorce. And I can imagine since the OP doesn't really answer why they hate the ex so much that she doesn't want to go to his house."]}
