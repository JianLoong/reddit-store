While we didn't want to part with these items, I was hoping they would cut the costs for her expenses and help make her new apartment a home as she has 2 toddlers.\n\nOn Sunday night we coordinated a time for her to pick up the items. She decided on Monday at 2pm. We made it clear we had neighbors coming over for dinner and it was imperative she was on time.
