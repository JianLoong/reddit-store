I.e. you\u2019re going hungry because they didn\u2019t save you any food. This isn\u2019t a situation of some whiny kid who could just go make themselves a sandwich or order in with their own money. You\u2019re being starved because your husband was too selfish to make sure you were saved some dinner. NTA, but you should look into resources to help you leave.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of family doesn't save a plate for the hungry and tired one? How cruel.", "NTA. How difficult would it have been for the family to save OP a plate? From all the YTA comments, I\u2019m worried about your families only caring for themselves, saving a plate is the most basic of manners when you care about people.", "Nta.....like wtf, can't even set you a plate aside? How rude. Edit to add......next time you cook, don't make them any then act shocked they wanted to eat.", "It seems that your financial situation is tricky - from the comments (would have been better to include in the post that you are the mother, the one who made a dinner and that you don't have money to splurge on overly big appetites of your family members) which justifies your frustration over being forgotten. \nNTA. But make sure to discuss the issue, calmly showing your perspective once you calm down.", "NTA, WTF REDDIT!!!!!!.People are allowed to over sleep past dinner time, any loving family would have left a plate, my family pretty much always did. OP your feelings are a 110% valid and I'm smart enough to tell that this not simply an isolated incident but a straw that broke thr camel's back of incidents by your family that made you feel like you don't matter. You matter and so is your feelings and at the very minimum you should to your family. I recommend to figure out how to GTFO once you become an adult that can be semi-comfortably independent otherwise being around your family might be self-destructive in the future in my opinion", "NTA. \n\nEven if you were a whiny kid, I would still say NTA - you asked to be woken up.\n\nYou regularly go without food and can\u2019t just make or go buy more food. Your husband is a huge asshole.", "I can\u2019t stand the thought of anyone going without a meal. Maybe set an alarm next time. Are there food banks in your area? My city has a meal and food bank calendar. I hope things improve for you. Take care. Definitely NTA", "NTA, I hate to say it, but your family lacks manners, empathy, and respect toward you. Wait, maybe I should ask if you live with wolves first; if so, it is the rule of the wild. If not, then what happened to the action of shaking someone awake? Are we sure they even knocked on the door at this point? I don't know your role in this family, but it reminds me of this comedian my grandfather and dad used to watch when I was a kid. \"You get no respect. I tell you no respect.\"", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to be angry", "NTA. My family was never in that kind of crisis, at least not by the time I came along, though my dad grew up very, very poor. My folks are both long gone now, but I know \ud83d\udcaf my dad would have gone without before he let my mom or any of his kids go to bed hungry.", "NTA. You made the food and they didn\u2019t save you any?? Did you explain how hurt and hungry you are? Don\u2019t let this slide without addressing it. I think it\u2019s more of a husband problem though, kids are generally thoughtful enough to not let their mom starve, I am guessing he encouraged them to eat everything, and if not and they all did it on their own that\u2019s a bigger problem.", "I mean, NTA but\n\n>to feel like nobody cares if I live or die\n\nThat seems a bit melodramatic don't you think?  There's a far cry from 'forgot to save a plate' and 'doesn't care if you die'.", "YTA\n\n> am I right to feel like nobody cares if I live or die?\n\nCan you feed yourself on hyperbole?\n\nThey knocked, you didn't get up. You want something now that it's not dinner any longer, feel free to make something.", "You slept through the knock. Clearly more tired than hungry. They tried. \n\nIt's one meal, you'll live.  Or maybe just make yourself something now that you're up.", "nta for being upset that they didn't save you anything\n\nyta for how you are responding to people's input.\n\nthe way that you wrote your post was dramatic, and your responses were aggressive, rude, and disrespectful. you should not post here if you don't actually want other people's input. the reason that people say that you are TA is because you don't give much context to your situation, and since it is so dramatic with nothing to back it up, to people unfamiliar with your situation, you sounded like a teenager with an anger problem.\n\ni understand your frustrations, i do. however, you are taking them out on the wrong people and in the wrong way.", "YTA lol not their fault you missed dinner. Make youself smething", "YTA\n\nThis is peak drama. \n\nUnless you\u2019re in a critical situation, which is doubtful seeing as you posted on Reddit, you\u2019re not going to die. \n\nGo make yourself some food. Your \u201changer\u201d is making you irrational.", "They tried to wake you YTA and dramatic af", "Seems a bit dramatic, don't you think?  Surely you found some other food.  And apparently you survived long enough to post on AITA.  YTA.", "Just how old are you? If no dinner left make scrambled eggs.", "Maybe you can just go for a swim in the pool you were writing about 10 days ago in r/pools.", "ESH, yes they're AHs for not saving you some, then again if they ate it all with no leftovers then there wasn't enough to begin with. But the thing that makes you the AH too is the overdramatic \"am I right to feel like nobody cares if I live or die?\" part, sounds like there's a lot of long term resentment you've built up and this isn't really just about dinner, and if it is that's even worse.", "NTA but possibly a tiny bit overdramatic.  It was very rude of them to eat everything and leave you nothing..  your options are to make something else. Go buy fast food, or order pizza delivered just for yourself.  UberEATS is also an option.  I'd be willing to bet this sinerio would not happen again if you are pizza in front of them and offered them none since they already ate.  Also, they would not want to die. Who would clean up the mess afterwards?", "INFO: have you a medical condition that makes it dangerous for you to miss a meal? \n\nIf yes, then NTA unless you also have a condition that prevents you from making a sandwich. \n\nIf no, then YTA for presuming you are the main character.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wasn't being a brat I was simply gaslighted into thinking I was. Never understood how Dysfunctional and narcissistic my family was until I hit my late twenties. \n\nIt is not a good experience to be gaslighted as a young person when the parents are obviously the problem, you probably should give posts like this the benefit of the doubt from now on instead of being potentially a part of a bigger problem", "We\u2019re just regular white people", "Correct.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \n\nMy family was verbally and emotionally abusive.
