Don't you think it will hurt your stepdaughter to take your daughter to events and not to take her to hers? This could be something to think about more carefully.\n\nI don't think YWBTA but it may be worth talking to your stepdaughter about it and asking whether she wants to switch, so she doesn't think you're favouring your daughter over her by putting her in a 'better' studio.

Are they really going to be upset if either one of their schools wins the respective age category? Yeah sure they may get upset if they lose, but chances are they'd get upset regardless of what school they lost to. \n\nAnd since this school Miley is in is incredibly intense and full on, theres a decent chance that Miley and Lux may be compared against each other. I can see comments like \"Oh, when Miley was your age she could do ___ perfectly\" or \"oh, Lux is so much better than you at __ and she's a lot younger than you\" happening in an attempt to push the kid harder.", "The daughter is four, she\u2019ll answer whatever.

You can even break it down to, the \"other\" school is for beginners and when she's older Ya'll can re-evaluate and see if she even wants to go to the same school as her sister once she's old enough and IF she wants to be competitive.\n\nThis allows you to have your daughter go to the school you went to, \"just like mommy\" and she gets to do it for fun and then when and only IF she is willing can go to a more competitive school like her sister.\n\nThe ex-wife should have no say so in where you send your daughter to.

You explain to the children the parents can't be at both, so 1 goes to step daughter and 1 goes to bio daughter, and then next time, you switch.  This way both kids get a parent and it's not showing any favoritism. \n\nYou communicate with your kids and explain what's going on and you give them options to make a decision.  Does mommy go with step or bio this time or next time?  The kids can discuss and make a decision. And if he brings up that Step isn't mommys kid and daddy should be at every one of step's performance and not mommy, then he's playing favoritism and making sure his daughter knows his wife isn't really someone she has to listen to / respect.", "This is why my kid isn't going to my friend's studio.

The ex doesn\u2019t need to be involved so I would definitely shut that shit down now. I would tell your husband when it comes to your daughter you do not coparent  with his ex. Her options are not wanted not needed on where you send your child.\n\nSecondly since he seems to be not listening to you it may be time to be brutally honest. Tell him that he and his ex may be ok with the skimpy costumes that step daughters studio makes mandatory your not. You didn\u2019t say anything because it was never any of your business unlike the ex you know how to stay in your lane. Also tell him at this age you want it to be about learning how to dance and not how to be competitive. \n\nThen I would say that if their daughter is so competitive that it ruins a relationship with her sister over a dance competition then they have failed as parents. The but winning over family. \n\n\nIs it me or was there recently a big sporting event that pitted 2 brothers against each other that actually get paid big money in this event. Hum? \nSo my point is they would not be the first pair of siblings competing against each other. \n\nI see far more problems if you put them in the same studio. Especially as they get older. The older may feel the younger daughter is copying her and trying to take attention away from her. And what if the other one becomes better? On the same studio they would constantly get compared. Like sister a can do this why can\u2019t you. Or sister b is so much better at this?", "NTA they just want you to be the future driver of the girls.  \nI think it s a logistic point of you from them. \nI don t see anything else, by the way your daughter is her own person, they shouldn t expect her to do the same thing as her sister or there will be some jealousy and competion.", " NTA. Why would a 12 year old feel competitive with a 4 yr old unless they are pitched against each other? I'd assume there would be more competition in the same school, to be honest, where your 4 yr old would be compared to the 12 yr old.\n\nThis is a super weird thing to push you to do.", "NAH - I can see both sides. I don't think either of you are wrong.\n\nInfo: Will DH need to transport daughter to classes? If so I can understand them wanting to be at the same place because it is easier than having to drive to two different locations.\n\nEx does have a point about possibly having to miss competitions. Just because oldest daughter will be 16 doesn't mean she and her parents want to miss her competitions either. It will put ex in a hard position having to choose between both kids which is not ideal for anyone as someone will be hurt.\n\nAdditionally, do they have a year end recital? Most are on similar weekends so it can cause him to miss one of his daughter's performances.\n\nI get your thought also that you just want something special for your daughter and don't want to pressure her for competitions. This is all valid.\n\nSome thoughts. Would having the two girls at the same studio be any kind of a bonding experience for them? I remember we use to have the older classes volunteer and help with the younger class and it was a great experience for all around. Maybe having them together will bring them closer?\n\nThis is something that should be mutually agreed upon. Hopefully, you both can come to a compromise that is in the best interest of the child. I know that is not easy when emotions are involved because to one it may feel like an attack on their character if they disagree with the other.\n\nGood luck and I am sure daughter will enjoy dance no matter which location she goes to\n\nedited because I originally thought DH was ex.", "they\u2019re so far apart in age?? idk what your husband\u2019s or husband\u2019s family\u2019s problem is but your daughter is 4 and won\u2019t actually be competing for four years and certainly wouldn\u2019t compete against her half-sister who is EIGHT YEARS OLDER. idk what they\u2019re on, but you sound reasonable to me", "Go to the dance studio that you worked for because that will be best for your daughter.

Most kids aren't on track to become professional or Olympic athletes/dancers/cheerleaders. Most kids want exactly what participation provides, opportunities to learn and practice physical skills that may lead to similar hobbies or activities in their healthy balanced adult lives.

They manage and hubby can too. \n\nPlus having them at separate studios allows your stepdaughter to keep this as her thing.
