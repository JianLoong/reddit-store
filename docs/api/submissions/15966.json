You know the studio is super competitive and you do t want that for your daughter.

In 4 years your daughter might not even like dance anymore, Miley might have found something else. It\u2019s honestly a bit insane worrying about the future dance competitions of your kindergartener. Beside when would an 8 year old compete against a 16 year old??? I think it\u2019s one of those instances in which people feel attacked when you refuse to take their same choices. Maybe they feel judged because they have pushed their girl into the competitive side of dancing?", " NTA they are not going to be competing with each other the age gap is too big.

As in he can't go to one because the other has also a dance thing at the same time and day ?", "NTA. You have given a range of reasons which show you have thought carefully about this.

There's no need to force her to the other one because you think that the atmosphere there will make your kid dislike dancing \n\n- You don't even know if she will dance for a month, a year or her whole life, you just want her to have fun and find out what she wants/likes\n\n- Your husband's ex has no say in which studio you choose and clearly your husband is wrong for involving her\n\n- The age gap between the girls excludes the possibility for them to compete against each other\n\n- The only possible problem would be for them having to go to classes at the same time - well, that's why it's good your stepdaughter's mother seems so concerned = she can take her there when your husband's busy.\n\n- You cannot put your daughter on hold every time her stuff might interfere with what your husband or his ex think will impact their daughter.\n\nForcing the girls to spend time together isn't a good idea.\n\nForcing the youngest one to do only what might not upset the oldest one isn't a good solution.\n\nWe're not talking here about being rude, disrespectful.\n\nWe're talking about a hobby (in your daughter's case, even a possible one) while your stepdaughter has the dance as an important part of her life.\n\nThe last thing i want to point out is that nowhere in your story i see anyone talking about what your oldest wants.\n\nHer mother seems preocupied of what if they will compete in 4 years.\n\nNowhere says: the stepdaughter loves dancing, she isn't force to dance to satisfy her parents'ego.\n\nHonestly i wonder if your oldest would rather quit that atmosphere and try and dance for herself, instead of dancing for her parents.\n\nHas anyone asked the oldest daughter what she wants?\n\nDoes anyone care about her feelings?\n\nI don't know why but i think you saw something that makes you think the oldest isn't as happy there as her parents would.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nThe girls will only see it as a competition if the parents/adults frame it as such.\n\nI doubt a kid cares that her toddler sibling's dance studio is competing too.

This would be a massive dealbreaker for me.", "NAH\n\nYou and your husband are seriously overthinking the possibility of competitiveness between them with that age gap. Your connection to another dance studio is a valid reason to send your daughter there. I think the best thing to do would be to make your decision primarily based on whether or not you want your daughter to compete. I danced throughout my childhood and none of the dance studios I went to were competitive or sent dancers to outside competitions. We just had recitals. I absolutely loved it and I am very grateful to have been able to enjoy dance as a cooperative activity where my friends and I were working together to give the best group performance. I think that was probably a huge factor in the positive environment I experienced and it made it easier for me to keep dancing as a hobby as an adult without feeling like I had to be the best or win anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dance schools where I live all do an end of year recital involving all students at the school so would you have to choose which daughter to support?", "Nta I feel like you have some very valid reasons and besides they are more likely to have an unhealthy competition dancing in the same studio. Your stepdaughter could even resent your daughter as this is something that is hers Just something to think about", "NTA - you have ties to the school you want your daughter to go to. \n\nMy two children did karate - at different clubs, for the main reason that I didn\u2019t want my second child to be in the shadow of my first (who is very good)\u2026 my kids never ever worried about competing against each other. They\u2019re in different age groups and wouldn\u2019t be up against each other anyway. \n\nI think it\u2019s healthy to give kids their own space to thrive in! If you can you should!!", "NTA\n\nSounds like a pain to do both but if you really care about the specific studio for your daughter they are 8 years apart meaning they aren\u2019t competitors. If you care about specific studio I don\u2019t think it makes a big difference other than you taking them different places so I say go for it. It\u2019s not like they are they same age competing against each other so I don\u2019t really see the issue", "This whole thing is so premature. Other than all the valid reasons you\u2019ve listed, who even knows if either one will still want to continue with dance by the time Lux starts competing? And you\u2019re right, Miley should be mature enough not to see an eight year old as competition when she\u2019s sixteen. Instead of parenting their kid they\u2019re just wanting you to bend to their will. They haven\u2019t given you a single good reason not to enrol your daughter at the other dance studio. NTA", "you know what I noticed in this whole post, guess who's opinions are missing the kids! ask your step daughter if this is something she'd have a issue with , she says she would have no issue problem solved!", "That's far too big as age gap for them to get competitive against each other\n\nI just want to go back to your comment in which you countered the potential problem of needing to go to events at the different studios on the same date. Don't you think it will hurt your stepdaughter to take your daughter to events and not to take her to hers? This could be something to think about more carefully.\n\nI don't think YWBTA but it may be worth talking to your stepdaughter about it and asking whether she wants to switch, so she doesn't think you're favouring your daughter over her by putting her in a 'better' studio. (I'm not saying it's better I'm pointing out potential perception on stepdaughter's part)", "Different studios, solely for the sluty clothes. Serious, these clothes for a 4yo?\n\nPlus, I'm sure two siblings in the same *highly competitive* studio is more likely to cause a competition than 2 differend studios of which one is far more lax.\n\nYWNBTA", "NAH - I think it\u2019s great that Dad contemplates potential issues that can arise from this, but I also agree that it sounds unlikely since they are two very different dance schools.", "Soft YTA. While I understand why you prefer one dance studio, two siblings competing against each other is a recipe for disaster. Miley would absolutely be impacted by the competition at 16, especially as it sounds like the studios encourage it. \n\nYour husband and Miley\u2019s mom are uncomfortable with this. I would respect their wishes.", "Who cares?", "It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want the limelight taken away from his daughter.", "I know right. This whole competitiveness thing is just the dumbest reason. You should be teaching your kids not to compare themselves/their skills to other people, to the point you start resenting someone.\n\nThey won't even be competing against each other since they're in different divisions. Are they really going to be upset if either one of their schools wins the respective age category? Yeah sure they may get upset if they lose, but chances are they'd get upset regardless of what school they lost to. \n\nAnd since this school Miley is in is incredibly intense and full on, theres a decent chance that Miley and Lux may be compared against each other. I can see comments like \"Oh, when Miley was your age she could do ___ perfectly\" or \"oh, Lux is so much better than you at __ and she's a lot younger than you\" happening in an attempt to push the kid harder.", "The daughter is four, she\u2019ll answer whatever. If mom is going to bring the daughter, I think she should use \u2018her\u2019 studio, where she has connections.", "NTA. Talk with the step daughter and see if she even has an opinion on where her little sister goes and if she would be competitive with her.\n\nI was ready to say op was TA just reading title (thinking the step daughter gets in a shitty school and bio daughter gets a nice expensive one, I assumed wrong) but after reading the thought process, the husband is TA esp since he wasn't getting his way, he brought in someone that would back him up.\n\nAll the reasons the OP brought up are great reasons to send her to a different school.  You can even break it down to, the \"other\" school is for beginners and when she's older Ya'll can re-evaluate and see if she even wants to go to the same school as her sister once she's old enough and IF she wants to be competitive.\n\nThis allows you to have your daughter go to the school you went to, \"just like mommy\" and she gets to do it for fun and then when and only IF she is willing can go to a more competitive school like her sister.\n\nThe ex-wife should have no say so in where you send your daughter to.  It's not fair that she got to choose where her daughter goes to school and as a mother, with a history in dance, don't get to choose for your own daughter.", "Even if he is worried about that, I think it's way too early to be worrying. She's 4. She may not even like dance, let alone want to put in the hours necessary to compete. Let her have fun! If she does want to compete, that's 4 years from now, and who knows what Miley's going to be doing? She may choose to drop dance entirely.", "He can do what every other parent that has 2+ children in activities where they overlap.  You explain to the children the parents can't be at both, so 1 goes to step daughter and 1 goes to bio daughter, and then next time, you switch.  This way both kids get a parent and it's not showing any favoritism. \n\nYou communicate with your kids and explain what's going on and you give them options to make a decision.  Does mommy go with step or bio this time or next time?  The kids can discuss and make a decision. And if he brings up that Step isn't mommys kid and daddy should be at every one of step's performance and not mommy, then he's playing favoritism and making sure his daughter knows his wife isn't really someone she has to listen to / respect.", "This is why my kid isn't going to my friend's studio. I don't want that for him, either.", "The siblings would never really compete against one another, though. Miley will be senior by the time Lux is a mini. Two completely different age groups. Lux may not even want to compete. And Miley could decide to quit dance entirely.", "The chance of a four-year-old and a twelve-year-old (or 8 and 16) competing against each other are miniscule."]}
