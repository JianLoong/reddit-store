Better call and Uber.\n\nLock your computer with a strong PW.  Nope, no one but me is suing my computer.\n\nHmmmm, my budget only lets me feed myself.  You\u2019ll need to go get groceries or order in food. \n\nl Great to see you Cousin\u2026. What hotel are you staying in?  Did you rent a car or will you be using Uber?", "NTA for the pc alone. I\u2019d someone even touched mine when I wasn\u2019t around they\u2019d never be allowed in that room again", "I'd need more information on \"constantly shutting down his plans\" to say, but if you mean \"he asks me to take him somewhere and I say no\", that's definitely not unreasonable.\n\nOverall, I'd say NTA.\n\nHe's got a dual-income house and, while I can't speak  to or assume their finances, at the end of the day it's irrelevant. He's a grown man. Part of adulting is learning how to get around on your own. Sure, it's nice when someone can do it for free, but the last minute notices aren't okay. These are things that should be planned in advance. It's only considerate to do so. (Outside of emergencies, of course.)\n\nAnd tbh you're nicer than I would be if I found someone just taking free reign of my computer. I'd ban them from it for Iife. It's YOUR computer. He needs to get his own and respect your personal belongings. Absolutely NTA.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Establish boundaries, then keep them in place. Eventually he will get the idea. Until then, he can rent a damn car to get around.", "NTA. No matter the tax bracket, moochers gonna mooch", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He could have rented it longer as he was in town for a week before the funeral. My computer is my most expensive property and has very important documents on it with family stuff as while.  If he had stayed at my place, he would have had better access to public transit.", "He\u2019d ask me to take him to a big mall outside of town, it\u2019s a 35 minute drive one way without traffic also asked me to drive him to a dinosaur museum that\u2019s 2 hours away when I got off work even though he knew I worked early mornings the next day. He also constantly changed his plans like driving to the next city over", "He definitely has the money to rent a car, he has been to Europe 3 times already this year, each time for 3+ weeks", "Wow. Definitely NTA. That's insane. You should tell him that if he wants to treat you like his personal chauffeur, he needs to pay you like it.", "Ugh! Then he could definitely pay for an Uber.", "In our family, it\u2019s kinda expected to give gas money if you ask for a ride, not like a lot of money but something that helps cover gas", "Yeah, not good enough in this case. You're investing more than just an occasional trip or hour. That's a lot of time and effort on your part. There's also wear and tear on the car to consider. Put the fear of Uber prices into him, and maybe he'll start to respect how much he's asking of you."]}
