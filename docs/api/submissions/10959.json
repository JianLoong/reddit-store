She is pretty self conscious about her looks. When she was about 12-13, I would often take photos of her which she would bicker with me about because they she apparently looked ugly in them and even went to the extent of crying about it, telling me to not take photos of her which was very controlling and selfish of her. I uploaded some of those photos to my instagram because I liked them. Some of her classmates follow me on there. When she found out, she asked me to either remove them as followers or to take those photos down because they were embarrassing and she didn't want her classmates to see them. I stormed out of the room because it's my social media account and I don't tell her what she can and cannot post on her account, so why should she be able to dictate what or who I have on there? Besides they probably saw them anyway. Her behaviour was extremely controlling. She told me that she has a say in this because she's in those photos.

It's selfish and controlling of her????\nKnowing how upset she is about it, what do you hope to achieve by keeping posting pictures of her on Insta?\nYour lack of empathy is staggering. \n\nDon't you remember what it's like to be a self conscious teenager?", "Please look up the definition of \"controlling\". YTA", "YTA and I\u2019m genuinely considering this not being real since the way you are talking makes you sound like the 15 year old. She\u2019s allowed to not want pictures of herself on the internet, and you doing so without her consent and then doubling down when she asks you to take them down is terrible. So either you are actually her mother and so incredibly immature or you are also 15 and this is maybe about a friend and you\u2019ve changed some details thinking it would make you less of an AH. Take the pictures down.", "So you\u2019re posting pictures of someone online without their consent?  And a minor at that?  It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your child, that\u2019s not ok.

You write like a 13 year old not a mother.", "YTA.\n\nI read your last post too. Genuinely, can I recommend you speak to a therapist? You're doing an awful lot of boundary stomping and seem to have genuine trouble recognising that your daughter has feelings that are valid.", "If this is real, YTA. The photos are of her and she's embarrassed about them. Therefore they are embarrassing photos. She gets to decide that. \n\nPosting photos of others that they ask you not to post, for whatever reason, is asshole behavior.", "YTA\n\nYou behaved like an absolute child. Your daughter has every right to have agency over photos of her being posted on social media without her consent.", "YTA!!! At 1st I thought regular asshole until I saw you called them selfish for trying to control their own bodily autonomy.  Nah. Super asshole.", "Wow, you sound like a grade a asshole, your daughter told you to not take any pictures of her when she was younger because she felt insecure about the way she looked and you went ahead to posted the pictures anyway because you \u2018liked them\u2019. And when she asked you against to take the pictures down because her classmates will see them (I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll be bullied) you just storm out of the room like a toddler. YTA op", "Are you the 15 year old? \n\nEither way you're hella immature. YTA.", "YTA, and you are the one being selfish and controlling.

You have all the right to control whether or not you want your image out there on the internet. She may not be the boss of your social media, but she is of her public image. \n\nAlso, you sound like a vapid teenager, throwing a tantrum and storming out of the room instead of reasonably discussing it like an adult.", "YTA.  They're photos of HER.", "As the adult in the situation it is cringey as hell that you stormed off and acted like a brat. Your child is not an accessory or a purse, she is human being who should be able to let you know she feels uncomfortable having photos posted of her.\n\nGrow up, YTA", "YTA. You are giving the wrong example by using her photos, not only without consent, but with them explicitly asking not to do it. She is right, she has a say in it.", "Yta...how would you feel if someone posted photos of you online without your consent ...how do you know that those classmates of hers aren't following you to get screenshots of the photos to pass around the class and bully her... obviously something has been said about it at school if she is so insistent that you remove them from your followers or remove the photos...\n\nIf you want the photos so badly on Instagram,make a second Instagram that is private and just for you, her and close family and put the photos there,\n\nYou sound more like the kid than the parent with the way you phrased the whole post", "YTA, you've got to be kidding me. \"Stormed out\" \"It's my social media account\" \"Extremely controlling\". Are you an adult?? Take down the photos, and get her into counseling. Then grow up and be a parent.", "YTA. Selfish and controlling? They\u2019re pictures of HER, she\u2019s old enough to decide her own presence on social media.

Do what she asked of you, either remove the pictures or remove her friends as followers.", "YTA. Those are photographs of *her* that she's ask you not to post. No only are you giving fuel for bullies to use, you're also collapsing the relationship you have with her. It's one thing if you want them up in your bedroom where you can privately see them but it's another to force your daughter into the public eye and, knowingly or not, humiliate her.\n\nAgain, those are photos of *HER* so yeah, she actually has a point. You can post what you like but posting photos of other people without their permission is illegal in some places and makes you A MASSIVE AH for not taking them down.\n\nIf this is the hill you want to die on then you don't deserve a relationship with your daughter. And that's what you're risking by not taking them down.", "Wait, are you sure that you aren't 15. I mean, you're throwing a tantrum.  You may have taken the photos, and you may think she looks cute in them, but clearly, she isn't comfortable with them.  You even say she is self-conscious, so why would you add to her anxiety? I take pictures of my mom that she doesn't like because of personal reasons. I love them. I think they're the best, but when she asks me not to post them? You know what I do? I don't run away and throw a tantrum like a child. No, I respect my mother, and I don't post them. \n\nYTA-grow up", "YTA \n\nHow hard is it to respect someone saying \u201cThat makes me uncomfortable please remove them\u201d?\n\nHow is the 15 year old the most mature person in this story?", "It isn\u2019t \u201ccontrolling\u201d to not want one\u2019s picture taken.

Remove the photos. You are teaching her that she cannot trust you. Social media is public and she deserves her privacy. \n\nI\u2019m disgusted that you need to be told this. Keep the photos for yourself if you want them so bad but **respect her wishes for privacy and delete them from Instagram.**", "YTA. A huge one. If she doesn't want photos of her on your Instagram, then don't post them.\n\nIt's as simple as that. Respect her wishes. You don't have ANY right posting pictures online when the person asks you not to.", "Yeah I\u2019m going to call bullshit on this post, you can\u2019t be that stupid to think you\u2019re in the right here.", "YTA and you're also not the adult in this relationship", "\u2026 are you the daughter?

Respect her digital footprint and personal boundaries regarding what is posted about her online. It's basic respect, that you're severely lacking.", "YTA - Are you really an adult?

And very selfish and inconsiderate of you towards your daughter.", "YTA do you really not understand who is controlling in this story?!", "Is this a joke?\n\nIf not: YTA all the way\n\nShe has every right not to want anyone, including her mother, taking pictures of her and/or uploading pictures of her to social platforms.\n\nYou seem to not know what controlling means, her behaviour isn\u2019t controlling, she just has boundaries. Would you call someone who doesn\u2019t want to be touched by someone controlling as well?

YTA.", "I have this exact same situation with both of my parents and it is extremely saddening to know that they\u2019d rather chose a few likes and comments over the respect of my privacy, and that it doesn\u2019t even matter that I hate and don\u2019t want the embarrassing posts of myself shown, only that they like them so they\u2019re gonna post them anyway.

YTA.\n\nif someone else did that to your daughter, you'd be all over them (i hope) for bullying your daughter.\n\nI hope I can find your daughter's insta, i will DM her to tell her to take unflattering photos of you and plaster it all over social media accessible to the public.", "YTA. You're the controlling party, not her. You have no respect for your daughter as an individual and you don't have a healthy respect for boundaries. \n\nYou're on a path that will have long-term negative impact on your relationship with your child if you don't start acknowledging her feelings. \n\nShe's not an object. She's a person with feelings that need to be respected. \n\nIf she has issues with accepting her appearance try a different approach that won't traumatize her. This isn't a loving, understanding approach and you're not building a safe space for her to open up and grow.", "Yta. In my opinion, children are allowed autonomy and have a right to decide which pictures of themselves live in social media forever - just as much as an adult does. As a parent to stripe them of that means you\u2019re treating your daughter like your possession and not a person. You\u2019re also teaching her that you don\u2019t care about her feelings unless you agree with them making you an unsafe person in her life. \n\nAlso posting pictures of your kids on social media is dangerous these days.\n\nPlus your lack of compassion towards your daughter and you projecting that she is selfish and controlling while you actually are is disgusting. This is terrible parenting and you\u2019re damaging your relationship. \n\nFrankly if I was your daughter I\u2019d take extremely unflattering photos of you and post them on my social media since by your own admission- you think that people own their own social media, and can post any content they want on their of others.", "Is this a joke? Obviously YTA. If she doesn't want those photos of herself online then you should delete them. No one is telling you to delete them from your phone, just don't post them onto a public forum where her peers follow you. Kids can be cruel.", "YTA. You \u2018stormed out of the room\u2019 cause she\u2019s not the boss of your social media?

When you were 15 would you have wanted anyone sharing photos of you that you didn't like with your classmates?", "YTA - the end.", "YTA. Your daughter has a right to have a say in her online presence. Can't you keep the photos somewhere private where only you can view them?", "YTA.  You sound like the child in this relationship", "Not sure this isn't a creative writing exercise (few people describe themselves as storming out of a room), but in the chance it isn't - YTA.\n\nYou're the parent.  Your job is to prepare your kid to be an adult and to provide a safe structure in which that happens.  Good parents do that through modeling good behavior, teaching proactively how to handle issues and then correcting as needed.  You're doing none of those things and instead acting like a petulant child yourself.\n\nDo you want your daughter to feel self conscious and uncomfortable?  Is posting something that makes her feel that way reasonable and something you'd insist on?  Do you want to set the example of ignoring other people's feelings and inflaming conflict or would you rather model problem solving?  \n\nSure, you can probably force things and get your way here.  But at what long term cost?", "You sound like you model your mom life off of Amy Poehler\u2019s character in Mean Girls. For the love of God, take the pictures down, don\u2019t let teenagers follow you (and definitely don\u2019t follow them), and respect your daughter\u2019s wishes. She\u2019s not controlling, she\u2019s asking you to respect her boundaries.

Your daughter deserves control over her own image and how it is used publicly. It isn\u2019t controlling of her. It is incredibly inconsiderate and selfish of you to disregard her feelings for YEARS. For what? A few likes? If the pictures are so sentimental, keep them for yourself offline.", "YTA for doing it and for the way you talk about your daughter. Calling your crying child selfish and controlling? Because you won't remove her awkward pics from social media at a time in life when image is everything. You're selfish and controlling for forcing pictures of someone online that that don't like. And your daughter of all people!!! The person you're supposed to protect more than anyone. Just wow.", "YTA how old are you? Your daughter is not being controlling, she's being a teenager. Don't post pictures of people that don't want them posted! You're the one being controlling. But seriously, you're acting like the 15 year old here bickering with another teen. \n\nI admit that it's sad that she feels this way, but you doing this certainly isn't going to help her get over her issues.

If you're not careful you're going to have a mess on your hands if you don't handle this correctly.", "YTA, she doesn\u2019t want them public, don\u2019t make them public.  It\u2019s not rocket science.

Are YOU a teenager? Assuming not then you have no idea how hard it\u2019s is for young people growing up with every move and breath blasted out to the world. It\u2019s especially difficult for girls. Do yourself a favor and look up some statistics on mental health and suicidal ideation for teenage girls and social media. Controlling? She\u2019s a kid. You\u2019re supposed to be an adult. Part of that parenting is teaching them about consent and personal autonomy. What lesson do you think she\u2019s learning when you tell her her feeling and opinions don\u2019t matter? And that she has no control over her own self image? Honestly you\u2019re being a complete and total AH right now. I\u2019m embarrassed for you.", "YTA.

Remove them! \n\nShe finds them embarrassing and wants them removed! That's her right. You didn't like that so you stormed out of the room!?! Are you a toddler?

Yes she has every right to gatekeep what pictures of her are being disseminated to the world. I have an 11 yo. I literally ask her every single time before I post photos of her if it is okay. Every. Single. Time. Sometimes she says yes, sometimes she says no. It\u2019s fine either way and honestly since she hit about 7-8 yo the amount of photos I post has decreased dramatically in general because \u201cI\u201d am concerned about putting too many things out there about her.

You are correct that you don\u2019t have to take down the photos but don\u2019t be surprised in a few years when your daughter moves out and cuts off contact with you.  The fact that you stormed out of the room shows contempt for your daughter and a lack of maturity on your part.  It sounds like social media is a bit unhealthy for you.  This is an opportunity for you to take your daughter into consideration and grow your relationship by respecting her wishes.. or not.", "YTA.  Who's the parent here?", "YTA. It's difficult enough being a teen girl and you're making it tougher. Why? What kind of clout are you chasing?

Maybe take this as an opportunity to foster some self love and confidence in your daughter. Being a teen is hard and it\u2019s difficult to look forward long term. When that teen insecurity wears off she will likely realize it was never a big deal. My mom always thought I was beautiful and just wanted some pictures. However, it\u2019s taken me like 6 years to understand that and be secure enough in myself to finally feel bad for taking that away from her lol.

I uploaded some of those photos to my instagram because I liked them. Some of her classmates follow me on there. When she found out, she asked me to either remove them as followers or to take those photos down because they were embarrassing and she didn't want her classmates to see them. I stormed out of the room because it's my social media account and I don't tell her what she can and cannot post on her account, so why should she be able to dictate what or who I have on there?
