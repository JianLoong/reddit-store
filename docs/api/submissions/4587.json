My kids, Joshua, 15m and Dakota18f, live with me. His son Kyle, 18M lives with him and his oldest son, Ronnie, 22M, has his own apartment in the city. Our kids get along well, especially Josh and Kyle. Ronnie and Dakota work full time, but when they interact it's always amiable. \n\nRecently we were at my house talking about Christmas and he mentioned that he's already ordered gifts for his boys, and wanted to know what he should get for Dakota and Josh. We talked about a handful of things that I think they'd love to have, then he mentioned that he usually labels half the gifts from Santa. I was a little taken aback and asked if he was serious. He said of course he was, and that Christmas is a magical morning in their house. \n\nHere's where I might be the asshole. I told him his kids were way too old for that, and mine certainly were. He explained that they obviously don't believe in Santa Claus, but it's just something special he and his ex wife do with the kids. I asked if he was planning to hide presents and put them under the tree on Christmas Eve night, and he responded with, \u201cWhen else would I do it?\u201d \n\nI then told him he was wasting his time and energy pretending that some mythological saint was flying around, delivering gifts for kids. He gave me a long, disappointed look and said, \u201cI'm sorry you feel that way. I was planning to wrap some of Dakota and Josh's gifts and label them from Santa, too.\u201d \n\nI told him they wouldn't appreciate that, and neither would I. He got quiet after that and left. \n\nLater he sent me a text saying his feelings were hurt by my dismissive tone, and I responded that I was just being honest. He replied that we should do Christmas morning at our own respective houses, and he'll have Josh and Dakota's gifts shipped to my house. I think he way overreacted but when I mentioned what happened to my daughter, she shook her head and said I was being a massive jerk. \n\nAITA for my reaction to him wanting to put \u201cSanta\u201d as the gift giver instead of himself?\n\n**Edit:** Well it's pretty much unanimous - I screwed up and I'm the asshole. I'm going to call him right now and grovel. \n\nThanks for the wakeup call everyone.", "created_utc": 1670882281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkcx4h/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_our_kids_are_too/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would cost you nothing to join him in being that festive, or to at least standby and support him doing it. I personally think his tradition is really sweet. My dad stopped labeling \u201cfrom Santa\u201d when I was about 13. It was a bummer, even though I rationally knew he\u2019d bought the gifts. The world is a tough place.

My kids, Joshua, 15m and Dakota18f, live with me. His son Kyle, 18M lives with him and his oldest son, Ronnie, 22M, has his own apartment in the city. Our kids get along well, especially Josh and Kyle. Ronnie and Dakota work full time, but when they interact it's always amiable. \n\nRecently we were at my house talking about Christmas and he mentioned that he's already ordered gifts for his boys, and wanted to know what he should get for Dakota and Josh. We talked about a handful of things that I think they'd love to have, then he mentioned that he usually labels half the gifts from Santa. I was a little taken aback and asked if he was serious. He said of course he was, and that Christmas is a magical morning in their house. \n\nHere's where I might be the asshole. I told him his kids were way too old for that, and mine certainly were. He explained that they obviously don't believe in Santa Claus, but it's just something special he and his ex wife do with the kids. I asked if he was planning to hide presents and put them under the tree on Christmas Eve night, and he responded with, \u201cWhen else would I do it?\u201d \n\nI then told him he was wasting his time and energy pretending that some mythological saint was flying around, delivering gifts for kids. He gave me a long, disappointed look and said, \u201cI'm sorry you feel that way. I was planning to wrap some of Dakota and Josh's gifts and label them from Santa, too.\u201d \n\nI told him they wouldn't appreciate that, and neither would I. He got quiet after that and left. \n\nLater he sent me a text saying his feelings were hurt by my dismissive tone, and I responded that I was just being honest. He replied that we should do Christmas morning at our own respective houses, and he'll have Josh and Dakota's gifts shipped to my house. I think he way overreacted but when I mentioned what happened to my daughter, she shook her head and said I was being a massive jerk. \n\nAITA for my reaction to him wanting to put \u201cSanta\u201d as the gift giver instead of himself?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s not about pretending Santa is real, it\u2019s about capturing that \u2018magical\u2019 feel of wonder, excitement and surprise. I\u2019m 36 years old and my mother still to this day will fill my stocking overnight and sneak an extra present under the tree. Nowadays, I sneak in after her and fill her stocking as well. She enjoys the memories it brings both of us.", "YTA\n\nHe obviously enjoys the custom - you can't suspend disbelief for 5 minutes to do a fun thing that is nice for your children? It's not like he's asking you to convert to another religion or something. Lighten up.", "I mean, I personally agree with you, HOWEVER, you didn\u2019t have to say it like that. It\u2019s a sweet gesture from him, and if it\u2019s what they like, it\u2019s what they like\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f YTA", "YTA. Jesus. I\u2019m 43 and still give and receive gifts from \u201cSanta.\u201d", "YTA - My grandma would label all the gifts from Santa. She loved Christmas and loved the magical time of year. We as her grandchildren loved it also. It brought her a wonderful sense of giving and got to see her smile as we all laughed and giggled like little kids mind you, she still did this with her kids and they are all well in there 50s plus. \n\nDefinitely a Grinch & MASSIVE AH", "YTA my girls are married and I still do this. It is just fun and part of the magic of the holidays. I cannot believe you were so dismissive of his tradition with his kids.", "YTA. He wanted to include you in his tradition so you and your kids would feel included and you not only turned him down but mocked him.\n\nYou understand this wasn\u2019t just about Christmas but about him wanting to start blending your families, don\u2019t you?", "Santa is the spirit of Christmas. The magic is in the selfless giving and expecting nothing in return.", "Yta. I'm in my 30s and when I visit my parents for Christmas, regardless of which actual day, they put the presents out at night. And a bunch are labeled with our favorite jokes - sandy paws, Santa claws, sanity clause, etc. It's harmless and fun, why not join the tradition? Or at least leave them be?", "Dude, the kids know it's not from santa. But it's to spread some holiday cheer, you needless grinch... who is it hurting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "YTG (grinch). I\u2019m 34 and my mom still labels presents from Santa. I don\u2019t really care either way but she likes it so what\u2019s the problem.", "YTA. \n\nI'm 34 and my bf is 40 and we do the whole \"from Santa\" thing on our gifts. Obviously we know Santa isn't real but it's fun and festive. It's Christmas. I'm sorry you feel the need to suck the joy out of it.", "YTA - its sad that your daughter understands how much of a jerk you're being and you're 100% blind to see it. Let the man and the kids have some innocent fun. Like WTF is wrong with you that you'd shit all over such a perfectly innocent and charming tradition?", "YTA . Also, speaking for your kids? Did you ask them if they wouldn't \"appreciate\" Santa gifts? It sounds fun and cute but you are acting like it's disturbing and wrong. Maybe your kids could just go to your boyfriend's house so they can experience a fun Christmas for once in who knows how long.", "YTA. I'm in my mid-40s and have no kids, but I put my husband's gifts under the tree before I go to bed Xmas Eve and he puts mine out when he wakes up (before me) on Xmas morning. We know it's not actually from Santa, but I love the magic of waking up to \"Santa\" and he does it for me because it makes me happy and he's not a Scrooge. He doesn't even really love the holidays, but he does it because it means the world for me. If he shamed me about it, we wouldn't have stayed together.", "Bah Humbug Mrs Scrooge! Are there any other ways you plan on sucking the fun and magic out of the holiday? YTA\n\nAnd as far as I'm concerned, Santa is real you grinch. Santa can just represent the feeling of happiness and joy people are supposed to experience around the holidays.  No one is ever too old for some fun and a little make believe.", "I\u2019m 50 and I still get presents labeled from Santa. YTA. Lighten up Francis.", "YTA and a grinch.", "YTA. I'm filling a stocking for a 14 year old this year....and a 42 year old and a 65 year old and a 75 year old and two labradoodles. Because Christmas", "I see where this is going. He's tons of fun while you're no fun at all. You complete each other. Geeze lady who pissed in your cornflakes during the holiday season.", "Yeah, YTA. It\u2019s harmless fun and anyone with the slightest bit of humor would appreciate it. We intersperse gifts from Santa here and there among the items under the tree and everyone knows who the gift is from, based on handwriting,, wrapping paper, or simply because the giver hands over the gift themselves. Don\u2019t be a killjoy!  \n\nAlso: \u201cjust being honest\u201d is just about the most useless retort (especially in response to someone saying you hurt their feelings). It\u2019s the go-to excuse that assholes use to justify airing their rude and shitty opinions.", "Oh good god. The teenagers don\u2019t actually think Santa exists. My parents labeled gifts from Santa long after we stopped believing. Lighten up and have a little fun. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nMy parents kept Santa gifts going until we were all well into our twenties and we started not all coming home for Christmas. Of course we had all stopped believing years before but it was just a bit of Christmas magic. If you don\u2019t want your kids doing it, that\u2019s fine but he\u2019s totally fine to do with his.", "YTA \nI\u2019m 32 and married.  My mum still does a stocking from Santa for my brother, my husband and me.", "YTA\n\nNo one in his family believes in Santa. But FFS it\u2019s a family tradition. \n\nMy spouse is near 50 and his parents still send gifts across country \u201cfrom Santa\u201d.", "OP, YTA.   \n\n\nPlease take the hint from all of the Grinch references here. Let your heart grow three sizes TODAY. Drive over there and drop off an apology note and a gift from Santa. A sign that says \u201cI believe in Santa\u201d would be appropriate.", "YTA personally I don\u2019t do it but where is the harm? It is an innocent and sweet thing to do so get over yourself and have a word with yourself whilst you\u2019re at it.", "Okay I\u2019m 23 and sometimes my grandma will put \u201cfrom Santa\u201d even though I know full well it\u2019s from her . Stop being a grinch .", "Yes YTA, look it would be one thing if his kids still thought Santa was real. However, this was just something fun and cute he likes to do. \n\nMy mom labeled half the gifts from santa till I was almost 30 . \n\nYou basically told him something he enjoys and is harmless is stupid and annoying. You sucked the joy out of his heart and stomped on it, why? Just cause it's a bit silly?", "YTA.", "YTA When my sister and I were young, we labelled our gifts for our parents as from Santa. I\u2019m case it wasn\u2019t obvious, we didn\u2019t think our parents believed Santa was real, it was just nice.", "I worked my butt off to keep my son believing in the Jolly guy until he was almost 14. He asked me about 2 years before if Santa was real. I told him when he was ready for a true answer. He waited 2 years and then I told him the Secret of Santa. So now he is the keeper of Santa and gets to share the joy of this mythological person with his niece and nephew. \nYTA for trying to ruin this man\u2019s joy at Christmas! We should all learn from him.", "YTA, that man is a treasure and should be protected as such.", "YTA. Santa is the spirit of love. What possible harm could BF\u2019s style have caused?", "I'm Jewish, in my 30s, haven't lived at home for 15 years and haven't believed in Santa since I was 5, and I still get a stocking \"from Santa\" every year \ud83d\ude05 \n\nI'm glad you can see YTA, OP. I hope your boyfriend and his family bring a bit of fun and magic to your holidays.", "Whoa\u2026..I hope I never lose my Christmas spirit. \n\n\nBah humbug!", "You need to read John Gottman. Your partner made a bid of affection--being vulnerable about his joy around Christmas traditions, you not only didn't \"turn towards\" the bid, you didn't \"turn away\" (eh, not really our thing but you do you), but you \"turned AGAINST\".....and that's a shit way to treat your partner. I know you've already heard it's shit a few hundred times, so I'm just here to share a framework/term for what happened and a resource for saving your relationships.", "Dont be such a grinch", "YTA !!enough said.", "YTA. I am 23 and my dad still does this and I love it.", "YTA\n\nI'm one of the most Grinch-y people you'll meet and I think that's incredibly sweet that he still tries to capture that magic with his kids. I hope you can smooth things over and have a merry Christmas. Hopefully Santa won't bring you coal!", "YTA, lots of people still use Santa, its not at all detrimental and your reaction was, frankly pretty ridiculous and cruel. Get off your freaking high horse and try to treat your husband with a tiny bit of kindness about this truly harmless tradition.", "YTA - I give 'Santa' presents to my parents and they're in their sixties. Lighten up.", "Yeah... I'm almost your age and my mom still gets me presents \"from Santa\"... I started giving her some \"from Santa\" too a while back. It's just a bit of fun. I hope you can actually embrace it and have a little joy out of it.", "YTA.

Miserable attitude.", "He wants you to participate in a tradition that him and his ex wife had? He should go continue that tradition with his ex wife then.", "NTA. If there were small children, I get playing along with the idea of Santa. Maybe if HE were the parent of the 15 years old and needing to hold on to their childhood, you could have bit your tongue. But HE wants to infantalize YOUR children. And that would probably be awkward and insulting to them. As the mother, you did the right thing by your kids.", "I'm 47, and my brother is 45, neither of us believes in Santa, and our mother knows this, but she still writes \"from Santa\" on some of our Xmas gifts.

We used to find them in a snowman decoration but he got too old & we switched to a decorated box, with a stuffed Santa on, & we continued the tradition by adding my niblings too, as they appeared over time.
