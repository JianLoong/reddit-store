But, I'd bet your sister would love it if you showed up to a game. Like 1 a year would probably be enough. But even if you don't, nta. I try and support my brother when I can, but I get busy, and sometimes there are not enough hours in the day... My goal is always go to some of the things once and a while.", "Info: How is your relationship with your younger sister? Does she want you at these events? If your younger sister wants you to support her, then you should go! But of not then go about your own business.", "Info: Did you participate in any sports or other activities that your sister attended?", "NTA. This sounds like a blur of intertwined facts and feelings. Also, depression really can warp a person's perspective (you have my upmost sympathies).\n\nI attended a concert and show my little sister was in. Both times, she gave me a hug and thanked me. Depression was much less that day. :)", "NTA. My brother never came to any of my games, heck most of the time no one from my family came to my games.", "NTA\u2026 if your mother calls you names when you don\u2019t do what she wants and she\u2019s constantly judging you, that\u2019s abuse. That may not be what you think but you\u2019ve admitted here that she calls you a selfish asshole\u2026 that isn\u2019t normal. Verbal abuse can be extremely harmful even though blows are never struck so it is perfectly acceptable to not want to deal with your mother.\n\nAs fas your question about you and your sister, you should go to one or two games to support your sister if that\u2019s what she would like. Ask her. You don\u2019t have to sit near your parents or anything but if she wants you to go just give her a general idea of where you think you\u2019ll sit so she knows where to look for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
