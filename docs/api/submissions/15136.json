{"id": 15136, "submission_id": "12r9lb8", "title": "AITA for telling my wife we can no longer afford to give our dog an allowance?", "selftext": "We got a dog a few years ago and training him was rough. He was already a full grown dog and had never lived inside.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019d give him treats and encouragement and eventually he stopped being so wild inside and chewing things up and he now uses the bathroom outside etc.\n\nLike I said, we already give him treats for doing good things or listening to commands etc.\n\nBut in the midst of the initial training, my wife came up with the idea that we should give him a weekly \u201callowance\u201d for being good and not having accidents, etc.\n\nThis was set at $25 a week. Obviously we didn\u2019t give him the cash lol. Instead she\u2019d take him to PetSmart and whatever he started sniffing or seemed to like she\u2019d buy, or she\u2019ll get him special treats beyond what we already have at home.\n\nI thought it was silly then, but whatever, I was just happy when we\u2019d go a week without piss on the carpet or a chewed up pillow. So I agreed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been this way for years. But now money is tight. We can\u2019t really afford to $100 a month extra. Not only that but that money takes priority over our own \u201callowances\u201d\n\nFor instance, I wanted to go out to eat last week, but because I have to set aside $50 every pay check, my wife said we couldn\u2019t go otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be able to essentially pay our dog.\n\nNot to mention going outside to potty or not chewing things up is second nature for him now. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to buy him stuff, but we are barely making ends meet at the moment. $50 a check is a big expense.\n\nI brought this up with her last night and she got very upset that I would even suggest not rewarding him. That I was being selfish for wanting to spend the money on myself.\n\nI told her we already buy him food, and treats, and he already has 30+ chew toys, and that he doesn\u2019t need a bigger bone every week, he doesn\u2019t need gourmet food all the time. None of this is even including relatively frequent dog spa visits.\n\nShe told me I shouldn\u2019t have let her get the dog if I \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take care of him\u201d\n\nBut I do take care of him. We go on walks, play in the back yard, he has a whole room in our house with chew toys and a big bed. \n\nI think it is unfair to say I\u2019m not taking care of him because I can\u2019t afford to give him a luxurious lifestyle anymore, or that I\u2019d like to go out to eat and have a little luxury myself every once in a while.\n\nBut maybe I am wrong? \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: Additional info I meant to mention.\n\nMy wife cannot have kids due to a medical issue that would put her at high risk and was devastated when she found out, as was I. But we also cannot afford to adopt or even have that desire right now to be honest. Our dog I think was her way of coping with this and being a mother in some sense. So he is like her child. I love him too but she is attached to him in a way that is much deeper than what I would say is typical.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nShe does not believe the *allowance* is teaching him anything. It is just her way of doting on him. She knows that he is not associating it with good behavior. So it is not an attempt at teaching him anything. More of \u201che\u2019s been good so we should do something good for him\u201d\n\nEdit 3:\n\nJust going to answer a few more questions by copying my responses.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she get a job?\n\nCertainly something we could look into, and not something she has said she is opposed to at all. We were completely fine before all of this inflation. But everything going up by a little to a lot has really strained us. It took quite a bit of time to even realize it was happening really because we\u2019d had a little bit of a cushion and when you are slowly breaking even or dipping in $10-20 a check I just didn\u2019t realize how little wiggle room we actually had. Now I\u2019m just looking at what expenses are the most frivolous and what I can cut out. So really it\u2019s been the last couple of weeks to a month that I\u2019ve begun stressing about it.\n\nDog allowance?\n\nI do think a lot of people in here are unfairly criticizing her because of the phrasing of \u201cdog\u2019s allowance\u201d this is really her allowance to spend on our dog. I think maybe I\u2019ve done a poor job communicating the finer details which wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she get out more or make friends?\n\nShe does take him to the park and on walks.\n\nBut also, she is very introverted, I have tried suggesting she hang out with her friends more but she rarely ever does. Plus most of her friends have kids now, and she doesn\u2019t admit it but I know it hurts her. A couple of them didn\u2019t even want kids and I think she just feels jealous or like it\u2019s unfair. Not that they have kids but that she can\u2019t.\n\nShe was essentially forced to have an abortion because of a medical issue she didn\u2019t even know she had. I don\u2019t want to go much into it, but it really messed with her. The two most impactful memories I have is the light and joy in her eyes when she found out she was pregnant, and all that joy and light being sucked out when she realized she couldn\u2019t keep it.", "created_utc": 1681862536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r9lb8/aita_for_telling_my_wife_we_can_no_longer_afford/", "score": 2283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dog will get old and die. everything you write sounds like she's lost touch with the world and invested everything in the dog. it's not normal for a dog to need their own room, that should be a room for craft or home gym or home library or something that she can actually engage with the world and herself. it's not good that its good for you to have her available when you have time off. she has no investment in anything.. she has no stakes in anything except a dog..  she needs to find her way back to the world... education, community, career. its nothing to do with being an introvert, she's simply not engaged, she's cut herself off and lost perspective on the world around.", "Definitely needs therapy.

It\u2019s not been fully studied but basically the hypothesis is that a dog knows that when your scent in the house has decreased to a certain level that means you\u2019ll be home soon (and refresh the house with your scent) Kind of like an hourglass but instead of sand falling it\u2019s your unique smell fading.", "The thing is, they're dogs! They don't know how much the toys cost! They don't know how money works! \n\nMy dog gets a new toy every time I take her to the groomer (which she hates), so every 6-8 weeks. I rarely spend more than $5 on that toy. Her favorite toys are always the cheap ones. All she cares about is whether it crinkles. \n\nNTA, OP. I can't even begin to imagine what my dog would do with $100 a month unless we put it toward her Hill's Science Diet kibble.", "It can also be done by having a toy box with a lid. When the dog gets bored with a toy, put it in the bottom of the box and bring out a \"new\" toy that he's had time to forget about.

It implies a sense of routine. They are very different. It\u2019s more like a mouse realizing that every time you ring a bell, you get cheese. It\u2019s more cause and effect. Your dog is remembering your cues. Your dog realizes that it\u2019s Sunday bc of the routine you follow. Your routine on a Sunday is different than a Tuesday. If dogs do have a sense of time, then it\u2019s very short term, not like a person\u2019s. \n\nETA: I\u2019m going to stop answering after this, because arguing about a dog\u2019s sense of time on a post about giving a dog an allowance is a new level of absurdity for me.", "This.

Not so much.", "Dogs definitely have a sense of time", " I love dogs and cats. I understand they are family members as well. But, after working for.my money there is no way in hell I would deny myself a night out in order to treat a dog to a bunch of garbage toys from the pet store. Your wife sounds lonely and as you implied the dog is her child since she doesn't have any. I would talk to her. Explain from your perspective and tell her she can have $25 a month but if you need that money you will take it. Humans working and paying the bills have to be top priority. She will need to replace that activity with something else since they have a routine. Help her find something else to do that is free.\nI forgot to add NTA", "NTA- can I suggest a solution, instead of treating the dog to toys, chews, etcetera once a week your wife can bake an extra special set of dog cookies for him and then on a Saturday or Sunday you take him for a really special walk. Plan a special couple of hours playing a game he loves. To be honest, all the buying treats and toys isn't making your dog happy. It's making your wife happy, from a dog welfare point of view tell her it's time the dog got to do happy dog things such as scent games, a wide variety of walks,playing hide and seek. \n\nBuy your dog the book 101 dog tricks and a clicker, dog will be much happier for the learning and interaction. Time your surrogate child went to school.\n\nTell your wife that your dog is part of the family. He needs to be treated as part of the family. By not cutting down on the expensive allowance he receives gog is being treated as a privileged guest. A family member who is valued joins in with cost cutting when the family is budgeting. \n\nFinally, set up a small savings account called Dogs Holiday or something like this. Put in a small amount of cash when you can afford it. Perhaps 20 a month. Then, when times are better, the dog gets a big treat and goes away on a nice trip with you. Alternatively, dogs' savings can be for when he is older and will need expensive vet treatment. \n\nFinally, get your wife some counselling because the surrogate child thing with your dog is edging in to dangerous territory. When dog finally dies, she will never cope.", "Nah, my sister loves that shit and we're black\n\nShe just loves animals.", "I don't even think that's budget though, that's just a normal amount of spending on a dog. OP's wife is way in the excess.", "OP, your wife is transferring her maternal feelings and emotions to a dog. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I LOVE dogs and I believe they\u2019re our best friends, but even I know that they\u2019re dogs - they may be happy to see us and sense our emotions, but your dog isn\u2019t a child and he does not react to things like a child would. Ergo: he isn\u2019t going to be missing out if he doesn\u2019t get 25 dollars worth of new toys every week. Heck, you can get soft plushies from the likes of Goodwill or second-hand thrift stores for far far less. \n\nBut I get it, your wife can\u2019t have kids so she is treating your dog as if it\u2019s your kid. Lots of people do that, it\u2019s not inherently wrong. But your dog, as bad as it sounds, has only a relatively short life span compared to your own. Even at best, the dog is very unlikely to live past 20 years, with many dogs unfortunately passing away 10-15 year marks depending in their size and breed. I was devastated when I lost my pooch and he was never a \u201cchild\u201d to me. If your wife considers your dog as her child, she\u2019s going to be inconsolable if and when it passes away. She needs therapy ASAP. There are healthy ways to cope with the loss of parenthood and having a pet is one of them, but her way seems very unhealthy - it\u2019s not even about the money (god knows many people spend money on clothes and strollers for their pets), it\u2019s about the emotional attachment level which can severely affect her mental health should the dog ever fall ill or die. Frankly speaking, she needs therapy because this will not go over on its own, it will get worse. The fact that she already behaves like the dog is going to be \u201cmissing out\u201d because you won\u2019t spend 100 dollars a month on it (on top of their regular food and grooming and everything else that comes with pets) is alarming. Accommodating her won\u2019t make this issue go away - she needs to deal with the trauma that has come from the loss of parenthood and clearly needs professional help to do so.", "As other people are saying here, your dog is not going to last more than 10-12 years, specially since you already got him as an adult. Are you and your wife ready to deal with it when he passes away? She needs to understand she's doing all of this for HERSELF, not because she wants the dog to be happy - I'm pretty sure he couldn't care less if he didn't get any new toys for the rest of his life.

Yea, the dog doesn't literally know it's Sunday and that Sunday is dog park day, but they pretty clearly have a concept of the fact that they go to the park every so often", "I don't know where you live but I'm in the US and my Teddy gets a Barkbox once a month. $25 a month. That's better than $100. They design the toys and treats in the box to the size of your dog. And every month there is a different theme. Like in February it was Valentines day themed toys. It's really cute. Every month Teddy gets 2 bags of treats, one bag of chew sticks and 2 new toys. And he knows what that box is when it comes in the mail. He gets so excited I think he may wag his little tail straight off his little backside.", "Hahaha yo! I don't have any awards, take a random emoji \ud83d\udc1b(it's a caterpillar)", "Lmao my dog is like a kid when it comes to shopping bags. We hide a new toy in one of the bags and let him find it, and swear he jumps for joy when he finds it. However he gets super butthurt every time we go and don't get him something. And he's the same with the love. He has a toy box full of old toys, he pops the squeekers in 30 minutes or less every time we get one, and 90% of toys with stuffing will be dead by morning, with shrapnel everywhere. He's got maybe 5-6 that he still plays with regularly, but i can't throw any of them out. He knows! I swear he does! I've tried in the past and it results in him searching the house for a couple days, then when he can't find it he mopes for a couple and won't give me kisses. So I'm stuck with a box of ratty ass toys he won't really touch but god forbid i throw them out. Yeah, he's spoiled lol. And he owns me.", "Dog \u201cmoms\u201d are so fucking weird.", "Dogs do have a very vague concept of time in some ways, but it's absolutely nowhere even remotely near the level that we experience time.

I chose between a $30 plushie and a $3 plushie for my dog and got the $3 one. She loved it, but it still doesn't hold a candle to her two favourites - the elephant Humphrey and Raccoon. I sincerely doubt the $30 one would have held her interest either. The elephant is an old plushie from my childhood, now disgusting and partly chewed up. The raccoon is one of those long flat squeaky toys (skinnees?) that's perfect for tug of war and throwing around.\n\nMy dog still gets everything she needs and more, but she really doesn't need new toys every week. She has plenty of toys! It would be much more beneficial to save $100/month for unexpected vet costs, they tend to come up. For my dog's birthday we went on a forest walk and played her favourite game. Not too different from a regular day, but she loved it.", "People can definitely take pet ownership to the extreme, however, there's nothing wrong with giving a dog a good life if you have the means. Consciousness is consciousness, and if you made the decision to care for a being, it's your responsibility to make sure that being has a good life. \n\nPeople who get a dog and then stick it in a crate all day long only letting it out for a few hours each day are far weirder. I'd rather be wholesome weird than cruel weird.", "Are you assuming that or is there any reference for your claim? I'm not saying you're wrong but I wouldn't know of any reliable experimental setup to test whether dogs notice a difference in frequency of events like this. If you can't experimentally test a hypothesis like this, you'll never know how dogs experience time and routines.", "You're assuming here. Reacting to a signal like a bell or behavioral cues is very different than sensing that it's time for a specific thing of your routine. You have no idea if there are behavioral cues or not.
