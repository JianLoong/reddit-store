{"id": 15136, "submission_id": "12r9lb8", "title": "AITA for telling my wife we can no longer afford to give our dog an allowance?", "selftext": "We got a dog a few years ago and training him was rough. He was already a full grown dog and had never lived inside.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019d give him treats and encouragement and eventually he stopped being so wild inside and chewing things up and he now uses the bathroom outside etc.\n\nLike I said, we already give him treats for doing good things or listening to commands etc.\n\nBut in the midst of the initial training, my wife came up with the idea that we should give him a weekly \u201callowance\u201d for being good and not having accidents, etc.\n\nThis was set at $25 a week. Obviously we didn\u2019t give him the cash lol. Instead she\u2019d take him to PetSmart and whatever he started sniffing or seemed to like she\u2019d buy, or she\u2019ll get him special treats beyond what we already have at home.\n\nI thought it was silly then, but whatever, I was just happy when we\u2019d go a week without piss on the carpet or a chewed up pillow. So I agreed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been this way for years. But now money is tight. We can\u2019t really afford to $100 a month extra. Not only that but that money takes priority over our own \u201callowances\u201d\n\nFor instance, I wanted to go out to eat last week, but because I have to set aside $50 every pay check, my wife said we couldn\u2019t go otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be able to essentially pay our dog.\n\nNot to mention going outside to potty or not chewing things up is second nature for him now. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to buy him stuff, but we are barely making ends meet at the moment. $50 a check is a big expense.\n\nI brought this up with her last night and she got very upset that I would even suggest not rewarding him. That I was being selfish for wanting to spend the money on myself.\n\nI told her we already buy him food, and treats, and he already has 30+ chew toys, and that he doesn\u2019t need a bigger bone every week, he doesn\u2019t need gourmet food all the time. None of this is even including relatively frequent dog spa visits.\n\nShe told me I shouldn\u2019t have let her get the dog if I \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take care of him\u201d\n\nBut I do take care of him. We go on walks, play in the back yard, he has a whole room in our house with chew toys and a big bed. \n\nI think it is unfair to say I\u2019m not taking care of him because I can\u2019t afford to give him a luxurious lifestyle anymore, or that I\u2019d like to go out to eat and have a little luxury myself every once in a while.\n\nBut maybe I am wrong? \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: Additional info I meant to mention.\n\nMy wife cannot have kids due to a medical issue that would put her at high risk and was devastated when she found out, as was I. But we also cannot afford to adopt or even have that desire right now to be honest. Our dog I think was her way of coping with this and being a mother in some sense. So he is like her child. I love him too but she is attached to him in a way that is much deeper than what I would say is typical.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nShe does not believe the *allowance* is teaching him anything. It is just her way of doting on him. She knows that he is not associating it with good behavior. So it is not an attempt at teaching him anything. More of \u201che\u2019s been good so we should do something good for him\u201d\n\nEdit 3:\n\nJust going to answer a few more questions by copying my responses.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she get a job?\n\nCertainly something we could look into, and not something she has said she is opposed to at all. We were completely fine before all of this inflation. But everything going up by a little to a lot has really strained us. It took quite a bit of time to even realize it was happening really because we\u2019d had a little bit of a cushion and when you are slowly breaking even or dipping in $10-20 a check I just didn\u2019t realize how little wiggle room we actually had. Now I\u2019m just looking at what expenses are the most frivolous and what I can cut out. So really it\u2019s been the last couple of weeks to a month that I\u2019ve begun stressing about it.\n\nDog allowance?\n\nI do think a lot of people in here are unfairly criticizing her because of the phrasing of \u201cdog\u2019s allowance\u201d this is really her allowance to spend on our dog. I think maybe I\u2019ve done a poor job communicating the finer details which wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she get out more or make friends?\n\nShe does take him to the park and on walks.\n\nBut also, she is very introverted, I have tried suggesting she hang out with her friends more but she rarely ever does. Plus most of her friends have kids now, and she doesn\u2019t admit it but I know it hurts her. A couple of them didn\u2019t even want kids and I think she just feels jealous or like it\u2019s unfair. Not that they have kids but that she can\u2019t.\n\nShe was essentially forced to have an abortion because of a medical issue she didn\u2019t even know she had. I don\u2019t want to go much into it, but it really messed with her. The two most impactful memories I have is the light and joy in her eyes when she found out she was pregnant, and all that joy and light being sucked out when she realized she couldn\u2019t keep it.", "created_utc": 1681862536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r9lb8/aita_for_telling_my_wife_we_can_no_longer_afford/", "score": 911, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That being said, I would not put there needs over my spouses or mine, especially if there is a financial bind. She needs to go see a therapist and work through this issue. It is SO damn hard being a childless woman in a marriage when all your friends are in the throes of having and raising kids. She also needs another outlet, volunteer or a job, something because she's dwelling on it. Even if she says she's not she is.", "She is complaining about a \u201cdog allowance\u201d that is mostly to make her feel better about herself. If they stopped doing this the dog wouldn\u2019t even notice so this is really for her. Tell her to get a job if she so badly needs this expense to feel better about herself. This just screams entitlement. I actually was on the same boat, stay at home wife with no kids but started working again because of inflation and also because we spoil our dog rotten. I get a rush taking my dog to petsmart for toys and trust me if I stopped tmw this little guy wouldn\u2019t notice and would be content chewing a dirty ole sock. Ma\u2019am get a job to support petsmart habit. This isn\u2019t about the dog.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. In the most non-judgmental way possible, I think that money might be better utilized in paying for some therapy for your wife. \n\nIt\u2019s great that she has found comfort in her relationship with your dog, but she seems to be clearly struggling. Infertility issues are incredibly rough for anybody and it sounds like she isn\u2019t forming relationships with friends, doesn\u2019t work, etc. It sounds like a really rough and isolating place to be in. \n\nHope you guys are able to work through some of these tough emotions and find new healthy patterns to help move forward. Life sucks sometimes.", "Before I got to the edit I was wandering if she had trouble conceiving. It's obvious she's still traumatized and channeling it into the dog (in a positive way at least).\n\nThink about that - it's still cheaper than therapy. I think it's a good idea she gets a job. She would be active, meet people, have missions. Also you would be able to afford therapy for her to find out who she is beyond a wife and a dog lover.", "NTA I have pets that I centre my whole life around because I think that\u2019s how it should be when you take ownership of something so vulnerable. But $100 a month on frivolities when ends aren\u2019t meeting is ridiculous. From a practical point of view for something that may help your wife-dozens on dozens of toys are going to be useless if a vet bill comes up you can\u2019t afford\n\nWith the amount of toys he has I\u2019d take several away now and rotate different ones in and and out-then they\u2019re like new to the pup, he\u2019s still getting treats but it\u2019s not annihilating \n\nBest of luck to you all", "NTA. I doubt the dog would even notice not getting another chew toy for a little while.\n\nYour edits made me teary-eyed. I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nIt sounds like your rescue dog won the pet-lottery. It also sounds like the two of you would make fantastic parents. Once you have grieved the loss of your unborn child and the loss of having the traditional family, I hope you consider adoption or surrogacy. All the best!", "Yes, OP\u2019s wife is equating money spent with love - hopefully she\u2019s not also measuring OPs love with how much he spends on her\u2026", "Cardboard boxes, my old tshirts and some assorted toys. Guess which ones she prefers? \ud83d\ude04", "Reminds me of a tweet I once saw that went, \"Have you ever been like 'WTF white people' even when you are a white people?\"\n\nYes, I am a white people, but this is too white even for me.", "I\u2019m have a rescue pit mix and she\u2019s the goodest girl. By the time I met my significant other, I had her for 4 years and while we\u2019re all slightly obsessed with her little donkeyhorse ways, my boyfriend is on another level. He got her her own Christmas stocking & fills it to the brim, and constantly gets her toys, clothes and treats \u2014 he bought her a gold plated chain for Christmas. \n\nSo much comes for her, she thinks every package we get delivered is for her and must go through a thorough sniffspection before it gets put away.  \n\nHe is white, I am not. As is to say, can confirm.", "That's racist bro", "This is so wrong to say. I have again lost faith  in the Reddit Community because of this. \ud83d\ude1fSigh.", "I died laughing \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udc80", "NTA and strong agree.\n\nAlso, she needs to re-enter the workforce immediately.", "A frozen kong filled with peanut butter and cheese is one of my pup\u2019s greatest joys. Or a really long, slow walk where I spend an hour letting her sniff every interesting twig we pass. Dogs are sooo easy to please on a budget, and doing a \u2018family brainstorming session\u2019 of these little things that make the pup happiest will be a fun afternoon too (and will reassure the wife that OP does love and care for their dog too)", "Yep, this exactly. This is only a bandaid, the real issue has to be addressed eventually.", "I really like this idea. A special bonding activity that is more focused on time together, rather than purchasing things.", "Or dog walking!", "Dude, if you don't live in a castle or on a working farm, it should take her no more then couple hours a week to do chores for household of two. \n\nIt is not about the dog allowances. \nYou need pay more attention to her. Something is going on. Hopefully just old fashion affair, and not a depression or another serious mental health issue.", "Is your dog actually a horse?", "I'm feeling like a neglectful dog mum now :(", "They\u2019re struggling financially according to OP", "So the highlight of her week is to buy toy for a dog?  She needs a hobby. Or better, a work. \n\nJust because you want a hot dinner each evening, you limited her life to a weekly trip to PetSmart.\nThere is no way she is really happy. No one would be.", "My cat prefers the random boxes we get from online orders and the paper grocery bags. He didn't even like the bags I bought for him that where laced with catnip. He all so loves the random moth on the ceiling.", "Sure most dogs don\u2019t need a whole bedroom full of chew toys. But if the dog is anything like mine\u2026he is the most toy-oriented dog i\u2019ve had or even known. He gets sooooooo excited with a new toy. \n\nBut after a week or so toys lose their luster. I\u2019ve tried hiding and rotating them out occasionally but he\u2019s only really shown joy when reunited with a couple especially good toys. The vast majority of toys simply hold no interest once their novelty wears off, so a roomful might as well be none.\n\nI\u2019ve had to cut back a lot but I do feel guilty, especially because he\u2019s so jealous of his little human brother getting so much attention and new toys.\n\nI think it\u2019s good of her to want to give dog a good life. But that can also be done for less money by playing with, training, walking etc.", "You're a mom of 3, with 2 pets.", "They\u2019re pretty high in calories. I have a small dog so I avoid them for that reason. \n\nThe Wellness Puppy Bites are great and are very easily broken down into small pieces. I also like offering single-ingredient treats like beef liver bites, freeze-dried minnows and dog-safe fruits/veggies.", "I mean, the party is for the people, the cat is just an excuse", "Because there is literally 0 evidence to support it.", "Please remind her that this isn't feasible because if the dog has some random medical thing pop up, you probably will not be able to get him it because of the over spoiling and lack of funds. Animals have a hard time communicating when sick/in pain and vets are expensive especially if something isn't caught on time", "Honestly, it's irresponsible of you and your wife to spend that money and not leave enough behind for any emergency treatments the dog may need.", "I personally think it would have been less shitty of them to just own that rather than use the cat as an excuse. Especially when it involved ditching previously made plans.", "\u201cShe absolutely insists on spending an improbable amount on a pet who has no comprehension of what she\u2019s doing, and prioritises it over other expenses related to actual people\u201d is significantly more support for her not being upfront about the spending than like\u2026 87% of the imaginary bullshit people cling to on here.", "They both need to sit down and look at their expenses, and have a discussion about where you can cut back. Maybe if it's the difference between keeping streaming services and the dogs allowance she might see it's a choice that needs to be made, or that she could cut back, not stop spending altogether."]}
