{"id": 15136, "submission_id": "12r9lb8", "title": "AITA for telling my wife we can no longer afford to give our dog an allowance?", "selftext": "We got a dog a few years ago and training him was rough. He was already a full grown dog and had never lived inside.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019d give him treats and encouragement and eventually he stopped being so wild inside and chewing things up and he now uses the bathroom outside etc.\n\nLike I said, we already give him treats for doing good things or listening to commands etc.\n\nBut in the midst of the initial training, my wife came up with the idea that we should give him a weekly \u201callowance\u201d for being good and not having accidents, etc.\n\nThis was set at $25 a week. Obviously we didn\u2019t give him the cash lol. Instead she\u2019d take him to PetSmart and whatever he started sniffing or seemed to like she\u2019d buy, or she\u2019ll get him special treats beyond what we already have at home.\n\nI thought it was silly then, but whatever, I was just happy when we\u2019d go a week without piss on the carpet or a chewed up pillow. So I agreed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been this way for years. But now money is tight. We can\u2019t really afford to $100 a month extra. Not only that but that money takes priority over our own \u201callowances\u201d\n\nFor instance, I wanted to go out to eat last week, but because I have to set aside $50 every pay check, my wife said we couldn\u2019t go otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be able to essentially pay our dog.\n\nNot to mention going outside to potty or not chewing things up is second nature for him now. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to buy him stuff, but we are barely making ends meet at the moment. $50 a check is a big expense.\n\nI brought this up with her last night and she got very upset that I would even suggest not rewarding him. That I was being selfish for wanting to spend the money on myself.\n\nI told her we already buy him food, and treats, and he already has 30+ chew toys, and that he doesn\u2019t need a bigger bone every week, he doesn\u2019t need gourmet food all the time. None of this is even including relatively frequent dog spa visits.\n\nShe told me I shouldn\u2019t have let her get the dog if I \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take care of him\u201d\n\nBut I do take care of him. We go on walks, play in the back yard, he has a whole room in our house with chew toys and a big bed. \n\nI think it is unfair to say I\u2019m not taking care of him because I can\u2019t afford to give him a luxurious lifestyle anymore, or that I\u2019d like to go out to eat and have a little luxury myself every once in a while.\n\nBut maybe I am wrong? \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: Additional info I meant to mention.\n\nMy wife cannot have kids due to a medical issue that would put her at high risk and was devastated when she found out, as was I. But we also cannot afford to adopt or even have that desire right now to be honest. Our dog I think was her way of coping with this and being a mother in some sense. So he is like her child. I love him too but she is attached to him in a way that is much deeper than what I would say is typical.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nShe does not believe the *allowance* is teaching him anything. It is just her way of doting on him. She knows that he is not associating it with good behavior. So it is not an attempt at teaching him anything. More of \u201che\u2019s been good so we should do something good for him\u201d", "created_utc": 1681862536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r9lb8/aita_for_telling_my_wife_we_can_no_longer_afford/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is also just trying to maintain a ritual that's been a regular part of her and your dog's life for so long.  And the dog just wants to be a good boy and validated via his 'allowance'.
