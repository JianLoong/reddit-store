{"id": 15136, "submission_id": "12r9lb8", "title": "AITA for telling my wife we can no longer afford to give our dog an allowance?", "selftext": "We got a dog a few years ago and training him was rough. He was already a full grown dog and had never lived inside.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019d give him treats and encouragement and eventually he stopped being so wild inside and chewing things up and he now uses the bathroom outside etc.\n\nLike I said, we already give him treats for doing good things or listening to commands etc.\n\nBut in the midst of the initial training, my wife came up with the idea that we should give him a weekly \u201callowance\u201d for being good and not having accidents, etc.\n\nThis was set at $25 a week. Obviously we didn\u2019t give him the cash lol. Instead she\u2019d take him to PetSmart and whatever he started sniffing or seemed to like she\u2019d buy, or she\u2019ll get him special treats beyond what we already have at home.\n\nI thought it was silly then, but whatever, I was just happy when we\u2019d go a week without piss on the carpet or a chewed up pillow. So I agreed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been this way for years. But now money is tight. We can\u2019t really afford to $100 a month extra. Not only that but that money takes priority over our own \u201callowances\u201d\n\nFor instance, I wanted to go out to eat last week, but because I have to set aside $50 every pay check, my wife said we couldn\u2019t go otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be able to essentially pay our dog.\n\nNot to mention going outside to potty or not chewing things up is second nature for him now. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to buy him stuff, but we are barely making ends meet at the moment. $50 a check is a big expense.\n\nI brought this up with her last night and she got very upset that I would even suggest not rewarding him. That I was being selfish for wanting to spend the money on myself.\n\nI told her we already buy him food, and treats, and he already has 30+ chew toys, and that he doesn\u2019t need a bigger bone every week, he doesn\u2019t need gourmet food all the time. None of this is even including relatively frequent dog spa visits.\n\nShe told me I shouldn\u2019t have let her get the dog if I \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take care of him\u201d\n\nBut I do take care of him. We go on walks, play in the back yard, he has a whole room in our house with chew toys and a big bed. \n\nI think it is unfair to say I\u2019m not taking care of him because I can\u2019t afford to give him a luxurious lifestyle anymore, or that I\u2019d like to go out to eat and have a little luxury myself every once in a while.\n\nBut maybe I am wrong? \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: Additional info I meant to mention.\n\nMy wife cannot have kids due to a medical issue that would put her at high risk and was devastated when she found out, as was I. But we also cannot afford to adopt or even have that desire right now to be honest. Our dog I think was her way of coping with this and being a mother in some sense. So he is like her child. I love him too but she is attached to him in a way that is much deeper than what I would say is typical.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nShe does not believe the *allowance* is teaching him anything. It is just her way of doting on him. She knows that he is not associating it with good behavior. So it is not an attempt at teaching him anything. More of \u201che\u2019s been good so we should do something good for him\u201d\n\nEdit 3:\n\nJust going to answer a few more questions by copying my responses.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she get a job?\n\nCertainly something we could look into, and not something she has said she is opposed to at all. We were completely fine before all of this inflation. But everything going up by a little to a lot has really strained us. It took quite a bit of time to even realize it was happening really because we\u2019d had a little bit of a cushion and when you are slowly breaking even or dipping in $10-20 a check I just didn\u2019t realize how little wiggle room we actually had. Now I\u2019m just looking at what expenses are the most frivolous and what I can cut out. So really it\u2019s been the last couple of weeks to a month that I\u2019ve begun stressing about it.\n\nDog allowance?\n\nI do think a lot of people in here are unfairly criticizing her because of the phrasing of \u201cdog\u2019s allowance\u201d this is really her allowance to spend on our dog. I think maybe I\u2019ve done a poor job communicating the finer details which wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she get out more or make friends?\n\nShe does take him to the park and on walks.\n\nBut also, she is very introverted, I have tried suggesting she hang out with her friends more but she rarely ever does. Plus most of her friends have kids now, and she doesn\u2019t admit it but I know it hurts her. A couple of them didn\u2019t even want kids and I think she just feels jealous or like it\u2019s unfair. Not that they have kids but that she can\u2019t.\n\nShe was essentially forced to have an abortion because of a medical issue she didn\u2019t even know she had. I don\u2019t want to go much into it, but it really messed with her. The two most impactful memories I have is the light and joy in her eyes when she found out she was pregnant, and all that joy and light being sucked out when she realized she couldn\u2019t keep it.", "created_utc": 1681862536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r9lb8/aita_for_telling_my_wife_we_can_no_longer_afford/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you say this, you aren't saying anything new to the person, or anything helpful.  \n\nIt is kinder to grieve with the person rather than to offer obvious advice.", "The dog has been doing chores for years.

Even before we had kids and only 1 dog, i wouldn't spend that much on a fur baby. Hell, I don't even spend that much weekly on my kids. They have received enough toys over the years (eldest human kids are 10 & 7) that they don't need new toys every week but can earn them by doing extra chores.\n\nA dog does not need its own bedroom full of chew toys. That is excessive, and I'm a bit concerned for OPs wife mental state with her transference and potential willingness to go broke for the sake of spoiling her dog.\n\nOP, please get her into therapy to make sure she has dealt with the grief of not being able to have children. Then of possible talk to a financial advisor about a new budget and make sure your wife attends this because there have been a few posts lately about partners who have no concept of money and the households budget and expenses.", "Bocces bakery dog treats are all natural ingredients and it\u2019s actual food that\u2019s what we get my dog since my sister recommended it she\u2019s a vet tech and helps with that kind of thing a lot", "Yeah but what would MIL do if she was told she had to cut back on her spending on puppy to avoid going broke.", "All I know is after reading the post and this comment, my husband isnt allowed to say that I spoil my dog anymore.", "Tbf that is a horrible thing to have happen to your Target outfit", "This white lady feels this comment.", "My cats got cat toys for Easter.

Getting pets very expensive toys is just not a smart thing to do. My childhood dog had 1 ball and 1 stick and he was a happy, active boy for 14 years. \n\nMy cats on the other hand need to switch toys out every other day because they get bored constantly. One day they want a feather we found on the ground, the next they want a long leaf, then they'll want a stick on a string.  They will keep you guessing constantly.", "The hard truth is that if you can\u2019t afford to go out to a restaurant because you\u2019re giving your dog an allowance, you\u2019re not doing very well financially.  Your wife sounds immature when it comes to a family budget.  What are you going to do if your dog gets sick and you have to go to the emergency vet?   I had to do that last week, and it was almost $500, after the x-ray, exam and meds.  If you can\u2019t afford to go out to dinner, how are you going to handle that?  Maybe it\u2019s time for your wife to grow up and start putting the dog allowance into a savings account for emergencies and get a job so she can have something to focus her attention on beyond buying more things that the dog doesn\u2019t need.", "She could look into dog enrichment that's easy to do at home. Like \"find the treat\" games and decompression walks. It's good for the dog and can help your relationship with your dog. I do that with my dog bc he just goes through toys way too quickly for me to keep up (he's a power chewer). I guarantee playing with and enriching the dog is gonna do a lot more than buying him treats and toys.", "After reading OP's edits about her medical issue and loss of motherhood I seriously think this is the right answer. All the money going toward the dog's allowance should be put towards therapy and then some. She's really going through a tough time and needs to properly treat it.", "It\u2019s far more likely that your dog is used to a routine, and knows what comes next in the routine. For example: we eat, then go for a walk. Or it\u2019s a mom stays home day bc she\u2019s sitting on the sofa instead of getting ready for work. Regardless of whether they have some sort of sense of time or not, their sense of time is not like a human being\u2019s.", "That's incredibly hard. I agree with this commentor, sounds like her finding part time work could be good for a number of reasons. Maybe she could work with animals rather than people if that's her preference? Or even working at a pet store, she'd also get a discount on treats then. Two or three shifts a week could make a big difference.", "OP, I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.  I think your wife could REALLY benefit from therapy for pregnancy loss - there are therapists specifically trained to deal with this kind of loss and grief.\n\nI won\u2019t lie - I had to terminate for medical reasons last year in the second trimester and my partner thought he was going to lose me for a bit there but I kept insisting I was fine.  I finally wised myself up after like four months of what was turning into a deeper spiral and got into therapy and it\u2019s helped a lot - and I\u2019ve always been wary of therapy personally.\n\nI assume she saw an OB-GYN?  They should have resources and referrals they can give for qualified therapists.  Mine appointments are virtual so I just do them from the comfort of wherever I am at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s a very tough loss to bear.  And I also thought I\u2019d never really want kids and well, as soon as one was unplanned there - I was go go go.  So the loss afterwards when I finally truly felt it hurt a LOT more.  It sounds like rather than processing she\u2019s thrown everything into the dog and forgotten herself along the way.", "Would it be workable to *reduce* the \u201cdog allowance\u201d? \nAnd have different ways of giving the pup a fun adventure on the other weeks? Like a nice long play at a dog park, or a hike in a new place with new smells.", "she might get joy and some extra cash as a dog walker?  I know in my area they are in high demand!", "Actually I think your initial post was written well enough. I think everyone here understands it. I can see how you think she's being attacked, but the scenario you've described is not normal. Sure, some people take their pets to certain stores and buy them things on occasion. But having a set amount each week is next level. Sounds to me like your wife may need an excuse to get out and spend money (known as retail therapy in some cases). Do you have children? Is she projecting anything on the dog by treating it like a child who gets an allowance for doing their chores? Rhetorical questions really. The behavior is, well, just odd to the vast majority of us.", "Definitely not written by a dog", "How insulting to your kids", "Lmao it was my last clean pair of comfortable pants and my last drink of wine at the end of a very long and stressful day.

If your wife wants to make the dog happy, she can throw a Kong for him or take him to the dog park or go for a run.   The dog isn't excited by going to the store.\n\nYour wife wants to lavish affection on him, but she's doing it in ways that make her feel like a good dog mom, instead of doing it in ways that make him feel like a happy dog.\n\nPoint out to her that the rest of the household is cutting back, it's fair for the dog to cut back, too.", ">Hes an idiot though\n\nSo was Nero lol. Nothing going on between those ears unless it was time to play fetch", "she could also consider a part time job at a pet store to get a possible employee discount"]}
