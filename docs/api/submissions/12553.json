I'd spent some money and some other money and I'd had a $20 bill but I broke it spending $1 on a bottle of water at the gas station for my toddler. So I had $19 but I'd also given this kid outside the gas station $2 because ... well I don't remember the sad story, but they had one.\n\nThe pizza I could grab on the way home would have been $15. I was just trying to do some really basic math to figure out if I had enough.\n\n19-2=?\n\nEasy, right? \n\nBut for whatever reason I was starting ... dumbly? Lol.\n\n\"Okay I would have had enough for the pizza EZ because I had $20, so that, minus $15 would have left me with $5, but then I spent...\"\n\nAnd then the toddler throws a toy out of the stroller and I get distracted.\n\nGo back to the math. \"So I had $5 and I was going to get a $15 pizza, so I... no, wait. OKAY, I had $20, and I gave the kid $2, and then there's the $5 I had left... no WAIT\"\n\nAnd then I have to cross a street, so I push the button, watch for traffic etc.\n\nBut eventually I've been walking for like 10 minutes and I still haven't solved this basic math problem.\n\nWhich is especially bad because I used to teach pre-k and kindergarten. Like... this is my *job*.\n\nAnd as I was nearing the pizza place, I walked past this random teenager. And I'm absolutely just... emotionally spent, and I don't even know why. But I knew I'd had $19 when I left the gas station.\n\nSo I said \"How much is 19-2, and is that enough for a $15 pizza?\"\n\nAnd this kid takes a deep breath and looks at me like I'm a lunatic.  And he goes. \"17. And yeah.\" \n\nAnd I said \"Thank you\"\n\nAnd he laughs lightly and says \"what even happened just now?\"\n\nAnd I laughed and said \"I think my brain broke.\"\n\nHe says \"it happens. G'luck\"\n\nAnd I thanked him and went and got a pizza.\n\nNo condescension. No insults. No comparisons.\n\nI'd expect my SO to behave with more courtesy than a random teenager accosted by a disheveled adult in the middle of the street, but... well. That's not what your SO got, is it?\n\nWe don't have to say every thought that pops into our heads out loud. There was no need to compare her to your nephew. \n\nPretty sure YTA", "So, you\u2019ve never had your mind go blank for a moment and forget the simplest of things? I had to Google how yo spell rhythm the other day because, despite the fact that I chart \u201cPatient had a change in heart rhythm\u201d all the time, in that moment I couldn\u2019t figure out how to spell it.

Based on your summary of the situation, it's reasonable to assume you fit in the former category and your SO is the latter. If that's true, she was literally just asking you to do a quick favor for her by doing the calculation in your head. It would have been fine if you had just said \"I don't know,\" but you decided to belittle her by implying that she's less smart than a child. Once again, YTA.", "LMAO YTA. I have multiple degrees in a math-adjacent field and still ask my partner for mental math when I\u2019m feeling especially tired and lazy. Sometimes people\u2019s brains just break temporarily!", "I used to teach first semester calculus and college algebra at the local community college. I'm a self professed math nerd and mental arithmetic is my thing. When I'm driving and there's nothing good on the radio I'll calculate the volume of a torus in my head to pass the time. It's just who I am.\n\nBut there are times I say \"Alexa, what's seventeen plus fourteen?\"\n\nSome days I just can't math. I'm too tired, my mind is too busy to focus, or my attention is on other things. Maybe I'm too invested in what's happening in my right hemisphere to let my left hemisphere have a crack at it.

Not because I don't know how to math, but because some days it just feels like too much work.\n\nVery soft YTA because your intentions weren't cruel, but when someone you care about is struggling don't mock them next time, help them.", "YTA- she was doing other stuff and asked you a quick math question so she didn\u2019t have to think about it. My husband and I do that all the time and he\u2019s an engineer.

NAH.", "NTA\n\nThis sub sometimes... \n\nYes it was a stupid question, what I find more surprising is how defensive she got to the point of storming out since you didn't even push the subject... most people would've laughed call it a brain freeze and move on.

Being shit at math does not make someone an asshole, but mocking them does.", "NTA.\n\nPeople in this thread are acting like you asked her to recite Schrodingers equations or some shit.\n\nIt's 55+7, if you have the bravery to ask another human being what that is, you should be expecting some level of light ribbing in response. It's not even math, It's literally just counting. You can do it on your fingers lol.\n\nAssuming your comment about the way you said it is truthful, all you did was very lightly poke fun at someone who asked you a incredibly dumb question. If she can't laugh at herself for that, then what *can* she laugh at herself about?", "That IS a pretty silly question to ask someone. But this is the moment for light teasing or going \"62! Hahaha, whaaat?\" not comparing her to a child and then letting it pass when she says you must think she's stupid. YTA for that.", "Yeah, not wanting to math at the moment is a totally valid thing. \ud83e\udd23 I feel that.", "NTA. Math doesn't get much more basic than this.", "YTA - You\u2019re right, she asked you a basic math question \u2014 at your big age, you should be able to answer it without the condescending attitude.", "YTA.\n\nI struggle with math and if you asked me what 55+7 was, I wouldn\u2019t even know. Yeah, it\u2019s basic math and anyone can do it but if you have learning disabilities, it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019ll struggle doing math without the use of a calculator.\n\nAlso, you sound incredibly condescending when you told her \u201canyone can do it, even your little nephew\u201d. It makes it sound like she\u2019s stupid and you\u2019re smarter.", "You know damn well that your SO knows how to do that math herself, come on now. She knows that too.

You were fine until you said your nephew could do it.", "NTA there is this as one little phone app called a calculator if her mind blanked. An alternative would also be using seven fingers to count up from 55.", "NTA. Come on now.", "YTA, mildly.  Sometimes people's brains are full and they just need someone else to do a little thinking for them.", "I once had a (very nice) doctor who would ask me grade- level and below trivia to distract me from things that hurt. \nThe man was kind enough not to treat me as an idiot because i successfully proved that as a19 year old i could still recite poetry but i can NOT multiply or name state capitals while in pain. \n(Honestly, nearly 20 years later, i think it's still true) \n\nYou were obnoxious and condescending when you were asked a question. (Which could have been as simple as not being able to think with her hands full or double checking mental math when it's important)\n\nShe was clearly hurt and that made her volitile with her response to you\n\nESH\n\nBut honestly, if i were her i world never ever EVER ask you to fill in a data point again. And while the couple might not know it then, that inability to be vulnerable would doom a relationship.\nYou might want to consider why she felt this attacked by you- how frequently do you say things that make her feel small?", "My husband does that type of shit to me. I actually got pretty far in math; but I have to look at the problem on paper. I can\u2019t do it in my head like him and apparently you. YTA math is hard. It uses several different skills, working together to solve a problem\n\nVisual processing: Your eyes see the entirety of the math problem and send the components back to your brain for processing.\n\nShort-term memory: You use your short-term memory to hold onto the specifics of the math problem as you work on it. For example, the number amounts, the symbols and the order in which they appear.\n\nLanguage: You use this part of your brain to translate the symbols in the math problem into what those symbols mean. That\u2019s how you know what the plus sign, equal sign and question mark mean in this context.\n\nLong-term memory: You access this kind of memory to remember the process of how to solve a math problem. In this case, your brain identifies that this is an addition problem based on the plus sign and the equals sign.\n\nUnderstanding of quantities and amounts: Your brain translates the symbol \u201c2\u201d into the understanding that it represents a specific amount or quantity. Children usually learn this principle by giving them examples like fruits or animals.\n\nCalculation: This process unites all of the above, helping you solve that 2+2=4.\n\nFor a neurotypical person, the above processes all work as expected. But, for people who are neurodiverse, there could be many different factors, like tiredness, that makes all these processes not perform. You should apologize.", "Light ESH.\n\nSometimes you just can't brain.... You could have been kinder. But she also overreacted.", "Is this the famous weaponized incompetence I keep hearing about?

Gotta deal with it.", "Idk. Kids are often better at basic math like this because they have to practice it more often than a lot of adults do. Maybe she had a long day and her brain was just on screensaver mode. It happens.\n\nI\u2019m going with ESH. You didn\u2019t have to compare her to your nephew but she also didn\u2019t have to get super defensive.", "It happens.
