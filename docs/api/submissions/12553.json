I'd spent some money and some other money and I'd had a $20 bill but I broke it spending $1 on a bottle of water at the gas station for my toddler. So I had $19 but I'd also given this kid outside the gas station $2 because ... well I don't remember the sad story, but they had one.\n\nThe pizza I could grab on the way home would have been $15. I was just trying to do some really basic math to figure out if I had enough.\n\n19-2=?\n\nEasy, right? \n\nBut for whatever reason I was starting ... dumbly? Lol.\n\n\"Okay I would have had enough for the pizza EZ because I had $20, so that, minus $15 would have left me with $5, but then I spent...\"\n\nAnd then the toddler throws a toy out of the stroller and I get distracted.\n\nGo back to the math. \"So I had $5 and I was going to get a $15 pizza, so I... no, wait. OKAY, I had $20, and I gave the kid $2, and then there's the $5 I had left... no WAIT\"\n\nAnd then I have to cross a street, so I push the button, watch for traffic etc.\n\nBut eventually I've been walking for like 10 minutes and I still haven't solved this basic math problem.\n\nWhich is especially bad because I used to teach pre-k and kindergarten. Like... this is my *job*.\n\nAnd as I was nearing the pizza place, I walked past this random teenager. And I'm absolutely just... emotionally spent, and I don't even know why. But I knew I'd had $19 when I left the gas station.\n\nSo I said \"How much is 19-2, and is that enough for a $15 pizza?\"\n\nAnd this kid takes a deep breath and looks at me like I'm a lunatic.  And he goes. \"17. And yeah.\" \n\nAnd I said \"Thank you\"\n\nAnd he laughs lightly and says \"what even happened just now?\"\n\nAnd I laughed and said \"I think my brain broke.\"\n\nHe says \"it happens. G'luck\"\n\nAnd I thanked him and went and got a pizza.\n\nNo condescension. No insults.

I actually got pretty far in math; but I have to look at the problem on paper. I can\u2019t do it in my head like him and apparently you. YTA math is hard. It uses several different skills, working together to solve a problem\n\nVisual processing: Your eyes see the entirety of the math problem and send the components back to your brain for processing.\n\nShort-term memory: You use your short-term memory to hold onto the specifics of the math problem as you work on it. For example, the number amounts, the symbols and the order in which they appear.\n\nLanguage: You use this part of your brain to translate the symbols in the math problem into what those symbols mean. That\u2019s how you know what the plus sign, equal sign and question mark mean in this context.\n\nLong-term memory: You access this kind of memory to remember the process of how to solve a math problem. In this case, your brain identifies that this is an addition problem based on the plus sign and the equals sign.\n\nUnderstanding of quantities and amounts: Your brain translates the symbol \u201c2\u201d into the understanding that it represents a specific amount or quantity. Children usually learn this principle by giving them examples like fruits or animals.\n\nCalculation: This process unites all of the above, helping you solve that 2+2=4.\n\nFor a neurotypical person, the above processes all work as expected. But, for people who are neurodiverse, there could be many different factors, like tiredness, that makes all these processes not perform.
