Thanks for the follow up.", "congrats!", "Congratulations!!", "Congratulations! This sounds like the best scenario given your sister's struggles... Your daughter has a stable loving home that will support her building a relationship with her birth mom, as your sister is ready and able.", "Wonderful news, congratulations!", "Congratulations!!!!", "Congratulations!  That is a wonderful update!", "Congratulations! thank you for following up!", "Happy News!!! I will be smiling about this all weekend :)", "\u201cSara\u201d is such a lucky girl.", "That's awesome! Congratulations!", "Congratulations! I remember your original post and I am glad that your family now has the security not to be ripped apart sometime in the future. This is just the best outcome for your little girl.", "\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Made your day", "Congratulations!", "Congratulations!", "Yay for you. That's awesome news.", "Congrats! *HUGS!*", "That\u2019s fantastic news", "This just made me feel all warm and fuzzy. Congratulations to you and your growing family! Thank you for being there to take on Sara and giving her a shot at a stable loving home/life.", "Congratulations!", "Congratulations!!", "I am so happy to know that Sara is going to be in a stable, loving environment with you and your wife. Kudos to you and wifey! Congratulations!!", "I remember being accused of the same thing with my four adopted daughters. \n\n6 years later and the birth parents still haven't even tried to make contact with them, not that 3 of them would even remember them anyway.", "Oh yay!!! And in this, the month of our Pride, too! Just lovely", "Please make sure you get your daughter the lifelong support she\u2019ll need as an adoptee. Every adoption is born of trauma.", "She's the blessing, actually", "That sucks. You did steal her from your sister. I\u2019m sorry your wife can\u2019t have her own but you only gave Jane 6 months and then you felt entities to her daughter? That\u2019s wild. No wonder she didn\u2019t want to leave her with you. You guys were baby hungry. Sign any papers you want. Jane will always be her mother, and when she gets it together, sara may want to be with her real mother.", "Congrats!!! That\u2019s great news, thanks for sharing such a nice update", "Congratulations!", "Happy days, OP!\n\n\nFantastic news!", "Congrats OP!!", "Congratulations!", "Congratulations \ud83c\udf8a", "Congratulations!!! \ud83c\udf89 \u2764\ufe0f happy for you guys and for Sara!", "Congratulations \ud83c\udf7e", "That's very positive to hear, you helped that kid dodge some mental health bullets.  Hope everything stays well for your family!", "Happy for you, congratulations!!", "congrats!", "And if the baby is better off with OP? Jane may be an unfit mother", "\"Stealing\"!?!? The poor child was left on their doorstep, the birth mother and father voluntarily gave up the rights. \n\nKids deserve a stable home and parents that want them. Jane is just an egg donor at this point.", "Oh, indeed. But her life would be very, very different if her two moms hadn\u2019t fought for her. I still contend she\u2019s a lucky girl", "Congratulations! After reading your last posts and edits, I want to insure you and everyone with questions that you did the right thing.\n\nI wish I could adopt my daughter. It's been 9.5 years and her birth mom has a 3.5 year old. I also thought taking her in would be temporary. I'm single and only on social security (1,000/month) and food stamps ($200). I don't qualify for any other benefits because I haven't adopted her. Her birth father has 17 other children. \n\nThere have been long periods where we didn't hear from her mom. Her mom's family accused me of keeping her away. She's had her own cellphone since she was 4, they still don't call. We only confirmed who her father is recently. He's still too busy being a rolling stone. \n\nAs for why you didn't take your sister in, I found drugs in my home. I had strange people calling and knocking on my door. I've never used any illegal substances and rarely drink alcohol. I didn't want this around the place that is supposed to bring me peace. \n\nEnjoy your newly expanded family and the security you've given YOUR daughter!", "Congrats!!! \n\nI read your update wrong first, read your story, and then was like \u201cwait.. she took her from you after all\u2026?\u201d \n\nNOPE!!!\n\n\nGlad sara gets to stay with those she\u2019s familiar with \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "I am interested but not enough to read", "That\u2019s amazing!  What\u2019s even better is that June 28th is my birthday!  Two great things happening on that day!  Congratulations!!!!", "To Sara, congratulations on having a loving home and caring parents!\n\nTo OP, I am hoping that sister and her husband can straighten their lived out and become part of Sara's family, and I am very happy for your new addition to your family!", "Congratulations", "That's great to hear. How have things been with your sister? Is she making any progress? Has she been trying to see your daughter at all? I'd love an update on her life.", "Congratulations OP! I was adopted by family when I was a baby, and while I definitely should have gotten therapy when I first found out, it\u2019s still the best thing that could have happened to me. I owe my whole life to my parents. Thank you for caring so much for her and making sure her best interests come first.", "Congratulations", "Congratulations!! I just wanted to say that I read the original post and wanted to let you know that you\u2019ve done everything correct imo. Taking your niece, de facto daughter, from the situation your sister was in was the absolute right thing to do. At this point there\u2019s really nothing you could have done differently because I believe this was what was best for \u201cSara\u201d", "Congrats on successfully \"stealing\" your sister's baby.", "I can feel the love you and your wife have for her. You will be the best moms to her, I can tell. I hope you have the time of your life with your family \u2764\ufe0f", "Damn, you are telling me this post was 5 months ago? Time does fly. I'm very happy for you and your family!", "Oh wow how did your sister have such a big change of heart? What happened?", "Yay for happy ending!", "Yay! The best news I\u2019ve seen today.", "Thank you for the update!!! The very best wishes for you and \u2018Sara\u2019 \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Yikes", "Did Jane write this post?", "That was nearly a year ago. In what works does protecting this child from a traumatic childhood a bad thing?? Plus the parents signed her over to them. That is NOT stealing their baby.", "I honestly have no idea. We met with a lawyer and were ready for anything, but when we opened up the conversation with them, they immediately agreed. My wife and I were extremely shocked, but grateful. The minute they left, we both burst into tears. We were so ready for it to go bad.", "Maybe a lawyer told her the reality of her situation that reunification was unlikely and even if it did go that way she would have to put in the work pass drugs tests etc"]}
