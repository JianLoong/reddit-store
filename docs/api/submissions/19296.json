The poor child was left on their doorstep, the birth mother and father voluntarily gave up the rights. \n\nKids deserve a stable home and parents that want them. Jane is just an egg donor at this point.", "Oh, indeed. But her life would be very, very different if her two moms hadn\u2019t fought for her. I still contend she\u2019s a lucky girl"]}
