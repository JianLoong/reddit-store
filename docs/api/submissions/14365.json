Our house is quite big and besides the guest room we have another spare room (it's usually empty/ used as storage, but we use it as extra bedroom when needed)\n\nSo my sister is supposed to come next week and stay for 2/3 weeks to a month. I told her they are both welcomed and that we would prepare both bedrooms for them. My sister said they can just share, but I'm not okay with that. I am religious, I found the path of god after the lost of a grandparent and a dear friend some years ago. My sister is not religious and that's okay, but I feel that since she will be staying in my house completely free then I have a say in who sleeps in which room. \n\nMy sister is annoyed and she said they won't do anything inappropriate in my house, she tried to pressure me into letting them stay in the same room. I gently explained why that was not ok for me over and over again. At last I was annoyed, and I told that this is my house and my rules, if she doesn't likes it then she can stay somewhere else (find an Airbnb or a motel). I told her that I love her and it makes me happy that she would visit us, but that my rules should be respected in my own house. She's now angry at me and threatening to not visit at all. Am I wrong here?

I don\u2019t want to speak for Judaism because I am not educated on the Torah. \n\nIt\u2019s true that there are plenty of religions that do not take the same stance, but ~55% of the world population identify as either Christian or Muslim. Obviously, not all of those are going to be religious zealots who practice to the letter of the book, but it\u2019s not really a stretch to generalize broadly based on religions which appeal to more than half of the world\u2019s population.", "Also adding that not all Christians are the same. I grew up Catholic (a type of Christian) and now attend an Episcopal Church (slightly different flavor of Christian) where my lesbian aunts are welcomed with open arms, women hold clergy positions and preach, and the main minister (Dean of the Cathedral) is a gay man. Also people who get divorced, have premarital sex, use birth control are not judged/shamed for this. I like it wayyy better than the Catholic Church that I grew up in. \n\nAlthough the church service feels similar, the values are wildly different.", "I can sleep in the same bed with my husband and not have sex. Sleeping in the same bed does not mean they're going to have sex. Before we were married us sleeping in the same bed didn't mean we were fucking all night long.", "Well yes, if you count the mini religions with <1 million followers worldwide, then you'll probably find one where a member hasn't killed someone else because of religious reasons YET. (Although it's probably only a matter of time).\n\nAnd I think it's pretty common sense that words like \"all\" or \"none\" are still applicable when they are \"only\" valid for 99% of the subject.\n\nReligion is the cancer of humanity.", "Yeah, Buddhists promote non-violence, but there are tons of examples where they were pretty violent, including murder, against people who don't share their believes, especially muslims (who often do the same to buddhists or followers of other religions).\nSo much peace among the religious folks...", "I've even heard that sex can be had at 8am, 11am, 1pm, 3pm, and a few other times. Outside of a bed too! It's wild!", "Thank you. \n\nI'm so glad it was a mistake and not the conclusion I jumped to. I was a tad concerned someone along the line told you that sharing a bed meant you had an obligation to sleep with them.", "Neither one is an asshole, you\u2019re perfectly within your rights to set rules at your own house, doesn\u2019t mean family is wrong for not visiting either.", "Religious rules are enforced on you when you walk into the door. That cannot be argued.", "Nothing wrong with religious education. Problems start with indoctrination.", "Right, and if we stop erasing the other 45%, which is a huge percentage, and stop enabling them to pretend they're the only ones who exist, there will be a huge culture shift. Maybe anyway. It's worth a shot.", "This is true but it turns into the \"not all men\" argument. Everyone with logic knows it can't be all. But it's so predominant that the percentage of non toxic Christians is not enough to offset the rest, and your energy would be better spent addressing the people giving you a bad name than it is splitting hairs.", "Fact checked and that's true. Bad example but there's still millions of religions out there and it's really presumptuous and arrogant to pretend we know each one. Also I have to ask how much is the fault of the doctrines of a specific. religion and how much is the fault of people just sucking because people suck. Like did someone do something because the literal translation of their holy text said they had to, or did they twist it because they wanted to be violent? The Bible is already a very violent bookend doesn't have to be twisted. \n\nThe main point here though was let's not pretend we know everything because it's a great way to look silly later.", "on thursdays, you can have it at 9:30 (am or pm)", "I don't think you can do one without encroaching on the other. Religious education requires information to be skewed by belief. Unfortunately, all American schools are so geared toward indoctrination that Hitler sent people here to take notes. So on that hand it's so far gone it doesn't matter.", "Religious Ed is indoctrination. I went for 5 years.", "I don\u2019t disagree. IMO the world would be a much better place if we somehow all agreed that religion was a personal choice and a personal choice alone.", "Many many Christians are assholes who try to justify their prudishness and homophobia with \u201creligion\u201d \n\nA few are not.\n\nI am not a Christian, technically, so I\u2019m not defending myself in this case. I don\u2019t believe all the Jesus Son of God born of a Virgin stuff but I get paid to sing in churches and I find my own spirituality in singing. \n\nI just have had an opportunity to see how a lot of Christians worship and I know they aren\u2019t all like the Catholics and Mormons that I grew up around. Just sharing my perspective, and definitely not defending assholes who use religion to justify their hatred of others.", "Depends on what you define as religious education. My view was education about religion, and i think in your case is education with religion."]}
