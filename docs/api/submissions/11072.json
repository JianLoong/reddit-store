They have the same dad and he\u2019s not involved in their lives. Their moms became close friends and they were raised seeing one another. Malcolm\u2019s mom moved abroad a couple of years ago. \n\nElena\u2019s mom \u201cSandra\u201d was diagnosed with cancer last year. She went through treatment but it\u2019s been determined that there\u2019s nothing they can do but make her comfortable. Sandra will pass sometime this year. She has no family. Malcolm has spent a lot of time helping care for Elena, driving her to school, making them meals, etc. \n\nRecently, Malcolm sat me down. He said that Sandra asked to speak to him. She said she understood if the answer was no but asked for him to take on custody of Elena, sooner rather than later that way she could adjust to him being her guardian before she passes. Malcolm would move in with them. Sandra had a sizable life insurance policy and an account to help him care for Elena.\n\nTo my surprise, he agreed to all of this without consulting me. I pointed this out and he said we\u2019ve only been together 6 months. I asked didn\u2019t he feel too young for all this. He said sort of, but he\u2019d do it for Elena. Without further discussion, he subleased his apartment and moved in with Sandra and Elena. \n\nSaturday, I stopped by to pick up Malcolm for lunch. He hadn\u2019t returned from work yet so I was waiting with Sandra. We were making small talk. She mentioned how grateful she was for Malcolm and that he was a sweet boy. I asked if he was really her only option. I mentioned his mom. Sandra said Elena is losing enough, she doesn\u2019t want to force her to move abroad on top of everything. She also doesn\u2019t feel right asking Malcolm\u2019s mom to move back. \n\nI said I found the whole thing a little selfish. Malcolm is only 22. He shouldn\u2019t be tied down raising a child. Sandra got defensive and said she wished she didn\u2019t have to ask him, plus he said yes. I asked what else was he supposed to say. Sandra told me I was upsetting her and asked me to leave.\n\nMalcolm called me later, screaming at me. He said that I upset Sandra. I said I was trying to defend him and point out options she may not have thought of. Malcolm told me to butt out and to get on board with this or walk away. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. I saw Elena at the mall on Sunday and she ignored me.\n\nMy mom told me I screwed up big time.

You do realize your boyfriend is a grown man capable of deciding his future?   \n\n\nWhat's selfish is you going to a dying mother, guilting her into something no one wants. No one wants a person to die. No one wants to leave a child due to CANCER.   \n\n\nThis is just a guess, but I assume **you** don't want the 12yo in **your** life.", "Yep, you're YTA. Very much the AH.", "I hope Malcolm is listening while you're telling him who you really are... someone who has no issue going around him,  someone who thinks she knows better how his life should be, someone with no compassion. \n\nYTA. And frankly, nowhere near the caliber of person Malcolm deserves.", "YTA holy jesus!\n\nHave you stopped for just a moment to consider that it's not about you? You asked for his opinion and he said he thought it through and this is what he decided to do. At first I thought you asked because you were worried about him but it's pretty obvious you were only thinking about yourself. Malcolm is right. You've been together for 6 months. They grew up together. Your opinion doesn't matter at all and it wouldn't even if it came from genuine concern for your boyfriend.\n\nThe worst part is that you put the whole thing on a dying woman for fucks sake. Don't you think she feels guilty enough for leaving a child behind and asking Malcolm to take care of her? You also caused unnecessary stress to your bf on top everything he's dealing with. You're not only an asshole but also really selfish, self-centered and cruel. I wouldn't be surprised if he broke up with you over this. Hell, I don't say things like this but I even hope he does. They'd be better off without you.", "YTA I honestly hope he dumps you. This is none of your business having dated a laughable 6 months.", "YTA for that conversation, but honestly I probably would have cut my losses with Malcom and called it a day.

Of course it is a huge undertaking but you should respect him enough to recognize he knows best for himself. This is just dripping with insecurity and self-centeredness on your part.

The woman has terminal cancer and you're coming at her for it.", "YTA, this has nothing to do with you. He has expressed to you his willingness to take on this responsibility. You are not required to stay in the relationship if the dynamic change is not okay with you, but interfering in his life and calling Sandra selfish was beyond AH behavior.", "YTA\n\nDo you think if this poor DYING mother had another option, she would\u2019ve asked him?

You may have just blown your relationship with him, but that is just as well, he found out what you are like early.  YTA", "YTA. Malcolm is an adult and he made an adult decision. \n\nYou have a right to whatever feelings you have, especially since he only told you as an afterthought (meaning it would have been kinder to have discussed everything with you before he moved in - not that he should have changed his mind for you), and a right to share those feelings with Malcolm. You had *no right* to say any of that to Sandra. She's already dying and grappling with leaving her daughter forever. You need to learn empathy. \n\nYour options were to accept this new reality in your relationship or end it. I'm surprised frankly that Malcolm is still leaving this up to you and hasn't broken up with you.", "YTA. It's fine that you're worried for Malcom and think he's too young BUT harassing a dying woman and trying to guilt her is way, way out of line.

Honestly, what the fuck is up with you, that you think the life of a whole ass human being is less important than you being comfortable? Your boyfriend is right, you've only been together 6 months, and this is his sister. If I were him I would kick you to the curb, and take care of my sister. Hell, I would take in the child of an acquaintance, if they thought I would be the best person to care for them. OP, I know you feel like you are looking out for him and have his best interest at heart, but really, it's only about you. Your boyfriend sounds like a good man, jury might still be out on you OP.", "YTA- you harassed a dying woman about her decision because you felt inconvenienced in your 6 month relationship. It wasn't your place to do that and obviously your boyfriend doesn't agree with your view on the situation. I think you could expect him to end it with you over this, if it was your sister then you'd probably feel different. You made a poor choice.", "YTA. You've been with him for 6 months and want a say in his personal affairs? Seriously? And not only that but you go as far as to take matter into your own hands and tell someone who is dying that shes selfish?? Newsflash Darling...YOU are the selfish one and your actions are nothing short of unwarranted and absolutely disgusting. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Yeah not sure on any world you\u2019d find yourself not a major AH for doing this. YTA This is zero of your business. Let me repeat: zero of your business. You\u2019ve been together six months and you want to call the shots in his life? And have the audacity to go to a dying woman and emotionally manipulate her like that?

Quite frankly, you sound like a truly awful person.\n\nYou\u2019ve been together six months; you\u2019re barely even his girlfriend. Little more than a date. Hopefully he\u2019ll see the error he made in spending time with you and will choose someone with empathy.", "YTA you crossed a major line when you've been in his life for 6 months vs Sandra and Elena being present for 12 years. Plus what a shitty thing to do, bringing it up to a dying woman as a virtual outsider to her family situation. You shouldn't have brought it up at all, but if you had to you should have at least brought it up solely with Malcolm instead of going behind his back. Nobody is asking you to commit to being part of Elena's life, which is what it sounds like you're really worried about.", "YTA.\n\nI swear to God, if I see one N T A on this thread, I\u2019ll lose my faith in humanity.\n\nYou should listen to your mother. Sounds like she\u2019s a smart woman.\n\nMalcolm got lucky. He Just got a glimpse into your soul when you let your mask slip. It is twisted under there. And cruel.\n\nFor God\u2019s sake, harassing a dying woman? Really? And shameless about it no less.\n\nLucky for him he saw that early on and hasn\u2019t spent years of his life with you.

Thanks for the upvotes.", "YTA", "YTA. Malcom is in a very difficult situation to navigate, but it is HIS situation to navigate. Not yours. Your relationship of (checks notes) 6 months gives you no say, no veto rights, and really not even consultation status. \n\nIt is his decision whether he feels he can step up or not. Is this life changing? Absolutely. But it is really a life changing decision either way. It is for him to decide if taking care of his sister is the best solution. Plenty of people younger than him have become caregivers. It sounds like he understands what is at stake, and has made an informed decision.  At this point your only role is to either support him or walk away", "Wow dude! Your single for sure now.", "YTA and congrats on likely being the ex-girlfriend.  He didn't ask you to defend him and he's right, you've only been together for 6 months.  Worse, you've shown yourself to be quite awful in going after a woman dying of cancer.", "Do you know how many people are already parents at 22? On top of that starting with raising a tween is way easier than dealing with an infant. He's willing to put in the work to make sure his SISTER is taken care of. Why do you feel like you need to step in if he feels perfectly capable of handling the situation?  YTA and made a dying woman feel guilty about making sure her daughter would be taken care of by family. Dear God I hope you don't ever get cancer because you wouldn't get any sympathy from me.", "Your use of \"selfish\" in the title while being the most selfish person on the planet drove my soul to leave my body.

What on earth.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nHOW DARE YOU. You had no right whatsoever to stick your unwarranted option in that dying woman's face. Few times have I been repulsed in this sub. You are single. And good riddance.", "YTA and single too. You guys were only dating six months. Your relationship is a blip in the grand scheme of Malcolms life. Elena will always be his sister. You fucked up.

Your boyfriend sounds like a good person. Either accept who he is and support him or get out of his life.", "YTA: you have been dating him for only 6 months. You're not married or even engaged.

Well, most likely ex-boyfriend now. \n\nI choose to be childfree but if I had a family member who was dying and I was the only person who they trusted to care for their child, I'd do it.

You've only been around 6 months and you have the audacity to expect more? The only selfish one here is you. You lack empathy and honestly you should just walk away and save him the trouble. You're clearly too immature and don't understand putting someone you love first because it's the right thing to do. Wow. Grow up.", "YTA and you're the one being selfish. You aren't thinking of Malcolm, you're thinking of yourself. 6 months isn't long enough to be as important as you think you are. Grow up.", "Lol none of this happened", "YTA. It is Malcolm\u2019s decision. You can dislike the situation, but you have no right whatsoever to dictate whether or not he\u2019s too young to take on the responsibility.

She has to be in the sense as she has to look after her child. So shit up about the selfishness. This isn't some norm situation.

I get the impression that it\u2019s you. You talk about it not being fair to saddle Malcom with a child, but it sounds like you don\u2019t want your boyfriend to be distracted.

It's not your place to judge Malcolm's decision to become Elena's guardian or to question Sandra's motives for asking him. This is a difficult situation for everyone involved, and Malcolm made a decision to help care for his half-sister during a time of need. While you may have concerns about the impact this will have on your relationship, it's not fair to call Sandra selfish or question Malcolm's ability to take on this responsibility. Instead of causing more stress and upset, it would be better to offer your support and try to find ways to help make this transition easier for everyone involved.", "YTA - Seriously?", "I really cannot fathom how you made it through typing that without realizing what a massive AH you are.

Who do you think you are?!!!", "YTA. You've been with him 6 months...you don't call the shots and \"step in\" when he didn't ask or even need you to.

Just wow", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s not your business what Malcolm decides.

This just feels like a lot of projection.", "YTA. At 22, I would have gladly taken in all 5 of my brothers if I needed to. You and Malcolm seem to have very different values and priorities.  At least this has made Malcolm see who you are inside.", "Ew. YTA and you over stepped big time. You've been in the picture for 30 seconds why would you think your opinion was valid? Why would you think it's ok to even bring it up. Good news is you won't have to worry about it since I'm sure you're gonna be out of the picture anyway.", "YTA.

I hope your boyfriend dumps you and runs for the hills.", "FWIW, You aren't worried about \"Malcolm\" you're worried about \"you and Malcolm\" and are not willing to be a \"step-mom\" to a 12 yo girl. So it's time for you to move on and find someone else. I'm guessing if he was already a single dad 6 months ago you wouldn't have looked twice at him, right... \n\nYTA. I had my own kids at 22/23 and it is certainly not too young for those who take it seriously. Malcolm sounds wonderful and I hope he finds a better partner than you.", "Wooooow YTA.  And soon to be single.\n\nThis woman is dying and setting her affairs in order and you called her selfish?\n\nYou\u2019ve only been dating this guy for 6 months.  You had absolutely no right.", "YTA. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t selfish of her to ask. It would have been selfish for her to insist if he didn\u2019t want to, which clearly isn\u2019t what happened.\n\nYou know what is selfish? You, trying to rudely control and insert yourself into this family you barely know, and judging them for their decisions. \n\nI think it\u2019s absolutely wonderful and beautiful that Malcom is selflessly taking on this responsibility.

As it should be.\n\nYTA. An enormous one.\n\n\n.", "YTA. This arrangement does not concern you. If Malcolm had issues with it, he can discuss it with Sandra.

It was a done deal and there was no reason for you to open your big mouth. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Notvto mention insensitive and heartless.  The woman is DYING. You really think that she wouldn't rather be around to help her child grow up? She can't,  so she goes to the next option,  which is Malcom. He's mature enough to accept the responsibility of this girl.  He's going to lose someone very close to him. And your only concern is for yourself? \n\nThis was none of your business.  6 months doesn't give you a say in anything, much less anything this important. YTA .", "YTA: Who are you top even behave this way? You've known this man for 6 months. He is not your family. Elena is and Sandra have been apart of his life since the day Elena was born. It's HIS life and he wants to support his sister.", "YTA - you're both young so I'm going to cut you some slack for being dumb, but you're not his wife, haven't even been dating long, and have no business butting into his family life.

Are you for real?", "How can you NOT see that YTA. That's his SISTER. You've only been with him 6 months and he's known her for YEARS. Of course he's gonna take her in. I would too. I almost had too.

If you don't like the decision, leave.", "YTA - After 6 months you think you get to have any say on this lol", "Jesus. Yes, yta. Even if there were some validity to your concerns 1. It's not your place and 2. You went about discussing them with your bf in a shitty way.

I don\u2019t think you even considered that Malcolm likely does not want his sister going to anyone else. It\u2019s his sister. That\u2019s his blood, his family, a little kid he has been looking out for since he was 10 years old. He held her as a baby, so he knows what he\u2019s doing here.

Malcolm made a choice that he is ok with. Your feelings about it are absolutely meaningless. He isn't obligated to consult you and you were way out of line to say anything to Sandra about her request. Though young, Malcolm is a grown man capable of making his own choices. You have no right to undermine that. On top of all that you are completely lacking in compassion. Sandra is critically ill and facing the fact that she will not live out the year.

Holy hell woman. What is wrong with you?", "YTA in a super colossal way. It\u2019s not like Elena is a baby or toddler. She\u2019s 12. Very capable. It\u2019s not like Malcolm is becoming a teen parent. And they\u2019ll have the financial backing. You need to take about 10 steps back and seriously think about what you\u2019ve done.

They have the same dad and he\u2019s not involved in their lives. Their moms became close friends and they were raised seeing one another. Malcolm\u2019s mom moved abroad a couple of years ago. \n\nElena\u2019s mom \u201cSandra\u201d was diagnosed with cancer last year. She went through treatment but it\u2019s been determined that there\u2019s nothing they can do but make her comfortable. Sandra will pass sometime this year. She has no family. Malcolm has spent a lot of time helping care for Elena, driving her to school, making them meals, etc. \n\nRecently, Malcolm sat me down. He said that Sandra asked to speak to him. She said she understood if the answer was no but asked for him to take on custody of Elena, sooner rather than later that way she could adjust to him being her guardian before she passes. Malcolm would move in with them. Sandra had a sizable life insurance policy and an account to help him care for Elena.\n\nTo my surprise, he agreed to all of this without consulting me. I pointed this out and he said we\u2019ve only been together 6 months. I asked didn\u2019t he feel too young for all this. He said sort of, but he\u2019d do it for Elena. Without further discussion, he subleased his apartment and moved in with Sandra and Elena. \n\nSaturday, I stopped by to pick up Malcolm for lunch. He hadn\u2019t returned from work yet so I was waiting with Sandra. We were making small talk. She mentioned how grateful she was for Malcolm and that he was a sweet boy. I asked if he was really her only option. I mentioned his mom. Sandra said Elena is losing enough, she doesn\u2019t want to force her to move abroad on top of everything. She also doesn\u2019t feel right asking Malcolm\u2019s mom to move back. \n\nI said I found the whole thing a little selfish. Malcolm is only 22. He shouldn\u2019t be tied down raising a child. Sandra got defensive and said she wished she didn\u2019t have to ask him, plus he said yes. I asked what else was he supposed to say. Sandra told me I was upsetting her and asked me to leave.\n\nMalcolm called me later, screaming at me. He said that I upset Sandra. I said I was trying to defend him and point out options she may not have thought of. Malcolm told me to butt out and to get on board with this or walk away. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. I saw Elena at the mall on Sunday and she ignored me.\n\nMy mom told me I screwed up big time. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don't have a familial relationship with this teen.\n\nBut he can choose this for himself. He has chosen this.  If you cannot respect it then you need to move on.  Or he may choose to move on from you so you can find someone who is more to your preference.\n\nSince you went behind his back and confronted the other family members this probably is unrecoverable.

You went behind your boyfriend\u2019s back after he already made the decision and confronted a dying woman, causing her what had to be immense stress when her body doesn\u2019t need it. \n\nYour mom\u2019s assessment was an understatement.", "YTA.  1) Your viewpoint on this is highly selfish. 2) The fact that you broached this topic with Sandra show's you don't know boundaries. and 3) It is his place to decide what is right for him.

This woman is dying and likely worried sick about what's going to happen to her child after she's gone and she's got some rando who's been around for six months calling her selfish.\n\nLet him go and don't try to contact them again.

Yes, only half siblings, but still.

Maybe you're just super immature.", "YTA he already decided he was doing this and yes he really should of discussed it with you first but clearly that wasn\u2019t important for him to do so when he told you what he was going to do that when you needed to decide if that what you wanted to be involved in or not and if it was no break up with him not go and harass a woman dyeing of cancer", "YTA. Although I can agree with your view point that this is a LOT of responsibility for a 22 year old, sometimes life forces you to grow up real quick, and I think this is one of those scenarios for your boyfriend. Additionally, you had no place for an opinion here, unless you were asked. This is between your boyfriend and his family. You've only been dating 6 months, and unless you're living together, I don't see how your opinion matters. What's next for you is to decide if this is a situation you're comfortable with, as your relationship will now obviously change with Elena in the picture.

But you are definitely TA here.", "YTA and WTF is wrong with you?", "YTA \n\nThis has NOTHING to do with you, you literally have NO say in this matter. He is not your spouse or long term partner, he is your boyfriend of 6 months. You are sticking your nose into business that has nothing to do with you. Why should he consult you over something that has to do with his family, again you have only been around for 6 months, not 6 years. I hope he realizes you for who you are and runs far away from you.", "Genuinely disgusted by this. YTA and honestly one of the biggest assholes I have seen here in a good long while. Stay in your lane and keep quiet, this situation has NOTHING to do with you.", "YTA. He will break up with you. If it looks like garbage, smells like garbage, acts like garbage, it's garbage. The amount of blind jealousy some people get with zero consideration for the real world around them is astonishing. Perhaps it's worse / a microcosm on this AITA thread, but WOWSER. Clueless much?", "Yta. She\u2019s dying. I hope Malcom and Elena have great support outside of you and they find their new normal together \n\n\nYou really should remove yourself from this situation. You obviously are in no place to offer the compassion and support they need", "You are not married to Malcolm and as such have no say about what he chooses to do or not do with regards to his sister.\n\nHer mother is in an impossible situation and made what she thought was the best choice she could.  Malcolm apparently agreed with her.  That is completely his decision.\n\nThe selfish person in this story is you.  You are only interested in how this impacts your life with him (and don't try to coat it in you looking out for Malcolm).  This changes your relationship with him.  You can choose to walk away--that is a valid choice.  But you don't get to try to pressure Malcolm into doing the same.\n\nSorry I forgot:  YTA and Malcolm sounds like an amazing young man who will probably be a fantastic father and eventually a husband.  Kudos to him for understanding the importance of family.", "To everyone who is slamming OP and saying things like she stuck her nose into where it doesn\u2019t belong think about it from this angle, Malcom made a massive life decision unilaterally with no consultation. He effectively said \u201cif you want to be with me you have to be a parent\u201d. That responsibility isn\u2019t the kind of thing you can just compartmentalise. \n\nSo this is an issue that affects her and she can have an opinion on it. How she went about dealing with it is another question. \n\nBut think about it this way, if OP got pregnant by Malcolm and unilaterally decided what to do (keep it, adopt it out doesn\u2019t matter) would you be ok with that or would you think OP should at least hear Malcom\u2019s opinion on the issue?", "YTA but more importantly is this the US?  You can\u2019t just give you kid to someone.\n\nEspecially someone who has a living parent. That isn\u2019t how any of it works. He may not even get custody even if he wants it.", "YTA WHY would you think you\u2019re opinion would matter in this situation. You\u2019ve been dating 6 months. Well I guess we\u2019re dating for 6 months cause I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t want to carry on with this seeing how you are", "YTA.. yikes like you might not want to raise a kid that's fine but if he's said yes you either do it with him or leave not make a dying woman feel like shit!", "Wow yep def big YTA I mean you are a gf of 6 months. This is fully his decision. He wants to do this. The 2 of you do not live together so this doesn\u2019t need your input at all. 6 months is not even that serious. I can\u2019t believe you even brought this up to a woman dying of cancer!", "YTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprise is Malcolm ends his relationship with you.", "YTA and FFS, time to grow up.", "This whole situation is horrible for everyone involved and you made it about you. Let's be honest, you aren't worried about where the girl is going, you're worried about how it will affect your relationship and we'll being. You should be proud of the man you are dating , of his character and how he cares about the ones close to him.", "Yta. This was his choice, not yours and he was given the option to say no. He chose to do this and as his girlfriend of six months, you really really need to back out of this or you will become the Ex girlfriend", "YTA-- You're being selfish for trying to make this decision for someone else? \n\nShe said he was allowed to say no, but of course someone she's close to is a more comfortable option for her daughter. That's not selfish, that's being a parent. \n\nHe is maybe being selfish by saying yes in your mind and you're displacing that, but that's between you and him. 6 months is not a long time, and this child was in his life before you.", "YTA.you aren\u2019t married you don\u2019t have a say in this.", "YTA\nThis sounds more about how YOU feel rather than Malcolm. If I was him you'd be a single ah.", "YTA. What a shitty thing you did making a dying mother feel even more guilt than she already feels from dying and leaving her child alone. That was not your place to ask that question even if you were thinking it.", "Without a doubt, YTFA!!!", "YTA.  Like a giant asshole.  Has nothing to do with you.  You say you\u2019ve been together for 6 months like that is a long time.  I\u2019m guessing after your stunt that time is coming to an end.  Family comes first to most people and in my opinion he will be lucky to be rid of you and find someone more like minded.", "YTA. Also, only been dating 6 months? And you think you have a say in such a big decision? Your bf sounds like a great guy.", "Ahem everyone, the girlfriend of 6 MONTHS has an opinion on the situation. Gather round to hear her assholery YTA", "Wow YTA", "YTA. Of course is not Malcom's duty to look after his sister, but it is his decision after all. If he is ok, then it is ok. And Elena is almost a teen. Selfish would be, in my opinion, if Sandra was trying to get pregnant knowing she will not be able to raise them and leave them with Malcom.", "YTA. You are heartless to say that to a dying woman and it\u2019s not your place. This is serious stuff. Malcom needs to break up with you and find someone more understanding. You are selfish and this is never going to work out now.", "YTA - You've only been in his life 6 months. They've been in his life for over a decade. Perhaps it is unfair for a 22 yo to put his life on hold to raise a sibling but there are no AHs there. She asked, he agreed and you're an AH for trying to make people feel bad for hard choices.\n\nThe relationship is probably over.", "YTA\n\n\"CONSULTING YOU\" hahahahha what a joke", "YTA obviously. It\u2019s either he takes his sister or she goes into foster care. You have only been with him 6 months and are not living together so your opinion isn\u2019t relevant. I won\u2019t be surprised if he breaks up with you after this.", "YTA\n\nAt 6 months into the relationship, you are not even a blip on the radar. You guys have barely even started dating. You have no idea if this relationship will even last. \n\nMalcolm and his sister have been close their entire lives. Their mothers are close. Is 22 younger than some people who become parents/take custody of siblings? Sure. But plenty of people have kids younger and they manage to figure it out. Plus, it is his decision. Not yours. It isn't some random distant cousin he has no relationship with who is asking him to take in four kids he has never met. This is his half-sister that he's had a lifelong relationship with. Of course he would rather be her guardian than see her go into foster care. What's wrong with you?\n\nAnd even if you disagreed with his decision and wanted to break up over it, saying something to the mother, who is dying of cancer, makes you possibly the world's biggest AH. She's not selfish. She is being brave in the face of the most terrible moment in her life. Your boyfriend is being selfless. You are being selfish and thinking only of how this might affect your carefree single future.", "You need to walk away. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s not mature enough to handle this. Shame on you. Twice!", "YTA. \nYou're not his wife. \nYou're not even his long term girlfriend. \n\nWhat makes you think that you should step in and offer your two cents of if it's selfish or not for him to take care of his little sister who's mom will die from cancer soon? The same woman he basically grew up with and probably sees as a 2nd mother? \n\nYou're selfish for getting on your high horse and adding in your 2 cents thinking you know what's best for your (likely soon to be ex) boyfriend and his sister.", "YTA and hes right, youve been together for 6 months, and its his literal sister who is currently losing her mother to cancer. Youre nothing worth compared to her, and you dont get a say. If you dont agree, leave him, he deserves better. Its also not selfish to ask him to become the guardian. You were so out of place saying what you said.", "YTA\n\nElena is his sister. It's a difficult position, but I couldn't imagine allowing a sibling to end up in foster care rather than take care of them myself. And to call a dying woman selfish is pretty callous.", "YTA.   \n\n\nThis is not your decision to make or to judge. Malcolm said yes, that is literally all that matters. The only thing you accomplished was to make a dying woman feel bad for no reason at all.  \n\n\nIf you didn't want the \"burden\" of taking care of Elena, all you had to do was break up with Malcolm. Luckily for him, he seems to have taken care of that for you.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been seeing him for a few months. That is his sister. It\u2019s not up to you to decide it is selfish of her dying mother to ask family to become a guardian.\n\nHonestly? You are not only selfish\u2026 You are asking a family you barely know to uproot a child who is going to lose her mother to move that child abroad so that you can have your boyfriend all to yourself! Selfish, entitled and arrogant all in one move!\n\nFact is? This mother has a death sentence. She is not going to be around. He\u2019s stepping up and it is absolutely nothing to do with you if he does step up. I\u2019d be proud of someone stepping up at that age, want to support them with it. The fact you don\u2019t shows so much selfishness. A 6 month relationship is not more important than his little sister who is going to lose her mother.", "You told a dying woman she's selfish for wanting to make sure her child was with family and being taken care of after her death. Really? Let that sink in and then tell me who's being selfish here. YTA.", "YTA. Malcom sounds wonderful\u2026 nobody wants to have to take on the responsibility of raising their sibling but then again nobody wants to die of cancer either. He\u2019s clearly choosing this. You\u2019re allowed to grieve the loss of the life you pictured yourself building with Malcom but you don\u2019t get to speak for him.", "Absolutely YTA. Sandra is *dying*. What part of that do you not understand? And instead of her daughter going into foster care (which isn\u2019t that great), she asked Elena\u2019s brother if he would care for her and he agreed to. It doesn\u2019t matter what his age is or what *you* think, what matters is what Malcolm decided. And he\u2019s right, you didn\u2019t need yo be consulted. I hope he breaks up with you.", "YTA\n\nSeems like you're more upset that you, his GF of 6 months, were not consulted on this decision. \n\n\n>Malcolm told me to butt out and to get on board with this or walk away.\n\nGood news he gave you your options. Now time to choose.", "Imagine not being self aware enough to know you screwed this up.  Of course YTA.  Your AH behavior has cost you the type of guy that will be a great father, partner and friend. He has empathy, and a sense of duty.

Why are masking your selfishness as some sort of crusade to protect someone who didn't even ask for or want your help?

Stalling and delaying an answer only to placate his girlfriend is out of the question, as it would only add to the anxiety this dying mother already feels. \n\nHe basically gave OP an out when \"he sat \\[OP\\] down\" - for me this indicate a very serious discussion, not something mentioned causally over dinner.", "The conversation as you are presenting it, is still happening after the decision has been made.

You expect at 6 months into a relationship, that he needs to consult you about life decisions involving his family? How do you not see that that how you feel about any of this is irrelevant.

Why would he need to consult her?\" Dating 6 months, no engagement, though - not a scenario where he needs to consult her.

You've only been together 6 months & that doesn't give you the power to do what you think you can regarding his life & desicions. You were acting selfishly & decided to be cruel because you weren't happy with his decision which isn't your choice anyway. \n\nIf you're not ready to raise a kid then don't date him. He gave you the choice to get on board or walk away.  That was him showing his kindness once again because he should have dumped you since you have shown him exactly who you truly are deep inside.

I'm sorry you're currently experiencing homelessness. You shouldn't feel guilty for needing to be taken care of by an adult when your parent dies at 17. It wasn't your fault at all, bad shit just happens to people who in no way deserve it and they just have to try and pick up the pieces and keep on living. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that at such a young age but you really have absolutely nothing to feel guilty for. Your brother took you in because he loves you. Your sister-in-law loves you. It sounds like your nieces/nephews love you. I don't know why you left, but I sincerely hope it wasn't because you felt guilty for living with them and feeling like you needed to make it on your own. I don't know your life or anything about you beyond this comment, and I know I'm just some random asshole on Reddit but I really want you to get back on your feet and with a roof over your head. I hate this hyper capitalist society and wish that working so much for garbage pay wasn't the way it worked for people who have little to nothing to start with but I hope you can land a decent job with good pay and benefits and afford to get your own place. I'm sorry for writing you a paragraph like this and making presumptions about your situation. I love you, my brother/sister and I want you to be safe and warm with someplace to live that isn't either in a tent, a car or the streets. \n\nYou should never, ever feel guilty for existing. It took me a long time to come to grips with that myself. You didn't ask to be born anymore than anyone else did, and you have exactly as much right to exist as anyone else. Your existence isn't a burden on anyone and you don't need to distance yourself from people who love you because you feel guilty about them taking care of you. Do you think your brother and sister-in-law and their kids would rather you be homeless or living with them? If you've got some other reason that you don't want to go back, like an addiction issue or there was some kind of falling out or you fled from the law or you left on a quest of vengeance that you achieved at the cost of everything else or whatever, but if you have people who love you and want to help you, don't feel guilty about accepting their help, just try to honor their generosity by doing your best to make them proud. That's all anyone can ever ask of you, just to try your best. Please, mate, give it some thought. And please hit me up if you want to talk. Your comment really broke my heart and I hate that life has been so unfair to you since you were so young. I would love to try and help you out if I can, please do DM me if you need anything."]}
