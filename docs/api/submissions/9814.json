I should mention that during that argument my boyfriend took his mom's side all the time, even when she screamed at me saying I have no rights in the apartment my boyfriend and I RENT because my name is not on the lease, and because it's his son's house she can do whatever she wants without consulting with me.   \nI took that as the signal to start buying my own place.

I offered him that I'd pay the whole mortgage, in the end, is my house, and he could help out with the utilities in the home. He was not pleased with the idea. To avoid more problems I decided I would put him on the title of the house even though the downpayment was all mine, the closing cost was all my money, and it's my credit on the house. After I put him on the title of the house he told me he will pay 23% of the mortgage plus the utilities of the house and I will take on the rest since I make more money.  I'm not comfortable with putting him on the title of the house and I don't think it's a good idea, we are not even married and I don't think I'm being financially smart here.
