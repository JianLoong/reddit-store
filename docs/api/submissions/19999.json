When he was promoted the director told him that it would be a quick promotion to the second tier. So we were expecting him to be promoted in April. \n\nWell, April passed. He has brought up his promotion several times to the director. His company is known for holding people below their deserved tier (sometimes for years) and instead spending a ton of money on new hires. He has told me probably a hundred times how much it pisses him off and how he is never going to allow that to happen to himself. \n\nI told him if August hits without a promotion he's going to have to start looking for a new job. He's a young engineer with the Masters degree and 10 years of experience, and he is never going to be more valuable as a new hire than he is right now. Frankly his sector of engineering underpays for engineers. The problem is, the job he has right now is great. The work environment is chill, he has a lot of mentors on his team that are very seasoned engineers, and he likes what his team does and wants to see it succeed. He doesn't want to start over. \n\nHe asked me \"well how much does money matter?\", and I rebutted \"well why don't *you* answer that question\", at which point he mumbled and grumbled because money has *always* mattered more to him than me and he knows it. \n\nI feel like I'm just trying to prevent him from doing something he regrets in being complacent.

Being comfortable and growing (not all growth is career and money growth) for 1/3 of your life and getting money for this sounds great for me.", "YTA, and it\u2019s not accurate that he\u2019s never going to be more valuable than he is now. More experience and track record for designing, executing, shipping product or whatever it is that he does- is valuable. You have no idea what\u2019s happening inside the company and he is in a better position to determine how long it makes sense to wait it out. He needs to talk to his manager and exec team and should be actively having the discussion about his goals and realistic timelines. Mid-cycle promotions are usually rare and much harder to get, requiring some type of exceptional situation. I\u2019m guessing they meant Nov as a quick next tier promotion.  \n\nHe\u2019s not being complacent.

If he's unhappy or uncomfortable where he is, he'll make a move.

I\u2019ve been in work environments I hated, every day going to work was stressful, when you have a good work environment you can actually look forward to going to work. I wouldn\u2019t give that up easily, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being content with your current situation", "Leave the decision to him. Only he knows what will make him happy,in that situation. Tell him that you will be supportive, no matter what. In this way, you don't get blamed for whatever he decides to do.\nYou can ask him different questions to help him make a decision, but let him make the decision for himself.", "INFO: how does your husband have ten years of professional experience as an engineer with a masters when he\u2019s only 30?", "YTA because as a partner, you should support him and advise him accordingly, instead of making the decision for him.", "NAH - It\u2019s good you encouraged him to find better.

If he was in a low paying job and didn\u2019t contribute enough to pull his own weight financially, then I would understand. \n\nI think it\u2019s fine to suggest, encourage, and support him but wording makes a big difference here. If I had a conversation like this with my partner and she said it the way you did I\u2019d laugh in her face.\n\nIt may be complacency, which isn\u2019t always a bad thing. If he\u2019s happy in his role, that\u2019s a blessing, very few people can say that. I\u2019ve been in more terrible roles than I have been in ones that made me happy.\n\nAlso, I do think it was in poor taste to respond to him asking how much money mattered the way you did. You initiated a demand and he obviously values his work environment more than money because he asked the question in response (so the question is already answered). Money used to be important to me but that perception has changed, which it\u2019s possible his perception has changed too. It just seemed like a rude response in order to try and \u201cwin\u201d.\n\nAnd like others have stated here, you don\u2019t get to dictate his decisions because you believe you know better than he does about what\u2019s best for him.

I cried with relief when my husband landed his current job at an amazing people first company - the change in him was insane.\n\nTrust me, money doesn't matter truly when the job is the right one - encourage him to pursue development in his current place but don't be laying down the law like that.", "YTA\n\nYou should not tell him to get a new job, you suggest that if he's unhappy he should look for new a job, but frankly sounds like he is happy and has a great job, management just sucks. Also that bit about money great way to use someone's motivations to manipulate them into making a decision.", "YTA. He's not a child and you can't dictate to him what he does with his employment choices. He's clearly factoring other things in besides the money. Shut up about it.", "yta.  I choose to work a job that pays less for my degree and experience than other companies.  It\u2019s low stress and provides a good work life balance.  It\u2019s not your place to dictate to your husband that he get new job.  It\u2019s worth it imo to work a job you like for less money, rather than making more and being miserable.", "YTA.  Would you do what he said if he started dictating what career choices he thinks are right for you?  It is his career\u2026.his work life.  Salary isn\u2019t absolutely everything.
