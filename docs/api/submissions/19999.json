When he was promoted the director told him that it would be a quick promotion to the second tier. So we were expecting him to be promoted in April. \n\nWell, April passed. He has brought up his promotion several times to the director. His company is known for holding people below their deserved tier (sometimes for years) and instead spending a ton of money on new hires. He has told me probably a hundred times how much it pisses him off and how he is never going to allow that to happen to himself.  It's also pretty well known in his industry that you have to move around to get paid.\n\nI told him if August hits without a promotion he's going to have to start looking for a new job. He's a young engineer with the Masters degree and 10 years of experience, and he is never going to be more valuable as a new hire than he is right now. Frankly his sector of engineering underpays for engineers. The problem is, the job he has right now is great. The work environment is chill, he has a lot of mentors on his team that are very seasoned engineers, and he likes what his team does and wants to see it succeed. He doesn't want to start over. \n\nHe asked me \"well how much does money matter?\", and I rebutted \"well why don't *you* answer that question?\", at which point he mumbled and grumbled (and giggled) because money has *always* mattered more to him than me and he knows it. \n\nI feel like I'm just trying to prevent him from doing something he regrets in being complacent.

More experience and track record for designing, executing, shipping product or whatever it is that he does- is valuable. You have no idea what\u2019s happening inside the company and he is in a better position to determine how long it makes sense to wait it out. He needs to talk to his manager and exec team and should be actively having the discussion about his goals and realistic timelines.

You initiated a demand and he obviously values his work environment more than money because he asked the question in response (so the question is already answered). Money used to be important to me but that perception has changed, which it\u2019s possible his perception has changed too.

His point are valid. There is no one right answer.\n\nSwitching jobs is a pain in the butt and companies definitely use that fact to get away with underpaying workers. I'm a young engineer who switched jobs last year and I both am glad I did and regret it. My old job was much more connected, with mentors, coworkers and an overall environment I thrived in. I was much more invested in it and I really miss it a lot of the time. In contrast, my new job is very individual and not the type of work I enjoy most. That said, the pay is MUCH better, and allowed me to buy a house, get a needed medical procedure and generally have a lot more wiggle room in my finances. My life at work is worse, but not unlivable, and life outside work is better.

Then think do you earn enough to live and if you do stay.\n\n There is no point earning more and being miserable and stressed. If he regrets not moving, that's on him. If you push him to move and he regrets it, it could cause him to have resentment towards you.  Let him decide", "You can't have it both ways, if you're comfortable then stop complaining about not getting the promotion. If you're annoyed you didn't get the promotion, then look for another company that will value you more.\n\nNTA, I would push my partner to change job's if they were constantly complaining about their current one.", "If he doesn't want to move, why don't he try to leverage another offer instead?", "YTAH. You gave your husband an ultimatum about his own life and job? Wow money over his happiness\u2026", "NAH. You worded it poorly, he doesn't \"have to\" do anything come August, but it was not bad to bring up the idea of alternative jobs. The higher promotion is clearly a carrot on a string at this point. People have a hard time leaving when something good's dangled in front of them--be it due to optimism, sunk cost fallacy, inertia, whatever. There's a reason some employees have stayed at that company waiting on phantom promotions for years.\n\nIf he was really frustrated with his work situation and just hadn't gotten up the motivation to leave yet, your encouragement could have been valuable. However, now that he's made it clear he prefers to stay at that job even if the promotion isn't materializing, it's time to just support him in his decision. If you were to keep pushing you would become the AH.", "He's afraid, went through this same thing with my husband 20 yrs later, and he left. He had the same excuses. Staying will tear down his self-esteem, not worth it", "No. You just worded it wrong. I, too, dislike complaining. A sure way to make sure he isn\u2019t used and underpaid it to look for a job that will pay him his worth. Him complaining to you about it 24/7 and continuing to work there is an issue. There\u2019s something he can do about it. He surely isn\u2019t stuck there with all that experience. Either suck it up and be quiet, or look for another job. I\u2019m sure you love him, but no one wants to hear complaining all the time, and seeing no action taken.", "NAH\n\nIf he is really happy where he is at, then he would not be bringing the money issue up. So you pushing him, to a point, is normal and a good thing. Leaving a job can be a hard thing to do, and can make you stay at a company long past when you should. Some outside encourgment is sometimes needed to take that leap. \n\nAnd as you said, and his response confirmed, he does care about the money. You gave him a little push, helped him set a deadline, and that is all you can really do. You are not berrating him, but pushing him to make the choice. That is kinda what spouses are for.", "NTA he seems to agree with you on some aspects and you aren\u2019t insisting he quit, just shop around. Let him get offers and use them as leverage.

You don't have kids and spend most of your time \"working on your hobbies\". You live in a tiny house where cleaning doesn't take much effort by your own admission. So you've basically retired at 30. Your tax write off excuse is so stupid. By that logic most dual income couples wouldn't exist and no one would try to make money above a certain ceiling. If you want more money, go make it yourself. Don't dress it up as concern for your husband's career and tell the poor guy he has to quit a job he doesn't want to quit. If you wanna be a stay at home mom, revisit that discussion after you're actually a mom.", "YTA. He likes what he does and where he is.

Jeez.", "Ah but the lack of continuous promotions interferes with her SAHM plans.", "So does OP.

OP then decided intead of being supportive she would throw it on his face that he cares more about money rather than answer a simple question someone us asking to make a decision.", "So he's been complaining for 3 months out of a 10 year career and its too much? Seems like OP can't handle any amount of support.", "NAH-- at least, not yet. It's fine to have the conversation and make suggestions. But ultimately, it's his choice in terms of what he wants to do with his career. So you shouldn't keep harping on him about it. Just let him know you're available to talk if he wants to re-evaluate a few months down the line. \n\nIf he chooses to stay because he likes the work environment more than he cares about the promotion, then I think it's also fair to ask him not to complain constantly to you about it.", "The reality is that a lot of engineering companies, software companies, and similar other companies, are still stuck in a \"traditional\" mindset where people earn *maybe* 3% per year as a cost-of-living increase but otherwise don't see big bumps in pay outside of being promoted to a higher position. New hire budgets are often larger than retention budgets (where most \"retention\" is used for large bonuses for upper-level managers and executives, comparatively little for everybody else). \n\nIt is a sad fact that, for most STEM-related positions, the way to make more money is to job hop. Your company is going to offer you maybe 1%-3% year-over-year to stay, while the next company might offer you 10%-20% to leave. General guidance in this area is to not jump more often than every 2 years, but not to stay anywhere for more than 3-5 years at most. If you jump more often companies will see you as unreliable and not worth training, while if you jump less often you're leaving money on the table.\n\nYour husband's current company isn't going to pay him what he's worth on the open market. They don't have the retention budget for that. However, they did give him something quite valuable: the \"manager\" job title. Tell your husband to update his resume and send out one or two just to \"feel out the market\". Maybe he doesn't find anything he likes. **BUT** he might start to see offers and when the numbers start coming in it will be hard for him to stay where he is.", "NAH\n\nHe can look for a job. If he gets one he can use it as leverage on his current job for a raise and/or promotion.  Work environment is a *huge* factor. I've taken a lower paying offer (that actually grew quickly due to my performance) over a much higher paying job that would have been a terrible, burn-out, off-shift work environment...and I've never regretted it.\n\nDo you have a job that can support the household if necessary? This is the biggest power ability from a decent skilled dual-income household. You and your husband can \"take turns\" every few years working towards a promotion in your current company, or a higher position in a new company. You can threaten to walk if things don't go well...and actually do it if necessary! Your background should land you somewhere soon enough.  You may take a \u00bd step back now and then...but if you are worth your weight at what you do in general you should advance quickly.", "A lot of people are afraid of moving out of their comfort zones even though it is to their benefit or they are not really happy with their circumstances, they are just afraid it will suck more afterwards even though it's not very likely.\n\nThe fact that he had complained about this type of situation and even said he would not take it but now does does imply that he might not be as comfortable with it as he now pretends, he is just scared to go against the flow.\n\nThough OP worded it poorly I think it's good that she is giving him a little push. Ultimately he should decide for himself and she should not insist against his wishes but I do think this could have been something he needed to hear.", "They are both ah behaviour to me. He can\u2019t be constantly going on about money and be willing to do literally nothing about it.
