When he was promoted the director told him that it would be a quick promotion to the second tier. So we were expecting him to be promoted in April. \n\nWell, April passed. He has brought up his promotion several times to the director. His company is known for holding people below their deserved tier (sometimes for years) and instead spending a ton of money on new hires. He has told me probably a hundred times how much it pisses him off and how he is never going to allow that to happen to himself.  It's also pretty well known in his industry that you have to move around to get paid.\n\nI told him if August hits without a promotion he's going to have to start looking for a new job. He's a young engineer with the Masters degree and 10 years of experience, and he is never going to be more valuable as a new hire than he is right now. Frankly his sector of engineering underpays for engineers. The problem is, the job he has right now is great. The work environment is chill, he has a lot of mentors on his team that are very seasoned engineers, and he likes what his team does and wants to see it succeed. He doesn't want to start over. \n\nHe asked me \"well how much does money matter?\", and I rebutted \"well why don't *you* answer that question?\", at which point he mumbled and grumbled (and giggled) because money has *always* mattered more to him than me and he knows it. \n\nI feel like I'm just trying to prevent him from doing something he regrets in being complacent.

More experience and track record for designing, executing, shipping product or whatever it is that he does- is valuable. You have no idea what\u2019s happening inside the company and he is in a better position to determine how long it makes sense to wait it out. He needs to talk to his manager and exec team and should be actively having the discussion about his goals and realistic timelines.

I\u2019ve been in work environments I hated, every day going to work was stressful, when you have a good work environment you can actually look forward to going to work.

You initiated a demand and he obviously values his work environment more than money because he asked the question in response (so the question is already answered). Money used to be important to me but that perception has changed, which it\u2019s possible his perception has changed too.

His point are valid. There is no one right answer.\n\nSwitching jobs is a pain in the butt and companies definitely use that fact to get away with underpaying workers. I'm a young engineer who switched jobs last year and I both am glad I did and regret it. My old job was much more connected, with mentors, coworkers and an overall environment I thrived in. I was much more invested in it and I really miss it a lot of the time. In contrast, my new job is very individual and not the type of work I enjoy most. That said, the pay is MUCH better, and allowed me to buy a house, get a needed medical procedure and generally have a lot more wiggle room in my finances. My life at work is worse, but not unlivable, and life outside work is better.

It is absolutely the main thing, but if he can be getting other things out of his work (such as excellent mentorship, networking, great colleagues) it might do just as well to sit tight a while.

With a masters degree in engineering he needs to move along and get a promotion or go somewhere else.  He\u2019s wasting time just waiting around.", "NAH. As I read it, this is a discussion within a marriage rather than an ultimatum.

Yeah it\u2019s tough to know he could make 100k more but that will likely come with a work life balance aspect to it. Paired with the fact you work part time (which I understand you have an argument for) I think you\u2019ve got to leave this decision up to him. Otherwise it would be equally fair for him to push you to find a higher paying job because you could get one.

At this point he needs to arrange a 1-1 meeting with his boss to find out where he stands. I'm not sure how he is asking at the moment but that's the best way face to face and no chance of running away. Then he makes a decision based on that. He clearly would prefer to stay there if the pay went up. If its refused then he has the choice to look elsewhere or stay. If he stays then he can't complain about the salary anymore.  \nIts also daunting job hunting and some people choose to just be unhappy in what they know then risk something possibly worse. That's where he probably needs a push and more encouragement. \nBut ultimately he can't let it drag on he needs to find out now if his boss will promote him or not.

When I vent about those aspects I\u2019m looking for validation and perspective. I think the best approach for op would be to say \u201cI can totally understand why you\u2019re frustrated.
