My birthday is this week and my brother offered to get me a puppy for my birthday last month, so I decided to take the leap when he offered and will have the puppy in a few days. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend, who I\u2019ve been off/on with for a few years, has started staying with me more. We are in our 30s. He has bipolar disorder and depression that he was recently diagnosed with and moved home with his parents (at their suggestion) to get back on his feet, but I\u2019ve observed they\u2019re emotionally abusive and being there is even worse on his mental health. \n\nWe had separated for a while earlier this spring because he needed space to figure out his mental health after his diagnosis, so I hadn\u2019t told him about the puppy or really considered his opinion, since I wasn\u2019t sure what our future would even be at that point after being off/on for years and honestly this was a decision for myself. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have reconnected lately and he recently brought some more of his things over (after asking me) because he was driving back and forth a lot to get things from his parents\u2019 house. I still pay the bills. We haven\u2019t discussed him being here as a permanent thing and I don\u2019t want to push it while he\u2019s still figuring out his recent diagnosis and mental health, but said yes to him staying here for now because it\u2019s hard to watch the situation with his family. \n\nI\u2019m nervous to tell him about the dog plan because I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019ll feel. He says he doesn\u2019t want pets and also claimed not to like birds, but treats my parakeet like a king. Researched parakeets to make sure we were doing all the best things for him, plays with him daily, sings him songs, has a whole bedtime routine for him. They\u2019re best friends now and it\u2019s adorable. He\u2019s said having the bird to take care of makes him so much happier. I don\u2019t expect him to take care of the dog, but I\u2019m 99.9% sure having the dog around will have a similar affect on his mental health. \n\nWIBTA for proceeding with my plan to get the puppy without getting his input now that he\u2019s been staying with me more?\n\nEDIT/MORE INFO TO CLARIFY: thank you all for your thoughts so far. After reading some replies, I wanted to add that a better way to phrase my question is probably WIBTA for getting a puppy without ASKING my boyfriend about the puppy, not without TELLING him about the puppy. I definitely don\u2019t want to just show up at home with a puppy one day and recognize that I want to tell him. I made this post to get outside perspective to decide on the best way for me to do that, because I\u2019m not sure at this point if I\u2019m correct in thinking it\u2019s my decision independently or if I should weigh his opinion on it more given our current circumstances.", "created_utc": 1685890731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140fkwl/wibta_for_getting_a_puppy_without_telling_my/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Therefore you should at least bring the idea of getting a dog up with him and get an idea of his reaction. By not telling him, I think you are setting yourself up for failure.

There have never been any glaring issues between the two of us, but the reality is that his mental health issues have made him an unstable partner.

He did ask me if I was okay with him sleeping over more lately because of the bad situation he has at home right now because he said he\u2019s felt like he invited himself to be here all the time without my permission. I told him I was fine with that, as I knew he felt better here than at home, so he asked if he could bring over some necessities (clothes, toiletries, and a small desk to use in my spare room for his computer to find a new job) so he wasn\u2019t going back and forth to his house so much, which is 30 min away, and I told him that was fine with me, but we haven\u2019t discussed it being anything more permanent than that because I recognize he\u2019s not really in a place right now to make that type of commitment to anyone while trying to get his income and mental health situation sorted out. I\u2019m fine with doing what I can to support him at the moment, because like I said, he really is my best friend, but I\u2019m not really as comfortable with building my larger life decisions around him just yet until he\u2019s able to get to a more stable place consistently for us to discuss a bigger future.", "It's your home, you don't need his permission and you don't need to explain yourself.\n\nDogs are great for getting you out of the house when you work from home.\n\nYou get exercise.\n\nYou get something that loves you more than you love them. \n\n\nIf your on/off bf is off about this, you got your dog to cheer you up.\n\nNothing wrong with this scenario", "NTA but - you might want to rethink the relationship, unless being a sugar mama is your plan.", "Well I know that anxiety can be hard to manage I\u2019ve experienced it myself.

It\u2019s too hard to know what things will look like for my boyfriend long term after what the past year has looked like, and I don\u2019t want to write off the relationship and am fine giving him space for that because I don\u2019t fault him for having mental health things going on, but I\u2019m just not totally comfortable putting off decisions about my own life right now per all of the uncertainty.

I don\u2019t expect him to do any of the work to care for the dog. I work from home, so am able to be here to handle all of the responsibilities independently. I am planning to talk with him, but I made the decision without him during a period when we weren\u2019t together and am wondering if I now need to consider his opinion at this point in my decision vs letting him know this is what\u2019s happening.", "And I'm telling you that yes you need to consider his opinion if he is literally living with you. \n\n> said yes to him staying here for now\n\nAka: his opinion will matter but at the very least you're an asshole for not telling him about it or having a conversation with him.", "NTA - But would it hurt if you told him you were considering getting a puppy and asked for his input. You can ignore it, but you'll avoid the discussion when/if he comes over and sees a puppy.", "Ywnbta\n\nThis is Your home. You should not have to be tiptoeing around telling your off/on again bf about a decision you've made for yourself and your home\n\nIf he was highly allergic, ok maybe give him a heads up. But a heads up is all he needs. You Do Not need his permission.\n\nHave fun with your pupper.", "Clearly, as you've pointed out, you need to tell him. I don't think you would be the asshole for not asking him - it's your house and your decision. But I would advise on letting him know as soon as possible, so he has time to process the news. \n\nClearly your boyfriend likes to be informed, and he might have a shock period before he goes into research mode. It'd be nice for him to have the time to do that and would ease the process for everyone, IMHO. So don't delay, and best wishes with the new family member!", "Your house, your rules. You don't have to ask anyone permission to bring a dog home. He doesn't live there. And even if is there often, he doesn't pay the bills.\n\nAlso, the whole on again/off again reads like a lot of red flags to me.", "NTA - Your house, your rules. I would definitely tell him that you\u2019re getting a puppy, but he doesn\u2019t really get a say in whether you get it or not.", "Get the dog and put bf on pause. He needs to focus on his mental health right now. NTA", "Good news!\n\nHe won't have that responsibility as you are fully willing and capable of doing it yourself.\n\nIf he does have issue just emphasis this your pet and he can be the \"Disney Dad\" or Fun Uncle if he wants. \ud83e\udd23", "Very understandable, but I also don't think you should feel like you can't tell him what decision you're making for your home, you should feel you're able to go to him and say you are wanting to get a puppy. And the thing is, for me, you're on and off with this guy and I think if you don't get the puppy you've always wanted you're going to resent him when you're together, and if you're off again you'll regret not getting the puppy.", "Good luck I hope it goes well for you both!", "As an aside, ummm... how thoroughly did you research parakeets...? Because they're social animals and you really shouldn't keep one alone. A pair at minimum.", "YWBTA for not even mentioning it. You have absolutely every right to get yourself a puppy/pet of any sort for you, but a partner you kind of live with has every right to know that they may have some new responsibilities that they didn't sign up for in the near future. This isn't \"I'm thinking blue instead of green for this wall\" requiring no upkeep, this is \"I want to take care of a living being\" that goes way beyond food and water.", "NTA... You dont need his permission to get a puppy obviously but I hope you know that this will take at least 100 dollars / month and minimum 2 hours per day to properly care for your dog. You will need a vet, a vacuum, and all weather cloths to exercise them year round. Everytime you want to vacation you are looking at house sitter, even for a day.  You will need behavior training, lots of cleaning and you will probably lose many items the first few years to their active chewing. If you are serious about your boyfriend you will consider his input.", "Get the dog, dump the boy. Stop doing the \"on again off again\" thing. He doesn't live with you, he doesn't pay your bills, her doesn't get a vote. NTA.", "You need to be single for a while and be done with the yoyo bullshit.", "YTA especially if you buy the dog from a breeder or pet store.", "YWBTA\nBut a soft ah, you need to inform him \"you're welcome to stay here, however you should know that I have a puppy now\" because he should know what the terms are and have an option to not take it. \n\nI think its fabulous you're helping him out of a tough spot. I think it's fabulous you're willing to help so much. I see a huge red flag though. You are concerned about his reaction.  This is your home, you pay for all of it.  You are fully entitled to have whatever pet you desire (as long as your lease/insurance allows it) simple as that. But someone moving in needs a full disclosure of what to expect and your boundaries.  \n\nYou should also consider a written contract with him of expectations of contributions,  time line of allowing him to live with you,  and your expectations of boundaries.  He's not on the lease.. however,  after a certain amount of time if you want him to leave, you'll have to start an eviction process which could go badly. He could trash your home,  destroy your things etc and because it's his address,  you're stuck with him.. also if you're renting, be sure it's allowed. It's not so simple letting people live with you even under the best circumstances.  But if his mental health is an issue, it could turn terrible for you if not handled well. \n\nThink things through, make sure you're safe in your own home. Protect yourself, then see where you can help. It's a sad thing when this is the outcome, but I've been very badly \"burned\" by helping people I thought I could trust.", "Dogs are the best.\n\nIt might be an idea to move any shoes to somewhere high up.", "NTA. it\u2019s you home and he doesn\u2019t live there.  You don\u2019t need to ask him but you can tell him that you will be getting one.  You don\u2019t have to tell him at all.", "This is a whole other story lol but I originally had 2, as I know this about them. One of them passed away not long ago and we\u2019ve been trying to decide the best way to introduce a new companion bird to him safely.", "Yes, I do understand this, thank you. My brother is able to watch him if I ever go out of town, I already do a ton of cleaning regardless lol, I\u2019ve looked into pet health insurance that I\u2019d intend to enroll him in for any major needs that could arise, and paying for his overall care and supplies is no issue, as I have a good job and no dependents or major debts to pay off. I also work from home, so am able to dedicate the needed time to him on my own.", "It\u2019s not your job to rescue this bf. He\u2019s a project at this point. TELL him you\u2019re getting it. Bf isn\u2019t your partner. Partners pay their way. \n\nYou\u2019ve wanted the puppy before the bf. You\u2019ll the dog have when bf is gone.\n\nNTA", "Puppies and birds also aren't a particularly clever mix of pets, especially in small living spaces. One bad interaction and the poor bird is gone. The existing pet deserves more consideration before introducing a predator into its safe space.", "In that case, you are ready. Enjoy. I'd love another puppy, but my 6yr old yellow lab has finally calmed down and gotten easy.", "Well I live in a large two-bedroom townhome that has three floors, so there\u2019s plenty of space for them to not interact. I\u2019ve previously kept a bird and a dog as pets at the same time and was able to manage with no issues by taking needed precautions."]}
