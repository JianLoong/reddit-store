I am a sous chef and I'm very proud of my work, as I work in one of the most prestigious restaurants in the city. \nWe had 11 people and I asked about dietary requirements and what people wants to eat. Everyone was fine with a risotto and didn't want anything else. They all said they want to try mine as the restaurant I work at often gets praised and we are known for our authentic Italian food.\n\nWhen the guests showed up, one of my wife's uncle brought a frozen pizza over. Stating \"I don't eat risotto, I don't do carbs\". He had over 2 days to inform me about his dietary requirements and I could also whip something out very last minute if needed. \nAt the end of the night, my wife asked what was wrong and I told her I thought it was very rude of her uncle, to show up with his own frozen pizza and told me he don't do rice because he doesn't touch carbs (because apparently there's no carbs in frozen pizzas). And he didn't bother trying it and much rather have his frozen pizza.\n\nShe said I was over reacting and shouldn't be mad or offended. I spent time and effort on making a very nice risotto for everyone (with the starters, wine, mains and dessert that I prepared, the cost would be around \u00a370 each if they ate at my restaurant) and if he wanted something else, I would've been more than happy to make a pizza from scratch for him. It's not difficult.\n\nSo AITA for being offended and think it's rude that he brought his own food to a dinner party and gave me a random BS excuse? Because it's the same principle for restaurants, if you bring your own food to a restaurant, they would ask you to leave.\n\nEdit: my mom, step dad and cousin in law all think it was very rude for what he did and quite disrespectful to the host of the party. I also wanted to tell him to go back home with his frozen pizza, but didn't.\n\nEdit 2: seems like lots of people are getting lost midway through. \n1. The reason I'm offended and mad, is because he gave me a bs excuse.\n2. I asked everyone if there were dietary requirements. There were and worked around their needs. \n3. He told me he wanted to try my risotto and had no allergies nor food related issues.\n4. He is not a fussy eater.\n\nEdit 3: even though I was mad, I didn't say anything to him. Cooked his damn frozen pizza (and no, I was nice enough to not burn it) I enjoyed the dinner party with all the other guests. Even the uncle's daughter and wife told him it's rude to bring a pizza to someone's dinner party as a guest and he shouldn't.", "created_utc": 1696456644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zzynd/aita_for_thinking_my_wifes_uncle_was_rude_to/", "score": 788, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's rude for a person to bring their own food to a dinner party without warning the host and giving the host an opportunity to accommodate them.  So you are ultimately NTA.\n\nBut you're focusing really, really hard on how amazing your food is and how offended you are that he wouldn't try your risotto.  This would have been a rude gesture if you *weren't* a sous chef and it *weren't* authentic risotto.  If someone brings a casserole to your party where you are serving casserole, that's a power move and you are entirely in your rights to be irritated.  But you're getting ridiculous in comparing your house to a restaurant.  You're not a restaurant and the principle is not the same.  You need to get over yourself a little and realize that his rudeness to you wouldn't have been any less if you were an amateur cook who just enjoys throwing dinner parties.", "My buddy\u2019s wife invited me and my wife over for a double date dinner. I found the food terrible from taste to texture. I ate the whole thing and complimented and thanked her for the food.

Does he really think pizza doesn\u2019t have carbs? \ud83d\ude02 I wish that was true! You specifically asked them all about dietary requirements. He should have spoken up. I think it\u2019s more than common courtesy to not bring a pizza when someone else has made dinner at their home for you - and I have autism!", "NTA, it was rude and a bull excuse. He should have just stayed home. Next time if he doesn\u2019t want to eat your cooking he can stay home or at least talk to you about the problem to see if you can work something out. He might be one of those people who don\u2019t like eating other peoples food. If he\u2019s got some issue like that they should tell you up front.", "I\u2019d never think of turning up at someone else\u2019s dinner party with my own food! Sure, dietary restrictions & food preferences exist but uncle is a GROWN man who can use his words to at least inform OP beforehand.

Man there are some really delusional responses on there saying y t a. This is a grown man we're talking about that could have told OP at anytime what he wanted to eat and instead bought a frozen pizza to a dinner party and made OP cook it for him like he's a danged toodler.

I would never dream of getting my one food unless its like some very specific thing that cannot reasonably be accomodated. Not this Homer Simpson BS.

Because it's the same principle for restaurants, if you bring your own food to a restaurant, they would ask you to leave.\n\nBut it's not your restaurant, it's your home. The point is to make your guests feel comfortable. \n\nLook, I don't know if the uncle doesn't do carbs or not. Maybe he is an embarrassingly picky eater. Maybe certain unexpected foods give him violent flatulence, and this particular pizza is 'safe.' Maybe he didn't want to inconvenience you or draw attention to himself. Maybe he's just a curmudgeon. The reality is, it seems highly unlikely he brought the pizza to spite you... it's not about you at all.  \n\nNo doubt your risotto was good and I'm sure you got approbation from other guests. But yeah, I do think you're a little over-the-top to be so offended. That you had to tell AITA that you work at \"one of the most prestigious restaurants in the city,\" that you were offended a guest didn't try your praiseworthy food, that you had to remark on the estimated cost of what you provide, and that fact that you took this so personally versus just accept that your guest had a clear reason for bringing something that he could eat at no additional headache/expense to you makes this more a \"you\" issue.   \n   \nI'm normally a stickler for manners, but this I think is a mild YTA.", "YTA\n\n>I am a sous chef\n\nThat's the problem - you're taking the uncle's choice of food as a comment on your professional culinary abilities. The uncle probably just has specific dietary needs and doesn't feel like explaining a bunch of backstory to a relative. That's his right.

Absolutely unacceptable for a grown man. Rude.", "It is exceptionally rude to do what he did and there was no need to.

It would be one thing if it had been a potluck dinner of some sort, but you had made it perfectly clear that you were making everything, AND had checked into dietary requirements.", "NTA. You can think he's rude and just leave it at that. You're taking great offense to this. Step back and think about this: you're pissed over a frozen pizza. Come on now!.\n\nHe didn't want to trouble you when you were having a bunch of people over. I personally think that's thoughtful. The carbs thing is BS. He just didn't want risotto. He also didn't want to have to ask you to accommodate. I think it's nice because then he got what he wanted, enjoyed everyone's company and everyone else can love your risotto, what's the problem here?\n\nI'm no professional chef and I will say when I'm making a huge meal for people, making one separate thing is an extra headache I'd rather not have.

You don't know what is going on mentally, physically, or health-wise with someone. It might have been very difficult for them to participate in the dinner party or ask for special food.  Cut them some slack and just let it go.  If you are that put out by their actions, don't invite them again.", "YTA. People sometimes have weird food preferences, and the don't always want to have their palate interrogated. Just let it go, dude. The guy just wanted his frozen pizza. This isn't a knock on you so sit your ego down.", "YTA\n\n> Because it's the same principle for restaurants, if you bring your own food to a restaurant, they would ask you to leave.\n\nThis right here makes you the AH in the story. It is not a restaurant.\n\nThe uncle escaped since I don't know how close you are with him. It takes a decent level of comfort with a host to say 'Yeah I don't like what you're serving. Can you make me something different?' Especially since you seem to be very concerned that everyone knows how good your cooking is.", "NTA. \n\nThat was an AH move, of course. Your best reaction would have been if you did not react at all. Because he obviously did it to get a reaction of you.\n\nIf he ever invites you to his place for whatever, don't bring anything except your own food. If asked, tell him you can't trust his food if he believes frozen pizza does not contain carbs. Make sure to use your best snobby Chef slang - like, \"oh, is that even food?\" If he can take a joke, this might becoming a running joke between the two of you. If he can't... ok, he'll just not be invited anymore. If your wife - who, I guess, was enjoying your cooking until now - has a problem with that, she can meet him at his fast food place of choice for more frozen pizzas. \n\nBut I'm curious about the food you made: What kind of risotto?

Your wife was right; you were over reacting. It was not intended as, and was not actually, an insult to you.\n\nYour restaurant analogy sucks.

As you said, you were  perfectly fine with diet restrictions and happy to make him something else", "I\u2019ll go light YTA but you need to stop framing it as an offence against your food.

No. You are entitled to feel how you feel, which is why there are NAH here.\n\nBut go back to the original reason for hosting a dinner party. Is this gathering meant to boost your ego by showing off your cooking or for family to gather and have a good time?\n\nIf the purpose of the dinner party for everyone to only enjoy your cooking, you should cull that guest list with that in mind. Your wife's uncle is probably feeling like he needed to be there socially, so he decided to solve what he perceived to be a personal problem. He is not required to eat your food.\n\nThe only thing he seemed to have unintentionally hurt here, is your ego as a sous chef of a reputable restaurant. But this isn't a restaurant, it's your home. This isn't a gourmet gathering. It's a family dinner.

I would!", "When did pizza lose its carbs lmao", "YTA, as someone who has dietary restrictions, I will never ask someone hosting to make me something special.
