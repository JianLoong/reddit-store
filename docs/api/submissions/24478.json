Once she wet one soft surface she'd move to another and so on until everything was wet and cold and we both had nowhere to sleep and every day I was washing and cleaning. For about three weeks, hour after hour I'd drag myself up out of bed while my eyes were so heavy they'd barely open and I felt annoyed and desperate and useless. I was so sleep interrupted that I'd get angry and snap at her and then just cry, cuddling her and aplogising.
