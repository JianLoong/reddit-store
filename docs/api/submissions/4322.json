If anything, she is being inconsiderate of your time. People who are chronically late and make other people be late with them are seriously annoying, and if telling her that you need to be somewhere half an hour earlier than you have to is the only way to get her to be ready on time, so be it.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfair of her to constantly make you late when you obviously value being punctual. I hate when people can't manage their time and are always late; I have an ex like this and it drove me absolutely crazy. There were times when I told him we had to be somewhere earlier than we did because I knew he'd make us late.\n\nI also just left without him a few times, so that's another option.", "NTA I would do the same. It hurts no-one and actually helps", "NTA \n\nHowever, I'd prefer for you to sit down and have a talk about her disrespect of your time and the time of others. Find a way to reach a compromise that involves you helping her start to get ready sooner. That could be reminding her to start or building more time into the schedule when you have control over when things start. Any time caring enough for each other to negotiate what you need and compromise can be achieved rather than lying, it's a good idea.", "NTA. I have friends who I tell need to be places and hour before they do because then they will arrive on time. Everyone wins.", "NTA, You're just looking for a reasonable way to arrive on time, which is not an A-hole move.", "WNBTA\n\nMy husband does this all the time. It\u2019s never bothered me when I found out", "NTA! She won't be harmed by this", "NTA.\n\nIt is a lie, but its a lie that harms no one.  \n\nThere are a few options, none of which are good.  You can wait around for her, and you both show up late, which is rude.  You can lie to her about the time and get there when you should (lying).  Or you can leave without her, which will probably piss her off. \n\nYour solutions is probably the best one.  But it won't always work, because eventually she will catch on and start adjusting accordingly.", "I do this with my gf because she likes to push it and we normally still end up almost being late places", "NTA. We had to do this with my mom.", "NTA, I'm time blind and telling me earlier time to be somwhere is very helpful for me. Yes on rare occasions I arrive at time and I have to wait for others, but it is still better than have everyone wait for me. Unfortunately it don't work if I'm the one who is putting time in tha calendar because I'd remember it and I will come even later \ud83d\ude22", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Over 40 years later and nothing has changed.", "Meh.  NTA.\n\nI do this for my friend who is always late. I will say, though, that my husband -- who is never on time -- did it to me for a while to make sure the kids were ready when he wanted to leave and that really, really annoyed me. So approach something like this with some caution.", "Honestly it really depends on how shes likely to react if she finds out. Like is she bothered by being late or by you being bothered by it?? i dont think youd be the ass for doing it but how shed feel about it when finding out is what matters-if its gonna be a problem you might just be exchanging one headache for another. \n\ni personally would love it if somebody else were able to do this for me cos time....doesnt really work for me like it does everybody else lol but some people are weird about shit so. \n\nBased on your post it doesnt seem like shes doing it intentionally but you feel the way you do and shes not done anything to accommodate that so maybe she just doesnt care or something. But like have yall talked about this at all?? Cos thats the other important thing. If youve expressed your concerns and shes just continued on the same then i say go for it, just remember the headache thing.", "Nta, how would she figure it out if you guys are arriving on time ?", "NTA. This is something we very commonly do in Hispanic families because unfortunately that is one stereotype that often holds true in my experience and we tend to run late. It hurts no one to do this.", "NTA and this is common. It feels bad to lie to people, but ultimately it's better to tell a white lie so you arrive on time than to micro-manage her getting ready because you're anxious about being late. I would say when I have discussed this with late friends, they have found it amusing and not offensive because they *know* how long they take to get ready.", "NTA - the number of people I know that do this to/for their partners is hilarious. It\u2019s common, and there\u2019s no stress on anyone. My friend\u2019s husband actually loves that his wife does it for him (he\u2019s the late one.)", "NTA - I actually do this to my mom lol!!! I tell her we have to leave anywhere from 10-30 mins before we do because she takes so long getting ready.", "NTA \n\nSome people are perpetually late, and your wife sounds like one of those people.   She should know how long it takes her to get ready and plan accordingly.\n\nShe may also not care too much about being on the dot punctual, so if you are going to a party or something where arrival times are a little more flexible, maybe you can give her more leeway on those occassions.", "NTA.  Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  This will only work a few times though, once she catches on, you won't be able to do it anymore.", "NTA\n\nI do it to my sister all the time.  I hate being late and she always arrives to functions late.  I told her Thanksgiving dinner was at 3pm but it was actually at 4pm.  Guess who arrived on-time.", "INFO: \n\nHave you tried to actually talk to her about this, her running late to everything?", "NTA. It's actually very rude to others when you're constantly late. And honestly this doesn't hurt anyone. Hopefully 30 mins is enough time. Lol.", "Inconsiderate not just of OP's time but of the time of others at whatever they're going to.  For some things it might not matter so much -- e.g. an evening-long party where people will be coming and going for some time -- but for others with a set start time, such as a sit-down dinner or a show or simply meeting up to go somewhere else, it can be quite an imposition for everyone from co-attendees to event staff.", "There isn't a compromise for people like this.  I've known plenty.  You can remind them when to get ready, and they'll take longer because they can.  Then rush at the end.  \n\nIf she is an adult like this, she is likely not going to change.", "You're absolutely correct.  My sister is always late.  One time the whole family was going out to dinner for my birthday and she ended up coming when we were leaving the restaurant.  The sad part is she had my cake."]}
