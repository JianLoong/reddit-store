If anything, she is being inconsiderate of your time. People who are chronically late and make other people be late with them are seriously annoying, and if telling her that you need to be somewhere half an hour earlier than you have to is the only way to get her to be ready on time, so be it.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfair of her to constantly make you late when you obviously value being punctual. I hate when people can't manage their time and are always late; I have an ex like this and it drove me absolutely crazy. There were times when I told him we had to be somewhere earlier than we did because I knew he'd make us late.\n\nI also just left without him a few times, so that's another option.", "NTA I would do the same. It hurts no-one and actually helps", "NTA \n\nHowever, I'd prefer for you to sit down and have a talk about her disrespect of your time and the time of others. Find a way to reach a compromise that involves you helping her start to get ready sooner. That could be reminding her to start or building more time into the schedule when you have control over when things start. Any time caring enough for each other to negotiate what you need and compromise can be achieved rather than lying, it's a good idea.", "NTA. I have friends who I tell need to be places and hour before they do because then they will arrive on time. Everyone wins.", "NTA, You're just looking for a reasonable way to arrive on time, which is not an A-hole move.", "WNBTA\n\nMy husband does this all the time. It\u2019s never bothered me when I found out", "NTA! She won't be harmed by this", "NTA.\n\nIt is a lie, but its a lie that harms no one.  \n\nThere are a few options, none of which are good.  You can wait around for her, and you both show up late, which is rude.  You can lie to her about the time and get there when you should (lying).  Or you can leave without her, which will probably piss her off. \n\nYour solutions is probably the best one.  But it won't always work, because eventually she will catch on and start adjusting accordingly.", "I do this with my gf because she likes to push it and we normally still end up almost being late places", "NTA. We had to do this with my mom.", "NTA, I'm time blind and telling me earlier time to be somwhere is very helpful for me. Yes on rare occasions I arrive at time and I have to wait for others, but it is still better than have everyone wait for me. Unfortunately it don't work if I'm the one who is putting time in tha calendar because I'd remember it and I will come even later \ud83d\ude22", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Over 40 years later and nothing has changed.", "Meh.  NTA.\n\nI do this for my friend who is always late. I will say, though, that my husband -- who is never on time -- did it to me for a while to make sure the kids were ready when he wanted to leave and that really, really annoyed me. So approach something like this with some caution.", "Honestly it really depends on how shes likely to react if she finds out. Like is she bothered by being late or by you being bothered by it?? i dont think youd be the ass for doing it but how shed feel about it when finding out is what matters-if its gonna be a problem you might just be exchanging one headache for another. \n\ni personally would love it if somebody else were able to do this for me cos time....doesnt really work for me like it does everybody else lol but some people are weird about shit so. \n\nBased on your post it doesnt seem like shes doing it intentionally but you feel the way you do and shes not done anything to accommodate that so maybe she just doesnt care or something. But like have yall talked about this at all?? Cos thats the other important thing. If youve expressed your concerns and shes just continued on the same then i say go for it, just remember the headache thing.", "Nta, how would she figure it out if you guys are arriving on time ?", "NTA. This is something we very commonly do in Hispanic families because unfortunately that is one stereotype that often holds true in my experience and we tend to run late. It hurts no one to do this.", "NTA and this is common. It feels bad to lie to people, but ultimately it's better to tell a white lie so you arrive on time than to micro-manage her getting ready because you're anxious about being late. I would say when I have discussed this with late friends, they have found it amusing and not offensive because they *know* how long they take to get ready.", "NTA - the number of people I know that do this to/for their partners is hilarious. It\u2019s common, and there\u2019s no stress on anyone. My friend\u2019s husband actually loves that his wife does it for him (he\u2019s the late one.)", "NTA - I actually do this to my mom lol!!! I tell her we have to leave anywhere from 10-30 mins before we do because she takes so long getting ready.", "NTA \n\nSome people are perpetually late, and your wife sounds like one of those people.   She should know how long it takes her to get ready and plan accordingly.\n\nShe may also not care too much about being on the dot punctual, so if you are going to a party or something where arrival times are a little more flexible, maybe you can give her more leeway on those occassions.", "NTA.  Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  This will only work a few times though, once she catches on, you won't be able to do it anymore.", "NTA\n\nI do it to my sister all the time.  I hate being late and she always arrives to functions late.  I told her Thanksgiving dinner was at 3pm but it was actually at 4pm.  Guess who arrived on-time.", "INFO: \n\nHave you tried to actually talk to her about this, her running late to everything?", "NTA. It's actually very rude to others when you're constantly late. And honestly this doesn't hurt anyone. Hopefully 30 mins is enough time. Lol.", "Inconsiderate not just of OP's time but of the time of others at whatever they're going to.  For some things it might not matter so much -- e.g. an evening-long party where people will be coming and going for some time -- but for others with a set start time, such as a sit-down dinner or a show or simply meeting up to go somewhere else, it can be quite an imposition for everyone from co-attendees to event staff.", "There isn't a compromise for people like this.  I've known plenty.  You can remind them when to get ready, and they'll take longer because they can.  Then rush at the end.  \n\nIf she is an adult like this, she is likely not going to change.", "You're absolutely correct.  My sister is always late.  One time the whole family was going out to dinner for my birthday and she ended up coming when we were leaving the restaurant.  The sad part is she had my cake.", "NTA. I had to do this with my dad growing under so we weren\u2019t consistently walking in late to weddings, funerals and family gatherings. If she wants to spend time on her appearance then she can start getting ready earlier.", "NTA I DO THIS TO MY COUSIN EVERY YEAR FOR THANKSGIVING AND XMAS HE ARRIVES UP TO TWO HOURS LATE FOR EVERYTHING. SO I TELL HIM WE ARE EATING AT 12 AND HE USUALLY ARRIVES AROUND 3 WHICH IS THE TIME WE ARE EATING LMAO EVERY DAMN YEAR. IF I TOLD HIM WE ARE EATING AT 3 HE WOULD SHOW UP AT 5 WITH A SALAD OR SOME SIDES AND DINNER WOULD BE OVER.", "NTA I started doing this with my wife and the first 2 events she was a little upset but now I think she appreciates it.", "You can care about your appearance and arrive on time.  It is disrespectful of her to be that late all of the time.  You are NTA.", "NTA. We used to tell one grandma a time an hour earlier. And the other an hour later. They\u2019d show up at the same time. It\u2019s what needed to happen to keep things running smoothly!", "NTA. I always lie to my partner about the time we have to leave to get somewhere on time. Then we end up arriving exactly when I'd like to. He is aware I do this and appreciates it\n\nI am like you and really don't like being late to anything, so the trick means he is ready on time and doesn't feel rushed and I don't have any anxiety about missing the beginning of whatever we are doing", "NTA.. I literally have my family send my mother invites with the wrong time on them so they know she will be in time because the party or whatever actually starts an hour later. It works like a charm and she doesn\u2019t even notice.", "Her appearance is not more important than being punctual to events that have start times or if you have plans that involve others. I have acquaintances who've been downgraded from friends because they pulled this crap . It's not really about her appearance. It's an extremely annoying power play.", "NTA. There are a couple of friends my group of friends does this to as they are always late. The only issue will be if she works it out and starts getting ready even later to compensate. Some people just don't like being punctual, and it's pretty inconsiderate to be honest.", "NTA. I do it all the time & don't feel the least bit guilty for it. I like being early for things & being anywhere even close to the time or later makes me anxious.", "NTA. My current gf is also like this. She's cares deeply about her appearance and I am always supportive, i love her deeply and always want her to feel confortable when we go out, especially to meet friends. My dad was a watch maker by trade, so time and keeping time has always had a huge influence on my life. Being punctual shows people that you respect their time, which is a precious resource for most of us. I will often tell my gf that engagements are 30mins prior to what they actually are because I know her appearance stresses her. Defs not AH and actually from where I stand, it's considerate to both your partner and the friends/family/coworkers you're meeting.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough the problem with the \"half hour off\" thing is one day you're still going to be 10-15 minutes late to something because she'll take 45 minutes extra to get ready.\n\nWhat you might try is \"we have to leave at time X and the car is rolling with or without you in it, plan accordingly.\"  It's kind of the nuclear option, but it also shows people that what they're doing is not cool.", "NTA we tell my MIL to be somewhere a hour before real starting time. She normally comes strolling in about 15 minutes before start time. It\u2019s a running thing in my husband family because she is usually 45 minutes to a hour late.", "NTA but you are just enabling her bad behavior if you do that. She can start getting ready earlier so you both are on time. I would have a serious discussion with her about this and hopefully she will be receptive. If she\u2019s not receptive to actively changing her bad behavior I\u2019d say I am leaving at this specific time and then leave at that time. If she\u2019s not ready she can meet you there. It may sound harsh but there really is no excuse for her behavior. I care about my appearance too and just make sure I start getting ready with enough time to be on time.", "NTA, I lose track of time and can run behind, so I always put stuff in my calendar half an hour before so I can account for my own losing track of time + traffic delays. The main hold up in my life is my husband, because he's even worse than I am \ud83d\ude12 I can only account for my own lateness", "NTA. If she's so concerned with her appearance then she needs to allocate enough time.  It is so rude and inconsiderate of other people to be chronically late.  It's not cute.   It's not fashionable. It is rude as hell.  I finally stopped waiting on late people. I would leave her at home if she's not ready by the designated time.  If she misses enough events then she may do something about it.", "NTA.  I also have a reputation for being chronically late.  Somehow, I consistently underestimate how long it will take me to finish something.  It\u2019s never intentional\u2014and although I understand why people don\u2019t believe it\u2014I genuinely do feel very guilty when other people end up waiting for me.  I\u2019ve made efforts to trick myself about arrival times, etc., but it\u2019s difficult to maintain and it often backfires.\n\nWhile your wife might be mad, I\u2019d be grateful if my husband did this for me.", "NTA.  Or, if you are, you are in good company.  My mother has always been 30 minutes behind, and when I was young my Dad and I started doing what you said - telling her we needed to be places 30 minutes earlier.  Honestly, it worked.  She didn\u2019t find out until a few years ago, after about 40 years of us doing this - she was surprised, then a little hurt, then angry, then laughed about it, because she admits it did work.", "NTA. I do this with my best friend.", "In contrast, I did this with my partner once, and he was hurt and embarrassed and upset.  We talked through it, everything from why that bothered him to why the previous lack of timing had bothered me -- and how we'd actually left on time for once, and what we could do to make that happen without either of us getting frustrated or upset.  For things where timing mattered, I started noting that we had to be on time for it, and he started making a lot more effort for those.  Mileage and people vary, of course.\n\nThis next bit falls into the Not My Responsibility column, but I also started framing expectations differently -- not \"it starts at 9 am\" but \"we need to leave here by 7:30; when do you want to be up and in the shower for that to work?\"  That helped a lot, too.", "Yep, this was my dad growing up. We always got upset when he made us late and told him how inconsiderate it was for everyone and asked him to make sure he was ready on time. Do you think he cared? Nope. It\u2019s a form of selfishness that\u2019s hard to understand for a lot of people.", "While I agree with most of the comments, I just wanted to nuance that some neuro divergent folks really *really* struggle with this and it's not because they don't care (ADHD being an example). [not saying this is OPs partners case, just thought it was important to mention]"]}
