You can wait around for her, and you both show up late, which is rude.  You can lie to her about the time and get there when you should (lying).

It feels bad to lie to people, but ultimately it's better to tell a white lie so you arrive on time than to micro-manage her getting ready because you're anxious about being late.

For some things it might not matter so much -- e.g. an evening-long party where people will be coming and going for some time -- but for others with a set start time, such as a sit-down dinner or a show or simply meeting up to go somewhere else, it can be quite an imposition for everyone from co-attendees to event staff.", "There isn't a compromise for people like this.

Then we end up arriving exactly when I'd like to.

I have acquaintances who've been downgraded from friends because they pulled this crap . It's not really about her appearance. It's an extremely annoying power play.", "NTA. There are a couple of friends my group of friends does this to as they are always late. The only issue will be if she works it out and starts getting ready even later to compensate. Some people just don't like being punctual, and it's pretty inconsiderate to be honest.", "NTA. I do it all the time & don't feel the least bit guilty for it.

She's cares deeply about her appearance and I am always supportive, i love her deeply and always want her to feel confortable when we go out, especially to meet friends. My dad was a watch maker by trade, so time and keeping time has always had a huge influence on my life. Being punctual shows people that you respect their time, which is a precious resource for most of us. I will often tell my gf that engagements are 30mins prior to what they actually are because I know her appearance stresses her.

It\u2019s a running thing in my husband family because she is usually 45 minutes to a hour late.", "NTA but you are just enabling her bad behavior if you do that. She can start getting ready earlier so you both are on time. I would have a serious discussion with her about this and hopefully she will be receptive. If she\u2019s not receptive to actively changing her bad behavior I\u2019d say I am leaving at this specific time and then leave at that time. If she\u2019s not ready she can meet you there. It may sound harsh but there really is no excuse for her behavior. I care about my appearance too and just make sure I start getting ready with enough time to be on time.", "NTA, I lose track of time and can run behind, so I always put stuff in my calendar half an hour before so I can account for my own losing track of time + traffic delays. The main hold up in my life is my husband, because he's even worse than I am \ud83d\ude12 I can only account for my own lateness", "NTA. If she's so concerned with her appearance then she needs to allocate enough time.  It is so rude and inconsiderate of other people to be chronically late.  It's not cute.   It's not fashionable. It is rude as hell.  I finally stopped waiting on late people. I would leave her at home if she's not ready by the designated time.  If she misses enough events then she may do something about it.", "NTA.  I also have a reputation for being chronically late.  Somehow, I consistently underestimate how long it will take me to finish something.  It\u2019s never intentional\u2014and although I understand why people don\u2019t believe it\u2014I genuinely do feel very guilty when other people end up waiting for me.  I\u2019ve made efforts to trick myself about arrival times, etc., but it\u2019s difficult to maintain and it often backfires.\n\nWhile your wife might be mad, I\u2019d be grateful if my husband did this for me.", "NTA.  Or, if you are, you are in good company.  My mother has always been 30 minutes behind, and when I was young my Dad and I started doing what you said - telling her we needed to be places 30 minutes earlier.  Honestly, it worked.  She didn\u2019t find out until a few years ago, after about 40 years of us doing this - she was surprised, then a little hurt, then angry, then laughed about it, because she admits it did work.", "NTA. I do this with my best friend.", "In contrast, I did this with my partner once, and he was hurt and embarrassed and upset.  We talked through it, everything from why that bothered him to why the previous lack of timing had bothered me -- and how we'd actually left on time for once, and what we could do to make that happen without either of us getting frustrated or upset.  For things where timing mattered, I started noting that we had to be on time for it, and he started making a lot more effort for those.  Mileage and people vary, of course.\n\nThis next bit falls into the Not My Responsibility column, but I also started framing expectations differently -- not \"it starts at 9 am\" but \"we need to leave here by 7:30; when do you want to be up and in the shower for that to work?\"  That helped a lot, too.", "Yep, this was my dad growing up. We always got upset when he made us late and told him how inconsiderate it was for everyone and asked him to make sure he was ready on time. Do you think he cared? Nope. It\u2019s a form of selfishness that\u2019s hard to understand for a lot of people.", "While I agree with most of the comments, I just wanted to nuance that some neuro divergent folks really *really* struggle with this and it's not because they don't care (ADHD being an example). [not saying this is OPs partners case, just thought it was important to mention]", "NTA, I do that all the time. And I am just calculating her delay as part of the travel time and therefore it is truthful.", "Do it I had to do the same thing ,I invited my friend to church it start @11 I told her it start @ 9 am can u believe even when church was over 1 pm she still wasn't there  . Do what u have to do I hate being late too .", "NTA, to be consistently late like this is very inconsiderate of other people's time, and very rude.  She can get ready an hour earlier.  Try it once,  maybe twice, and see if she times it just so that you're still half an hour \"late\".  It's not unethical to be punctual.", "NTA if thsts what you want to do then fine. I personally would give a time and if they weren't ready...then I'd go on my own. There's no excuse for not being ready at the right time...the odd occasion then yes...but having to lie about a time tells me she's doing it everytime...so I'd just leave her behind and tell her to make her own way there when she's ready", "NTA...  We do this with family members every year.  If dinner is at 4:00 pm.  We tell them 2:00pm..... They arrive at 4:00 pm. Any other time then holidays..  it's a 30 min wait, then I leave\n\nIt's so disrespectful...  It's like your flipping the bird, well saying \"My time is more valuable, then yours.\"", "NTA.   But the fact that you don't fault \"her\" for the problem is a problem.  It is her fault.  You enable the behavior by allowing it and making excuses for her, and think that by lying to her it fixes it.  Short term it does, but this wouldn't bother you if it actually fixed the problem.", "NTA But this will only work a time or two until she figures it out.", "NTA, I\u2019m always late to things like that and when my family does that it makes me on time and I feel better", "NTA.  Some people are just bad at estimating time and how long it takes to get ready.  I don't think it's a problem to tell a little white lie here.  Just do it with kindness and love and you should be fine.", "NTA. I\u2019m chronically disorganized and not always a great judge of how long things actually take, so I\u2019m often late. I hate it and am trying to improve. \n\nMy BF is always early, which I admire him for. He will start getting ready 3 hours before he has to leave. But it annoys me sometimes because one event can take then up a good chunk of the day and nothing else gets done. So we compromise. He hustles me out the door in plenty time, but doesn\u2019t complain that I don\u2019t start as early as he does. He has his routines and I have my ADD. We somehow make it work.", "NTA everybody has done this to me my whole life, and honestly, I need it.", ">I don't fault her for it\n\nYou should. It's an intentional choice on her part to not care about others by doing that.\n\nNTA but this won't fix it long term; if she catches on she might start getting ready even later lol", "NAH: I am chronically late and also hate being late, when I start falling behind schedule I get anxious, which makes me more late. What I really like is to plan to get coffee on the way to wherever I am going. If we get out in time, I get the reward of coffee, and if we don't have time for coffee we still get to the event on time. \n You and your wife need to talk and find a solution that makes you both feel good(which might be you telling her you need to be there earlier, but don't lie with our permission)", "You are a smart doing it that way.  Girl friend is the same way.  Should of just told her it\u2019s starts 1/2 hr earlier than it really does.", "NTA we did that to my mom for years...I think I was in high school by the time she figured it out, and by then she laughed about it. As long as you aren't mean how you go about it I don't think it's a problem.", "NTA, we have an aunt we do rhis to because she's always 30 minutes late to whatever time she's given xD", "NTA\nListen, I am late to almost everything regardless of how hard I try to be on time because one of my biggest ADHD symptoms is \u201ctime blindness\u201d \nI just have no actual concept of how long something will truly take, and believe me I have TRIED!!! My partner is like you and quite almost anxiously punctual, because he hates being late in any way and likes to not feel rushed. I told him early on to straight up lie to me about what time we have to be somewhere because chances are we will still be late to the earlier time he told me! It\u2019s one of the only ways he can get me to be on time and I\u2019m thankful for it all the time. Being late is awful to me but no matter how hard I work at it and try, so many other factors come in to play that I didn\u2019t consider. You are so so so absolutely not the asshole for trying to help your wife be more punctual, and the fact that you even came here to check because you feel it could be seen as unethical, speaks volumes to your intent behind the desire to try to help her in this way.", "NTA she is for not respecting you and other people by consistently being late and not making an effort to change", "The issue is not about your wife caring about her appearance. It is about her not caring to start on her appearance - if it matters to her - in a timely fashion. NTA.", "NTA, and I have often observed that people like this seem to have no trouble showing up on time for work, or doctor's appointments; in other words, when it benefits THEM to be punctual. It's only when it inconveniences OTHERS that they can't seem to get ready or out the door on time.", "NTA\n\nYour lateness is her fault. Full stop.\n\nA functional adult should be able to get ready in time. If she needs that much time she should start getting ready earlier.\n\nI'd have started leaving without her, so you're at least less of an AH than I am!", "NTA - we used to do this with a family member who was always one hour late and then he was on time.  Being consistently late is rude and inconsiderate of others, so I would say, whatever works.", "Not gonna say Y T A, because I know how frustrating this is. But lying is almost never the right thing to do. Instead, tell her the truth: \"The event is at \\[x time\\], and I will be leaving at \\[y time\\]. If you're not ready I will go alone\". Then do it. After a few times she'll probably start getting ready earlier.", "My granny, bless her, knew she was predisposed to this type of behaviour and took it upon herself to set all the clocks in her life forward by half an hour so she always thought she was running late. \n\nUnfortunately she was too smart for her own games and whenever one of us was fooled by the time she would just say \u201coh that\u2019s half an hour fast.\u201d Her tardiness never changed. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, but this won\u2019t work for very long. You\u2019ll need to address the root cause of the behaviour if you really want it to change.", "Well, we did that with our friend (only difference is that she could be late anywhere between 1-3 hours) and she got pissed AF when she figured out what we are doing because once she came earlier then everyone else (ops!). But we told her that in the future we will just leave if she doesn't come on time and she learned her lesson. So OP could also expect her reaction to go in that other direction, but if his wife is a normal person, she will understand later on when she calms down and figures out how disrespectful her behaviour is. NTA OP", "I was thinking along the same lines as your last part.\n\nMy spouse admits they have time blindness issues, and has for years. When there is an important event, they actively think about how long it will take to get there, then add cushion to figure out when to aim to be leaving. They plan accordingly from there.\n\nFor most events, leaving on or close to ontime is not a problem.\n\nIt usually only goes sideways when it gets to packing for long road trips. Mainly because of the amount of packing that ends up being needed day of (food & car). Flying trips, the packing is usually done at least two days in advance. Which eliminates a lot of last minute stress.", "yeah, this is why my family and friend group have a whole list of people that we just lie about the time to.\n\nthis was particularly frustrating with my uncle, when my grandmother would insist that we wait for him. it's literally a family joke about him being \"on the subway\" (just got on it) or \"at such-and-such street\" (in another borough.) Because we've heard them all and how long it's taken from the various \"this is where i am\" for him to get places.", "NTA\n\n\n\nI can be a chronically late person. I've gotten better over the years, but between poor time management, not giving enough time for traffic, not waking up early enough, etc...I have had my share of being late. And so when I say I understand why you want to do it, I really do *get it*. My one friend has periodically told me earlier start times for events because of this, and I have zero problem with it. I have been the disrespectful one, I am not offended when she does what she has to do to make sure I'm on time.\n\n\n\nI think you should cover your ass by addressing it at least once with her. Ask her if she realizes how late she is most of the time, tell her how it makes you feel, etc. And maybe, at most, communicate timing issues differently. I've learned my husband and I have drastically different takes on \"I'm not in a rush\" to get going somewhere. So I have to ask \"What time do you want to do x thing?\" Because when left to my own devices, time passes me VERY quickly without me realizing it.\n\n\n\nBut once you've had that conversation, if there's no improvement, just do it. It's either that or start telling her that you'll be leaving on time, with or without her. Maybe the embarrassment of being the only person late will help her.", " We had to do this to my brother. We would tell him we needed to leave an hour before we actually needed to.  \n\nIn my opinion, people who are chronically late are narcissistic, arrogant, and selfish.", "NTA \nThis kinda solves your problem. Although it might not work out in the long term. Sooner or later she will realize it. I don't know what kind of person your partner is. So you should keep in mind how she will react when she finds out. I would still suggest trying to talk it out with her. She can time her getting ready process a few times and then use it in the future. \nAbout your dilemma, it is a bit wrong but it doesn't harm anyone in any way. Hence, not unethical imo", "NTA.  Doing this pretty much saved my marriage.  I was a military brat and the time on the invitation meant the time you were supposed to arrive.  Even one minute late was unacceptable.  My husband has a habit of being late, so I started telling him we had to be there 1/2 hour before instead of the real time.  It's worked out wonderfully.  He knows that I'm doing it, but that doesn't seem to matter.  We've been happily married for over 30 years.", "NTA. This is not unethical at all. Your wife's near-chronic lateness is incredibly rude to your hosts, any servers, etc. that might have had to delay due to her tardiness, and those around her.\n\nI have seen other posts here in the past (there was a classic one where a groom gave his chronically late mother a ceremony time a full 2 hours before the actual time, which is when she arrived) where the on-time partner has simply given the late partner an incorrect start time. Yes, they get caught, and yes, the tardy partner is upset, but it's usually done out of desperation ***to be polite to any hosts and arrive on time***.", "NTA - I grew up in a house where all the clocks were set 10mins early. Ok that was my mother lying to herself as much as me. But it is a reasonable thing to do if repeatedly late. The main issue is once she clocks it, you need to set time 35mins early etc. \n\nHowever it might be wiser to keep a diary so she can't delude it isn't every time, talk about  how it makes you feel and check that there isn'ta reason why she is taking so long to get ready. Sometimes people procrastinate and prefer to arrive slightly later because dread small talk in small groups. But discuss it first if not already done.", "NTA at all. I have set all our clocks in the house about ten minutes fast to help keep my bf on time. It saves a lot of stress and frustration.", "NTA - but I would just stop bringing her places till shr learns how to be an adult", "NTA although a less duplicitous way would maybe be saying \"we need to leave by\" or \"we need to be ready by\". Rather than lying about the actual start time, just avoid specifically stating the actual start time.", "Its fine if she wants to take care in it, but then she has to start earlier. Its not that difficult.\n\nNTA", "NTA. My college roommate did this to me when we would go to parties or meet people at a bar. She told me a little bit before she moved out when I commented on how nice it was that we were like the same amount time late to things and she said \u201cNope, we\u2019re always on time!\u201d \ud83d\ude02 I actually kind of appreciate when people do this.", "Nta I  leave without people. If I say we need to leave at 1 to get there on time, and you're still a half hour away from being ready, then you can drive yourself.", "NTA my partner has adhd and we have to do this all the time. All our clocks are set 10 minutes ahead", "Nta, my boyfriend is the same way. I'm a lady and I always try to look nice and it takes a little while, but I'm always on time to things if it's just me. My boyfriend always makes us late, unless I am almost literally on top of him, like a mom trying to get her kids ready for school in the morning. Funny thing is he hates being late, but he is nearly ALWAYS late.", "NTA. My boyfriend used to do this to me and it helped so much lol\n\nI was notorious for being late and I hated it. It was embarrassing but same as your wife, it was because me finishing my hair/makeup or picking out an outfit. Boyfriend would drive me up the wall with the \u201care you almost ready?\u201d \u201cHurry up!\u201d like it would make me go any faster? Eventually it led to me mentally telling myself events or whatnot started earlier so I can avoid being late and now I have this year long streak if not being late to anything.", "NTA I would tell her 45 minutes before , but I'm always early.  If your nit st least 5 minutes early you're late", "NTA - But she will probably be mad anyways bc her feelings are hurt now that she has to confront a fault she has, many humans react that way sadly", "NTA but she's probably going to be mad as a wet hen when she finds out.", "NTA. I had to do this with family or else they would\u2019ve been late for my baccalaureate and graduation. It is rude to leave people waiting because of poor time management. An emergency or once in a blue moon is understandable, but it shouldn\u2019t be a consistent thing. Your wife needs to start getting ready sooner.", "NTA. My dad did this for years because my mother is chronically late. I struggle with this too and my husband always gives me a range, which helps. I am better at being ready \"between 4 and 4:30\" than being ready by 4:30.", "NTA, I actually do that with my sister and BIL... It works like magic", "I personally wouldn't do that. The 1st time she finds out what time you are supposed to be somewhere and the time you told her are not the same, she will know you are a liar and that you broke her trust in you. I've seen that happen before when a few friends were dating. My ex used to always run late as well. I eventually told my ex that I am leaving at a certain time with or without you since I was tired of always being late. After the 2nd time when I left without my ex, my ex started getting ready early and we were never late again.", "I can't stand chronically late people. I also hate people who are obnoxiously early. Like, 5-30 minutes, sure. No big deal. I used to have this friend. She and her mom would always show up at least 2 hours before everything. 6pm for dinner? They'd be over at 3 or 4. My wedding? Showed up hours early to help, despite not being part of the bridal party or anything. Ended up just getting in the way and giving their unwanted opinions.", "HA! Reminds me of an I Love Lucy episode: after being too late she changes the clock to trick herself into being on time, but sets it behind instead of forward, so they become even later", "It's just as inconsiderate in the other direction. My dad has literally stated that being less than an hour early is equivalent to being late. He'll glare and swear and otherwise wear everyone else down until we allow ourselves to be dragged out. Then we get to either embarrass our hosts who aren't even close to ready or sit in a driveway or parking lot for an hour. People who waste everyone's time being late are awful but wasting time being too early hurts just as much.", "Oh yeah. I'd rather my guests be late than early", "NTA , some people do not have the sense of time", "NTA - I have a sister that is habitually 2 hours late.

Honestly, when people do this to me I give them 7 minutes grace. If, by 7 minutes after we were meant to leave they aren't ready,  I leave them behind. When I was a child and had to rely on my mother to take me places (no reliable public transport here, though I did leave to walk to school several times when she was supposed to take me for awards etc) I used to build in a 15-30 minute buffer. There's no shame in it. But if you're going to leave your girlfriend behind I suggest warning her when you discuss what time you're going to leave, if only to cover your ass.", "My family has been doing this for years. My dad's friends do it all the time, it's how you adjust stubborn people to real life. NTA\n\nETA spelling", "NTA. \nWe do this with my dad. If family dinner is at 5:30, we tell him 4:30. Sometimes 4 depending if there's a commute involved.", "I have a terrible time managing my time as well as being a huge procrastinator. This leads to me being constantly late. My sister apparently told me dinner was a half hour earlier to get me there and I actually ended up being on time. I basically just sat there while she and her daughters finished up stuff. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unethical. It\u2019s kinda embarrassing for me but that\u2019s a me problem.  NTA", "NTA, I use to do this when we would go out.  \n\nShe's inconsiderate not intensome people  can't grasp the concept of being respectful of other people's time.", "NTA I do that to my friends who are chronically late all the time ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s an important occasion.

I am always late to places  ( I'm  working on it all  just to make it clear I don't think it's ok to live like this) and I wouldn't be angry if someone did this to me. I'd be relieved actually. The downside is it'll only work a couple of times. It's best if you revise the plan beforehand so you can help her adjust her expectations and start preparing sooner or if she starts preparing some things in advance to allow herself more time for actual work (choose outfit beforehand, lay out items in a way that's useful, prep bag and important items - documents/gifts for hosts etc) - those are some actions that help me. YWNBTA but encourage her to work on it instead.", "There was a post on here a while ago about a chronically late woman who was more than an hour late to her own birthday party.

You would be one of you didn't lie about the start time.", "NTA. The rest of the humans you interact with appreciate this.", "NTA\n\nI always lie to chronically late people about the time. Chronically late people are annoying as all hell, even if they don't mean to be.\n\nFirst, try to address the issue; explain how much her being late bothers you and see if she adjusts. If not, just lie about the time. You tried the nice way first.", "NTA -- Honestly, if I found out someone had done this for me, I'd think it was hilarious and genius \ud83d\ude02\n\nHowever, I also wanted to address some of the comments I'm seeing here, and hopefully offer an alternate perspective. Forgive me in advance for getting on my soapbox here; this is something I'm sensitive about \ud83d\ude05\n\nA lot of folks here are talking about people being disrespectful of other's valuable time, and don't get me wrong, that's absolutely a valid point. It's not fair to everyone who puts in the effort to be on time, not at all. And there definitely ARE people out there who are genuinely straight-up inconsiderate like that, and they suck, for sure.\n\n*However *-- I don\u2019t wanna just scream and cry and wave the ADHD card everywhere, but I feel it's an equally valid point to bring up. Maybe it\u2019s applicable in this specific case or maybe it's not (I have neither the professional expertise nor personal knowledge of your wife to make that kind of call), but the fact remains that ADHD messes with a person's ability to perceive and manage time *drastically.* As a person with pretty severe ADHD, time management has been one of my biggest struggles for my entire life, and something I still grapple with as an adult and probably will continue to have lifelong issues with. My brain just has a hard time keeping track of the passage of time (what feels like 5 mins to me is actually much longer), or quantifying how long it will take to do a particular task (\"I can totally get dressed for this party in 20 minutes!\" (I cannot \ud83e\udd23)), or forgetting to account for things such as travel time/traffic (\"I have to be there at 6pm\" means just the time \"6pm\" gets stuck in my brain, and I forget that means I have to *be ready* by 5pm so I can sit through traffic). I don\u2019t mean to be late, or waste others' time, and I care *deeply* and feel awful about being chronically tardy. Unfortunately, all the guilt in the world doesn't change the fact that my brain is just wired up weird. Honestly, it's fucking exhausting. I try *so hard*, all the time, and barely meet the bare minimum for others' expectations.\n\nOf course, I'm not trying to excuse or absolve time-blind ADHDers of any responsibility. It's still important to be able to get to things on time, out of respect for others as well as yourself. And this is not an insurmountable issue. For example, I've learned that in order to get somewhere on time, I need to actually sit down the day before the event and plan out my entire \"getting ready process\" down to individual steps and literal 15-minute increments, which I set alarms for to help me keep track of time as I'm getting ready. And it works, more or less. Instead of being 10, 15, 30+ minutes late to everything, I'm on time to most things, and only occasionally 5-10 minutes late. I'm still not perfect, and I'm still known as \"the late friend,\" but I'm *WAY* better than I was and still improving.\n\nSo, perhaps if we can collectively approach the issue not by asking, \"why are you so lazy and inconsiderate,\" but instead saying, \"I see you struggle with planning out your time, so let's figure out some strategies to help with that,\" it would go a long way towards helping the time-blind people in your life 1) learn to manage things a bit better, and 2) feel less shameful and guilt-ridden for something that is ultimately *not* a true moral failing.\n\n/rant over, and if anyone actually read all that, thank you. Just. Thank you.", "NTA I have ADHD and time blindness and my family does this to me all the time. Honestly, I personally (I know not everyone does) appreciate this because I am embarrassed by the fact Im always late", "NTA but if you\u2019re worried about the ethics maybe instead of giving her a false arrival time, give her a generous \u201cwe should be ready to leave by\u201d time? So if you need to leave at 5:30 to be somewhere by 6, then instead of telling her when the event starts tell her \u201cbe ready to leave around 5.\u201d Then if she\u2019s ready by 5:30 you\u2019re good\n\nThat feels a little less deceptive to me", "My mother is neurodivergent in some way (we don't know but we're pretty sure she has ADHD) and, once my father died, she stopped being any where near on time to things. She was an hour and a half late to Mother's Day, her own birthday dinner, Christmas, and Thanksgiving last year alone. Is it because she's neurodivergent? Probably. Is that anyone's problem to manage other than hers? No. If she cared, she'd manage it - same with OP's partner.", "Well, I can't say anything for your mother and I'm sorry you have to deal with that situation but I'm just saying that \"if she cared she'd manage it\" is definitely not what the mental health professionals told us about my mum.", "Nta.

And it\u2019s worked every time", "I mean if you want to talk ethics, this could range from completely ethical to highly unethical depending on which philosophical hat you\u2019re wearing. But from a purely practical standpoint, with the information I have, my judgement is NTA. You would be an AH if you were a jerk about it, like if you pointed out what you\u2019re doing so you could scold her out of spite or frustration or both. But first, INFO: how many meaningful conversations have you had with your wife about how her actions makes you feel? INFO 2: are you or your wife part of a culture which does not place much importance on strict punctuality?", "NTA\n\nBut honestly, that doesn't sound like a viable solution.\n\nIt may sound harsh, but I might go with I'm leaving at X time and if you're not ready you'll have to find your own way there.", "My husband does this to me.  He tells me the time to be somewhere is 30min before the due time.  It pisses me off, but, I am always late and I can\u2019t seem to get myself together on time even when I really try.  So I see this as a compromise.  We get to be 20min early instead of 10min late and we both accept that its something I can\u2019t change. So NTA.  note - it only works if I don\u2019t know he is doing it.  So you can\u2019t put the clocks forward every time or it won\u2019t work.", "NTA, it would be unethical if you were just doing it to screw with her, but honestly it's more shitty that she doesn't care about anyone's time and is willing to be consistently late.\n\nBut honestly having dealt with people like this before, messing with her clocks isn't going to do anything, cuz as soon as she finds out they are switched, if she is choosing to be late she will just be late. Rather than going around changing all the clocks, you should address the core issue with her", "NTA - I have a very similar situation with my girlfriend. Running late to things makes me so anxious it completely ruins outings for me. Accidentally drank too much at a Halloween party to cope this year cuz of it.

Haha. \n\nSo definitely NTA.", "Yes, it really is the only solution for chronically late people. However, some tips:\n\nIf you consistently give half hour earlier start time, she will cotton on and not believe you when you give her times. You will need to escalate to an hour, and then 90 minutes. It\u2019s a slippery slope.\n\nThe key is to be variable. Give that extra half hour buffer for really important things. Where possible, give 15-20 minute increments. Give her earlier times for things where she won\u2019t notice she\u2019s early. Sometimes give her the right time and let her be late, especially social things that don\u2019t matter that much, but that will be embarrassing for her to be late to.\n\nAlso, my husband stopped being late so much when I required, if we were going to be late, that he call and apologize to the person we were inconveniencing.", "Ditto, just recently diagnosed with ADHD but my loved ones have been lying to me about start times for years.
