She's cares deeply about her appearance and I am always supportive, i love her deeply and always want her to feel confortable when we go out, especially to meet friends. My dad was a watch maker by trade, so time and keeping time has always had a huge influence on my life. Being punctual shows people that you respect their time, which is a precious resource for most of us.

I care about my appearance too and just make sure I start getting ready with enough time to be on time.", "NTA, I lose track of time and can run behind, so I always put stuff in my calendar half an hour before so I can account for my own losing track of time + traffic delays. The main hold up in my life is my husband, because he's even worse than I am \ud83d\ude12 I can only account for my own lateness", "NTA. If she's so concerned with her appearance then she needs to allocate enough time.  It is so rude and inconsiderate of other people to be chronically late.  It's not cute.   It's not fashionable. It is rude as hell.  I finally stopped waiting on late people. I would leave her at home if she's not ready by the designated time.  If she misses enough events then she may do something about it.", "NTA.  I also have a reputation for being chronically late.  Somehow, I consistently underestimate how long it will take me to finish something.  It\u2019s never intentional\u2014and although I understand why people don\u2019t believe it\u2014I genuinely do feel very guilty when other people end up waiting for me.  I\u2019ve made efforts to trick myself about arrival times, etc., but it\u2019s difficult to maintain and it often backfires.\n\nWhile your wife might be mad, I\u2019d be grateful if my husband did this for me.", "NTA.  Or, if you are, you are in good company.  My mother has always been 30 minutes behind, and when I was young my Dad and I started doing what you said - telling her we needed to be places 30 minutes earlier.  Honestly, it worked.  She didn\u2019t find out until a few years ago, after about 40 years of us doing this - she was surprised, then a little hurt, then angry, then laughed about it, because she admits it did work.", "NTA. I do this with my best friend.", "In contrast, I did this with my partner once, and he was hurt and embarrassed and upset.  We talked through it, everything from why that bothered him to why the previous lack of timing had bothered me -- and how we'd actually left on time for once, and what we could do to make that happen without either of us getting frustrated or upset.  For things where timing mattered, I started noting that we had to be on time for it, and he started making a lot more effort for those.  Mileage and people vary, of course.\n\nThis next bit falls into the Not My Responsibility column, but I also started framing expectations differently -- not \"it starts at 9 am\" but \"we need to leave here by 7:30; when do you want to be up and in the shower for that to work?\"  That helped a lot, too.", "Yep, this was my dad growing up. We always got upset when he made us late and told him how inconsiderate it was for everyone and asked him to make sure he was ready on time. Do you think he cared? Nope. It\u2019s a form of selfishness that\u2019s hard to understand for a lot of people.", "While I agree with most of the comments, I just wanted to nuance that some neuro divergent folks really *really* struggle with this and it's not because they don't care (ADHD being an example). [not saying this is OPs partners case, just thought it was important to mention]", "NTA, I do that all the time. And I am just calculating her delay as part of the travel time and therefore it is truthful.", "Do it I had to do the same thing ,I invited my friend to church it start @11 I told her it start @ 9 am can u believe even when church was over 1 pm she still wasn't there  . Do what u have to do I hate being late too .", "NTA, to be consistently late like this is very inconsiderate of other people's time, and very rude.  She can get ready an hour earlier.  Try it once,  maybe twice, and see if she times it just so that you're still half an hour \"late\".  It's not unethical to be punctual.", "NTA if thsts what you want to do then fine. I personally would give a time and if they weren't ready...then I'd go on my own. There's no excuse for not being ready at the right time...the odd occasion then yes...but having to lie about a time tells me she's doing it everytime...so I'd just leave her behind and tell her to make her own way there when she's ready", "NTA...  We do this with family members every year.  If dinner is at 4:00 pm.  We tell them 2:00pm..... They arrive at 4:00 pm. Any other time then holidays..  it's a 30 min wait, then I leave\n\nIt's so disrespectful...  It's like your flipping the bird, well saying \"My time is more valuable, then yours.\"", "NTA.   But the fact that you don't fault \"her\" for the problem is a problem.  It is her fault.  You enable the behavior by allowing it and making excuses for her, and think that by lying to her it fixes it.  Short term it does, but this wouldn't bother you if it actually fixed the problem.", "NTA But this will only work a time or two until she figures it out.", "NTA, I\u2019m always late to things like that and when my family does that it makes me on time and I feel better", "NTA.  Some people are just bad at estimating time and how long it takes to get ready.  I don't think it's a problem to tell a little white lie here.  Just do it with kindness and love and you should be fine.", "NTA. I\u2019m chronically disorganized and not always a great judge of how long things actually take, so I\u2019m often late. I hate it and am trying to improve. \n\nMy BF is always early, which I admire him for. He will start getting ready 3 hours before he has to leave. But it annoys me sometimes because one event can take then up a good chunk of the day and nothing else gets done. So we compromise. He hustles me out the door in plenty time, but doesn\u2019t complain that I don\u2019t start as early as he does. He has his routines and I have my ADD. We somehow make it work.", "NTA everybody has done this to me my whole life, and honestly, I need it.", ">I don't fault her for it\n\nYou should. It's an intentional choice on her part to not care about others by doing that.\n\nNTA but this won't fix it long term; if she catches on she might start getting ready even later lol", "NAH: I am chronically late and also hate being late, when I start falling behind schedule I get anxious, which makes me more late. What I really like is to plan to get coffee on the way to wherever I am going. If we get out in time, I get the reward of coffee, and if we don't have time for coffee we still get to the event on time. \n You and your wife need to talk and find a solution that makes you both feel good(which might be you telling her you need to be there earlier, but don't lie with our permission)", "You are a smart doing it that way.  Girl friend is the same way.  Should of just told her it\u2019s starts 1/2 hr earlier than it really does.", "NTA we did that to my mom for years...I think I was in high school by the time she figured it out, and by then she laughed about it. As long as you aren't mean how you go about it I don't think it's a problem.", "NTA, we have an aunt we do rhis to because she's always 30 minutes late to whatever time she's given xD", "NTA\nListen, I am late to almost everything regardless of how hard I try to be on time because one of my biggest ADHD symptoms is \u201ctime blindness\u201d \nI just have no actual concept of how long something will truly take, and believe me I have TRIED!!! My partner is like you and quite almost anxiously punctual, because he hates being late in any way and likes to not feel rushed. I told him early on to straight up lie to me about what time we have to be somewhere because chances are we will still be late to the earlier time he told me! It\u2019s one of the only ways he can get me to be on time and I\u2019m thankful for it all the time. Being late is awful to me but no matter how hard I work at it and try, so many other factors come in to play that I didn\u2019t consider. You are so so so absolutely not the asshole for trying to help your wife be more punctual, and the fact that you even came here to check because you feel it could be seen as unethical, speaks volumes to your intent behind the desire to try to help her in this way.", "NTA she is for not respecting you and other people by consistently being late and not making an effort to change", "The issue is not about your wife caring about her appearance. It is about her not caring to start on her appearance - if it matters to her - in a timely fashion.

Full stop.\n\nA functional adult should be able to get ready in time. If she needs that much time she should start getting ready earlier.\n\nI'd have started leaving without her, so you're at least less of an AH than I am!", "NTA - we used to do this with a family member who was always one hour late and then he was on time.  Being consistently late is rude and inconsiderate of others, so I would say, whatever works.", "Not gonna say Y T A, because I know how frustrating this is. But lying is almost never the right thing to do. Instead, tell her the truth: \"The event is at \\[x time\\], and I will be leaving at \\[y time\\]. If you're not ready I will go alone\". Then do it. After a few times she'll probably start getting ready earlier.", "My granny, bless her, knew she was predisposed to this type of behaviour and took it upon herself to set all the clocks in her life forward by half an hour so she always thought she was running late. \n\nUnfortunately she was too smart for her own games and whenever one of us was fooled by the time she would just say \u201coh that\u2019s half an hour fast.\u201d Her tardiness never changed. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, but this won\u2019t work for very long. You\u2019ll need to address the root cause of the behaviour if you really want it to change.", "Well, we did that with our friend (only difference is that she could be late anywhere between 1-3 hours) and she got pissed AF when she figured out what we are doing because once she came earlier then everyone else (ops!). But we told her that in the future we will just leave if she doesn't come on time and she learned her lesson. So OP could also expect her reaction to go in that other direction, but if his wife is a normal person, she will understand later on when she calms down and figures out how disrespectful her behaviour is. NTA OP", "I was thinking along the same lines as your last part.\n\nMy spouse admits they have time blindness issues, and has for years. When there is an important event, they actively think about how long it will take to get there, then add cushion to figure out when to aim to be leaving. They plan accordingly from there.\n\nFor most events, leaving on or close to ontime is not a problem.\n\nIt usually only goes sideways when it gets to packing for long road trips. Mainly because of the amount of packing that ends up being needed day of (food & car). Flying trips, the packing is usually done at least two days in advance. Which eliminates a lot of last minute stress.", "yeah, this is why my family and friend group have a whole list of people that we just lie about the time to.\n\nthis was particularly frustrating with my uncle, when my grandmother would insist that we wait for him. it's literally a family joke about him being \"on the subway\" (just got on it) or \"at such-and-such street\" (in another borough.) Because we've heard them all and how long it's taken from the various \"this is where i am\" for him to get places.", "NTA\n\n\n\nI can be a chronically late person. I've gotten better over the years, but between poor time management, not giving enough time for traffic, not waking up early enough, etc...I have had my share of being late. And so when I say I understand why you want to do it, I really do *get it*. My one friend has periodically told me earlier start times for events because of this, and I have zero problem with it. I have been the disrespectful one, I am not offended when she does what she has to do to make sure I'm on time.\n\n\n\nI think you should cover your ass by addressing it at least once with her. Ask her if she realizes how late she is most of the time, tell her how it makes you feel, etc. And maybe, at most, communicate timing issues differently. I've learned my husband and I have drastically different takes on \"I'm not in a rush\" to get going somewhere. So I have to ask \"What time do you want to do x thing?\" Because when left to my own devices, time passes me VERY quickly without me realizing it.\n\n\n\nBut once you've had that conversation, if there's no improvement, just do it. It's either that or start telling her that you'll be leaving on time, with or without her. Maybe the embarrassment of being the only person late will help her.", " We had to do this to my brother. We would tell him we needed to leave an hour before we actually needed to.  \n\nIn my opinion, people who are chronically late are narcissistic, arrogant, and selfish.", "NTA \nThis kinda solves your problem. Although it might not work out in the long term. Sooner or later she will realize it. I don't know what kind of person your partner is. So you should keep in mind how she will react when she finds out. I would still suggest trying to talk it out with her. She can time her getting ready process a few times and then use it in the future. \nAbout your dilemma, it is a bit wrong but it doesn't harm anyone in any way. Hence, not unethical imo", "NTA.  Doing this pretty much saved my marriage.  I was a military brat and the time on the invitation meant the time you were supposed to arrive.  Even one minute late was unacceptable.  My husband has a habit of being late, so I started telling him we had to be there 1/2 hour before instead of the real time.  It's worked out wonderfully.  He knows that I'm doing it, but that doesn't seem to matter.  We've been happily married for over 30 years.", "NTA. This is not unethical at all. Your wife's near-chronic lateness is incredibly rude to your hosts, any servers, etc. that might have had to delay due to her tardiness, and those around her.\n\nI have seen other posts here in the past (there was a classic one where a groom gave his chronically late mother a ceremony time a full 2 hours before the actual time, which is when she arrived) where the on-time partner has simply given the late partner an incorrect start time. Yes, they get caught, and yes, the tardy partner is upset, but it's usually done out of desperation ***to be polite to any hosts and arrive on time***.", "NTA - I grew up in a house where all the clocks were set 10mins early. Ok that was my mother lying to herself as much as me. But it is a reasonable thing to do if repeatedly late. The main issue is once she clocks it, you need to set time 35mins early etc. \n\nHowever it might be wiser to keep a diary so she can't delude it isn't every time, talk about  how it makes you feel and check that there isn'ta reason why she is taking so long to get ready. Sometimes people procrastinate and prefer to arrive slightly later because dread small talk in small groups. But discuss it first if not already done.", "NTA at all. I have set all our clocks in the house about ten minutes fast to help keep my bf on time. It saves a lot of stress and frustration.", "NTA - but I would just stop bringing her places till shr learns how to be an adult", "NTA although a less duplicitous way would maybe be saying \"we need to leave by\" or \"we need to be ready by\".

Its not that difficult.\n\nNTA", "NTA. My college roommate did this to me when we would go to parties or meet people at a bar.

All our clocks are set 10 minutes ahead", "Nta, my boyfriend is the same way. I'm a lady and I always try to look nice and it takes a little while, but I'm always on time to things if it's just me. My boyfriend always makes us late, unless I am almost literally on top of him, like a mom trying to get her kids ready for school in the morning. Funny thing is he hates being late, but he is nearly ALWAYS late.", "NTA. My boyfriend used to do this to me and it helped so much lol\n\nI was notorious for being late and I hated it. It was embarrassing but same as your wife, it was because me finishing my hair/makeup or picking out an outfit.

Eventually it led to me mentally telling myself events or whatnot started earlier so I can avoid being late and now I have this year long streak if not being late to anything.", "NTA I would tell her 45 minutes before , but I'm always early.  If your nit st least 5 minutes early you're late", "NTA - But she will probably be mad anyways bc her feelings are hurt now that she has to confront a fault she has, many humans react that way sadly", "NTA but she's probably going to be mad as a wet hen when she finds out.", "NTA. I had to do this with family or else they would\u2019ve been late for my baccalaureate and graduation. It is rude to leave people waiting because of poor time management. An emergency or once in a blue moon is understandable, but it shouldn\u2019t be a consistent thing. Your wife needs to start getting ready sooner.", "NTA. My dad did this for years because my mother is chronically late. I struggle with this too and my husband always gives me a range, which helps. I am better at being ready \"between 4 and 4:30\" than being ready by 4:30.", "NTA, I actually do that with my sister and BIL... It works like magic", "I personally wouldn't do that. The 1st time she finds out what time you are supposed to be somewhere and the time you told her are not the same, she will know you are a liar and that you broke her trust in you. I've seen that happen before when a few friends were dating. My ex used to always run late as well. I eventually told my ex that I am leaving at a certain time with or without you since I was tired of always being late. After the 2nd time when I left without my ex, my ex started getting ready early and we were never late again.", "I can't stand chronically late people. I also hate people who are obnoxiously early. Like, 5-30 minutes, sure. No big deal. I used to have this friend. She and her mom would always show up at least 2 hours before everything. 6pm for dinner? They'd be over at 3 or 4. My wedding? Showed up hours early to help, despite not being part of the bridal party or anything. Ended up just getting in the way and giving their unwanted opinions.", "HA! Reminds me of an I Love Lucy episode: after being too late she changes the clock to trick herself into being on time, but sets it behind instead of forward, so they become even later", "It's just as inconsiderate in the other direction. My dad has literally stated that being less than an hour early is equivalent to being late. He'll glare and swear and otherwise wear everyone else down until we allow ourselves to be dragged out. Then we get to either embarrass our hosts who aren't even close to ready or sit in a driveway or parking lot for an hour. People who waste everyone's time being late are awful but wasting time being too early hurts just as much.", "Oh yeah. I'd rather my guests be late than early"]}
