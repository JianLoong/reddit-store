(my children will never be homeless, they can stay with me if she cant provide them housing)\n\n2)I understand if i refused financial support of any kind to my children thats fucked up. I still pay for their food/clothes/medicine though. The support i give currently is about 3x of what my previous child support order was before we got back together. If they get evicted my kids can come live with me. They love my place, still the prospect of them being \"homeless\" even for a day might make me TA.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
