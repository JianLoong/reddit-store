He sounds shallow and hurtful and I think you should find someone more kind.", "You have family photos up and he never bothered to take an interest.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned you also wouldn\u2019t have to tell someone you\u2019re the only blonde in a fam of brunettes. You\u2019re dating each other, not the family.\n\nNTA. He reacted poorly.", "His reaction is NOT normal. NTA. Does he legitimately have a problem with little people, or is he concerned that if you were to have kids they would be little people too?\n\nWhat's going on with him? This is weird ableism and should be a red flag about your relationship. But get to the bottom of his reaction.\n\nAlso, how stupid is he. If you have pictures everywhere, how has he not noticed \ud83d\ude44", "Well, you dropped a bit of an info-bomb on him. I honestly think NTA because if it never came up, it never came up. But, at the same time, have you never talked about yourself and your family in 6 months? Has he never shown interest in your family and your photos? Weird. I'd give your bf a couple of days to digest and then see how he responds. Overall, though, it doesn't sound like a lasting relationship. I'd think he'd be more curious than angry or scared if the relationship were to last. But, I don't think that's on you. NTA", "NTA. It is a bit weird that he never looked at the pics of you and your family in all this time. You never did a tour of the flat and said \u201cso this is my pics with my family\u201d? That might be a relatively fast way to find out if anyone is weird about dwarfism, but that\u2019s up to you to say.\n\nAlso, what does he need to get comfortable with? Like, your family isn\u2019t in the mafia or something like that, there\u2019s nothing to get comfortable with beyond asking: \u201cis there anything that bigger people do that I should absolutely avoid when meeting them, besides the obvious (not joking about height, no snow white comments, etc)?\u201d", "NTA - How did this dude not notice any of ur pictures in ur apartment. It seems like he was just unobservant. His whole reaction has a sprinkle ignorance in it.\n\nedit. Nah when rereading again he sounds critically ignorant. He expected smt different but then blamed you when it wasn't to his expectations.", "NTA\n\nI would ask him to tell you how this changes the seriousness of the relationship for him. I think his answer will show you who he is.", "NTA - at first I was like \"wtf, why on earth would he care?\" and the only thing I can think of is that he has the misconception that that means it's likely to be passed on to your kids. You might want to ask him that, and clarify that that's not actually the case. Otherwise, I have no idea why he would freak out about it. \n\nBut you're NTA anyways, because you're not responsible for his misconceptions. If it didn't come up naturally, there was no need to bring it up earlier. Doing it before he met your parents was appropriate, which you did.", "1000% NTA!\n\nThe most concerning part of it all is his accusation that you \"hid\" this information, which implies that he thinks dwarfism is shameful, embarrassing, or otherwise unsavory. Dwarfism is simply a characteristic that most of your family shares, and it sounds like you were just priming your boyfriend with key info about your family before he met them. That's a totally normal thing to do and could be about anything - political identity or personal beliefs, physical characteristics or abilities, income level, etc.\n\nSome people are suggesting that he may be thinking (and making assumptions) about how this affects your potential future as parents. If that's the case, he should ask you. Also, there shouldn't be a moral obligation to share information about one's personal reproductive abilities/genetics unless it's during a serious conversation about intentions or plans to raise children together.\n\nThis seems like a huge red flag to me, but you know him best, and if you feel inclined to give him a chance to rectify things, maybe you could offer an opportunity for him to ask questions about dwarfism in a judgement-free zone. Many ppl don't have much personal experience with folks with dwarfism and his poor reaction may represent his ignorance more than his core beliefs about the condition. You definitely shouldn't do this at the expense of you or your family's dignity, and you certainly deserve an apology from him.", "You did nothing wrong, but wow, (ex?) BF sure did, what an ass.\n\nYou did not \u201cfuck up,\u201d you did not \u201chide\u201d anything, you didn\u2019t try to \u201ctrick\u201d him and his reaction is not \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nThis is no different than if you were the only sighted, hearing, different skin-toned one in your family. \n\nHe did however show you who he really is and the bullet you will be dodging when you move on. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI suppose his reaction was caused by shock, not understanding what this really means for him and perhaps your future children and so on. I hope he will cool down, apologise and you'll figure this out.", "NTA. I wasn't aware prior to this post about how dwarfism is passed down but you said you included that in the brief you gave him so the only valid potential concern was already addressed before his comments. All that's left from there is ableism/ bigotry unfortunately. \n\nSure, it might be surprising to hear, but accusing you of deception and saying it's causing doubts for him? Incredibly out of line. \n\nRegardless of what he does from here, I would assume that this is how he really feels and even if he changes his views it will take time for him to unpack his internalised ableism. Time that may include him treating your family poorly without consciously recognising it. I would have serious doubts about continuing this relationship. He's shown you who he is, pay attention", "NTA - You informed him when you felt the time was the right time. And six month was a reasonable time with respect to him. You didn\u2019t married, got pregnant and put him in front of the truth then as a side note. Which he behaves like you did. \n\nHe seems to resent you for \u201cwasting his time\u201d over something he would \u201cwalk away\u201d on the first date, had he knows? If that is the case: Not good. \n\nAlso, little people rocks. So bad on him.", "NTA. But holy hell, how have you been dating for six months and it's never came up. All the conversations you've had about probably the dumbest and smallest shit, and your entire family being little people never made the cut?", "NTA.", "NTA. Imo it can be useful to bring up this sort of thing earlier on as a useful way to filter out the people you don't want a relationship with, but it isn't your *responsibility* to bring it up, it's his responsibility to not be ableist", "NTA, he is a butt.", "NTA. I just don't see how it matters if you aren't carrying the gene.", "The problem could also be that if he wants a future with her he is worried about dwarf children and medical issues? I don't know why else he would be upset.", "Will your kids have dwarfism?", "NAH. It's normal to you. It's your family and you love them. To him it is a genetic trait that is likely to occur if you have kids. Not an unreasonable concern. You two have a lot of talking to do to decide if you want to continue. Good luck.", "NAH - I wouldn't call you an AH, but that is a pretty big bomb to drop on someone as they're preparing to meet your family. But it's also something that's beyond your control now. All you can do is see if he can accept that you only told him now, and go from there. Good luck!", "NTA. But honestly he probably was just spooked because of the genetic implications. You discussed with him that you don\u2019t have the gene so your children would not inherit the gene. \n\nWe can\u2019t expect everyone to be well versed in genetics. And there\u2019s always going to be some misunderstandings and misconceptions. \n\nJust talk to him again. Ask him what went through his mind when you told him. What are his fears surrounding your genes. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t say he\u2019s an asshole because of how he reacted. We take genetic gambles all the time but it\u2019s different when someone has a family history of a genetic mutation that can be seen and discussed with a partner. \n\nHe may have felt like you took away his ability to make an informed decision regarding your relationship and future. And that\u2019s valid giving the fact he likely didn\u2019t know that you two having children would not result in dwarfism. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with people who have dwarfism. But we can\u2019t act like there aren\u2019t issues that come along with these genetic anomalies.

He forced himself to overcome it but it only goes so far as the little people he becomes acclimated around.

My apologies.", "Seriously, who doesn't look at the openly displayed photos of the new person you're dating?", "So obviously he\u2019s TA here, unquestionably. And if the relationship was anything short of marriage consideration, the genetic potential is immaterial. But I would stop short of \u201cif he\u2019s worried about the potential of future children\u201d having dwarfism. I would be slightly concerned about my potential children having a condition that society deems as \u201cother\u201d; life is very difficult for those who suffer from genetic abnormalities, and I wouldn\u2019t want to put my potential children through that. I would marry a partner who had the potential of dwarfism offspring, but I would be hesitant having offspring with them.", "I\u2019m well aware of how genetics work. As I mentioned in another comment, I\u2019m speaking from the bf\u2019s perspective as HE Amy not understand. I have not bothered to update my original post to clarify this point", "yeah but it's a bit soon to discuss the intention of how you would grow that family at 6m. meeting their family and expressing that concern and they said \"oh i don't have the gene\" \"i was planning on doing IVF to screen for the gene\" \"i plan on relying on donor eggs\" or even \"i hope to adopt\"\n\nare all examples of how to bypass the concern and you could still decide if those would work for you. to jump to you should have told me before we got serious (at only 6m) seems a bit extreme even if you are worried.\n\nwhen folks say i want kids, i don't typically ask their particular plans for family planning and i definitely didn't ask my spouse about what he assumed it looked like. when it comes time to start planning a life together it might come up though", "Achondroplasia (the most common cause of dwarfism) is autosomal dominant. No one is a carrier, you either have it or you don't. The most common cause is random genetic mutation, so even if no one in your family has the gene it's possible to have a child affected. Having a child is a risk even if you don't have any known genetic abnormalities.", "But she doesn\u2019t have the gene, so she won\u2019t have offspring with dwarfism, and she explained that to him.", "You literally said she is \"genetically predisposed\" to it. Sounds like you do not, in fact, know how it works. And she explained it. There's no reason to act like this was anything other than the boyfriend doesn't want to be around little people. It's ableist and it's wrong.", "If he can\u2019t be interested in your interests for the sake of the relationship then you\u2019re better off without him", "Ah, for some reason I assumed that dwarfism was an expressed dominant/recessive situation where if she wasn\u2019t a dwarf herself, she still had 25% chance of passing it on. Thanks for the correction.", "This distills it very nicely. He sounds completely self-absorbed. Do not get serious with this person."]}
