He sounds shallow and hurtful and I think you should find someone more kind.", "You have family photos up and he never bothered to take an interest.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned you also wouldn\u2019t have to tell someone you\u2019re the only blonde in a fam of brunettes. You\u2019re dating each other, not the family.\n\nNTA. He reacted poorly.", "His reaction is NOT normal. NTA. Does he legitimately have a problem with little people, or is he concerned that if you were to have kids they would be little people too?\n\nWhat's going on with him? This is weird ableism and should be a red flag about your relationship. But get to the bottom of his reaction.\n\nAlso, how stupid is he. If you have pictures everywhere, how has he not noticed \ud83d\ude44", "Well, you dropped a bit of an info-bomb on him. I honestly think NTA because if it never came up, it never came up. But, at the same time, have you never talked about yourself and your family in 6 months? Has he never shown interest in your family and your photos? Weird. I'd give your bf a couple of days to digest and then see how he responds. Overall, though, it doesn't sound like a lasting relationship. I'd think he'd be more curious than angry or scared if the relationship were to last. But, I don't think that's on you. NTA", "NTA. It is a bit weird that he never looked at the pics of you and your family in all this time. You never did a tour of the flat and said \u201cso this is my pics with my family\u201d? That might be a relatively fast way to find out if anyone is weird about dwarfism, but that\u2019s up to you to say.\n\nAlso, what does he need to get comfortable with? Like, your family isn\u2019t in the mafia or something like that, there\u2019s nothing to get comfortable with beyond asking: \u201cis there anything that bigger people do that I should absolutely avoid when meeting them, besides the obvious (not joking about height, no snow white comments, etc)?\u201d", "NTA - How did this dude not notice any of ur pictures in ur apartment. It seems like he was just unobservant. His whole reaction has a sprinkle ignorance in it.\n\nedit. Nah when rereading again he sounds critically ignorant. He expected smt different but then blamed you when it wasn't to his expectations.", "NTA\n\nI would ask him to tell you how this changes the seriousness of the relationship for him. I think his answer will show you who he is.", "NTA - at first I was like \"wtf, why on earth would he care?\" and the only thing I can think of is that he has the misconception that that means it's likely to be passed on to your kids. You might want to ask him that, and clarify that that's not actually the case. Otherwise, I have no idea why he would freak out about it. \n\nBut you're NTA anyways, because you're not responsible for his misconceptions. If it didn't come up naturally, there was no need to bring it up earlier. Doing it before he met your parents was appropriate, which you did.", "1000% NTA!\n\nThe most concerning part of it all is his accusation that you \"hid\" this information, which implies that he thinks dwarfism is shameful, embarrassing, or otherwise unsavory. Dwarfism is simply a characteristic that most of your family shares, and it sounds like you were just priming your boyfriend with key info about your family before he met them. That's a totally normal thing to do and could be about anything - political identity or personal beliefs, physical characteristics or abilities, income level, etc.\n\nSome people are suggesting that he may be thinking (and making assumptions) about how this affects your potential future as parents. If that's the case, he should ask you. Also, there shouldn't be a moral obligation to share information about one's personal reproductive abilities/genetics unless it's during a serious conversation about intentions or plans to raise children together.\n\nThis seems like a huge red flag to me, but you know him best, and if you feel inclined to give him a chance to rectify things, maybe you could offer an opportunity for him to ask questions about dwarfism in a judgement-free zone. Many ppl don't have much personal experience with folks with dwarfism and his poor reaction may represent his ignorance more than his core beliefs about the condition. You definitely shouldn't do this at the expense of you or your family's dignity, and you certainly deserve an apology from him.", "You did nothing wrong, but wow, (ex?) BF sure did, what an ass.\n\nYou did not \u201cfuck up,\u201d you did not \u201chide\u201d anything, you didn\u2019t try to \u201ctrick\u201d him and his reaction is not \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nThis is no different than if you were the only sighted, hearing, different skin-toned one in your family. \n\nHe did however show you who he really is and the bullet you will be dodging when you move on. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI suppose his reaction was caused by shock, not understanding what this really means for him and perhaps your future children and so on. I hope he will cool down, apologise and you'll figure this out.", "NTA. I wasn't aware prior to this post about how dwarfism is passed down but you said you included that in the brief you gave him so the only valid potential concern was already addressed before his comments. All that's left from there is ableism/ bigotry unfortunately. \n\nSure, it might be surprising to hear, but accusing you of deception and saying it's causing doubts for him? Incredibly out of line. \n\nRegardless of what he does from here, I would assume that this is how he really feels and even if he changes his views it will take time for him to unpack his internalised ableism. Time that may include him treating your family poorly without consciously recognising it. I would have serious doubts about continuing this relationship. He's shown you who he is, pay attention", "NTA - you informed him when you felt the time was the right time. And six month was a reasonable time with respect to him. You didn\u2019t married, got pregnant and put him in front of the truth then as a side note. Which he behave like you did. \n\nHe seems to resent you for \u201cwasting his time\u201d over something he would \u201cwalk away\u201d on the first date, had he knows? If that is the case: Not good. \n\nAlso, little people rocks. So bad on him.", "NTA. But holy hell, how have you been dating for six months and it's never came up. All the conversations you've had about probably the dumbest and smallest shit, and your entire family being little people never made the cut?", "NTA.", "NTA. Imo it can be useful to bring up this sort of thing earlier on as a useful way to filter out the people you don't want a relationship with, but it isn't your *responsibility* to bring it up, it's his responsibility to not be ableist", "NTA, he is a butt.", "NTA. I just don't see how it matters if you aren't carrying the gene.", "The problem could also be that if he wants a future with her he is worried about dwarf children and medical issues? I don't know why else he would be upset.", "Will your kids have dwarfism?", "NAH. It's normal to you. It's your family and you love them. To him it is a genetic trait that is likely to occur if you have kids. Not an unreasonable concern. You two have a lot of talking to do to decide if you want to continue. Good luck.", "NAH - I wouldn't call you an AH, but that is a pretty big bomb to drop on someone as they're preparing to meet your family. But it's also something that's beyond your control now. All you can do is see if he can accept that you only told him now, and go from there. Good luck!", "NTA. But honestly he probably was just spooked because of the generic implications. You discussed with him that you don\u2019t have the gene so your children would not inherit the gene. \n\nWe can\u2019t expect everyone to be well versed in genetics. And there\u2019s always going to be some misunderstandings and misconceptions. \n\nJust talk to him again. Ask him what went through his mind when you told him. What are his fears surrounding your genes. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t say he\u2019s an asshole because of how he reacted. We take genetic gambles all the time but it\u2019s different when someone has a family history of a genetic mutation that can be seen and discussed with a partner. \n\nHe may have felt like you took away his ability to make an informed decision regarding your relationship and future. And that\u2019s valid giving the fact he likely didn\u2019t know that you two having children would not result in dwarfism. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with people who have dwarfism. But we can\u2019t act like there aren\u2019t issues that come along with these generic anomalies.

He forced himself to overcome it but it only goes so far as the little people he becomes acclimated around.

Wtaf", "Eh, I\u2019ve been to many friends and significant others places without examining a single photo on the wall. \n\nI don\u2019t know who those people are so I typically don\u2019t bother looking. \n\nI know this may come as a shock, but men in general aren\u2019t known for being super observant. I think that\u2019s why they miss when their wife gets her hair done or is wearing a new outfit. \n\nI mean male patter unobservance it\u2019s a trope at this point. \n\nAlso, photos of little people do not necessarily induce the same anxiety in the phobic as the actual presence of a little person. Unfortunately, phobias do not always manifest the same in people.", "I used to do this when meeting new people. As a young person coming out of the closet I lost so many friends that I figured if they would have an issue with it then I\u2019d know immediately and wouldn\u2019t have to deal with heartbreak of finding they were bigotted. \n It was only when speaking to an Estate Agent about renting a new house when I was  much older that I realised how much things had changed. She just asked \u201cSo?\u201d , but the look on her face was a very clear \u201cWhat? You want a bloody medal or something?\u201d.", "HEEEE may not know / understand that. I generally think any familial genetic issues should be disclosed if you are dating seriously\u2026", "While IIII know how it works the bf MAY NOT KNOW. I will update to make sure I\u2019m clear that I\u2019m stating from the bf\u2019s perspective.", "We don't really do hobbies together as our interests are wildly different, I for instance love fashion and am studying fashion design and go to fashion shows etc as I want to one day make a brand inclusive for all body types it comes from the fact my Mum taught me and my siblings how to alter clothes which for them is a necessity sadly and I just always loved it, he meanwhile has no interest in fashion and gets bored whenever the conversation turns that way and doesn't want to go to the shows with me as he favours sports and going out drinking which I don't do and i'm not a fan of sports so we kind of do our own things as far as interests go. As for dates we take turns on deciding what to do.", "Actually when you are going to build a life with kids together. Yes they are. People deserve to know what they are getting into potentially. Here that is nothing. However if it were something he does have the right to know absolutely. \n\nI mean unless you\u2019re okay with just playing Russian roulette and birthing kids into the world that could you know have horrible low quality lives due to medical issues when it could have been avoided with a simple conversation. And that\u2019s selfish to do so because who wants to have that kind of life; and I\u2019m speaking for the offspring. Not the parents who have to endure seeing their kid go through hell. No one kid nor parent wants to go through that. \n\nThat\u2019s not going to happen with this young lady. But the point stands. It\u2019s already a crap shoot. Not everyone wants to deliberately up the probability of always drowning in medical bills because of biology.", "So he's basically suffering due to his own chosen ignorance. He could have had compassionate conversations about this with OP the entire time they've known each other, and chose not to ever even ask after her family to begin with? \n\nNTA OP. I am sorry you are suffering due to this guy's self centered myopia. You deserve way better", "It was included in the information I gave him when I sat down to explain everything to him but you're right everyone does have preconceived notions for things outside of their normal.", "She can't pass it on dude", "It was included in the rundown I gave him as I could understand that being a worry to someone not used to the idea of dwarfism even though I get annoyed by people thinking that dwarfism in children is a death sentence.", "That's my bad I should have included far more information in the post which I didn't think about adding until people asked questions.", "That's disgusting honestly", "He could ask his girlfriend and talk about his concerns if that's how he feels. But he's throwing a giant hissy fit instead?", "Another question then:\n\nYour interest in fashion is derived from a need to make a big world fit a little person and has evolved into a passion that you want to make clothes for all body types. (Which I highly commend, nothing fits me either) \n\nThat passion would be in every conversation you have with the BF.  On a first date, \u201cI want to be a fashion designer because\u2026.\u201d  Every offhand comment or story about that time when reaching the top shelf had a hilarious outcome, or that time when someone stared, or that time when Mom was frustrated about not being able to find a nice dress, etc, etc. And then there are the photos everywhere. \n\nAnd BF never noticed?  He\u2019s \u201cshocked that you hid this from him?\u201d  \n\nHow?", "She can't pass it on, she doesn't have the gene. Why even speak up if you know and acknowledge that your comment is already off topic? Disgusting display of ableism", "If he knows it won't affect future children then I am at a loss as to what the possible issue could be. The normal reaction would be something along the lines of \"wow, I was not expecting that. Okay let's go meet them\" if he knows it's just about your family.", "I don\u2019t doubt you trying to educate him, but he has to be willing to receive that information. \n\nI honestly think this is a great learning opportunity for you and him. Hopefully, you have a better idea of how to inform any future partners. And if he sticks around, he will be able to get rid of his prejudices.", "NTA", "No problem, I'm just explaining that a lot of what they raised wasn't part of my original judgement. You're fine OP. Have a good day!", "It's why i'm so confused, I never outright said \"My family all have dwarfism\" but i've talked about difficulties my sister had finding a wedding dress that fit her, how my Mum stayed up all night tailoring my Brothers suit for Prom. Hell i've even made jokes about how my back hurts thinking about all the reaching i'll be doing when we visit my family as i'm the tallest...i'm 5'2\" I don't know how it slipped past him in addition to the pictures or if it was wilful ignorance. \n\nI had the sit down conversation when we were going to meet my family so he could get any questions out of the way as he'd never asked any plus to be a \"Hey *everyone* but me has it just FYI.\"", "As much as I dont like it my boss has an irrational fear of little people. She comes unglued the same way I do around snakes. She cant explain it, they just creep her out. Perhaps he feels the same way? I mean we could sit here and debate the morality, psychology, wrongness of it all. But its unfortunately a reality. I dont get why people are afraid of clowns either. But if its not about future children then maybe its about how he feels being around a whole family of little people. Especially if he hasnt been around any before. This would make me sad if I was OP. Heck the possibility of it makes me sad as it is.", "Because he thinks she deliberately left out this information. Information that would have directly affected his decision to date her.  So now he\u2019s probably thinking what else is she not telling me. \n\nBecause apparently he doesn\u2019t pay close enough attention when she talks. \n\nI get being caught off guard. But I don\u2019t think it has everything to do with the information just him feeling slighted about WHEN the explicit information was given up. \n\nShe has had conversations with him that implied it.", "I think you just answered your own question here. \n\nHint: It didn\u2019t slip past him and it\u2019s not willful ignorance.\n\nHe\u2019s just not that interested in anything outside of his own little bubble and when confronted with something \u201cdifferent\u201d blames you for it. That\u2019s a huge \ud83d\udea9and a preview of how he will respond in the future.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think it slip by him; he just has a blindfold at this point and earplugs. Because those are major conversations point that wouldn\u2019t have gone unnoticed would he have been a little interested in you. \n\nAlso he might not be into fashion but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t support you emotionally in your journey and show interest if things go well for you in your passion. My SO doesn\u2019t know shit about animation and I don\u2019t know squat about advanced development, but we still shoulder each other in what we do and enquire news of each other work and support each other. \n\nEspecially in the field you are aiming at which is extremely hard, you need to know that he support you in your journey so you don\u2019t feel like your paddling alone.", "I'm sorry, that must have been shocking and a little heartbreaking to make space to have those conversations thinking he already knew and was maybe trying not to ask the wrong questions only to learn he actually just wasn't paying attention at all\n\nFwiw you definitely didn't do anything wrong. A good partner would have been paying attention and would have been interested in knowing more / not found that conversation surprising since you didn't keep it a secret at all.", "That wouldn\u2019t make a person automatically assume dwarfism. I had a friend who was 4\u201d11. And an aunt that same height. They aren\u2019t dwarfs. They are just very short. He could have just thought they were short. You\u2019re only 5\u20192. It\u2019s not hard to think that the others just may be 4\u201911 5\u20190 5\u20191 Which would make it difficult to do all of the things you named. \n\nYour back hurting quip could have been misconstrued as you just being comical about being the tallest at 5\u20192. \n\nUnless you specially mentioned height in these scenarios he could have really just not got the memo lol. \n\nThe picture thing. As a person who just doesn\u2019t go around folks houses looking at their pictures. That\u2019s easy to miss. I can think of numerous folks houses I\u2019ve been to countless times and I can\u2019t even remember if they even had up pictures \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. \n\nIf you mentioned anything close to height then he\u2019s just self absorbed and needs to be released back in to the wild \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "You're talking about Achondroplasiaphobia, yeah sadly that's a thing i've seen people react with when they see my family and it's always heartbreaking. he didn't give any indication that was the issue but maybe he didn't want to say it.", "Does your boss know that she's severely ableist lol", "Absolutely this.", "Record scratch\u2026..\n\nWHAT?!?\n\nThis makes me irrationally angry.", "There is such a phobia? I knew there was biases and discrimination toward little people but not an actual phobia of them. Humans, I swear. \n\nSorry you and your family got to experience that.", "Or maybe he didnt realize it until this happened. The state I live in does not have very many little people (that I know of) and its something I overhear spoken of in ignorance or fear for lack of exposure. I agree that he probably should have noticed from the family photos. Expecially if there is a significant height difference between you and the rest of your family. At the same time its also kind of a prominent thing in your family and I can see how he would feel blindsided that no where in 6 months of getting to know each other that it came up in conversation.", "I used to feel that way about it too but it really isn't their fault even if it's upsetting.", "Yeah it's a phobia and it ranges from mild discomfort/distress to outright terror. I try to not think too badly of them because they literally cannot help it and most of the times they're mortified by their own reaction but it's still really upsetting.", "You're a very compassionate human, OP. You'll find your person.", "Well at least they are mortified. That show a bit of compassion (?) not that it make it better. And I know phobia are not logical, sadly. I got mine too. But here is the kick, I treat them.\n\nHowever phobia or not, is you boyfriend mortified of his reaction? I feel that is a major point to nail."]}
