I'm not in a great place, so my therapist said to avoid triggering situations for the evening & just relax. Step 1 was to have a walk home through a nature-heavy pathway in the sun. Simple.\n\nAs I leave the therapy building, I send my mum a message saying that we overran a little, but I was on my way home. We'd already agreed that I was going to walk back.\n\nShe then asked me to send her my location. When I asked why, she told me so that she could pick me up. I asked if there was something serious or urgent, but she said no, & that she had just gotten my sister from the childminders & could pick me up.\n\nAppreciating the gesture, I said thanks, but I really wanted the walk.\n\n20 minutes later, I get texts saying \"where are you?\". When I said I was walking home as planned, she called me a d1ck.\n\nI then receive voice notes from her, encouraging my sister to play this weird game of cat & mouse, sing-songing that they were going to \"find me\". I tried to remain firm but polite, saying that I really didn't want picking up. \n\nMy mum is consistently like this, acting like everything is a game & refusing to respect any boundaries she doesn't like. She says she'd never force her kids to hug someone they didn't want to, but will gladly poke, prod, grab & stick her finger in your ear because \"I'm your mother, I can touch you if I want.\" She'll try & \"play a game\" with you, putting on a baby voice & everything, & if you ever tell her \"no\" or don't join in, the harrassment & insults start.\n\nNow on a straight, hidden path, I relaxed, thinking I'd been able to evade them. It wasn't until yet another 10 minutes later where I received a messaged saying \"see you\". \n\nI knew I wasn't in danger, but my blood still ran cold & I began to feel panicked.\n\nI soon saw my mum & sister sat on a bench up ahead, laughing. She'd apparently predicted the route I was taking, parked her car nearby, then walked until she could reach a point where she could intercept me.\n\nI got unimaginably angry. As I got closer & closer, I had all of these feelings, built up over years, that I just wanted to scream in her face. \n\nHowever, as my little sister was there too, I didn't. Not only would it be inappropriate to start that argument in front of her, but I also knew that if I tried to communicate whilst angry, I'd say something cruel just to make her hurt in the way she hurts me sometimes, & I didn't want to do that.\n\nSo, as I walked past, I simply said \"I hope you're proud of yourself\" & kept on walking without looking back.\n\nOnce I got back home, my sister snuck into my room to apologise. I said that it's not her fault in the slightest, & I'm sorry if she thought I was mad at her. She then told me that my mum had said that I wouldn't be getting dropped off at therapy again if that's my attitude, & I said that's totally fine.\n\nMy mum didn't really speak to me for the rest of the evening, but honestly, I far preferred that over an argument.", "created_utc": 1689852193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154o7fw/aita_for_walking_away/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even your sister is more mature than her and apologized. You did extremely well to walk away, I'm proud of you and so is your therapist, I'm sure. Can you move out and stay with friends or family? I think as long as you stay in this situation, it will be hard to recover from this abuse.", "The only way you could be the ah in this situation is if you'd let your sister feel upset about what happened. You didn't do that, in fact you both communicated with each other in a very healthy and rational way. If your mother can't accept the consequences of ignoring boundaries that's her problem. NTA", "NTA, time to come up with the \"x reasons you would be a terrible psychologist\" game: whenever she interferes with your therapy goals, you add another reason. Then you read the whole list and say \"that's x reasons now, let's see if we can make it to 50!\" \n\n\"You mask your abusive behavior under the guise of a game\" is reason number 1.", "YTA. Your mom was being playful and you saw it as abusive. Very confusing dynamic.", "NTA- your mom is the big time.", "My therapist gave me a check-in call after the fact, & she honestly agreed with you \ud83d\ude05. I hate it, because she's not a bad mum. When I am in the mood to mess around & laugh, she's great fun. She's just not great from a support standpoint", "I have considered that possibility before, but I always freak out & deny it before the idea could settle. I'm terrified of criticising her, but I guess that kinda just goes to prove the point more, huh \ud83d\ude05", "It amuses me sometimes, because my little sister is on the autistic spectrum. Yet, somehow, her ability to pick up on social cues & other people's feelings are stronger than anyone else in my household \ud83d\ude05 (I'm ADHD, so we bond over how stressful sound is lmao)", "That's not playful. Thats ignoring boundaries and forcing herself on her child. And putting herself over her child.", "I do think I could've communicated a little better, but it's more the fact that she followed me.

Your mom is consistent in ignoring boundaries, and while it's wrong, it shouldn't cause this much of a reaction. \n\nI highly recommend you get your mom to come to a therapy session with you and discuss boundaries.", "Or she's just entitled.", "This mother is clearly bullying her kid.", "Funny you think boundaries are good but think mom is the good guy when she doesn\u2019t respect them", "Or maybe she's just trying to engage with her child the best she can. Not everyone is perfect.", "I never said mom was the good guy, just not an asshole for being playful in this instance. She needs a lesson on boundaries.

She would provoke me too, infantilize me, and treat me like her personal property. She is provoking you on purpose and knows exactly what she is doing.

She will continue to erode at you until you either snap, or completely collapse into dust. \n\nNTA. Your mom is vile.", "NTA.  When I was your age, I had a similar sort of relationship with my mom.  Over the years (and with a lot of therapy) I have put up boundaries that make her angry and threaten cutting me out of her life.  She hasn't yet, though, and I'm emotionally safer and generally happier with the boundaries, even with the emotional punishment and guilt.\n\nGood luck.  It's difficult loving someone who doesn't respect you.  It's painful sometimes.

I hate talking down about her like this, because she's not \"abusive\" or a \"bad parent\". I love her, & 60% of the time, we're chill. It's just that 40% where things range from tense to bad to worse.\n\nI agree with some commenters that have said it sounds like therapy has helped me. I want to get to a point where I can speak to her about the ways she hurts me sometimes, & not immediately back down & shrivel when she starts insulting & gaslighting me.", "I would never want my sister thinking that. Because of her behavioural & emotional difficulties, my sister probably gets the most flack from my mum out of the 4 of us. Whenever anything goes missing or wrong, my mum's immediate reaction is to question whether my sister did it.\n\nThat's why I try to interject with the way she speaks to my little siblings. I don't want her turning more kids into me", "> she's not a bad mum.\n\nYou will probably realise over time that she... is a bad mum. \n\nShe's controlling, stomps boundaries, and enjoys putting you in uncomfortable positions because it makes her feel powerful. \n\nPeople like this struggle to be nurturing parents. Their love tends to be conditional on you never ever standing up to them or having your own desires.\n\nEven a simple desire to walk home instead of getting the car wasn't accepted - it had to be turned into a fight. That's supremely irrational and unreasonable.", "Nah she caused you trauma.", "That sub helped me open my eyes OP and it could do you a lot of good to check it out.", "> because she's not \"abusive\" or a \"bad parent\".  \n\n> when she starts insulting & gaslighting me.\n\nI'm sorry but she absolutely is abusive and a bad parent if she does either of those things.", "It's genetic. Don't know you are getting down voted.  Women are more likely to get missed and not diagnosed.", "She pokes her finger in your ear? That's just...yuck.", "Because what I said sounded mean, and people are to dumb to actually understand anything logical like genetics", "Yeah, she's done that a couple of times. She likes to \"preen\" a lot. She'll pinch at my face & stick her finger in my ear, & only once I ask her what's she's doing, she'll say \"there's dirt/a hair\" etc", "No, I see where they're coming from. Part of my therapy is about emotional regulation & self soothing. I've always wanted to do better by her, but it hurts when she doesn't seem to share that sentiment. She's very strong-minded, & doesn't take \"being wrong\" very well.\n\nIf I invited her to therapy about her boundaries, it would be a shit show \ud83d\ude05. I'd be \"accusing her of being a bad mother\", when she \"had it way worse growing up\", & (& I quote) \"you wouldn't be so depressed if you had gone to Uni. Oh wait! You couldn't even go if you wanted to, because you flunked your A-levels.\"", "Hi mom!", "Of all the times and moments to engage with a 19 year old, it is this one time he says no. To. TAKE. TIME. FOR. HIMSELF. \n\n\nIs there a war in their house that No Other Time works? \n\n\nGet over yourself.", "I agree with this. Part of why I posted is that I knew, in isolation, this looks like an overreaction, & I'll willingly admit that I struggle with my emotions (hence the therapy lmao) & my mum was, in her own way, trying to be playful.\n\nOur communication isn't & has never been great, ever since I was little. I would love to build a healthier relationship with her, but she doesn't do \"being wrong\" (a lot of her issues are a result of trauma herself. She tried therapy when she was younger, but brushed it off because she didn't like being vulnerable like that)", "I'm with you 100%. I know the feeling. I hope you find a way to communicate with her better and for her to respect your boundaries."]}
