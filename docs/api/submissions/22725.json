I'm not in a great place, so my therapist said to avoid triggering situations for the evening & just relax. Step 1 was to have a walk home through a nature-heavy pathway in the sun. Simple.\n\nAs I leave the therapy building, I send my mum a message saying that we overran a little, but I was on my way home. We'd already agreed that I was going to walk back.\n\nShe then asked me to send her my location. When I asked why, she told me so that she could pick me up. I asked if there was something serious or urgent, but she said no, & that she had just gotten my sister from the childminders & could pick me up.\n\nAppreciating the gesture, I said thanks, but I really wanted the walk.\n\n20 minutes later, I get texts saying \"where are you?\". When I said I was walking home as planned, she called me a d1ck.\n\nI then receive voice notes from her, encouraging my sister to play this weird game of cat & mouse, sing-songing that they were going to \"find me\". I tried to remain firm but polite, saying that I really didn't want picking up. \n\nMy mum is consistently like this, acting like everything is a game & refusing to respect any boundaries she doesn't like. She says she'd never force her kids to hug someone they didn't want to, but will gladly poke, prod, grab & stick her finger in your ear because \"I'm your mother, I can touch you if I want.\" She'll try & \"play a game\" with you, putting on a baby voice & everything, & if you ever tell her \"no\" or don't join in, the harrassment & insults start.\n\nNow on a straight, hidden path, I relaxed, thinking I'd been able to evade them. It wasn't until yet another 10 minutes later where I received a messaged saying \"see you\". \n\nI knew I wasn't in danger, but my blood still ran cold & I began to feel panicked.\n\nI soon saw my mum & sister sat on a bench up ahead, laughing. She'd apparently predicted the route I was taking, parked her car nearby, then walked until she could reach a point where she could intercept me.\n\nI got unimaginably angry. As I got closer & closer, I had all of these feelings, built up over years, that I just wanted to scream in her face. \n\nHowever, as my little sister was there too, I didn't. Not only would it be inappropriate to start that argument in front of her, but I also knew that if I tried to communicate whilst angry, I'd say something cruel just to make her hurt in the way she hurts me sometimes, & I didn't want to do that.\n\nSo, as I walked past, I simply said \"I hope you're proud of yourself\" & kept on walking without looking back.\n\nOnce I got back home, my sister snuck into my room to apologise. I said that it's not her fault in the slightest, & I'm sorry if she thought I was mad at her. She then told me that my mum had said that I wouldn't be getting dropped off at therapy again if that's my attitude, & I said that's totally fine.\n\nMy mum didn't really speak to me for the rest of the evening, but honestly, I far preferred that over an argument.", "created_utc": 1689852193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154o7fw/aita_for_walking_away/", "score": 441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She does this with both me & my 3 younger siblings, as well as my dad. She'll poke & prod & make fun, & if you go quiet or get upset, she finds it hilarious. So she'll keep doing it until you get angry, to which point the \"Jesus! Alright, calm your tits, I was just making a joke. Why do you have to be so dramatic?\"\n\nFor example, my dad didn't grow up in a great household, & was often bullied by his older siblings. My mum is aware of this, & often uses those situations to crack jokes at his expense. My dad will try to jokingly go \"way to bring up my trauma for a joke; it makes me feel fantastic.\" To which, again, the cycle repeats: your discomfort is hilarious, & when you end up snapping, she tells you to \"not be such a pussy\"", "You're blaming yourself for poor communication when the fact of the matter is that she was choosing to ignore what you were saying. I am 39 and I still struggle with this. I tend to say the same thing in different ways repeatedly because I thought the issue was me not explaining myself well and not being understood because of me not wording my feelings properly. Nope, the issue was that my parents didn't listen to me, didn't care how I felt, and didn't care what I had to say. That's the issue here too. \n\nIt's not your fault. Stop doubting yourself, you are not the problem here.", "That's the way I kinda see it. As a person? I absolutely adore her. We actually quite often go to the movies, hang out, etc. But I was an accidental pregnancy when she was quite young, so I don't think she quite got the chance to mature enough into an \"efficient parental figure\". There are times in my life when I've needed a *mum*, & she's not had the skills to cope with that", "After seeing a few people saying that it sounds like narcissistic traits, I've looked into it a little more. I really felt the \"They're fun, exciting, kind & generous until you won't do what they want\", as well as the \"insults in the form of jokes\". I'm queer, & as much as she is 100% \"accepting\", she also makes homophobic & sexist jokes to my face, accentuating the \"You're being so dramatic.

She tends to mirror her favourite TV characters & friends as a means of interacting quote-unquote \"normally\". She's extremely emotive, affectionate & enthusiastic, but obviously, that can sometimes lead to the accidental overstepping of people's boundaries & personal space (which is again, funny, because she's significantly better at acknowledging when she's overstepped boundaries & taking accountability than my mum is).\n\nThanks for the input, by the way! I'm always trying to find ways to better understand her brilliant little brain \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that!! I\u2019m also queer so I know the struggles of living with a narcissistic parent (father) and dealing with that shit. You deserve better. The housing crisis sucks in the US as well so I\u2019m really sorry. Do you have friends you could get a place with or family to move in with? I hope you can bring this up to your therapist as narcissistic abuse can be overwhelming if not treated. Wishing you the best!\n\nAlso: you should look up the grey rocking method. It\u2019s a way to deal with narcissists. It\u2019s basically showing no emotion, no responses, no questions to what they\u2019re doing or saying.

You're not ever meant to excuse this sort of behaviour from her, but I understand why it's tempting. \n\nNot respecting your own childs boundaries about such simple things makes me suspect she would interfere with way more stuff if she could.

He just jots it down to it being her sense of humour, & that she doesn't really mean it. I do tend to confide in him more often than her about my emotions, because I actually feel better after talking to him. My mental health & feelings have actually caused arguments between them before, which is why I've tried to hide a lot of it. I don't want to put my little siblings through the stress of a divorce. I'd rather just \"3rd parent\" as much as I physically can.\n\n(Sidenote: writing this made me realise that this actually frustrates my mum quite a bit.

Doesn't that behaviour seem abusive and a bit toxic?", "I'm so sorry OP, and from the viewpoint of your siblings, they're so lucky to have you. \n\nHowever, there's a weird understanding that older siblings just end up taking care of siblings and being the 3rd parent. I'm both glad that you give them positive experiences and seem to be an adult they can trust on top of being their sibling - But honestly, it shouldn't have to be like that. I'm guessing you've taken on the role as co-parent for a few years, and considering no one would allow a 16-18 year old to adopt a child, so why would you be put in charge of them? \n\nI hope I'm managing to succesfully (albeit a bit awkwardly) convey that I see both positives and negatives, but ultimately it wasn't relevant. You have your own struggles and things to deal with, and being their confidants is going to drain you and I wish I could give any suggestions as to how to help, but I'm from denmark so my knowledge is limited. \n\nI can see how it would be frustrating to her though. I understand and respect how you love her, and that things are nuanced, so for me to dunk on her might come off as if I'm saying you're wrong in feeling conflicted.\n\nHowever, the reason why I could see it being frustrating, is because she is watching her attempts to control and literally *bully* everyone, and now that your brother is getting older, she realizes it might not stick. That if he keeps his relationship with you strong, he might not ever stop being \"angsty\" as you said he was. \n\nI believe he IS angsty though, all teens are, but growing up in the enviroment you've described is going to make that angst skyrocket - Understandably so to be honest. \n\nI cannot stress enough that you are not in the wrong. What you've described in the thread sounds stressful. And being your mother doesn't excuse her crossing your boundaries several times and hiding behind \"jokes\" when really she sounds extremely hostile. If a stranger treated you like she does when it comes to physically invading your space, everyone would be saying it technically qualifies as assault. Being related doesn't change that. You're allowed to say no, it's one of the first words we learn for a reason after all. \n\nAlso I haven't read all the comments, but I'm pessimistic and feel like this is a situation where someone in the comments will jump to her defense. \n\nWhat she is doing isn't okay, and you shouldn't listen to anyone trying to excuse behaviours that are causing you to feel fearful at the thought of her approach. \n\nThat was longwinded but I'm only 10 years older than you, but I can see so much of my own \"excuses\" as to why a family dynamic might be off and in retrospect, I shouldn't have felt so bad for feeling the way I did and I hope you don't either. \n\nI wish you luck, OP!", "Sorry mate :( I hope one day you are in a position where you can leave and make a better home situaiton for yourself <3", "That is the way I tried to rationalise my own feelings in my head: \"if a friend had followed me on my way back from therapy despite me saying I wanted some alone time, I'd be severely creeped out & irritated\".\n\nBut whenever I express this to her, she goes back to \"I'm your mother\". That's the excuse, every time. She can because she's my mum, & she gave birth to me, & she raised me, & I live under her roof, therefore I follow her rules.\n\nI do think it's something I have to unlearn; my therapist has pointed out my reliance on the opinions of others to structure my reality, as I've always been made to question & doubt my own judgement", "This was really lovely to read.
