I'm not in a great place, so my therapist said to avoid triggering situations for the evening & just relax. Step 1 was to have a walk home through a nature-heavy pathway in the sun. Simple.\n\nAs I leave the therapy building, I send my mum a message saying that we overran a little, but I was on my way home. We'd already agreed that I was going to walk back.\n\nShe then asked me to send her my location. When I asked why, she told me so that she could pick me up. I asked if there was something serious or urgent, but she said no, & that she had just gotten my sister from the childminders & could pick me up.\n\nAppreciating the gesture, I said thanks, but I really wanted the walk.\n\n20 minutes later, I get texts saying \"where are you?\". When I said I was walking home as planned, she called me a d1ck.\n\nI then receive voice notes from her, encouraging my sister to play this weird game of cat & mouse, sing-songing that they were going to \"find me\". I tried to remain firm but polite, saying that I really didn't want picking up. \n\nMy mum is consistently like this, acting like everything is a game & refusing to respect any boundaries she doesn't like. She says she'd never force her kids to hug someone they didn't want to, but will gladly poke, prod, grab & stick her finger in your ear because \"I'm your mother, I can touch you if I want.\" She'll try & \"play a game\" with you, putting on a baby voice & everything, & if you ever tell her \"no\" or don't join in, the harrassment & insults start.\n\nNow on a straight, hidden path, I relaxed, thinking I'd been able to evade them. It wasn't until yet another 10 minutes later where I received a messaged saying \"see you\". \n\nI knew I wasn't in danger, but my blood still ran cold & I began to feel panicked.\n\nI soon saw my mum & sister sat on a bench up ahead, laughing. She'd apparently predicted the route I was taking, parked her car nearby, then walked until she could reach a point where she could intercept me.\n\nI got unimaginably angry. As I got closer & closer, I had all of these feelings, built up over years, that I just wanted to scream in her face. \n\nHowever, as my little sister was there too, I didn't. Not only would it be inappropriate to start that argument in front of her, but I also knew that if I tried to communicate whilst angry, I'd say something cruel just to make her hurt in the way she hurts me sometimes, & I didn't want to do that.\n\nSo, as I walked past, I simply said \"I hope you're proud of yourself\" & kept on walking without looking back.\n\nOnce I got back home, my sister snuck into my room to apologise. I said that it's not her fault in the slightest, & I'm sorry if she thought I was mad at her. She then told me that my mum had said that I wouldn't be getting dropped off at therapy again if that's my attitude, & I said that's totally fine.\n\nMy mum didn't really speak to me for the rest of the evening, but honestly, I far preferred that over an argument.", "created_utc": 1689852193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154o7fw/aita_for_walking_away/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mum sounds like part of the reason you are in therapy in the first place. You should be so proud of yourself for holding in your outburst in front your sister.

Your mum sounds very immature and disrespectful. I would have reacted the same way, and tbh you handled yourself really well. I can imagine the temptation to explode in anger. Sorry but your mum sounds so annoying. That was sweet of your sister to apologise thank goodness she\u2019s not taking after your mum.", "NTA. I can see why you're in therapy. Plus saying she wouldn't take you to therapy unless you fix your attitude is horrible.", "NTA. I mean I guess we know why you\u2019re in therapy.

She needs work on improving her vocabulary.", "Isn't it wonderful when a mother like yours (and mine) chooses to \"punish\" you by ignoring you and you can have a day or two of peace and quiet?

Even your sister is more mature than her and apologized. You did extremely well to walk away, I'm proud of you and so is your therapist, I'm sure. Can you move out and stay with friends or family? I think as long as you stay in this situation, it will be hard to recover from this abuse.", "The only way you could be the ah in this situation is if you'd let your sister feel upset about what happened. You didn't do that, in fact you both communicated with each other in a very healthy and rational way. If your mother can't accept the consequences of ignoring boundaries that's her problem. NTA", "NTA, time to come up with the \"x reasons you would be a terrible psychologist\" game: whenever she interferes with your therapy goals, you add another reason. Then you read the whole list and say \"that's x reasons now, let's see if we can make it to 50!\" \n\n\"You mask your abusive behavior under the guise of a game\" is reason number 1.", "YTA. Your mom was being playful and you saw it as abusive. Very confusing dynamic.", "NTA- your mom is the big time.", "My therapist gave me a check-in call after the fact, & she honestly agreed with you \ud83d\ude05. I hate it, because she's not a bad mum.

She's just not great from a support standpoint", "I have considered that possibility before, but I always freak out & deny it before the idea could settle. I'm terrified of criticising her, but I guess that kinda just goes to prove the point more, huh \ud83d\ude05", "It amuses me sometimes, because my little sister is on the autistic spectrum. Yet, somehow, her ability to pick up on social cues & other people's feelings are stronger than anyone else in my household \ud83d\ude05 (I'm ADHD, so we bond over how stressful sound is lmao)", "That's not playful. Thats ignoring boundaries and forcing herself on her child. And putting herself over her child.", "I do think I could've communicated a little better, but it's more the fact that she followed me. I needed some alone time, & I established that, but she still insisted on carrying out \"the joke\"", "No I totally get it, my mum is a fantastic mum, but she can\u2019t recognise when I just need support or when she\u2019s pushing her problems on me.
