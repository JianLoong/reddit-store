She initially tried to give me 800 and tell me that I cover the cost, but I held firm, and she eventually coughed up the full amount.  It was awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nBut here\u2019s my take away. I wish I hadn\u2019t gone through all that and just said no, or even eloped.   It added so much stress.

Definitely NTA and your mother needs to stop interjecting, or this will continue long after your married", "NTA-  What is it with weddings that just encourages people to let their freak flags fly? FFS.\n\nStart with this - Mom- we cannot afford your extra guests. We've been to plenty of weddings where not every last soul was invited or attended, this will be no different.  I appreciate your perspective, but if you want to entertain all those folks, then host a family reunion. I'm not able to do that.\n\nFor what it's worth. Here's how I combatted that issue. We held our wedding on Mark Twain era paddle wheeler boat that hosts dinner parties, weddings, etc.  Per coast guard regulations, maximum capacity of 110 guests (we advertised only 100 to our family) When we were pestered to add more we just told them, can't, coast guard won't let us. For the few that we forgot or needed to add, we had the 10 person buffer and ended up using 8 of these. 25 years later all our friends and family remind us that they remember our unique wedding and the reception that occurred on the boat out on the water better than any other wedding in the family. A good time was had by all. (best part was that the whole thing including band and catering and open bar was right at $10k.)", "To add a few other comments I've seen, I'm just baffled that you gave her the option to invite any extra people at all. You already made up your guest list of all the people you want at your wedding. Why on earth would you let anyone (mom or otherwise) add even more people to the guest list that you don't even know?\n\nLast I checked, the wedding is a special day for the bride and groom, not so much for their parents, parent's friends, or extended family of distant relations.", "INFO: why would you ask your mother for a list of additional guests? In other comments you said, they would only pay some things, so I don\u2019t understand why you would ask at all.", "INFO   Not enough information.  It all depends on who's paying for the entire wedding.  You state she's paying only for part.
