You will be TA if you just grumble and read these feeling justified instead of talking it out and expressing your emotions. Then, based on her reaction, you'll know what she truly thinks of you and the relationship. She might think you didn't care about your birthday. I finally told my husband, hey-- I really do like flowers once in awhile, etc.  He would get me orchids-- I told him you only get me orchids b/c you like them, they're not my thing.  You have to communicate (I know, cliche). Don't expect her to read your mind and don't expect her to automatically know she's being a jerk.

Are there other signs that your fiancee doesn't value you, or that the relationship is one-sided, because this was a HUGE slap in the face.  I would definitely put the wedding on pause and re-evaluate the whole thing and look for other red flags.  She seems EXTREMELY selfish and immature, and I would not want to hitch myself long-term to a person like that.", "I liked the one where a gal bought 4 tickets for her friend group (they all paid, she just bought) and wanted to go there 4 hours early (they lived 45 minutes away from the venue). One friend was working and couldn't be reached at the time OP wanted to leave. So OP picked her friends up and started on the road. Friend called while they had been on the road for 15 minutes and said she was ready to go. OP said no, they're too far along, and sold the ticket (at cost) to OP's sister. OP then wondered why friend was mad as hell and not taking her phone calls.", "You didn't even read the post, did you."]}
