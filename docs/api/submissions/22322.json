Your fiance is clearly in the wrong, and yet you still manage to sound like a petulant child.  \n\nInstead of deciding for yourself that you would celebrate your birthday when you had time to do it properly, you waited for her to celebrate you--hopefully in a way tbat would match your expectations.  Not that you expressed those expectations--you just waited to be served.  And then you whine about her being sweaty, making you eat delicious food, and playing Taylor Swift too much.

I\u2019m guessing that you are still in your 20s so you have nothing but time. \nOne piece of advice I will give you is, don\u2019t keep score. It sounds like you were expecting a meal that was comparable to what you spent on her. Gifts and gestures should not be valued by what was spent on them. It\u2019s the thought and effort that matters most. Sometimes things that cost nothing are the most valuable and time is one of those things. Good luck.", "NTA Dude, don\u2019t marry her.

This behavior is clearly hurtful but they could be genuinely oblivious and just need to be made aware.

My partner of 8 years did something like this on my birthday a few years ago.  It was the middle of the pandemic, but he could have at least made a nice dinner for me and given me a card.  Nada.  I left shortly after for a one week trip to visit family and my partner didn't call me or answer his phone all week.  So when I got home, I told him to start packing his stuff and move out.  He then stepped up to the plate, apologized profusely and has been very attentive for the past 2 years.  But it really took a wake up call for him to realize that if he didn't appreciate me, I wasn't going to stay in the relationship.  The thing is, you can't be bluffing.
