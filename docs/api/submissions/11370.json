On Tuesday, when I opened her bag I found that the snack was in there untouched, so I asked her why. She told me it was too tough for her to open. I asked her about previous weeks and she told me that her teacher used to help her but doesn't anymore. I encouraged her to ask her teacher the next day. \n\nThe next day the snack was still unopened, and when I asked her about it she told me that the teacher told her that she needs to learn to open her snacks at snacktime all by herself. I sent the teacher an email explaining that the snack is quite tough to open (even for adults sometimes) and that it would be super helpful if she could help my daughter open her snack when she is unable to do so, otherwise she has an 8 hour school day with only her lunchtime to eat. I was nice about it - but you better believe it did tick me off a bit that she would rather let a kid go without a snack while all the other kids ate one than help a 5 year old open a snack. \n\nI picked her up on Thurs and she still had an unopened snack. At this point, I called the teacher to ask what was going on and she said that their goal the last few months of Kindergarten is to promote independence and that she can't do that if they have to hold the kids hand at every turn. She said it might help if I sent my kid in with a \"normal\" snack instead of such a \"bizarre, difficult to open\" one. She is VERY aware of my daughter's food intolerances.\n\nAt this point, I politely thanked her and called her principal asking him to move my daughter to a different classroom. I said that it was very inappropriate to emphasize that my daughter's snacks weren't \"normal\" enough, given that she is unable to live a normal life. I wish I could give her some Cheetos or a pack of cookies like the other kids get, but I can't and just wanted my daughter to have something a little bit more fun when all the other kids were eating those things. She moved rooms but her previous teacher sent me a message about how I've really made things difficult over a snack - apparently they've started an investigation and are monitoring the way she interacts with kids. Two of the mom's that she knows better than me commented in the mom's group chat that the way the teacher was being treated in regards to this is \"completely unfair\" and that a child's food issues shouldn't be their teacher's issue to deal with. So, am I the asshole? Should I just have sent in a different snack?\n\nTl; dr: My daughter's teacher wouldn't open her snacks because they weren't \"normal\" enough, so I had her moved to a different classroom.\n\nEdit: Asked a couple times why I can't open the snack before school. For some reason, school policy is that the snack has to be a single serve item in a sealed package. Not sure why! I asked for an exception when I first sent the snack in months ago and was told they don't make exceptions to this rule for one kid because they would have to make it for everyone, but that there would be someone in her classroom willing to help her. Kindergarteners are also not allowed to carry their own scissors - no exceptions.", "created_utc": 1677850924, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11h12tt/aita_for_having_my_daughter_move_classrooms/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, your kid will face worse problems and you went nuclear instead of double down with the teacher or asking the principal to insist she open it. If this is her only issue with this teacher, you went nuclear. Also when she gets a shit teacher for real, your ability to advocate for your kid just decreased. Yta for moving her rather than just having the principal force the issue.", "ESH. They are trying to teach kids how to do these basic life skills in kindergarten but it's also wrong to let a child go hungry over this. I would have just started putting it in Tupperware, their request that individual snacks be in single served packages is just that,  a request. Common sense dictates that if my child can't open it I will just put it in different packaging. I wouldn't have gotten to the point that you did with the teacher bc I would have repackaged the snack but had I and the teacher had been stubborn enough about not opening a snack I would have wanted a new teacher as well.", "NTA\u2026 as a teacher myself, I can\u2019t comprehend why this would even be an issue. Either she\u2019s being spiteful or lazy\u2026 either way, a closer look at her methods and behavior is absolutely warranted.", "INFO: Why can't you open it ahead of time and put it in a container that you daughter can open?", "NTA", "ESH The teacher 100% could have helped your daughter, but I do understand teaching kids independence and the importance of that. You could have also opened it at home and put it in a easier to open bag/ container for your child.", "YTA- you are at fault for treating an overworked teacher that is trying to balance numerous students\u2019 needs but you expect to stop everything to accommodate the \u201creally fun\u201d snack you found for your daughter that fits her dietary needs. You even admit it\u2019s difficult for an adult to open.\n\nI suspect there are \u201cless fun\u201d snacks you can also send. But clearly having \u201creally fun\u201d snacks is a status symbol that more important to you than following the policy of students opening their own snacks. To file a complaint over it is inexcusable and will impact your daughter in future as I know teachers will be requesting not to have your daughter in their class due to your behaviour", "NTA the teacher is being abilist", "INFO: are you not able to make a small snip in the packaging? It would probably be unnoticeable to teachers and would help your child open it easier.", "NTA because they gave you no other options. If they offered a solution with her original teacher you would have accepted that.  You advocated for your daughter as you should.  The teacher should have been more helpful.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you're focusing on your kid's well-being. That should always be your first priority. Switching kindergarten classes isn't a huge deal; if your child's needs aren't being met that's a simple and sane solution.\n\nSide question: is this snack something you could open and repackage at home? Maybe put it in a sandwich bag or Mason jar?\n\nEdit: a Ziploc bag or Mason jar or even a Tupperware container are all packages that \"seal.\" This school policy sounds very odd - are they trying to encourage cookies and chips? What's wrong with apple slices in a baggie, for instance? What's the difference between an Uncrustable and half a PB&J in a sandwich bag?", "YTA- 100% because from your post you think the teacher needs to help every kid open up a snack every day. Get over your fun snack that is making the job harder and do your job as a parent and make it easier on the child", "Provided everything in this post is true, NTA. Also, for the teacher to contact you afterwards and complain about your concerns was really unprofessional. I teach high school students who need help with opening stuff sometimes, or fixing things...and sometimes I ask them for help, too. While I understand the need for teaching independence, I feel like this was a weird hill to die on due to the dietary restrictions. \n\nThis also discourages the little girl from asking for help. What kind of kindergarten teacher wants that for their students?", "If your child is THAT special or that allergic, maybe you should homeschool. If she can't open the snack, than send her with another snack she can. Save the \"fun\" snack for after school when you can help her. Sure, the teacher could help, but it's not their job to potentially get in trouble over. I'd be furious, too, as the teacher, if my job was being scrutinized over opening a 'special' snack for a 'special' child. What's next, considering you did this, and she's not even in 1st grade yet? YTA", "YTA. \n\nIt isn't a teacher's job to open thirty individual snacks during a break period. Occasionally helping a struggling kid isn't a big deal. Doing it every day is too much.\n\nYou are the one sending your child to school with something they can't open. That is on you.\n\nWhat's next? Are you going to send her to school with a can of Campbell's Soup and no way to open it?\n\nYour edit defies credulity. \n\nNo school on the planet requires original packaging because no school on the planet requires prepackaged foods.\n\nIf you can put a handful of grapes or a homemade sandwich in a bag or piece of Tupperware, then you can do the same thing with Dr Bronner's tofu and sawdust chocolate-free chips a-soy cookies.", "As I reading this :  \"I encouraged her to ask her teacher the next day.\", the first thing I though was : why the hell can't you teach your kid to open the damn snack ? She's 5 for God's sakes.\n\nYou're not doing your kid any favors by not teaching her how to be independent. In a few months, she won't have a teacher to help her at all with snacks. She'll have to deal with it on her own.\n\nYTA, and I feel for the next teachers because you're the parent they all fear...", "NTA because their rule about repackaged snacks is dumb.", "Info: Is there any particular reason why you couldn\u2019t open the snack and put it in a ziplock bag or something easier for your daughter to open?", "ESH. Switching class mid year is a huge upheaval in the normal routine for everyone. It seems like working with the teacher to find an acceptable solution and then working with the principal if you couldn\u2019t solve the problem with the teacher would have been better first steps.", "Would the teacher or the mommy princesses who criticized you be willing to assume your child\u2019s hospital bills?", "NTA as the school won't let you repackage it first.\n\nAlso, I hope you've screenshotted the conversation of the mother's moaning and shared that with the principal as that shows teacher has been gossiping (unless you've been telling people?)", "Info - I am dying of curiosity. What is this snack?", "NTA--you really tried to work with the teacher. And the fact that the teacher emailed you about the investigation shows a lack of judgement and that it's unlikely it would have helped to keep working things out. That was extremely inappropriate of her and you should forward it to the school.", "NTA You searched for a solution to your childs problem. It\u00b4s not like you asked them to investigate the teacher. And if someone makes a comment about it you should tell them exactly that.", "YTA\n\nFormer teacher here. \n\nI get why you are frustrated. However you are thinking in parent mode, not looking at this from the perspective of a teacher, who likely has 22 students in the class. The entire reason independence is encouraged is because if the teacher is needed to help a student with every little task, you have to keep in mind that *it's not just your kid*. You  have to multiply that action times 22 kids any time you do *anything*. \n\nKids need to be toilet trained before entering K because not only can the teacher not stop instructing to help one child wipe their butt, they really can't stop the lesson 22 times a day to help 22 kids wipe their butts. They cannot tie 22 pairs of shoes every time it's time to go out to recess because you did not teach your child to tie laces, but hope the teacher will do this. And I know it seems like opening your child's snack is a small thing, but opening 22 snacks at snack time, poking the straws into 22 juice boxes, and then repeating the same thing at lunch,  opening 22 lunch items plus poking the straws into 22 juice boxes... takes up a lot of time! Imagine being the cafeteria monitor and being asked to do this for the entire cafeteria! \n\nSo if it were me, I would probably have worked HARD with my daughter at home on practicing opening those snacks on her own. Did you do this? I also would have sat down in a meeting with the principal and asked that you be allowed to open the snack for her at home and put it in a ziploc, and have that added to her IEP or 504 if needed. If your daughter isn't already on one of those plans, she should be. But I think switching classrooms is a gross overreaction.", "INFO: what is this snack? I feel like that\u2019s important to know for judgement", "NAH.  The teacher is not the A because she is probably following the kinder team guidelines.  You help kids at first, but it now halfway through the year and they should be able to open any snack or lunch item on their own.  If they can't, then the container or item needs to be reconsidered.   Our school starts requiring that in PreK 4. The teacher understands that your child has eating issues, but probably feels like there is something else your daughter likes that you could send instead. \n\n You, as a mom, are not the A because you want your child to have that fun snack and don't view the teacher opening it as a big deal. Honestly, I would been totally in your court before I started teaching.  However, when a child goes to school, they are one of many and teaching teams develop guidelines based on development and what works best for the management of the classroom as a whole.  \n\nYou also commented that the snack can be difficult for an adult to open.  Perhaps the teacher had issues getting it open herself and it just taking too much time.  I have asked parents not to use certain containers because I struggle with them. Carpal tunnel is real!  My thumbs are shot from years of teaching children to cut. \n\nI hope your child does well with her new teacher. I am also glad that her former teacher has parents that love and support her.  It's unfortunate that it got to this point.", "The teacher sounds awful here, just open the snack, it'd take like 2 seconds. I am interested to know how difficult they are to open though.\n\nNTA, I actually struggle to believe a teacher would rather a child not eat than open a snack for them", "Must be the Fort Knox of snacks.", "NTA", "INFO: what was the exact snack? The rules put in place by the school to require pre packaged snacks with no homemade ones in a ziplock are insane but honestly all of the judgement is basically riding on what the snack is.", "While I do see the teacher's point of view that kids should be able to open their own snacks, that comment about \"normal\" snacks should be enough to want to transfer your kid to the care of a less bigoted person. Could some kind of a tool help your daughter with the packaging? Of course a pocket knife on a 5yo at school is not a good idea but maybe there could be something that was both safe and useful. Hard to say since I don't know what makes the package difficult. NTA anyway.\n\nEdit: Another comment mentioned just repackaging the snack in something easier and now I feel dumb. :D Doesn't change my verdict though.", "NTA and wtf? She should be investigating that\u2019s just bizarre and what else is she not doing that she\u2019s supposed to and claiming she\u2019s teaching them independence?", "NTA, but that school seems to have serious control issues. I'm a teacher myself, and we often make adjustments for individual needs if they have a genuine medical reason (but also for kids who do sports or arts on a professional level). For a school having a long list of petty and arbitrary rules \"with no exceptions\" is not an acceptable attitude. You may consider moving your kid not just to another class, but to another school all together is their is an alternative nearby.", "NTA, but the teacher can't be stopping help because of time constraints. However the teacher's comments about \"normal\" snacks isn't ok and was enough of a red flag to the admins that they felt the need to investigate. That should set your mind at ease because you didn't ask for that, the admins felt they needed to do that because the teacher's behavior was concerning. \n\nNow I have an idea for your snack container problem.

I just linked a few examples.", "Going against the grain here and saying YTA simply because when my niece was in kindergarten the teachers said to be sure to send lunch/snacks in packages that the children can open.  It does teach them independence, and also if they only have 10 mins for snack time and the teacher has to open everyone's snacks for them, that cuts into snack time. \n\nAnd honestly, if you are sending your kid to school with a snack that you yourself say is difficult for an adult to open it, you are being a jerk.", "Info what is the snack and why is it so hard to open even for adults?", "Info: why can\u2019t you open the snack and put it in tupperware?", "Info: what was the snack?  Could you have opened it at home and put it in a baggie for your kid to open easily?", "NTA - *she* was the one making things difficult over a snack. Also, if the school had to open an investigation against her, clearly there\u2019s more there and it\u2019s not just about the snack.\nI get the questions about why you couldn\u2019t open it and put it in a Tupperware but it\u2019s kinda besides the point.", "NTA.\n\nIf they are making requirements of how a snack is packaged, then they are responsible for ensuring said packaging is opened for the child if the child has difficulties opening it, regardless of food intolerances/allergies. This has nothing to do with teaching kids \"independence\".", "NTA\n\nThe teacher was either being lazy or malicious. Especially after you talked to her about this. Either way she deserves some scrutiny. \n\nShe can promote independence many other ways.", "Okay but what is this mystery snack?", "Super NTA. they can\u2019t have it both ways where they refuse to let you open the snack beforehand and also refuse to help her. I understand wanting the kids to learn to open their own snacks, but your daughter obviously has some special circumstances that need to be accommodated. And if these mom\u2019s don\u2019t like the way the teacher is being investigated, that\u2019s not your fault or your problem. You only asked for your daughter to be moved. If this caused a full scale investigation of this teacher, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were not the only one who complained about her. And sending you a message to complain about the situation seems very unprofessional.", "Info: have you considered repacking it in a Tupperware container your kid can open on her own? \n\nI think most schools have a policy where the children have to do these things for themselves. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a reasonable request to the teacher. But I am sad that it meant your daughter went hungry. That doesn\u2019t seem ethical on the teachers part. Or yours considering it\u2019s continued over a period of time.", "NTA. \n\nThat teacher. Does she never have to have someone help her open a jar or get something like scissors to open a box? Your child is too young to just toss scissors into her lunchbox obv so she needs a little help. What a jerk. She deserves to be monitored because that could just be the tip of the iceberg.", "I think YTA for disrupting your daughter\u2019s routine over this but you\u2019re NTA because the teacher has forced you into this situation. \n\nYou were told the snack had to be sealed. Okay! Done. You were also told that there would be someone available to help your daughter open it. Awesome! But her teacher won\u2019t help her open it. Boo.\n\nDid the principal offer any other solutions? I know the school is anal about exceptions but the reason they\u2019re called exceptions is because they\u2019re usually handed out to very few people.

But they made it clear it wasn't a request and that they would dispose of snacks that weren't packaged according to policy. :(", "My son\u2019s kindergarten class in a public school required either pre-packaged snacks or plain fruit due to children with severe contact allergies in his classroom. It was not all classrooms and I think most kids with allergies were in that class. It was only a requirement was snack which took place in the classroom. The lunchroom had a specific table for the kids to eat at, with an adult that checked lunches for allergens and wiped down the tables. For his class the kids had a table of hand wipes outside the door that they used upon returning from lunch.  \n\nIt was annoying, but the allergy was severe enough that it warranted the teacher checking snacks. We were also provided a list of safe snack brands not manufactured with nuts. The teacher had enough going on and it simplified things and made it safer. She also had some safe snacks for backup if needed.", "Yup I\u2019m guessing lazy and with what else", "What grade do you teach? Because honestly I don't believe you just from knowing other teachers. A parent doing something that makes the teachers job harder and then expecting the teacher to do it daily is the issue. That does not make the teacher lazy or spiteful it makes her fair.

Since only the teacher would likely have one, I think it's fair to expect of the teacher to intervene here. \n\nFurther, one element of becoming independent as a child is learning what you can do yourself and what needs assistance. For the kid to know she needs to ask the teacher to open her snack, considering its packaging, is very reasonable.\n\nThe parent is going through quite a bit of effort to help her child fit in with all the other kids at snack time, despite the restrictive school rules - that deserves some credit. NTA.", "I understand the independence part but at my son\u2019s school they request things are packed in containers the kids can open. \n\nAny packaging we try to start ripping so it\u2019s easier but they also encourage the kids to get their scissors and cut open the package (even in kindergarten which starts at age 4 here).\n\nThis school seems to have ridiculous policies that may have reasons but absolutely don\u2019t work together especially in a kindergarten class. \n\nAlso for the teacher to say it\u2019s not normal?! \n\nNTA, I would want a meeting with the school", "What a disgusting comment.

They can\u2019t repackage it", "Accept my judgement but for into: snack time is 25 minutes and there are 8 kids in her class", "Also curious", "For reasons I don't understand, they request the child's snack be a single serve snack item that is sealed.", "This op your child should be able to open her own snack or you open it for her", "I had the idea that maybe there could be some kind of a safe tool to help with it and after seeing your comment I now feel incredibly stupid. :D", "School requires a single serve snack item in a sealed package!", "Read her edit. The school won't allow repackaging.", "The teacher opened it until she didn't. Mom was sending her daughter with food she couldn't open. That is a stupid thing to do as a parent.\n\nFurther, OP's edit doesn't pass the smell test. No school requires original packaging because no school requires prepackaged food. \n\nIf you can put a handful of grapes or a homemade sandwich in a bag or piece of Tupperware, then you can do the same thing with Dr Bronner's tofu and sawdust chocolate-free chips a-soy cookies.", "Reach out to the administration if you have years left at this school. That's a dumb rule. Schools (and other institutions) like to make pointless dumb rules sometimes that they need to be called out on. If it was a snack that was being shared with the entire class that rule would make sense. A classroom snack is no different than a lunch though. If they give you a hard time pull the food allergy card and send them the packaging label to \"note in her file\".", "No, they didn't.\n\nNo school requires prepackaged foods. Kids can't bring a homemade sandwich, but a sealed gas station sandwich is cool? \n\nGet out of here with that.", ">\"I sent the teacher an email explaining that the snack is quite tough to open (even for adults sometimes)\"\n\nThen OP shouldn't be sending a snack that she herself admits is too hard for ADULTS to open for her 5 year old to struggle with. That's an AH move right there. Send a different snack.", "Can you snip the corner? Something not so obvious that it\u2019s cut that also makes it easier for your child to open?", "Then the OP should have asked that this be an accommodation that is included on her 504 or IEP. Or, since I am assuming this is not the only thing she can eat, sent something else in to school for snack time until her daughter can figure out how to open the package.", "But they allow lunch to be unsealed items like sandwiches? I would send the snack she likes for lunch, but you unseal it and put it in a ziploc so she can unwrap it herself. \n\nFor snack... are there other sealed items that are safe for her to eat? Surely it not just this one hard to open item that is the *only* option.", "Is this a private school? I've never heard of such a thing in public school.", "Then mom should be sending a different snack. OP says this snack is hard for ADULTS to open. Why is she sending it every day and expecting the teacher to wrestle with the packaging? Sending a different snack. AH move.", "I'd like to know if this is a precautionary measure or based on an actual problem.  They're not checking the snacks anyway it seems, so kids could be eating prepackaged allergens, and the teachers might not notice.  If this system is supposed to be preventative, it sounds unnecessary.", "I suggest that you include this in your post, because it's a valid question and also highlights that you don't do this by choice, so the school should accommodate her, since it's this policy that creates the problem for your daughter.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re an asshole, but I probably would have requested special permission for her to have this snack out of the original packaging. Or tried to score an edge of the packaging to see if it being slightly torn would have helped her open it.", "This is so wild to me. My son's pre-primary class had a zero waste policy for snacks and lunches or else all rubbish got put back into lunch boxes and sent home.", "Really you don\u2019t know?! As a parent of a child with allergies you should be supporting it. Entitled Parents have lied about \u201creally fun\u201d snacks fitting allergy guidelines that now they need everything in the original packaging to confirm ingredients.", "She added an edit as to why, the school supposedly mandated that snacks be packed in their original packaging", "You don't think OP would rather send an easier snack with their kid? The kid has severe food restrictions", "How difficult can it be though? I'd love to know the snack, if it is genuinely difficult then she should try and get another snack", "Yeah, you put it rather more bluntly than I did and you're absolutely correct in doing so.", "Thanks for pointing it out. What a stupid school policy. Why would they even care about snack packaging? And if the school specifically promised that there would be someone to help and there wasn't, it might be a good idea to switch to a different school altogether. They apparently don't care too much about the well being of their students.", "Pfft, I'd switch schools over this.", "That makes absolutely no sense.\n\nHave you ever asked for the reasons and if not why haven't you? \n\nHave you asked for an exception for your daughter?\n\nOptionally you could have gotten your daughter one of those child scissors if those can handle the snacks packaging.", "Are you allowed to home make the other foods she brings?! Lunch sandwiches? Are just snacks to be in sealed packages? It doesn\u2019t even make sense? Sorry I have so many questions.", "So you can't prepare something homemade for your kid?", "What is the snack?", "Call me TA all you want, but the school does mandate packaged food. Somebody else commented that it's probably so they can confirm ingredients. I'm not sure what the reason is, but snack foods have to be pre packaged or they will not let the kids eat them.", "Agreed. If the school really does have this policy I\u2019d go to the school board. They can\u2019t expect parents to follow this. Many packaged snacks are cost prohibitive and are not healthy (at least where I live). The most they care about is 1. No peanuts (or other allergies in the class I guess) 2. Not too much prepackaged processed foods (you\u2019ll literally get a food shaming letter)", "Yeah I was getting confused on this one. I bake a lot of my kids snacks (tedious but cheaper!) and put them in reusable containers. \n\nIf a school told me I couldn't do that I'd be making a stink tbh.\n\nETA - and funnily enough it was because my son has anaphylaxis, so I knew my food was safe. Hes grown out of most of the allergies so I don't need to anymore but the habit has stuck", "My child's school requires sealed, prepackaged foods for the in-classroom snack but not for lunch in the cafeteria.", "My son\u2019s public kindergarten classroom had a few kids with severe food allergies. In addition to requiring single serve sealed snacks (couldn\u2019t pack homemade snacks) they also had to use hand wipes upon classroom entry. The exception was fruit. Yes, having to buy single serving snacks was annoying and I hated the waste, but the teacher needed ingredient lists to make sure she wasn\u2019t exposing the kids to deadly allergens that just needed contact for a reaction.", "How can that be true? That would mean that only processed packaged snacks are allowed into the school. Where I live if you send your kid with premade and packaged snacks every day you are very likely to be receiving a letter reminding you that packages aren\u2019t healthy.", "That's how you know the story isn't real.", "I suspect there are probably other snacks she could eat. What did she eat for snack before OP found this \"fun\" snack that is so impossible to open? \n\nSending her to school with a snack she cannot open herself is not a reasonable plan. Have that snack after school, or have mom open it herself and put it in a baggie so she can eat it at lunchtime.", "My guess about the packaging is they want it sealed to know what the ingredients are for allergies. Parents aren\u2019t always honest about what\u2019s in the snack and if they had an incident prior regarding the allergies and snacks in the past, they\u2019ll enforce it. \n\nSnack is in the classroom, lunch they have in the cafeteria and they may have tables that are allergy safe. Thus being able to not have prepackaged snacks for lunch.\n\nWhen we have been in classes with the packaged snack rule\u2026sliced apples packaged or an apple sauce or banana/tangerine were things I would send in and not have an issue with it with the school.", "Right! It seems terrible, I hope the teacher learns from this experience \ud83d\ude2d", "That sounds asinine. I'd have never had a snack as a kid in that school. We didn't have money for pre-packaged single-serve anything.", "I don't believe your edit. In the body of your post, you sent this product with your child because you wanted her to have something fun to eat.\n\nWhen that didn't gain traction, you pivoted and created a pre-packaged snack mandate.", "I'm curious why the policy is different at lunch vs snack in the OP's case...", "This post is faker than my mom's love for me.", "I have seen this in classrooms where there have been food allergies currently or in the past. If someone brings opened food or zip locked food the teacher then has to watch to make sure the kid doesn\u2019t share with another kid that might have a reaction as no one knows what was in that snack. In packaged snacks if there is a reaction, the teacher and school can provide the actual ingredient and food item to the parents or medical team. It isn\u2019t the healthiest option but with small children and potentially life threatening allergies this is becoming more normal", "Only OP knows if it\u2019s true or not, I\u2019m just reiterating what she has said since a lot of people are still asking about why she can\u2019t* re-package the snack despite the edit on OP\u2019s post. \n\nMy little one isn\u2019t old enough to start school yet, so I don\u2019t know what kind of food restrictions they may have placed in our local district.\n\nEdited, grammar", "Literally no homemade snacks. It drives me nuts.", "Plus it's unhealthy.

Some schools are just happy to see kids with sandwiches that doesn\u2019t contain moldy bread. I wish I was kidding.", "Her lunch had to be packaged too? Like if she eats a sandwich it\u2019s a pre made sealed one from the store?", "In the places where I have seen this the teacher has a stockpile of available snacks that other parents have brought or donated or the teacher has provided.", "Lunches are different, supposedly because it's a \"classroom\" vs \"cafeteria\" difference. It's ridiculous to me but I've tried to follow the rules"]}
