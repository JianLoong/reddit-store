On Tuesday, when I opened her bag I found that the snack was in there untouched, so I asked her why. She told me it was too tough for her to open. I asked her about previous weeks and she told me that her teacher used to help her but doesn't anymore. I encouraged her to ask her teacher the next day. \n\nThe next day the snack was still unopened, and when I asked her about it she told me that the teacher told her that she needs to learn to open her snacks at snacktime all by herself. I sent the teacher an email explaining that the snack is quite tough to open (even for adults sometimes) and that it would be super helpful if she could help my daughter open her snack when she is unable to do so, otherwise she has an 8 hour school day with only her lunchtime to eat. I was nice about it - but you better believe it did tick me off a bit that she would rather let a kid go without a snack while all the other kids ate one than help a 5 year old open a snack. \n\nI picked her up on Thurs and she still had an unopened snack. At this point, I called the teacher to ask what was going on and she said that their goal the last few months of Kindergarten is to promote independence and that she can't do that if they have to hold the kids hand at every turn. She said it might help if I sent my kid in with a \"normal\" snack instead of such a \"bizarre, difficult to open\" one. She is VERY aware of my daughter's food intolerances.\n\nAt this point, I politely thanked her and called her principal asking him to move my daughter to a different classroom. I said that it was very inappropriate to emphasize that my daughter's snacks weren't \"normal\" enough, given that she is unable to live a normal life. I wish I could give her some Cheetos or a pack of cookies like the other kids get, but I can't and just wanted my daughter to have something a little bit more fun when all the other kids were eating those things. She moved rooms but her previous teacher sent me a message about how I've really made things difficult over a snack - apparently they've started an investigation and are monitoring the way she interacts with kids. Two of the mom's that she knows better than me commented in the mom's group chat that the way the teacher was being treated in regards to this is \"completely unfair\" and that a child's food issues shouldn't be their teacher's issue to deal with. So, am I the asshole? Should I just have sent in a different snack?\n\nTl; dr: My daughter's teacher wouldn't open her snacks because they weren't \"normal\" enough, so I had her moved to a different classroom.\n\nEdit: Asked a couple times why I can't open the snack before school. For some reason, school policy is that the snack has to be a single serve item in a sealed package. Not sure why! I asked for an exception when I first sent the snack in months ago and was told they don't make exceptions to this rule for one kid because they would have to make it for everyone, but that there would be someone in her classroom willing to help her. Kindergarteners are also not allowed to carry their own scissors - no exceptions.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of questions about snipping. There's 8 kids in the class and the teacher checks to make sure none of them are open. Yes, I'm aware this does not sound legit but we received an email in September reminding us that snacks need to be sealed and unopened - I'm pretty positive that my kid is not the only one that's had issues opening snacks but I can't confirm because I haven't brought it up to anybody. (Lowkey if the teacher can walk around and check every package to make sure it isn't open I'm not sure why the extra two seconds it takes to open one is such a big deal but maybe that makes me the AH)", "created_utc": 1677850924, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11h12tt/aita_for_having_my_daughter_move_classrooms/", "score": 2345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, your kid will face worse problems and you went nuclear instead of double down with the teacher or asking the principal to insist she open it. If this is her only issue with this teacher, you went nuclear. Also when she gets a shit teacher for real, your ability to advocate for your kid just decreased. Yta for moving her rather than just having the principal force the issue.", "ESH. They are trying to teach kids how to do these basic life skills in kindergarten but it's also wrong to let a child go hungry over this. I would have just started putting it in Tupperware, their request that individual snacks be in single served packages is just that,  a request. Common sense dictates that if my child can't open it I will just put it in different packaging. I wouldn't have gotten to the point that you did with the teacher bc I would have repackaged the snack but had I and the teacher had been stubborn enough about not opening a snack I would have wanted a new teacher as well.", "NTA\u2026 as a teacher myself, I can\u2019t comprehend why this would even be an issue.

You could have also opened it at home and put it in a easier to open bag/ container for your child.", "YTA- you are at fault for treating an overworked teacher that is trying to balance numerous students\u2019 needs but you expect to stop everything to accommodate the \u201creally fun\u201d snack you found for your daughter that fits her dietary needs. You even admit it\u2019s difficult for an adult to open.\n\nI suspect there are \u201cless fun\u201d snacks you can also send. But clearly having \u201creally fun\u201d snacks is a status symbol that more important to you than following the policy of students opening their own snacks. To file a complaint over it is inexcusable and will impact your daughter in future as I know teachers will be requesting not to have your daughter in their class due to your behaviour", "NTA the teacher is being abilist", "INFO: are you not able to make a small snip in the packaging? It would probably be unnoticeable to teachers and would help your child open it easier.", "NTA because they gave you no other options.

The teacher should have been more helpful.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you're focusing on your kid's well-being. That should always be your first priority. Switching kindergarten classes isn't a huge deal; if your child's needs aren't being met that's a simple and sane solution.\n\nSide question: is this snack something you could open and repackage at home? Maybe put it in a sandwich bag or Mason jar?\n\nEdit: a Ziploc bag or Mason jar or even a Tupperware container are all packages that \"seal.\" This school policy sounds very odd - are they trying to encourage cookies and chips? What's wrong with apple slices in a baggie, for instance? What's the difference between an Uncrustable and half a PB&J in a sandwich bag?", "YTA- 100% because from your post you think the teacher needs to help every kid open up a snack every day. Get over your fun snack that is making the job harder and do your job as a parent and make it easier on the child", "Provided everything in this post is true, NTA. Also, for the teacher to contact you afterwards and complain about your concerns was really unprofessional. I teach high school students who need help with opening stuff sometimes, or fixing things...and sometimes I ask them for help, too. While I understand the need for teaching independence, I feel like this was a weird hill to die on due to the dietary restrictions. \n\nThis also discourages the little girl from asking for help. What kind of kindergarten teacher wants that for their students?", "If your child is THAT special or that allergic, maybe you should homeschool. If she can't open the snack, than send her with another snack she can. Save the \"fun\" snack for after school when you can help her. Sure, the teacher could help, but it's not their job to potentially get in trouble over. I'd be furious, too, as the teacher, if my job was being scrutinized over opening a 'special' snack for a 'special' child. What's next, considering you did this, and she's not even in 1st grade yet? YTA", "YTA. \n\nIt isn't a teacher's job to open thirty individual snacks during a break period. Occasionally helping a struggling kid isn't a big deal. Doing it every day is too much.\n\nYou are the one sending your child to school with something they can't open. That is on you.\n\nWhat's next? Are you going to send her to school with a can of Campbell's Soup and no way to open it?\n\nYour edit defies credulity. \n\nNo school on the planet requires original packaging because no school on the planet requires prepackaged foods.\n\nIf you can put a handful of grapes or a homemade sandwich in a bag or piece of Tupperware, then you can do the same thing with Dr Bronner's tofu and sawdust chocolate-free chips a-soy cookies.", "As I reading this :  \"I encouraged her to ask her teacher the next day.\", the first thing I though was : why the hell can't you teach your kid to open the damn snack ? She's 5 for God's sakes.\n\nYou're not doing your kid any favors by not teaching her how to be independent. In a few months, she won't have a teacher to help her at all with snacks. She'll have to deal with it on her own.\n\nYTA, and I feel for the next teachers because you're the parent they all fear...", "NTA because their rule about repackaged snacks is dumb.", "Info: Is there any particular reason why you couldn\u2019t open the snack and put it in a ziplock bag or something easier for your daughter to open?\n\n\n\nEdited to add: NTA.", "[removed]", "Would the teacher or the mommy princesses who criticized you be willing to assume your child\u2019s hospital bills?", "NTA as the school won't let you repackage it first.\n\nAlso, I hope you've screenshotted the conversation of the mother's moaning and shared that with the principal as that shows teacher has been gossiping (unless you've been telling people?)", "Info - I am dying of curiosity. What is this snack?", "NTA--you really tried to work with the teacher. And the fact that the teacher emailed you about the investigation shows a lack of judgement and that it's unlikely it would have helped to keep working things out. That was extremely inappropriate of her and you should forward it to the school.", "NTA You searched for a solution to your childs problem. It\u00b4s not like you asked them to investigate the teacher. And if someone makes a comment about it you should tell them exactly that.", "YTA\n\nFormer teacher here. \n\nI get why you are frustrated. However you are thinking in parent mode, not looking at this from the perspective of a teacher, who likely has 22 students in the class. The entire reason independence is encouraged is because if the teacher is needed to help a student with every little task, you have to keep in mind that *it's not just your kid*. You  have to multiply that action times 22 kids any time you do *anything*. \n\nKids need to be toilet trained before entering K because not only can the teacher not stop instructing to help one child wipe their butt, they really can't stop the lesson 22 times a day to help 22 kids wipe their butts. They cannot tie 22 pairs of shoes every time it's time to go out to recess because you did not teach your child to tie laces, but hope the teacher will do this. And I know it seems like opening your child's snack is a small thing, but opening 22 snacks at snack time, poking the straws into 22 juice boxes, and then repeating the same thing at lunch,  opening 22 lunch items plus poking the straws into 22 juice boxes... takes up a lot of time! Imagine being the cafeteria monitor and being asked to do this for the entire cafeteria! \n\nSo if it were me, I would probably have worked HARD with my daughter at home on practicing opening those snacks on her own. Did you do this? I also would have sat down in a meeting with the principal and asked that you be allowed to open the snack for her at home and put it in a ziploc, and have that added to her IEP or 504 if needed. If your daughter isn't already on one of those plans, she should be. But I think switching classrooms is a gross overreaction.", "INFO: what is this snack? I feel like that\u2019s important to know for judgement", "NAH.  The teacher is not the A because she is probably following the kinder team guidelines.  You help kids at first, but it now halfway through the year and they should be able to open any snack or lunch item on their own.  If they can't, then the container or item needs to be reconsidered.   Our school starts requiring that in PreK 4. The teacher understands that your child has eating issues, but probably feels like there is something else your daughter likes that you could send instead. \n\n You, as a mom, are not the A because you want your child to have that fun snack and don't view the teacher opening it as a big deal. Honestly, I would been totally in your court before I started teaching.  However, when a child goes to school, they are one of many and teaching teams develop guidelines based on development and what works best for the management of the classroom as a whole.  \n\nYou also commented that the snack can be difficult for an adult to open.  Perhaps the teacher had issues getting it open herself and it just taking too much time.  I have asked parents not to use certain containers because I struggle with them. Carpal tunnel is real!  My thumbs are shot from years of teaching children to cut. \n\nI hope your child does well with her new teacher. I am also glad that her former teacher has parents that love and support her.  It's unfortunate that it got to this point.", "The teacher sounds awful here, just open the snack, it'd take like 2 seconds. I am interested to know how difficult they are to open though.\n\nNTA, I actually struggle to believe a teacher would rather a child not eat than open a snack for them", "Must be the Fort Knox of snacks.", "NTA", "INFO: what was the exact snack? The rules put in place by the school to require pre packaged snacks with no homemade ones in a ziplock are insane but honestly all of the judgement is basically riding on what the snack is.", "While I do see the teacher's point of view that kids should be able to open their own snacks, that comment about \"normal\" snacks should be enough to want to transfer your kid to the care of a less bigoted person. Could some kind of a tool help your daughter with the packaging? Of course a pocket knife on a 5yo at school is not a good idea but maybe there could be something that was both safe and useful. Hard to say since I don't know what makes the package difficult. NTA anyway.\n\nEdit: Another comment mentioned just repackaging the snack in something easier and now I feel dumb. :D Doesn't change my verdict though.", "NTA and wtf? She should be investigating that\u2019s just bizarre and what else is she not doing that she\u2019s supposed to and claiming she\u2019s teaching them independence?", "NTA, but that school seems to have serious control issues. I'm a teacher myself, and we often make adjustments for individual needs if they have a genuine medical reason (but also for kids who do sports or arts on a professional level). For a school having a long list of petty and arbitrary rules \"with no exceptions\" is not an acceptable attitude. You may consider moving your kid not just to another class, but to another school all together is their is an alternative nearby.", "NTA, but the teacher can't be stopping to help because of time constraints. However the teacher's comments about \"normal\" snacks isn't ok and was enough of a red flag to the admins that they felt the need to investigate. That should set your mind at ease because you didn't ask for that, the admins felt they needed to do that because the teacher's behavior was concerning. \n\nNow I have an idea for your snack container problem.

I just linked a few examples.", "Going against the grain here and saying YTA simply because when my niece was in kindergarten the teachers said to be sure to send lunch/snacks in packages that the children can open.  It does teach them independence, and also if they only have 10 mins for snack time and the teacher has to open everyone's snacks for them, that cuts into snack time. \n\nAnd honestly, if you are sending your kid to school with a snack that you yourself say is difficult for an adult to open it, you are being a jerk.", "Info what is the snack and why is it so hard to open even for adults?", "Info: why can\u2019t you open the snack and put it in tupperware?", "Info: what was the snack?

Either way she deserves some scrutiny. \n\nShe can promote independence many other ways.", "Okay but what is this mystery snack?", "Super NTA. they can\u2019t have it both ways where they refuse to let you open the snack beforehand and also refuse to help her.

Boo.\n\nDid the principal offer any other solutions?

It was not all classrooms and I think most kids with allergies were in that class. It was only a requirement was snack which took place in the classroom. The lunchroom had a specific table for the kids to eat at, with an adult that checked lunches for allergens and wiped down the tables. For his class the kids had a table of hand wipes outside the door that they used upon returning from lunch.  \n\nIt was annoying, but the allergy was severe enough that it warranted the teacher checking snacks.

She also had some safe snacks for backup if needed.", "Yup I\u2019m guessing lazy and with what else", "What grade do you teach? Because honestly I don't believe you just from knowing other teachers. A parent doing something that makes the teachers job harder and then expecting the teacher to do it daily is the issue. That does not make the teacher lazy or spiteful it makes her fair.

And not just on one day, but multiple days! That\u2019s just cruel. At the very least what she should have done is kept opening the snack for the child, but just proactively reached out to the parents about the snack being hard to open, and requesting they find another alternative.\n\nAlso, I know this varies by school, but I\u2019m finding it hard to believe that an investigation was begun just over one parent who didn\u2019t even request an investigation, just a classroom change. I wasn\u2019t exactly a teacher but I worked with schools and daycares enough to get the impression that investigations into teachers take multiple complaints.

(Lowkey if the teacher can walk around and check every package to make sure it isn't open I'm not sure why the extra two seconds it takes to open one is such a big deal but maybe that makes me the AH)\n\nIts a moot point now, but is there an area on the snack where the ends are sealed that is thick enough to snip, but does not break the seal. Then your child would be able to open the snack independently and still be in a sealed wrapper?

At worst, you have the child come up to where you are, supervise the use of scissors, and make sure the snack is opened, especially in kindergarten.  The school can't demand the snacks be in single serve packaging and remove avenues for the child to open the snack AND still tout independence.  Switching classrooms is appropriate if the teacher's response to a child struggling to open food is to shrug and say, \"well, too bad.\"\n\nAlso, I was a cafeteria monitor for the kindergarten group.

Also, watching her classmates eat while going on an empty stomach can raise all sorts of feelings that may contribute to an unhealthy relationship with food in the future, on top of the allergies. Third, her own view of independence is messed up big time: knowing the limit between autonomy and need for help allows for independence, not knowing will lead to a person too hard on themselves that tend to make really dumb decisions. Like carrying a piano and a sofa on your back if you need to move lol or snapping your back because you can't reach the highest shelf. Communication and cooperation allow efficient independence, so her argument isn't even accurate. Finally, telling the situation to other moms, calling allergy specific food not normal...
