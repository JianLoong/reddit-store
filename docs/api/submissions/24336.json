My wife (36f), is a skeptic of American medicine and has been upset with how much I use my phone.\n\nSo to start, we have an 18 month old baby that we take care of, but I wake up groggy and grumpy every day and have been for decades. So when I finally had the chance to take a sleep study, I jumped on it.\n\nNow, I got the results back 2 days ago, and it came back positive. Obstructive sleep apnea. I wasn't surprised. What did surprise me was the price of a machine, nearly $900. So I booked an appointment to get the machine.\n\nMy wife was livid. She told me that it's too much to pay, that I have student loans to pay off, that she's been saving all this money just for me to waste on myself, when she hasn't gotten a good night's sleep in over a year and a half. \n\nShe says that since I sleep heavily, I might at sleep better than she does. So last night, she was saying all I need to do is \"Don't be in your phone all the time and you'll sleep better.\" I was tired of her always thinking she's smarter than doctors so I abruptly said \"F*ck you.\" and stormed out of the room.\n\nNow it's today. I cancelled the appointment, I'm not expecting anything to get better, she is still not speaking to me, and I'm wondering if I'm wrong here. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: to clarify, we have more than a year's income in savings, so at this point we are hoarding money. Also, she told me it was \"just doctors trying to make money\". Also, she told me to my face \"you wouldn't use it anyway\". Lastly, I do use my phone at night, but only to combat existing insomnia. So if I get a good night's rest, I am less likely to overuse coffee to stay alert during the day, breaking the cycle of coffee -> bad night's sleep -> coffee.\n\nEdit 2: I'm only 130lbs, so it's clearly not a weight/diabetic issue. We have two beds, one in the master bedroom and one in the basement across the house, so it wouldn't be a noise issue to get one. And I understand I need to be nicer about this. It's not the first time I've sought medical help (she doesn't really believe in psychology or therapy) and she pushes back on every decision, so I admit I snapped and need to work on that. My results were 5.1 stoppages per hour on average, and lowest blood oxygen level was 89% average.\n\nEdit 3: I've gone ahead and ordered a machine.", "created_utc": 1691686765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nhxbe/aita_for_saying_f_u_to_my_wife_for_her_medical/", "score": 7358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get being angry about it, but you went way overboard.\n\nThat being said, your wife is so incredibly, horribly wrong. When I got the results of my sleep study, my wife was thrilled. She was thrilled, not because my OSA was confirmed, but that I would get a CPAP and stop snoring. Also, as an RN, she knew how much my life was about to improve. It was arguably one of the best days of my life when I finally got my CPAP. I got my first good night of sleep in years. \n\nThere have been a handful of times where I had to sleep without my CPAP and the results are always horrible. I'm disoriented, grumpy, and distracted all day long-- and tired-- soooo tired. Sometimes it takes a couple of days to recover. I was recently visiting friends for the weekend and somehow left my bag with my CPAP in it in my garage. I ended up getting to their home in the afternoon and then stayed really late and went home instead of spending the night. I couldn't bear putting myself through a bad night or following day just to spend time with my friends.\n\nAnd not for nothing, but you're obviously snoring, which is likely disturbing your wife's sleep. My wife would wake up regularly because of my snoring, and it's effect on her, while not as bad as my OSA, was still a problem. Your wife will probably sleep better once you get the CPAP. Are you sure your insurance won't cover it? Mine was covered other than a $25 upkeep fee each month. If you really can't get them to cover it, you might consider looking at refurbished ones for sale. You can get one of them for under $300.", "OP get that appointment back. Sleep apnea can KILL YOU. It also hurts massively with regards to you being able to concentrate and stuff.

Yes, the device is really expensive, but it'll also be a massive quality of life improvement.\n\nAs for \"wasting money\" you don't want to buy something trivial or recreational, you want to buy a medically necessary device.

Sleep apnea means your body has to physically WAKE YOU UP in order to resume breathing.  You never achieve REM sleep because you are literally waking up every couple of minutes.  It causes high blood pressure, not to mention dangerous drowsiness.  The CPAP machine forces air pressure into your nose which prevents your airway from closing.

Now, let me tell you a little story on how he came to get that machine.\n\nAs I said, my husband had OSA and has probably had it his whole life. When we got together I always noticed his face was puffy/swollen when he woke up. And he also would fall asleep super easily when we'd be hanging out. I knew he got a decent amount of sleep time wise so I figured this was just normal. However, he'd always claim he was tired, all day every day. \n\nYears later and after 3 kids things are still the same for him sleep wise. Gets decent amount of sleep but still tired. I finally looked up sleep apnea and urged him to get checked out. Here's the thing, we didn't have insurance and the study was a lot of money. And the machines even more money. So we kind of put it on the back burner. \n\nWell, one morning he called me and told me he had had an accident in his work truck on the way to work but that he was fine. When he was able to talk more later I learned that he had actually fallen asleep at the wheel and driven into a water canal, that was thankfully empty (it was one of those irrigation ones for farmers). His work truck was totaled but thank whatever higher power there is he was ok and just as important that he hadn't hurt anyone else. \n\nThere was no arguing now, he needs to do that damn sleep study ASAP. \n\nWe still didn't have insurance but actually found a place online that sent you the devices to do an at home sleep study and they received the sleep data/results wirelessly and within 2 days a sleep study person/doctor was on the phone with him going over results and recommending the best machine. This was around 3 years and cost around $250, no more than $300. It turned out my husband has a severe case of OSA and honestly it's a wonder he hadn't died during his sleep before. \n\nNow we have to look at the cost of the machine. The one recommended for his particular sleep apnea was $1,600 (this is USD). We didn't even have that laying around to spare but thankfully the website we got it from had those buy now pay in payments over 28 months so we did that. \n\nLet me tell you, that first night with the bipap machine was life changing for my husband. I shit you not, the next morning he woke up saying he felt awesome. Not tired at all. And remember how I said his face was always swollen in the morning? There was no hint of any swelling, no puffiness, nothing, nada, zilch. Literally, one night use and already the results were amazing. And since then he uses it. The nights he doesn't use it from accidentally falling asleep or knocking it off he wakws up with a swollen face again so he tries to not go without it because even just one night without it and he feels awful. \n\nSo I get it the whole money issue but please, make that appointment again and if you have to get a machine on payments, please do that.

And I was still young enough that my recovery was only three or four weeks.", "Was gonna mention this to your comment about his lack of savings but felt it was a bit dark \ud83d\ude02", "I was coming here to add how when untreated it could lead to heart issues. She doesn\u2019t have to believe in the doctor for herself but shouldn\u2019t try to influence him against medical attention.", "I used to wake up gasping for breath, like I would instantly sit bolt upright. It was noticeable when I was on the verge of falling asleep mostly. Maybe I should get checked.", "If it is blowing air in his face. It isn't adjusted right or isn't sealing correctly.  I have one and it took about a month to get used to.  Sleep is so much better now.  There are different types of masks.  He should try the different ones and get it fitted.", "And modern machines can tattle to your doctor, so it doesn't do any good to lie and say you use it every night. \n\nI have used one for years and am now on my third machine. Husband refuses to get a sleep study, and I *know* that he needs one. He snores. The snores get more strangled as his airway collapses. He stops breathing. Then he snorts and kicks and the cycle starts again. Takes about 10 minutes. We no longer share either a room or a bed because I object to being kicked and woken up over and over just as I start to doze off. It was either move to the guest room or smother him with a pillow, and I'm too old and creaky to do well in prison.", "Gotta pray the oxygen into your lungs! It's the only way! Or some supplement that has nothing to do with anything but is super expensive and Gwyneth Paltrow says it's cool.", "I did that too.  Also when falling asleep I would feel paralyzed and struggle to breath.  Once I got the CPAP it stopped. I've had it for 8 years...life changer.", "I use one. I have to use the whole face mask rather than just the nose one (I would sleep with my mouth open otherwise). I did have a small adjustment period with the  airflow initially but not much. I think it can depend on how strong an airflow they determine is needed and how sensitive the person is. It also DOES depend on getting the mask on properly, which is a problem my dad had back when he first tried it out. He got retested and they want him to try it again now and it might work since he\u2019s now living in an assisted living apartment and can utilize the helpers there to assure that it\u2019s put on correctly (unfortunately, there\u2019s a big chance he\u2019ll mess it up throughout the night getting up to pee & end up not wearing it the whole night because he won\u2019t call for the helpers to help him in the middle of the night). Getting fitted for one was delayed due to a recent visit to the ER for a BP issue.", "I had over 400.\n\nOP is NTA", "My wife used to say sometimes my breathing stopped so long she would reach out and touch me to see if I was still alive. Been using BiPAP for at least 15 years, and I am an enthusiastic evangelist of PAP sleep therapy.", "Jesus Christ, what was your O2 saturation? My fianc\u00e9 had an AHI of 120.5 and his O2 sat was 72%."]}
