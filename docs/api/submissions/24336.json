I get being angry about it, but you went way overboard.\n\nThat being said, your wife is so incredibly, horribly wrong. When I got the results of my sleep study, my wife was thrilled. She was thrilled, not because my OSA was confirmed, but that I would get a CPAP and stop snoring. Also, as an RN, she knew how much my life was about to improve. It was arguably one of the best days of my life when I finally got my CPAP. I got my first good night of sleep in years. \n\nThere have been a handful of times where I had to sleep without my CPAP and the results are always horrible. I'm disoriented, grumpy, and distracted all day long-- and tired-- soooo tired. Sometimes it takes a couple of days to recover. I was recently visiting friends for the weekend and somehow left my bag with my CPAP in it in my garage. I ended up getting to their home in the afternoon and then stayed really late and went home instead of spending the night. I couldn't bear putting myself through a bad night or following day just to spend time with my friends.\n\nAnd not for nothing, but you're obviously snoring, which is likely disturbing your wife's sleep. My wife would wake up regularly because of my snoring, and it's effect on her, while not as bad as my OSA, was still a problem. Your wife will probably sleep better once you get the CPAP. Are you sure your insurance won't cover it? Mine was covered other than a $25 upkeep fee each month. If you really can't get them to cover it, you might consider looking at refurbished ones for sale.

Sleep apnea means your body has to physically WAKE YOU UP in order to resume breathing.  You never achieve REM sleep because you are literally waking up every couple of minutes.  It causes high blood pressure, not to mention dangerous drowsiness.  The CPAP machine forces air pressure into your nose which prevents your airway from closing.

Anyone who isn't, at bare minimum, giving you an ESH is wrong. If you can't afford the machine right now, that is fair.  Unless a doctor has said this is urgent (maybe, maybe not, plenty of people have sleep apnea and I do know people who treat it differently)... I'm imagining it's not urgent, since you managed to go so long and manage.\n\nHard to say that she told you thinks she is smarter than doctors, and \"we can't afford that, can you try other things first or get a second opinion?\" isn't her being unreasonable and doesn't warrant an FU.

It\u2019s not just something that makes you tired! It increases your risks of cardiac issues as well. It makes neuro harder and a ton of other things. Rebook the appointment now!!! And second. She is correct. You will sleep better if you are off your phone and tv for an hour leading up to bedtime. HOWEVER\u2026not being on your phone won\u2019t fix sleep apnea. So she\u2019s right you will sleep better but she\u2019s wrong that it will fix the apnea.", "NTA. Get that appointment back on the books.

Before, I could hear him snore, hold his breath, and gasp in his sleep. And he was always exhausted. He could nap at 10am on a weekend after waking at 8. And his drive to and from work could be scary due to drowsiness. All that has changed. For the better. \n\nI will tell you, that from what I understand health insurance does typically cover a medically prescribed CPAP machine.

My ex's parents almost got divorced, they were so miserable together after thirty years.

I paid a bunch for one and stopped using it pretty quickly.\n\nThat's one opinion. My brother would likely agree.\n\nFor me? From the first time I used one, I was pleased with how much it helped. Now I don't know how I ever got to sleep without it. If there's a power outage, I can't sleep because just as I'm almost there, I'll wake myself up by snoring. \n\nBut I'm lucky to have health insurance, so I didn't have to pay anything but the \"upgrade\" costs for the better machine.", "Concrete objections to medical advice?

It sounds like he\u2019s been dealing with undiagnosed sleep apnea for awhile, which has probably already placed a lot of stress on his cardiovascular system. He could go to sleep one night and not wake up because his heart decided it has reached its limit. Being a widow or having to be a caretaker for a husband with hemiparesis or other residual from a stroke, with a new baby will be pretty hard too.

That doesn't mean that people do not need it. It just means they are not taking good care of themselves. \n\nIt's just like when a diabetic eats a dozen donuts and survives because they gave themselves insulin. Yeah, you can do it, but it doesn't mean it's a good idea or medically sound.", "Sleep Apnea kills people. I know plenty of people with it too, and they don't treat it, but that doesn't mean it cannot kill them at any time. You literally stop breathing in your sleep. The wife dismissing his sleep apnea diagnosis and throwing a hissy fit is absolutely being unreasonable. Get a second opinion of what? Another sleep study? They will do another one once he gets the machine to then figure out what setting he needs to be at during sleep.\n\nIn fact, anesthesiologists are now asking if you have sleep apnea because it can absolutely cause issues while you're under sedation. \\*\\* To add, my husband has been asked to bring his machine with him during surgical procedures\\*\\*", "Yep.
