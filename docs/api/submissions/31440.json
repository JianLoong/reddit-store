And yes YTA for impulsively shaving your son\u2019s hair as well. My bets are if you would have made an effort to figure out how to properly remove the gum from your daughters hair and avoided having to cut it out, you wouldn\u2019t have been so inclined to shave your sons hair either.", "INFO - did your son put the gum in her hair on purpose? The quote \"they got into some gum and my daughter ended up with a huge wad of it stuck in her hair\" is a bit vague.", "YTA - what the actual fuck.  Even if your son did do it on purpose, he's a CHILD.  You've basically dragged him into the bathroom and shaved his hair off when you could have sat him down and discussed it with him and asked him to please apologise to his sister.  I would kind of class this as abusive actually.", "Dude, way to far. That is a form of corporal punishment, seems outright sadistic. And the child is 8, far from making rational decisions about putting gum in his sisters hair. YTA 150%, please get some professional help, because that sounds like an anger managemt issue.", "YTA.\n\nGood parenting isn't about revenge punishment. You, an adult, showed a complete lack of emotional regulation and a really mean spirit by your actions. You should have calmly but firmly let your son know that his actions were harmful and then given some thought as to how to proceed in an effective way that would allow him to acknowledge the harm he caused, ask for forgiveness, make reparations, etc.\n\nBut instead, you chose to be a bully (and I fully expect that it isn't the first time you've been one). Funny how some parents expect higher levels of decision-making and emotional regulation from their young children than they show themselves.\n\nAnd this assumes your son **intended** to put gum in her hair.\n\nIf he didn't intend to cause harm, then your actions were downright abusive.", "YTA\n\nAre you an asshole for abusing your son because he did an abusive act to a sibling? YES. At least your son has the excuse of being a child. You assaulted a child. You should seek counseling to help develop parenting skills and learn how to set boundaries and consequences appropriately. I understand parenting is hard but shearing the hair off a crying 8 year old is a monstrous abuse of your authority as a parent.  All you taught him is to fear you.", "YTA - if your child hit his sister, would you hit him? I\u2019m guessing (hoping) you would not.", "Oh you are the A S S H*** YTA. \n\nDon't teach your child that it's an eye for eye punishment. Teach them about the feelings and emotions your daughter is going through, how upset she is. \n\nHe is 8 years old he will probably be traumatised by this. \n\nYou took a simple sibling mistake and turned it into a ACE.

YOU acted out of getting 'revenge' for your daughter, instead of wondering why your son did what he did. You didn't try to understand at all (you still don't seem to care about why he might've done something like this, or if he's expressed other worrying behavior). \n\nHe's old enough to be able to communicate and ask him questions, and to work together on building that empathy muscle, and having consequences for actions. Maybe it could've been a choice: \n\n\\- cutting your hair\n\n\\- taking care of your little sister's hair (brushing, combing, washing, whatever)\n\n\\- helping little sis with other menial tasks (cleaning room, etc.)\n\n\\- taking away all sweets/treats (since he doesn't know how to enjoy them appropriately)\n\nLots of options, and I don't think that any appropriate punishment should come with the goal of creating depressed kids.", "YTA\n\nYou gotta be on the same page with your wife about this.

But apparently that\u2019s OK now because a 5 year old made you *feel better* about it. The fact you are not embarrassed having to explain or care what you did to an 8 year everywhere you go just confirms you as a sociopath.", "YTA. What a ridiculously cruel and over the top punishment. \n\nPeanut butter gets gum out of hair.", "Wow. He's 8 and you're an adult, a proper punishment would have been like \"no more gum until you're 9\". Of course YTA.", "YTA. This is considered physical abuse.", "YTA massively.

You know that, right?", "YTA\n\nYou're teaching your kids an eye for an eye. And all that really results in is angry, damaged adults.", "YTA. Cutting a child's hair like that (or any human's) is actually considered assault now in some jurisdictions. You should never come home and jump straight to punishment and punishment should never be \"an eye for an eye.\" \n\nDo you even know what the situation was? ~~Did your son maliciously shove a wad of gum in his sister's hair~~ (just saw that you say he did it on purpose but he's 8. Kids do things to see what will happen. If he's truly evil like you're painting him, you are just helping him develop his supervillain origin story) and did he truly understand the consequences? And now, instead of using her hair getting cut and her upset and embarrassment as a learning tool for him, you've just traumatized him. All he learned was to not trust you and it's even plausible that he resents his sister now because kids often transfer fear and strong negative feelings to those with less power over them.", "YTA you didn\u2019t teach your son any lesson but to fear you.

And he will hold it against you, which he should.", "YTA, you didn't do that to help him learn, you did it as revenge and didn't consult the other parent beforehand. You need to work on not giving punishments while angry. And you shouldn't be gloating that his sister laughed at him.", "YTA all you did was teach a little boy to be terrified of his dad.

I'm going to...deliberately wreck your hair!\"\n\nIt's not justice, it's hypocrisy. \n\nIt doesn't teach them \"hey, that was a thoughtless and inconsiderate thing to do\", it teaches them \"you're allowed to do cruel things to people if you're angry enough and you think they deserve it\". \n\nYou're reinforcing the idea that a) sometimes it's okay to deliberately be cruel/hurt people, especially if you're angry (which is nottttttt good for their future), and b) if you get angry, you might hurt them, you might do something to their body. You got angry, and you grabbed a child and forced them to be still and did something to them they didn't want, *because you were angry*. \n\nYou acted in anger, and did that *because* you were angry.  You did something cruel to your child because you were angry at them. You grabbed them and forced them and did something to their body they were begging you not to do. Because you were angry. That's fucking terrifying to a little kid, dude. \n\nYou made yourself someone scary. \n\nWhat they take away from the experience isn't some sort of understanding or empathy for their sister;what they take away from the experience is *fear*, and *betrayal*.\n\nYou betrayed your child.\n\nYou aren't going to feel like someone they wholly consider \"safe\" anymore.\n\nI really encourage you to step back and consider your responses and actions, not just in this situation.  Do you often act in anger? Do you justify your angry actions by saying they were deserved, or fair?  Do you find yourself sometimes being loud and angry to your family? \n\nAt the very very very VERY few along least, I really suggest you think about your parenting, and put in some rules, like no reacting until you've calmed down (like give yourself a time - an hour, or however long). No yelling, at all. Yelling is fucking terrifying, too. Unless you're yelling because they're about to step in front of a runaway train, you do *not* need to yell. No punishments that involve any part of their body, or causing them pain, discomfort, embarrassment.  If you can't come up with a better way to either a) explain it to them in a way that they won't do it again, or if necessary b) give non-harmful consequences (e.g. they can't watch a show for a day or something, yeesh), then you're sucking as a parent. \n\nAnd for God's sake, not without talking to your wife, it's really messed up that you did something so huge (and cruel) without even talking to her.  You can't march in and do something like, wtf??? \n\nBut man, the ACTUAL least you can do is start fixing yourself, seriously, preferably by getting help. You really need to work on yourself some.  Anger management is a VERY good place to start. Therapy if you can afford it/attain it. Because this isn't just about one incident, either. How did you become someone who reacts on anger by doing something like this? What type of parent are you as a whole? What type of partner, what type of person? This is an extreme thing to do, especially to a little kid, and it makes me worry about anger in the rest of your life. You need to address this anger, and you need to stop letting yourself use that anger as an excuse or a reason to be shitty and cruel to the people you love. \n\nThis is an extremely important moment, OP.  You have the chance to become a way better parent, someone your kids can trust and see as genuinely safe.  You can be courageous, here, and instead of denying that you might have an issue, you can be genuinely strong, genuinely loving, genuinely brave as heck, and work to build yourself into a better man.", "YTA you're an adult you can't have a sensible conversation about why that was wrong he's 8.", "YTA all day long.
