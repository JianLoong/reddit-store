The rule is simple, you have two weeks from the time you ask us (my wife and I), to think over the pros and cons of your request and after those two weeks you come back to us and we discuss the outcome of your thought process and if you're still set on it we will do it (within reason of course.) \n\nExample: When K was 12 she asked if she could get her ears pierced I told her to think it over and get back to us in two weeks. In those two weeks she did her research and decided she still wanted to get her ears pierced and so we went. \n\nAnyways back to the main story. H came to her mom and I and asked if she could get a tattoo with her friends. She'll be 18 in 6 months so we would still need to sign off for it. We're usually calm with how our kids want to express themselves whether it be a haircut/dye or their style choices but this was different, because it was permanent. I wasn't too fond of her getting a tattoo only because she was still a minor, but I reasoned with myself that she will be a legal adult soon so I wasn't too put out about it. As always I told her to think it over and get back to me in two weeks. This time however she blew up at me. \"Why do I still have to follow this stupid rule I'm almost an adult, none of my friends families ask them to wait two weeks. Gosh you treat us like a toddlers I don't get it.\" After that she ran to her room and didn't come out for the rest of the day. \n\nMy wife and I talked it over and she is firmly on H's side about it being a stupid rule in the first place and that she will be an adult soon so it wouldn't matter.

She sounds like she\u2019s rushing into this decision because all of her friends want to do it \u201cnow\u201d, which is why she\u2019s so upset about being told to wait.

I understand the point of the rule, and I think 2 weeks is probably a good time frame when the kids were younger.

I think that would be more reasonable.", "Well, I guess if she thinks waiting 2 weeks to think it over is treating her like a toddler, she could wait 6 months until she is an adult and doesn't need your permission.\n\nNTA - your daughter's reaction is that of a toddler.  Act like a toddler, get treated like a toddler.", "NAH.\n\nThis is not actually about the rule, or the tattoo. Like, straight up, I'm in my 30s. Taking two weeks to think about something major is my standard operating procedure! And there are a lot of decisions in my 20s I wish I'd taken two weeks to think about. This makes H feel like she's being treated like a kid because, in her family experience, the rule is associated with being treated like a kid - and there's a reason for that.\n\nH wants to be an adult. That means they want to explore their own boundaries and make their own decisions, like you taught them to (and good on you for that). And that means that they need the freedom to, yes, make decisions with permanent consequences.\n\nYou want to take care of your kid. And you want them to be independent. That's good! The thing is, 18 isn't a magical age barrier. It's just a number. H is old enough to go ask a judge for legal emancipation. What will take care of your kid best is gonna look different at this age (and will look different for each kid).\n\nPeople, including near-18-year-olds, don't blow up with \"you always treat me like a kid!\" over one rule. There's probably something else, and even if there isn't, it's worth listening to H anyways. Sit your daughter down, and ask her \"what else am I doing that makes you feel like a child? Tell me everything.\" And then listen. And when she's said her piece, say yours, and negotiate something that works for everyone. (Spoiler: it'll probably involve her getting the tattoo.)\n\nThat's how adults resolve conflicts and set boundaries. That's how young adult kids learn to just tell their parents \"this restriction bothers me and I need something to change\". It's a lot more important H learn this than she adhere to the rule.\n\nBest of luck to you and yours.", "NTA\n\nWhere I live is 18 for tattoo regardless of parental opinion.

Getting a tattoo is a life long decision (pretty much) and I don't think it's unreasonable to get her to think about it.

The work isn't the greatest and I regret it somewhat. I have 5 tattoos now and I'm just more picky on who does the work compared to letting some newbie do it. Lesson learned and I didn't harm anyone, so it's a win in my books!", "Hahahahahahaha! OMG, the tears are running down my face, this is so funny!

I get why she is annoyed since you seemingly do it so often but in this case, I agree with waiting. Probably even longer tbh.", "Nope! When I (21F) told my mom at 17 that I wanted to get a tattoo, her response was \"Wait until you're 18, and I'll take you to a place where we will get it done properly and safely, and I'll pay for it.\" The wait was worth it 100% and ended up being really helpful as I figured out where my chosen tat was going to go and how it was going to look/feel. \n\n\nYou're making the right decision making your daughter wait and stew on it for a few weeks before she permanently inks something on her body regardless of how old she is.

I get how it can feel like \"ugh, they don't think I'm grown up enough and can think things through in less than 2 weeks!\", but that's completely right! She's *not* grown up enough to make this huge decision on the spot, she absolutely should sit on this for 2 weeks because in that 2 weeks she can think of an idea that she really wants instead of just picking whatever flash art they have on the wall day of, she can also decide where she wants it in those 2 weeks, \"do I want it on my forearm or my ankle?\".", "Jesus when I decided to get a tattoo I waited 4 years, and I have still regretted it now and again.

Two weeks is hardly any time at all to think about a tattoo. Most of the time when you book an appointment you have to wait months anyway. And she's a minor, so she has to follow your rules.\n\nI'm fairly heavily tattooed and I don't really think minors should be getting tattoos in general, but if you're going to sign off on it (she'll be able to do what she wants when she's 18, as you say) then I definitely agree you should teach her to wait and think about a tattoo before she gets one.

I said in another comment that my first tattoo was a complete impulse buy.  That was 15 years ago and I love it.  I'm not saying that OP's daughter doesn't need to think about it.  I'm simply suggesting that OP maybe rethink this 2 week rule for his almost adult daughter.  He's obviously spent a good many years instilling this thought process in his children.  Maybe it's time to let the one who's almost an adult use it on her own, without him regulating it?", "NGL this sounds like an awesome tattoo", "I wouldn't even call that a tantrum. Being frustrated because her father is still treating her like a little kid? Absolutely.  She'll be 18 in half a year at this point its time to actually start talking to her, hearing her thoughts and not just kicking the ball down the field.", "Cost me 280 lol", "My stupid tattoo at 18 was SpongeBob riding a seahorse on my cave I love hate it, I think it's fugly but a good reminder to think things through before you go permanent. My then GF now wife got a similar one on her ribs and covered it up with roses.\n\n\nEdit wife*", "I don\u2019t disagree with maybe relaxing the rule. \n\nBut how she handled that conversation shows incredible immaturity on her part. She threw a childlike temper tantrum because she didn\u2019t get her way. \n\nThey correct response on her part would have been \u201cdad, I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do here getting us to think about this, but I feel like I\u2019m ready to make my own decisions and I\u2019d like to get rid of the two week rule\u201d personally, I would have agreed, got rid of the two week rule, and allowed her to get the tattoo if she spoke like this. \n\nOtherwise, if the law says she needs permission because as a minor she\u2019s not considered capable of making a decision like this and legally she doesn\u2019t have the autonomy to actually make any decision about a tattoo, then I would have said no and made her wait until she was 18 because that response just tells me she\u2019s way too immature to make a permanent life decision. But maybe I\u2019m petty like that idk", "I can assure you it's not lol", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80\n\nH: can I get a tattoo?\nOP: wait two weeks as usual? \nH: OH MY GOD WHY ARE YOU TREATING US LIKE TODDLERS IM ABOUT TO BE 18 AND AN ADULT LIKE WHY DO YOU THIS STUPID RULE IT ISNT FAAAAAIR \n\nSounds like a tantrum to me. And you\u2019re triggered. God bless.\n\nEdited for misspelling.", "You're NTA. Isn't it ironic when someone has a screaming tantrum and stomps off because they think they're being treated like a toddler. That could be evidence that she Isn't mature enough to get a tattoo yet.", "NTA. \n\nI will tell this to anyone who will listen. I wanted my first tattoo when I was 19, and my brother gave me the single best piece of advice on the first tattoo. Sit on the idea for a year. If you still want it, go for it. \n\nI did not still want it a year later. I now have several and I love them, and I don\u2019t wait so long to get one now because 1) I\u2019m now in my mid-twenties 2) I have a much better sense of what I like out of styles and artists.\n\nTwo weeks is nothing if it\u2019s something she thinks she wants for the rest of her life.", "NTA. This is a good and reasonable rule. It's short enough to allow for reflection without being punitive, long enough to avoid regretful impulsivity. It's a really good way of teaching delayed gratification, because it's not a blanket \"no\" but a \"sleep on it awhile\". I guess she just decided that she wants to wait six months instead of two weeks for that tattoo now.", "NTA. Too bad you don\u2019t live in MN. A minor absolutely can\u2019t get a tattoo until 18. Parents can\u2019t sign for it either. I personally believe all states needs to be this way. I think your system is great. It is teaching them to think things through instead of making rash decisions. I don\u2019t think you should stop it personally.", "NTA and I definitely need to start implementing this rule for me and my family", "NTA. If she can't wait two weeks, she doesn't need a tattoo. I would have straight up told her that's an adult decision that she gets to do herself as an adult. \n\nI also wonder just how quick she thinks a good artist has openings. Mine was booked 6 months out and took 3 sessions and the better part of a year to finish.", "NTA. She literally threw a tantrum like a toddler so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA  if she won't take the time to do what every has always needed to then she certainly isn't mature enough to get a tatoo.", "I\u2019m sure you know this already, but just to check: what state are you in? Because in some states, someone under 18 cannot get a tattoo, even with a parent or guardian\u2019s permission.\n\nBut I gotta say NTA because 2 weeks is completely reasonable to think about something you\u2019ll have forever.", "NTA.  Evidently the rule is needed, otherwise she would have talked to you about how the rule helped her become the young adult she is, and she had already thought it through before approaching you.", "NTA - I work in radiology and post of the counsel checks for the scan is \"do you have permanent tattoos or peircings\" every single week I get a patient saying - yep,  I was young and stupid.  I wish I didn't. \n\nIf she still wants one in two weeks then she'll have had time to think of a good design as well!", "NTA. While I might be an outlier, I waited 3 years to get my first tattoo, and even now still think, wait, and budget for any new ink. Two weeks to let the idea simmer is nothing. If anything, it gives time to research the tattoo shop and artists they have on staff, as they usually specialize in different styles.", "NTA \n\nI have a ton of tattoos. I've thought and rethought every single one of them before getting them.  Where on my body to get them, what shop, what artist, best aftercare products, style of design, everything.  As a grown ass adult I always think it over.  It's not a 'toddler' rule.  \n\nHeck, I do the same with Amazon splurge purchases--stick it in my Amazon cart and think about it till the end of the week. Saved me from a LOT of unnecessary trivial spending.", "Nta at ALL. I took years to decide what I wanted ultimately . My whole life I knew I'd be tatted on my whole body lol. I waited until last year and only have 6 small medium tattoos and one is on my neck lmaooo. I've gotten these because I KNOW I want room for more thinking. Like ultimately full body but it's been YEARS of planning placement and sentiment .Most of what I loved I haven't gotten .Because I waited a couple months took a second look and changed my mind. I love all my tattoos but yeah.  Two weeks isn't a long time to mentally prep what's going on your body forever lol. Some people really don't care and love their shitty tattoos and know full well they're shitty. She's probably not that type tho lol. I'm 25 btw. So waited until 24.", "I the she really needs to see all of the responses from actual adults responding to your post. Her behavior suggests that she was not thinking like an adult. You too should be asking her questions. How will she, as an adult, pay for the tattoo? Tattoos are not cheap. Has she picked a licensed and well respected tattoo artist? Does she know what type of tattoo she wants? Does she know where she will have it placed? Has she looked into the after care so she doesn't end up with needing a doctor later? How will she handle it if she has to wait the six months until she is 18? Does she recognize that her behavior was immature when you brought up the two week rule? Does she realize that getting a tattoo because her friends are doing it is not only immature but she is more likely to regret it later? Your wife needs to hear those last questions too. The only reasonable exception to the friends thing, that comes to mind, would be if one of them had a fatal diagnosis.", "Honestly this would just make me ask my parents at the first impulse, just to start the 2 week clock. Then fully research it. Rather than the better way of going to my parents with my full thoughts and asking for their input or if I forgot anything. Your intent was good when they were younger but you need to evolve as they get older.\n\nYTA", "It's also a pretty big deal in terms of aftercare, and bad tat aftercare can cause some pretty serious infections.  So it's not just a body modification but it's something that if you don't take care of it exactly right...could really eff you up for a long time.", "She literally threw a tantrum. Shes clearly not mature enough for a tattoo.", "2 full weeks, at least, is actually a good time frame for this. Not to think about whether she wants it, but to take plenty of time to figure out where, how big, what exactly she wants, etc. But she threw a temper tantrum about it like a child...", "I mean...the GOOD artists book out months in advance.  I'm pretty sure I could get an apprentice done walk in any day of the week. I'm just too much of a tat snob at this point to hand over my valuable real estate to an artist whose work and style I don't really love...and have to wait months for.", "So glad you had his back and told him to reconsider! It is so hard because the tattooer is an artist and they spent time creating their designs and you feel like you are insulting them, but it is something on your body and you should love it! The bad thing is when the tattoo artist deviates from their design! My sister's did this and she hated the add ons", "She definitely needs the two weeks to make sure she wants to put a permanent mark on her body.", "I thought about my first one a year before I went for it", "I wouldn't say responsible adults take longer than 2 weeks because that's silly but I agree an adult usually thinks things through.", "*agrees in having half a word tattooed on her bum at 26 at a house party at 3am*\n\nWill she make dumb decisions? Yes. Are the parents teaching her not to make those? Also yes.", "Right? Professionals tell you to think about what tattoo you want and where and then wait a year. If you still want it, get it. Because they are permanent! If you won't still want it in a year, you shouldn't get it", "So\u2026 if you received a job offer with some pretty great pros and some pretty bad cons\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t take a few weeks to think that through?\n\nHonestly curious\u2026", "Our minds are different at at that age! My first tattoo at 18 was scooby doo, I don\u2019t hate the tatoo because I still today love scooby doo, just now that I\u2019m older just wish I did something more meaningful like my other tattoos.", "Each situation is different. Odds are pretty great a job isn't going to wait 3 weeks let alone 6 months for you to decide so there's that. Either way not all decisions need a full 2 weeks to decide either. I'm definitely all for thinking things through (especially big ones) but it's hardly irresponsible to not take weeks to make a decision either.", "I think your 2 week rule as enforced for things that really don\u2019t need it for teenagers may end up making her rebel by making rash decisions when it should take thought. Based on how immaturely she reacted I\u2019d tell her to pay for her own when she was 18", "Developmentally, teens are similar to toddlers. Wanting to explore a wider world than they had previously been exposed to. Big, big feelings. \"No, mom, I can do it MYSELF.\"\n\nYou did the right thing even if your teen was pissed. It's your job at this stage to set reasonable limits, & the teens job to hate them,l. This all makes it less painful when they leave hahaha.\n\nHonestly your daughter should appreciate that it's even on the table. If I had gotten a tattoo at age 18, my dad would have kicked me out of the house, even though I hadn't yet finished high school.", "NTA. The rule is awesome. Wish my parents did something like this too. Tell your daughter if she hates the rule, wait  6 months and get the tattoo without asking you then.", "NTA if it's going to be on her body forever, what's the rush?", "NTA", "Given her other option is waiting six months, the two week rule is generous. Kiddo did not think this through. \n\nNTA.", "OP you are NTA because legally you're still responsible for her.  If something were to potentially go wrong since you'd have to sign off on it, then there's no reason why she can't wait the 2 weeks.  Once she's 18 she has free reign, but she's still under your roof and your responsibility, so keep this in mind.", "NTA - I used to have a rule that I had to give blood at least once between tattoos which meant a full year (at the time). This saved me a lot of grief (and I still have some truly beautiful tattoos). 2 weeks is more than reasonable and it\u2019s good practice for her in the real world.", "I wish as an adult I followed the 2 week rule before I made any decision. Would have saved me so much stress. NTA OP.", "NTA\u2014yes she\u2019s almost an adult but she shouldn\u2019t be making a permanent decision if she\u2019s still behaving this way. When I decided I wanted a tattoo at 18 (21 now and still haven\u2019t gotten it since I\u2019m pregnant) I thought long about what design I wanted, what I wanted it to symbolize, and then found an artist on TikTok whose designs I loved and paid her to draw up designs that perfectly matched what I was looking to get. I\u2019ll definitely be getting the tattoo after I\u2019m cleared to get one, but I definitely needed more than two weeks to make my final decision and I\u2019m grateful for it. You\u2019re teaching your children valuable decision making skills and it\u2019ll definitely be something they appreciate in the future.", "NTA. Even adults can have impulse issues. This is actually a pretty good process to consider for long term or expensive decisions.", "NTA. I think this two week rule is great esp in decision making. Thats a good skill to have to make the right decision. Teaches you patience as well.", "Nta. I found a tattoo I loved at 16 and didn\u2019t get it until I turned 19 because I knew it would be permanent and I wouldn\u2019t be able to turn back time.

I wanted a tattoo at 17 and my dad took me to a tattoo shop. She drew me a design and I got it done. 8 years later I still love it. But that isn't usually how that goes and I know that. So take it from the kid who got a tattoo at 17 with 30 minutes of thought, good job dad, stay firm on this", "NTA. This is a sensible rule everyone should follow when making big decisions. It gives you time to research and weigh the pros and cons, and to really explore how you feel about something. You are not treating them like toddlers, you are treating them like adults. Keep up the good parenting.", "NTA, I don't think that's a bad rule, honestly. Also, I ran off and got two tattoos basically right after I turned 18, and I did no research and not ever really any forethought and both my tattoos turned out shit.

Your kid has practiced your 2 week rule their whole life. She is 17! Let her be a little impulsive! Let her make a big leap! She has done your think-through way.

The guy added in feathers. Even when he \"fixed\" it, my son wasn't happy with it. \n\nMy first tattoo, while I love it, I regret the placement of it. Eventually, I'll probably have it covered and put that design somewhere else. Anything on the body, whether it's ink, a piercing, whatever should have serious thought and consideration into it.
