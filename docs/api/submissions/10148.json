Ever since they were little I've tried to give them the opportunity to (not sure how to put this) make their own decisions/think for themselves? But what I really wanted to teach them was to think through their decision before making it final. So I implemented a two week rule. The rule is simple, you have two weeks from the time you ask us (my wife and I), to think over the pros and cons of your request and after those two weeks you come back to us and we discuss the outcome of your thought process and if you're still set on it we will do it (within reason of course.) \n\nExample: When K was 12 she asked if she could get her ears pierced I told her to think it over and get back to us in two weeks. In those two weeks she did her research and decided she still wanted to get her ears pierced and so we went. \n\nAnyways back to the main story. H came to her mom and I and asked if she could get a tattoo with her friends. She'll be 18 in 6 months so we would still need to sign off for it. We're usually calm with how our kids want to express themselves whether it be a haircut/dye or their style choices but this was different, because it was permanent. I wasn't too fond of her getting a tattoo only because she was still a minor, but I reasoned with myself that she will be a legal adult soon so I wasn't too put out about it. As always I told her to think it over and get back to me in two weeks. This time however she blew up at me. \"Why do I still have to follow this stupid rule I'm almost an adult, none of my friends families ask them to wait two weeks. Gosh you treat us like a toddlers I don't get it.\" After that she ran to her room and didn't come out for the rest of the day. \n\nMy wife and I talked it over and she is firmly on H's side about it being a stupid rule in the first place and that she will be an adult soon so it wouldn't matter. She also said that if she doesn't like it then it will be her mistake and she will learn from it. I want to stand firm on the 2 week rule, but now my wife is saying I'm being too strict.

She sounds like she\u2019s rushing into this decision because all of her friends want to do it \u201cnow\u201d, which is why she\u2019s so upset about being told to wait.

I understand the point of the rule, and I think 2 weeks is probably a good time frame when the kids were younger.  But, as you said, she's almost an adult, do you really think she still needs 2 full weeks to think about this decision?  Do you, as an adult, take 2 full weeks to think through every decision you have to make?  I'm going to guess no.  So, maybe you could try shortening the time frame to, at most, 1 week?  I think that would be more reasonable.\n\nEdit: Because I've gotten a ton of replies about this, and I'm tired of saying the same thing over and over again: I'm in no way saying his daughter *shouldn't* take 2 weeks to think about getting a tattoo.  I'm saying that, first of all, we don't know whether she already has taken the 2 weeks, because according to the OP, OP didn't even ask her.  Also, OP has spent a good many years instilling this good process in his children.  Maybe it's time for OP to let his almost adult child use this process under her own steam, without his regulation.  She will have to do it that way soon, anyway.", "Well, I guess if she thinks waiting 2 weeks to think it over is treating her like a toddler, she could wait 6 months until she is an adult and doesn't need your permission.\n\nNTA - your daughter's reaction is that of a toddler.  Act like a toddler, get treated like a toddler.", "NAH.\n\nThis is not actually about the rule, or the tattoo. Like, straight up, I'm in my 30s. Taking two weeks to think about something major is my standard operating procedure! And there are a lot of decisions in my 20s I wish I'd taken two weeks to think about. This makes H feel like she's being treated like a kid because, in her family experience, the rule is associated with being treated like a kid - and there's a reason for that.\n\nH wants to be an adult. That means they want to explore their own boundaries and make their own decisions, like you taught them to (and good on you for that). And that means that they need the freedom to, yes, make decisions with permanent consequences.\n\nYou want to take care of your kid. And you want them to be independent. That's good! The thing is, 18 isn't a magical age barrier. It's just a number. H is old enough to go ask a judge for legal emancipation. What will take care of your kid best is gonna look different at this age (and will look different for each kid).\n\nPeople, including near-18-year-olds, don't blow up with \"you always treat me like a kid!\" over one rule. There's probably something else, and even if there isn't, it's worth listening to H anyways. Sit your daughter down, and ask her \"what else am I doing that makes you feel like a child? Tell me everything.\" And then listen. And when she's said her piece, say yours, and negotiate something that works for everyone. (Spoiler: it'll probably involve her getting the tattoo.)\n\nThat's how adults resolve conflicts and set boundaries. That's how young adult kids learn to just tell their parents \"this restriction bothers me and I need something to change\". It's a lot more important H learn this than she adhere to the rule.\n\nBest of luck to you and yours.", "NTA\n\nWhere I live is 18 for tattoo regardless of parental opinion.

Getting a tattoo is a life long decision (pretty much) and I don't think it's unreasonable to get her to think about it.

The work isn't the greatest and I regret it somewhat. I have 5 tattoos now and I'm just more picky on who does the work compared to letting some newbie do it. Lesson learned and I didn't harm anyone, so it's a win in my books!", "Hahahahahahaha! OMG, the tears are running down my face, this is so funny!  She doesn't want to be treated like a toddler, but she acts like one by blowing up when she didn't get her way, ran away to her room, and didn't come out until the end of the day. LMAO!\n\n18 may be the age of majority, but it in no way makes one an adult, just by existing on the earth for those number of years.\n\nShe's too immature to realize that the permanence of a tattoo will outlive the person she thinks she is now.  But, you know, it is O so important to be cool.  lol\n\nNTA", "NTA in this case because it's a major, essentially permanent thing. I get why she is annoyed since you seemingly do it so often but in this case, I agree with waiting. Probably even longer tbh.", "Nope! When I (21F) told my mom at 17 that I wanted to get a tattoo, her response was \"Wait until you're 18, and I'll take you to a place where we will get it done properly and safely, and I'll pay for it.\" The wait was worth it 100% and ended up being really helpful as I figured out where my chosen tat was going to go and how it was going to look/feel. \n\n\nYou're making the right decision making your daughter wait and stew on it for a few weeks before she permanently inks something on her body regardless of how old she is.

I get how it can feel like \"ugh, they don't think I'm grown up enough and can think things through in less than 2 weeks!\", but that's completely right! She's *not* grown up enough to make this huge decision on the spot, she absolutely should sit on this for 2 weeks because in that 2 weeks she can think of an idea that she really wants instead of just picking whatever flash art they have on the wall day of, she can also decide where she wants it in those 2 weeks, \"do I want it on my forearm or my ankle?\".", "Jesus when I decided to get a tattoo I waited 4 years, and I have still regretted it now and again.

Two weeks is hardly any time at all to think about a tattoo. Most of the time when you book an appointment you have to wait months anyway. And she's a minor, so she has to follow your rules.\n\nI'm fairly heavily tattooed and I don't really think minors should be getting tattoos in general, but if you're going to sign off on it (she'll be able to do what she wants when she's 18, as you say) then I definitely agree you should teach her to wait and think about a tattoo before she gets one. And please, for the love of god, help her do some research into good artists instead of just going to a random place at the last minute.

I\u2019d tell her she\u2019s right. That 2 weeks isn\u2019t an appropriate amount of time to consider a tattoo. 6 months is.", "NTA\n\nI don't think you treat them like toddlers. You actually treat them like adults. Making them understand not to rush into big decisions without considering all the outcomes. It is a good rule for everyone. Maybe 2 weeks is too long depending on the subject, but still a good approach. \n\nEvery action has consequences. That includes not taking any action, which is something many adults fail to understand.\n\nEven when I have to send a big email if it is not urgent I write it. Keep it for a day, read it again and then decide if it is a good idea to send it or not. \n\nYou have probably already done it but try to explain why the rule. Rushing into decisions often leads into regrets but at the same time you need a balance. There are times when you need to make quick decisions. It depends on the situation.", "NTA and that's a good rule.", "Fr", "Given how she\u2019s acting, 2 weeks might not be enough. Guaranteed if she gets the tattoo and hate it after 2 days she\u2019ll complain her parents should be paying to remove it", "With a piercing, no. I wait a couple days and then come back to the idea. Those can be removed and the hole closed up. No damage done in typical cases.\n\nBut something permanent, like a tattoo, or a large purchase. Yes two weeks is good. Honestly, for some things, two weeks isn\u2019t enough time. Most tattoos people regret are the tattoos they decided on one day and got the very next day. If you think about it, most people decide one day they want a tattoo and research and conceptualize the tattoo they\u2019re wanting for weeks, even months. This is them thinking on the decision to get the tattoo or not.\n\nOP should have said what do you want to get. If daughter told OP, he then could have said ok think on it for two weeks. Really think if that design is something you will be satisfied with for the rest of your life. Also, research tattoo removal and pricing and then come back to me. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if OP\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t really have a clue as to what she\u2019s wanting and just wants a tattoo because one of her friends got one.", "A tattoo is kind of a big decision.\n\nHell once I decide what I want a tattoo to be I'd say I spend 2 weeks trying to choose an artist.", "Maybe not for most decisions, but a tattoo needs more than 2 weeks of consideration imo. The tattoo I have now had at least a couple of months of consideration behind it. A group tattoo with friends before the age of 18 sounds like an awful idea to me, but that's up to the kid, I still think she should think LONG and hard about it", "LMAOOOOOO RIGHT", "Or dad can get over himself and his stupid rule. He ain't accomplishing squat with this silly rule.", "And she's ain't accomplishing squat by throwing a tantrum over it. If she was so tired of the rule she could have sat down with her parents and had a productive conversation about it.", "Nothing in this person response comes off as being triggered. You on the other hand sound triggered.", "She threw a \"tantrum\" over this rule because I can bet dad is being more ridiculous than he likes to admit over this rule. Most people don't throw tantrums unless they finally hit there breaking point. Mom is on her side which I am assuming dad is over the top with this rule. \n\nLike I said dad can get over himself and his stupid rules.", "Haha! This is a great rule. My sister had a sunburst tattoo around her belly button. She regretted this just about 1 second after she popped out her first child.", "The personal advice someone may give you will often deviate from the sales advice they will give you. \ud83d\ude0f", "Had a roomie who had a friend. That girl had some type of cartoon character and some words on her stomach. When she showed off her baby bump I burst out laughing just imagining what that was going to look like after childbirth. Moved out before she had the kid so I can only imagine.", "Haha, oh dear! Have your ever seen a balloon when it's almost fully deflated, but not quite? They get these little columns of wrinkles, like wrinkled hyphens stacked one on top of the other? This is what my sister's tattoo looked like. \n\nEach ray of sunshine was a line of squishy horizonal wrinkles thrusting outward.\n\nMaybe a tattoo of words will just look like it rained on someone's very poorly written cursive. \ud83d\ude02", "Age doesn't make one an adult. She reacted very immature and doesn't seem to understand the concept of thinking before acting.\nI love that rule actually. Hopefully she will appreciate your parenting more once she is older", "NTA. Now she gets to wait 6 months!", "Youre generous giving her two weeks to consider something very permanent, I personally give myself six months to consider if I want a tattoo or not before I can go ahead and do it. If you want something permanent on yourself then you will obviously want it on you in six months time. If not, then you saved yourself something stupid.", "NTA i taught my kids the research stuff carefully, draw up pro and cons lists and take time to think it over. Also to always have a plan B. Whatever it is you think you want will still be there. My kids are in their 30's now and are still doing it. No one is too old to think over impotant decisions it guards against stupid mistakes.", "NTA, I was raised by a marine and we did a similar system and my brother and I turned out to be respectful", "If she is going to act like that she can wait till she turns 18 then. NTA", "NTA - LOL, ok skip the 2 weeks, say no directly 3:)", "Nah, even adults should follow the two week rule. That\u2019s a PLT.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because this isn\u2019t a temporary decision. Tattoos are for life. As someone who is pretty tattooed I think 2 weeks is too short. I\u2019ve had friends come to me about tattoos they wanted and I\u2019ve always told them to wait 6 months at least and if they still want it then get it. More than one of my friends has changed their mind within that timeframe and thanked me for telling them to wait. If she\u2019s throwing a tantrum about it then she clearly isn\u2019t mature enough to get a tattoo.", "I decided I wanted a tattoo at 16, it took me until I was in my late 30s because I wanted to be sure and then I wanted to find something that was just exactly what I wanted. I\u2019m 50 and planning 2 more both with a lot of meaning to me.   \n\n\none of the reasons I waited was because my dad was (still is) against tattoos. I\u2019m glad I waited as it has so much more meaning than if I\u2019d just gotta one with my friends \n\nNTA. her options are wait 2 weeks or 6 months.", "NTA. I had many ideas of things I wanted tattooed on my body and thankfully I had pretty strict parents as I now would absolutely cringe if I'd gone through with almost any of those ideas. Taking time to think things through isn't a childish approach at all - it's what any reasonable adult does. Throwing a tantrum and spending the day hiding in a room isn't really adult behaviour however.", "NTA \n\nI do think you need to revise how you do this. Talk to both of them, your wife first than H, about why you started this rule. When talking to H have her give the pro/con discussion now for the tattoo.\n\nAfter that\n\nExplain to her you have been treating her as an adult and not a toddler. Ask her what makes this rule wrong in her mind, and how would she change it? Discuss it and treat her and the others accordingly. Ask her if her behavior helped her or hurt her?", "If I started having tattoos at 18 I would have a bunch of awful tattoos", "This was my thought as well. Tattoos are a permanent thing and putting in the thought of exactly what she wants, where she wants, color or not could absolutely take a while. Even if she's been thinking about it for a while in the next few weeks she may want tweaks to it in some way.\n\nAt this point if OP and their wife are paying I'd offer it as a birthday gift. Whether it's six months or 2 weeks that's a fairly short time to think about a permanent mark to their skin in the grand scheme of things.", "Well she could have had a discussion with OP like an adult instead of running to her room like a toddler.", "I totally agree with you (even if personally I am against tatoos). I have not found in the post for how long the girl was considering her tattoo - could it be that she thought about it for more than two weeks, just kept her thoughts to herself?", "I actually use the two week rule myself for purchases. Sometimes even longer, trying to really get a good feel of whether or not it's a good idea to get whatever product i want. I'm 29, so definitely not a \"childish\" thing.", "My personal rule is that I get a tattoo when I decide what design and where on my body, and those two things do not change for an entire year. I've followed this rule since I was 16yo and 22 years later have zero tattoos. While I love them on other people, I, personally, am too fickle for a tattoo. \n\nMy husband and I now 'tattoo rule' big life decisions. While it may not always be a year, we take a lot of time to think through pros/cons of life altering things. It has worked really well for us because when the decision is the right one it time doesn't change your mind.", "It really isn't that long at all. I have tattoos I regret and maybe if I wasn't so impulsive, I wouldn't have them.\n\nAnd the laser removal hurts like a b... :("]}
