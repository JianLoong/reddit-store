They certainly don't ask the bride to chip in after a surprise celebration for which the bride had no input.\n\nHonestly, Kate sounds like she wanted to be a big shot and do something fancy, and now she's regretting the outlay of money. What should have happened is that she planned your shower, in concert with your other bridesmaids. They should have set a reasonable budget for what they could afford. If Kate went rogue, that's Kate's problem.\n\nEtiquette-wise, the mothers of both the bride and groom aren't supposed to throw the shower, because that's like asking for gifts for their own kids.

That's a cost that is usually split between the people throwing the party.

Works well in most aspects of life, including when you throw a party.", "NTA. \"Doing something nice for someone\" is not a justification.

Why can't they bear any responsibility for their own actions? \n\nYou didn't ask for this. You didn't plan it or need it, it was a surprise for you. To be asked to pay for it is an absolute cheek.

I desperately need to know her answer, reasoning and why she thinks her behavior is acceptable. \n\nImo, she isn\u2019t a friend if she\u2019s going to treat you this way.

She sprung this event on you without your knowledge or involvement, you are not responsible for her bill.

Sounds like SIL wanted a boat trip and thought this was a good excuse.", "NTA Love how she's saying she did something nice for you and this is how we treat her. Using that logic she would mean you did something nice for yourself if you are expected to foot the bill.", "Surprise party? No! Surprise invoice! Lol NTA.", "NTA. She surprised you with a gift.

This should have been planned with you knowing that you had to pay. \n\nYou owe her nothing.", "NTA - If she expected you to contribute then you should have had a say in the what was spent. She has no right to spend your money without your input and consent.", "NTA. Your new SIL is quite entitled. I\u2019d have your husband tell his mother to rein her in and stop ruining your honeymoon.", "NTA. Your SIL doesn\u2019t seem to understand the concept of a surprise party. Maybe she also gives birthday gifts then charges the recipient for them?", "NTA. This is a neat way to get some of your wedding gift money spent on herself and her wishes. Do it as a wedding event, then demand repayment after you collect your wedding gifts and are all grateful and joyful.", "NTA.  Wow.", "NTA- unless you agreed to pay for part of the bridal shower that is on her and the bridal party anyway.", "NTA. Kate is wicked tacky. If she couldn't swing it she should have asked the other bridesmaids and moms to help. You should never ask the person of honor to pay for their surprise party", "SLPT: low on money? Do a surprise gift for a friend, and then demand a payment back!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Anyone would pick no surprise than a surprise that later brings baggage.   Most likely she never planned to ask you to pay but now needs money.  It might be too late but just saying no might not be the best.  Starting with, we will talk when we get back.  Then if she brings it up again, say you can't afford it now with the wedding.   Have a conversation with your husband around.  Or just pay it to save the relationship.  Buy its not you.", "NTA. But for the sake of family harmony, and in case SIL is seriously strapped for cash, you could agree to contribute a share of the expense. She's wrong for asking, but if this is creating a financial hardship for her she may have had no choice. Congrats on the wedding!
