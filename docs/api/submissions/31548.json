Even if you didn't then a dress with chameleons on it is memorable in itself so not surprised you recall it.  \n\nPerhaps in the future don't bring up the details but be more vague.  For example instead of saying 'We met on 5th Jan at the Red Lion Pub when we were out with Daves family, you were drinking Prosecco and were wearing a green summer dress with chameleons on it' how about  just saying 'We met once at the pub a while ago when we were out with Dave'\n\nNothing wrong with recalling the details but it is a bit odd to bring them up and I can understand why someone may feel a little uncomfortable.

But one thing I can tell you for sure: no matter how pretty she is, she's been stalked before.  \nIt's not weird to have a great memory, but out of context, for someone who has been socially taught that they are meant to be victimised more and who have actually experienced weird behaviours, it can raise alarms.\n\nAs a woman, I've been follow on foot by car numerous times. I've had guys come to me at the university library to tell me that they'd been watching me and found me fascinating - that guy then proceeded to stalk me for four months. I've had people take the wrong train just to keep asking my number. After a while, you just are more aware of red flags, and some dude remembering what you drink and what you wore nine months ago that's definitely one.\n\nIt doesn't make you an AH the first time you do it, just a blind man in a male society. But in the future, you might want to read people's reactions more before you start bragging, and be quick to offer a \"sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out, I just have a good memory, I can't help remembering things like that.\"", "NTA  although you could have coached her to exolain you have a photographic memory before you said it, then perhaps get your mutual friend to vouch for you.

I know two people in that category that still are skittish. If this lady had it could explain why it freaked her out.\n\nHowever, continue to use your gifts! I find it fascinating!", "NTA.

So it seems like maybe most or at best half of the conversations you're memorizing our conversations others are having with each other that do not include you. Basically like you've gone to a party and you stand in the corner watching everyone but with a high memory recall.\n\nMany people will feel unnerved when someone they don't talk to comes up with specific key details about them. **Next time if these details did not come from a conversation you had with the person do not share them.**", "[deleted]", "NTA. She didn't remember you and she was embarrassed that you remembered her so clearly. Maybe she will pay more attention to the people she meets multiple times. Calling you a creep was uncalled for. And the hosts partner defending her seems like their misguided way of trying to keep the peace. Just ignore it and let it go. Keep doing you.", "ESH\n\nPeople tend to get uncomfortable when someone remembers something about themselves that they don't recall especially if its a very precise detail. Now its human nature that there are things that an outsider will remember about us that we will never physically recall ourselves. It can be a bit of a shock as an adult to realize that. Some people never reach that self-awareness.\n\nNow women tend to be more hyper aware of odd behavior and take it as a negative red flag rather than just a benign personality trait. It was wrong of her to immediately jump to the conclusion that you are creepy and especially wrong of her to start making comments about it at the party. Thank god your friend shut it down and stood up for you.\n\nHowever, if you're old enough to be having house warming parties etc, you are old enough to know that after she had confessed to not remembering you, you countering back with a very specific detail that she had no physical way of remembering is going to set off stranger danger flags. So its a little your fault for clarifying that you just happen to have a great memory and its not anything specifically about her that made you remember her in great detail.\n\nBut boy howdy that austism/ADHD recall has bit me in the butt many a time too.", "NAH verging on NTA\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, and I can also see why she might have been put off by the comment.\n\nTelling the hosts you were a creep was a bit much, though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But if I met you once and you remember the clothes I was wearing, I would definitely think you were obsessed with me.", "I think that it is unusual for someone to have such a good memory about those specific kind of facts, they tend to be things people dating or good friends or something stood out might recall but not in general life. \n\nIt might be that those replying that it isn\u2019t unusual may also have exceptional memories for these type of data and there\u2019s a whole lot of talented folk out there!\n\nEdit : Thankyou for telling me\nto  \u201cgrow up \u201c . Rather unnecessary and missing the point. Creepiness isn\u2019t always in the intention,  it is often in how it was perceived at that time in that context.

Terrible memory for most things, little details stick for some reason.", "It\u2019s not creepy, the female acquaintance was taken aback he recalled her exact clothing and drink preferences after a short conversation a year ago in a party setting.  And in some circumstances and contexts it could be interpreted as creepy depending on context and how the person felt. We can\u2019t argue with that lady as it was how she felt which included a bit of surprise and confusion about it. \n\nI think people are just saying how they  could see how that female may have  interpreted it as unusual & wondered about it. \n\nI would have too;  that is because generally many  women have had a lifetime of  experiences where they have learnt to be mindful and  take extra precautions as a female. Or anyone who might have other vulnerabilities might also do so. It\u2019s not reflective of OP and his actions or intentions.\n\nEdit \nI can\u2019t go back upwards to top to edit my first line. I meant paying attention to people you talk to is not creepy in itself as you describe it but you were not that female and like many women she may have learnt to be careful on guard even, when  men comment in an unexpected personal way.

When you proved how well you remembered her, that tipped the balance further. \n\nIt didn\u2019t make you an AH, but if you wanted to help her feel more at ease, you could have offered more details about YOURSELF. \u201cI met you on such-and-such night, it was your first time, but I had been attending the meetups X amount of time, and we talked about subject XYZ.\n\nThat might jog her memory (or not), while putting things a little more in balance by giving her some information about you. From her perspective, you were a total stranger who knew intimate details about her. Even saying, \u201cI remember you told me that you hate artificial caramel flavor,\u201d is softer than informing her that she hates it. The first is sharing a recollection, and the second is accessing a mental database of info about her. It\u2019s subtle, but makes a difference in how others feel about you knowing and remembering things about them.", "To me it was how you responded to the lady that had me suspecting. Did you say you knew her from the coffee group? If not, I can understand why she was creeped out. Especially since you've said you're on the quieter side.

Maybe it would be relevant to add to your post, but maybe it would just attract ableism. Either way, I consider it relevant information because I could see how in this situation you wouldn't have picked up the cue that this came off weird. \n\nNAH, you didn't do anything inherently wrong and I can also see how it would've creeped her out. Usually when someone is saying they don't recognize you, the important information to give *first* would be where you've previously met, not the intimate details you remembered about her. After telling her where you've met it probably wouldn't seem as weird to mention what you remembered her saying about the caramel, especially if she insisted you didn't meet at these coffee meets, then it's relevant info as you could use it to prove it to her. You just came in with the intimate details too early without telling her where you met first, so without the context of the coffee meets she's just looking at this guy who she doesn't recognize, who she either could have met or could be *stalking* her, but she didn't know because you didn't mention to her how you met, just that you knew personal details about her.\n\nAgain, you didn't do anything inherently wrong, your timing in this situation is off. I understand some people are impressed with this skill but others may be confused or creeped out. It's worth noting that many women do have previous histories of being stalked, it may not seem common but like 50% of the female coworkers I've had in my life have been stalked at some point, so even if you did not come off maliciously, if she's had negative experiences prior she might already be on guard.", "Bless you, me too, and as I was reading this I was thinking 'this is the most autistic post I've ever read'. I realise you were just trying to give evidence of how you'd met, and someone else may already have said this, but generally on the first pass a good line is something like 'oh yes, we met at that coffee meeting': just letting them know the function that you met at. If you feel the need to add evidence, you can tell them something but giving them a context for why it stood out to you somehow softens it, so for example 'oh, I remembered you because you were wearing a dress with chameleons on and I thought that was so cool'. Another trick to soften it is to sound more unsure than you are - this isn't lying per se, it's a whole linguistic thing called 'mitigation' which people - especially neurotypical people - do to make their statements come across less aggressively, so 'I think you were the one who didn't like the caramel syrup in coffee shops, weren't you?'; the 'I think' and 'weren't you' are making the conversation more contributory for them so it feels less like you're coming at them or something. The 'oh yes' and 'oh' in my previous example is doing the same job, because the performed surprise gives them a little ground in the debate, which, again, means the conversation feels like you're both building to a conclusion together. I think this is also what Smee76 is getting at below. And I agree with the other commenter saying usually one piece of evidence is sufficient. You didn't do anything wrong, this is just a miscommunication, and I'm not saying you necessarily should do any of these things. Just tips in case you want them from someone who has leveraged a linguistics qualification to work out some hopefully neurotypical-friendly scripts in my own life.", "I used to remember details about people who\u2019d forgotten they\u2019d met me \u2026I ended up actively trying to *not* remember so people wouldn\u2019t think I was weird - unfortunately as a result my \u201cpeople\u201d memory is nowhere near what it used to be.", "Do you have eidetic memory?

I'm perceived as being a woman, and have ADHD and suspect I'm also autistic, and my brother is autistic so I have a very good \"autistic radar\" and can generally tell if someone is being creepy, or if they are just autistic and not quite hitting the sweet spot in terms of which information should be communicated and how. So, in OPs case, I think I would have realised he's autistic and not a stalker, but I can see how many women would feel disconcerted.\n\nI think the best solution is for people like OP to just preface statements like that with a reassuring \"I do this to everyone\" kinda especially thing when talking to women...

I don't think OP realizes how this can be perceived as stalker behaviour.", "Yep, ditto.", "Sorry that you had to go through that traumatic experience, but other people shouldn't have to change who they are because of your personal experience.

I don't *want* to assume the worst of guys- it's a horrible way to live, but life experience has trained me and other women to be on high alert to red flags  basically since birth. \n\n Literally just adding the caveat of 'I have a photographic memory for people so I remember xyz about you' before diving in with the details will make it so much easier for OP and whoever he's talking to.", "I apologize if this is something you know already.

It can creep people out just by being a little different from the norm. It's a you problem if it gets you bullied in school or you have a girl try to tell your friends you are creepy. Changing to be more \"normal\" is called masking. Often people who don't interact with other cultures will still feel there is something \"off\" about me for example.

Just wanted to tell you I have a photographic memory, and those kind of details stay with me even when I'm not trying to remember them. I didn't mean to scare you, sorry about that!\". Even a very shortened version of this would make the girl feel safer. Op heard he caused distress to someone by accident, but he didn't made any effort to fix it, especially it being so simple, even if OP didn't felt like talking to her, he could ask a common friend to explain it to her he wasn't maliciously keeping track of her movements.

I usually default to something like \"Yes, I remember when we met you were telling me about your grandmother's taxidermy school.

That didn't use to happen before the migraine, it's a bit like the noise in some areas went down so I can focus more on the math or remembering the estimated dimensions of an object from the visual memory of it. Very useful for furniture. So I'm not sure if that influenced the memory bit, but faces have always been this bad for me.\n\nAnyway, mild to moderate face blindness presents very similar to your description, very context dependant. Do you sometimes have to remember specific details about a person and file it away like a marker? I remember my boss by his hairband and his slight hunch. I describe it like faces just aren't... important to my brain. It's not so bad as in that one Oliver Sacks book! I remember the *person* but the *face* isn't attached to that. I also couldn't recognize my own face in the mirror for the longest time, but that faded away.\n\nAnyway, consider that you may just have both ADHD and face blindness, it's more common than you think and there's some statistical overlap - that's why you see it associated together so much in the literature I think.", "NAH. Frame the information differently when you share it otherwise it can come across as creepy. In other words, something like \"Hi [so and so]! You look familiar, have we met before?\" is a lot less creepy.
