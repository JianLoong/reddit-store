You completely innocently came across as a bit stalkery.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be embarrassed about your amazing memory, I bet it makes you really interesting to other people. But you might want to explain that you have a really good memory. You could have said to the woman: \u201cdon\u2019t worry you don\u2019t remember me, we only met once and I have a really amazing memory for people\u201d.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have called you a creep though, especially when your friend explained.

You\u2019ve got a good memory lol.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that you have a good memory is impressive.  Even if you didn't then a dress with chameleons on it is memorable in itself so not surprised you recall it.  \n\nPerhaps in the future don't bring up the details but be more vague.  For example instead of saying 'We met on 5th Jan at the Red Lion Pub when we were out with Daves family, you were drinking Prosecco and were wearing a green summer dress with chameleons on it' how about  just saying 'We met once at the pub a while ago when we were out with Dave'\n\nNothing wrong with recalling the details but it is a bit odd to bring them up and I can understand why someone may feel a little uncomfortable.  Absolutely no reason for them to go off accusing you of being a creep though.", "NTA\n\nIt's not as if you've listed anything unusual. These aren't small details that are somehow unusual. You didn't stalk her (I hope) and gave her information that she didn't reveal herself to you, I assume. I think she felt uncomfortable because she didn't remember herself.", "NTA \n\nMaybe explaining to her that you have an excellent memory when it comes to people and details would've been helpful after she didn't recognize you, thought. Personally I would've been impressed.\n\nI have the exact opposite problem of yours, I have a hard time remembering people and faces. \n\nExample: Working in retail was a nightmare, even when there were only two customer. When I had to check storage for items I was always unsure which customer wanted the item.\n\nAfter it also happened that I walked straight passed a flatmate I made it a habit of telling people that I'm sorry if I don't recognize them and that it's not me deliberately ignoring them.", "nta\n\nYou're not in the wrong here. If someone can't handle a harmless memory like that, it's on them. Keep being you.", "NTA. This is honestly a weird way to react. I'd be flattered and impressed that someone could remember things I told them so well.

Just say you're great at remembering that type of stuff. nta but don't take offence", "You should give more context when talking to a girl. You don't know how often she's been stalked before. But one thing I can tell you for sure: no matter how pretty she is, she's been stalked before.  \nIt's not weird to have a great memory, but out of context, for someone who has been socially taught that they are meant to be victimised more and who have actually experienced weird behaviours, it can raise alarms.\n\nAs a woman, I've been follow on foot by car numerous times. I've had guys come to me at the university library to tell me that they'd been watching me and found me fascinating - that guy then proceeded to stalk me for four months. I've had people take the wrong train just to keep asking my number. After a while, you just are more aware of red flags, and some dude remembering what you drink and what you wore nine months ago that's definitely one.\n\nIt doesn't make you an AH the first time you do it, just a blind man in a male society. But in the future, you might want to read people's reactions more before you start bragging, and be quick to offer a \"sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out, I just have a good memory, I can't help remembering things like that.\"", "NTA  although you could have coached her to exolain you have a photographic memory before you said it, then perhaps get your mutual friend to vouch for you. But that's wirh hindsight. Just recognise not all people's interactions would be the same. For example I read 1/6 of females in UK have had a bad experience which continues to define them. I know two people in that category that still are skittish. If this lady had it could explain why it freaked her out.\n\nHowever, continue to use your gifts! I find it fascinating!", "NTA. Individual quirks make a person unique. If she got grossed out its on her.", " This girl doesn't know your background/ special skill/ autism. \n  And this can't be the first time you've gotten this reaction. Tone it down.\nYou don't seem to realize How you come across to some people: Stalker-y.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't have malicious intentions.\n\n>I prefer to watch conversations and soak in the information rather than participate actively as my form of socialisation.\n\nHowever by the phrasing it seems like you don't really participate in most conversations but stand around observing others. So it seems like maybe most or at best half of the conversations you're memorizing our conversations others are having with each other that do not include you. Basically like you've gone to a party and you stand in the corner watching everyone but with a high memory recall.\n\nMany people will feel unnerved when someone they don't talk to comes up with specific key details about them. **Next time if these details did not come from a conversation you had with the person do not share them.**", "NTA but bro, to tell someone you can pickup and store a shitload of information about them is concerning, at least I'd be uncomfortable knowing I'm being so observed.", "NTA. She didn't remember you and she was embarrassed that you remembered her so clearly. Maybe she will pay more attention to the people she meets multiple times. Calling you a creep was uncalled for. And the hosts partner defending her seems like their misguided way of trying to keep the peace. Just ignore it and let it go. Keep doing you.", "ESH\n\nPeople tend to get uncomfortable when someone remembers something about themselves that they don't recall especially if its a very precise detail. Now its human nature that there are things that an outsider will remember about us that we will never physically recall ourselves. It can be a bit of a shock as an adult to realize that. Some people never reach that self-awareness.\n\nNow women tend to be more hyper aware of odd behavior and take it as a negative red flag rather than just a benign personality trait. It was wrong of her to immediately jump to the conclusion that you are creepy and especially wrong of her to start making comments about it at the party. Thank god your friend shut it down and stood up for you.\n\nHowever, if you're old enough to be having house warming parties etc, you are old enough to know that after she had confessed to not remembering you, you countering back with a very specific detail that she had no physical way of remembering is going to set off stranger danger flags. So its a little your fault for clarifying that you just happen to have a great memory and its not anything specifically about her that made you remember her in great detail.\n\nBut boy howdy that austism/ADHD recall has bit me in the butt many a time too.", "NAH verging on NTA\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, and I can also see why she might have been put off by the comment.\n\nTelling the hosts you were a creep was a bit much, though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hadn\u2019t actually assumed you were autistic, I meant more that because I spend so much time with autistic people I find unusual skills really normal. If the woman has had a less diverse experience she might not. But she needs to learn that everyone has different ways of thinking and different types of brains, and if she\u2019s going to go around judging people on that it kinda makes her a bigot.", "Did you get caught up in the other details that you forgot to say how/where you had met her before?\n\nIf so, relatable. \ud83d\ude02", "I also have a pretty good memory regarding people and conversations. I realized it makes some people uncomfortable to just blast out facts about them so I started phrasing them as questions which does not freak them out and it opens up conversations. \" I remember you didn't you wear that  sundress with chamaleons on it/ dislike most of the caramell flavors because they taste funny?\"", "It\u2019s definitely not a really great point. It\u2019s a point, but not even a good one. It\u2019s just stupid. Plenty of people are wallflowers.", "Why are you replying to me then and not the person above if you have such an issue with their point?\n\nYes, but if a person doesn't know someone and rhat someone spend a group conversation not saying anything, or giving any other indication that they're listening of course others are going to think they're not listening. So if they overheard something about someone and mentioned it, it makes sense they would be uncomfortable."]}
