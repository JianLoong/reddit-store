I swear it had very little to do with looks and a lot to do with how I felt - I like to hike and be outdoorsy and I was struggling to do those things. I made adjustments to my diet - I began to eat very clean at home so that going out I could just eat whatever I wanted and not obsess. At the time, I explained to my now husband (we had just moved in together) what I wanted to do and he actually agreed that it would be beneficial for our long term health. We've both done this ever since. I also started going to the gym. I run for 30-45 minutes every day (except rest days) and do about 5-7 hours of strength training per week. We also hike a lot. Because of these changes, both my husband and I have athletic looking figures.\n\nThe problem is my SIL. I don't care what she eats, never commented on it, generally love being around her. But she is constantly commenting that my husband and I \"eat like cows\" and says that we're \"privileged with skinny genes\". I try to explain that just because we eat unhealthy/in excess once a week (ex: we'll get an app, cocktails, then each get an entree with a side, and split dessert) when we see her doesn't mean we always do, but she doesn't believe me? \n\nI kind of learned to ignore these comments but over the weekend she looked at me at my birthday dinner when the rest of the table was quiet and said \"how's it feel to be God's favorite\", and said I was lucky to be born a 'skinny bitch'. I sort of \"lost it\" and explained in detail (again) that my husband and I are thin/athletic because of our healthy lifestyle, and told her that it's none of her business because it works for us. She then said \"not everybody was born loving exercise\" and whined that she wasn't born that way and I'm privileged to love it. I snapped at her that \"I actually hate running 50% of the time but I do it anyway because exercise is good for everyone and most people don't have any good excuse not to.\"\n\nShe called me an asshole and left, then sent me a long text about how it's fatphobic to say that everybody should be exercising and that I didn't bave a right to comment on her lifestyle, especially in public. I texted back that I'm sick of her jealous comments and to either not speak to me at all or learn to stop commenting on my lifestyle and focus on herseld. I'd like to reiterate that I do not care what other people eat or look like - I made these changes for me and my husbamd made the choice to do it for himself. Family is 50/50, seem to think I should be more sensitive - even though none spoke up all the years she commented on my body.

It seems really clear that she isn't comfortable in her own body and projecting that on to you out of jealousy. I can understand having something you worked for being boiled down to just \"good genes\" over and over again might push you over the edge. Your outburst is understandable. But maybe you should ask your SIL if she would like to go through what you do to keep the body that you have. If she says no, then don't go further. If she says yes, then maybe offer her guidance and advice. It can be hard getting into exercising if you've never done it before and if that is what she ultimately wants to do to feel better about herself, her comments may be a really bad way of trying to get your help. In the end, you're not an AH for explaining how you're able to look the way you do. You didn't tell her she had to lose any weight.", "NTA. I'm fat, but I would never think to skinny shame anyone.

I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, hit my recommended 150 minutes of moderate/75 minutes vigorous intensity workouts most weeks, and do my best to eat healthy food most of the time. I get blood work done annually because of mental health medications, and all my numbers look good. I am arguably healthier than many people who are skinnier than me.\n\nBut even if I weren't, the idea that fat means unhealthy is dangerous too because it is usually used in a way that correlates someone's value as an individual with how healthy (and skinny) they are. Some people will never be healthy due to chronic or congenital conditions, and it doesn't make them any less worthy of respect and proper care than someone who is in peak physical condition. \n\nIt's important to decouple the ideas of weight and health and the ideas of health and worth.", "NTA", "NTA. Why does she get to say what she wants, but you can\u2019t defend yourself?  It sounds like this is constant.  \n\nI think you restrained yourself.  You were not fat-phobic. Everybody should be exercising. But that means different things for different people. You didn\u2019t tell her everyone needs to run or bike or do intensive cardio. You said exercise.  We can all do with moving our bodies in some way. \n\nWhen my dad was towards the end of his life and was bed bound.  His health aid helped him exercise his legs and he used those things to improve your grip. He was doing something.  At the very least it made him feel accomplished.", "NTA. No one should be commenting on your body, and making you feel bad about it. No one.", "NTA. But next time she calls you a skinny bitch in public, loudly respond with \u201cDid you just call me a bitch?\u201d", "If SIL thinks it\u2019s appropriate for her to make comments on your body and lifestyle, she needs to be aware that you only travel two way streets. If she wants that door open, she better be ready for it to swing both ways. I think she needs to hear that out loud. Once you set that very clearly defined boundary, you\u2019ll only have to respond to her comments about you with something about her once or twice before she\u2019ll learn to stop. Either that or you won\u2019t see her anymore. NTA", "NTA", "NTA I have a friend like that . When I said something to her about trying to be healthy she got mad. Now 5 or 6 years later she opted for gastric bypass surgery and is miserable. Can eat anything and is always sick.", "Rage has been baited", "> skinny bitch\n\nThe correct response is, \u201cThank you\u201d \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAbsolutely NTA.\n\nHere\u2019s a t-shirt idea for the next gathering:\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/Mii3D6d8nzN6T7jJ7", "NTA for getting tired of her being nasty to you.  She's been attacking you verbally, and when you finally tell her to stop, she attacks you more, with false accusations.  It's very typical behavior for manipulative people to do.  This isn't your fault.", "Most people should breathe. Most people should eat food at some point during the day. \n\nI\u2019m confident in those statements while not \u201cknowing most people\u201d", "But the generalization is a correct one. Most people would benefit from exercise because humans evolved to be quite active. The new trend of people sitting on their butts for large portions of the day is negatively impacting us.", "Wut. Dude I don\u2019t like exercise but even I can admit that it\u2019s what most people should do regardless of how many people I know. Even my mum with her hip replacement and muscle wasting disease is recommended exercise.. I really don\u2019t think OP needs to go out into the world and talk to all the people to reinforce this\u2026", "Because Long Covid is common and people keep pushing the exercise it away when ME/CFS very limited studies shows that exercise can permanently disable you. \n\nShe can promote exercise to her SIL but her statement that exercise helps all is just wrong. I have Pots. You can\u2019t diet and exercise your autonervous system back. \n\nI was told the same words OP said after my illness and it made me sicker. I have a problem with her statement not with her intentions with SIL.", "Cleaning requires music for me, so my kids and I engage in regular karaoke and dance parties. Asthma might say I can't do things vigorously anymore, but yoga is wonderful and once it's not freezing out I'm going to love getting walks in.", "NTA because she had it coming but you could have shut it down cleanly a long time ago by just calling her out when she does it. \u201cI really don\u2019t appreciate your comments about my body. Please stop.\u201d Over and over and over until she gets it. \n\nAlso worth noting that I run and eat clean and follow all the recommendations and I\u2019m still overweight. I don\u2019t splurge on dinner once a week like you said you do. I\u2019m just saying there is some element that is out of our control. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much as people claim - for me it\u2019s about 15-20 lbs - but try to be more charitable in how you think about other people. Just because someone is overweight doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t doing all the things they are supposed to.", "NTA and I also run 30-45 minutes a day (except rest days).  Currently I'm on about 7 rest days a week.  Live your best life and don't worry about SIL.", "NTA \n\nCalories in vs calories out\n\nIt's not privilege. It's called motivation.", "NTA\n\nFor some reason, people don\u2019t realize that skinny shaming is a thing just like fat shaming. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely fine that you called her out.", "OP=NTA\n\n<< I didn't bave a right to comment on her lifestyle>>  But she has the right to comment on yours???   Hypocrisy 101=A-Hhood", "NTA but correcting her about your lifestyle/health/body just makes her view it as the topic of discussion (Because you're discussing it.)\n\n\"Stop talking about my body/my food,\" is what you say every time she brings it up.", "NTA. reminds me of a now former friend of mine who kept asking why i went to the gym since i\u2019m so skinny and it\u2019s like\u2026yeah, maybe there\u2019s a connection between my \u201cskinniness\u201d and gym-going?", "NTA and next time she comments on your body, point out to everyone around she\u2019s body shaming you and have been for years.", "NTA and there are 100% people fatter than me who are more fit than me. You said nothing about weight and were not being fatphobic.", "You're so right. I don't love the training part of exercise (I'm a swimmer and endless laps can get boring), but I love the part where I get in the water and swim in a natural body of water. It's one of the places I feel comfortable and confident in my own skin. I can swim long distances without finding it horrible, even if I don't love every minute in the pool. There's so many ways to exercise, and almost anyone can find something they love.", "I'm always open to learning more and listening to other perspectives. I appreciate you taking the time to explain in more detail. Personally, I think \"fat\" is thrown around a lot. And it's a pretty big spectrum. I think it's fair to say there are some people you can look at and assume they are not very healthy, but you're absolutely right that it is not solely based on body weight alone.", "Exactly. People have to learn that thin does not necessarily equal healthy. For all we know, that skinny stranger could be a chain smoker, have an eating disorder, be going through chemotherapy, etc.", "The sad part is so many people are \"fat\" because of health reasons or even mental health reasons. Because some meds cause weight gain.  Also some health problems make exercising very hard.  \n\nBut instead people assume it's because people are lazy etc.", "You're right, there are some people who assume. Is that the majority of people? I can't imagine 40% of adults in America are obese because of meds and mental health. But just north Canada is only 27%. I'd assume there are a lot of people who are also just lazy and unhealthy.", "You don\u2019t need any more support BUT my SIL is stick thin. I am not. I am so proud of her. She took up running in her 40\u2019s. Half Marathons and all. She looks and feels fantastic. I like wine and carbs more than running. I would never ever tell her she had good genes. (Even though she does) she also works her body consistently\n\nAlso NTA", "NTA.\n\nI am the \u201cskinny one\u201d always receiving these backhanded compliments.\nYou\u2019re not going to like my response, so shut the fuck up, Janet.", "NTA but this has really made me think about misconceptions people often have about others from what they only see in public. I am very similar in that when I\u2019m out with friends or family, I\u2019ll eat quite a large meal, and people will comment about how lucky I am to be skinny. But what they don\u2019t see is that I do strength training 4x a week and I am a very controlled eater at home. I don\u2019t eat super clean, but I rarely snack, don\u2019t have a sweet tooth, and most things I eat are home cooked by me (so not super calorie dense). Humans can\u2019t defy the laws or physics. CICO will ultimately prevail.", "NTA\n\nShe's insecure and taking it out on you.  I'm currently starting to workout myself and planning my diet,  as I'm 26 and starting to see my metabolism slow and gaining more weight than I care to admit. I haven't traveled much since COVID but realized I need to be fit to be able to keep up with the fast pace travels I use to do in my early 20's and teens because I WANT to travel soon. She's being a major AH.\n\nIt also has nothing to do with looks either.  I've been more confident than ever,  but if I can't reach a train or plan on a tight schedule, I'm SOL.\n\nI too, HATE running (Asthmatic) but I'm doing high cardio pilates to compensate so I CAN. \n\nFor reference, I'm currently 5'0\", but 145 Ibs. My goal is to get to 125 (as I want to account for muscle growth too) in the next few months. I'm not blessed to be athletic. On the contrary. I had to find what worked best for me.\n\nIf exercising is fat phobic. She should see my 250+ Ib friend (she's 5'4\") crush a couple miles walk and doing yoga. I'm proud of her.", "The correct response would have been, \"Feels great, thanks for asking\", with a proper smartass grin on your face.", "NTA.  I'm diabetic.  Exercise helps control blood sugar.  I hate exercising.  I mean, I loathe exercising.  On the other hand, I enjoy swimming.  I enjoy lifting weights.  I'm learning to enjoy tai chi.  I'm not a huge fan of the treadmill.  My gait is uneven, so I can't do that eliptical thing.  I also really like to hike.\n\nMy clothes fit better.  I have more stamina.  I don't have to be so careful about what I eat, although I do tend to stay with lower carb options because now I feel kind of loggy if I eat a bunch of carbs.  I also cook a lot at home which helps out.  The changes I made have nothing to do with being fat phobic.  They have nothing to do with wanting to look better.  It's all about my health and wellbeing.\n\nI've actually lost friends over it.  For the record, my mother has been overweight all my life.  She has not chosen to make the changes I've made.  I respect that and don't try to change who she is.  She often comments that she wishes she had my will power and determination to make changes.\n\nYou didn't say that everybody should be exercising.  You said that most people don't have a good excuse not to exercise.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I've got terrible arthritis in my right hip and I dislocate things easily.  My rheumatologist made it clear that my arthritis is no excuse to sit around and not do anything.  He also pointed out that building muscle will help prevent dislocations.", "NTA! Your SIL is a huge hater and she FAAFO (so exciting my first usage)!", "NTA. You work your behind off and she doesn't want to join the party. Boo hoo.", "Next time, look your friend in the eye and say \"that wasn't very poggers of you\"\nBasically be as cringe as saying excercise is fat phobic is. Lol"]}
