I swear it had very little to do with looks and a lot to do with how I felt - I like to hike and be outdoorsy and I was struggling to do those things. I made adjustments to my diet - I began to eat very clean at home so that going out I could just eat whatever I wanted and not obsess. At the time, I explained to my now husband (we had just moved in together) what I wanted to do and he actually agreed that it would be beneficial for our long term health. We've both done this ever since. I also started going to the gym. I run for 30-45 minutes every day (except rest days) and do about 5-7 hours of strength training per week. We also hike a lot. Because of these changes, both my husband and I have athletic looking figures.\n\nThe problem is my SIL. I don't care what she eats, never commented on it, generally love being around her. But she is constantly commenting that my husband and I \"eat like cows\" and says that we're \"privileged with skinny genes\". I try to explain that just because we eat unhealthy/in excess once a week (ex: we'll get an app, cocktails, then each get an entree with a side, and split dessert) when we see her doesn't mean we always do, but she doesn't believe me? \n\nI kind of learned to ignore these comments but over the weekend she looked at me at my birthday dinner when the rest of the table was quiet and said \"how's it feel to be God's favorite\", and said I was lucky to be born a 'skinny bitch'. I sort of \"lost it\" and explained in detail (again) that my husband and I are thin/athletic because of our healthy lifestyle, and told her that it's none of her business because it works for us. She then said \"not everybody was born loving exercise\" and whined that she wasn't born that way and I'm privileged to love it. I snapped at her that \"I actually hate running 50% of the time but I do it anyway because exercise is good for everyone and most people don't have any good excuse not to.\"\n\nShe called me an asshole and left, then sent me a long text about how it's fatphobic to say that everybody should be exercising and that I didn't bave a right to comment on her lifestyle, especially in public. I texted back that I'm sick of her jealous comments and to either not speak to me at all or learn to stop commenting on my lifestyle and focus on herseld. I'd like to reiterate that I do not care what other people eat or look like - I made these changes for me and my husbamd made the choice to do it for himself. Family is 50/50, seem to think I should be more sensitive - even though none spoke up all the years she commented on my body.

It's not a phobia, you're just unhealthy.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nAnd just to rest easy, What would make you fatphobic is if you believed people should exercise to be skinny specifically (or if you insisted larger people can't be healthy, even though you are not their doctor). Throughout the post, you made it pretty clear that exercise for you is about capabilities not looks.", "NTA - you didn't push your lifestyle on her so I wouldn't say you were fatphobic. It seems really clear that she isn't comfortable in her own body and projecting that on to you out of jealousy. I can understand having something you worked for being boiled down to just \"good genes\" over and over again might push you over the edge. Your outburst is understandable. But maybe you should ask your SIL if she would like to go through what you do to keep the body that you have. If she says no, then don't go further. If she says yes, then maybe offer her guidance and advice. It can be hard getting into exercising if you've never done it before and if that is what she ultimately wants to do to feel better about herself, her comments may be a really bad way of trying to get your help. In the end, you're not an AH for explaining how you're able to look the way you do. You didn't tell her she had to lose any weight.", "NTA. I'm fat, but I would never think to skinny shame anyone.

Wheres is the wrong in saying what OP said?", "You seen to be open to learning more, so I'm going to add to what was said above.\n\nWeight is only *one* indicator of health, and you cannot tell how healthy someone is - or even how physically fit they are - by weight alone. \n\nI'm fat. I also have a resting heart rate of 57 bpm, which is in the athlete range for a woman my age. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, hit my recommended 150 minutes of moderate/75 minutes vigorous intensity workouts most weeks, and do my best to eat healthy food most of the time. I get blood work done annually because of mental health medications, and all my numbers look good. I am arguably healthier than many people who are skinnier than me.\n\nBut even if I weren't, the idea that fat means unhealthy is dangerous too because it is usually used in a way that correlates someone's value as an individual with how healthy (and skinny) they are. Some people will never be healthy due to chronic or congenital conditions, and it doesn't make them any less worthy of respect and proper care than someone who is in peak physical condition. \n\nIt's important to decouple the ideas of weight and health and the ideas of health and worth."]}
