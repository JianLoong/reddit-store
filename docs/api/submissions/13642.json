{"id": 13642, "submission_id": "127mooy", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL that I think almost everyone would benefit from exercising and to stop acting so jealous?", "selftext": "For context, 5-6 years ago (in my late 20's) I realized, as many people do, that I could no longer eat and drink whatever I wanted 24/7 - I started packing on weight really fast and it made me feel uncomfortable. I swear it had very little to do with looks and a lot to do with how I felt - I like to hike and be outdoorsy and I was struggling to do those things. I made adjustments to my diet - I began to eat very clean at home so that going out I could just eat whatever I wanted and not obsess. At the time, I explained to my now husband (we had just moved in together) what I wanted to do and he actually agreed that it would be beneficial for our long term health. We've both done this ever since. I also started going to the gym. I run for 30-45 minutes every day (except rest days) and do about 5-7 hours of strength training per week. We also hike a lot. Because of these changes, both my husband and I have athletic looking figures.\n\nThe problem is my SIL. I don't care what she eats, never commented on it, generally love being around her. But she is constantly commenting that my husband and I \"eat like cows\" and says that we're \"privileged with skinny genes\". I try to explain that just because we eat unhealthy/in excess once a week (ex: we'll get an app, cocktails, then each get an entree with a side, and split dessert) when we see her doesn't mean we always do, but she doesn't believe me? \n\nI kind of learned to ignore these comments but over the weekend she looked at me at my birthday dinner when the rest of the table was quiet and said \"how's it feel to be God's favorite\", and said I was lucky to be born a 'skinny bitch'. I sort of \"lost it\" and explained in detail (again) that my husband and I are thin/athletic because of our healthy lifestyle, and told her that it's none of her business because it works for us. She then said \"not everybody was born loving exercise\" and whined that she wasn't born that way and I'm privileged to love it. I snapped at her that \"I actually hate running 50% of the time but I do it anyway because exercise is good for everyone and most people don't have any good excuse not to.\"\n\nShe called me an asshole and left, then sent me a long text about how it's fatphobic to say that everybody should be exercising and that I didn't bave a right to comment on her lifestyle, especially in public. I texted back that I'm sick of her jealous comments and to either not speak to me at all or learn to stop commenting on my lifestyle and focus on herseld. I'd like to reiterate that I do not care what other people eat or look like - I made these changes for me and my husbamd made the choice to do it for himself. Family is 50/50, seem to think I should be more sensitive - even though none spoke up all the years she commented on my body. AITA?\n\nTl;dr: SIL wouldn't stop going on about my lifestyle/exercising habits so I snapped at her and said most people should exercise. Apparently I'm fat phobic.

All you did was defend yourself and promote exercising. her problem if she wants to play victim.", "NTA.  Going to be honest, the title made me think OP was going to be the AH here but that is not how the story played out.  SiL's constant commentary and judgement rewarded her with a comeback that was defensive but mostly tame.  She's a bully playing victim at this point.", "NTA\n\nShe was out of line with her comments, somehow managing to combine commentary on appearances with commentary on what you ate with excusing herself for not exercising, which apparently she feels guilty about.\n\n\"fatphobic\", she says.

She went to the extent of calling you a \"skinny bitch.\" Your SIL is the only AH here. She sounds extremely jealous that you are able to have control to eat clean and healthy throughout the week, while also exercising, to allow yourself one cheat day. She could follow the same lifestyle, even while doing less exercise, and begin to lose weight herself. She needs to redirect her negativity elsewhere and focus on her own health, rather than the health of others.", "Living well and looking fit and skinny is your best \u201crevenge\u201d, I guess you would say, maybe not the best word-but -whatever. \n\nYour SIL knows damned well what effort you put in to feel fit, and she doesn\u2019t wanna do it. Instead of admiring you or at least keeping her trap shut about it, she complains about you in public. It sucks to be jealous. NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYour SIL sounds insecure.", "NTA, her comments are opening the discussion. She comments on your body, you can comment on hers. I also hate exercising and am no actively trying to build a habit so at least I spend less energy avoiding it.

She is extremely self conscious about her body and is projecting that onto you as jealousy and shame overwhelm her. If you want to make amends you can offer support if she'd like to join you at the gym or meal planning, but in all likeliness she's going to see that as an attack on her inability to commit to healthy living. Tell her that it's hurtful to everyone when she takes out her pain by commenting on other people's bodies.", "NTA.  Tell her to keep her comments to herself and you will do the same.  Tell the family that they did nothing when she made her rude comments so then they should keep doing nothing about your response. Your SIL is projecting her insecurity on you.", "NTA, I say this as someone who was always called a skinny bitch and was made fun of as much as a bigger person\u2026 you look dead, anorexic type comments, people think you cant insult a thin person, I was so small and put on adhd meds I looked unhealthy. I think this woman is lashing out but is probably just repeating things she has always said and heard others say, maybe she accepts herself and maybe she doesn\u2019t. If you talk to her just say you\u2019re not fat phobic, rather you enjoy a healthier lifestyle and do still enjoy food at times, it\u2019s a happy medium. Tell her you don\u2019t judge others or see an issue with her own choices. if you think it won\u2019t blow up, ask maybe she can join for a hike to see for herself maybe she will enjoy it. Some people are truly hard on bigger people in not understanding it isn\u2019t always a lifestyle thing that is fat phobic, people who are very active and eat healthy can still be big so I understand frustration and where the idea of \u201cskinny genes\u201d is formed.", "NTA.

Stop.", "Nta, she has the nerve to call you fatphobic, while she did nothing but body shamed you and be disrespectful to you for no reason, like no sis you can't wip out fatphobia after you were a nasty bully to someone about their body, she is a hypocrite and ahole, so no nta and she need to keep her thoughts to herself and keep her mouth shut.", "NTA. Have a private conversation first with her then with your MIL/FIL. Tell them all that you love her but you now have zero tolerance for any comments about your body shape and that each time she makes a comment about it you and your husband will leave. Then prepare to walk out of 5-6 events. Eventually she'll stop.", "Nta", "nta\n\nBody shaming is body shaming and food shaming is food shaming and she is doing both. You explaining your health routine is not fat shaming.  At all. She on the other hand is going out of her way to make you feel like crap not only for what you choose to eat when you are out, but goes on to shame you for your health choices. She's not worth the effort.", "I\u2019m someone who went to a lot of effort to lose weight. Diet, exercise, medication, surgery. \n\nIf someone saw me indulging (I do on rare occasions, and because of the surgery I have to plan it and be careful with it) and made a comment like that I\u2019d be pretty pissed. \n\nShe came at you repeatedly, and you were nice and explained. She didn\u2019t learn or get the point. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\nMost people should exercise, it does a body good.  Did you call her fat?  Did you call her lazy?  Did you say she eats like a cow? She needs to stop taking her insecurities out on you.", "NTA. This is a case of FAAFO.\n\nExercise is good to pretty much everybody. Bedridden people have exercise to help get out of their situation - it's called physical therapy. People who lost limbs exercise to learn how to balance the new body. Exercise is like brushing your teeth: not the best thing to do your time, but necessary for your health.", "NTA - Im probably going against the grain here but I don't get the whole fat phobic thing. It's not a phobia, you're just unhealthy.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nAnd just to rest easy, What would make you fatphobic is if you believed people should exercise to be skinny specifically (or if you insisted larger people can't be healthy, even though you are not their doctor). Throughout the post, you made it pretty clear that exercise for you is about capabilities not looks.", "NTA - you didn't push your lifestyle on her so I wouldn't say you were fatphobic. It seems really clear that she isn't comfortable in her own body and projecting that on to you out of jealousy. I can understand having something you worked for being boiled down to just \"good genes\" over and over again might push you over the edge. Your outburst is understandable. But maybe you should ask your SIL if she would like to go through what you do to keep the body that you have. If she says no, then don't go further. If she says yes, then maybe offer her guidance and advice. It can be hard getting into exercising if you've never done it before and if that is what she ultimately wants to do to feel better about herself, her comments may be a really bad way of trying to get your help. In the end, you're not an AH for explaining how you're able to look the way you do. You didn't tell her she had to lose any weight.", "NTA. I'm fat, but I would never think to skinny shame anyone. It's just as bad as fat shaming. I do exercise, eat well most of the time though and am still fat. lol It happens.", "Your SIL was wrong but you shouldn't make generalizations about \"most people\".
