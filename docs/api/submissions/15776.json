I agreed. I was wearing a black shirt that was tight fitting and exact length to just cover my whole stomach, denim skirt with shorts under, black belt, small hole fishnet stockings, and a white cardigan. I wore fashion sneakers as shoes. I dress very very conservatively in school, but when I go out during the weekends I like to feel cute/comfy because I don\u2019t feel as insecure around people who aren\u2019t my classmates. \n\nBefore arriving at the restaurant (mom drove me, didn\u2019t come in), my friend messaged me saying that her mom is a really nice lady, her sister is very talkative, and that her father is a very likable guy who\u2019s easy to talk to. I felt comfortable with these descriptions. \n\nOnce I walked in, she gave me a hug and her mom shook my hand, but grimaced while looking me up and down. Her dad barely talked to me and looked like he didn\u2019t want me to be there. The sister was not talkative, rather very quiet and looking apologetic. She didn\u2019t speak a word the whole dinner.\n\nI sat next to my friend and just stuck to chatting with her. She told me I looked uncomfortable. I was, but I just said I don\u2019t know how I feel. Later, her mom walked over and sat next to her, demanding her attention. I just pretended to scroll on my phone while they whispered. I heard her mom say \u201cShe\u2019s pretty, but she also looks like a filthy slut. How are her grades?\u201d This upset me. My friend is Indian, so I expected them to be conservative but did their mom really have to say this right in front of me? \n\nI opened my messages to my mom\u2019s contact and wrote a message making sure my phone was in perfect view of my friend\u2019s mother. I wrote \u201cDude, *friend\u2019s name\u2019s* mom looks like an old ugly hag.\u201d My friend\u2019s mom frowned and stood up. She said \u201cexcuse me? I didn\u2019t know my daughter befriended such disrespectful girls\u201d Then she walked away. The rest of the night was awkward as I finished my meal. \n\nWhen everyone was done, we all walked out and my friend\u2019s parents stood in front of me. \u201cRight. See you.\u201d Her dad said and the mom walked to the car. It was pretty dark, and they were the last car there/restaurant had locked up. They left and I immediately called my mom asking her to pick me up because I get nervous alone. She was FURIOUS that they had left a minor girl alone in the night. I didn\u2019t think it was that serious, but my mom was very concerned about what could have happened to me. \n\nLater, I told mom what my friend\u2019s mom called me and she was angrier so she searched for the mom\u2019s number to argue. Mom thinks that my message to her was justified, but the next week at school my friend wouldn\u2019t speak to me saying I was immature and just HAD to create issues.\nI don\u2019t want to talk to her now either and she apologized today but I feel really bad and don\u2019t want to respond to her message. \n\nDoes this all make me an ass?", "created_utc": 1682548576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1301xu4/aita_for_calling_my_friends_mother_an_ugly_old_hag/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, but it\u2019s also justified for the *child* to have a less-than-perfect response to an *adult* demeaning and sexualizing her. You behaved appropriately given your age and the circumstances. The mom and dad did not.\n\nYou responded like a kid. Which, *you are.* They were behaving much worse than you and actively *invited* that response.\n\nNext time when you\u2019re in an uncomfortable situation, text your mom right then to pick you up instead.

How are her grades?\"\n\nWho says this about a 15 year old girl? Sure what you said was childish and all but what your friend's mom said was way worse.

You\u2019re only 15 years old, these people are adults. Adults need to start showing respect if they expect it to be reciprocated. However, if you were hoping to continue hanging out with your friends, that was not the best move. They are conservative clearly and you cannot change that, but your not the asshole for reacting to their rudeness. Also, was it not previously arranged who would bring you home? Them leaving you alone in an area that has been locked up is completely inappropriate. Something could have happened to you and they disregarded that because they couldn\u2019t take what they dishes.", "NTA.\n\nShe's an adult.

Why didn\u2019t your friend stand up for you? Why did the mom have such an issue with you calling her a name that wasn\u2019t half as bad as to what she called you? Your mom was right to argue with her- especially AFTER they left you in a dark parking lot.", "NTA. Your reaction to her was probably a bit on the immature side, but you probably already know that. For her parents to say that about you is inexcusable and they're absolute garbage... and then for your friend to give you grief about it? I don't blame you for not wanting to talk to her.", "These people are awful and, honestly, deserved your comment and more. NTA", "NTA BUT I have a feeling your friend said that to you out of reaction to what she faces at home. She probably has to fight for every freedom and now her parents are questioning her judgment in friends. I'd go easy on her this one time and say you understand this might be the case, but you won't let people disrespect you, and her mom fit the bill.", "Free Advice? Accept the apology. \n\nYou're 15. Your world is very small, and once you're done school, it actually gets smaller. \n\nFriends fight. The best part of that is making up. It's how a good friendship grow into great friendships. Talk to her and let her talk to you.", "NTA. \n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you.\n\nYour outfit sounds cool.", "ESH. You mention you dress \"very, very conservatively\" at school. Did your friend only know you dressing this way? If so, when she invited you to dinner, she might have assumed this was your mode of dress. The way you dressed going to dinner (a tight shirt \"the exact length to just cover your\" stomach, fishnet stockings, etc.) was anything but conservative. \n\nYou said your friend was Indian, so you expected her family to be conservative. Knowing this, why would you dress this way? This is not victim blaming, but \"read the room\" and act appropriately. Your choice of dress on an initial meeting with your friends' family could be seen as disrespectful. Whether this was a first meeting of your friends' family, a boyfriend's family, or a job interview, you only have one time to make a first impression.  \n\nThe mother was way out of line by calling you names. This was rude and disrespectful to you. Your response of calling her a hag was childish and immature and did not help the situation. Never in a million years should they have left you alone at the restaurant, so for that reason, they are more of an A-hole than you.", "ESH. You spread this insult over text in front of her face rather than asking to remove yourself from the situation.

I was going to say ESH, but your friend really doesn't. Your friends mother is, though.  Your friends mother was way out of line saying those things about you and you were absolutely justified in what you said about her.   However, you took no consideration in how what you said might affect your friend.  Sometimes, we need to take the high road even when we are justified.\n\nBut that's not what makes YTA.  The real problem is your friend, who has no control over what her mother says, apologized to you, but you are still holding it against your friend.\n\nFor that...

Such is life.", "YNTA, but sometimes it\u2019s smart to think like Michelle Obama: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d.  They really steeped low and were absolutely horrible toward you. Your reaction was perhaps petty, but also how we all wish we could react, if we\u2019re really honest. But then we try thinking a bit further down, and we try to go high, at least as well as we can.\n\nBut your friend has asked for your apology. I hope you can accept that, and that you will invite her to dinners and sleepovers with your family. Because for her, the really off family dynamic you experienced is her normal. She doesn\u2019t know anything different, which can explain why it took her a while telling you she was sorry. As her friend, I hope you\u2019ll be the one showing her what is normal.", "ESH.  Indian culture can maaaaaybe explain the first reaction.  Everyone was disrepectful toward each other", "ESH, except for the friend.
