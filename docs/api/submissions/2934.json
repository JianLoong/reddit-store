We'll call her Kathy. For context, I come from a lower middle class family while Kathy comes from a lower class family. My family isn't rich, but I was fortunate enough to have my parents support me so I can focus on school while Kathy's parents weren't able to do the same so she had to support herself.\n\nI can't remember when it started, but Kathy would make comments about how super lucky I was to have my parents pay for my things. I didn't mind the comments at first, but recently her comments became more passive aggressive and snarky. I just assumed she was stress from trying to find a job after graduating. She would say things like \"I'm glad I didn't have to rely on my parents like (my name) did\" or \"finding a job is hard since I didn't have it easy like (my name)\". She would say these things around my other group of friends and put me in an awkward spot since they would agree with her sometimes.\n\nThe other night I was hanging out with Kathy and the rest of our friends, and we were talking about how we wanted to raise our kids in the future. Right away I had an idea of where this was going. Kathy started saying that she was going to make her kids work for their own things and learn how to be independent. I had no problem with what she was saying until she said something like \"people who were given everything by their mommy and daddy their entire life don't know how to be grateful for things and wouldn't survive in the real world\"\n\nI immediately responded that my parents supported me and I turned out to be just fine. I'm \"surviving in the real world\" and also repaying my parents through gifts, helping them pay bills, and so forth. Kathy laughed and said that I had it easy my entire life so I had no say in the conversation. That's when I called her out on her passive aggressive behavior and told her that while I do respect her for not relying on her parents, she needs to stop her comments because it's not my fault my parents were able to support me and hers weren't. \n\nThings got awkward for the rest of the night, and Kathy and I haven't talked since. One of my friend said that my comment was insensitive while another friend said it was okay to call Kathy out since she's been doing this for a while now. Sometimes I feel like Kathy was projecting her emotions onto me.

Sounds like you have the same friend group so might not be possible.", "NTA, sounds like your friend is bitter and jealous. It's one thing be independant and not relying on your parents, but shaming someone for their priviledged upbringing is AH behaviour. Calling her out was plentily justified.", "NTA\n\nWhile it sucks that Kathy couldn't get help from her parents like you did, that doesn't give her the right to act like an AH to you. And yes, Kathy is projecting the fact she's jealous that your parents helped her while hers couldn't.\n\nChances are she hasn't seen you as a friend for a long time.

Not only that but should've called her out every time she made a comment. \n\nYou need to set your boundaries, if not then you are giving people the right to insult you like in this situation. You never corrected her before so she kept doing it. Then when you finally stand up for yourself, she can't handle it. \n\nShe's not your friend. She's definitely jealous of you and has been putting you down in front of others for years. Probably to try and make herself feel better because she felt like she had a shitty upbringing. Instead of focusing on herself, she focused on you.\n\nJust cut her off and move on. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life.", "NTA, your friend and bitter for not having what you had maybe in her sick mind life would have to open doors because she didn't have a peaceful childhood, even though she had to be independent from a young age she never learned that the world is not fair, that people will not have the same opportunities and that complaining about other people's lives or being jealous will not lead anywhere", "NTA. As a mother now, I don\u2019t understand why so many of my friends in High School would totally bag on people who\u2019s parents supported them financially. \u201cOh did mommy and daddy buy that for you???\u201d I remember people saying to others and even I would talk about the kids who had that. But now as a parent, I\u2019m proud that I can help my kids out. Absolutely I bought it for them. I\u2019m also going to allow them to live rent free at home until around 25 if they want, to build up their savings and give them a financial foundation for their future. I\u2019m no longer seeing how parental support is a bad thing! And if you were wondering, I started my first job at 14 and did everything on my own. We were all envious of those kids but couldn\u2019t admit it.", "NTA - she's been picking at you for a long time, desiring some kind of reaction from you. She got one and it was pretty mild. You didn't call her names or denegrate her in any way. Why some of your friends think it is okay for her to constantly try to belittle you and made you feel bad, this one mild comment from you is \"insensitive\" - I think her comments were insensitive.", "You're NTA. Her bitterness is misdirected and she needed to be told it's way past the time to lay off the snarky remarks.", "NTA, she\u2019s not a real friend. She\u2019s jealous and makes sure everybody knows", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s clear she\u2019s resentful for not having the opportunities in life that her peers did.  And, that\u2019s totally understandable.  Financial insecurity is hard on people, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to have some negative feelings about what that situation put her through.\n\nBut it\u2019s not cool of her to take that out on you.  It\u2019s one thing to lament that your situation growing up was hard, but it\u2019s something else entirely to essentially tell your friends that they\u2019re lazy and ungrateful because they weren\u2019t as unlucky as you.  You had just as much control over your lot in life as she did.  It\u2019s just as unfair of her to say you don\u2019t know hard work because you grew up with financial security as it would be for you to say something crappy like \u201coh well you grew up poor so you must not know anything about saving money\u201d.  \n\nYes, you were more privileged than she was.  But unless you\u2019re out here rubbing that in her face or acting like she didn\u2019t face more/different struggles than you did, it\u2019s pretty out of line of her to keep throwing it in your face like that.", "NTA lol get rid of her. a bear can only be poked so many times lol", "NTA", "NTA. Let me put it in perspective. My cousins were raised in an upper middle class home and my siblings and I were raised in a lower middle class home. They went to significantly better schools, got more extra-curricular activities, their parents paid for their university up front, and bought an paid for (multiple) cars. I went to a good school, got a job at 15, paid my own way through uni (government loan system, paid for my supplies and room/board), and bought and paid for my own car. My siblings elected to go to trade school.\n\nI don't think badly of my cousins at all. Sure, I was jealous at the time because my teenage brain said \"look at all the stuff they have that I don't\". But I worked hard, and so did they. I learned the difference between equality and equity. I recognised that our situations were different but in the end we are all adults now and while they may have had it \"easier\" as children, we were all equal *adults* in the big, bad world now. I even outearn them all but they don't hold it against me because *that's the way life works*.\n\nShe's acting like a child. Call her out all you want.", "YTA for not knocking her out.

I grew up upper middle class, my parents paid for my schooling and housing during school. But they also pressured me in high school to lie about my brother abusing me and I struggled a lot during university because of all the unresolved trauma. They also put unnecessary pressure on me to go to the gym (I didn\u2019t) and to get all A\u2019s (also something I was unable to achieve, although I did get two A\u2019s my first semester and three B's which my mom made me feel bad about). I hate when people only look at the financial support aspect, because they act like you couldn\u2019t have possibly struggled or needed to work hard because you didn\u2019t have money problems.

Because the lesson Kathy should take from your different experiences should not be resentment of yours, but pride in her own - and determination to pass the benefits of her education and the opportunities it will bring to her own child(ren) down the road, like your parents did for you.
