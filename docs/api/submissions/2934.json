I didn't mind the comments at first, but recently her comments became more passive aggressive and snarky. I just assumed she was stress from trying to find a job after graduating. She would say things like \"I'm glad I didn't have to rely on my parents like (my name) did\" or \"finding a job is hard since I didn't have it easy like (my name)\". She would say these things around my other group of friends and put me in an awkward spot since they would agree with her sometimes.\n\nThe other night I was hanging out with Kathy and the rest of our friends, and we were talking about how we wanted to raise our kids in the future. Right away I had an idea of where this was going. Kathy started saying that she was going to make her kids work for their own things and learn how to be independent. I had no problem with what she was saying until she said something like \"people who were given everything by their mommy and daddy their entire life don't know how to be grateful for things and wouldn't survive in the real world\"\n\nI immediately responded that my parents supported me and I turned out to be just fine. I'm \"surviving in the real world\" and also repaying my parents through gifts, helping them pay bills, and so forth. Kathy laughed and said that I had it easy my entire life so I had no say in the conversation. That's when I called her out on her passive aggressive behavior and told her that while I do respect her for not relying on her parents, she needs to stop her comments because it's not my fault my parents were able to support me and hers weren't. \n\nThings got awkward for the rest of the night, and Kathy and I haven't talked since.

But now as a parent, I\u2019m proud that I can help my kids out. Absolutely I bought it for them. I\u2019m also going to allow them to live rent free at home until around 25 if they want, to build up their savings and give them a financial foundation for their future.

Financial insecurity is hard on people, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to have some negative feelings about what that situation put her through.\n\nBut it\u2019s not cool of her to take that out on you.  It\u2019s one thing to lament that your situation growing up was hard, but it\u2019s something else entirely to essentially tell your friends that they\u2019re lazy and ungrateful because they weren\u2019t as unlucky as you.  You had just as much control over your lot in life as she did.  It\u2019s just as unfair of her to say you don\u2019t know hard work because you grew up with financial security as it would be for you to say something crappy like \u201coh well you grew up poor so you must not know anything about saving money\u201d.  \n\nYes, you were more privileged than she was.

My siblings elected to go to trade school.\n\nI don't think badly of my cousins at all. Sure, I was jealous at the time because my teenage brain said \"look at all the stuff they have that I don't\". But I worked hard, and so did they. I learned the difference between equality and equity. I recognised that our situations were different but in the end we are all adults now and while they may have had it \"easier\" as children, we were all equal *adults* in the big, bad world now.

I grew up upper middle class, my parents paid for my schooling and housing during school.

I hate when people only look at the financial support aspect, because they act like you couldn\u2019t have possibly struggled or needed to work hard because you didn\u2019t have money problems.
