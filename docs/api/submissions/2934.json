I didn't mind the comments at first, but recently her comments became more passive aggressive and snarky. I just assumed she was stress from trying to find a job after graduating. She would say things like \"I'm glad I didn't have to rely on my parents like (my name) did\" or \"finding a job is hard since I didn't have it easy like (my name)\".

Right away I had an idea of where this was going. Kathy started saying that she was going to make her kids work for their own things and learn how to be independent. I had no problem with what she was saying until she said something like \"people who were given everything by their mommy and daddy their entire life don't know how to be grateful for things and wouldn't survive in the real world\"\n\nI immediately responded that my parents supported me and I turned out to be just fine.

You had just as much control over your lot in life as she did.  It\u2019s just as unfair of her to say you don\u2019t know hard work because you grew up with financial security as it would be for you to say something crappy like \u201coh well you grew up poor so you must not know anything about saving money\u201d.  \n\nYes, you were more privileged than she was.

Jeez wish I\u2019d thought of that fact earlier it totally would have stopped me from being traumatized lmfao", "NTA. \n\nI have been the You in this situation with my own Kathy friends. For cultural and family reasons, my parents supported me while I got myself together. Very few of my friends were as privileged and things got tense as we moved into early adulthood.\n\nI'm a  lot older than you and with time I've come to understand something I didn't see back then. Not always, but most of the time... the frustration and tension your friends demonstrate isn't actually directed at you at all. Especially if youre from the same general unprivileged background like you two are. Frequently they are hurt and upset at their parents and don't yet have the emotional skills to know how to handle that. Different things can motivate this. A lot of the time it's that they can see their financial situation is because of choices their parents made... they feel resentful of that and turn that resentment toward the person who has shoved this reality in their face. Other times they may be frustrated that their parents made excellent choices and still couldn't get ahead, and they again turn that resentment toward those they perceive as not working as hard. It's incredibly confusing and disorienting to become an adult with a separate life from those who raised us. Sometimes during that process we end up learning things about our families that we didn't want to figure out. It's often easier to place blame at the folks who didn't have to struggle because confronting the ideas that \"my parents allowed me to struggle because they didn't make smart choices\" or \"my parents worked their ass off and the system is so fecked that we still have no savings\" really hurts. It's not fun to confront class and economic differences. Compassion, empathy and making sure your friends know how proud of them you are will all go a long way in this situation. \n\nIn the future, I suggest trying to be patient with friends like this. Avoid making this about values or sacrifice. It's not like one set of parents values education more, yanno? Because you grew up lower middle class, you might have some success if you are able to talk about the sacrifices your parents made to make this possible. That often helps put things into perspective. For example, a friend's dad worked Friday night shifts to give her the spending money she had for the week. People backed off when they understood that it wasn't like her dad just threw money at her. Someone *was* working for it.", "NTA - Everyone has a tipping point. She found yours.   \n\n\nSounds like this girl has an inferiority complex and this is how she makes up for it.", "NTA, not your best friend. I don't think she has been for a while now, and I think you'd agree...", "NTA and Kathy is jealous. You shouldn\u2019t have to put up with this from someone who\u2019s a friend", "NTA it\u2019s ok to not be friends with people who clearly don\u2019t like you. She doesn\u2019t like you op and that is ok.", "NTA.  Kathy has been talking shit about you for a while and you finally stood up for yourself.  Good for you.\n\nBTW, Kathy is NOT a good friend.", "NTA! My roommate did this constantly coz she had to give money to her parents and I never did.\nShe kept saying how my life is perfect. Everytime I would be stressed about anything, she would say what have I for worry about,  I have it easy.\nSo I got passive aggressive back with her and would always reply with 'I know it's good to me isn't it?' Or ' My life is perfect' with a laugh. She shut up real quick after that.\n\nWent NC after she moved out. Probably best thing in long rim for you. \nNtA!", "NTA. She\u2019s bitter and needs to get a grip. A lot of college students, if not the majority, receive some financial support from their parents. That\u2019s what college savings are for. If someone\u2019s parents never had the opportunity to set aside that money, it\u2019s a bummer, but it\u2019s not your problem. You sound totally aware of how lucky you are, and I\u2019d be bullshit if someone treated me like she treated you.", "NTA. I have one friend similar to yours. I recently got married & she was telling my other friend that \u2018 I was lucky that my parents got me so many jewellery & were able to afford such big wedding\u2019 she even commented on my husband ( he\u2019s very handsome) saying that I\u2019m lucky that I got such handsome husband. I came to know about her comments after the wedding. And later she commented about me having money to buy anything I want even though she also earns really well. So I have just cut her off. I don\u2019t need any negative/ jealous friends. You need to do the same.", "She's not your friend and hasnt been for a while now. You just didnt realize. NTA and distance yourself", "NTA.  She kept on with her bs and you finally had enough and said something back.  No one has to be verbally and emotionally abused to make another person feel better for their lack thereof.  It is a privilege that your parents could help so much, but there is nothing wrong with accepting that help so you can focus on your betterment.  \n\nYou are paying it back too, so your \"friend\" Kathy needs to sit down and shut up.  You can receive help and not become entitled and contribute to society just fine.  Instead of being thankful for learning to survive and get through on her own, she's still harping on people who had it a little easier.  She's failed to learn from her experience properly.", "NTA.  She\u2019s the one who carried on like you were personally responsible for her having a hard life.  Some friend she is.", "NTA.  I could not put up with someone who constantly did this to me.", "NTA, I feel bad sometimes because my parents were lower middle class and happy together. So many people don\u2019t get that family set up where I\u2019m from, so they struggle in various ways. I\u2019m made to feel guilty that my parents helped support me when I needed it because they could. Kathy needs a reality check that you had no control over your upbringing, and you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for it.", "So because she was \u2018poorer\u2019 than you, it gives her a free pass to be a bully? \n\nI mean if your friends are okay with having a bully in the group then that\u2019s on them, but you don\u2019t have to accept it.", "NTA by any means. Her life must have sucked. It's too bad she had to go through that. Wanting her kids to be miserable though... and you as well. It's the type of person that suffers through something, then tries to make everyone suffer as well. That's toxic. It's not a product of going through hard times, it's the product of thinking that you need to get revenge for what you went through. I do hope she finds peace and makes a better life for herself. And doesn't decide to abuse her future kids for absolutely no reason at all.", "Kathy trying to tell you that you seem oblivious to your privilege. Maybe she feels like you lorded it over her somehow. Maybe talk to her? ESH", "NTA\n\nKaty's jealousy and resentment of you and your situation has overwhelmed and destroyed your friendship.  That's on her, not you.", ">She passively-aggressively insulted you repeatedly - she poked the bear.\n\nshe fucked around and found out. OP, NTA", "Parental support is awesome.\n\nWhat's not awesome is the people with parental support being totally clueless about how the rest of us live.  (That doesn't sound like the case with OP, FWIW.)\n\nI get frustrated when I'm at a party and someone says, \"Anybody should be able to graduate college in four years,\" and I'm just thinking, \"It's clear who didn't have to work their way through school, and who didn't go to a big state school where the required classes just weren't available when you needed them.\"\n\nOr just generally not understanding that some folks have a nearly-empty wallet and need to watch their pennies.\n\n(Although, heaven help me, as I get older, I tend to forget this stuff myself.)\n\n\\[Edit:  NTA, in any case.  It doesn't sound like OP is rubbing it in Kathy's face or anything.\\]", "I\u2019ve never understood the attitude of, \u201cI suffered and so should you.\u201d At an extreme that\u2019s the reasoning that results in mothers holding their daughters down for FGM, to a lesser degree it also results in people being up in arms about student loan forgiveness. Suffering is not a virtue; it\u2019s an inescapable fact of life that doesn\u2019t need multiplying for a perverse kind of virtue signaling. \n\nYou are NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d needs to take a good look at her jealousy because it\u2019s clearly chewed her empathy down to the bone."]}
