About a week after his birthday, I received a message from my 18 year old son, who is currently away at college, about how over the summer he had suggested to Harvey that once he turns 18 he should ask me about moving in to our house and his now vacated bedroom.\n\nI live in a 5-bedroom house owned by my eldest son. As my kids have moved out and rooms have emptied, I've had various friends and family live with me. My 14 year old son is the only one of my kids left still living at home full-time. Two of my nieces live with me, with one of them being Harvey's 21 year old sister, Vanessa (and her 3 year old son). \n\nVanessa moved in with me a few months after graduating high school after she became pregnant with her son. \n\nAround 5 years ago, Harvey and Vanessa's mom married their stepdad. They have 3 step siblings (17/19/22) who they do not get on with and they have a awful relationship with their stepfather. \n\nTheir mom is incredibly strict. She's one of those parents that got into a lot of trouble as a teenager/young adult and now takes it out on her kids and always expects the worse from them. This leads to her being super controlling and giving them very little freedom. Even at 17 she never let Harvey sleepover at my house and in one incident last year where he was still in my house after 10pm during my son's birthday party, she barged into my house and basically dragged him out.\n\nMy brother (their dad) is on the opposite end of the spectrum and is basically a dead beat. He went to prison in 2009 and only got out in 2020. He's been struggling since then to form a good relationship with his kids, although it has been improving with Vanessa.\n\nI now somewhat regret saying yes after Harvey asked me if he could move in because it has created a lot of drama for the both of us. When he told his mom he was moving out she told him he couldn't and they got into a massive argument, but he did end up leaving. \n\nSince then, his mom has been spreading to other parents in town that I kidnapped her son and trying to spread misinformation about my parenting and \"neglect\". She's been telling people I allow my kids to do drugs and alcohol, encourage them to have sex, and barely feed them. She's trying to use it as an excuse about why both her kids now want to live with me. \n\nIt's been hard for Harvey too and his mom has been causing a lot of drama at his school. \n\nSeveral parents from the boy's school, even the ones that don't believe the rumours she's trying to spread about me, think I'm in the wrong. I got into a heated debate with one that essentially told me I was an asshole for getting in-between a parent trying to raise their son. Am I in the wrong for letting him move in before he graduates high school? Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1702234166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fabrz/aita_for_letting_my_nephew_move_in_with_me/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it might say something about how it could go bad for her if she continues to badmouth you to anybody that will listen? \n\nA lawyer would know how to make it sound legal and nice. And it sounds like it would be a good idea to have an established relationship with a lawyer anyway, since somebody from CPS,  or child custody,  or who knows who, might want to talk to you.\n\nNo good deed, and all that. I am sorry. NTA", "NTA. You are a hero to your niece and nephew, and rewarding the guilty (the mother) is punishing the innocent at this point. How far will she go if you give in now? I can\u2019t imagine that being a healthy or safe environment for your nephew to go back to. And at which age is he \u201callowed\u201d to leave without these consequences following him?", "NTA. Harvey's mother has finished her raising Harvey. He is 18 and not comfortable with her parenting style. If she wanted him to stay in her home after his 18th birthday, she would have had to make it bearable to be there. I hope you hold your heads up high and ignore the gossips and the rumour mongers. Remember that the best revenge is to live well.", "NTA. Document document document. That mother is controlling as all hell. You are a hero for getting Harvey out of there. You need to try and get a paper trail of all of the shit his mother is pulling. Harvey is an adult now, so there\u2019s not much she can do, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to take any chances. I\u2019d recommend having Harvey go to your local police station and explain the situation. Have him tell them that he is voluntarily staying at your house, and that if his mother tries to say that you kidnapped him, she\u2019s lying. Have him go alone, and make sure it happens before his mother tries to file any sort of police reports. If she starts trying to show up at your house, get a restraining order. Good luck friend", "NTA. SIL sounds horrible and she\u2019s driving her kids away from her. You did good by helping your nephew with a safe harbor until he graduates and moves on with the rest of his life.", "NTA. I don't really understand this house of charity you have going on, but good on you for offering young people a safe space.\n\nAs the young adult is now 18 he can make certain decisions for himself, including where he lives. Assumes certain right of age laws. As long as he is able to maintain school and any other requirements then it's his choice.\n\nI don't think I would engage with the rumors and whatever other bullshit beyond sending a certified letter demanding the cessation of spreading falsehoods about you immediately and that you have already suffered due to them, setting the stage for legal action. Again, assumes certain laws in place depending on where you live. Honestly, you don't have a relationship worth maintaining with this woman, so, light the fuse.", "NTA. Harvey is legally an adult who chose to live in your house, and could choose to live anywhere that isn\u2019t under her roof as soon as he turned 18.", "Nta. You helped him get out of an abusive household. There is no way she treats those kids right", "NTA - if she has the audacity to say those lies about you publicly I can\u2019t imagine how she treats her children in the privacy of their home. It must be awful and it\u2019s no wonder they don\u2019t want to live with her and you\u2019re changing their lives for the better by letting them live with you.", "Excuse me, Harvey is 18, a legal adult, and has made the choice to live with you. His Mom sounds like a walking migraine. If she persists with the slander and mud-slinging have your attorney send her a strongly worded cease-and-desist letter, you do still have minor child in the house and that trash talk could affect them. NTA", "First of all, NTA. Your house, your rules, your guests. By the looks of it, their mom is out of her her mind, and their dad is absent at best. As family he came to you for your help, and as family you gave it. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with that.

The son is 18 and was in a clearly abusive home. The mom is upset because she knows it makes her look bad and is trying to protect her image.

Block her, and be done with her.", "NTA- you\u2019re awesome for being there for your niece and nephew. \n\nThe kid is an adult and his mother is lashing out because she lost her control over him.", "NTA, this is a case of \"no good action will stay unpunished\" but your nephew is 18 and the mother is clearly neglectful and doesn't care about her kids, otherwise she wouldn't go around spreading the kind of lies that could a) make people in town refuse a job to nephew and b) bring CPS to your door for your niece", " Nta", "NTA Those poor kids. You gave them a safe space and you will always have their gratitude. As for people giving you their unwanted opinions tell them there are always two sides to every story and if they knew the truth they\u2019d change their minds in a hurry. I also agree that you should be documenting things involving your SIL as they happen and I think a Cease and Desist letter from a lawyer is a great idea. I gave a couple of my kids\u2019 hs friends shelter from bad situations and they\u2019ve never forgotten. Not that that is what\u2019s important but it meant a lot to them.", "NTA Harvey's mom sounds abusive, abuse isn't always physical, my partners parents were exactly like Harvey's mom, they wanted full authority over him even at 20 and he felt like he couldn't be himself or feel safe and comfortable at home till he moved out, your doing the right thing and it sounds like you an awesome person, don't let thay woman bully you, her authoritarian ways chased her kids away", "NTA OP.  Just because Harvey\u2019s still in high school doesn\u2019t make him any less of a grown ass man.  I had classmates in high school who were already eligible to vote in that year\u2019s elections, so contact an attorney and file a restraining order against his mom so that she has to stay away from y\u2019all.  Better yet, go with him and have him file the restraining order, so that you are covered in case she tries to pull something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hopefully things work out for all of you.  \n\n\nAs for that kid who told you that you were wrong for interfering with Harvey's mother raising him... he's just flat out wrong, and clearly has no idea what he's talking about.

He's 18, he's allowed to move Out of his mother's household If he hates it there, she's supposed to be done \"raising\" him,you are Not \"taking him away\" by letting him move in, you are keeping him Safe.

From what I understand, they wouldn't anyway because it isn't the kind situation they would interfere in.\n\nOP, tell anyone that puts their nose into it to, bluntly, butt out.  They clearly don't understand the situation and obviously think the nephew isn't of legal age, which he is.

You\u2019ve lived there for years, raised multiple children to successful adulthood, and even his sister has been living there for three years with her child.\n\nThe only person creating instability is the person trying to rock the boat and then blame you for it.\n\nHarvey is 18.\n\nHer time to parent her child is over. Now if a child and parent have a good relationship a child will still seek out advice and support - that clearly isn\u2019t going to be the case here.\n\nAnd it\u2019s going to be his mother\u2019s fault. \n\nIt might be worth consulting a lawyer, particularly with the accusations that are criminal in nature.", "NTA. OP, Harvey was in a miserable, abusive situation, and by giving him shelter you got him out of it. Now he can begin to heal. \n\n>told me I was an asshole for getting in-between a parent trying to raise their son\n\nThis person just implicitly admitted that they think parents have the right to abuse their children.

Neither is Harvey who is 18 and a LEGAL ADULT.  Your sister tells him he can't move?  No wonder her kids wanted out.  I think you've gone beyond the call of duty helping her kids escape from her.  You could find some legal aid if you can't afford an attorney to send her a cease and desist letter because she is slandering and libeling you.", "NTA. Although Harvey is in school he is still legally an adult. He made the decision to move out and there is nothing his mom can do about it. Harvey can always go to a different school and you can sue her for slander.", "NTA - and when people start talking to you about it, be honest. \u201cMy niece and nephew live with me because their mother is abusive and controlling. Even now she\u2019s spreading lies and misinformation to try and force me to kick Harvey out so he has no where else to go. They\u2019re adults and chose to run away from her as soon as they turned 18 because of how abusive she is\u2026 are you saying I should kick out adults so they are forced to go back to their abuser?\u201d\n\nWatch how fast these people start back peddling.", "NTA, but geez, I can see why Harvey moved out the minute he turned 18 if this is how his mom reacts to not getting her way in every minor thing. This isn't about being \"strict\", it's about being controlling and punitive. Who talks that away about their own child, and to all the other parents?\n\nUnfortunately I don't think there's much you can do here. Evicting Harvey won't magically heal the rift between him and his dreadful mother. Plus, he's 18, it's not kidnapping. Tell the other parents that he had already decided to move out, and you did the kind deed of offering him a home so he had somewhere to go.", "NTA i hope to be like you some day /genuine", "NTA", "And Harvey needs to go to his school, explain that he is now an adult and ban them from having any discussion about him with his mother", "You should either contact your SIL and tell her that what she is doing is defaming you, and if she doesn't cut it out, you'll hire a lawyer and sue her, or just start with the lawyer. I don't mean that you should leap straight to filing suit, but it really shouldn't cost much to have a lawyer write a cease-and-desist letter.\n\nIn the meantime, document EVERYTHING.\n\nAlso, you are definitely NTA. You are clearly someone who has provided a safe and loving place to land for more than one young relative, and I can only imagine how grateful they are to have you in their lives. The world could use more people like you.", "Hi OP, good on you for being a safe haven for your niblings! More people like you and there would be fewer problems.\n\nI have a couple of suggestions:\n- Carry a notebook with you. Any time someone says anything about the situation, whip it out and start questioning them ...\n- What have you heard? What exactly?\n- Who said that to you?\n- Can you remember when?\n- Was there anyone else present? Who - do you know their full name?\n- Can I have your details for if we need to call you for a deposition?\n\nIf they ask what you're doing, tell them: I was advised to collect details of as many witnesses as possible on this matter. Fortunately, or unfortunately, there are *many* witnesses to this ongoing pattern of behaviour.\n\nIf they continue to ask why, in an ominous tone of voice: At the very *least*, we're looking at defamation. I've also been told not to say anything further, so I'll just zip it... for now. Thank you so much for your help today. Is it okay to follow up with you if needed? All we'd want is for you to tell the truth.\n\nThe idea of defamation proceedings will spread like wildfire. Hopefully getting exSIL to stop running her mouth. \n\nIt's also a really good tool for shutting down the judgemental types - hooking their behaviour into possible legal action.\n\nAnd if you need it, you'll already have the names of witnesses.\n\nI hope this helps. Good luck OP!", "Ironically, should she do this and Harvey and Vanessa tell CPS what was going on at home before they moved out... CPS maybe investigating her remaining household and how her stepchildren are treated (probably very well) but she will still be questioned."]}
