My best friend Katie  is planning the bachelorette party. I had not officially asked her yet to be my maid of honor but it was assumed. We\u2019ve been friends since Kindergarten and talked about this our whole lives. Prior to meeting my fiance we had quite a party lifestyle and Katie always joked around about this being the last hoorah.\n\nWe were going over the guest list to the bachelorette and I explained I wanted my mother in law and my fianc\u00e9s brothers wives to attend. So an additional 3 people. I let her know I had told them they were invited. \n\nKatie said she didn\u2019t want them there because the activities wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. So I said that\u2019s okay and we can find something else to do and that if anyone paid any deposits or any cancellation fees I\u2019d give her the money spent back. \n\nAfter some arguing Katie said I\u2019m taking all her work for granted and that she was done. I wasn\u2019t sure if she said that out of anger (that would be typical for her) or not so I called one of my future sister in laws, Jess, and just needed to vent. Jess said she\u2019d come over and we\u2019d figure it out. Jess called my other future sister in law, Ashley, and they came over with my mother in law and we planned a whole new bachelorette party in a couple hours. (I\u2019m actually really excited for it.)\n\nThey really saved the day. I had a conversation with my fiance and asked if he\u2019d think it was weird if I asked them both to be my maid of honors instead. They were both already going to be bridesmaids and their husbands are my fianc\u00e9s best men. My fiance said he thinks they\u2019d really love that and it would help us bond more. So the next day I officially asked them both at family dinner in front of my in laws, fiance, his brothers, and some extended family. We all cried and none of us have sisters so we all joked about how we finally had them. \n\nMy future sister in laws posted pictures to social media and captioned it \u201cAll the (insert last name) girls. We can\u2019t wait to spend this special day with our newest sister.\u201d \n\nKatie saw this and flipped out on me about how I\u2019m just replacing her and how I don\u2019t even care about her feelings. She said I\u2019m throwing away our friendship over girls who haven\u2019t been there for me my whole life. And how could I just replace her role on the most important day of my life within 24 hours. Katie even commented on the post saying \u201cthe betrayal\u201d. \n\nKatie is making me feel like such an AH. My fiance thinks Katie is overreacting and for me not to worry about it. I just want someone\u2019s opinion who unbiased. AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nI had a conversation with my husband and we\u2019ve read most of the comments. He agrees that under no circumstances would we tell my sister in laws that they wouldn\u2019t be the maid of honors anymore. They\u2019ve been nothing but wonderful, supportive, and helpful. And we also took into the consideration that maybe Katie and I are just drifting apart and growing differently. \n\nI did call Katie and tell her that I love her, appreciate her, and want nothing but the best for her always but that I am going to keep my sister in laws as my maid of honor and that I want her to be my bridesmaid more than anything but I understand if she doesn\u2019t want to be.\n\nKatie said she still wants to be a bridesmaid but she\u2019s hurt and feels like I\u2019ll replace her with them. \nWe talked and I don\u2019t know where our friendship will end up but it seems like right now we\u2019re okay.

You didn't want that but rather than saying that explicitly you invited family members. For Katie this probably felt like you were flipping the script on what you guys talked about for years. Katie got unreasonably angry, probably because she's been thinking about an anticipating this event for years. Neither of you extended the olive branch to talk. You planned with other people and iced Katie out, which has compounded any bad feelings that existed.\n\nSo do you want this friendship to still be a thing or not?", "Just by reading op comments, you can see how insufferable she is.

You threw over your best friend since Kindergarden, who always looked forward to this day with you, who had your back, who put in a lot of planning work for your bachelorette party, who you both assumed would be your maid of honor..just to \u201cbond with\u201d your future sisters in law, and impress your soon to be family. It sounds like you are pretty fickle. Even to call your future sister in law to \u201cvent\u201d is a betrayal. To replace her as a maid of honor and let her find out about it on social media is cruel. Why couldn\u2019t you both have figured out some modifications to the already planned bachelorette party, if you had to have these three new family members added? You didn\u2019t respect her investment of work in it at all. Or leave the three out of this one and let them plan a smaller family bachelorette event for you in addition? You have not treated your old friend well at all, OP. You know what they say-make new friends, but keep the old.

Yeah, YTA. \n\nI am also engaged right now and gave the MOH/Best Man clear expectations of what we were aiming for and who would be invited. Couldn\u2019t imagine changing that up on them after they\u2019ve put hard work into it already.

Not that she was done as a maid of honor. But you made it so much worse than it needed to be. Either shift the nature of the event, or drop a few raunchy activities, or tell her gently that it\u2019s not what you want anymore.

Why ask?", "INFO: Did you hear Katie explicitly say she was resigning from MOH, or was \"I'm done\" a quote? Did you ask her what she meant by that?

She knows you by heart. You told her on last minute you invite people who don\u2019t share the same fun as you and you ask her to abandon all plans : was it so difficult for you to go to restaurant with your in laws ??\nAnd you replace your best friend without any regret ? Sure, you\u2019ve never been a friend to her\u2026", "Wow, so you let Katie, your bf whose been there for you for years, plan the whole party.

I hope your friend never speaks to you again. You suck. YTA", "The only thing I can add here reading through your story and all these comments. Clearly YTA for not being clear with what you wanted and not discussing who you want to be at the party. Furthermore you suck for just replacing your best friend. Does your friendship really mean that much if you can just cast her away like that, not just sit and talk like adults. You definitely need to apologise and for the sake of your friendship make her the maid of honour.", "YTA Honestly it's weird to me to invite your MIL to your bachelorette party in the first place. Katie should have been more amenable to switching up the plan, but you KNEW what type of party she'd plan when you asked her to do it, you'd talked about for a while, AND the worst part is you let her find out you didn't give a shit about her efforts on Facebook.

Jess called my other future sister in law, Ashley, and they came over with my mother in law and we planned a whole new bachelorette party in a couple hours.

I had a conversation with my fiance and asked if he\u2019d think it was weird if I asked them both to be my maid of honors instead. They were both already going to be bridesmaids and their husbands are my fianc\u00e9s best men. My fiance said he thinks they\u2019d really love that and it would help us bond more.

There were so many ways to handle this without being a cold-hearted jerk and you instead chose the nuclear option. Katie is well within her rights to have feelings and be upset by your actions. When you get divorced your new found sisters are guaranteed to cut you out to keep the peace. Yes, when. Someone as cruel and immature as you is unlikely to have the skills necessary to maintain a lifelong commitment. Clearly. As we've all seen with your demonstration towards your alleged best friend of decades.", "I was going to vote ESH, but after reading your comments, YTA, OP. It sounds like your friend went out of her was to plan something you talked about for years, as a surprise for you. You flipped the script on her completely and just threw her away.

OP states she was going over the list and who she wanted invited. Katie was never officially mad MOH. Despite this, OP was actively going over details. Katie said she didn't want them there because it would be inappropriate.\n\nIt is clear Katie had an agenda and made OP's wedding about herself.", "I just didn\u2019t think it was a big deal since she said she was done.", "Yes, it sounds like you are so excited about your new family, your friend's feelings just don't matter anymore.

If your marriage doesn\u2019t succeed sil will side with their brother and you\u2019ll be left alone", "I think they are both the fianc\u00e9\u2019s brothers wives", "It never fails to amaze me how women are willing to toss their friends aside over a guy.", "And extra to add on, Katie saying \u201cI\u2019m done, means I\u2019m done planning this party\u201d,  not I\u2019m done with the friendship. But way for OP to not clarify\u2026 and the thing with how she basically said it\u2019s not appropriate is she\u2019s implying what Katie does is inappropriate. \n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve found is that those who stick their nose up in the air and judge others for things like that are actually the lowest in class.", "I can conceed MIL is probably not a given, but SILs? I've only been to a handful of bachelorette parties but when there were SILs they were always invited. Bride's mom was always invited too (if it was more than just the bridesmaids invited), which might not be common? So I might be coming at this from a less common lived experience.", "In my family we usually do but only for the first part which is tame like a dinner before going out and only if it\u2019s a really good relationship.", "OP is so focused on being Mrs. His Last Name that she\u2019s lost sight of everyone who has been there for her prior to finding a man, including her own family and former bff. \n\nA sad but common tale.", "They won\u2019t be there after the divorce!", "OP is clearly not capable of introspection and doesn't agree with the overwhelming majority calling her out", "Okay then. Technically, if they're married they are not maids of honor, but matrons of honor. If we're using the words within their historical meaning, at least. So, tell your future SILs that since they're married you need them to be your matrons of honor, which leaves you in need of a maid of honor, which brings you back to Katie. Maybe you can salvage your family relationships AND your friendship. Then you and the officiant can get creative about how to position them during the ceremony.", "LOL your update is funny, you do realize the friendship is over right?\n\nYou cant be this oblivious to that?", "Idk why... OP knew the type of party Katie was preparing because they talked about it and prepared for it they're whole upbringing as OP stated. OP realized she didn't want that type of party any longer because she wanted to act brand new and impress her new family members.  That's why she last minute invited them and then try to throw it at Katie in which Katie responded Having them there would be inappropriate. \nNext day Katie finds out through Social Media not only is she not hosting the Bachelorette party but she lost her title role in the whole wedding.  OP claims they grew up together but she treated her like that?", "so maybe dont come in guns blazing if you dont have all the facts....", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gender related. It happened many more times to my (male) partner than it happened to me. The moment one if his mates finally got into a serious relationship, they vanished, until they needed a groomsman. And then vanished again.\n\nI think it\u2019s more a question of age/maturity. \n\nIf you are 16, you\u2019ll drop everything for \u201cthe boy of your dreams\u201d. If you are a few decades older mentally and physically,  there were definitely several boys of your dreams that have come and gone, and now you know that friendships are more valuable than you thought they are when you were 16.", "It might depend on the country, idk. I lived in several countries, in different continents (albeit all considered \u201cWestern\u201d, I won\u2019t comment on the traditions in other areas). \n\nIn some places the MOB was invited, in others not. Same for the SILs.\n\nThe MILs were very rarely included, only if the MOB was invited too. Having either at a hen do is a tad weird for me \u2026 but again, it\u2019s a cultural thing.", "she\u2019s so blind right now. They are the shiny new toys and forget everyone else who has always been there for her", "In kindergarten, right?", "That is nobody's point. No wishes bad on you and your relationship,but every relationship has its up and downs. As they his family, they likely to take his side in an argument and then who will you have to be on your side?\n\nLife is not a movie where you can be the worst and should things not work out for you, then you expect that your friend will be the bigger person and forgive you. \n\nEven after the wedding may be too late to salvage this. You breaking trust here and deep down you expecting that this won't have any consequences.\n\nIf you really drifting after, this isn't the place to burn that bridge. You could have just became busy with life as a wife and mother and I am sure she would have understood.\n\nNow damage control. Go to her and apologise. Ask her for ideas to get out of this as well. I mean it is your blunder but there's no way you not getting out of here as not being the AH to either your friend or your in-laws. However maybe you can still salvage the friendship by including her input. \n\nBTW: You made a massive mistake acting on the high of your in-laws generosity. It's a lesson we can all learn from this that as much as you don't act impulsively when things are bad, not in good either.\n\nYou currently trying to reconcile yourself even though you know you acted impulsively. I foresee the only way you can solve this is by speaking to your friend, telling her that you don't know how to get out of this without disappointing your in-laws (and telling her how much you royally screwed up) and asking her how you can make it right with her.", "How do you not see how much this sucks? It sounds like you didn't even give her a chance to plan anything else before just freezing her out. Man, if I were Katie I'd probably find something else to do on your wedding day. You are not a good friend.", ">OP is clearly not capable of introspection\n\nyou mean OP and her fiance seeing that she cant make any choices without his input", "It\u2019s not my family. I\u2019m not OP", "Right? Also the wording is super interesting: her fiance is controlling this whole thing and she\u2019s letting him. I mean if that\u2019s the dynamic she wants fine. \u201cWe took into consideration\u201d you mean your husband doesn\u2019t want you to be friends with her.", "Uhg. I try not to judge what other people do. But these plus DH are super irritating. If you marry someone, it's just generally assumed that you like them. Or at least it should be. Coming", "I love being reminded that my experiences aren't necessarily the norm!\n\nI'm pretty \"close\" I guess is the word with a lot of my friends' moms,  now that we're adults (let's say around the time I graduated college). Now it's just like, that's another women that I enjoy spending time with so it's not really super weird for me to be in this type of situation with them. In fact, these are ladies I'd invite to my own bachelorette party, if it was one with more than a couple folks. \n\nThat said, I shouldn't be surprised that's kind of weird! Thinking about it, I can see why this might not be the norm. Relationships don't evolve the same way.\n\nLoving this right now because it's reminding me of some fun times I've had plus reminding me that other dynamics exist.", "Yeah... I hate to say it but the more we hear the less respect I have for OP and their SO.\n\nPoor Katie. I hope you have other friends, Katie.", "Hmm you said it", "It was not my intention to invalidate your experiences! I only wanted to say things/traditions are different from country to country (and from person to person).\n\nYou are lucky to be so close to your MIL and it says a lot of positive things about you and her as individuals.\n\nI referenced culture because in many countries a hen do is a night-long party that middle age persons would not be able to attend, not due to the lack of a good relationship, simply due to all the craziness such a party entails.Heck, at mine I ended up having to carry hone some if my friends and deal with the aftermath that cones with excessive drinking, and we were in our mid 20s :-) I was the only one left standing and relatively sober, so it was a very long night for me. I can\u2019t imagine my mum or the MIG putting up with all that mess. :-)", "Oh no, I didn't think it was invalidating at all but thank you for considering that! \n\nThe points you made gave me the opportunity to remind myself situations (and definitely cultures!) are different. It's easy to not even see where differences might be. Sometimes someone has to poke me a little to remind me. I appreciate both your comments and the way you made them. I never felt disrespected or invalidated. You do a great job of sharing differences without discouraging other people's thoughts and experiences.", "Thank you, I\u2019m glad I did not come across as being rude! And your reply was lovely."]}
