Without going into too much detail about his injuries, he needed someone staying with him and helping him get around for a while. I do freelance work from home to support myself, so they asked me if I could go and stay in their home for a while as her partner's temporary caregiver while he recovered. I immediately agreed, wanting to help in any way I could. \n\nHer partner and I were already good friends prior to this situation, but living with someone and being there in some of their most intimate moments obviously strengthens a bond even further. We bonded over our many shared interests and got to talk about deeper things that were typically off limits in a group setting. By the time I realized my changing feelings, it was too late to distance myself from the situation. I had committed to helping him for the duration of his recovery and a sudden change in my behavior would just tip him off that something was wrong and add unnecessary stress to an already hard time. He had expressed feeling like a burden more than once. So, I pulled away the little bit I could and we rode out those last few weeks together before he was back on his feet again.\n\nTo make a long story short, the period that followed was full of guilt from me and confusion from my sister's partner by my quick disappearance following our time together. He eventually texted me and asked if he had done something wrong during our time together and pissed me off somehow, so we met up and I came clean. The conversation was a brutal one and it eventually ended in both of us agreeing we would limit our time together from now on as there was no hope for an actual future for us - it would simply be too weird given the history.\n\nFast forward to now. The two of them got engaged somewhat recently and this past Saturday, my sister asked me to be in her wedding as part of her bridal party. I asked her to let me think about it (which already caused some tension) and finally told her yesterday that I was incredibly grateful for her offer but I had to turn it down. I'm fine attending as a guest, but being in the party just feels too much. She is now furious with me and is demanding I give her an explanation at the very least, something I have refused.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Addressing comments/questions \u2014 he did reciprocate my feelings. They didn\u2019t have a traditional proposal and my sister is the one who initiated the conversations. In response to inquiries about the status of their relationship now: he told me that he respects my sister and doesn\u2019t want to end the relationship abruptly with no real reason he can disclose. He has had relationships with men in the past and she knows this. He and I text occasionally but not often at all.", "created_utc": 1670380100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeplpi/aita_for_refusing_my_sisters_offer_to_be_in_her/", "score": 4780, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm no psychologist, so with a grain of salt, but I do believe there are many sorts of bonds that people can form when there's a relationship or dynamic of helpless-helper. I think sometimes that dynamic lead to interdependence which can lead to feelings of attachment, romantic or otherwise. Maybe you just really like feeling needed, and he likes aspects of being taken care of or nursed in some way. These sorts of bonds can be intense, but often unhealthy.\nOverall, nta for developing feelings, as that's outside of your control. \nAs to whether you should inform your sister of this emotional affair you two had is trickier.

Because you will have to torpedo your relationship with your sister to keep that distance.", "I love how everyone is ignoring the initial question and just judging you for your actions prior to denying her broad party offer. All in all, clearly you shouldn\u2019t go so TECHNICALLY NTA, but this entire situation has started because of your AH decision to tell him you had feelings", "YTA aa is the fiance. My heart breaks for your sistee.", "Unpopular opinion, but NTA. It\u2019s not your fault that you developed feelings, and you did absolutely everything in your power to limit contact so as not to do anything that would have been disrespectful of your sister despite these feelings. It\u2019s not her partners fault that they reciprocated your feelings, because it is very possible to be in love with more than one person without detracting from the other. And despite those reciprocal feelings they too decided it was best to acknowledge the elephant in the room\u2019s existence briefly and then move on from it to never speak of it again. All because you BOTH love and care about your sister and her feelings. You both handled this beyond respectfully, and it shows how much you both care about your sister that you\u2019d never walk down such a road that would have disrespected her and her trust in you. But let\u2019s pretend none of that ever happened, and your sister asked you to be in the wedding party for her to marry an individual you don\u2019t have feelings for. And you still said no thank you. Would that require an explanation? No. Because NO is a complete sentence. Conflicting emotions aside, wedding planning is a NIGHTMARE and I wish it upon no one.

So here's the thing. Florence Nightengale syndrome is a thing, where someone giving care falls in love with their patient. Transference is also a thing, where a patient falls in love with their caregiver.\n\nThey're all feelings based on the fact that aspects of caring for a person, or being cared for, in a medical situation are, by nature, extremely intimate. I'm not saying both of your feelings boil down to simply this, but it literally sounds like the classic presentation of both. It's a trope for a reason. \ud83d\ude05\n\nYou talked about it like adults, were honest, and you both decided to walk away.

It is concerning that OP still feels strongly enough that he feels he can\u2019t be part of the bridal party, and I encourage OP to explore why that is. I do think that OP should be honest to his sister about having developed feelings for her fianc\u00e9 and allowing her agency in how their relationship will progress. It may seem like raising unnecessary drama over something that never happened, but it\u2019s better to be open now, when walking away is still relatively easy. The issue is that sometimes when we try to protect people, we inadvertently deny them their agency in the matter. \n\nOP isn\u2019t the AH for developing feelings and not wanting to be in the bridal party. But he would be the AH if he isn\u2019t honest with his sister and if he doesn\u2019t put in the work to get over those feelings.", "YTA - developing feelings is understandable but you should have left it and stuck to your word in creating distance by not admitting your feelings to the fianc\u00e9. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 would have ended up acting out in other ways and made it obvious to the sister something was up. You jumped the gun in admitting your feelings resulting in bonding you and your sisters fianc\u00e9 with a secret. That\u2019s dishonest and unfair to your sister and something she should know so she can make a decision about whether she wants to marry him knowing this.\n\nYou could have let it go away by dealing with your feelings but by you allowing both to acknowledge your feelings, you just created a situation to make it harder for you to get over the fianc\u00e9.

In the same vein, I hypothetically would not confess my love to a roommate\u2019s boyfriend if he asked why I wasn\u2019t spending as much time in the common areas with them.

She should also know if her fiance doesn't love her or also loves / loved someone else. It's unfair for her if she enters the marriage and he and her brother know more about the feelings involved than she does.

Please be honest with your sister and the sooner the better.", "YTA, but specifically for choosing not to be in the bridal party because it \"just feels too much.\"  For that to be the case, there has to be one of two scenarios:\n\n1. You and the fiance are able to control yourselves and continue not acting on your feelings, but being involved in the wedding makes you feel bad.  That's the price you pay for choosing not to tell your sister, you have to suck it up and deal with the discomfort.  It's a price you're going to be paying for as long as the three of you are alive and speaking to each other, because you're never going to be able to stop seeing your sister without an explanation.  Otherwise, you're just offloading pain and confusion onto her to avoid it for yourself, which is asshole behavior.  Realistic, but asshole.  Maybe over time those emotions fade, but you have to consider if you can endure that pain for potentially decades if they don't.  If not, telling her immediately, before they get married and before you have the chance to slip up is the only wise choice.\n\n2. You don't trust that either you or the fiance will be able to control yourselves and avoid acting on your feelings.  In which case you ABSOLUTELY need to tell her, because again you will be put into scenarios where you will be around each other for potentially decades.  Either you're going to slip up, or you're going to have to withdraw eventually and you'll again be leaving her in the dark.  \n\nThis is essentially the same dilemma you were faced with the fiance previously.  You had the choice of continuing to act normally without withdrawing, and bear the pain yourself until the feelings faded, or telling them.  You saved yourself the pain by offloading it onto them, and then confessed because it felt bad.  If you don't think you could sustain that situation, do you really think you can sustain the much higher stakes situation with your sister, and do you think the fiance can also?  Because the consequences will get much worse the longer you wait.\n\nYou're not the inherently AH for developing those feelings, the fiance isn't the AH for reciprocating them, and you seem to have limited your interactions since those feelings were expressed.  But you're not handling the long-term ramifications well, and honestly you're probably foolish to think that you can do so after getting in this deep without your sister finding out eventually.\n\nI swear, most of the time \"emotional affair\" is just shorthand for \"I want to shame you for failing to meet my standards of purity, but you haven't technically done anything wrong, so I'll accuse you of the theoretical crimes I'M SURE you really wanted to do.\"  \n\nIf AITA ever had to untangle the knot of former relationships, infinitely varied poly relationships, past-present-future hookups and friends-with-benefits, and intimate friendships that make up many gay social circles, the entire subreddit would burn to the ground so thoroughly that nothing would ever grow out of the ashes.", "YTA", "NTA for refusing obviously.\n\nBut you do know that it will end up with you two getting in a relationship behind her back, yeah?\n\nYou'll see each other on family holidays, vacation, and other barbecues and whatnot. \n\nThis will end up terribly for everyone.\n\nYour sister does deserve better than marrying a man who's going ahead with it because he sees it as easier.", "NTA.

OP was tending to his sisters SO when she couldn't. Realizes part of the way through that he's developing feelings. SO and OP talk about it and discover they've both let their hearts run away from them and back off because they see it's wrong and neither want a relationship. Now OP is avoiding SO because he doesn't want to be in a position where he may act on these feelings in the moment and hurt his sister while also giving himself the emotional distance to get over it. This seems a totally appropriate response. An emotional affair that makes OP an AH requires that he continues, not stop. And for everyone saying OPs an awful brother for this happening at all, you need to realize that sometimes people step in the proverbial shit and are knee deep before they even know they've stepped in it. We are all of us only human and are not in total control of our emotions at all times. We can't truly control our emotions only what we do about them. What did OP do? He backed off.\n\nAs for OPs actual question, is he an AH for not being in the wedding party and telling his sister what's going on. Well it's personal, embarrassing,  and really none of her business that he caught feeling for her soon to be husband since OP is not acting upon them. Some may argue that she deserves to know because it involves her soon to be husband. My thought to this is how does full disclosure help sister?

If you do decide to tell her the truth, you could leave it at \"I'm sorry, I developed feelings for your fiancee, and I know they're not appropriate.

If he feels this way about OP's sister, he needs to come clean. He doesn't really need to say that it's her brother he loves (he really shouldn't be with the OP even if he does leave her cleanly) but he does need to tell her how he feels and that he might be gay/bi and dealing with that.

It just says they bonded, what am I missing?", "You must be on a pretty high horse being able to control who you're chemically attracted too, hey? I have some friends who have partners I would consider attractive, they also happen to have similar interests which obviously makes them more attractive. Some have expressed interest in hanging out, because we'd honestly make great friends, but I just can't because I know it'd turn into a bigger crush.  This creates a very uncomfortable situation that I can't really win.. either I pull away, denying a friendship and being an asshole to the partner, or I move in closer becoming an asshole to my friend who has hinted at jealousy. There's no winning, same for OP. \n\nWhat exactly did they do wrong? They helped out a friend and sibling in need, unfortunately the circumstance made them attracted to the friend. They recognized this, and now they're in an impossible situation. They did the right thing and pulled away.\n\nAlso, from my experience *everyone* assumes everyone else has perfect emotional control and blames them for every little mistep, but is all too quick to blame thier own misteps on things that are our of thier control. We're animals, our brains produce chemicals that make us feel a certain way under certain circumstances. We don't always have control over what we *feel*, but we do have control of what we *do*.

She's confessed to him in private and they both agree to to respect your relationship and keep their hands to themselves and that the best thing to do going forward is that she stays away from him.  She then doesn't want to be a bridesmaid because there's too much risk involved but doesn't want to explin why because she's afraid it would cast suspicion on the fiancee who's been entirely faithful in all this.\n\nExactly where's the issue here?  They handled it like an adult and kept it quiet because telling the sister would cause more problems than it solves.  If OP is a chick this is exactly how adults handle these things.  Does it really make that much difference if OP is a dude instead?  The dynamic is exactly the same.", "You don't just ignore \"intense feelings\" as no big deal.  if I knew my sister's partner had intense feelings for someone else, I would tell her, wouldn't you? It sucks that op is the target of those feelings, but it doesn't change his obligation to his sister.\n\nYou don't get to decide what's important you other people, and because OPs sister would find it important, it's on OP to tell her. Keeping secrets like that is wrong and self serving, it has nothing to do with protecting his sister as it should be, its to protect himself.", "Unfortunately, a lot of people seem to take anything other than despising another person as wanting to be with them. It's all rather narcissistic.\n\nOP was asked why he distanced himself. He was honest about why. That's the end of his responsibility in that situation. I don't feel like he has a responsibility to tell his sister *only* because I feel like that responsibility falls on the fianc\u00e9's shoulders.

Distance does wonders for that.\n\nGoddamn we are humans not mindless beasts.  And I\u2019m a misanthrope!", "Yeah saying that OP is an AH for having an emotional affair is a ridiculous take. It was completely unintended, came out of a situation in which OP was helping him out after an accident, and seemingly sort of surprising that OP/they both started to feel that way. OP recognized the feelings, shared them, and they both realized they realistically don\u2019t have a future together. Honestly if anyone is an AH it\u2019s the sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 for feeling basically obligated to marry her even though he fell in love with someone else (who happens to be her brother\u2026 oof), because he feels he can\u2019t disclose what happened so the breakup would just seemingly come out of nowhere.\n\nThe only reason I think OP could be an AH is for not telling his sister, especially now that he knows the fianc\u00e9 shared his feelings and still wants to marry the sister because he doesn\u2019t see a way out. That\u2019s upsetting to know as a sibling imo. But it\u2019s definitely a tough situation and OP may benefit from consulting a therapist or something before having this very delicate awkward conversation.", "Yes and I think people are also ignoring that there was a deeply traumatic event here. OP\u2019s friend was seriously injured. Enough to need a live in care giver. Friend was dealing with the physical injury and probably some emotional difficulties. It\u2019s not unexpected for feelings to arise during intense situations like that, especially when two people become very enmeshed in a short period of time. That doesn\u2019t mean either of them are bad people.\n\nI also think that people who get so worked up over crushes need to work on their jealousy. I have crushes on people, including people we are both close to. My partner has crushes on people. We usually tell each other if it comes up in convo talking about that person, usually tease about it, and no concerns. The crushes almost always go away shortly or fade into the background as a pleasant feeling that doesn\u2019t compel any action. I\u2019m in a happy relationship of over a decade and the only person I know who doesn\u2019t have to deal with a butt ton of stressful jealousy popping up in my relationship. \n\nCrushes are normal. They don\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love your partner. They can be deeply influenced by life events like someone showing up for you in the way a romantic partner or platonic life partner might. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the sister not being able to be around after a traumatic accident created some emotional distance between sister and boyfriend. It\u2019s completely possible that that has been fully resolved and they are happy together now. IF boyfriend does not have romantic love for the sister and IF he\u2019s hiding that and still getting married then that\u2019s an AH move. But other than that, I don\u2019t see any AHs. Difficult situation for OP though.", "I get that boyfriend/fianc\u00e9e is bi (according to comments I was unaware of at the time) and the attraction was mutual, but it *still* sounds like it was handled responsibly.

Why does sister need to know if they aren\u2019t planning on doing anything or even allowing it to progress?\n\nI\u2019ve had crushes, I\u2019ve gotten over them.  I\u2019ve even had mutual crushes and I and the other party has gotten over them.  Why is everyone treating this as fait accompli? People can be in love and have crushes on other people.  Human feelings aren\u2019t as monogamous as we want to be and we can choose fidelity.  It sounds like that\u2019s what fianc\u00e9 is doing and OP respects that.
