I'm no psychologist, so with a grain of salt, but I do believe there are many sorts of bonds that people can form when there's a relationship or dynamic of helpless-helper. I think sometimes that dynamic lead to interdependence which can lead to feelings of attachment, romantic or otherwise. Maybe you just really like feeling needed, and he likes aspects of being taken care of or nursed in some way. These sorts of bonds can be intense, but often unhealthy.\nOverall, nta for developing feelings, as that's outside of your control. \nAs to whether you should inform your sister of this emotional affair you two had is trickier.

It\u2019s not your fault that you developed feelings, and you did absolutely everything in your power to limit contact so as not to do anything that would have been disrespectful of your sister despite these feelings.

You have a year to get your feelings together.  You have a year to let go of your feelings for this guy.  The reason you are not, is because you sound a bit self-centered.  \n\nHe's decided against you and decided to marry someone else. Do whatever ceremony/therapy you need to do to let go of him.

He fell in love, and yes, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have told the guy, but that\u2019s really the worst that\u2019s happened. Both dudes who confessed their doomed love (*sob*) decided to stay away from each other, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done. It was the right thing to do.

You are both actively robbing her of her informed consent and the truth of the situation to protect yourselves. \n\nYou both should have come clean the second you had the conversation about reciprocated feelings. She deserves so much better from both of you, but you in particular. \n\nOP, you're her *brother*. She is your family, where is your loyalty? I could never do this my sister. In fact, it wouldn't get this far because my BIL, even before he was officially my BIL, has always been firmly in the family box. I do not and will never consider him a man that is romantically available to me, the same way my brothers and cousins aren't. That's how you ought to have been treating your *sister's husband* to be. Not as someone you could pursue yourself via an emotional affair which, make no mistake, is exactly what you did the minute your poor sister's back was turned.\n\nYou should have moved out the second you started to get inappropriately close to her partner while you were living under her roof.\n\nTell your sister, before your behaviour causes more chaos and she enters into a legally binding arrangement with another person that's been lying to her.

OP took care of his sister\u2019s injured boyfriend, and where they were friends before, their friendship grew and strengthened based on platonic similarities.\n\nOP developed feelings for the sister\u2019s boyfriend, and pulled away emotionally as soon as he realized his feelings.  Boyfriend thought he had made a great friend and couldn\u2019t understand why he pulled away.  There was no emotional affair, there was a friendship where one party developed a crush and removed himself as much as possible.\n\nOP finally came clean, and boyfriend values his personhood and friendship enough to have a conversation and agree that these feelings cannot be reciprocated - either because boyfriend isn\u2019t attracted to men, or because of his feelings for the sister and the history there that would make any attempt doomed, anyway.  So they both agree to halt the friendship and pull back, and to keep the situation between them so as not to cause extra drama.  They\u2019ve managed getting past it until sister wants to know why he won\u2019t stand by her at her wedding - which he can\u2019t do because he isn\u2019t over this guy.\n\nThat\u2019s how I\u2019m reading it?

Which is pretty bad all on it's own.", "I completely missed that OP was a guy.", "My point remains the same. You can't help what you feel for people. You can only control what you do about it. And just because he feels the same as OP does, that doesn't preclude that he no longer loves his fiancee. But he is *choosing* to remain faithful to her and they are doing the right thing by keeping their distance and not fostering the feelings.", "The feeling was mutual and the fiance decided to marry OP's sister anyway. \n\nThis isn't just two queer dudes talking feelings - As soon as a third party is involved, it gets more complicated than just confessing feelings. Their orientation doesn't entitle them to be quiet about this when one of them is getting married to the other's sister and doesn't tell her.\n\nBesides, while OP doesn't say that there was anything physical going on, that doesn't mean it wasn't.

Wow. You would have pushed it if it wasn't family right? It looks okay for you to insert yourself in a potential long term relationship and then go radio silent cause image is more important. \nYou should be ashamed, not for your feelings but the way you're handling them.
