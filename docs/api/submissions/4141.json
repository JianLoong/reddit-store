I'm no psychologist, so with a grain of salt, but I do believe there are many sorts of bonds that people can form when there's a relationship or dynamic of helpless-helper. I think sometimes that dynamic lead to interdependence which can lead to feelings of attachment, romantic or otherwise. Maybe you just really like feeling needed, and he likes aspects of being taken care of or nursed in some way. These sorts of bonds can be intense, but often unhealthy.\nOverall, nta for developing feelings, as that's outside of your control. \nAs to whether you should inform your sister of this emotional affair you two had is trickier.

It\u2019s not your fault that you developed feelings, and you did absolutely everything in your power to limit contact so as not to do anything that would have been disrespectful of your sister despite these feelings.

The issue is that sometimes when we try to protect people, we inadvertently deny them their agency in the matter. \n\nOP isn\u2019t the AH for developing feelings and not wanting to be in the bridal party.

I believe my last comment got removed for the colorful language I used in giving hypothetical scenarios, but I\u2019ll just say that there are some kinds of people who would propose to one person while having feelings for their sibling. (Not that I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, there\u2019s no evidence of that, I\u2019m just answering your question.)\n\nFianc\u00e9 pressed OP for trying to distance himself (indicating that he wanted to continue in close proximity to the person he developed a crush on during his partner\u2019s absence), and reciprocated in confessing feelings. By confessing first, OP made it impossible for their relationships with each other and with OP\u2019s sister to remain completely unaffected/intact. In my opinion, these actions make them both TA in this scenario. In the same vein, I hypothetically would not confess my love to a roommate\u2019s boyfriend if he asked why I wasn\u2019t spending as much time in the common areas with them. Because if found out this could obviously change the dynamic with someone I\u2019m close to and have dire consequences on the relationship. Risking that in the first place is AH territory in my opinion. You might not agree, that\u2019s okay", "[removed]", "Genuine question, what constitutes an emotional affair then? You keep saying it\u2019s being used wrong in the thread without explaining. I hate when people use \u201cgaslight\u201d wrong so if you can enlighten us I\u2019d genuinely be interested in hearing you out.", "[That\u2019s literally the definition of an emotional affair](https://imgur.com/a/GebNMb7)", "I have said that I think OP should be honest with his sister. She deserves to know, so she can have an honest talk with her fianc\u00e9 about their relationship. But I don\u2019t think OP is the AH for developing feelings or for having admitted them. I think it is deeply unfair and egregiously inaccurate to accuse him of having an emotional affair.", "Where does it say that OP confessed to get it off his chest? It\u2019s not in the OP, so if it\u2019s in a comment, please link it.\n\nI do think that OP should tell his sister why he can\u2019t be in her wedding party, but I also under why he is hesitant. It\u2019s a lot to dump on a wife-to-be and seems like a lot of drama over something that never happened. That said, I agree that the sister should know, because it\u2019s the rest of her life, and she should at least talk to her fianc\u00e9 and make sure their relationship is solid.", "It's true that people are down voting him a lot and that he seems to try to make up for telling her fiance.\n\nPerhaps people are frustrated that he doesn't tell his sister (I certainly am) or that he kept important info out of his post. This sub can be brutal when people think someone is trying to look better by leaving stuff out", "I can think of a couple reasons why he might marry her even though he has feelings for someone else.\n\nSociety's expectations, treatment of queer people, not wanting to tell the family he fell for her brother, not wanting to hurt her and hoping it would just go away, he is getting over his feelings and loves her, too.\n\nI do think that honesty is important for a relationship, so she should know why her brother distances himself from both of them and doesn't want to participate in the wedding. She should also know if her fiance doesn't love her or also loves / loved someone else. It's unfair for her if she enters the marriage and he and her brother know more about the feelings involved than she does. Keeping that from her is still a betrayal of trust. \n\nI don't think it was that long ago btw. Getting over someone is harder in the beginning and OP's sister wouldnt have been surprised that he didn't want to be in the wedding if he pulled away earlier", "First of all, \"having feelings\" is not the same as being in love. Especially when you've got a whole Florence Nightingale thing going on. This is an infatuation, not love. It didn't have a chance to grow into love because the two men decided not to pursue it.  \n\n\nSecond, how many marriages make it 30+ years without one or the other \"catching feelings\" for someone else? Mr. Fianc\u00e9 here has just proven what kind of man he is when that kind of thing arrives: back off, create space, and stay true to the woman he's chosen.   \n\n\nHmm. Would I rather marry a fool who thinks he'll never be infatuated with anyone but me for the rest of his days, or would I rather marry a man who's proven he can stay loyal despite the emotional temptation?   \nYeah, I'll take the proven loyal one, actually.  \n\n\nThat said, nobody wants to hear this kind of thing in the lead-up to a wedding, and if she hears about this now, she's likely to make a permanent decision based on temporary outrage (at least, I think that's what most of us would do).", "OP specifically has never \u201ctried to bang his sisters husband\u201d literally he said that they both mutually decided to not be around each other anymore because neither one of them wanted to mess up the relationships that they had. That\u2019s not cheating. That\u2019s the literal opposite of cheating. Admitting you have feelings for someone and deciding to avoid the person you have feelings for is not cheating. Having feelings for another person is not cheating", "Jesus Christ dude, I\u2019m not condoning or actively trying this. \n\nMy point is that he OBVIOUSLY was not trying for this. I really, sincerely, don\u2019t know how you could possibly argue otherwise. \n\nAnd I guess you don\u2019t know either, since you refuse to make any argument and instead want to call me names. \n\nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say the reason you refuse to make any argument is that\u2026 you don\u2019t have one \ud83d\ude2c feel free to prove me wrong.", "The relationship between OP and the dude was never going to be the same as soon as OO realized he was in love. Telling the other person\u2014when pressed\u2014was to explain why OP was breaking off the friendship and to tell the other guy to back off. That doesn\u2019t make OP the AH. However, I think the sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was an AH for admitting he felt something too. He was and is the one in a relationship with someone else. By admitting it, _he_ and not OP was the one who raised the possibility of being together. From OP\u2019s comments, OP would never have taken up the offer because he could never do that to his sister. There is a big difference between confessing to explain why you can\u2019t hang out anymore and confessing to open the door to a relationship.\n\nEdit: autocorrect", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

There is also usually an aspect of hiding it. Not being honest with your partner about what all you do and say with friend. Spending time having conversations, but wanting to keep them secret. Going to your \"friend\" first before you ever would your partner. Thinking your \"friend\" understands you better than your partner. It's also incredibly messy and hard to define because people will fall into sometimes without even noticing or meaning to. \n\nA Relationship is rocky, you start going to your friend to talk about it, bam suddenly you are going to your friend more than you are your partner and giving them more of your time and energy and it's actually hurting your relationship instead of being a source to help you strengthen it. \n\nDo I think these guys likely flirted with if not outright fell into emotional affair terrority? Probably. \n\nBut we don't know. We don't know how much more the guy was giving to OP vs his actual partner or what he was seeking emotionally from OP. He may have genuinely thought they were friends and he had ugly feelings he needed to work through. \n\nSaying that simply they had returned feelings for each other and a close friendship means it's an emotional affair automatically is my problem.\n\nIt was a dumb hill to pick. Especially with this example. So my bad.\n\nHonestly have a good one \n\nI hope these three work it out too", "You literally cut off part of the wikipedia definition to prove your point LOL. Love how you left out \"An emotional affair may emerge from a friendship, and ***progress toward greater levels of personal intimacy and attachment***\"\n\nWhich we don't know that it did.\n\nAnd you also cut out that being too quick to assume that friendships are emotional affairs is a type of coercive control. Very very interesting\n\nIt usually includes giving more to your emotional affair partner than what you give to your actual partner.

It is also possible to have feelings for those close friends. It is also possible to not cross those lines and put more of your energy or emotions to those people at the sake of your actual partner and allow the feelings to pass while remaining committed to the person you are with. \n\nYes, they could have easily had an emotional affair and I am inclined to believe they did. But it is still an overly used phrase on a site that loves to pick up the first sentence of a wikipedia entry and assume they understand complex psychological concepts. \n\nHaving feelings for a friend but not acting on it doesn't make it literally the definition of an emotional affair. \"Moron\"", "Might wanna edit that last word out, i just had a comment removed for less", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeplpi/comment/iz81bzp/\n\nAnd this is important too\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeplpi/comment/iz7tz97/\n\nIt is a lot of drama, but it's better to address now than in 3 or 4 years.

I get it.  Bridgerton and cute romance stories exist.\n\nIf your sibling was playing love games with your fiance you wouldn't be out here going to bat for this.  \n\nOP is telling the story and two things do not pass smell test.  1.  Fucking with your sisters fiance period. 2. Refusing to be in wedding party.\n\nCome on now. Less bridgerton more rationality", "I can understand that stance. \n\nWhat tips it over for me is that OP states in comments that he confessed because he thought it would make himself feel better. Even when saying that he would never act on it, he says it\u2019s because *he* couldn\u2019t live with the guilt and his family would never forgive *him*. Not, \u201cI love my sister and could never hurt her like that.\u201d \n\nAlso, I think it would\u2019ve been way easier to stay distanced and make excuses when pressed about the original issue, than it is to do the same now that he\u2019s being asked to be in the bridal party. Since they each know about each others\u2019 feelings (whether the fianc\u00e9\u2019s are still the same or not), there is now an added layer of tension between them in this wedding situation, which could have been avoided by OP keeping his feelings to himself. \n\nAnyway, you make some good points and I think we can agree that fianc\u00e9 is the real AH, while OP\u2019s position is complicated and subjective. I stand by my opinion, but thanks for the perspective. Good night \ud83c\udf19", "Also, I am not replying anymore but I would urge people to stop assuming they get things because they read a short definition on Wikipedia (a good starting source but not the end) or Reddit. Hell, I don't even fully understand this concept. Because it's messy and hard.

I just think sometimes people should know how they come off in the comments online but I recognize that this sub is a lot more strict than most with name-calling (ironically)", "I can see how you would interpret that comment to mean OP admitted the feelings to \u201cget it off his chest.\u201d But I disagree that it means that was his sole intent. My reading is that he felt compelled to explain why he was no longer friendly, and he thought admitting his feelings would help them make a clean break. I suspect that finding out the guy reciprocated his feelings is the main reason OP didn\u2019t get the catharsis he  was expecting. If anything, I think the sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is the AH for admitting he felt something too.", "I agree that it's more hurtful when it's in-family. I don't agree that this sounds like an emotional affair. I personally believe that it doesn't become an emotional affair until you make a choice to indulge in it. Catching feelings and then backing off would be cutting the temptation off and not allowing it to become an emotional affair. What counts is what people *decide* to do about their incidental infatuation.", "Lol. You don't get to choose who you fall in love with. So OP did nothing wrong and did not pursue any relations with the fiance."]}
