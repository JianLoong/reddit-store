I then, as a joke, said \"at least she'll still be tight down there.\" My GF looked confused and then said that was a weird comment to make about her friend. I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her \"youre so insecure\" and she then goes \"does it make you feel good to call me that?\" so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off. She showed up at our apartment 30min later and was really pissed called me an asshole and over reacted, and that she waited in the cold for 20 min for an uber.

It\u2019s interesting how many people that claim some disgusting statement is a joke can\u2019t say why - I guess they know that it\u2019s really not funny. Sadly it became a trend to say vile shit, when called out say haha it\u2019s a joke can\u2019t you take a joke, and when people give you consequences for the vile statements they whine about \u201ccancel culture\u201d.\n\nThank you to the people that explained it me.

That comment about being tight is misogynistic as hell. She\u2019s concerned about her friend because c sections can be really scary.

Where do I start? The comment is definitely weird to say about anyone. The concept of being \"tight\" as a positive thing is pretty sexist and sexualizing childbirth is strange. Also whether it's a normal joke to make among your friends because you all have normalized sexist jokes does not mean others can't be uncomfortable with the joke. It's such an immature and unnecessary comment to make and then to refuse to back down about.\n\nAnd then instead of asking why she felt that way (if you're so unaware you genuinely don't know), apologizing, or honestly just dropping it after it made your girlfriend (someone whose feelings you're supposed to care about) uncomfortable...you left the restaurant and left your girlfriend stranded. Wtf. That alone too is such an AH move. Leaving your girlfriend stranded and completely disregarding her well-being for what? Because you can't manage your own emotions? Because you can't handle someone disagreeing with you or calling you out on something?

I then, as a joke, said \"at least she'll still be tight down there.\" My GF looked confused and then said that was a weird comment to make about her friend. I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her \"youre so insecure\" and she then goes \"does it make you feel good to call me that?\" so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off. She showed up at our apartment 30min later and was really pissed called me an asshole and over reacted, and that she waited in the cold for 20 min for an uber.
