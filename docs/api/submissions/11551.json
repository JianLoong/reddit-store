The pay was high because the hospital was really short staffed. They are both in nursery full time, 8am-6pm, and my husband agreed to take on the extra childcare needed as the shifts were 12 hours, 8am-8pm. \n\nIt's not abnormal for me to have 12 hour shifts, though usually I work 8 hours. My husband is perfectly capable of looking after our children when I do 12 hour shifts. \n\nMy in-laws live a 5 minute walk away and are both retired. My SIL is also nearby and is a stay at home mum. \n\nDuring my first shift, nursery called me and said my youngest had a fever and had to be picked up. I called my husband and asked him to go because he could work from home, and if I left work, I wouldn't get paid because these are bank shifts. I would also likely be \"black listed\" for leaving despite the circumstances. My husband agreed to sort out childcare or pick our daughter up. He said he would also look after her over the next two days so I could work all the extra shifts. \n\nHe then called his mum to see if she could pick up our daughter and he would come home. His work is a 45-minute drive, and MIL was a 5 minute walk from the nursery. MIL told him to stay at work and not to worry, she'd look after her. \n\nHe got home around 6 pm, they put the girls to bed together, and MIL said she wanted to stay over and look after her the next couple of days too. My husband agreed. \n\nAfter my third shift, MIL got angry at me for working and said that when my child was sick, I should've cancelled the extra shifts. Said I was selfish and money grabbing. She went home and won't answer mine or my husbands calls. SIL also sent a message to me how she would NEVER let someone else look after her children if they were sick, and how could i be so selfish? \n\nMy daughter had a mild fever and a cold. She wasn't seriously unwell.

I would be on that phone asking her why she didn't trust my husband. And when she got confused, told her it was obvious she didn't trust him with his own children and demand to know why.\n\nNow. I know this might be the uncommon response, as the right thing to do is assume your husband loves his kids.

Are your in laws aware of the economy??? Joking aside\u2026 she offered for your husband to stay at work and said SHE would look after the kids\u2026. Then got mad after she offered the help?? That makes no sense. Your husband also was okay with you working and him taking care of the kids, she didn\u2019t have to do anything but made the choice to. So where does she get off thinking it\u2019s acceptable to hold it against you for something she chose to do? Her choices were not your fault for working extra shifts.

If we came home sick during the day, dad would stay with us. Mom had the better paying job, so she did not stay home with us. Dad had more generous leave, he stayed home with us.

My guess is if you were broke from not taking more shifts she would have a problem with that too.", "NTA. I hope your husband is going to back you up on this and talk to his mom and sister. You didn't ask MIL to watch your daughter, she fucking volunteered it!

Yes, you have MIL and SIL nearby... but notice how in this story *all the expectation on childminding is placed on the women*? MIL is angry at you for not watching your children when you are working 12 hour shifts. Your husband, who should be watching his children, immediately dumps the responsibility off on his mother. You state, oh, he has MIL and SIL who can do it. Why should they? These aren't their kids. These are your husband's kids.

But I would still take this opportunity with your husband to reflect. It is possible that you and your husband have (perhaps without meaning to) placed too much of a childcare burden on your MIL and SIL over time and that for reasons that may be between mother and son (guilt, sense of loyalty, whatever) MIL may feel like she has to say yes on the one hand when your husband calls her up and asks for this \"favor\" but then becomes overtaxed when it's three days later and she's minding sick kids. And so she lashes out at you, another woman, for not having minded your kids in the first place. (I am NOT saying it was your job to mind the kids. You and your hubby had an agreement. It was his job. But I do think he may be unconsciously putting pressure on his mother and she is showing her resentment for it by lashing out at you--who she clearly does not care for as much as her son.) \n\nGoing forward, it would probably be better if you or your husband picked up the kids when they are sick, rather than calling on MIL and SIL to do it.

Where I think the husband may be falling into a pattern of taking advantage of MIL/SIL is that he didn't immediately pick up his child and switch over to parenting and caring for his sick child himself. He just turned over that duty to his mom (or, according to his wife, he lets his sister do it, because she's a SAHM.) Yes, MIL volunteered. That's on her. But I also question if she feels overburdened or guilt tripped or if there is some dynamic at play where she feels like she cannot say no and then because she can't say no, this comes out as her lashing out at the OP days later for \"not minding her own children.\" \n\nNow of course she should really be chewing out her own son because they're his children, and it was his days to watch them, and she did consent to watch them.

She also does it for free and refuses payment. This is really out of character.

I think i missed where SIL ever watched the kids.\n\nI see what you're saying on just double checking that the MIL doesn't feel guilty into watching their kid more often but in this situation I don't think the husband specifically did any wrong. I think that's where we lose each other.\n\nHe asked a relative 5 minutes away from his child, to pick up his kid while he was driving home to take care of her (so the sick child is not sitting at school for 45 minutes waiting to be picked up)\n\nHe can't teleport so he would not be able to instantly pick the child up. He was literally leaving work to get her and called MIL to see if she could pick the child up from school a bit earlier than him and he would then take over. MIL agreed. This is a completely reasonable scenario and nothing that I'm reading indicates that OP and her husband are taking advantage of or dumping their responsibilities on the MIL.\n\nWe aren't mind readers or seers, though, so I guess we don't know that for sure, so it's worth the mention to verify with MIL after this situation blows over", "I'm sorry but if you offer something then you have no reason to complain when people accept your offer to help; MIL was way out of line for offering something she had no intention of 100% following through on. She got mad at you for not calling out of work when she insisted on staying at your home to look after your unwell daughter? MIL needs to check herself; last time I checked, your daughter has 2 capable parents & 1 of which agreed to look after your unwell child while the other work. Her assumption that caring for unwell children should fall on the mother is out dated & not what you & your husband agreed for this situation. Next time, don't take her up on her offer & follow through with what was agreed upon between you & your husband.", "Nvm. Saw OP's responses to you. Definitely don't think they are overburdening MIL. \n\nIf guilt is in play it may be MIL guilting herself into watching OP's kids under the misguided thought that men should be the breadwinners and women should be the child care givers.", "NTA. Unless someone has worked as a nurse, they will not understand. The healthcare environment is a toxic workplace.  You can\u2019t call in too much and you could lose your license if they decide to go after you for patient abandonment if you need to leave work early. Also, I\u2019m sure you would have come home early if she was very ill. However, our version of sick and the lay person\u2019s idea of sick is two different things. That might be the issue with MIL. Also some women believe that the childcare is women\u2019s work.", "NTA. This is not a level of emergency that needed on the spot throwing everything aside immediately.", "NTA your in laws interfering was unnecessary and sexist.", "NTA - why offer if you disagree with it? What an odd thing to do? Also why is it money grabbing for you to work, but not hubby?", "MIL needed a nap.\n\nSIL needs some healthy reasonable expectations, and boundaries to boot.\n\nNTA, OP", "Nta. She volunteered, husband was perfectly capable of taking care of them.", "I'm not familiar with the field although one of my close cousins is a nurse."]}
