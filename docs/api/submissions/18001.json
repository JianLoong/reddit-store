Based on what you\u2019ve written here, you are in for a world of challenges and disrespect for the role you\u2019re taking on. \nI appreciate you\u2019re willingness but you must require this be worked out PRIOR to you moving in. Also, if you proceed with this plan, get it all in writing. These children are not your responsibility and if your bf doesn\u2019t acknowledge your contribution and the value it has, it\u2019s going to be much worse once the entanglement increases by moving in. Stand firm and best of luck!", "Entitled and ungrateful. These a huge red flags you should really reconsider before moving in.\n\nYou're the one who he dumps both of the kids on and he takes credit for \"taking care\" of them?", "NTA, but this is definitely something that needs to be discussed further between you two. Make sure you're on the same page before anything happens, otherwise this could result in a living hell for the both of you.", "NTA. Don't move in.  \n\nWho is watching the kids now?  How much money is he paying to have the girls watched now?   He is already acting shady and you haven't even moved in yet.  Please don't do this to yourself.", "NTA - looks like he is thinking of you as a parent helper before you have taken that step in your relationship.  \n\nIE sounds like he wouldn't mind having a mom join in the household.  \n\nN  T A for the financial questions- how much am I going to pay in rent and share household expenses while expecting to also babysit and nanny? Because you ARE acting as a nanny/babysitter as the kids are not yours and you are not married (or an equvalent). Yeah, moving in with him does mean you have to have some responsibility for minors in the home. Treating them well, getting along, putting aside your own needs for theirs... etc   \n\nBut will you also be doing their laundry, cleaning, cooking, taking them everywhere? Those sound like parent/wife tasks.   \n\nHence why so many people will be like WAIT don't move in yet!    \n\nFinances are also a HUGE deal when it comes to shared households. The money you make now is yours. When moving in there is some of your money that is now ours (rent, utilities, etc) that is beyond a roomate.  \n\nBut now you are being asked to go beyond that. Spend your own time and money to help his kid and some other kid. That's fine and super cool of you to do. But what about if you decide to take a vacation? Or what happens if a kid is sick and you are WFH? What are the expectations overall?  \n\nSeems like a little red flag popped up in your relationship and its either an misunderstanding that you communicate out of... or a big old RED FLAG", "NTA and that isn\u2019t something that just expected of a wife. SAHM is a job, being a parent in general is a full time job. The whole point in having one parent stay home is to help save money. Child care is expensive. So even staying home to watch the kids for a day is a valid point, you\u2019ll be saving the household money.", "NTA. Your bf seems a little dramatic. Do you have close friends or family you could drop them off at on the days that you are at work?", "NTA. How long have you been dating? There's nothing wrong with wanting acknowledgment on this.  Childcare is PRICEY, and not all gf's would do what you're doing.  I actually saw a post a few weeks ago from a woman who'd been with her gut SEVEN years and never integrated him with her kids.", "It's hard to tell what kind of credit you are expecting. A direct dollar valuation? A measure in the splitting of household tasks? Something else or both? It sounds like you really need a far ranging discussion about the sharing of all kinds of responsibilities.", "NTA and it\u2019s most definitely something that should be addressed before moving in. Your not asking for an actual dollar amount evaluation here on it, just for him to take it into consideration. And you are only his gf not his wife and your not any kind of SAHP, you\u2019re working. How the two of your coordinate these day and the value of it is going to be a test here i believe. He clearly AH\u2019s higher expectations from your than you\u2019re aware of and you haven\u2019t even moved in yet. A bit of a red flag! \n\nI would be more comfortable with a lease agreement or some type to to protect you from just being thrown out of the house if it ever came down to it and to have the arrangements/agreements in writing so it can be argued about down the road. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA - suddenly - he doesn't sound like such a prince!  Yes, your watching of HIS children will be an economic boon to him.  It should be acknowledged as part of your contribution to the household, even if you were married!", ">since I am moving in with him it should be expected that I would help out in this way\n\nHave a serious discussion about what else he expects so that the two of you are on the same page *before* you move in. Also, working from home doesn't mean you're available to babysit, do housework and run errands.", "Will do! Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nWorking from home is working from home. You will not have the time to interact with the kids in any meaningful way. \n\nThey won\u2019t have field trips or socializing with friends or any of the stuff that makes summer fun. They\u2019ll likely be bored or just watch screens all summer. \n\nIf you do take time to interact with them you\u2019ll either have yo use your break and mealtimes to do that (leaving you with no actual mental breaks) or you\u2019ll use up work time and have to make that time up later, assuming your job even has that flexibility. \n\nNone of this is good for you or them. \n\nI\u2019d rethink the entire situation. And your boyfriend is acting very entitled and AH. Huge red flags.", "INFO: \n\nHow much money are you actually contributing to the household? \n\nWho earns more - you or your boyfriend?", "NAH, but I kind of see his side a bit better.

She didn't want to pay less, she just wanted reconision. \n\n\nI honestly can't really see his side. SAHP or even the parent who works part time are reconised for significantly contributing by saving on childcare. Why is it so bad she wants the same thing?", "I have recently found myself in a situation where my boyfriend and his son stay with me every second weekend and every Monday night. It is exhausting. It is thankless. You are sacrificing much more than time and money. This will be what makes or breaks your relationship. I am hoping things work out in my world but there has been issues that I didn't forsee and at times I feel I am being punished. No good deed and all that. \n\nAlways make sure that your you remain your priority.", "Good luck! It's probably just a communication and expectations thing - ie it is not about the money its about the time, expectations, boundaries, etc.", "Is he usually pretty good at thanking you and giving you credit for things you help with?", "Definitely you should not be paying half. Even if you didn\u2019t watch the girls. I would let him know that it\u2019s fine if he would rather bring them to camp than have you watch them. Let him get sticker shock when he sees the price of that. Also.. if you were married, it\u2019s still not your job to watch them while you\u2019re working. It\u2019s concerning that he seems to want you as a maid and nanny rather than treating you well for the work that you contribute. You owe him nothing so he should appreciate all that you do and I would suggest doing exactly nothing until he gets his head out of his ass", "Hope you two figure it out!", "Ok yep - so absolutely NTA. \n\nThis sounds more than fair to me, especially as (I'm guessing?) you won't be put on the title to the house or anything, which makes sense. \n\nI'm more than a little troubled by the fact that your boyfriend doesn't seem to recognize non-monetary duties/chores/tasks around the home as being meaningful in a conversation about household contributions. Especially if you guys are ever thinking about having children of your own, that's a potential red flag for me. \n\nHopefully this is just a one-time error in judgment for him, though, and he doesn't normally think this way.", "You should ask to see what he pays for the mortgage but usually food and utilities costs more than that. And also that puts an unfair amount of the burden of feeding the kids on you. Personally, I would expect something like half of the food and utilities (since you probably take up 1/4 to 1/3rd - that extra contribution equals out with the house costs) \n\nLook very carefully at this relationship because it\u2019s a huge red flag that he wants to take advantage of your labor and your money. It won\u2019t get better from here!", "When did I say she was evil?", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Sometimes", "Thank you very much for your insight\u2026. He wanted me to contribute to his mortgage too and he is having trouble understanding my view that I should not contribute to his mortgage if I am not on his title or deed so I am simply trying to explain to him these are ways I am contributing without paying his mortgage ( utilities, food, watching kids, organizing home etc*)", "Great points! Thank you!", "Wrong/evil/whatever - I don't want to argue semantics. If we would argue semantics, I would tell you that I never said you called her evil. \n\n\nCan you explain his side to me?", "I mean, there is an argument here that you guys should draw up a lease and have you as an official tenant - so you can pay X amount of rent that goes towards his mortgage or whatever else. \n\nBut the more you're telling me about this guy, the more I'm finding it troubling. Do you actually have a good relationship? Because it sort of seems like he just wants to move you in for the money and the childcare. I'm hoping that's not true, for your sake.", "Paying for all of the food and utilities is likely more than the mortgage. She should be paying overall about a quarter to a third of the total costs of running the household. Please take the time to look at what you spend each month and what the mortgage costs and calculate out what is fair. This does not sound fair.", "I\u2019m not arguing semantics.

Have the day you deserve", ">like I shouldn\u2019t even bring that up because since I am moving in with him it should be expected that I would help out in this way.\n\nDon't move in.

What other labor is he going to discount bc you're doing it instead of paying someone else to do it?", "NTA but seriously consider whether you want to move in with someone who doesn't value your contribution. \n\nHave hom arrange childcare so you can work as scheduled and have days off as scheduled", "NTA simple solution is he finds a babysitter or daycare - I would be leery of someone saying it was expected that I would be responsible for watching his kids and then acting like it's scamming.
