I went through a lot, but I can understand your frustration over lack of privacy, unlike others in this thread.. \n\nHaving a space to sleep doesn\u2019t always equal privacy- I\u2019ve had my own room with no door and have had multiple people walk in on me changing on multiple occasions bc they didn\u2019t bother to knock. You said you\u2019re not allowed to put a curtain up so I can imagine the invasion of privacy you feel  because of the glass door. You\u2019re NTA and if you\u2019re parents got the apartment with the intention of raising a child there they should have gotten a place where they had the SPACE to do so especially if they had the ability to.

I HAD TO LIVE IN A BOX WITH MY 20 SIBLINGS\" is fucking annoying. just because YOU had it worse, doesnt mean people cant still be upset about a less-than-desirable situation. good lord", "NTA a dining room is not a bedroom and since it was  an apartment I'm guessing it was basically a box, they literally chose a nice view over their child. I would be resentful too, I slept on a couch most of my childhood.", "NTA all the comments saying about how they had it worse growing up don\u2019t make your situation not crappy.  \n\nIf your parents could have reasonably afforded a place that had a bedroom for you and still prioritized having a good view then they were being selfish.", "NTA. My parents built the house and changed the position of the doorframe to face the stairs directly and then wouldn\u2019t allow me to have a door. They wanted to be able to see in my room. It sucked for a lot of reasons but basically anytime anyone turned lights on or went to the bathroom it woke me up.

I\u2019d also be upset if I had to spend my teen years with glass doors showing my every move to anyone in the kitchen.

Parents can totally prioritize there children and still live in unf circumstances.

If they wanted to stay there it seems like they could have at least changed the door out, put up a curtain over it or something.\n\nI grew up poor and lived in a 1 bedroom apartment with my parents and 2 siblings. I shared a room off the kitchen with my sister and we did not have a door for awhile. I understand how hard it is wanting some privacy and your room being next to a place where people would be making noise. We eventually got a nice solid door installed. My parents did not have a choice. Yours did.", "NTA 1. A kid deserves some measure of privacy especially when they could afford it. 2.

It would be one thing if that was all they could afford, but in your case they could have afforded to provide a bedroom for you but chose not to. They also could have provided an opaque door that closed.", "NTA\nI would be irritated if I were in your shoes, also. I agree that if they couldn\u2019t afford anything else, I\u2019d cut them some slack. But to have a 1-yr old toddler and choose a 1-bedroom apartment with a view over a 2-bedroom apartment without a view makes them self-centered parents and you are entitled to your feelings about that.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d be resentful too. It shows a clear lack of decision making in regards to you and what you needed as a kid.

Is it AH-ish for resenting them for not giving you your \"own\" bedroom? Well, yeah. They provided you with what you needed, and it's AH-ish to hold a grudge that you didn't get everything you would have wanted. Parenting is a hard job: there's no manual and, even if there were, every kid is different. There is no realistic way for parents to know what each kid would pick as their priorities on every issue... And even if there were a way to know that, parents are people too, and their preferences matter just as much as their kids' preferences. So, while it is perfectly acceptable to have different priorities than your parents did and wish that they had chosen to live by your priorities instead, being resentful is AH-ish \n\nOn the other hand, they *did* value a view over your privacy. That's not unreasonable of them, and there may have been a number of other benefits of living in that particular building that you weren't aware of (and that you would have missed out on if you were living in your hypothetical bigger but cheaper apartment). Calling you ungrateful for pointing out where their priorities lay was unfair of them. \n\nAnd anyone who says that you \"shouldn\u2019t complain since other people had it much worse\" is inherently being an AH. It's not a contest where only the person who had it worst gets to complain, we are all allowed to have things that disappointed us, no matter how fortunate we are in other areas\n\nESH", "ESH only because there is not enough info.

They\u2019re awesome and always put their kids first.", "it is ABSOLUTELY valid for you to be upset about your situations and even to view ops situation as preferential. that is very understandable, im sorry you had to face so much so young. \n\nhowever, it is really important to have empathy, even for those who you might perceive as struggling less than you did. theres no reason that because you struggled, someone else with different problems didnt struggle as much. theres not a limited amount of trauma in the world. i know its hard though, im not perfect. i see people post about their anxiety and my brain goes \"well at least THEY dont have to have bpd\", but i work every day trying to correct that mindset, because my personal struggles do not stop others from having problems at well.\n\nits really commendable that you were able to acknowledge your anger towards your parents affected your view on ops situation, but that ops situation was still something really unpleasant. you dont need to compare yourself or attempt to dimish your own traum by saying \"well maybe i shouldnt be As upset because my parents had external factors that contributed to my circumstances\". your struggles with more \"uncontrollable\" circumstances like mental health and poverty are just as valid as ops parents just being selfish. both problems can exist independently, and empathizing with op doesnt mean you cant still be upset about your own life.\n\ni hope youre doing better now, i cant even imagine how rough that must have been. thank you for being open to a different opinion, i hope you have a good day", "Weren't they ashamed when people visited? Like that's how you treat your child? It's very weird. They didn't give you everything. Delusional. NTA", "NTA. Briefly my youngest daughter and I had to live in a Bounder RV. She was 16. I gave her the bedroom and slept on the couch. \n\nNever would I ever choose a view over the comfort and safety of my child.", "I'm halfway to becoming a psychologist and in school right now we're learning about what causes long-lasting damage in kids. Of course physical abuse does, but emotional neglect can leave you just as broken. Not getting affection, validation, empathy, not getting to internalize a positive inner voice of a parent, not having anyone to turn to when you need it. To be alone, uncared for. \n\nThe amount of pain that this can cause is staggering because it doesn't just stop when you grow up, it's part of your brain now and you have to unlearn it and that is very, very hard.", "I'm in your camp...Just 2 of us, my daughter is 7 and her room is large enough but as she grows up, I know she'll want more of her own space so I'm looking to buy a bigger place with an additional bedroom that she can use as a play area/study/TV room. \n\nI put my kiddo first as much as possible because I view it as my job. I don't need thanks or gratitude from her for it - its my duty as a parent. I made the choice to take on the responsibility. \n\nI know people who feel \"I sacrifice enough for my kid - they can deal with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" but I don't aspire to be one of those people.", "I would\u2019ve said you ATA but upon reading everything, which is what we\u2019re supposed to do on here, you are NTA. My parents bought a house about 5 or 6 so years ago after moving out of the house we had rented, and throughout my entire childhood I never had my own room because I shared it with my siblings. I understand they didn\u2019t have resources that a lot of other kids did, so despite my situation i was grateful for what I had. I, now 16, still share a room with my little brother, and that\u2019s more a necessity because buying a house is expensive and a hassle altogether. if your situation was the same as mine, you\u2019d have been the A-hole.", "ESH. Sure, they absolutely *should* have gotten a place where you could've had your own bedroom, since you said they were definitely in a position to do so. But also, some of us were raised by horribly abusive/neglectful assholes, and the trauma from that couldn't have been prevented by hanging a sheet. So maybe you're being a little ungrateful, too.\n\nEdit: after reading some other POVs, I'm changing my answer. Although your childhood situation would've been a huge upgrade from mine, that doesn't make it less shitty that your parents treated you like an afterthought. I'm sorry you went through that.

That really is all there is to it.", "If you are going to Northern CA, have you looked at USDA rural home loans? There are many areas up there that will qualify! You don\u2019t need a down payment with those really. Technically it\u2019s .5% but you can use down payment assistance programs to cover that. You don\u2019t need an amazing credit score either. If you are below a certain income, they will give you a 38 year loan with subsidized interest to make it more affordable. \n\nThese sorts of loans are meant to make housing affordable, often more so than renting.", "op wasn't allowed to", "OP wasn't allowed to do that.", "They are my parents and the good outweighs the bad. I don\u2019t think they did anything maliciously. I think it\u2019s just natural to love your parents. Of course that doesn\u2019t apply to everyone", "Yeah I can relate to that. I'm 27 now so I'm finally able to access financial aid programs, but until I was 25 it was assumed my parents would pay for me because of their networth.

Out of all they did for you as you were growing up, and out of all they provided for you as you were growing up, this is all you have to resent? I would say you were doing pretty well. When I was growing up, I had to share a room with my brother, 4 years my junior, and people had to go through our bedroom to get to another. I did not have a room of my own until the summer after my junior year in high school. It is not a big deal.", "so annoying the responses. all of them saying that they lived in a 3x3 room with 3 dogs, their aut, uncle, cousins and their siblings. OP is not saying that he's bothered about the room that he has but was upset because their parents choose a stupid view over them privacy. on the other hand, for those who say that it was in fact a room, it wasn't. Having a real room implies privacy, and if their parents had the posibility of looking inside even with the door closed, that's not privacy at all. What if OP wanted to change clothes and there were visits and they passed by their room, or them wanted to yk play with themself :p he had no real privacy.", "NTA and god that \"others have it worse\" is some of the most obvious toxicity in the world.  If you lose a leg, someone telling you \"well you could be a quadriplegic\" is Not helpful, is not a solid argument for why losing the leg is fine, or in anyway an appropriate response.  Frankly considering the values they have displayed remember this any time they ask for any form of \"help\" and that the golden rule goes both ways.", "Wow. I mean, I don\u2019t lack work ethic (like you, first chores, then job as soon as I was allowed by law at age 15), but I\u2019m lazy and could probably do a little better for myself.

It's hard not to outright resent and hate them but it is what it is", "Same. I passed on so many houses in my price range that had tiny little 8x8 second/third bedrooms with luxurious master suites because I wanted my child to have a decent personal space more than I wanted a granite kitchen, a nice view, or whatever.
