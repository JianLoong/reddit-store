I went through a lot, but I can understand your frustration over lack of privacy, unlike others in this thread.. \n\nHaving a space to sleep doesn\u2019t always equal privacy- I\u2019ve had my own room with no door and have had multiple people walk in on me changing on multiple occasions bc they didn\u2019t bother to knock. You said you\u2019re not allowed to put a curtain up so I can imagine the invasion of privacy you feel  because of the glass door. You\u2019re NTA and if you\u2019re parents got the apartment with the intention of raising a child there they should have gotten a place where they had the SPACE to do so especially if they had the ability to. It does suck but it\u2019s unfortunately something you\u2019re going to have to stick out unless you guys plan on moving soon, just try not to let this sour your relationship with your parents.", "NTA\n\njesus christ these comments. my mom hit me when i was a kid. she was abusive in many ways. did she beat me black and blue? no. did she kick me out? no. was she still abusive? yes\n\nthings are not black and white. just because they had a roof over their heads doesnt mean they cant be upset that their room was essentially a fish tank that their parents could look into whenever they please, since OP said they werent able to put up curtains. everyone saying \"YOURE UNGRATEFUL! I HAD TO LIVE IN A BOX WITH MY 20 SIBLINGS\" is fucking annoying. just because YOU had it worse, doesnt mean people cant still be upset about a less-than-desirable situation. good lord", "NTA a dining room is not a bedroom and since it was  an apartment I'm guessing it was basically a box, they literally chose a nice view over their child. I would be resentful too, I slept on a couch most of my childhood.", "NTA all the comments saying about how they had it worse growing up don\u2019t make your situation not crappy.  \n\nIf your parents could have reasonably afforded a place that had a bedroom for you and still prioritized having a good view then they were being selfish.", "NTA. My parents built the house and changed the position of the doorframe to face the stairs directly and then wouldn\u2019t allow me to have a door. They wanted to be able to see in my room. It sucked for a lot of reasons but basically anytime anyone turned lights on or went to the bathroom it woke me up.

I\u2019d also be upset if I had to spend my teen years with glass doors showing my every move to anyone in the kitchen.

It would be one thing if that was all they could afford, but in your case they could have afforded to provide a bedroom for you but chose not to. They also could have provided an opaque door that closed.", "NTA\nI would be irritated if I were in your shoes, also. I agree that if they couldn\u2019t afford anything else, I\u2019d cut them some slack. But to have a 1-yr old toddler and choose a 1-bedroom apartment with a view over a 2-bedroom apartment without a view makes them self-centered parents and you are entitled to your feelings about that.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d be resentful too. It shows a clear lack of decision making in regards to you and what you needed as a kid.

Is it AH-ish for resenting them for not giving you your \"own\" bedroom? Well, yeah. They provided you with what you needed, and it's AH-ish to hold a grudge that you didn't get everything you would have wanted. Parenting is a hard job: there's no manual and, even if there were, every kid is different. There is no realistic way for parents to know what each kid would pick as their priorities on every issue... And even if there were a way to know that, parents are people too, and their preferences matter just as much as their kids' preferences. So, while it is perfectly acceptable to have different priorities than your parents did and wish that they had chosen to live by your priorities instead, being resentful is AH-ish \n\nOn the other hand, they *did* value a view over your privacy. That's not unreasonable of them, and there may have been a number of other benefits of living in that particular building that you weren't aware of (and that you would have missed out on if you were living in your hypothetical bigger but cheaper apartment). Calling you ungrateful for pointing out where their priorities lay was unfair of them. \n\nAnd anyone who says that you \"shouldn\u2019t complain since other people had it much worse\" is inherently being an AH.

They could've easily bought a cheaper one that came with two bedrooms. They chose not to, because they wanted a good view. Op wasn't allowed to even put curtains on the glass around the room and the door couldn't close. You had at least a bit of privacy living with your brother. Op did not. They spent 16 years living like that, from 1 to 17.", "Their parents.", "OP said yes to the curtains. Couldn't have any. Couldn't even close the door because the door wasn't closing.", "OP spent 16 years in that dinning room, from 1 to 17.", "They chose to buy an apartment in the most expensive building of the neighbourhood. They could've bought on in a slightly cheaper building and have two bedrooms. They did not. They wanted the view.\n\nOP could've even put curtains or have a door closed to have some privacy. They were literally without any privacy for 16 years because their parents wanted a good view.", "When people say \u201cit could be a lot worse\u201d I think I\u2019d the Calvin Ana Hobbs comic \u201cIt could be a whole lot better too!\u201d NTA a bedroom is considered a basic requirement for a child.", "I knew someone whose bedroom was a tiny storage closet. He never had a bed, just trash bags with clothes to sleep on while his sisters had rooms.\n\nThe moment he turned 18 his parents made him start paying rent...for a closet and no bed.  And he worshipped  the ground they walked on. He was so neglected it was sick.", "This is the big thing people are overlooking. Sometimes things like this are out of our control and it doesn't make someone an a-hole anytime this situation happens. The reason OP's parents are the a-holes is because they actively chose to put their child in that situation for their own selfish reasons.", "A shoebox?! Sounds like heaven! 700 of us with just one sheet of newspaper as a roof.", "NTA. OP, your parents messed up.\n\nDenying you privacy was a big mistake. You needed space to grow, and they didn't give you that. Even in that same condo, they could have made adjustments to give you what you needed. (For example, they may have chosen the condo with the view because they thought it was a better financial investment, but put up room dividers and soundproofing.)\n\nBut in my view, the bigger failure is that they can't even acknowledge your hurt and own their mistakes \n\nI'm a mom, and the second most important thing I say to my child (after \"I love you\") is \"Mommy made a mistake.\"\n\nIt's important for kids to see that everyone makes mistakes, but we communicate, we hold ourselves accountable, we learn and grow.\n\nParents make mistakes, constantly. \n\nYou just want your parents to acknowledge they made a mistake, see you, and care. Instead they're stonewalling you. \n\nI suspect that's the root of the hurt. \n\nIt's not the view, it's the invalidation.", "I'm sorry this happened and that they are now denying their lack of responsibility for making you live in a glass room (esp. without curtains!) for 16 years. Just adds insult to injury.\n\nWhen you went to college what happened to your \"room\"? Did they convert it to a dining room or leave your furniture, belongings etc. there for a couple years? (I have a feeling I know the answer). What would have happened if you wanted to move back in after college?\n\nIf you want to unpack this (and you haven't already) it might really help to talk to someone about this because in addition to this they likely did other things that made you feel less than and that continue to cause you pain even as an adult.\n\nNTA", "I didn\u2019t have a door until I moved out. Our relationship was strained for awhile, but I\u2019m trying to repair it and my parents have apologized for some of the parenting.", "We've chosen to be single income because having a stay at home parent is a bigger advantage than more money right now. Our house is owned outright as are our vehicles. We are 100% debt free with a very low cost of living. So by income level, yes, we are below the poverty threshold, but we are far from struggling. Having a third bedroom would be nice and all, but not having it isn't the end of the world.", "Why not", "I\u2019m confused at why you made this post. In other comments you say that you have a good relationship with your parents, and that no one is mad at no one. This particular reply and the post as a whole show differently.", "Yeah I thought it was gonna be that they shared with a sibling and their parents could only afford a two bedroom place or something. Not this!", "Definitely indicative of their values, especially as they not only valued the view over their child's wellbeing and right to privacy, but they also valued their space over the child's. If they really loved the apartment that much that they had to have it, they should have given the child the bedroom and the parents slept in the dining room themselves. Why would a parent expect a child to sleep somewhere that is not deemed good or private enough for them?", "Man that\u2019s terrible, I may not have a big house right now, but I\u2019ve regularly saved funds on a monthly basis for all three of my kids in an education savings plan\u2026", "Yes! If they were trying to adopt a child, they would have to provide a bedroom for the child to be approved. That doesn't mean the child has to have a bedroom to himself, but there has to be a bedroom for him to sleep in.", "If you don't have much money to spend on housing, it's absolutely normal and fine for children not to have their own room. However, if you live in a country where the cultural norm is for all children to have their own room, and you can easily afford that, not providing a bedroom for your child is a clear indication that you don't prioritise them. (Speaking as someone who wasn't allowed even a bed until I was 16, people resent that sort of thing.)", "We don\u2019t know what country OP\u2019s in.", "His dad passed away. When we met, his relationship with his mom was strained. It's better now but it took me awhile to understand the dynamics. It's like an unspoken rule to not talk about any of it.", "I feel you. I really do. I was at my dads house. Well really my stepmoms house. But being there was better than being with mom and stepdad.  Hope everything is better  for you now.", "I think nowadays OP is hurt is that the parents won't even acknowledge their mistake. OP's thoughts and feelings just keep getting shut down. It's a lifelong pattern.", "Also, I'm not sure where you get the idea my kids are not provided for... the two oldest literally have thousands saved up between them because there's nothing they want that they don't already have. Both are headed into this next Christmas/birthday season with all their monetary gifts from last year still untouched.. (I can't say the same about my third because they have so many wants they're  constantly spending ahead....) We are able to buy them everything they ask for and do unless we object(I'm not getting my 12 year old a phone...)", "Oh sod off with the privilege bashing bollocks. You have the privilege of being able to access the internet and post on Reddit. I don\u2019t see you currently acknowledging that and self flagellating in order to show repentance", "why do I have a feeling youre umc, or at least in the standard middle class.", "And it had a glass sliding door like a damned fishbowl. I hope they at least allowed her to put a curtain across it. OP def NTA", "I had neighbors who had a huge house and their fairly new BMWs always sat in the driveway (they had a garage). Went in their house one time and the only furniture they had on the ground floor were a couple of bar stools. Just two, but there were four people in the house. Their daughter told me apologetically that her parents spent everything on the house and to lease the cars. I asked her about her car, and she said she worked summers starting at 14 to buy it herself and pay the insurance, but it was kept in her grandmother\u2019s name so her parents couldn\u2019t sell it.\n\nPeople can do absolutely ridiculous things for appearances and selfish reasons that can cause their kids to suffer. I feel for OP. A bedroom for their child was absolutely more important than a view. Wonder if they are going to think about how much that view was worth when OP and family want nothing to do with them.", "I also hate hot tubs, which people find odd. But it's because my parents got one, but I had to clean it. The amount of skin residue in the filter really put me off them.", "That\u2019s awful! Knowing that the money had been tucked away, and then to have it disappear like that! That\u2019s much worse than my Nparents, who didn\u2019t want me to go to uni at all, and kicked in maybe 10% of the cost. I provided the rest somehow, but because they were pretty well off, I didn\u2019t receive as much financial aid as some of my friends from poorer families.\n\nThe aid office said my Nparents \u201cshould have\u201d kicked in more cash. Well, they didn\u2019t. They also went NC before our children were born. I took a privately enormous amount of pleasure when flying monkeys told me how angry they were when my generous in-laws set up college trusts literally at birth!", "Now that's some hilarious whataboutery. There is a clear trend to the posts getting downvoted and OP himself mentions his upper middle class privilege.", "The very least! NTA.", "Just FYI, I live in the UK, and uh... we don't really have closets here. I'm not sure I've ever seen one. I probably have, but I don't remember ever seeing one. And this is definitely not because I've only seen poor houses.\n\nI think literally having _a see through wall_ into a communal area so that you have NO PRIVACY is a much bigger deal than storing your clothes in a wardrobe and a dresser, like I have in every single house since birth."]}
