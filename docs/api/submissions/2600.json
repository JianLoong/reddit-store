I went through a lot, but I can understand your frustration over lack of privacy, unlike others in this thread.. \n\nHaving a space to sleep doesn\u2019t always equal privacy- I\u2019ve had my own room with no door and have had multiple people walk in on me changing on multiple occasions bc they didn\u2019t bother to knock. You said you\u2019re not allowed to put a curtain up so I can imagine the invasion of privacy you feel  because of the glass door. You\u2019re NTA and if you\u2019re parents got the apartment with the intention of raising a child there they should have gotten a place where they had the SPACE to do so especially if they had the ability to. It does suck but it\u2019s unfortunately something you\u2019re going to have to stick out unless you guys plan on moving soon, just try not to let this sour your relationship with your parents.", "NTA\n\njesus christ these comments. my mom hit me when i was a kid. she was abusive in many ways. did she beat me black and blue? no. did she kick me out? no. was she still abusive? yes\n\nthings are not black and white. just because they had a roof over their heads doesnt mean they cant be upset that their room was essentially a fish tank that their parents could look into whenever they please, since OP said they werent able to put up curtains. everyone saying \"YOURE UNGRATEFUL! I HAD TO LIVE IN A BOX WITH MY 20 SIBLINGS\" is fucking annoying. just because YOU had it worse, doesnt mean people cant still be upset about a less-than-desirable situation. good lord", "NTA a dining room is not a bedroom and since it was  an apartment I'm guessing it was basically a box, they literally chose a nice view over their child. I would be resentful too, I slept on a couch most of my childhood.", "NTA all the comments saying about how they had it worse growing up don\u2019t make your situation not crappy.  \n\nIf your parents could have reasonably afforded a place that had a bedroom for you and still prioritized having a good view then they were being selfish.", "NTA. My parents built the house and changed the position of the doorframe to face the stairs directly and then wouldn\u2019t allow me to have a door. They wanted to be able to see in my room. It sucked for a lot of reasons but basically anytime anyone turned lights on or went to the bathroom it woke me up.

I\u2019d also be upset if I had to spend my teen years with glass doors showing my every move to anyone in the kitchen. Voicing how this made you feel doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, I can\u2019t believe all the Y T A votes simply because you didn\u2019t have it as bad as others.

They may have given you a lot but did not give you a real bedroom when they could have. If they wanted to stay there it seems like they could have at least changed the door out, put up a curtain over it or something.\n\nI grew up poor and lived in a 1 bedroom apartment with my parents and 2 siblings. I shared a room off the kitchen with my sister and we did not have a door for awhile.

It would be one thing if that was all they could afford, but in your case they could have afforded to provide a bedroom for you but chose not to. They also could have provided an opaque door that closed.", "NTA\nI would be irritated if I were in your shoes, also. I agree that if they couldn\u2019t afford anything else, I\u2019d cut them some slack. But to have a 1-yr old toddler and choose a 1-bedroom apartment with a view over a 2-bedroom apartment without a view makes them self-centered parents and you are entitled to your feelings about that.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d be resentful too. It shows a clear lack of decision making in regards to you and what you needed as a kid. If they loved it so much they could have it rented out and put themselves in a more suitable home until you moved out.", "I\u2019d suggest therapy if this is still bothering you.", "[deleted]", "How old are you?", "Ooh boy. Is it AH-ish for resenting them for not giving you your \"own\" bedroom? Well, yeah. They provided you with what you needed, and it's AH-ish to hold a grudge that you didn't get everything you would have wanted. Parenting is a hard job: there's no manual and, even if there were, every kid is different. There is no realistic way for parents to know what each kid would pick as their priorities on every issue... And even if there were a way to know that, parents are people too, and their preferences matter just as much as their kids' preferences. So, while it is perfectly acceptable to have different priorities than your parents did and wish that they had chosen to live by your priorities instead, being resentful is AH-ish \n\nOn the other hand, they *did* value a view over your privacy. That's not unreasonable of them, and there may have been a number of other benefits of living in that particular building that you weren't aware of (and that you would have missed out on if you were living in your hypothetical bigger but cheaper apartment). Calling you ungrateful for pointing out where their priorities lay was unfair of them. \n\nAnd anyone who says that you \"shouldn\u2019t complain since other people had it much worse\" is inherently being an AH. It's not a contest where only the person who had it worst gets to complain, we are all allowed to have things that disappointed us, no matter how fortunate we are in other areas\n\nESH", "ESH only because there is not enough info.
