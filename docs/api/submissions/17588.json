Also writing this on phone so sorry for any grammar mistakes.\n\n\nOk, so I (28f) LOVE dyeing my hair. Growing up I dealt with a lot of bullying which affected my self esteem and confidence. When I turned fifteen I experimented with hair dye and absolutely fell in love. It gave me a new found confidence and I started to make friends, join clubs and enjoy my high school experience. I currently still dye my hair but not as often, I usually only dye my hair 3-4 months a time.\n\nAnyways I have a daughter (5f) and for the sake of privacy we\u2019ll call her \u201cLily\u201d. Lily has been one of my biggest fans when it comes to dyeing my hair. Since she was about two she would help pick my hair colours and it\u2019s something me and her both love to do together. Lately Lily has been wanting to get her hair dyed since she\u2019s turned five and I\u2019ve been saying no for one reason. Hair damage. Like I said I\u2019ve been dyeing my hair for a while and the hair damage is REAL. I don\u2019t want that to happen to lily, I love her natural blonde hair and she does to, she\u2019s constantly asking for me to try new styles on her hair to see how they look etc.\n\nSince she\u2019s been asking I\u2019ve been putting it off explaining to her that she can get her hair dyed once she a little bit older but she was determined. So I just decided to do it for her happiness and to get her to stop begging every single day. While she was at school I got some pink hair dye that can easily be washed out. I also made sure to do A TON of research to make sure she was not allergic, or if it was healthy for her hair. Anyways I was able to find something and brought it home. Once she saw the hair dye her face lit up and honestly it made my heart melt! I made sure not to give her a whole head of pink hair and just did the ends. I also made sure that it wasn\u2019t some neon bright pink and that it would look nice with her hair. After we finished the result looked great! And she was over the moon with her new hair.\n\nNow here\u2019s where the problem starts. On Sunday my parents asked us to come over for a little barbecue celebration for Mother\u2019s Day, of course I agreed and me and Lily both went. Now my parents were never a fan of me dyeing my hair and they still aren\u2019t but they don\u2019t talk about it and seem to don\u2019t care as much anymore.\nOnce we got there all eyes were on Lily\u2019s hair and I immediately knew they weren\u2019t those \u201cOh my god, her hair is so pretty!\u201d Looks.\n\nAs soon as we stepped inside my Mother pulled me aside and asked my what I was thinking. I tried explaining that it\u2019s been something Lily really wanted and I didn\u2019t wanna disappoint her. I also mentioned that it wasn\u2019t like I gave her a full head of neon pink hair and that it removes easily. But she wasn\u2019t satisfied with this and gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the evening. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong but it\u2019s been brought up again so I\u2019m starting to think that it was a bad idea.

As soon as I could I started dyeing it, and hair doesn't grow back as quick when you are older. Long story short, now I love my natural hair. I think it is a good thing to let your child experiment, and they might come to this realization younger than I did. At the very least, they won't develop some weird hate relationship with their hair. It's just hair. It grows back.", "NTA. She is your daughter and you respected her wishes.

You did your research, and she got the look she wanted. All is well!\n\nIn the area where I live, lots of little kids have dyed hair to some extent. There\u2019s usually a few in my kids\u2019 elementary school classes at any given time.

It's her body, and your child.", "NTA. Absolutely you are not in the wrong. Your daughter's happiness is what matters, and what year is it exactly? I see people with dyed hair everywhere.

Kid\u2019s hair is completely different than adults hair.\nSTOP projecting your insecurities onto your kid", "This is a weird one, I guess kinda TA. You caved a bit too early. I think 8 would've been more appropriate personally so she could have time to really understand her hair and how to preserve it. At 5, she wouldn't quite understand everything that goes into dying one's hair. While I think the rinsable was a great call, it might be best to let this one fade, and try again at a later age.", "I hate when little kids have colored hair. It spoils  their natural beauty and perfection. The only reason she is obsessed with it is because you've conditioned her, involving her in your constant hair dying.
