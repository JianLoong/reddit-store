We went to the same high school and kept it touch a bit when we went off to different universities.\n\nLast night, Jen send me a long text about how I am plotting against her and making her feel jealous. The way she wrote it, she said it was **my** fault and **I** did this to her so she expected me to change. I told her that I'm sorry she feels this way but it's not my fault she's jealous and it's not my problem to fix it either. She called me an asshole and a bad friend because she thinks it is my problem to fix for making her feel that way.\n\nI think what made Jen blow up was this week I hung out with my uni friends but didn't invite Jen because she previously told me she disliked them. I'm not sure what Jen wants me to do here because we both have friend groups we don't invite each other in. It's normal.\n\nOther than that, in a very long text, Jen said that I deliberately make her feel jealous by   \na. being 'skinny and pretty' while she struggles to lose weight  \nb. having high grades while she is barely passing and getting into a 'better' uni than her  \nc. having guys (including her past crushes) confess to me  \nd. having a full time job while she is still looking  \ne. now dating a guy she had a crush on during elementary school who she expects me to not have dated at all to preserve her feelings\n\nWhile I feel bad for her, a lot of these things I can't help or I have worked really hard towards. I get good grades because I study hard while she chooses not to study and I go to the gym regularly. It's hard to hear someone complain about your successes and make you feel you don't deserve them when you worked hard for them. \n\nI am not plotting to ruin her life. On the contrary, I helped her with her studies, cleaned up her resume, and helped her apply to jobs. I think I've been a good friend to her these years but it's not my job to fix her insecurities. \n\nShe told our mutuals about this and they think I was an asshole for disregarding her feelings and telling her she can't/shouldn't feel that way.

Imagine playing a sport, and asking your friend to not perform well on purpose (and that\u2019s a game,  not life). Big NTA-anyone that expects friends not to do their best cause it makes them envious doesn\u2019t have their head on straight, or at very least, is very entitled.

Obviously, you or anyone else can't be making her feel in a certain way, only her own thoughts can, as feelings are based on one's own thoughts on a subject. At the moment, it looks like she can't think straight and so could benefit from therapy, but I very much doubt she'd like to hear that advice from you. And her feeling that you are plotting against her is a big red flag.\n\nDid you literally said that she can't or shouldn't feel that way? Well, she can feel that way, as she obviously does... And that she shouldn't... well, feelings don't magically  change by just wishing they shouldn't be there. \n\nIf you kind of defended yourself by saying that you worked hard for your accomplishments, it may sound in her ears that you in fact accused her of not working hard enough.

Jen sounds insufferably obnoxious. She should learn the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.

Neither is the other stuff.\n\nI get that she probably feels that all this comes easy for you; when in reality most is probably a product of more effort and a healthier lifestyle.\n\nShe suffers from main character syndrome, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.
