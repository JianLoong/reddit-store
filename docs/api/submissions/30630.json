Man I feel ya. I have family the same way. They were total clowns about life, having kids to early ruining their lives only to be constantly bailed out my mom or dad.

He'd call you a liar, and you could just reply with \"oh, a liar like you when you said you'd pay it back in the past?\"", "NTA.  If your parents are so hip to giving him money, let them do it.
