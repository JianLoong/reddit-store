He deserves it.", "NTA, but on the bright side he knows your well is now dry. Maybe he will actually get a job! Parents and brother definitely AH. Does your mother think it\u2019s brothers right to take what is yours?", "i think your mom is main problem in this story. NTA never give him a cent again", "My brother does the same. Still to this day. I am 42 he is 50 with a job ( well paying!) every month for years he would ask for a loan never to pay back. So I cut him off. Told him to never contact me again. It lasted  8 months. He asked again.I ignored him.He even at one stage got his one child (16)to ask me for money. It got to this point that he turned my whole family against me so I only have my inlaws now(they are awesome)", "Damn dude.   I can't believe you held up your end of the bargain.   Honorable brother even when you have been treated without the same respect.  I highly respect it.", "Nope Nta. Let moochers be known for well known moochers they are.

When my dad laughed and called him stupid for giving him $100 because he was never going to see that money again,  uncle smart asked my dad how much money he had $5-10 given uncle mooch over the years... That $100 was a lifetime investment, large enough in one chunk to be remembered and small enough to be fair forever payout.", "Of course your brother is talking about leaving before Thanksgiving, he's got his \ud83d\udcb8 NTA", "NTA.  Now everyone knows where they stand they can move forward.

You should be proud of yourself for not getting railroaded again and again. \n Many of us have leach family members.

Now you want Y. Consider me not going after you for X, a gift instead Of Y. Debt is now written off.

You shouldn't loan money out to any relative that you can not write off unless they sign an official agreement but you already knew that because of your past experience with your brother.
