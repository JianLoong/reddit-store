You spoke up when others were likely feeling the same frustration. Sometimes, expressing displeasure can help improve the overall atmosphere for everyone else. So, not the AH for me.", "Boo for the right reasons tho. Men singing badly at Karaoke is fine, that\u2019s why karaoke is fun.

I'll edit this comment later if I come up with one.\n\nBut, here's a piece of advice for anyone who wants to disrupt obnoxious TikTokers. Play Disney music as loud as you possibly can. That way, they can't use the footage without getting a copyright violation. The Mouse does not fuck around when it comes to that stuff.", "I think the day tictoc dies will be the happiest day. All these people who want to be internet famous is getting so annoying. I have accidentally gotten into people's shots and they get mad and I said this is a public area. It's not your film studio and keep going on my business. I've seen people do stupid stuff in supermarkets, restaurants and all the stuff and it's just so annoying. No one cares. I bet you enough to do that crap in public\n\nNta", "NTA - sounds like an appropriate response to an intentionally negative, public spectacle. I applaud your support of these dudes!", "NTA.  If they want to film themselves singing poorly, they should do it at their own house, not in a place where they have to inflict that suffering on other people.", "I'm going to default to NTA. If you want to film a shitty Tiktok where you sing badly don't annoy and inconvenience others in the process. At that point, they absolutely deserved to be booed.", "YTA but like in a heroic way! Booing is rude but it sounds like what they did was very disrespectful. Well done for beating them at their own game!", "ESH - he was laying out bait and you took it but you both presumably paid the same to do what you wanted with your time on the mic", "Did everyone clap after they left?", "Yta", "What a dumb post\n\nDo you really need an answer to this or were you just looking for an excuse to share your experience", "NTA TikTok is an evil Chinese spyware that should be banned and you were right to call them out for it.", "Hmm, while I think it was rude to boo them, and maybe unnecessary, if they wanted to do that they should have done it somewhere private or a place where people aren\u2019t using it.

I\u2019d give a group one intentionally bad song because karaoke is a fun and funny vibe. However a whole set of terrible singing, no. And filming it for TT, he\u2019ll no.", "Strongly disagree, I'm a karaoke enthusiast and it's obnoxious as hell when drunk bros go up and sing Britney or something terribly on purpose. Doing that in Asian style private room karaoke is fine, it's just your own friends you're irritating, but for Western style bar karaoke you are interacting with the whole audience and you should try to have fun with everyone, not deliberately torture them. It's an AH move to make strangers uncomfortable on purpose. If you are just a bad singer but are committed in earnest I don't care, good for you for putting yourself out there, but people being bad on purpose suck majorly.", "Genius. I should start doing this when I see people doing tictoc dances in the middle of a crowded public area", "I remember an aita where a sister did this to her brother and all the footage was unusable", "Lol no but people were able to enjoy themselves.", "People in my group said I was an AH so I came here for judgement", "Can I ask if this is a ah response? Could we take a vote?", "Wait til you hear about facebook", "You can tell. There was a dipshit in the grocery store yesterday with his 2 friends recording something for TikTok. He walked up to the self check out with 2 self serve donuts and started yelling \u201cHOW DO I SCAN A DONUT?! CAN SOMEONE HELP ME WITH THE BARCODE ON A DONUT?!\u201d His one friend was filing him. The other was filming people\u2019s reactions. So dumb.", "That\u2019s kinda my point, singing badly is part of the karaoke experience. But I agree singing bad on purpose is silly, especially for a Tic Tac video.", "No. It\u2019s karaoke, you\u2019re already opening yourself up to the crowd response. And If you sing intentionally poorly then you gotta accept whatever happens", "Am I going crazy?\n\nRegardless of whether you were arguably justified - and it sounds like they weee obnoxious and ignorant - it\u2019s still an asshole move to boo someone doing karaoke just because they sing badly. We can\u2019t read people\u2019s minds and definitely know their views and thoughts.", "I'm not into karaoke so I dont know the etiquette, but isn't the point that you don't badly and entertain your friends? This isn't a talent show...", "Bro was being annoying. Nobody liked it. \n\nYou called him out. Everybody like it.\n\nNTA.", "ESH. I thought that was the point? I get you felt they were singing poorly on purpose but I was always under the impression the point was to be able to sing your favorite songs despite not necessarily being a good singer.", "Info: are you and all your friends flawless singers? Why does it matter to you how someone else enjoys themselves?\n\nIsn't part of karaoke that it's done frequently by people who can't sing? This seems like gatekeeping to me. They seemed to be enjoying themselves and they seem to have waited for their turn. What does it matter if they filmed themselves? Without more info it seems clear cut YTA.", "NTA- They were for all the reasons you listed", "NTA\nSure booing is rude, but if they\u2019re being obnoxious on purpose that ruins it for everyone else.", "YTA, it\u2019s karaoke not a concert. If they were hogging the stage to film TikToks they deserved to be called out but like. Most people go to karaoke bars to sing badly on purpose for fun, it\u2019s not a crime. You went for a low blow insult instead of maturely asking them to stop hogging the stage.", "ESH\n\nFirst off, Karaoke is about having fun, not whether you're a star caliber singer, unless it's a Karaoke competition. Sometimes, that means goofing off and being silly and/or deliberately tanking songs.\n\nHe came off the stage and confronted you for Booing him, something the entire audience should/would have been doing if they were truly that annoyed. It sounds like the guys might've been trying to create the video or doing a livestream to prove that no one will boo you at Karaoke, no matter how badly you perform. You boo'd them, proving that wrong.\n\nYou knew they were deliberately performing badly, and yet you decided to tell one of them that he was a bad singer. You don't know if that's really true or not, since their poor performance was intentional.\n\nLighten up and learn to play along.", "Nah man.

If I had to guess probably wannabes."]}
