I (26F) thought it was genius so I did exactly that with my babies onesies that they recently outgrew\u2026 fast forward a few days later & my pregnant sister in law (35F) messages me on Instagram (I posted a story showing & informing others of the hack) \u2026 I\u2019ll copy & paste her message \u201cHi there and also wtf!?? Why would you mutilate your babies old clothes instead of going to the store & buying new ones like a normal person? I know you didn\u2019t grow up with family but traditionally someone with a baby with hand down the old clothes to the next family member in need??? You know I\u2019m due in 6 weeks so how could you be so inconsiderate & just disregard me?? Forget about coming to the christening!!\u201d \u2026she\u2019s right, I didn\u2019t grow up with family, so maybe I\u2019m in the wrong & this is an unspoken rule\u2026 but I don\u2019t understand why she never mentioned this to me. I donated his earlier outgrown things to a second hand shop\u2026 her & her husband are very boujee so it never occurred to me they would want/need my sons hand me downs. Her husband even got a new car recently so I know they\u2019re not struggling financially. I feel guilty but also a bit annoyed because I think she\u2019s overreacting not wanting me at the christening. AITA???\n\n\nEdit: some of you said she might be lying about her financial situation, I assure you she\u2019s not\u2026 her house is four times bigger than ours with a private pool (both my husband & I earn a lot of money but prefer a smaller house), she has two older children who are 12 & 15 that always have the best of everything\u2026 latest iPhone/Apple Watch/AirPods\u2026 expensive sneakers, new clothes etc. she also has her own car so her husband didn\u2019t go into debt getting his new one. & they both vacation to tropical destinations multiple times per year. So I\u2019m not assuming she\u2019s too boujee for my sons hand me downs\u2026 she just *is* boujee & I never considered that she would want them. \n\nUpdate: so she finally responded to my husband\u2019s angry text telling her that even though he\u2019s the godfather, neither of us would be showing our faces if I\u2019m not welcome. She called him & cussed him out at first then started crying saying it\u2019s the hormones & of course we are both welcome. He said that\u2019s not good enough & she owes me an apology. She begrudgingly agreed & when he handed me the phone she said \u201cI had no right to speak to you that way. You know how pregnancy can be, I was stressed & took it out on you. Please don\u2019t be the reason my brother doesn\u2019t show up for his godchild\u2019s big day\u201d \u2026I responded \u201cokay, let\u2019s try to put this behind us.

But it's not like you threw them away. You put them to good use and saved some money. \n\nI was given so many used baby clothes when I had my first child, but then I was also gifted so many new things from my extended family. I hardly bought anything myself, but I had so many boxes filling up my basement. And then my first child was born during a hot summer, so most of the time he just wore a diaper, sometimes a onesie. I hardly needed anything that was gifted to me. And when my daughter was born, I was again gifted so many clothes, used and new. It was crazy. I could have dressed 5 babies with the clothes I got.\n\nI recently brought all the old baby clothes to a second hand shop. They sold quickly and I made a little money for my kids' piggy banks. It makes so much more sense than holding on to them for family members that could potentially use them. Most likely they will just sit in the basement until you get rid of them anyway.\n\nI do get why a family member could get upset though (my BIL was upset at me too at first, he and his gf just had their first child and were expecting to get our old things), especially if this has been a tradition in your family for a while. But honestly, just send those new parents to a second hand store for babies.

They grow so fast they'll never wear it all.", "NTA. If she wanted hand-me-downs she could have let you know.

Maybe SIL should try that instead of assuming they're owed it and berating OP when they're not aware of those assumptions. \n\nThere has been a bit of a baby boom in several of my circles over the last few years. A few people were very explicit about us *not* buying them baby clothes because they already had at least a year's worth of handed down clothes from people they knew with slightly older kids.", "maybe it's time to stop leeting an adult woman bully you and send your husband messages.", "She's not entitled to your old baby clothes, and her making your presence at the christening dependent on it is a massive AH move.\n\nShe's basically saying there's a cost to attend, which is bonkers.

She has some nerve.", "Fyi I don\u2019t have a kid but I still want to share my opinion that they can do what they want and her child is still using the baby clothes.

I remember where I was, financially, at 26 and I would have _needed_ to modify kids clothes to get more wear out of them. Extending this thought, is your SIL expecting you to buy everything new, and they get hand-me-downs and never have to buy anything?

Just expecting to be given stuff without asking is narcissistic as hell.  If she had asked and you said yea sure that is something else but that doesn't sound like that happened at all.

Yes, if some people have a lot of extra or don\u2019t care to do something sentimental (which is fine- I didn\u2019t), and make a choice to donate, that\u2019s one thing, but I\u2019ve never heard of passing along a baby\u2019s clothes like family memorabilia.

They're your clothes and you can do what you want with them. She can absolutely ask if you have spares, but expecting them is just entitled.

You can also volunteer to work shifts during the sale and get more $ back on your own sales depending on the amount of time you volunteer. It\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019ve found so much awesome stuff for my kids, some with original price tags still on them for a 1/4 the cost.", "It's not about struggling financially, it's about not being wasteful.

I drive a 15 year old car, not because I can't afford a new car, but because I've taken good care of this one and it meets my needs until it gets to the point that repairs aren't worth it.  Meanwhile, I've known lots of people who are house poor or otherwise take loans or use credit to have newer fancier things than I care to bother with who all would seem by external appearances to be better off financially than I am, but live paycheck and to paycheck, are behind on other bills, or have no savings or or other investments.
