If you don't follow the tradition in your family, or even know about it, you can't be expected to carry it out.\n\n This particular traditional is made to reuse baby clothes as they grow out them quick, so it means they get used again.

What ever happened to 'dont ask, don't get'? If she wanted them, she could have asked. Wouldn't she want to pick her own stuff anyway, like a 'normal' person?\n\nYou're right to be annoyed, but maybe cut her some slack as she's pregnant and probably not her best self right now.

Your SIL is a nasty piece of work, and your husband needs to call her out on her BS. I think that hack sounds like a great idea. Babies grow so quickly, and that's a great way to make clothes last longer.", "OP, you're NTA. One, using used things for hacks that can save you money is GENIUS, you didn't do anything wrong there, and you are perfectly normal. And also, it is very selfish for a person to expect a relative to give their children's clothes, especially without asking beforehand. Your SIL seems to feel very entitled in regards to that. Don't feel guilty at all.\n\nI am not really sure how the 'hand-me-down' thing applies to extended family, but no one is entitled to it.", "Why doesnt she go to store ans buy her baby new things like a \"normal person\"?", "NTA\n\nIt makes absolute sense to give away used baby clothes for several reasons. But it's not like you threw them away. You put them to good use and saved some money. \n\nI was given so many used baby clothes when I had my first child, but then I was also gifted so many new things from my extended family. I hardly bought anything myself, but I had so many boxes filling up my basement. And then my first child was born during a hot summer, so most of the time he just wore a diaper, sometimes a onesie. I hardly needed anything that was gifted to me. And when my daughter was born, I was again gifted so many clothes, used and new. It was crazy. I could have dressed 5 babies with the clothes I got.\n\nI recently brought all the old baby clothes to a second hand shop. They sold quickly and I made a little money for my kids' piggy banks. It makes so much more sense than holding on to them for family members that could potentially use them. Most likely they will just sit in the basement until you get rid of them anyway.\n\nI do get why a family member could get upset though (my BIL was upset at me too at first, he and his gf just had their first child and were expecting to get our old things), especially if this has been a tradition in your family for a while. But honestly, just send those new parents to a second hand store for babies. There are so many of them that only sell clothes that are as good as new for 1-3 bucks a piece.", "NTA but if you feel guilty give her like two or three that are already kinda small or just aren't that pretty. It's not an unspoken rule but some families do that kind of stuff. I got a lot of clothes from my cousins when I was young.", "NTA- It looks as though she was looking for a reason to keep you out.

Although weak, this is the reason she chose.  \nNTA", "NTA I grew up in a huge family. There was some handing down of baby clothes, but it was mostly nicer dressy stuff. The everyday stuff like onesies were usually ruined with stains and no one wanted those, LOL. My sister has two little boys and has boxes of unworn baby clothes that she was gifted. They grow so fast they'll never wear it all.", "NTA. If she wanted hand-me-downs she could have let you know. You don\u2019t need to be poor to take hand-me-downs, many people do it for environmental reasons or convenience. But her messaging you with no prior conversation was way out of line.", "Her rude ass doesent deserve clothes from anybody.She can buy new ones in stores.", "NTA. IMO she is trying to make you look bad by secretly uninviting you so it looks like you just didn\u2019t show up. \nAlso there\u2019s no tradition of handing down clothes. Sometimes you do it, sometimes you don\u2019t. But you\u2019re still actively using the clothes and she\u2019s not even having the same gender as you are.

Actually my family doesn't do christenings so idk what that even is", "NTA. She's so entitled to have never mentioned this before. They're your baby's old clothes. You choose what you do with them.", "NTA\n\nI used to hand down my daughter's clothes to a family member and never saw her kid wear any of the clothes.  After a bit, another family member told me the clothes were getting sold at a consignment shop.  I started giving all the clothes to another family who actually used them.", "NTA I have had a lot of hand me downs and I love swapping clothes. To make a new type of clothing is just as good as giving it to the next person since in my head it's really about not wasting/buying new stuff when you don't need to. I think what you did was great. Idk what \"growing up with family\" has to do with it", "NTA she\u2019s just a bully and looking for a way to bring up that you didn\u2019t grow up with family.

As for the christening... have a fun day out with your kid", "Also, most new parents find themselves inundated with gifts of new baby clothes/newborn onesies that they never get around to using because babies grow so fast. She\u2019s out of order to treat her this way.", "My impression is that getting your hands on handed down baby clothes is not exactly difficult and a polite ask might get you more than you actually need. Maybe SIL should try that instead of assuming they're owed it and berating OP when they're not aware of those assumptions. \n\nThere has been a bit of a baby boom in several of my circles over the last few years. A few people were very explicit about us *not* buying them baby clothes because they already had at least a year's worth of handed down clothes from people they knew with slightly older kids.", "maybe it's time to stop leeting an adult woman bully you and send your husband messages.", "She's not entitled to your old baby clothes, and her making your presence at the christening dependent on it is a massive AH move.\n\nShe's basically saying there's a cost to attend, which is bonkers.

She has some nerve.", "Fyi I don\u2019t have a kid but I still want to share my opinion that they can do what they want and her child is still using the baby clothes. I get it might be helpful to have some clothes for the baby but they do not have the right to make that decision. Plus it\u2019s already been done so now what will she say? Uninviting her is unfair because it\u2019s BABY CLOTHES we are talking about. NTA I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with her.", "She doesn't even want the hand me downs, she just wants to make you feel bad. I'm sorry. It's horrible of her to bring up you having what sounds like a difficult childhood to shame you about reusing your baby clothes. You are allowed to do whatever you want with them!", "Wait. She\u2019s mad that you didn\u2019t give her all your sons clothes and she\u2019s not even having a boy? She\u2019s psycho. Tell your husband to deal with her or you\u2019ll be posting a screenshot of her message on your IG to show everyone just how ugly she is. Even if she was also having a boy she wouldn\u2019t be entitled to your clothes. Clothes you\u2019re still using BTW. She was just looking for a reason to uninvited you, but I bet she will tell everyone you didn\u2019t show up bc you are jealous of her.", "Good for him! He needs to stand United with you!", "You won't be the reason for the family dispute, SIL would be. Don't forget this, even if family members expect you to be the \"bigger person\" and not rock the boat and ignore SIL's part in all of this. \n\nPeople might play it down as a minor issue, \"just baby clothes\", but starting with boundaries early can save you a lot of grief in future. \n \nShe's has about ten more years on you to get the hang of adulting and socialising, it's fair to expect her to act like it. Not your fault should she not be able to"]}
