While passing down baby clothes is very common (not at all a tradition thing, just a fact of convenience because of how fast kids outgrow them), there's no reason for any single person to think that you OWE them your baby's clothes. What you do with your property is your choice and yours alone.", "NTA no one is entitled to the things you have bought. Some of my friends keep their kids clothes and turn them into quilts -i personally like your hack. It\u2019s totally up to you what you do with any thing you have bought or been gifted PERIOD", "NTA. While, we did hand me downs for stuff like snowsuits and shoes when we were older. It wasn\u2019t expected. You are under no obligation to give her your baby clothes. She can buy her child their own clothes from what you said in your post. \nAlso reusing your baby clothes in that way sounds wonderful!", "NTA\n\nIt would be a bonus if you handed them down. It should not be an expectation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like you set them on fire to spite her! You\u2019ve done something lovely and useful with them. \n\nAt least you\u2019ve gotten out of needing to get a christening present, right? Delete the comment knowing you did nothing wrong.", "nta in anyway or form", "NTA - she doesn\u2019t have a \u2018right\u2019 to your babies old clothes. If you managed to repurpose them, great. \n\nIMO this tradition probably exists because of convenience and because kids grow fast - which is exactly why the \u2018hack\u2019 exists.\n\nIt\u2019s your choice what you do. I\u2019d probably bite the bullet with the next size up and donate them to SIL, but that\u2019d be purely a cost:benefit thing for the sake of the relationship (rather than because I thought she had the right to have them).", "Nta. There is no unspoken rule. They are your clothes to do with as you want. Cut cut cut away.", "Nta tell her if she needs clothes for the baby so badly, her hubby can sell his car. Why does she want to mooch off your possessions.", "NTA, you are being thrifty and frugal. Your little will get more use, and after those shirts can be used as teddy bear clothes or to make quilts. You SIL is a bit unhinged, keep an eye out on that one.", "NTA, she is entitled and rude. People that that are not worth the effort.", "NTA g they are your clothes and you can do whatever you want with them. Keep an eye on your SIL because she sounds crazy.\n\nIf you want to get back at her tell other family members in a group chat, dinner, etc that she is poor and struggling. Spread it around the family that she can't afford baby clothes and needs money. Bonus points if she confronts you in front of others and you ask her \"if you aren't poor, why did you seem so desperate to get my baby's old clothes?\"", "NTA- I have seen some really cute craft ideas repurposing old baby clothes into quilts, stuffed animals, and even a Christmas tree blanket for the bottom of a tree. It\u2019s still reusing them and you can keep them as memories.\n\n\nI don\u2019t even have any family with babies to hand down clothes. If she really needs hand me down baby clothes, you could tell her to check out Buy Nothing groups on Facebook. I got 80% of my child\u2019s clothes from there the first year and then got rid of many of them the same way.", "Hand-me-downs are nice, but in no way an obligation.

WHAT A BIZARRE THING FOR SIL TO SAY/DO!! Hand me downs are not a given, and why does she even care?  Hoping her partner can possibly help her see reason on this? I would hate for OP to miss christening of a niece/nephew/nibling if it is important to them just because SIL is entitled AF.", "NTA you have the right to reuse stuff like that. You should not be forced to buy something new just because someone else wants it. Also, she could buy her own and follow that hack.", "NTA.  SIL is a cruel bully and is mocking you. She would probably laugh in your face if you offered her the baby clothes.  It is not an unspoken rule btw.  I am from a huge family and no one ever asks or expects someone's baby clothes but if someone offers and the new mother is interested, then it happens.  \n\nProbably not the first time this AH has treated you poorly, is it?  I would ignore her, any response, either angry or contrite, will only feed the beast that is this women's ego.  Stay away from her as much as possible.  She is a troublemaker.  \n\nHave you talked to your husband about this bizarre text?  I'm assuming she is your husband's sister or his brother's wife?
