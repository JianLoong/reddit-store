Just not yours?", "Reading your other post, you need to get out of that relationship yesterday.", "I assume your age difference brings a lot of hostility with it?", "Th\u00e9 marriage is kept together because OP has *zero* self respect.", "I was thinking she got a nice salad as her main and added chicken breast or something like that.  Salads often have options for main meal size or a side dish size which fits in with stepdaughter changing her mind on her side dish.", "Good god, what an ass. My bio dad at least pretended he was dad of year. Too bad all the emotional abuse disqualified him from that award. My stepmom ended up leaving him recently because he and his family are so toxic and awful. Felt like validation for what I experienced. Mine thought he\u2019d be the best grandpa ever and he\u2019ll never see either of his granddaughters.", "In our household bio is always just father. Dad is dad. Was that way for me and it\u2019s that way for my daughter. She loves her dad a ton, her father got the opportunity to be in her life and in less than week received LC status.  \u201cSp*rm makes a man a father, heart makes a man a dad\u201d", "An entr\u00e9e is a dish that you have before the main course, it means 'entry', as in entry to the meal.\n\nEdit: Oops, see this was already answered. Of course the US is fucking weird about it. In what world would entry mean main? What do you call entr\u00e9es then?", "Oh it was. And I fully expect him to reach out in the future because of that, knowing what I know now. \n\nBut you know what\u2019s great? My stepmom left him and his family too. He\u2019s left with his toxic ass family that he kept choosing over me (and her apparently). Felt super fucking validating.", "?\n\nI'm confused.  You all got what you ordered, right?  Then SD decided she wanted your food?  You then ordered her temhe same thing, she got it, and ate it?\n\nWhy is anyone mad?\n\nNTA and you sure you want to be involved with these people?", "You could have shared until more came to the table.  Avid even if she is a spoiled little shit, you could have role modeled what mature looks like. Either way, not a great move on your part.", "[removed]", "Heck no!  You are \ud83d\udcaf in the right!  What\u2019s the big deal?  You ordered more for her, why are they mad at all?", "NTA... not sure where the entitlement comes from.", "You can have nearly everything I own (that\u2019s easy cause I don\u2019t own much!), but stay away from my plate. It\u2019s mine! Stay away! NTA all the way!", "There\u2019s no question in my mind something more happening in this situation.", "So you ordered her what she wanted and she and her father are mad at you?? She didn't want the item, she wanted you to be deprived of it as some sort of power play.\n\nSerious counseling is in order here.\n\nNTA, but your husband and his daughter are. \ud83d\udea9", "NTA", "NTA Stepdaughter is entitled and her dad is enabling the behaviour", "NTA, she's the AH for asking for your food.", "NTA.

Nobody should come before your kids, I'm not backing down on that point and if you think otherwise that's fine.", "What if they were never married in the first place. Should they just be two single people for 18 years? Or what if the kid doesn't even remember them being married?\n\nAre there exceptions to your rule?", "Ideally yes. And if you do date before the kids turn 18 they should not meet your new partner until they're adults. Your children are your main focus and if having a partner interferes with that/causes conflict, you have a duty as a parent to put your kids first. Your happiness comes second to the well being of your kids.", "That has nothing to do with the food. OP asked judgment for what she did and not her family dynamics.", "Ordering the dish for the stepdaughter is not a great move? How? This is what a mature person looks like, she ordered some more for her stepdaughter instead of just saying no and asking her to eat what she had ordered.", "Oooof", "THIS! I was about to say this. As a step-mom to a 11F and 15M, if my husband and I aren\u2019t a solid foundation, everything would be an absolute wreck. Especially since their mother creates a very toxic environment in our home (I could write a book and you still couldn\u2019t believe it). But always going to Daddy when SM says no will become an issue when there\u2019s not a strong foundation. NTA"]}
