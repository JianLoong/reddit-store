What does \u201ca man no less\u201d mean?

Especially with the last bit, about maybe not wanting him to attend at all. I guess for me, not wanting someone your partner\u2019s slept with to be in the wedding party regardless of gender isn\u2019t a big deal, not wanting someone they\u2019re really close with platonically and had a past physical relationship with but who has never done anything to threaten your relationship to attend at all is a bit unreasonable, and saying \u2018I don\u2019t want this *man* he\u2019s slept with\u2019 involved means you need to look into your heart and figure out why you\u2019re exhibiting biphobia. \n\nYTA.
