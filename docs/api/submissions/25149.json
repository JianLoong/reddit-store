What does \u201ca man no less\u201d mean?

I guess for me, not wanting someone your partner\u2019s slept with to be in the wedding party regardless of gender isn\u2019t a big deal, not wanting someone they\u2019re really close with platonically and had a past physical relationship with but who has never done anything to threaten your relationship to attend at all is a bit unreasonable, and saying \u2018I don\u2019t want this *man* he\u2019s slept with\u2019 involved means you need to look into your heart and figure out why you\u2019re exhibiting biphobia. \n\nYTA.

But it really doesn't make sense for you to be fine with their friendship, which you know is very close, but to then not want him to have his best friend there when you say your vows. \n\nI'm going to assume there's a reason the best friend attended this event where your fiance proposed; your fiance likely wanted him there. I do not think there will be a wedding if you try to stop his best friend from being up there. \n\nIn normal circumstances I'd understand not wanting a past lover there, but you've welcomed this man into your life otherwise. So that's completely crazy. \n\nYTA for that.", "So you\u2019re marrying a bisexual man? Why? You\u2019re clearly not comfortable with it. YTA.

If the genders were different and we were talking about a \u2018best woman\u2019, you know the replies here would be very different. I don\u2019t blame you for feeling the way you do at all. You haven\u2019t said anything to anyone yet and you\u2019re trying to sort out your feelings. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for having feelings. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think your partner or his friend are doing anything wrong either. You\u2019ve accepted their relationship and say you\u2019re not jealous, so to make a big deal of it now doesn\u2019t seem right. There\u2019s no easy answer. If he doesn\u2019t choose his best friend to be his best man there will be a lot of hurt feelings on all sides. You\u2019d basically be asking him to choose, you or his best friend. It\u2019s likely he would go with the friend. \n\nI would say: your feelings of discomfort are valid but ask yourself if it\u2019s worth saying anything and potentially causing a lot of drama and hurt. Probably not.
