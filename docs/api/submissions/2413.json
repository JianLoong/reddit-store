Gonna keep this short because I'm still baffled. \n\nI, (24f) am currently raising my 2 brothers (18m, 13m) after my mother died this past September. Only my brothers and I live here and when my other brother (21m) completes rehab he will be living here as well. I am the only girl in the house. Onto the issue. \n\nI have a friend, we'll call her Zaylee (23f) who came over to hang out with me last week. For context, I have the nexplanon birth control bar in my arm. I know it's different for everyone, but for me it completely takes away my period and lasts for 3 years. (This is my second time having itl) We were having a movie day to catch up on life since we haven't seen each other in over a week. During one of the movies she gets up to use the restroom so I scroll through my phone waiting on her return. \n\nWell when she comes back down she asks me where I keep my tampons. I responded I don't keep them in the house since I haven't needed one in years. She then proceeded to ask me for a pad and I kinda just giggled and repeated myself. I'm not sure if it was the giggle or lack of products but she completely flips out on me. \"What kind of woman doesn't keep these things?\" \"As a woman you should always keep them?\" \"What the hell am I supposed to do about my situation?\" \"I've never met someone so thoughtless!\"\n\nI was confused. I didn't take her attitude to heart and told her we can go to the Dollar General around the corner if she needs some and that it's not a big deal. Apparently that wasn't good enough for her. She called me an insensitive bitch who doesn't care about other women (??) and need to learn how to be a better host. She called herself a cab and left shortly after. \n\nI can understand the frustration of not having something you need, but lashing out on me made no sense.

Since you have all brothers living with you, they wouldn\u2019t be using them either, so more reason to not keep unnecessary products in the house taking up space. Your friend is a woman who gets her period, she should know to carry an extra tampon or two around in her bag for situations like this, I mean, come on, she\u2019s 23! This surely isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been somewhere and needed a menstrual product, she should know to keep a spare on her just in case.", "NTA\nYour friend is. You should have countered with, \"what kind of woman doesn't carry their own feminine hygiene products for their own needs?\"", "NTA. Your friend was extremely rude! I never assume anything like that is available at other's houses.

You know, like an adult? Your friend's behaviour is bizarre to me.", "NTA - I've used a cup, period panties, and reusable pads for the last 5 years. I might have a bag of leftover tampons under my bathroom sink for guests, but if I'm ever out and about and realize I need a menstrual product, I just use toilet paper as a liner until I'm able to get home.

I did not buy any feminine hygiene products at all until my daughters started their cycles.

I won't have them in my home and anyone who needs them that visits, better come prepared.

And mostly for the laughter.\n\nLook, I get it.  You're free of the damned things and that's nice and you don't live with someone who menstruates so it seems like something you don't need to have on-hand.  It's nice not to even have to think about it.\n\nI'm also on long-term birth control (to deal with medical issues) and haven't had a period in a blissfully long time.  I still keep a pack of pads in my bathroom because though I rarely have guests, plenty of the ones I do have menstruate.  My period was so irregular and *heavy* and awful that I know sometimes you just get caught off-guard even if you're in the habit of always carrying some with you - and I assure you, with periods like that I absolutely was - so I always keep some around in case someone needs them.\n\nHonestly, I think it's not a bad idea for guys to keep a pack of pads stored away in their bathroom, either.  Plenty who have sisters, female friends, and girlfriends over frequently do.\n\nIt's just not that expensive to keep a single package of pads in the bathroom.  If only guests are ever using them, and only when they themselves don't have one on-hand, they last *ages.*\n\nYour friend was probably at least partly embarrassed (so your laughter did not likely help), but that doesn't excuse the level of response she gave you - *especially* once you offered to go get some.  If coming with you was a problem (it can be in these situations!) she could have given you some money and had you go get them alone.  There was no need for the way she spoke to you.  It was rich of her to talk about how you're not prepared when she clearly got caught off-guard and unprepared herself.  \n\nAs I said, it happens, I get it, but she doesn't get to blame others for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They'd sometimes make runs for my mom or me back when we did need them.", "Bit of toilet paper works in a pinch if something actually happened. Not every woman or person who menatrates carries a purse either. \n\nAlso like what if she used a mental cup?", "Damn I still have a period and I don't carry emergency products at all times. I need them for like 4 days why would I carry one all 30", "I wonder if She'd just leaked particularly badly and wad projecting. \nor if she was having a bad period- the idea of someone not having one can make you pretty mad ( have had similar unexplained rage)", "I vaguely remember reading that a lot of soldiers or field medics keep tampons in their kits to plug bullet holes", "I had stomach surgery recently and they told me to tape a pad over the incision!", "Tampons have also been used for bullet and other penatrating wounds. When blood is gushing from a wound, you stop it up any way you can.", "I had a nosebleed while driving once, the only thing I could grab was a pad - then I hit traffic lights and glanced at the guy in the car next to me, he stared back at me and I realised I was holding a very blood soaked sanitary towel on my face. I don't think he realised it was a nosebleed.", "Me either, but to be fair, I don't think I've ever had any last 5 years", "Me too. That part had me thinking they thought OP was an a-hole but with a few more replies I now see what they meant. So u/joniangel2776 you weren't the only one thinking this.", "I\u2019m guessing your periods are more regular than mine. 3-5 weeks, any time of day or day of the week. Easier to just stuff a single pad in my purse/gymbag than have to scrub blood out of yet more clothes.", "IIRC, tampons were invented for bullet wounds.", "Yeah everyone has a different experience, so I didn't feel that saying \"Did you carry them when you had periods? Or did you go around expecting other people to give you their emergency stash?\" Was fair, as if those are the only two options, either carry them always or take from others. No, I don't carry them, and I also don't go around expecting other people to give me their emergency stash, and that could be the same case for the person you're replying to. Not very nice to assume that they're either carrying products or taking from others.", "I am a woman, I also have three younger sisters. I didn\u2019t get a period for over a decade due to BC. If one of them had been over and had their period, we would have needed to go on a run to the store. \n\nIf you don\u2019t use them, and there is no one in your household who uses them, then it is not your responsibility to have them. It certainly doesn\u2019t make you an AH for not having them."]}
