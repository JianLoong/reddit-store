Gonna keep this short because I'm still baffled. \n\nI, (24f) am currently raising my 2 brothers (18m, 13m) after my mother died this past September. Only my brothers and I live here and when my other brother (21m) completes rehab he will be living here as well. I am the only girl in the house. Onto the issue. \n\nI have a friend, we'll call her Zaylee (23f) who came over to hang out with me last week. For context, I have the nexplanon birth control bar in my arm. I know it's different for everyone, but for me it completely takes away my period and lasts for 3 years. (This is my second time having itl) We were having a movie day to catch up on life since we haven't seen each other in over a week. During one of the movies she gets up to use the restroom so I scroll through my phone waiting on her return. \n\nWell when she comes back down she asks me where I keep my tampons. I responded I don't keep them in the house since I haven't needed one in years. She then proceeded to ask me for a pad and I kinda just giggled and repeated myself. I'm not sure if it was the giggle or lack of products but she completely flips out on me. \"What kind of woman doesn't keep these things?\" \"As a woman you should always keep them?\" \"What the hell am I supposed to do about my situation?\" \"I've never met someone so thoughtless!\"\n\nI was confused. I didn't take her attitude to heart and told her we can go to the Dollar General around the corner if she needs some and that it's not a big deal. Apparently that wasn't good enough for her. She called me an insensitive bitch who doesn't care about other women (??) and need to learn how to be a better host. She called herself a cab and left shortly after. \n\nI can understand the frustration of not having something you need, but lashing out on me made no sense.

Since you have all brothers living with you, they wouldn\u2019t be using them either, so more reason to not keep unnecessary products in the house taking up space. Your friend is a woman who gets her period, she should know to carry an extra tampon or two around in her bag for situations like this, I mean, come on, she\u2019s 23! This surely isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been somewhere and needed a menstrual product, she should know to keep a spare on her just in case.", "NTA\nYour friend is.

And mostly for the laughter.\n\nLook, I get it.  You're free of the damned things and that's nice and you don't live with someone who menstruates so it seems like something you don't need to have on-hand.  It's nice not to even have to think about it.\n\nI'm also on long-term birth control (to deal with medical issues) and haven't had a period in a blissfully long time.  I still keep a pack of pads in my bathroom because though I rarely have guests, plenty of the ones I do have menstruate.  My period was so irregular and *heavy* and awful that I know sometimes you just get caught off-guard even if you're in the habit of always carrying some with you - and I assure you, with periods like that I absolutely was - so I always keep some around in case someone needs them.\n\nHonestly, I think it's not a bad idea for guys to keep a pack of pads stored away in their bathroom, either.  Plenty who have sisters, female friends, and girlfriends over frequently do.\n\nIt's just not that expensive to keep a single package of pads in the bathroom.  If only guests are ever using them, and only when they themselves don't have one on-hand, they last *ages.*\n\nYour friend was probably at least partly embarrassed (so your laughter did not likely help), but that doesn't excuse the level of response she gave you - *especially* once you offered to go get some.  If coming with you was a problem (it can be in these situations!) she could have given you some money and had you go get them alone.  There was no need for the way she spoke to you.  It was rich of her to talk about how you're not prepared when she clearly got caught off-guard and unprepared herself.  \n\nAs I said, it happens, I get it, but she doesn't get to blame others for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But just normally sitting in a bathroom closet in a temperature controlled house shouldn't do damage.", "they are not sealed like sterile medical equipment meaning bacteria can get into the packaging eventually.", "The shelf life of tampons is about five years \u2014 provided they're left in the package undisturbed and not exposed to excessive moisture. Tampons are sanitary products, but they're not packaged and sealed as sterile products. This means bacteria and mold can grow if they're not stored properly.", "Hang on I never knew that. Well apparently the expiry  is like 5 years", "Did you carry them when you had periods? Or did you go around expecting other people to give you their emergency stash?", "But if you did need them it would be common sense to be prepared. Like OPs friend should be and OP doesn't have to be.", "I have a feeling they meant common sense for anyone who still has a period", "Key info; you have them bc you 2 daughters and a granddaughter who may need it, OP doesn't have need it in years, and yes while periods are natural (no one argue that) is not OPs responsibility nor obligation to have them in her house", "This is amazing \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "yep, pads make awesome field dressings", "I once waited for an ambulance with a lady who had fallen over and cut her head. I sent her in with a nappy pressed on her head. Cleanest thing I had and absorbant", " I work with Nurses that kind of story is one they will talk about for years!", "Thanks for the laugh \ud83d\ude02", "An RN happened to be on the motorcycle ride in which my partner went down on and she immediately started asking all the women around if any had tampons and started stuffing his opened elbow with them. Doctors later said it actually helped keep a lot of stuff out. You never know when they might come in handy. Especially with brothers in the house who may need them for nosebleeds one day.", "That us understandable. She knows I'm a giggly person, not that that's an excuse, so I didn't think much of it. I mostly chalked it up to being hormonal and a tad embarrassed.", "Female here too - I just never thought to call them expired :)", "Had...no idea \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Oh, I get you now. I thought you were referring to OP! Yes, the friend should have been more prepared. When I did have monthlies, I always had a feminine product in my purse just in case. I don't carry them with me anymore, but I actually do have a box leftover that I keep around in case any of my girlfriends need something.", "But she has girlfriends who come over", "Yep! My husband keeps a couple in his camping kit, one in his 'do you have a kitchen sink in there?' jacket and there's a few in the car first aid kit. Our kiddo suggested putting one in the first aid kit they were building at scouts, got laughed at (grade school boys) and then their retired police officer (and ex-Marine) said \"Great idea; I always have a couple in mine\" ... which led to the TRULY awesome email home to all the parents with the equipment list - including maxipads!   \n\n\nI think a couple parents' brains kinda exploded. My husband just told the kid where the box was, and to take from the one in the main bathroom, not the one under Mom's sink, so that Mom would know how many she had.", "Any port... err paddy thing in a storm!", "her friends are not her dependents. they\u2019re also adults who have periods for almost a decade. they\u2019re responsible for their menstrual needs.", "Yes girl friends, who are in no world her responsibility and for what ops said in comments only 2. Still not her responsibility buy pads an tampons [that are really more expensive that they should] just for that. Like what you do for your family is a good thing but not the standar nor the morally right thing is just something you do and is a nice gesture", "Yeah and those can bring their own tampons while on their period.\nOP offered to go to the store woth her, weich was not good enough. It's not her Responsibility to store hygiene products that she has no use of.", "My husband does D of E expeditions with his school and always has some pds in his first aid kit for both conventional and non conventional use - they're perfect for those not very deep but wide scrape wounds kids get.", "It\u2019s just a courtesy", "I do believe it\u2019s not her responsibility or even that she was wrong, her friend reacted horribly. I was just saying that keeping a small supply is courteous", "I agree it\u2019s not her responsibility just a courtesy", "You can start a fire with tampons. All serious campers carry them.", "Why does her friend not have an emergency supply for HER friends she can tap into?", "but also not her responsibility.", "You seem weirdly invested in the etiquette rules for menstruating women.\n\nYou keep some around for the women in your life, good for you.", "Lol, I have 3 older sisters too"]}
