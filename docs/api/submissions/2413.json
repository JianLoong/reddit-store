Onto the issue. \n\nI have a friend, we'll call her Zaylee (23f) who came over to hang out with me last week. For context, I have the nexplanon birth control bar in my arm. I know it's different for everyone, but for me it completely takes away my period and lasts for 3 years. (This is my second time having itl) We were having a movie day to catch up on life since we haven't seen each other in over a week. During one of the movies she gets up to use the restroom so I scroll through my phone waiting on her return. \n\nWell when she comes back down she asks me where I keep my tampons. I responded I don't keep them in the house since I haven't needed one in years. She then proceeded to ask me for a pad and I kinda just giggled and repeated myself. I'm not sure if it was the giggle or lack of products but she completely flips out on me. \"What kind of woman doesn't keep these things?\" \"As a woman you should always keep them?\" \"What the hell am I supposed to do about my situation?\" \"I've never met someone so thoughtless!\"\n\nI was confused. I didn't take her attitude to heart and told her we can go to the Dollar General around the corner if she needs some and that it's not a big deal. Apparently that wasn't good enough for her. She called me an insensitive bitch who doesn't care about other women (??) and need to learn how to be a better host. She called herself a cab and left shortly after. \n\nI can understand the frustration of not having something you need, but lashing out on me made no sense.

Since you have all brothers living with you, they wouldn\u2019t be using them either, so more reason to not keep unnecessary products in the house taking up space. Your friend is a woman who gets her period, she should know to carry an extra tampon or two around in her bag for situations like this, I mean, come on, she\u2019s 23! This surely isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been somewhere and needed a menstrual product, she should know to keep a spare on her just in case.", "NTA\nYour friend is. You should have countered with, \"what kind of woman doesn't carry their own feminine hygiene products for their own needs?\"", "NTA. Your friend was extremely rude!

I might have a bag of leftover tampons under my bathroom sink for guests, but if I'm ever out and about and realize I need a menstrual product, I just use toilet paper as a liner until I'm able to get home.

And mostly for the laughter.\n\nLook, I get it.  You're free of the damned things and that's nice and you don't live with someone who menstruates so it seems like something you don't need to have on-hand.  It's nice not to even have to think about it.\n\nI'm also on long-term birth control (to deal with medical issues) and haven't had a period in a blissfully long time.  I still keep a pack of pads in my bathroom because though I rarely have guests, plenty of the ones I do have menstruate.  My period was so irregular and *heavy* and awful that I know sometimes you just get caught off-guard even if you're in the habit of always carrying some with you - and I assure you, with periods like that I absolutely was - so I always keep some around in case someone needs them.\n\nHonestly, I think it's not a bad idea for guys to keep a pack of pads stored away in their bathroom, either.  Plenty who have sisters, female friends, and girlfriends over frequently do.\n\nIt's just not that expensive to keep a single package of pads in the bathroom.  If only guests are ever using them, and only when they themselves don't have one on-hand, they last *ages.*\n\nYour friend was probably at least partly embarrassed (so your laughter did not likely help), but that doesn't excuse the level of response she gave you - *especially* once you offered to go get some.  If coming with you was a problem (it can be in these situations!) she could have given you some money and had you go get them alone.  There was no need for the way she spoke to you.  It was rich of her to talk about how you're not prepared when she clearly got caught off-guard and unprepared herself.  \n\nAs I said, it happens, I get it, but she doesn't get to blame others for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What woman doesn\u2019t carry her own tampons or pads??  How thoughtless of her to not consider her own menstrual needs at the age of 23.  She\u2019s been menstruating long enough to know she should carry her own products. \nNo one in the world is required to keep feminine products on hand for guests.  Never heard of such things.  Nice to have a couple pads if you have a lot of women in/out of your house but you have other priorities like raising brothers.  Why would you waste money on items unneeded??   And all women use different products.  A pad from the dollar store is a perfect solution until she can buy her own brand and size.

Can we hit up the store?\u201d  \n\nTotally not an asshole moment for you, even if she may have thought you were laughing at her.", "NTA. This is why I never go anywhere without having at least one tampon in a pocket or in my bag.", "NTA\n\nShe should\u2019ve been better prepared. I may not always predict the correct day but I can tell when it\u2019s coming.", "If OP didn't have any, friend didn't have any, that reaction is still over the top. My girlfriends borrow stuff from me, and if I don't have any, they ask other people and go to the store. If they can't, they ask other people to buy the products. It's not supposed to be a big deal that makes you yell at your friend that she's thoughtless.", "Same, I haven\u2019t used either in over ten years, but I have a supply in the bathroom in case a guest needs them, and I have a few in my drawer at the office along with other emergency supplies. \n\nI probably won\u2019t need them, but my emergency supplies aren\u2019t JUST for me.", "From the title I sort of assumed this would turn out to be a young man in his 20s venturing into the world of casual-but-not-too-casual dating.

I intentionally keep some tampons and pads easily findable in the bathroom cabinet just in case a guest needs something and doesn't want to ask for some reason. And honestly, even if most people don't mind asking, it's just easier for them if it's already easily findable. I also don't really consider bathroom cabinets a particularly private place given that's where most people store extra TP and I sure hope guests just open it to get out more TP if the roll runs out mid-use.\n\nTo be clear, definitely NTA though - no reason she can't just go grab something around the corner as OP suggested.", "I, too, like to live dangerously.", "I take a pill birth control and I also don't carry menstrual products with me because my periods are so light I rarely need them (and when I do my panties are already stained with no blood on the pad later). But my bathrooms are fully stocked with pads with several tampons here and there.", "Just to clarify, nobody should ever use TP as a makeshift tampon. It shreds easily and can leave particles inside your vagina that can lead to infection. In an emergency, makeshift TP pad is the way to go. Not implying that this is what you were saying, just wanted to make sure nobody could misinterpret your statement. \n\nAlso, I use a menstrual cup (and rarely have periods anymore, thanks to my IUD), but I also keep a small box of applicatorless tampons in the bottom of my work backpack, just in case I or any of my coworkers get caught unawares. Definitely not something that should be expected of anyone, but if you can afford it, it's a nice thing to do.", "Very smart. A person or pet can bleed out so fast if the wound is deep enough or in the wrong place (not that there's a right place but you get the idea). Having appropriate and affordable supplies readily available makes a difference.\n\nIt even has a side benefit that these boys won't act like a pad is kryptonite if they see a box of them in someone's bathroom. I would have laughed to see the parent's reaction to the equipment list.", "Yep. My husband had a bad one on vacation and I gave him a tampon. The nurses in the ER were impressed. The other band chaperone moms taught me.", "~~You shouldn\u2019t shove TP up there, but if you fold it into many layers and press it against the opening, it works like a more compact pad that should hold you over until you can get your hands on an actual tampon or pad.~~\n\nSorry I realized I basically gave a long winded explanation of what you were already saying. I skimmed and made an ass of myself.", "I had an early period start the second day I was in a foreign country. Had no local money, wasn't sure if my card would work (it had been been hit and miss the day before), and was too embarrassed to ask my much older friends if they had any spares. There must be a face we make that's part panic, part embarrassment, because another angel asked if I needed a tampon.

Now I too carry extra supplies and small amounts of cash, just in case.", "I keep a mini first aid kit in all my bags and a larger one in my car. Plus period supplies, just in case I or someone else has the need. A couple friends laughed about it until they needed a bandage, Tylenol, or an emergency tampon. Now I'm the medic to my friends.

But hey, I'm prepared!  ;)", "My mom always had a mini kit in her bag with all kinds of medicine. Stomachache? Headache? Sore throat? Diarrhea? Scrape? Rash? No worries, i got you.

I imagine it's wonderful.", "Pretty sure that was a response to the giggle because yes\u2026 that is what middle schoolers giggle about and make other girls insecure about (hence the anger) NTA but it\u2019s not a bad thing to have to be nice for other women.
