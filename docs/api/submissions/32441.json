These people in the comments are bananas. OP didn't imply she is in an abusive home, no need for a go bag, or emergency plan. OP Have a talk with your folks, think about what you want privacy for, and from. Articulate it clearly. If you feel weird asking for something specifically DING! DING!... it's probably not appropriate for a 16 year old, which you know. If the request is appropriate, and measured, and it is articulated clearly, your folks will probably loosen the leash a bit and give you the opportunity to earn more trust. NTA for wanting privacy.", "Any family counselor will tell you that progressive autonomy is imperative for development into a well adjusted and responsible young adult. When parents are over bearing and too controlling young people do not learn how to properly become independent and self reliant. \n\nThe right to privacy and being able to make one\u2019s own choices is an absolute requirement. Without these conditions we end up with adult children who don\u2019t know how to self regulate and self soothe. \n\nYou are absolutely correct to be annoyed. However, this is not close to a situation where you should be considering leaving the house or anything drastic. If your parents know that you\u2019re responsible and can be trusted, they shouldn\u2019t have any reason to not be flexible. Sit down and have a serious conversation about this without getting too upset. Go to a family counselor if you need to.", "I don\u2019t necessarily agree with your parents who appear to be overbearing but, I will state that a lot of young girls get themselves in situations they cannot handle or get out of because critical thinking and long term consequence assessment are still years from being fully developed.\n\nIf they don\u2019t have a valid reason for mistrusting you then NTA for being upset but if you have or are doing things they don\u2019t approve of (whether you or anyone else disagrees) then you would be TA.  \n\nJust be careful, be wary of other people\u2019s motivations and please don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t comfortable with your parents seeing on your phone until they relax.  Most likely they are just trying to protect you even if they are not going about it the right way.  Most likely they are projecting and trying to protect you from making the same mistakes they made at your age.", "NTA. What the hell", "NTA \n\nYour parents need to monitor your phone within reason. That\u2019s just parenting 101. It sucks but it\u2019s normal for a 16 year old to be starting to want more independence.\n\nBut that being said, teenagers should learn lessons about ownership. Your parents should let you buy things and claim ownership over them. Maybe not full privacy rights in terms of phone use, but other things for sure.", "NAH. You\u2019re looking at this from the perspective of a teenager, they\u2019re looking at it from the perspective of a parent. Your parent absolutely has the right to monitor what you\u2019re doing, and sure, you have the right to be upset about it. I know this doesn\u2019t make sense right now, but you should be thankful you have parents who give a shit. This isn\u2019t to say I think they should read every text of yours or anything, but 16-year olds are not ready to be totally autonomous.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They also have an obligation to ensure your safety, including from the internet. That doesn't mean they are necessarily right, but what you present here doesn't mean they are wrong either.\n\nAlso: this is such a trope every sitcom covers this in at least one episode. You hit the age where liberty is understood but aren't old enough to qualify for its burdens. 18 will come fast, for good or I'll.\n\nNAH", "NAH\n\nThe world is a scary place with a lot of predators.  Your parents are trying to keep you safe.  You are a minor.", "Well, you\u2019re still a kid. You\u2019ve got a point her but honestly they\u2019re right that so long as you\u2019re under their roof, they\u2019re entitled to monitor your phone and quite frankly they should be to an extent.\n\nNAH/ESH.", "a parent's right to parent their children generally supersedes the minor's right to property or privacy. I know it sounds silly, but teenagers have literally ruined their lives or died because of things they were doing through their phones. your parents need to look through your phone because your brain is not fully grown and therefore you are not always able to recognize just how bad of a decision you are making.", "NTA NTA\ud83d\udcaf\n\nOf course you need autonomy & privacy as a 16 y o. You won't gain the confidence in yourself to know what is right/wrong for you without freedom to make decisions. \n\nEven wrong ones within safe limits because that's part of learning.\n\nHaving your own possessions & space is a vital part of that & good mental health.\n\nProviding 'a roof' doesn't allow/justify  your parents to lay claim to your things & check your phone just because they feel like it.\n\nDo you have a trusted extended family member or school guidance counselor you can speak with?\n\nDo you have brothers & or sisters?\n\nYou say you love your parents; maybe their strictness is coming from a place of fear but this isn't ok OP, not at all.", "NTA. Start getting your shh\\*t together & be ready to leave at 18, they are unlikely to change no matter how old you get. You might even need to go LC because they sound like the type that will still want to meddle in your life even after you move out.", "NTA. Start making a plan now. If you aren't already, start working a saving money. Make sure you know where all your important documents are (things like birth certificate, social security card, passport, medical records). I would also encourage you to keep a diary to let out your frustrations.\n\nThe truth is, you probably won't be able to change your parents mind on anything. All you can do is make a plan to move out when you are 18 (if you need to at that point you can go low or no contact with your parents) If you plan to go to college start research what kind of scholarships are available to you. You have two years to plan, make the most of it.", "NTA. The new iPhone you bought is entirely yours and your privacy matters. Plus I would recommend moving out when you turn 18, because the situation you\u2019re in is very creepy", "NTA. I am 17. I am glad my parents aren't that overprotective. You bought your phone so they shouldn't be doing jackshit with it! I hate and i mean HATE overprotective parents.", "NTA, what you do is look up a bunch or porn on your phone and google things like \u201cbest dress for prostitution,\u201d and \u201cshould I charge more for blow jobs or hand jobs.\u201d and then let them look through it.", "NTA. Your parents are weird and controlling. I feel really bad for you. I don't really thing there's much you can do.... Check the laws in your state about age and such, maybe you could move in with a family member or something? You may just have to put up with it until you move out.", "Sorry but you\u2019re a child. You can have reasonable privacy but phones and the internet can be dangerous. yTA.", "Info:\nHow do they even have time honestly? \nDo they have any reason to be concerned for your safety (illegal activity, an unsafe partner)?\nDo you pay your cellphone bill?", "Don\u2019t iPhones need a plan that require you to be 18+ to sign for?\n\nWhat are other examples of how they invade privacy? How often are they checking your messages?", "nTA but from a parent of teens perspective.. it\u2019s their job to protect you from things you don\u2019t know about. You deserve privacy yes. But kids have sooooo much to learn. My daughter has a phone and it\u2019s very clear I can and will look at it whenever I want\u2026 rarely I do. Can count on my hand how many times I have in the last few years and it was only if something was going on. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s shit talking, porn, swearing or whatever I am only making sure she\u2019s safe. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f anything else I couldn\u2019t care less.", "Eww, I can't stand those types of parents. Putting a roof over your head is what they're supposed to do by default. Part of the bare minimum of choosing to bring a child into the world. Holding the bare minimum over your head and treating you like you owe them for their choice to have you shows that they're probably shitty humans. \n\nBeing a child doesn't mean you don't have a right to privacy or a right to personal property. \n\nI feel like those types don't see their children as humans, but as property.  They don't deserve to have children.", "NTA\n\nPrivacy is some very important thing, growing up, to get more independent.", "your best bet is to wait until you are old enough to move out before you buy yourself stuff that allows you to gain privacy\n\nThey want to know everything cuz they are having a hard time letting you grow up.\n\nand as you get older it might get worse. Especially when you get old enough to go to College or Uni and move away from them.", "Yeah. That\u2019s about all that can be said without further information.", "Absolutely correct.  OP, you will be acting the same way when you have a teen-aged child.", "NAH, I agree it obviously sucks when your parents go through your messages but they have every right to if you\u2019re under 18. Lots of bad things happen online & through texts and even if you think you\u2019re old enough to understand, they\u2019re just trying to protect you. And they have every right to.", "Let kids make the mistakes their parents made, rotten behaviour and it doesn't prepare them for the real world! If you infantilise your kid they'll never become adults it's as simple as that shit look at my sister for proof of this", "Legally yes, they can lay claim to their things assuming OP is in the US. Parents aren\u2019t required by law to let their kid have a phone at all. You may disagree with their decision but it\u2019s 100% within the law.", "This is an insane comment lmao.", "It is not entirely theirs. They have a guardian, thus they do not \u201cown\u201d anything legally.", "No, it\u2019s just they look over my phone. \nI don\u2019t like it.", "I do pay my cellphone bill.", "I got it off of EBay. It isn\u2019t the Best But my parents unboxed it when I was at school so idk. \n\nThey said they didn\u2019t do anything to it but I don\u2019t know.", "Yes agree totally, you're completely right.\n\nOne of my specialities is as a  therapist, working with kids/young adults.\n\nMy experience  is that unfortunately,  parents/caregivers denying  these things without good reason balanced with compassion  & wisdom rarely ends positively.\n\nThe kids will often go full NC as YA's & may have a lot of other issues to contend with as well.", "True, I can\u2019t argue with that", "In that case absolutely NTA.  Those are the only reasons I can imagine looking over your phone.  You are 16, you own it and pay for it and are safe.  I\u2019m sorry.  Parents don\u2019t need to be authoritarian to be effective.", "Hope you did a factory data reset.  You should when buying online anyway."]}
