We\u2019ll be gone for Christmas this year and the idea is to have a quiet Christmas in a foreign country with just the two of us, our new little family that will hopefully be gaining a new member about 9 months from the honeymoon.\n\nI have a great relationship with my in-laws and they have been beyond generous with us. They paid for a lavish wedding and are just all-around generous and welcoming. My wife has a somewhat strained relationship with her mother and when they spend a lot of time together it usually puts my wife in a negative headspace. Despite this, they spend a lot of time together.\n\nOver lunch today, my MIL found out we would be gone for Christmas and immediately started planning with the rest of the table to join us for part of the trip. My wife agreed that it was a great idea and they all started making plans. Nobody asked me how I felt.\n\nI stayed out of the conversation because I didn\u2019t want to make a scene since there was extended family there. I kept squeezing my wife\u2019s leg and trying to communicate with my eyes that I was uncomfortable but she either ignored me or didn\u2019t realize.\n\nAs soon as we left the restaurant, my wife asked me if I was upset. I told her I was very upset and hurt that nobody thought to ask me about my preference. She told me that it probably wouldn\u2019t pan out anyway and that I was overreacting. I told her she was dismissing me and then she got in her car and drove off without saying goodbye.\n\nI have been home for hours now and she has been in the bedroom intermittently napping. I don't want to make this fight bigger than it already is, but I'm getting increasingly frustrated and hurt that my wife hasn't attempted to make peace or even acknowledged me.\n\nIf they joined us, it would be up to 7 people including siblings and partners. They discussed visiting us for only Christmas Day, but already the MIL is vying for more time. I can feel my honeymoon being chipped away. Not only is this a very different plan than my wife and I had discussed in private, but I'm concerned that my MIL's presence will put my wife in a bad mood. I'm also concerned that I will be in a bad mood because it's not what I want at all. I don't want any bad feelings on my freakin honeymoon!\n\nBesides feeling dismissed, I'm frustrated because the fact that my MIL thinks she is being denied spending Christmas with us means that my wife never communicated that we intend to alternate years and this year belongs to my family. So that's a bigger issue. And the fact that my wife enthusiastically agreed to the plan means that if we tell the in-laws that they are uninvited, it will be clear that I am the reason. I wish my wife would stand up to her mother rather than making me look like the bad guy.\n\nBut is it antiquated to expect that we spend our honeymoon entirely by ourselves? Am I a bad husband if I don't find a way to bend on this? Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: changed \"MIL\" to \"mother\" for accuracy in one place.", "created_utc": 1679871173, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1232qgd/wibta_if_i_dont_let_my_inlaws_join_us_on_our/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I refuse to be doing the deed when everyone is there practically watching. Should I put in the divorce papers now before this insanity goes any farther?\" In fact, go ahead and be the bad guy here and message the whole family that your honeymoon is not a family vacation, you will not have it hijacked and turned into a family vacation and if they can't accept that you and your wife are now starting your lives separate from theirs, then you would rather dissolve the marriage before it gets any longer and deeper than it already is, because you will not stand up to being bullied by family to not be able to enjoy your married life.", "**NTA**\n\nSome of my family invited themselves along on my cousin's honeymoon.

Whether you like it or not, you may need to be the one to tell the in-laws that they will not always get their way.", "Nta.\n\nIt's your honeymoon. I would, next time, the in-laws are discussing this, bringing it up, and saying you do realise this is our honeymoon.", "Dude, run! NTA", "DO NOT start a family until the situation with your wife and in-laws is resolved. You are married to her, not them. Your marriage needs to be both spouses priority or it will not work. Ask me how I know.", "Could you talk to your FIL about this? Maybe he will see the light.", "NTA but you need to sit down and THOROUGHLY discuss with your wife what is an acceptable role for her mother to play in your lives. If her answer isn't VERY GOOD or if she ever falters in following through on it, break up with her. Do not marry her until you are satisfied her mother will respect your boundaries. If you do marry her, do not have kids until mother has CONTINUED to respect boundaries.", "NTA. Die on this hill now or about to have a very difficult time moving forward with the inlaws. You will end up either bring the pushover or regretting allot of things and holding animosity towards your wife. Nip it in the butt now, Best of luck!", "NO you will NOT be TA. If your spouse & parents want to go on your honeymoon, say \"Have a great time!\" and stay home.\n\nIn-laws do not belong on honeymoons, nor any other trip you take.", "Or better yet, make the plans, let wife know when, but not where, as it is a surprise for her!!  No way MIL can come with.", "If you're constantly being treated as unreasonable even when you feel your being reasonable, chances are they are gaslighting you, aka mental abuse and manipulation, I highly recommend getting a therapist to discuss this stuff with so you can recognize when you are vs aren't being unreasonable and actually firmly stand up to it", "If your wife continues with the plan of in laws coming, start referring to the trip as a family holiday.  \n\nAnd start talking about your wife about booking a new honeymoon for next year.  And presumably trying for kids will wait till after the honeymoon.  \n\nI'm probably not the best person for giving advice, I'd be straight out really passive aggressive about this. \n\n Look at all the romantic honeymoon stuff you could be doing... Ooh I wonder do your parents want to do the champagne air balloon ride with us, or the mud wraps in the spa.  Ooh look at this romantic thing they have...", "NTA. But if your wife doesn\u2019t want to fix this then perhaps you should decide not to go on her family trip, because that\u2019s what it will be. Make alternative plans or inform her that if you and she cannot have this honeymoon then you will never have a honeymoon. This is unfortunately a hill to die on. If your wife allows this precedence to be set then it will happen again and again. Also perhaps say that since you and wife are no longer going on your honeymoon plans should be changed to be wherever her and her family are willing to pay to go so you can save your money on a trip of your choosing. I know I sound petty and like I\u2019m suggesting you escalate thing but your wife and her family are really out of line. They need to learn to read the room and realize a honeymoon is for the newlyweds not the in laws.", "NTA it\u2019s just weird that they want to join", "NTA. You should stay home and tell your wife to enjoy her honeymoon with her family.  Also you say the in-laws are beyond generous.  Sometimes generosity is just another form of control.", "NTA. In laws are TA if they really think it would be appropriate to crash the honeymoon. Also your wife kind of sounds like TA too. Maybe skip the honeymoon all together and have a solo post-divorce vacation instead.", "In this context -\n\nTwo is company; three (or more) is a crowd. Avoid at all costs. \n\nNTA", "Why don\u2019t you say smiling: \u201cGuys we love you, but this is our delayed honeymoon, so maybe next trip we take, we\u2019ll do a massive family trip\u201d", "I would suggest that you and your fiancee try surveying say 500 people about whether they'd be upset if their in-laws and extended family decided to come along on their honeymoon without asking them.  \n\nThen the two of you can have an intimate dinner with the zero people who say, cool, I long to have my in-laws on my honeymoon.\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s not the ILs you need to be communicating with though. \n\nYour wife is apparently unable to set any boundaries in place with her mother. That will not change for the duration of your marriage. \n\nWhen you have children, your opinion will be less important than her mother\u2019s. \n\nShe will never say no to her mother. Even when it displeases you. \n\nIs this really the life you want?\n\nThis should be a hill to die on - your lives will be miserable if you don\u2019t get this resolved before the wedding.", "NTA. Your in laws are way out of line inviting themselves on your honeymoon. I would nip this in the bud immediately. \u201cAs this is our HONEYMOON trip, we won\u2019t be accepting any visitors. We\u2019d love to celebrate Christmas with you on (insert date before or after trip).\u201d\n\nYour wife is also way out of line for not seeing that this is a problem and being so inconsiderate of your feelings. \n\nThis is a hill I would die on. Honeymoon is not a family vacation. You best get used to setting firm boundaries with these people because I have a feeling you will need them once wifey is pregnant.", "Honestly tell her you don't want to go if her whole family is coming on your honey moon. She can spend Christmas with them and you can plan a different honeymoon then. NTA.", "NTA\n\nCan you just say at home with your parents instead?\n\nA honeymoon with the in-laws and a wife in a bad mood isn't a honeymoon, but a trip to hell", "Your wife decided your honeymoon, your time to enjoy being a couple and hopefully start to expand your nuclear family, should be an extended family holiday vacation\u2026 without so much as asking your opinion about it.  This is a fundamental betrayal of your wedding vows, you know the part where you are both supposed to \u201cforsake all others\u201d?\n\nI would tell her that I hope her and her family are happy with their vacation, I would be going off to enjoy the holiday on my own and that she would be welcome to join me if and when she remembered where her priorities were supposed to be.  That when she could explain what she did wrong, and why it was wrong, we could discuss how to make things right.  \n\nAbsolutely NTA.  Best of luck in resolving this.", "NTA. People at my work were rather weirded out we went to where my husband's grandparents lived for our honeymoon. BUT I'm the one the brought it up because he hadn't seen them in years and they were in their 80s. It was also a part of the country I'd never seen. We didn't have any set plans. \n\nWhen it all played out it was absolutely amazing to meet them. We hung out with them a few hours a day and did a couple outings over a week, and a couple days we didn't see them at all. \n\nIt's like the opposite, USUALLY a honeymoon is just you and spouse. I was the one who brought up the whole idea. Funny note where grandma and I were alone she said \"Was this really your idea, he said it was, but tell me the truth!\". :). Worked great for us all around but no reason anyone else has to involve family in what is usually private time.", "This! Since there is absolutely nothing romantic about a getaway with *anyone\u2019s* parents, this is now a family vacation. **Your wife let her parents hijack your honeymoon.** You should be celebrating your marriage, not worrying if her parents can hear your adult activities (since the in-laws would *absolutely* want the neighboring room). I\u2019d start looking into couple\u2019s counseling, and individual therapy for her. She needs to find her spine and work on setting boundaries/making decisions as a team. This needs to be done before you have children, because I see a future where they try to convince your wife that you should all live and raise the child(ren) together. \n\nTell your wife that since you\u2019re not having a honeymoon, you\u2019ll be spending the holidays with your family, as previously planned, but that she should go and have a great time.", "Reading through this sub I\u2019m beginning to wonder if anyone discusses anything before committing to a relationship or marriage.", "I recently saw a quote that I really found fitting. \nWhen you marry someone, you are not joining their family nor are they joining yours. You are making a new family. That means your family unit decides what you do and how you are. Whether you join her parents for holidays or not. As you build your family to include children, you (and especially her it seems) need to put your family first\u2026 this shouldn\u2019t be a no brainer but for her\u2026 she needs to choose which family is important the one you both are building or the one she grew up in. I think you need to establish some boundaries with her early in in this or she will stay mindless in her responses with her family. NTA and good luck with overbearing in laws", "Seriously MIL I love you but swinging with my in-laws on my honeymoon isn't my thing\n\nNext time when it isn't a romance centered couples vacation you can come", "How on earth is this gaslighting? She's not listening to him, but that is absolutely not what gaslighting means."]}
