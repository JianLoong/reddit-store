Hell you could go buy them a months worth of groceries and they wouldnt be the wiser for your wealth and inability to pay the rest of their bills. You could claim you and a few friends pooled some resources to get food to help. Trust me anyone under water like you describe would not turn down that sort of aid unless they had intentions of spending the money on other things. ALSO FYI more than likely those nice brand new cars you speak of are not paid for and are either leases or loans. So no they cant just go sell them and buy a good used car. Ive been in a financial cituation before where one of my family members made that moronice remark like i was spending beyond my means but i lost my job not due to my actions and the car was our only one and only expense beyond house bills and cell phones.

So, if you can live with seeing family fail then you do you.  Otherwise, I would at least have a very frank conversation with your brother and tell him what you said here.  Sell as much as he can first, refinance if he can, and try to dig himself out of the hole.  Additionally, if it were me, I would require they attend a few sessions with a Financial Planner to get them on track, with a good spending budget, so you don't have to bail them out in the future.  They have to give you the Financial Planner's phone number and authorize you to call them and verify they actually attended.

My brother was the golden child and I still get the feeling of constant guilt/ I have to help him just because. Making my situation clear would most likely result in them harassing us relentlessly. He can be very insistent when he wants something and my parents would certainly jump on that train and try everything they can to make me help him. It would probably result in no contact at the end or at least a big headache.", "Yes this is what makes YTA. It actually sounds like you're withholding help from your brother in a passive-aggressive manner so that you can force him to say something like \"but your farm is so successful, how can you not afford to help out?\"", "I get your point and I am really torn. I know there is probably more to it then meets the eye, but it does look so so bad! Like they buy the cars every year and they are always in the high priced range (jaguar was the last one) - so if your struggling why not a 'normal' brand? Also cars loose a lot of value in the first year, it doesn't make sense to buy them each and every year. Then there is SIL. She is a trained surgeon, but stopped working. Instead she wants to focus on various Etsy projects or buys all the equipment necessary to open a nail salon - to then toss it. If she works, she quits after a few months. We have unemployed covered where we live but she never makes the necessary steps to receive payments because it is 'below her'. My brother told me she online shops at least 1000 euros per month on clothes. I mean there are so many possibilities to save up the money he needs - but they do not take them. \nNone of that makes sense. The vacations are each worth at least 5k (brother told me) and they usually invite her family along (another 5k). He asked me for money in the same week he told me he would be paying for yet another vacation for them and her family. \n\n\nI don't know if they are lying or crazy or ???? I wouldn't let them go without food - however they stated they want money and not in a pay my bills way but only in a sent me the money way. That whole thing makes me uneasy and feeling bad all around", "Omg it\u2019s brother!!! \n\nOP doesn\u2019t owe her brother anything. Especially after years of belittling her life. No one owes anyone anything. One can ask and one can decline. Fair is fair.", "OP is not the AH.

It's a better option to get them in the direction where they'll be able to help themselves out in the future. \n\nNTA", "i can\u2019t give you the actual award - but there was an audible cackle on my end when i read this comment. bravo!", "Extrude?", "Their inability/unwillingness to properly handle the money they have is not your responsibility.\n\nJust because you can, doesn't mean you should.", "NTA\n\nThey have financial options to solve this problem themselves. They are letting their pride, or their own image of themselves, get in the way of those solutions. Getting free money from you is *easy,* for them. They just don't like the options that aren't as easy. They don't want to change, but they need to. \n\nYou would actually be doing them a disservice if you gave them money at this juncture. Don't enable them. They need this learning moment. Hopefully they make something out of it. Either way, the outcome is not your responsibility.", "NTA. They made their bed, they can lie in it.", "NTA This is a problem of their own making and one they could get out of very easily. What they need is some firm advice, not money.", "NTA\n\nHe made his bed, he should lay in it.  It might be different if he or his wife were drowning in medical bills.  Don't help him, not now, not ever.", "You can't pull someone out of a hole while they're still digging. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou're allowed to not rescue your stuck up brother from his poor decisions. \n\nAlso, he has to drop the trophy family lifestyle his wallet can't handle it.", "**NTA**. Can't talk shit and then demand help. Shouldn't have looked down on your husband.\n\n>SIL has a bit of a spending problem\n\nShe should manage that herself.\n\n \n\n>Due to excessive spending, they are financially in trouble.\n\nYes. They are.\n\nA bit of advice: **fuck them.**\n\nBut also: in this market, they'd probably get even more than they spent on those cars. Used car market is *nuts*. They also have those rental properties, businesses, etc. There are plenty of ways they can keep their house. **But their own bad behavior is going to fuck them over, no matter what, if they keep getting bailed out**. You will just end up being used as his secondary wallet, forever. If you don't put your foot down *now*, you gotta do it *sometime*.\n\nBy the way: the fact that their behavior's going to doom them is not a condemnation of everybody in this situation. This is me judging *their* specific behavior. They need to learn not to spend outside of their limits; they need to learn that there are ways that they can get out of this, fairly easily (bankruptcy); I don't know the specifics for this case. IANAL. They'd have to talk to a lawyer. Based on what I've encountered, though, in a bankruptcy, I don't think they'd lose their house, especially if *that's all they got,* and it'd make them homeless. They will also probably be able to keep at least one of the cars.\n\nAlso, as someone who *lived* through *multiple* foreclosures on my childhood home? You have options. Lots and lots and *lots* of options. Assuming that they're not lying (your brother's lying to you; sorry), how far are they behind in their mortgage? Is it, 'not gonna be able to make the payment this month'? That's not... losing your house. That takes time.   \n I *think* it's like 3-4 missed payments. You shouldn't fuck around and make late payments, but-- you don't get your house *yoinked* out from under you, for one or even just two late payments. It takes *work* to be so late that they start trying to take your damn house.\n\nBut then, it gets worse, because-- if they're so far behind in their mortgage that foreclosure is *happening*\\-- ***then why the fuck were they buying all this new, shiny shit, and taking all those vacations?***\n\nYou can save them if you want. If it were my brother, I'd have a nearly-impossible time saying *no*. But, no matter what you do--- and he won't listen, I know-- but you have to tell him, *your spending habits are fucking stupid. I'm happy to help if you get in a real situation, but you got yourself in this situation and it will keep on fucking happening if you don't smarten up about it.*\n\nIt sucks. I know you can't say that.\n\nOh well. Good luck to you. Sorry about him.", "\"we could pay off their home and cars and it wouldn't even put a dent in our financial situation. \"\n\nI agree with the comments of you don't have to, its your money, but given that you can easily afford to help,  which makes me say this....\n\nwhat about telling them to ask your husband as he has all the money?\nJust a thoughtt", "NTA for not giving them money, but you don't have to lie about it. You're not obligated to help anyone, especially someone who had made snide remarks about your husband and your livelihood and whose financial troubles are their own doing. \n\nPerhaps you could suggest they sell those cars or even file for bankruptcy. That would probably benefit them more in the long run than a cash handout would.", "NTA, never loan money to family it\u2019s hard to get it back and it\u2019s hard to ask for it back without sounding like a B!", "NTA.  Don\u2019t ever bail out financially irresponsible people.  They\u2019ll just keep coming back for more money.  They can figure this out on their own.  They aren\u2019t destitute.   There are they can sell, they can get a second job, etc.", "Giving them money means they won't LEARN anything. Keep your money.", "So I'm reading these comments and it suddenly struck me.  Tell him you can't give him any money but if he needs extra, he can come work at the \"cute little farm\" to earn some extra.  He surely can't use the excuse that he can't take the time off since he takes five vacations a year . . .\n\nYeah, I know he'd never take you up on that because it's \"beneath him\" but his reaction might be really entertaining.", "NTA: Brother will just misspend it. Rent/Mortgage comes first so your kid has a roof over their heads, as they don't care about new cars every year (!).\n\nPlus, maybe have somebody help with the paperwork your husband hates doing? It may eat into profits, but my grandparents did it with their businesses and it made their lives a lot easier.", "Exactly this. It sounds like they don\u2019t want to adjust their own lifestyle to accommodate their changing situation. I\u2019m worried they\u2019d learn nothing if you were to help them, so all the more reason not to. You aren\u2019t obligated here at all.
