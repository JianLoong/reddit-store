Hell you could go buy them a months worth of groceries and they wouldnt be the wiser for your wealth and inability to pay the rest of their bills. You could claim you and a few friends pooled some resources to get food to help. Trust me anyone under water like you describe would not turn down that sort of aid unless they had intentions of spending the money on other things. ALSO FYI more than likely those nice brand new cars you speak of are not paid for and are either leases or loans. So no they cant just go sell them and buy a good used car. Ive been in a financial cituation before where one of my family members made that moronice remark like i was spending beyond my means but i lost my job not due to my actions and the car was our only one and only expense beyond house bills and cell phones.

So, if you can live with seeing family fail then you do you.  Otherwise, I would at least have a very frank conversation with your brother and tell him what you said here.  Sell as much as he can first, refinance if he can, and try to dig himself out of the hole.  Additionally, if it were me, I would require they attend a few sessions with a Financial Planner to get them on track, with a good spending budget, so you don't have to bail them out in the future.  They have to give you the Financial Planner's phone number and authorize you to call them and verify they actually attended.

My brother was the golden child and I still get the feeling of constant guilt/ I have to help him just because. Making my situation clear would most likely result in them harassing us relentlessly. He can be very insistent when he wants something and my parents would certainly jump on that train and try everything they can to make me help him. It would probably result in no contact at the end or at least a big headache.", "Yes this is what makes YTA. It actually sounds like you're withholding help from your brother in a passive-aggressive manner so that you can force him to say something like \"but your farm is so successful, how can you not afford to help out?\"", "I get your point and I am really torn. I know there is probably more to it then meets the eye, but it does look so so bad! Like they buy the cars every year and they are always in the high priced range (jaguar was the last one) - so if your struggling why not a 'normal' brand? Also cars loose a lot of value in the first year, it doesn't make sense to buy them each and every year. Then there is SIL. She is a trained surgeon, but stopped working. Instead she wants to focus on various Etsy projects or buys all the equipment necessary to open a nail salon - to then toss it. If she works, she quits after a few months. We have unemployed covered where we live but she never makes the necessary steps to receive payments because it is 'below her'. My brother told me she online shops at least 1000 euros per month on clothes. I mean there are so many possibilities to save up the money he needs - but they do not take them. \nNone of that makes sense. The vacations are each worth at least 5k (brother told me) and they usually invite her family along (another 5k). He asked me for money in the same week he told me he would be paying for yet another vacation for them and her family. \n\n\nI don't know if they are lying or crazy or ???? I wouldn't let them go without food - however they stated they want money and not in a pay my bills way but only in a sent me the money way. That whole thing makes me uneasy and feeling bad all around", "Omg it\u2019s brother!!! \n\nOP doesn\u2019t owe her brother anything. Especially after years of belittling her life. No one owes anyone anything. One can ask and one can decline. Fair is fair.", "OP is not the AH.

You and your husband are not their personal bank. Maybe you should have told him straight to his face that you didn\u2019t want to help him, even though we all know that\u2019d cause problems. He was able to get himself into this mess, he\u2019s able to get himself out of it. Maybe it\u2019ll finally teach them a lesson. \n\nNTA", "Look am not sure if it might help but if u feel bad BTW not helping them maybe u can give them a loan, like legally known loan,with a fixed time to get back ur money. if they don't return ur money then u take away something or go to court. Idk something like that anyways.", "There you go\u2026 tell him to go ask mom and dad then. He sounds exhausting and entitled.", "Maybe going LC is the way to go then...", "That\u2019s where you might have to decide if they are really worth keeping in your life. It\u2019s sad that you are debating being honest about your life with your family, knowing that if you help it will bote you in the butt.\n\n\nIf he is the golden child, condescending to your husband who works hard, spends money they don\u2019t have, with your SIL who is a surgeon and doesn\u2019t want to work (aka playing stupid games), they deserves the stupid prizes. Help if you do it for you, but be very explicit that there is no 2nd, 3rd, 4th or any other time. \n\nI still think his surgeon wife should work to clear their debts and they should learn to live within their means. Not lifestyles of the rich (in this case very poor) and famous (well not famous at all).\n\nNTA", "NTA I would not buy the house. That is a recipe for disaster. \n\nI will be quite honest with you it seems your brother and sil have realized your financial situation already. It seems strange that he is coming to you now for help. Makes me wonder if he has figured it out and now they both want a free ride and are taking advantage of you. \n\nBe very careful on how you handle this situation. Don\u2019t ever loan money to family unless your willing to loose it. Also if you loan them money now it will always be needing money for other things. You will become their  personal atm.", "Well, yes, you evict your brother, if they don\u2018t pay. Or you sell the house to one of those investment companies, who seem to love to things like this. He wants your help, he gets it. He spits in your face, he gets to enjoy the consequences. Are you sure he doesn\u2019t know about your financial situation? Maybe family or friends told them.", "Don\u2019t listen to these Y T A people. Your brother sounds both entitled and financially irresponsible. If you start helping him, it\u2019s not going to stop. You are NTA and enjoy the farm life. It honestly sounds like an awesome life. \ud83d\ude00", "Here's the thing, though. In your original post you said that you don't want to help because of the way that your brother treated your husband and because they look down on others. Now you're offering different reasoning. You realize that changing the rationale for your actions is evidence of bad faith, right?\n\nAs to the feared relentless harassment, you can stop that by blocking them. If your parents get involved, you can tell them to take care of your brother's family, and you can block them if they harass you. \n\nI get it\u2014everyone is the hero of their own story and wants to be seen as wearing the white hat. But my judgment stands.", "Yea it sounds like the sort of relationship i had with my ex wife allright. Never happy without going going going and new stuff all the time. My only saving grace was she never quite her job to do weird stuff. But she certainly tried out 47 crafts that invovled set up each time during our marrige along with buying a new pet every 3 weeks only to give it up for \"reasons\" a week or so later. Your brother has expectations on himself and she does as well. It really sounds like their basically planning on bankruptsy? is that a option in your country? i dunno. I know here a huge number of people that do it will do this very thing. just keep the vacations and nice cars coming until its not feasable then file for chapter 13, maybe keep the house and let everything else go. OR he's just a moron and thinks he will always come up with what he needs when he needs and doesnt see the hole he's digging. But i can tell you with full advice never give him cash for anything. He will bring you down with him", "He is, in a roundabout way, asking you to pay for his in-laws vacations and his wife\u2019s wardrobe.  I suspect he has duped his wife and family into thinking he is very wealthy, but the moment of truth is at hand.  \n\nSomeone who is truly needy would not turn down help with the groceries and electric bills.  This is super sketchy, so be cautious."]}
