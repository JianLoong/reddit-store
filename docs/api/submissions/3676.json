Hell you could go buy them a months worth of groceries and they wouldnt be the wiser for your wealth and inability to pay the rest of their bills. You could claim you and a few friends pooled some resources to get food to help. Trust me anyone under water like you describe would not turn down that sort of aid unless they had intentions of spending the money on other things. ALSO FYI more than likely those nice brand new cars you speak of are not paid for and are either leases or loans. So no they cant just go sell them and buy a good used car. Ive been in a financial cituation before where one of my family members made that moronice remark like i was spending beyond my means but i lost my job not due to my actions and the car was our only one and only expense beyond house bills and cell phones.

So, if you can live with seeing family fail then you do you.  Otherwise, I would at least have a very frank conversation with your brother and tell him what you said here.  Sell as much as he can first, refinance if he can, and try to dig himself out of the hole.  Additionally, if it were me, I would require they attend a few sessions with a Financial Planner to get them on track, with a good spending budget, so you don't have to bail them out in the future.  They have to give you the Financial Planner's phone number and authorize you to call them and verify they actually attended.

My brother was the golden child and I still get the feeling of constant guilt/ I have to help him just because. Making my situation clear would most likely result in them harassing us relentlessly. He can be very insistent when he wants something and my parents would certainly jump on that train and try everything they can to make me help him. It would probably result in no contact at the end or at least a big headache.", "Yes this is what makes YTA. It actually sounds like you're withholding help from your brother in a passive-aggressive manner so that you can force him to say something like \"but your farm is so successful, how can you not afford to help out?\"", "I get your point and I am really torn. I know there is probably more to it then meets the eye, but it does look so so bad! Like they buy the cars every year and they are always in the high priced range (jaguar was the last one) - so if your struggling why not a 'normal' brand? Also cars loose a lot of value in the first year, it doesn't make sense to buy them each and every year. Then there is SIL. She is a trained surgeon, but stopped working. Instead she wants to focus on various Etsy projects or buys all the equipment necessary to open a nail salon - to then toss it. If she works, she quits after a few months. We have unemployed covered where we live but she never makes the necessary steps to receive payments because it is 'below her'. My brother told me she online shops at least 1000 euros per month on clothes. I mean there are so many possibilities to save up the money he needs - but they do not take them. \nNone of that makes sense. The vacations are each worth at least 5k (brother told me) and they usually invite her family along (another 5k). He asked me for money in the same week he told me he would be paying for yet another vacation for them and her family. \n\n\nI don't know if they are lying or crazy or ???? I wouldn't let them go without food - however they stated they want money and not in a pay my bills way but only in a sent me the money way. That whole thing makes me uneasy and feeling bad all around", "Omg it\u2019s brother!!! \n\nOP doesn\u2019t owe her brother anything. Especially after years of belittling her life. No one owes anyone anything. One can ask and one can decline. Fair is fair.", "OP is not the AH.

No no no", "if you let them know there is money, there will either be no more peace or no more money...honestly not sure you wouldn't be wisest to dial wayyyyy back on even the \"once a year for the holidays\" contact!", "And that\u2019s why you are in a better financial situation than your brother. Keep living your best life and let your brother deal with the fallout of his bad choices.", "You are NTA. Hire him a financial advisor and tell him that\u2019s all you can do. You\u2019ve stated he refuses to down size or get less expensive cars then he\u2019s not asking for real help. He just wants to be bailed out till the next time. \n\nShe\u2019s capable of working if she doesn\u2019t want her family to do hungry. Let them keep looking down on you. You do not owe them anything. It\u2019s not like they tragically lost their jobs. They want to act rich and they\u2019re broke.", "No they bought a jaguar while he struggling. It is not your responsibility to manage his and his wife clearly horrific spending habits. If you open that door of assistance that you have that type of money it will never end. I guarantee they will see your money as their money", "People who overspend like this tend to have a bigger house of cards than anyone around them realizes. But they are also incredibly good at keeping the game going. Your brother is testing to see if you can be used as a chip.\n\nConfidently and proudly deny him with no information he can use against you. Your niece will not be homeless, your brother will just have to rent if the house goes. Your SIL seems perfectly capable of making sure the living conditions will be nice.\n\nIf you feel even an ickling of guilt, remember he will actually use your money to sustain the Jags, not basic life necessities. NTA", "Yea, I can understand that. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t vote as y t a when you\u2019re title was specifically asking about the lying part, even though I\u2019m a person who believes that lying in an AH move\u2026 in your situation I figured there was some more detailed reason why the lie was better. \n\nI still don\u2019t agree with lying, but no you shouldn\u2019t give him the money and keeping your money doesn\u2019t make you an AH. You need to do what you feel is right for you.", "You are NTA \n\nI suspect they found out your farm wasn\u2019t so little and hope to squeeze some cash from you.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like they are any way near to \u201closing their home\u201d if they have 2 overly expensive vehicles and 5 holidays per year. It does sound like they want you to finance their indulgent lifestyle.\n\nDont worry about this, but don\u2019t lower your to lie about your life, you don\u2019t owe him anything even if you are a millionaire. Next time he pleads poverty suggest selling the cars and cut the holiday to one modest one per year until their finances improves.", "This is such a nice, succinct and really ACCURATE framing of what\u2019s going on.   I really hope OP reads it.", "Yes, they absolutely are and your right, they are in this together. I feel bad for my niece but then again their second car is new enough that they could just give it back and then would have enough money (worth more then he asked for). It seems as if they need to learn the hard way that things have to change", "Agreed, also once that \"bank\" opens, they'll drain you for as much as they can, since 'the way you live you don't really need it anyway' or whatever crazy justification makes continuing to overspend okay in their mind.\n\nYou are right, they can trim a few parts of their lifestyle and be okay. (Depending on where you are and what you want to do, you might want to have a college fund of some kind for the niece, depending on what kind of young adult she turns out to be, since I doubt her parents are taking care of her future very well)", "Great point!", "He didn't say loan and I doubt he meant loan. He asked for money. Based on past behaviour he wouldn't pay it back", "We both try to be responsible and don't have expensive taste. Like good is enough I don't need the best taste. And yes, I know it sounds petty but I really don't like them looking down on him. He is very clever yet hardworking, handy and cares a lot about family and also his workers. Last time my brother was visiting he made a comment about how I shouldn't socialise with our workers because they are so 'simple' and I 'should know better'. These are very hardworking people with good hearts who literally work for my families living - I was so disappointed in my brother for his view on them", "That is what they did last year. Changed their arrangement from paying off the home to paying only interests ...", "Mom and dad are ... Not really in a situation to help - HOWEVER they already gave them money a few times and I know that at least one payment was used for vacation. My parents are immigrants and never have been on vacation themselves but are kind of in denial about it all. My dad told me that my sil, as a surgeon, must have had good reason to use the money for a vacation and it is not my place to question her. My parents themselve live extremely frugally with eating as cheap as possible and heating in winter set to 16degrees Celsius (( 60 in Fahrenheit according to Google))", "Read it :) thanks for reminding me", "Nta just let him know unfortunately your little farm doesn\u2019t leave room to help with that type of assistance", "I didn\u2019t say loan. But yeah, don\u2019t give him any money. Just because you could afford to do it doesn\u2019t mean you have to.", "DEFINITELY DO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY", "Yes, sir!"]}
