My husband and I had a similar thing happen after having our baby. my husband also didn\u2019t want to go to counseling but we found one online so we could just call with them. It started slowly with me sharing what I learned in therapy and how it benefited me.once we started therapy things changed for the better. We were able to work on our communication differences and understand how big a change adding a kid is. Could your husband be depressed? \n\nI would speak to your therapist about how to approach it but I would recommend what my therapist told me. Once he\u2019s home from work the division of labor is equal. So that means chores, childcare, etc. Come up with a set plan. You cook every other day, he cooks the others. Whoever doesn\u2019t cook loads the dishwasher. \nSame with dividing time for yourself. My husband would sit and play video games for literally hours. So my therapist had me track. He plays for four hours? I get four hours to do whatever I want. That way I wasn\u2019t trying to limit his free time, I was just evening the playing field. \n\nWhile I never told my husband that \u201cwe are now roommates\u201d I did tell him it felt like we were. Regular date nights, couples counseling and communicating have saved our marriage. \nI would sit him down when there are no distractions and express how you have been feeling lately. Honestly I\u2019d ask him to look around (at all the junk he leaves out and messes he makes) and ask if he would want a roommate like himself? If the answer is no, then ask him what he\u2019s going to do about it and how you can support him as he works on it. If the answer is yes then say \u201cwe have different standards of cleanliness that we are okay living with. We need to meet in the middle\u201d and write up a game plan. \n\nRemember you\u2019re on the same team. It\u2019s not you vs him. It\u2019s you together against everything that could attack your relationship. \n\nBest of luck! Please let me know if I can offer any more help. I lived this same thing about a year ago.

Perhaps seeking therapy might help?", "ESH, except obviously the baby. While it's certainly an innovative way of dealing with the problems at hand, it's not the right way to go about it. I doubt it would make him change, either. A better way of dealing with it is for you to leave for a few days. If you don't have family nearby or you don't want to impose on them, go to a hotel. Tell him, \"You're obviously not capable of being a good husband or father right now, so the baby and I will go stay somewhere else until you can get into a better place. Just let me know when you're ready to share the responsibilities of having a family, and I'll come home.\"\n\nIf he doesn't call you within a few days, then perhaps at the one week mark you can meet him in a public place that offers some privacy like a park and talk about where things stand. Tell him in no uncertain terms what you expect of him. He needs to pull his weight, and he does sound depressed. Men often will not admit to being depressed because they don't want to be seen as weak. Ironically, the weakness is in *not* admitting it, rather than admitting it and getting help.", "Very difficult, I won't say if either of you are TA as your situation is probably different from both of your perspectives.\n\nYoung couples that have babies are most at risk of splitting up. Your relationship has gone from you two being each others world, to your baby being your world and your husband left on the outskirts. I know why this happens but its difficult to accept and deal with, and it feels like it will never end.\n\nMy wife actually chatted about this yesterday with her friends, they agreed that for the first year after birth, the wife hates on the husband for at least a year. It's hormonal, it's a primal thing and there isn't anything you can do about it. You have baby brain and your instincts are telling you that you can fend for yourself with the little one. But at the same time you won't realise any of the behaviours your exhibiting to your husband. Now bear with me, I'm not wife bashing..\n\nYour husband should be trying to support you as best he can, by doing the cleaning and housework, cooking food, looking after the baby for a few hours so you can sleep. If he isn't, then he probably doesn't realise that the situation at the moment is because of your hormones and it is temporary. He probably feels neglected and overworked, and is acting immaturely to the situation.\n\nYour both very young and I think this will play a massive factor in what is going on and both of your reactions. Awareness of how a new baby changes the dynamic of a relationship is key, and communication. Do some research on this and speak to your husband. Don't relegate him to room mate, you'll mate the situation far worse, do you want him to start questioning why he is there? Try give him some attention, make him feel wanted and part of the family.\n\nI have to say though, him laughing at you is a big red flag. Its impossible to know what's actually going on in your house but mocking a difficult situation is never a good sign.", "This is amazing. Thank you so much. The video game thing is so relatable. The days after she was born he quickly clocked over 100 hours online. He thinks it\u2019s hilarious. \n\nThere are days when it seems better and then days that he is so mean to me. We have talked with a therapist and we have had conversations about dividing tasks but it never lasts.

I\u2019m glad to hear it got better for you guys.", "This. Everyone gets a therapy!", "Yes, he says he doesn\u2019t have time.

I have indeed communicated my struggles and feelings to him. I do think he is suffering from depression and I have brought this up as well but he tells me he is fine.

I am not saying that I\u2019m perfect, but i have certainly opened the conversation up to asking what i can do to make him feel loved or help him with and he always tells me that there is nothing.", "Then NTA.", "He's laughing at you crying! That's not depression. That's him being an ass.\n\nEdit: He could be depressed. But that doesn't mean you suffer coz of it. He's not willing to go to therapy. And you can't force him. He has to be willing to get help. That's on him. You have your own mental health issues and are actively trying to fix them. You can't be expected to carry your weight and his.

And then, when he's there, I usually let him lead. \n\nAnd he's brought up issues that honestly, I see, and bother me too, but I wouldn't have thought to mention them in therapy... I get to hear what's important to him, we get to work on/work through things together, and he's now more comfortable and less scared, about seeking individual therapy for himself. \n\nSo I don't know if that something your therapist is willing to do... But it's helped us SO MUCH.", "Unfortunately people handle their emotions very differently and, a lot of the men I know who suffered or currently suffer from depression, will always say they are fine. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s pride or the stigma of male emotionality.\n\nGiving up housekeeping is usually a sign the depression is really bad, it signals he has lost care for even the small things he can do at home. \n\nso then, you\u2019re NTA, at all I should clarify. You did what you could do. The problem is he\u2019s also NTA at this point because he\u2019s depressed. \n\nThe fear of getting help, being diagnosed and it being real, something is \u201cwrong with him\u201d can be a crippling fear and prevents a lot of people from going to get help or treatment. \n\nIf anything you will have to try to talk to him again, and absolutely do not do what you proposed in your post, that would likely be the absolute worst thing you could do at this point of time.", "As I said, I don't fully know what's going on in your house. Has he always been like this? If yes has them maybe the baby has just brought existing problems to the surface and made them worse. I was talking from my own experience and that of friends and family. If his behaviour has changed then maybe ask him why, don't argue, just listen to him. As I said before, the first year after a child is VERY difficult.", "I think he is TA if he's depressed and doesn't do anything especially considering he has an infant and a wife with PPD. Mental health issues aren't your fault but they are your responsibility.\n\nOP you've done enough, you don't have to try to talk again. You've tried that.

Stopping doing things for him of course she should be doing, but telling him she\u2019s done \u201cdoing the wife stuff\u201d isn\u2019t going to help and would be an A move. \n\nYes she needs to be dealing with her ppd and not raising him, but that is going to exacerbate the emotional turmoil of both of them.\n\nA different solution is needed.", "Yeah truthfully this is a tricky situation.

I literally couldn't wrap my head around the fact that I was behaving differently than before. \n\nSorry to burst your bubble, but mental illness isn't the cute little illness that's portrayed on movies, tv, and social media.

Are you an expert on what is and isn't a symptom of PPD? Are you qualified to diagnose it? Are you qualified to say this behavior is caused by PPD and not by another mental illness?  Or are you a layman who is trying to speak as an authority on a subject they have no right to speak on? That's what dangerous.", "Your comments are a mirror of this comment section but alright"]}
