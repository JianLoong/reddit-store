Almost every day. Apparently he also has to babysit his brother a lot, because he brings the kid with him 2-3 times a week. This kid is ten or eleven.\n\nMy son and his boyfriend are usually doing their own thing, and the kid is just wandering around my house. It's not like I think the kid is going to do anything necessarily, but he looks bored as hell, and I feel bad for him. It's distracting. Sometimes he wanders by my office and asks me what I'm doing, and I try to be nice, but I'm working. (Well, sometimes I'm on Reddit. Usually I'm working.)\n\nIt's even worse on weekends. Sometimes I leave to go see my girlfriend around midmorning and the kid is lounging in my living room. I get back in the early evening, and he's still there. So I told my son that I don't like this. I asked him to talk to his boyfriend about bringing his brother over less.\n\nWell, my son didn't like this. He said I just didn't like his boyfriend and was trying to come up with a roundabout way to kick him out of the house. That's not true. I just feel sorry for this kid. Doesn't he have any friends he could hang out with? Surely there's a compromise here. But my son thinks I'm being a bigoted asshole.\n\nInfo I got from talking to son: No, the parents of the boyfriend don't know he's bi, and he doesn't want them to know. So I'm not going to mention that if I talk to them. Apparently the little brother is special needs and can't be left alone. I was initially highly skeptical of this, as I have interacted with this child and saw no signs of this, but I also can't think of a reason to lie about that. So that's why he's frequently bringing his brother over, because the little kid can't be home alone, and sometimes the parents are out of the house.\n\nWell he basically is alone here, because no one is watching him. So I put my foot down and said if the boyfriend brings his brother over, he and my son have to watch him, and if they don't, boyfriend has to leave. Son is mad at me, but he says he will comply. So we'll see how that goes.", "created_utc": 1670425501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf3bvj/aita_for_wanting_my_sons_boyfriend_to_stop/", "score": 1299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son is violating boundaries-- you're the parent, you can make the rules.

This is about not having an extra child wandering about the house. If he needs proof, then have the bf come without the brother, as you're asking, and see how you respond.  I would add that effectively, I'm unwittingly being left as the responsible adult in charge of this child and I am unwilling to accept that.

You really need to keep talking to your son about this. You don't have a problem with the boyfriend being over there. That's fine, but the brother shouldn't be.

It may very well be something you need to report to CPS. He did not make the decision to become a parent, their parents did. This is WAY more than just sometimes parents are gone, they are deliberately leaving a disabled child with someone who is still a child himself, and making him raise him. It could also be that the younger brother may not be safe at home alone with their parents parents. \n\nAs stated, I'm not trying to get you to allow the younger brother over, only trying to give perspective to see if there are any other actions, such as reporting to CPS, that may need to be taken.
