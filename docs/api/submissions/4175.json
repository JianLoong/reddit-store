Your son is violating boundaries-- you're the parent, you can make the rules.

I have a no closed doors rule at my house. If he's supposed to be babysitting, he needs to be at home babysitting.

This is about not having an extra child wandering about the house. If he needs proof, then have the bf come without the brother, as you're asking, and see how you respond.  I would add that effectively, I'm unwittingly being left as the responsible adult in charge of this child and I am unwilling to accept that.

Like other have written, I also worry when a young couple spend that much time alone, closed doors.  Your house is not a Crash Pad For Everything Goes; you have a right to be respected in your own home.  I'm not saying the bf and your son should be entertaining with you 24/7, of course not.
