When we started talking about marriage a few years ago, we both agreed that we wanted an intimate wedding since we are both on the introverted side. We initially wanted to do a small wedding aboard, but because of the pandemic and his mother's health, we decided against it. We found a small venue and we are paying for everything ourselves. \n\nLast November, I sent out save the dates. My (F28) cousin who is also a bridesmaid, called me letting me know that she received the invitation and that she let everyone know about the wedding. At first, I corrected her and let her know I sent her a save the date (there was no information about the venue or times, just the date and the city and state the wedding was going to be at) and I figured she was just excited since she has never been in a wedding before. She started asking me about how many people she could bring, and I let her know because of costs and the size of the venue, she was only going to be able to bring her father, sister, and her long-term boyfriend.\n\nShe started freaking out that she had invited a lot of people to my wedding and now she had to tell them that they couldn't come and how that was embarrassing for her. I told her she never asked to invite people to my wedding and I didn't want people that I didn't know to be there. \n\nTwo minutes after she hung up, she called me back and gave me an ultimatum- I allow her to bring her boyfriend's mother (who I haven't met before and does not live with my cousin) or she was not going to be in my wedding. I told her firmly, \"I'm sorry you feel that way but that cannot be done. I'm sorry to hear that you don't want to be in the wedding anymore but I can't budge on this.\" I hung up the phone.\n\nAfter not speaking to her for a few months, I saw her yesterday at a family gathering, but she made it a point not to engage with me at all. I decided to text her after the gathering letting her know that I was sorry to miss her earlier but I wanted her to know the invitation was going to be sent next week.She asked again about her boyfriend's mother. I let her know again that was not possible, but depending on how many people RSVP,  I could see about the mom but I was not going to make any promises. She replied back, saying that her and her family talked and they decided that they did not want to come because I insulted her family by not allowing the boyfriend's mom to come. \n\nMy sister and my mom think I should still send the invite to them,(They think that if I don't invite them they are going to cause more drama) but my fianc\u00e9 does not. I'm torn and hurt because I love my cousins and want them to be there but after the ultimatum she gave me and her not listening to my reasons why her boyfriend's mom can't come as well as inviting people without consulting me, I'm leaning more towards to revoking her invitation.

Who the hell invites people to someone else's wedding?! She's way out of line, and she's treating you really terribly. I would uninvite her too. You don't need to deal with her tantrums at your wedding.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding. I\u2019m siding with fianc\u00e9, on this one. You may love your cousins but she showed some true colors that aren\u2019t ok, imo. I wouldn\u2019t want someone that entitled around me. I think it\u2019s pretty common knowledge that you can\u2019t invite people to an event that isn\u2019t yours\u2014 then complain and throw ultimatums around when you can\u2019t get your way.  \n\nIf you send the invite, you can run the risk of her coming with uninvited guest, anyway\u2014 or she just ignores it.   If you don\u2019t send it, you might sour the relationship further, but she certainly doesn\u2019t need one, with how she\u2019s acting.", "NTA\n\nIf you invite her, she's totally going to show up with boyfriend's mom and demand a showdown. Or be making passive aggressive comments all night. Or do something else to undermine the day.  She *might* not show, but I wouldn't leave that door open even a tiny crack. \n\nWho on earth invites guests to a wedding without checking with the couple? That's so bizarre.  \n\nYou were more gracious than you had to be in your last interaction and you can truly say you did what you could to salvage it.", "Nta. Who sees a save the date and tells everyone around? Does she not know how to live in society? And WHY is her boyfriends mom so freaking important you haven\u2019t even met her", "NTA. A wedding is not open for everyone, there\u2019s a reason why people send out invitations. You did invite her immediate family and her bf so she is being unreasonable", "NTA \n\nOMG the audacity. Your cousin is an AH for thinking she can invite people to your wedding.", "I wouldn\u2019t invite her as she\u2019s already declined and snubbed you at a family event but she has no right to do so on behalf of her father or sister. Why not speak to them both first before sending out the invitations and let them know what she said? And, no, her boyfriend\u2019s mother whom you\u2019ve never even met isn\u2019t invited, neither is that lady\u2019s inevitable plus one.\n\nNTA but your cousin is", "NTA and this is absolutely insane. She wants her boyfriend\u2019s mom to come to her own cousin\u2019s wedding, who BF\u2019s mom has NEVER MET? What a ridiculous hill to die on", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that you don\u2019t invite people to someone\u2019s wedding without prior permission - her giving you an ultimatum was over the line. It\u2019s not her event, it\u2019s not about it, and it\u2019s certainly not about her boyfriends mother.", "She's being absolutely ridiculous and over the top.

How is she the one making the call on who to invite or not in the first place without consulting with you first, then throwing a tantrum when it is not met?\nIs that a common bridesmaid privilege?

It is your wedding and your choice of who you want to be there.\n\nI\u2019ve had a similar experience which caused problems in the family (i.e. a family member having a very expensive wedding and as a result many people were not invited without any notice) which is why I would personally choose to have a ceremony where there would be no limit on who I could invite but that is just me and there is no reason at all why you should feel the need to invite people who you have never met before to your special day.\n\nYour cousin is being totally unreasonable, it is your wedding not hers. \n\nI wish you all the best for your special day and the future.", "You wouldn't be the asshole.  She had no right to invite people you don't know to your wedding.  You gave her a perfectly valid reason for keeping things small but she and her family think this is disrespectful?  She and her family are being disrespectful of your wishes on your event. \n\nThere is going to be drama but the question is, do you mind having drama at your wedding?  This sounds like a drama-prone family and they will cause drama one way or the other.  I would much rather not have it on a special day and when they try to bring it up later, ignore it.", "NTA. It is completely abnormal for the bridesmaids to invite people. Noone but the bride and groom gets to invite people. Sometimes parents overstep on the claim that they are paying for it.

Any healthy 28 year old woman in the United States knows you don\u2019t invite people to others\u2019 weddings.

She created this mess entirely on her own.", "NTA. Perhaps she's projecting. She can invite all the people she wants to her own wedding, and if her boyfriend doesn't propose anytime soon, that's her problem. You don't invite people to someone else's wedding without permission regardless of if you're related/ in the wedding party. She's being immature. Sending the invite is going to either cause her to show up with uninvited guests in tow or is a waste of the time, money, and paper necessary for her invitation if she really doesn't show. I wouldn't send it and would probably reevaluate my relationship with her.", "NTA. How could someone possibly think it is normal to invite some random person to a wedding who has no connection to the people getting married? Like in what universe would that be a normal request? I literally just don\u2019t understand how someone could think in these terms.", "YWNBTA for sure, is your cousin confused about who\u2019s being celebrated at your wedding? Does she think this is like a high school play?? \u201cI\u2019ll be on stage with the rest of the bridal party\u201d???? Ban her from the wedding if you want to have a whole day that\u2019s just about you. If she gets in, all people will talk about is how she ruined the wedding. Cuz you know she\u2019ll blow it up (figuratively speaking) if she gets the chance.", "NTA. What the heck? Why is she going around telling strangers about a wedding that\u2019s not hers? It isn\u2019t a high school or college party. \n\nThis is just beyond weird. Definitely don\u2019t give in to her family\u2019s demands - it\u2019s your wedding, and you\u2019re paying for it, so you choose who gets to attend. I also don\u2019t see why her bf\u2019s mom would want to attend a wedding full of strangers in the first place.", "NTA - I can see her now at the reception telling people how her BF's Mom wouldn't even be there had she not pushed for it so she will be a MUCH better DIL to her than OP could be and that family clearly means soooo much more to her and blah blah blah...\n\nSounds like you're better off not having her there anyway - I mean honestly the NERVE to think she had free invites to pass out!", "Nta. Dont invite her and your problem is solved. Its your day not hers", "She's a guestzilla. \n\nShe also needs to stay uninvited.", "NTA.\n\nSending a save the date card is not the same as sending an invite. Don't send the invite and there is nothing she can do about it. She already said she would not come so why waste the invite.", "NTA It was inappropriate and rude to demand you invite someone else, especially a bf's mom? Ridiculous. Not sure WHY they'd even want to go. \n\nNo chance she's planning on getting proposed to or anything at your wedding and that's why bf is so adamant on mom being invited?", "NTA\n\nBut you should still send the invitation to be the bigger person.", "I think its because of our culture, we are Latinos and in our specific culture normally you can bring other people to a wedding but I had already explained to my entire family that my wedding is not going to be where they can invite whoever they want since my fianc\u00e9 and I are the ones paying for it and we wanted to keep it intimate. \nI told her she can bring my uncle and my other cousin because during that point of the conversation when she was talking about how she had to go uninvite people she thought that included my uncle and her sister(my other cousin). They live with her because of medical reasons and I was trying to clarify that my uncle and my cousin as well as her boyfriend were the ones invited not the other random people she wanted to bring as well.", "My uncle and my other cousin are under her care because of medical reasons and live with my cousin. I was going to send them all an invite since they live in the same household. I worded it that would be okay for her to bring them because during that point in the conversation she was talking about how she had to uninvite people and she mentioned my uncle and my other cousin not being invited. I let her know that they were invited and her boyfriend were invited but not the random people.", "I disagree on that one.\n\nThe cousin would show up with her partner's mother and cause more drama", "No, OP does not have to be the bigger person. You do not get to invite people to a wedding that is not your own.", "Thanks, this really helps clarify things. It seems like she is facing some serious embarrassment, both for inviting people that will not be allowed to attend, and for acting so foolishly to misunderstand the function of the save the date. \n\nYou would not be an asshole to disinvite the cousin. They have been clear on their conditions, and you do not agree with them.\n\nIf you want to salvage things with her, I would think about how you could help save her from embarrassment. That might be helping her be able to communicate that the wedding ended up planned differently from a typical Latino wedding. You don\u2019t owe her a favor here, but sorting this might be best for you. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would want to be aligned with her on who is attending before sending an invitation. I would not send an invitation unless there is a prior mutually agreed understanding of who will be there.", "Thanks for clarifying.  I was asking because it seemed like your cousin was having issues with social queues related to wedding invites. Is she possibly on the spectrum?   If so, she might need some clearer boundaries and expectations related to her.", "She\u2019ll probably do that regardless!", "Cousin is a bridesmaid, so not just anyone: worthy of being invited to a small and intimate wedding. I agree with mum and sister that, in the long run, sending the invite would avoid more drama that you can do without in the run up to a wedding.", "NTA. Who invites people to someone else\u2019s wedding? If she\u2019s embarrassed about having to uninvite people it\u2019s on her. She shouldn\u2019t have invited anyone. You\u2019re completely in the right and I think I\u2019d have already rescinded the invitation if I were you. Good luck", "NTA. I'm not sure who she's referring to by \"my family\" when she says they won't come, but if she means her parents? Call them. Simply say \"when I sent out save the dates she randomly started inviting people that I had no intention of inviting. Having my cousin's boyfriend's mother attend my wedding sounds like the start of a scary campfire story. She said you're all refusing to come if I don't invite this person. I just wanted you to know that I absolutely want you there, and I really do hope you come, but cousin really overstepped the mark inviting people I don't know to *my* wedding. I can't trust that she'll do the right thing, she's repeatedly doubled down that I should honour her invitation to the point where I'm afraid she'll turn up with a bunch of people I don't know. Frankly, my fianc\u00e9 doesn't want any of you there because of the drama. So I wanted to ask you directly. Should I invite you to my wedding, knowing that cousin's boyfriend's family isn't welcome?\"", "NTA.\n\nDoes your cousin think this is a cocktail party, where any and all may come? It's a wedding, attendance by invitation only. \n\nShe's wildly arrogant and you would be making a mistake to invite her now, as she's on suich a high horse she will surely sabotage the day.\n\nAnd really--her boyfriend's mother?", "Exactly this. NTA, obviously and please uninvite her for safety reasons.", "And the sister is 28!............. She hasn't even the excuse of being an excitable teenager who may not be fully aware of appropriate behaviour.", "[deleted]", "Cousin is definitely an AH and being ridiculous.  Though, if you don\u2019t actually know if her father and sister know of and/or agree with her actions, please consider inviting them!
