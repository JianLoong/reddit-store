At first, I corrected her and let her know I sent her a save the date (there was no information about the venue or times, just the date and the city and state the wedding was going to be at) and I figured she was just excited since she has never been in a wedding before. She started asking me about how many people she could bring, and I let her know because of costs and the size of the venue, she was only going to be able to bring her father, sister, and her long-term boyfriend.\n\nShe started freaking out that she had invited a lot of people to my wedding and now she had to tell them that they couldn't come and how that was embarrassing for her. I told her she never asked to invite people to my wedding and I didn't want people that I didn't know to be there. \n\nTwo minutes after she hung up, she called me back and gave me an ultimatum- I allow her to bring her boyfriend's mother (who I haven't met before and does not live with my cousin) or she was not going to be in my wedding. I told her firmly, \"I'm sorry you feel that way but that cannot be done. I'm sorry to hear that you don't want to be in the wedding anymore but I can't budge on this.\" I hung up the phone.\n\nAfter not speaking to her for a few months, I saw her yesterday at a family gathering, but she made it a point not to engage with me at all. I decided to text her after the gathering letting her know that I was sorry to miss her earlier but I wanted her to know the invitation was going to be sent next week.She asked again about her boyfriend's mother. I let her know again that was not possible, but depending on how many people RSVP,  I could see about the mom but I was not going to make any promises.

You don't invite people to someone else's wedding without permission regardless of if you're related/ in the wedding party. She's being immature.

It isn\u2019t a high school or college party. \n\nThis is just beyond weird.

You do not get to invite people to a wedding that is not your own.", "Thanks, this really helps clarify things. It seems like she is facing some serious embarrassment, both for inviting people that will not be allowed to attend, and for acting so foolishly to misunderstand the function of the save the date. \n\nYou would not be an asshole to disinvite the cousin. They have been clear on their conditions, and you do not agree with them.\n\nIf you want to salvage things with her, I would think about how you could help save her from embarrassment. That might be helping her be able to communicate that the wedding ended up planned differently from a typical Latino wedding. You don\u2019t owe her a favor here, but sorting this might be best for you. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would want to be aligned with her on who is attending before sending an invitation. I would not send an invitation unless there is a prior mutually agreed understanding of who will be there.", "Thanks for clarifying.  I was asking because it seemed like your cousin was having issues with social queues related to wedding invites. Is she possibly on the spectrum?   If so, she might need some clearer boundaries and expectations related to her.", "She\u2019ll probably do that regardless!", "Cousin is a bridesmaid, so not just anyone: worthy of being invited to a small and intimate wedding.

Who invites people to someone else\u2019s wedding? If she\u2019s embarrassed about having to uninvite people it\u2019s on her. She shouldn\u2019t have invited anyone.

I'm not sure who she's referring to by \"my family\" when she says they won't come, but if she means her parents? Call them. Simply say \"when I sent out save the dates she randomly started inviting people that I had no intention of inviting. Having my cousin's boyfriend's mother attend my wedding sounds like the start of a scary campfire story. She said you're all refusing to come if I don't invite this person. I just wanted you to know that I absolutely want you there, and I really do hope you come, but cousin really overstepped the mark inviting people I don't know to *my* wedding. I can't trust that she'll do the right thing, she's repeatedly doubled down that I should honour her invitation to the point where I'm afraid she'll turn up with a bunch of people I don't know. Frankly, my fianc\u00e9 doesn't want any of you there because of the drama. So I wanted to ask you directly. Should I invite you to my wedding, knowing that cousin's boyfriend's family isn't welcome?\"", "NTA.\n\nDoes your cousin think this is a cocktail party, where any and all may come?

Since she has already said she will not attend, take her at her word and leave her out.\n\nI also have a very sneaking suspicion that she either knows or thinks her BF will propose to her at the wedding.

We are also thinking the same thing about maybe he wanted to propose at my wedding which is a definite no no. Other than that we are not sure why the bf mom has to be there but like I mentioned, I have never met this lady before so I have no idea.", "When she meant her family, she meant her immediate family- her dad (my uncle), her sisters (my cousins), her brother-in-law, and her niece.

Also, the whole \u201cit\u2019ll cause more drama\u201d stuff if you don\u2019t invite them is total bullshit. You didn\u2019t cause drama, your cousin did. Don\u2019t send the invite", "Cause more drama? Hasn't this cousin caused enough. DON'T invite the malcontents using emotional blackmail??????\n\nNTA", "Nta so odd she thinks it's ok to ask to bring her bf mom", "NTA!! Your cousin is out of line. HOWEVER, I am petty queen yet I agree with your mother & sister. Send the invite. You have to balance the harm. If you don\u2019t invite them then they can cause more problems, if you do send the invite, in the way you planned to and told them, worst thing that happens is they send back a decline, and that puts the issue to rest officially. They can\u2019t slander you down the road and reinvent the past as long as you can say they were invited and it was *them* who declined. Congratulations on your wedding. Just send the invites and don\u2019t give this anymore energy. It\u2019s really not worth it, don\u2019t allow them to ruin what should be a good time for you, b/c that\u2019s their intent at this point.", "MULTIPLE people too. Not even a plus one. This is bananas.", "My uncle talked to my mom stating he is not interested in going. My cousin's sisters (she has the one that lives with her and the other lives out of the country with her husband and daughter) have blocked me on social media and the one that lives out of the country messaged me stating that she along with her husband and daughter will not be attending as well.", "Wow, this makes so much sense! I was wracking my brain trying to think of a reason why the cousin would be doing this, and a proposal honestly never occurred to me, probably because it's such an unreasonable thing to do that I just would never think of it.", "Yes, if this had been a plus-one, I would have been sympathetic. But wanting to invite your boyfriend's mother, whom the couple has no connection to?! That's insane.", "I wonder what tall tales your wacko, boundaryless cousin has been telling them to provoke such a harsh response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, obviously"]}
