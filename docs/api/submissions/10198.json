Hugs to you. It\u2019s funny that they\u2019re allowed to \u201cgrieve\u201d by trying to calculate their payout but you crying is somehow unacceptable.", "NTA but you need to have a private conversation with your Mom, find out what she has planned due to the younger ones and ask if she has set it up legally.  She may need to do this fast depending on what is going on.  Are you going to become the custodian of the kids. You mention a different Dad but yet you are going to take care of them.  Any funds should be allocated by her if there is time, especially since some siblings are already sticking their hand out for a cut.\n\nI am sorry for what you are going through and I hope your Mom makes it through so all of this becomes a non issue.", "NTA. Asking about inheritance isn\u2019t grieving. They\u2019re very self centred to allow you to take the burden of care (both physically and financially) of your siblings, even if he has autism, helping never hurt anybody.", "NTA and I am very sorry about your situation. I have seen this far too many times. I don\u2019t know what the financial situation will be, but it would seem your two minor siblings would have to have money set aside for their care?  Have your brothers said anything about this? Have either of your brothers brought up expenses of raising two minor teenagers? Are they prepared to offer financial help for them? I don\u2019t know how difficult the estate will be to settle, but how they say this is part of their \u201cgrieving\u201d process is pathetic.", "NTA your older siblings are acting in a disgusting manner. Yes some things need to be handled but they can wait. Honesty I would block them for my own well being if they keep it up. If they have questions on how long things take...they can google it. You have enough on your plate. Is your mother able to help with decisions now in case the worst happens? If so might be good to get things in writing for your younger siblings just in case the older ones try a money grab or something. I'm sorry about your mother and what you're going through.", "NTA - You should talk to your mom about setting up a trust.  And specifically a special needs trust for your autistic sibling.  Without a trust, her estate will need to go through probate, which  could take a year or more.  And even if she has a will, if your older siblings don't like it, they could contest it and drag it out.  If she's capable she should look into setting one up asap if she hasn't already.", "NTA.  I almost went NAH, but no...your brothers are AH.  I usually try to keep to the \"grief is individual\" mentality and know that it looks different for everyone.  I could understand focusing on the tangibles (how much does X cost? how did you arrange Y?) because it's easier to concentrate on that sometimes than the emotional aspect...but their concern of it coming out of their potential inheritance (if there's even anything to inherit since they don't seem to understand that the estate pays obligations first, then distributes and not the other way around) is just vile.  I don't care if violates the \"everyone grieves differently\" rule because I'm guessing someone whose go-to is worrying about what they'll get isn't that great of a person when they aren't grieving either.\n\nI'm sorry for what you're going through.", "NTA. I would've agreed with them on\n \n> They got angry and said it was their way of grieving and I don't have a monopoly on it. \n\nIf they didn't add:\n\n> They also said it was manipulative to cry at them. \n\nSo, their emotions/actions are just grieving but your emotions are manipulative. AH move right there.", "NTA, but they are.  Yes, people grieve differently, but focusing on what money you get and if you have to pay for a funeral at a time like this is . . . questionable at best.  I am so sorry about your mom.  I hope you get the support you and your younger siblings need.", "NTA. Sorry to hear about this. Illnesses like this bring out the true colours in people. Yes people grieve in different ways. Is asking about your inheritance and hoping you don\u2019t have to pay for the funeral part of that, hell no. For them to then make you feel worse by making out you\u2019re disregarding their grieving, is just doubling down on the assholeness.", "NTA and if mom is well enough to, talk with her about how to get a handle on the finances now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Next time one of them picks up the phone, tell them that because you were your father's sole daughter, you inherited all the money, but financial responsibility will absolutely be documented in the estate, and that you have plenty of receipts from burdening all of the expenses at this point which will be absolutely entered in as compensation and if they're worried about their share, it's time to man up and step up to help or be happy with whatever's leftover.\"", "And that they talk about manipulation when they use their \"grieve\" to do what they want.", "Thank you, this seems like a wise move.\nIf and when she regains lucidity and consciousness, we will for sure discuss it further as I hope this will be the best way to honour her wishes", "Thank you \ud83d\ude2d It's hard because I almost definitely won't even break even with inheritance.

I reiterate: make sure you mom gets a will done ASAP, and continue to seek free or reduced rate legal advice.", "Yes! Keep the travel receipts and document \"childcare\". Bill the estate for it, and split the money with your little siblings or give it to them. Do whatever you can legally to reduce what your older brothers get.

I'm a kinship caregiver of two children whose mom passed away. I know it sucks to have to think about now, but be sure to apply to SSI as soon as your mom passes. Your mom has a set amount that her underage heirs can access. It's based on how much she payed in. For reference, my kids' mom qualified for about $600 a month. She had very minimal work history and passed on her 20s, so if your mom had a job ever, her kids are likely entitled to significantly more. Some states additionally have kinship caregiver payments. They're monthly payments meant to help keep kids in kinship homes and out of foster care. Contact your local cps to see if your area offers it.", "The rest should absolutely not be split equally. The bulk of what\u2019s left should be for the two minors, to be used by whomever takes them in. Your older brothers had her support and presence into adulthood. Your mom did her duty to them. Now the focus needs to be on the minors. Good luck", "NTA. I feel you, my bonus does a couple of years ago and it was a mess. I'd get her lawyer and some kind of medical file that states she is in her right mind. There's a chance they'd right against the will saying she was sick and not on her right mind. Then the last will would be skilled and the one prior to that one will be the one they'd use.\nI don't know what country you're in, but if you want to message me, I can try to help. I've been a lawyer's assist and for pretty much my whole life (both parents are lawyers). So if you need help navigating this, please drop me a message and I'll see what I can do to help you.\nPlease don't forget about the Dr's paper or the will will be void.\nI hope your mum can have the best life she can with her illness. I hope she doesn't feel pain and she just feels the love you and your younger siblings have for her.\nI know this will sound mad, but try to get her something that makes her happy, even the oddest thing she wants.\nMy dad's aunt had a throat cancer (I'm not sure where it was exactly) and on her last days she ordered boxes of French champagne because she was told she had to be on a liquid diet and if that was the last thing she could take, she wanted her lasts days enjoying herself.\nWish you straight and love \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta holy shit that's your mom + you're holding a lot of sadness from loss of childhood raising your siblings I imagine =(", "Nta, but you chose to engage in talking to them.
