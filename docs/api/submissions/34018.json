He left all he has to me as he\u2019s been estranged from his family for decades.\n\nMy husband was the stepdad of my two daughters Jane (38) and Ava (36) for 23 years (their bio dad passed shortly after Ava\u2019s birth). They all had good relationships. Jane and Ava are now married with a child each and see us several times a year. They both live about an hour from my place.\n\nThe thing is, while Jane and her husband are doing OK financially, Ava\u2019s husband is a surgeon with a private clinic of his own. They\u2019re doing very well with a housekeeper taking care of their home and overseas vacation twice a year. They always pick up the bills whenever we go out, be it a restaurant or a family get together at a vacation spot.\n\nMost significantly, my late husband was in poor health for a few years before passing. Ava\u2019s husband took care of all medically related issues like connecting us with an expert, making sure we file documents correctly as well as paying for room upgrades from what was covered in the insurance. Without his help, my husband\u2019s last years wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable as they were. For Jane\u2019s part, she and her husband visited more often when learning her stepdad was sick and helped out with a few things around the house that used to be under my husband\u2019s care like mowing the lawn or fixing faulty devices.\n\nI was writing my will and thought Ava should receive more inheritance because she\u2019s been helping out more. I don\u2019t have a lot to give but their stepdad left some lovely jewelry and a small rental property for me. I thought of splitting the jewelry between my girls but Ava would get the property and more money.\n\nAva and her husband are already in such a well off financial situation while Jane and her husband are just doing OK. Still, I want to show Ava how much I appreciate her help and want to pay her back somewhat, so WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1703896588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18u28in/wibta_for_giving_more_to_one_daughter_in_my_will/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like Jane ignored her stepdad. Clearly, she and her husband helped where and how they could, but I guess a room upgrade means more to you than helping with everyday chores. It's your money so you can do what you want with it, but leaving Ava more will probably destroy the relationship between your daughters.", "How could not be TA. They both seem to help out in the best ways that they are capable within their abilities yet you want to favor the daughter who has the more successful husband because you value the money they gave more so then the physical contribution at the other gave? I tend to think if we asked more of a story, we would see more examples throughout the years if you\u2019re favoring one child of the other for some arbitrary baseline.\n\nIf my theory about how you view your children and does have treaty of children is correct then I bet if you decide to leave one child more than other because of this then you will definitely be guaranteeing that the two of them have less of a relationship with each other or none at all after you pass.", "Do you think it's wise for your kids to deal with losing you and then thinking you played favorites? It's not hard to have the appreciation conversations now rather than them seeing it when you pass.", "YWBTA. Ava and her husband helped out in the ways they could (financially), and Jane and her husband helped out in the ways they could (chores, etc.). I don't think Ava did it expecting financial return, and doesn't actually need to be paid back. \n\nMost importantly, I think you will drive a wedge between your children by favoring one over the other after you are gone. Do you want that to be your legacy?", "It sounds like Jane gave time. Does that not have value? Just because he could not pull stings. They gave from their heart. Both daughters sound wonderful. Honestly, I feel sick for Jane. \n\nIf you do this YTA.", "Yes, YWBTA\n\nBoth contributed. One gave you money and helped with the medical side of things. One gave her time and effort so you could focus on his needs. Each gave according to what they could provide. \n\nAva helped from a distance. Every time Jane helped it required her to put in a two hour commute. Her contribution was not any less than her sister\u2019s just because she didn\u2019t have money to buy your appreciation. \n\nI would suggest talking to both daughters and telling them both how much you love them and are grateful for what they have done for you, and ask them what part of the inheritance each would appreciate being given.", "Seek legal advice. Depending on the laws of the land, your will may be challenged and it can ruin family bonds permanently. It seems more sensible they get the proceeds of the rental equally.\n\nAre there no grandchildren? You could bequeath the money under trust to them preferentially.", ">Ava should receive more inheritance because she\u2019s been helping out more. \n\nHow do you figure? Sounds like each of them helped in their own way. One was qualified to help with the medical side of things and did so,  the other one wasn't connected, medically speaking, but still went out of her to find ways to make a difficult situation easier. \n\nIs there a reason you are trying to justify having a favorite child?\n\nYTA", "Don't do this unless all three of you agree to it. My husband and I have taken care of my mom for a decade (she lives with us and we had to buy a new place to have space for her) and pay for nearly everything. We also financially do better than my sister and her family. \n\nI asked my mom to leave my sister more because she needs it. I know my mom appreciates our help, and I don't need money to prove it. \n\nMy sister and mom don't want an uneven split in her favor so we are discussing how to address this. But I want my sister to have it because it will be meaningful to her family, whereas it is less impactful for us. \n\nI know you want to show appreciation for Ava but don't do so at the expense of Jane. Make her a meal or write her a letter. Those things would mean so much more than money for someone who has enough to live on.", "Yta. Why even cause a problem when there isnt one", "YWBTA. Each daughter and her husband helped in the ways they were able. Giving the richer daughter more because she was able to use her existing money to help, while the other was unable to financially help so helped in other, practical ways, would be really unfair. In the end it's your money and your choice but yes, I think YWBTA.", "YWBTA. Each of your daughters and their husbands helped out in their own way. While Ava's husband provided help on the medical side, Jane's husband provided labour and **probably spent a lot more time helping than did the other.** Keeping your property in shape is a lot more time consuming, inconvenient and a greater sacrifice than making a few phone calls to contacts and paying for outings that he can easily afford. \n\nIf you do not divide the estate equally, Jane will resent you and her sister as well. Jane also needs the money more. \n\nOh, yes, you would definitely be an asshole if you left more to Ava.", "Yta - you shouldn\u2019t reward them with extra because  they could and you are grateful.  Do you love one more than the other. Hopefully not. Do you want them to remain close after you pass because this kind of shit will create a wedge between them with sprinkle of resentment that will last forever.", "YTA.\n\nThe rich ones gave money and connections, the others gave time, and you want to give more to the rich ones?\n\nAre you sure you're not punishing Jane for not marrying a doctor?\n\nI'm a cardiologist. My father-in-law has some heart issues. He comes to my practice and is treated by the colleague I suggested would be best for him, who doesn't charge him any out of pocket fees because of our relationship. When he was an inpatient he joked about how he got treated like a celebrity because his file said he was my partner's father.\n\nThe colleague who treated him is very hard to get to see at all.\n\nI would be absolutely disgusted if this got us preferential treatment in his will. If either of my partner's parents sent that explicit a message that they don't value my role in their lives by how much I make their daughter happy or by how good a parent I am to their grandchild, but rather by how much my professional connections benefit them.\n\nYour attitude is sickening. It's not love, commitment, time or care that matter, nor is it need. It's just whether you can use someone.", "YTA.  If you want to cause a rift between your daughters then you've found a way to do it. My two older brothers are extremely wealthy and my parents still divided their estates evenly because they knew that there is no better way to break up a family than with finances.", "YWBTA I don't see from your description how he helped out more. It sounds like equal helping to me. So why are you valuing one Son in law handling medical files more than the other Son in law mowing the lawn? They're *both* helping.\n\nMaybe keep it all equal in the will but leave each son in law something with your loving thanks, instead. Then everyone gets to feel appreciated.", "YWBTA if you did this. Sell the property, split the money equally. Don\u2019t do what you had planned. You will just drive a wedge and cause needless pain. Both helped, if you can\u2019t see that, talk to a therapist.", "YWBTA \u2026 both daughters did what they could to support you. From the sound of it Ava\u2019s husband helped with money but Jane and her husband took the time to do the manual labor which was how they could support you. \n\nYou are punishing Jane for not marrying a surgeon. That is just wrong. Why are you putting the financial support above the physical labour support. \n\nSplit it evenly or you will destroy any relationship the sisters have. Jane will just see Ava as the favoured daughter and is that really the legacy you want to leave your daughters?", "Write a thank you note. When you\u2019re gone, your girls will need each other. This could divide them. It\u2019s your money - you can do what you want. I just think this could do more harm than good.", "Yta so they both helped according to their skill level, and yet thats not good enough for you.  If you want to show your appreciation, SHOW IT NOW.  Tell them! Write a letter! Something!", "Itnsounds like each daughter helped in the best way they could. I think you just have a favorite daughter.\nYWBTA", "YTA. \nMy condolences, but you don\u2019t show appreciation with money. I can\u2019t even follow your logic the slightest. Invite all of them for a family dinner and express your appreciation. You know.. communication and hugs. \nYour plan will probably ruin not only your daughter\u2019s relationship but also yours and Janes.", "I bet when you're out with friends you talk about the doctors wife a lot more than Jane. \nMy husband has a mother that sounds like you and I've noticed.", "YWBTA. \n\nAva helped more because her husband had a specific knowledge and skill set that was helpful at that time. Jane has done what she can with the resources she has. \n\nGiving Ava more because she has more financial resources and spousal expertise to give is a low blow.", "YWBTA \nGenerally, when inheritance is favoring one party over the other, it is because the party receiving less has done little or done wrong in the eyes of the deceased. I was fully expecting to open up this post and find out that one daughter had been rude or unsupportive while the other bent over backwards but instead, I discovered that you have two kind and earnest daughters, each attempting to contribute in their own way. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that Ava\u2018s husband was in a unique position to help out due to his wealth and profession. It\u2019s unfair to weigh that against jane and judge her as deserving less especially as her financial situation is not the same. \n\nInheritances are often touchy because they are a final message from the deceased and so division of the assets can (accurately) be seen as division of affection.", "In the end, it\u2019s your money. You can do what you want with it.\n\nHowever, both your daughters helped out and showed they cared. In love, I\u2019m sure they gave you and your husband equally. In turn, you should show them you appreciate them and not place one kind of contribution as more superior than the other.\n\nMy suggestion will be to split things equally. You already told us there isn\u2019t a lot to give to start with, so you shouldn\u2019t let this small amount cause resentment between your daughters.\n\nI will have to say YWBTA. You have the right to do as you please but you really should consider how the split would impact Jane and Ava\u2019s relationship.", "YTA. Reading through it again your love language appears to be money and status. Your specialist son in law did really well by your deceased husband but did he direct his assistant to actually do the work?\nMaybe you should give money to his assistant instead. \n\nJane contributed with what she could offer which was time and physical effort. I  can't see how you are unable to see this", "So to summarize Ava is the golden child you love the most and Jan isn't.  How can you show them that Ava is the favorite and Jane isn't?  Definitely an unjust split of your assets in the will will get that point across and as an added bonus will drive a wedge between Jane and Ava for the rest of their lives.  YTA and really just a dreadful parent it's cringeworthy.", "YWBTA- don\u2019t be a shit mom. Make better choices with the time you have.", "YTA, that's a huge gap in inheritance when you stated ava doesn't even need the money.  It's not like Jane did nothing.  Damn this is playing favourites pretty hard here", "I mean if your goal is to put a wedge between your two kids, I mean you\u2019re going about it right way", "Ywbta. They should inherit equally. You have no idea what the future holds- the rich one could be broke or have a catastrophic accident or death or lawsuit or loss or life changing injury tomorrow. This is favoritism disguised as fairness when it\u2019s not fair at all, it would be felt as a big FU to Jane, don\u2019t delude yourself into thinking otherwise.", "YTA. They both helped in ways they could and you are ranking them for no reason.", "YTA-Ava\u2019s husband helping out financially doesn\u2019t mean Ava and her husband contributed more. Jane and her husband found ways to help and their contributions were just as important.", "When you leave, your daughters will be coping with the loss of you in their lives. Unlike so many families here on Reddit, it sounds like you are all in a good relationship, valuing each other, visiting each other etc. Think hard about what it will be like as they go through the grieving process, and learning about their inheritance. Do you want them to fight? Do you want them to resent you? or think back on your time together and reframe things that they thought were done in love and not considered transactional? You will set them up for division. I work with some very lovely doctors who make more than others in their family. Because they have more income they are often more generous with it, but are not expecting payback. If you want to express your gratitude then do so while you are still alive. Jane and her husband also helped you in the way that they could. Do you value their help less because it didn't have the same price tag attached? YWBTA if you set them up to resent you. Jane definitely won't thank you because you would be punishing her for not having a wealthy husband; Ava will probably also resent you for setting her up for a fight, when it sounds like the assistance they gave you was purely out of kindness and love. Think hard.", "No better way to cause a family rift.", "Sounds like both daughters helped out and were present so why would you do that? Clearly Ava is your golden child. Don\u2019t drive a wedge between them as sisters because your favorite child married a surgeon.", "Yta\n\nSo the poor one gave what they could, time, and the rich ones, money and contacts \n\nAbd you want to make the rich one richer...\n\nI hope your daughter learns it and goes non contact", "You can do whatever you wish with your possessions, assign them any way you want.  \n\nHowever, a caution.  This isn\u2019t going to work out well.  You\u2019re making this transactional\u2026and there was never any way Jane and her husband could compete with what Ava and her husband could do.  It\u2019s like Jane is being penalized because she didn\u2019t marry a doctor who could provide free medical advice and pay for perks and dinners and vacations.  I don\u2019t say this to diminish the generosity of Ava\u2019s husband.  But each of your daughters and their husbands contributed according to their means.  By singling out Ava to receive more, you\u2019re essentially saying Jane didn\u2019t do enough.  That things like keeping the lawn mowed or fixing broken devices were meaningless.\n\nMoreover, you\u2019re setting your daughters up for conflict after you\u2019re gone.  I can\u2019t imagine any scenario where Jane won\u2019t be incredibly hurt that her mother thought more of her sister\u2019s help than hers, so much so that she left Ava property and money she doesn\u2019t actually need.  Do you honestly think that Jane isn\u2019t going to resent your favoritism towards Ava?  You may end up doing irreparable harm to their relationship.  \n\nYWBTA to single Ava out for extra when it sounds like both your daughters were trying to be as helpful as they were able to be given their means.", "So... you're giving more to one daughter because her husband is able to do more for you than the other.  He and your daughter are doing significantly better than your other daughter.  \n\nI get that you want to repay Ava and her husband for what they've done, but you need to realize that your other daughter is going to take this as her being punished because she and her husband couldn't do as much for you.  It also makes it sound like your love for them is a bit transactional... and the end result is more likely to cause the relationship between your daughters worse. \n\nIn the end, you can do with your stuff what you like.  If you decide to give more to Ava and Jane, it's up to you.  Jane will be hurt by your decision though.  YTA for this.", "YTA. One gave financially but the other gave their time which is priceless. Ava and her husband gave financially and helped professionally because they could afford to and had the experience. Had Jane been in the same position, it sounds like they would have done the same. You\u2019re punishing Jane because she isn\u2019t well off and that\u2019s a great way to cause animosity between the two sisters when you\u2019re gone.", "NAH - your choice. But, personally, I think assets should be split amongst children equally. You\u2019re inviting potential animosity.", "YWBTA. Ava\u2019s husband is a surgeon and he helped you out with your medical knowledge. Jane and her husband helped in the ways that they could. You\u2019re seriously considering punishing Jane because she didn\u2019t marry a doctor? Leaving more money to Ava simply because she married a doctor will drive a serious wedge between your daughters. Is that what you want? For you to be gone and them to not speak to each other?", "to be fair, the daughter who is more well off is kinda more suitable to own a rental property as it would be easier for her and her husband to afford repairs or any kind of upkeep while the one who is less well off might not be able to do those kinds of things without potentially hurting their own finances to start", "YWBTA. \n\nBoth girls did what they could to help. Did you expect Jane's husband to go to medical school in order to help \"more?\" Jane's husband took on household duties, they visited, they ensured your life was easier and you plan to punish them for it. Essentially you are stating that only Ava's husband, not even Ava, is worthy of assets due to his job.", "YTA. Both of you're daughters gave from  what they had  themselves. One had more money, knowledge, and connections which was wonderful. The other came more and gave time and help. You would be  punishing one for not having more to give, it sounds like she also would have given the same if she'd had them.", "YWBTA, and it\u2019s a short answer: there\u2019s no reason not to simply divide whatever may be left between them.", "YTA.\n\nYou'd be telling your daughters that you love one daughter a lot more than the other - so much more that you decided she was more worthy to receive anything from you.\n\nUnless that's the message you want to send, and you don't care if you completely crush the daughter you don't think deserves as much, you should have it be divided equally.", "YTA. Do you really want them to inherit probable resentment towards you and each other? It sounds like both daughters and their husbands helped in ways they were able to. Split the will down the middle. If you want to thank them, a genuine thank you goes a long way. Take them out to dinner or something.", "YWBTA. They both helped as much as they could and in the way they could. Im sure Jane would have connected you with medical resources if she had them available. \n\nYou\u2019re turning this into some kind of gross contest.", "Yes yta\u2026 Jane and her husband were doing what they could.

You say Jane and her husband contributed more time and I would hope that's valuable to you too.\n\nHaving just been through the deaths of both my parents this past year, I spent a ton of time taking care of them and trying to keep them safe. I spent a ton of money trying to buy them extra conveniences and smooth things over for them. I have several siblings who ranged from being entirely absent to being intermittent in their support, but I know sometimes my mother massively overvalued the contributions of my youngest sibling (who is very sporadic, and thus, she valued it more than my consistency even though without me showing up consistently, they would have suffered while without my youngest sibling occasionally mailing meals, their life wouldn't have been noticeably different).\n\nI feel lost without my mom (I know I'll be fine, and I am fine, but still, I feel lost). None of my siblings seem to feel the same at all -- in fact, they have made comments about being glad that they don't have to worry about her anymore.\n\nIf you value your daughters' relationship with one another, I'd suggest being explicitly fair so that you're not giving them any reason to feel resentful of one another.

They made contributions with what they are capable of. \n\nAlso I feel that 63yo is fairly young for you to give away your husband's assets. Keep it for yourself and only will it after your passing (wishing you many more blessed years). You never know what might happen in the future and the finances might come in handy.", "YWBTA. I can't find any mention of what Ava actually did - it's all her husband (and his money?).  Just because Ava was \"lucky\" to marry someone who has a high paying job (and medical knowledge) she deserves to inherit more? Makes no sense. Comparing the two daughters directly, Jane seems to have stepped up more, it sounds like from your post.", "YWBTA, and worse - you may ruin the relationship between your daughters. This is not the way to express gratitude.", "Both of your daughters contributed what they were able to contribute. I don't understand why you value one contribution more than the other. I also don't understand why you would want to leave more money and a property to the daughter who is already financially well off. I just don't get your mindset. It seems like you'd be punishing Jane for not being rich, or rewarding Ava for being so. So yes, YWBTA.", "Both helped in their own way. \n\nYWBTA - please split your estate 50/50. If you want to recognize efforts ask your daughters privately if there is anything special they would like (jewelry, something of sentimental value). \n\nThe rental property and cash, divided equally.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He left all he has to me as he\u2019s been estranged from his family for decades.\n\nMy husband was the stepdad of my two daughters Jane (38) and Ava (36) for 23 years (their bio dad passed shortly after Ava\u2019s birth). They all had good relationships. Jane and Ava are now married with a child each and see us several times a year. They both live about an hour from my place.\n\nThe thing is, while Jane and her husband are doing OK financially, Ava\u2019s husband is a surgeon with a private clinic of his own. They\u2019re doing very well with a housekeeper taking care of their home and overseas vacation twice a year. They always pick up the bills whenever we go out, be it a restaurant or a family get together at a vacation spot.\n\nMost significantly, my late husband was in poor health for a few years before passing. Ava\u2019s husband took care of all medically related issues like connecting us with an expert, making sure we file documents correctly as well as paying for room upgrades from what was covered in the insurance. Without his help, my husband\u2019s last years wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable as they were. For Jane\u2019s part, she and her husband visited more often when learning her stepdad was sick and helped out with a few things around the house that used to be under my husband\u2019s care like mowing the lawn or fixing faulty devices.\n\nI was writing my will and thought Ava should receive more inheritance because she\u2019s been helping out more. I don\u2019t have a lot to give but their stepdad left some lovely jewelry and a small rental property for me. I thought of splitting the jewelry between my girls but Ava would get the property and more money.\n\nAva and her husband are already in such a well off financial situation while Jane and her husband are just doing OK. Still, I want to show Ava how much I appreciate her help and want to pay her back somewhat, so WIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hugely.  Jane did what she could, and was there for you.  Just because she doesn't have the means to write big checks doesn't mean she didn't do everything she could.  I would be SO disappointed to find out my mother was so shallow and materialistic.", "YWBTA. There are so many better ways to express your gratitude than this, but it sounds like they both provided you with help and support, so it\u2019s kinda weird that you\u2019re focused on one side\u2019s help. Take both of your daughters and their partners out to a nice dinner, give them cards and write a heartfelt individualised notes about how much you appreciate the help they have you. I cannot imagine receiving an equal portion of my inheritance and thinking \u201cwow my parents did not appreciate my support\u201d and if you raised your daughters to be kind, reasonable people, they won\u2019t mind. \n\nIn terms of inheritance, you should probably just do 50:50 (unless you think the Ava would be ok with you giving a little more to Jane given it would likely help her more).", "A soft YWBTA. Could you split it relatively evenly and leave a little something to the husband/couple as a special thanks for all his/their extra effort with your husband? My maternal aunt did that for my dad and no one was offended because he did so much extra to help her out. Just a suggestion", "Keep the rental and split the jewelry.\n\nAva's husband did not have to do any of that, but she asked him to and he likely wanted to because it was her father and they love him. I am certain that Jane would've done the same if she could have.\n\nIf you really are placing the girls on a different level because your son in law happens to have medical connections and Ava married him, that's very gross. You are all grieving, there is not point in making this a contest.\n\nYWBTA", ">Is there a reason you are trying to justify having a favorite child?\n\nThis is the question.", "Agreed. Treat them the same", "This is the best answer I\u2019ve read.", "This. All of this \ud83d\udc46", "This is exactly right.  The most important thing you can do for your daughters is encourage them to have a good relationship.  Giving them different amounts jeopardises that.  \n\nAlso you don\u2019t know what the future will bring.  You may not pass for several years and in the next few years Jane might provide huge amounts of help and Ava might provide very little.  And you might not change your will to reflect that.", "I was thinking this too. It is something she is not considering and that's a mistake. She won't be around to explain anything and it will definitely be considered a slight.", "Even if it doesn't drive a wedge between them, it will absolutely taint their memory of their mother. I can't even imagine having that as my mom's parting shot. Horrible.", "They did the \"big things\". Time is the most important gift you can give, and cutting the lawn on a regular basis and helping around the house (especially if it took a 2 hour drive to do this) is a bigger deal that phoning a colleague to set up an appointment and handing out money that he can easily afford.", "I think we need clarification as to how much the extra help that Janes side did amounts to mowing lawns once every two weeks and a fix on a faulty device might not be much on a conservative estimate. Wills and inheritance is a tricky thing where the money belongs to the OP and none of the beneficiaries are deserving therefore even if one daughter got nothing it wouldn\u2019t be an asshole move in my opinion.", "Please heed this advice. \n\nJane and her husband actually didn't do anything wrong and they didn't not step up to the plate to help out. Don't punish her for not being rich. Don't punish her for not being married to a doctor.\n\nDon't make her think she did something wrong to make you think less of her. Don't make her wonder what she did over the course of her life for you to love her less or not love her at all.\n\nDon't turn the sister's against each other.", "Agreed.", "I mean if you look at it that way did Ava actually do much? Her husband did all the extra stuff with his connections. Ava didn\u2019t really do any thing but should be rewarded because she married a surgeon? \n\nBoth daughters contributed what they could and there is no reason to split the will unevenly", "If you treat your daughters differently in your will, you will either destroy their relationship with each other, or they will ignore what your will says and divide your estate equally anyway. Talk to a lawyer who specializes in estate planning and get some advice.", "Will it to the Ava husband if it\u2019s more impartial. In life you don\u2019t deserve an inheritance so you can be upset with the one you get.", "I agree no one is entitled to inheritance. My issue is not splitting it evenly in this instance. \n\nShe is undervaluing Jane\u2019s contributions because they weren\u2019t financial. That\u2019s wrong in my mind and she will just destroy the sister\u2019s relationship if she does this", "If you are not entitled to something why are you upset if you have something to a lesser degree. Should Jane be upset if she got less of something she never earned?", "Imagine you are a happy family.\n\nEveryone respects each other and as far as you know everyone is loved evenly.\n\nThen your mother dies and your sister gets more than you for inheritance but only because she married someone with connections. \n\nHuman nature is going to make Jane feel like she is less than her sister. \n\nWhy even make that a possibility if you are a parent?"]}
