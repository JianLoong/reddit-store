I'm a few years ahead of you and decided to jog again -- that was a mistake; Baker's cyst.  Went skiing last winter and took a fall.  Wasn't hurt by the fall but was dented severely when this guy in his 30s asked \"ma'am, are you okay, do you need help up!?\"    I'm concerned now that by the time I *get* to retire, I'll be too broken down to enjoy doing the things I love, like hiking and skiing.   \n\nBut at the same time your wife has probably worked and done and worked and done for everyone else, and she would like to enjoy the nest she's made, time for herself to do nothing, and time with her grandkids.  So see if you can find some compromises where you still get each other's company, but you get to stay active, and/or see if you can find a moderately active activity that you both enjoy. \n\nMy dream for retirement is a couple of good backpacks, sturdy shoes, and invading the tiny cafes of many European countries until I become fluent enough to translate and understand  the local invectives against we horrible American tourists.   My husband's dream of retirement involves a sailboat.  We'll figure out some middle ground somewhere.", "YTA. Not for wanting to continue those activities,  but for how you talked to your wife about it.  \n\nFirst,  it may be that she actually hasn't lost interest in those activities; she may have lost the physical ability to do them comfortably or safely.  If so,  she's probably dealing with some grief over not being able to do these things or continue enjoying them with you. So your \"old people $#!+\" comment probably stings.  Think... how would you feel if you were in an accident or developed a medical condition that slowed you down..... you're already feeling like a *lesser version of yourself... and she went on vacations without you and said she was going to keep spending time without you because she wasn't ready to do broke people $#!+.  That would be pretty messed up,  right?\n\nBut even if it's purely an interest issue and the only physical part is her being a bit more tired, she's likely feeling hurt because you seem so unbothered doing stuff without her. \n\nShe shouldn't drag your activities and you shouldn't drag hers.  She may enjoy those other things on vacation, but they probably feel a bit hollow alone.\n\nCan you plan vacations where you both go but she still gets to spend time with you?  A couple days you both do your own thing,  a couple days you do stuff together.   Go with another couple, have individual days,  couples days,  group days, and friend days. \n\nIf you love her, put in the effort.

I\u2019m not sure about your gardening, but mine is a ton of work, so it definitely doesn\u2019t qualify as old people sh!t.  The problem is you expected her not to change.  People change.

It\u2019s one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to face and I\u2019m younger than your wife.  I think you should make sure her slowing down isn\u2019t health based, increased fatigue, noticing memory or mental issues, slowed response times.  All things that might make her feel unsafe doing things such as skiing and scuba diving.  I also think you need to stop insulting her interests.  There is nothing wrong with gardening and reading.  Instead say, you don\u2019t have to go diving, you can enjoy a book on the patio and we can enjoy going out for a nice dinner after or wouldn\u2019t a pretty lodge with a fireplace be a great place to relax, read and watch people.

Then when you didn\u2019t try to convince her to go with you, and instead just listened to what she told you, she felt too embarrassed to go back on what she said and just ask to come along, so she stayed home and regretted it instead.\n\nI find a lot of people don\u2019t actually say what they want, because they want you to guess and make them feel more wanted, and then get mad when you just listen to them instead of playing some mind guessing game.", "NTA.

I'm 54. I still enjoy skiing, scuba diving, hiking, etc. My wife used to be my partner in all that stuff. Now she is happy reading, gardening, watching TV, and being a grandma. \n\nI love being a grandpa. But I like taking my grandchildren out to the pool, or the park. I do play games at home with them as well. \n\nMy wife says that she doesn't want to do the things we used to do any more.  She says she doesn't have the energy any more. I don't mind doing them on my own. For example this last winter she got to stay at the hotel, the chalet, and town while I went skiing. This summer she didn't want to come down to the Carribean to go scuba diving. I would have loved her company but she said she wanted to help with the grandkids more. I said I understood but I still wanted my vacation. So I went. \n\nWhen I got back she was upset with me. She said I was an asshole for taking a vacation without her. She could have come. I just wasn't interested in hanging around the city for an extra two weeks. She said that she felt like I abandoned her. I said I worked hard my life so I could enjoy it not to lay like a potato. She said her new hobbies might be sedentary but she enjoyed them. I said that was fine but I didn't want to do old people shit until I absolutely had to.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did you discuss the vacation with her beforehand and then just leave when she didn\u2019t want to go?

Obviously this may not be the case at all, but just something to consider, as well as other potential health concerns.", "YTA. People do get older, and their preferences change. You are very condescending and narcissistic. She still wants a vacation, with you, she just doesn\u2019t want scuba diving anymore.

Not everyone ages in the same way.  Some people are lucky enough to keep active well into old age.  Other people end up just not able to do the same amount of physical activity.  The key here is compromise.\n\nI also wonder if there is some gendered division of labor here... she said she wanted to 'help with the grandkids' rather than go on vacation.  Does she feel pressure to help out your kids with the grandkids?  Is she doing regular childcare that makes it hard to get away?  Are your kids depending on her help somewhat?  In a lot of families, there's an implicit idea that women will help with the kids that men are exempt from to a large extent.  She may be feeling pressure to be a more active caregiving presence in their lives than you are.  I saw it with my own parents when they were around your age and my kids were really little- my dad enjoyed the grandkids and doing stuff with them, but my mom felt more pressure to, say, help me with the kids if I was sick or something.  It wouldn't occur to my dad to have changed plans if I was in a bind and needed help with the kids while my spouse was away, but it would have occurred to my mom without me asking.", "NTA - You've always tried to include her. She wants to pursue different hobbies now, and that's fine, but that shouldn't restrict you from pursuing yours.", "NTA. Our situation is reversed. My wife is the one who has all the energy.

How would you feel if she downplayed your interests and did the same general phrasing to you? \"Oh Caribbean again, this is what--your fourth midlife crisis?\" \"A camping trip? Geeze you really have to get away to avoid seeing your grandkids.\" Stop being an A by treating her badly. You **can** like different things, you know.", "NTA.

My husband, 36, likes to ski and occasionally challenge himself on difficult hikes or bike 20 miles.  We have absolutely zero issues accommodating our lifestyles.\n\nIn fact, I love going on ski trips with him.  I love snow and knitting or crocheting indoors with a hot drink while he skis.  If he wanted to go to the Carrabean to scuba I'd sure as hell go with to read on the beach.\n\nYou wanted to go on a vacation and she didn't. That was her choice to make and now it seems she regrets it. It could be she's actually upset that she feels left out of your life but is framing it the wrong way.  I'd definitely talk to her.  Maybe she feels like you two are drifting apart and that's always upsetting.\n\nEdit: YTA for how you talked to her though.  You have a very limited and bizarre idea of what constitutes \"old people stuff\" if that was old people stuff then I'd be old since I was 10 and packing 5 books in my bag every day to read them all.\n\nI'm looking at your comments and starting to think there's definitely a LOT more wrong in your relationship than what you are presenting.  Please just talk to her, and treat her like an adult and your wife not an old biddy.", "NTA Wife could have gone to the Carribean and stayed in the hotel or laid by the pool, reading a book, while he scuba dived.

This was not necessary. \n\nBut NAH for the mere fact you are doing more active things and she is becoming more of a homebody.", "YTA. You ignore the fact that she says she doesn't have the energy for these things and seem to only go on vacations for stuff for YOU, not both of you. If her age bothers you that much, you either need to rethink your relationship OR you need to address your insecurity of getting older, since it also seems like you're taking it out on her.", "YTA for insulting your wife.\n\nIt sounds like there's stuff OP is missing out, especially when he says one of the wife's reasons was that she wanted to help out with the kids and he complains that he didn't want to hang round an extra two weeks. \n\nSeems like something else was going on at the time that meant a holiday wasn't ideal", "that is what getting older means i guess. NTA.", "NTA, but you sound like one.", "She made an unreasonable complaint until it baited you into making an unreasonable statement.

This is the way! To be fair, your wife is entitled to enjoy the things she likes as well, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to slow down and be miserable yourself.

She's too young to have that big a do in energy. Most people work till they are 65 or older, so at 60 she should still have enough energy to do the stuff she always did. It's fine that she wants to change hobbies, but the energy dip might be an indication of something that's seriously wrong. \n\nAlso reading and gardening are for all ages. I hike, read, garden, craft, do yoga and many more things. I'm 38.", "Sounds like she would have gone if you waited 2 weeks. Did she commit to looking after grandkids for that time? Is that what you meant by not hanging around city for an extra 2 weeks? If so, YTA.  It\u2019s the type of vacation where you could go scuba diving while she laid on the beach reading, and then meet up after to do shared activities. No wonder she feels abandoned.", "NTA\n\nThough you were a little mean towards the end, you were minding your business. You were ok letting her do her thing while you still went out to do your own thing.

She\u2019s free to hang out with the grandkids, and she\u2019s free to stay home, but she can\u2019t expect you to sit around simply because she wants to sit around.

No that's not fair you didn't abandon her she chose not to come the invitation was there she declined. \n\nSo NTA on that front \n\nBut you are putting down her hobbies a little to much unless she's doing the same with you I can understand but other wise you need to stop. But he saying you abandoned her is very hurtful because you ask her to come. She didn't need to do the activity but she could have come.\n\nThe YTAs her are upset that there hobbies got called old people things. Guess what a lot of old people have these hobbies that's why there viewed as old people thing. I like doing a mix of all of these hobbies.", "With this kind of attitude, I won\u2019t be surprised to see a future AITA post involving OP\u2019s children upset with him for leaving their mom for a 28 year old who went scuba diving with him and is with him because she loves him - not because he\u2019ll die and she can enjoy the rest of her life from his life insurance. \n\n\u201cAITA for insisting my grown kids respect their new stepmom?

That is that many women in their 60s have decided to give up skiing and are stopping their husbands going skiing.\nI have seen it in my own ski club that nearly all the older ladies have decided to stop skiing. Their husbands are still coming but less as some find they have to go to warmer climates in the winter.", "INFO: have you tried joining her in any of her new interests?

Making him stay behind and give those things up because you can\u2019t do them anymore is unfair.", "NTA\n\nYou might want to point out to her that the reason she lacks energy (assuming no physical, mental health, or diet issues involved) is because she's too sedentary. Tell her that to get fitter (i.e. become more energetic) she needs to get off her arse and do regular exercise.  She's far too young to spiral into laziness and she's missing out. \n\nYes, grandchild time is very important - but so is regular exercise, maintaining mobility, flexibility and strength. And as she gets older, it's even more important to be active. It helps prevent injury and mobility issues.", "YTA I would never take a separate vacation from my spouse.

I hate sitting at home being lazy, or lying infront of the tv. My wife on the other hand, I have to literally beg her to get out of the house. So I go mountain biking, ride my e-skateboard and go on hikes. When I was younger it used to bother me when I left her alone, not anymore. She doesn\u2019t complain when I go out for outdoor stuff, and I don\u2019t complain when she stays on bed till noon with a book. A few years ago I did a BDR on the motorcycle on my own. Was a week long trip. No point in putting your life on hold just to please someone else. She can join, or not. Should not stop you from having fun. She gets joy out of her hobbies, you get joy out of yours. Just like she will not like if you deny her, she has no right to deny you.", "Sounds like she has depression or something similar possibly?", "Yeah I agree NTA but calling it being \u201clike a potato\u201d was asking for trouble. You both have valid hobbies you enjoy and different ways of engaging with the grandkids. Especially given your age difference, agreed that the \u201cold people shit\u201d comment was also unnecessary. \n\nI get that you\u2019re taking a lighthearted, humorous  approach, but that\u2019s not an effective way to actually resolve conflict when her concern isn\u2019t petty (even if it\u2019s unjustified); it comes from a feeling of insecurity and feeling left out.\n\nMaybe sit down and reassure her that you don\u2019t resent her and you want her to feel included, but you\u2019re planning to continue to enjoy these years the way you have been, and you don\u2019t want resentment to build. Taking a long vacation like that without her with no real scheduling conflict or other incentive is a little unconventional, but not wrong. A compromise would have been her coming along, enjoying a vacation doing more sedentary activities during the day, and spending time together during the evenings. But she chose to stay home.", "I want to say NTA but it sure feels like there's information missing here. 60 years is not an age where a healthy woman should be feeling like they have no energy and significantly decreased interest in activities they used to enjoy.\n\nIt seems like something else may be going on - maybe feeling like her own interests aren't respected and that husband is more about 'my interests count and yours are for old people', or maybe she's not enjoying being around husband so much for other reasons. Or maybe there are health issues here. But I don't buy that this is 'old people stuff' versus however the OP classifies his own interests.", "I love gardening and reading to and always have. But I've identified as a senior since childhood.", "Agreed. She could have also counter offered another vacation idea but she instead chose to spend more time home with the grandkids which is her right. But then she can\u2019t complain about her choice later if she later regrets skipping a nice vacation", "I think everyone is focusing on his \"old people\" comment instead of the fact that his wife attacked him for going.

I'm not saying you shouldn't be your own person at all. I'm always independent from my partner, but you have to plan overlap if you want things to work.

And without being judgmental of you or anyone else who's had struggles with physical changes I can only say that this is not the case for all of us. Some of that is likely genetics, some of it is a roll of the dice, some of it may be diet/exercise/factors as yet unexplained. I'm just trying to say that it's not unreasonable to think that a 60 year old woman should still feel fully engaged in the things she has always loved.\n\nMostly I find that folks are very condescending once women get past middle age and are all too ready to write us off as somehow decrepit or mentally deficient. It's a very ageist society and the guy who wrote the OP is a TAD too quick to trivialize and dismiss what is going on with his wife as 'old people stuff'.", "She is 60, he is 54 and she is 6 years older.", "He compromised with his wife on the ski vacation with her going shopping.

What she actually told OP was that she wanted to stay home and help with the Grandkids. If that's not what she really wanted, then that's on her for not communicating properly.", "But she is being a burden. \n\nNot because she stopped to be active, but because she wants him to stop being active too, and being bitter when he refuses.\n\nHe seems to offer her compromises, so it is probably not on him.", "Hes ah for his wording but not for doing the things he wants to do\n\n>Do you even like your wife?\n\nWhat does this have to do anything", "They are together for so many years.

The woman clearly was active... skiing, scuba diving.. She doesn't sound like a couch potato.\n\nI agree he's trivialising things and personally I think he's a prick for going on holiday without her but it's fine for her to decide she no longer wants to take part in high risk activities. Regardless of her age.", "Yes I read that part. An excuse like that means something is monumentally wrong in their relationship. He said some things that are probably a lot worse than doing old people stuff. \n\nNo it's not necessarily the same deal because it would depend on where in the Caribbean they go. Like it might be cheaper for him to stay in a dive where there's nothing going on versus going to a resort area where she would have more relaxing things to do. And some of those relaxing things could be eating exotic food and dancing.\n\nOne thing that I experienced recently was for a while taking medication that made me feel hot all the time. That made me not want to go somewhere that's hot and I normally love hundred degree plus weather. Maybe she's taking a medication that's making her either tired or hot and that's why she doesn't want to go. She probably told him about it before and he disregarded her. Whatever is happening I would not take this guy at face value not one iota. Something really smells.", "I just don't buy it something's wrong. This doesn't sound like a normal thing to say. On either of their parts. He must have done more than this to either insult her or she's becoming infirm and he's not dealing with it.

There's something wrong with the picture it all just sounds improbable.", "\"This summer she didn't want to come down to the Carribean to go scuba diving.

Any time my MIL wants to hang out with her grandkids he intentionally double books them because he can\u2019t handle that the grandkids are getting attention instead of him.

Sometimes it is just them.", "Yeah, I think you're reading it wrong.  Where in that paragraph are you getting the idea that she wanted to help out with the grandkids \"first\"?  She wanted to help \"more\".\n\nNow, \"more\" could either mean that she wanted to help more than she had been, or that she wanted to help more than she wanted to go to the Caribbean.  But that is very different than a timeline issue.", "Interesting. My take was she did not want to go AT ALL (OP did not say anything relating to the timeline), and that his compromise was \"I'd love to spend time with you, come with me\".\n\nGiving up his holiday he was looking forward to does not seem to me a happy solution. It might mean he would never be able to do things he loves.  It would make me resent her.", "What I said or what they said?", "I'm asking why him liking his wife is even relevant here.  Why is it a part of your statement?  Why are you deflecting?", "I can understand your fact but I don't feel like that's the case here. I mean she used to go with him and due to age could not or maybe due to her mindset. He should not have judged what she does so he is an AH for that. But she also should not have felt upset after declining to go on a trip after she explicitly said she doesn't want to come. That's double standards. I feel like maybe the wife doesn't like his husband.", "Because she didn\u2019t want to go. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t go on vacations together.
