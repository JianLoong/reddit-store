That is childish and selfish. A wedding is actually about more than the two of you, it\u2019s about two whole families and extended families and friendship groups all coming together in new ways. As the bride and groom, you are the center of that, and I guess I think you should have held your temper and frustration until the guests could wind down the evening and go home, and Jacob and Chloe leave.
