It\u2019s unclear from what you wrote what happened with the proposal.

I\u2019d be very upset, too, at this spectacle happening at my wedding after I said no to it. I understand why you would not want it to happen. It seems that your husband may never have told Jacob that you didn\u2019t want it. Jacob may well think you were on board completely. This is your husband\u2019s fault and he\u2019s a massive AH to have facilitated it while knowing how you felt. The only reason I say you too are YTA is that you left and shut down the reception. That is childish and selfish. A wedding is actually about more than the two of you, it\u2019s about two whole families and extended families and friendship groups all coming together in new ways. As the bride and groom, you are the center of that, and I guess I think you should have held your temper and frustration until the guests could wind down the evening and go home, and Jacob and Chloe leave. Instead, you had a full on meltdown, and have ensured that whenever anyone thinks about your wedding, that reaction of yours will be what they\u2019ll remember. Everyone will feel bad for all time when they think of your wedding. You certainly gave up the high ground.

It was gross of his friend to ask to begin with, and my guess is your husband said yes without asking you, and then got stuck in a bad spot when you said no.
