Anyone who uses the term beta male probably is\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA.", "Wow, they sure turned into snowflakes when you told them you didn\u2019t want to live with them anymore.", "No, thank god you found out before hand . A year is a really long time to be stuck with immature assailed like that.", "NTA. As a young woman, you need to make decisions that keep you safe. I lived with men in my early 20s. It did not end well. Had I drawn a line in the sand when they said asshole things I would have been spared a lot of trauma. You have dodged a major bullet. And also - consider distancing yourself from people who question you when you set boundaries. Talking about potentially signing a lease is in no way a binding contract. In fact not even a lease is.  Who you live with is a major decision, anything, and I mean anything, that makes you think it won't be safe is a good enough reason to choose something else.", "You were NTA. You were sensible and showed great discrimination.\n\nApart from anything else, men who have this attitude towards women are almost certain to expect a woman living with them to pick up all the housework etc. It would not be fun living with them.", ">A dark joke in good taste at the right moment is hilarious, but there\u2019s a difference between dark humor and just straight up being an asshole to people.\n\nYep.\n\nYou signed nothing. You owe them nothing. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you hosted a party, you ask them to shut the f up on the jokes.  they did not.  Who would want to be in a year long lease with them.", "given that you're a queer woman, they really shouldn't have expected you to be tolerant of misogynistic \"jokes\" (read: literally just hate)\n\nNTA", "NTA!!!\n\nYou hadn't entered into a lease with them yet so you are in the clear \ud83d\udc4d just happy that you saw their true selves before you moved in", "NTA- I am a fan of dark humor or edgy humor. However, know your audience. Also, this is a place you have to live in, so if you're not comfortable then I say you do right by you.", "NTA. It\u2019s dangerous being around people like that because slowly their shit will diffuse in your brain and you will start thinking and speaking like that. You did the mature and respectful thing  ending it and telling them up front. Fuck their snow flake bullshit, you will find good friends soon \ud83d\udc4d", "It sounds to me like they are terrible and that you dodged an incredibly misogynistic bullet. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA, protect yourself", "They sound miserable.  \nSo glad you found that out before moving in with them! \nThey sound like they would be the kind of guys expecting you to hook up with them, competing over it, and then saying feminism is to blame for their lack of success.", "Major red flags all over the place. You definitely dodged a bullet. These are the kind of guys that would say \"I didn't rape her, she was asking for it!\". Erase their contact info and tell the friends that are defending these idiots that you prefer to live in a safe environment  (if they hate on women so much who knows what they are truly capable of) and keep your integrity. Behaving like assholes has consequences. They are big boys, they'll figure it out. \n\nCongratulations on the close escape.", "NTA and do not under any circumstances move in with these dudes. When people show you who they are, *believe them.*", "But it wasn\u2019t even in the form of a joke? They just started talking shit about women.", "NTA. They left you. They made the environment unlivable and imhostile. Your \u201cfriends\u201d taking their side need to be cut from your herd, too. They\u2019re talking about you the same way when you\u2019re not around. \n\nIf you remain with them others will assume you\u2019re fine with their actions, so you\u2019ll lose out on those friendships too.", "Why would you want to live with those evil beasts? Nasty people they are.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nBut this thread is awesome. It's a reminder of how many commenters can remember every bad action from supporters of the other political party...while appearing to remain 100% incapable of recognizing the exact same behavior in their own party.\n\nWith sincere smugness, a member\\\\supporter of neither of those parties.", "NTA and they sound manipulative and abusive. They also reek of insecurity for how they acted at the party.\n\nIf you had actually allowed them to pressure you into living with them after how they behaved imagine how much worse things could have got. I could see that becoming a very dark living situation, and that\u2019s coming from experience living in shitholes with bad room mates", "NTA.  And stop being friends with them.  They're not your friends, so stop trying to be theirs.", "NTA they behaved like pigs.", "While I think people get offended too easily, you still shouldn't move in with people you don't think you will get along with or enjoy being around. Snowflake or not still NTA.", "Bingo", "Along with boosting their egos daily, of her own free will. Potentially cooking ALL the meals, because of her gender.", "Plus repairing anything that needs repairing, because lesbians have tools, amirite? /s\n\nI'd be surprised if those guys would have done anything around the house at all.

Taken to trial! \ud83e\udd18", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, those \u201cfriends\u201d sound like liabilities, and I can only imagine what kind of trouble they\u2019ll drag you into behaving like that around other people. You know what they say\u2014 birds of a feather flock together.", "NTA, you'd be sorry if you ended up stuck in a lease with these guys. Good thing you knew before you signed!", "Nta. You sound like a good person. They clearly are not.", "NTA. You saw their true colors before it was too late. They don\u2019t seem like people worth having in your life if they\u2019re going to be that vile", "NTA.", "NTA. You need to look after yourself. If you were uncomfortable with the guys after one party, just imagine how uncomfortable you would be living with them. Yeah, it sucks they got stood up on the place to live, but it's still better for you that you saw in time what they were like.", "NTA - you guys have different values. It wouldn\u2019t have worked out.", "NTA. They showed their true colours of toxic masculinity. If you did move in with them, you could probably expect them to tell you you should be making them sandwiches and doing the housework because, \"That's women's work!!\" \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e", "NTA. You dodged a bullet. If you had lived with them, it wouldn't surprise me to find them expecting you to do more of the housework in communal areas.", "NTA. If that\u2019s how they treat women from afar, I don\u2019t want to know how they treat women in person. That\u2019s the kind of dude you don\u2019t want to share a roof with.", "NTA thank God this happened before you actually signed the lease. Firstly, the \"jokes\" are pure trash but even their reaction to you backing out is a huge red flag. You dodged a bullet.", "You\u2019re a gay woman, how can you even expect to feel safe living with a bunch of conservative men?", "Dodged the proverbial bullet!", "NTA.\n\nThey fucked around.  You found them out. Screw them.", "NTA - misogyny sucks", "NTA\n\n\"Yes, I'm a snowflake, because your AH hot air melting the friendship I knew with you. What was left, I can't live with\"\n\nBut, I like to be a petty AH at times", "Telling on yourself. You think everyone sucks when it\u2019s just\u2026", "Ha! A neighbor recently made an \u201cinnocuous\u201d side comment about Dixie Chicks and I said I never heard of them until the controversy (opposing absurd Iraq war). And immediately bought their CD in solidarity.\n\nThank god Dixie Chicks was a canary in the country music scene as the response was filled with all sorts of racist responses.", "Honestly, the SP never really ended. There are still people who think that things like rock music, and Dungeons & Dragons are \"of the Devil.\"", "They were breakin the law", "NTA. They are awful and I shudder to think what living there would become like.", "I'm really kinda a lot proud of you for having a \"Oh, hell no\" moment. You don't have to live with them, talk to them, be around them... I don't know where they got the audacity, but I'm glad you found your moment to tell them to take their lease and shove it.", "NTA you are being a responsible adult by not wanting to associate with disrespectful immature adults", "Well, well, well.

Those types don\u2019t grow up and they don\u2019t get better, only worse.", "NTA \nMen need to be called out for their shitty behavior, and you deserve to live somewhere where you are comfortable and safe. I am currently in a similar living situation where I will be moving into a rental with 4 guys, and I would never do that without being 100% sure I can trust and vibe with them. \n\nIf that\u2019s what they are comfortable saying to/around strangers, what do they say behind closed doors? Probably a lot worse, I think you dodged a bullet", "NTA and frankly you dodged a bullet. I can\u2019t imagine living with that for a year. Good for you.", "Nah, fuck those dudes. NTA", "NTA.  They showed you their True Selves.  You didn't care for what you saw.  If they were so  worried about getting you on the lease, they could have kept pretending to be decent guys for a few more weeks.  Congrats, you taught them a valuable lesson for their future gaslighting purposes.", "NTA\nYou saw who these men really are and what they really think of women.

OP doesn't want to live with morons who start yelling about \"fat bitches\" and stupid people on here just can't fathom what the big deal is? The frat bro dudes are stupid. It's not about the rest of us being precious, but that intelligent people don't just call strangers \"fat bitches.\" If I have to explain further, there's no point; you're stupid.", "Or, they can eat a bag of dicks?", "The whiney right has been boycotting things for decades.", "Yeah, and it was just an image of the moon and stars.
