Ex and i are friendly and living together has been emotionally tolling but doable. My current lease ends in august. I asked a few guy friends of mine if they\u2019d be interested in taking me in as their third roommate for the next lease period. They agreed and we toured some spots around town.

Didn\u2019t even say hi, just walked in and started saying a bunch of very rude and wrong things about our neighbors. I was embarrassed because they\u2019re my \u201cfriends\u201d and i had people i invited that did not know them. I called them out and said something along the lines of that\u2019s enough, you\u2019re being an asshole, etc. They proceeded to continue making misogynistic jokes and call me a \u201cliberal\u201d for the remainder of their time there. \n\nThe next day i went over to their house and told them i would be living with my Ex and Bestfriend instead. They got upset at me saying that we were about to sign the lease and now they have to find an affordable place for just the two of them.

I told them it seemed like i never knew them and that it showed me a side of them i didn\u2019t want to live with. \n\nNow they\u2019re absolutely ballistic about this.
