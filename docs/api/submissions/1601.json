Unfortunately for me, all of us live in the same locality, and know a lot of the same people. Which inevitably has resulted in a lot of embarassing moments and situations for me. \n\nYesterday, it was my cousins' birthday party (their birthday falls on the same day coincidentally, so my aunt throws a joint birthday party) and a big hall was booked for a massive celebration. One of them was turning 2 and the other, 9. Now I love my cousins, and love spending time with them. But I always avoid parties and events where my family is going to be. Especially when I know a lot of the people that live around us are going to be attending. Everytime I've attended an event with my family, they've embarrassed the hell out of me. They end up forcing me to dance, click pictures with them (this goes on for an hour), my dad chastises me about my hair and keeps tucking it behind my ears because \"he likes it better that way\", they treat me like a child, or something or the other that makes me, a grown ass 20 year old want to bawl my eyes out because of how out of control I feel. \n\nAnyway, my parents kind of pushed me when they found out that I wasn't planning on attending, promising me that they would leave me alone. After a couple days of continuous coaxing, I gave in and told them I'd attend. On the day of, I started regretting it immediately. As soon as we reached the venue, my dad started taking pictures and asking me to photograph him and my mom is various different poses. One thing you should know about my dad, he's crazy particular about photos and starts being mean when they don't come out in the way he wants them... A reason why no one in the family except my mom wants to take a photo with him or of him. It goes on for a long time and he starts being very rude. After snapping like a million photos of him, we sat back down. I was talking to a couple mutuals (that live in the same locality and know my cousins), when my mom loudly exclaims that there was a tattoo counter and I should go get a tattoo. I got flustered immediately, and said no thanks, it's for little kids. She just kept on going though and told me that I am still a kid when it comes to her and should get a tattoo. The grown ups around her started laughing, and I walked away, angry and embarrassed. After some time, my mom showed up again with a plate full of food, and told me I should eat. I told her I wasn't hungry yet, and would eat when I wish to. This led to her attempting to feed me. I started fuming, and had had enough. So I promptly left. I didn't say anything to anyone, because I knew it would result in them forcing me to stay. I just left. \n\nEver since that, my family including my aunt have dropped me texts, telling me that I overreacted and ruined the mood for everyone. I didn't even make a scene. But everyone's still mad at me.  \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1667720771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynjz96/aita_for_leaving_in_the_middle_of_a_kids_birthday/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the mood is based on you being humiliated, then it isnt  healthy envorment.  Do you have any chance of moving away and start new?", "NTA. Time for a serious boundary discussion with your parents. I get it, you are only 20 and still their kid, but it's time for your parents to respect you as an adult. It won't be easy for them or for you. Try to understand where they are coming from (you definitely will when you have kids), but also help them to understand where you are coming from. Actually writing them a letter may be best. You can have a clear head and say what you need to and they have to read it. Let them know you love them and appreciate them, but it's time for the next phase in the relationship. Mutual respect and boundaries. It can be a tough move.\n\nBtw, did they helicopter parent you?  If so, they have a lot of work to do in letting go.", "NTA. Your family has some things going on. \n\nDad is definitely not gracious about pics, but you did go along with it. Next time I would let him know you\u2019ll take 5 tops, and he can pick from there. Then it\u2019s his problem again. \n\nAs for mom, I\u2019m sure she is trying to help you feel included and \u201ccheer you up\u201d etc. She\u2019s not doing this in a healthy way by violating boundaries you are trying to put up. She\u2019s trying to mess with your ability to choose for yourself, and trying to replace it with something \u201cnice\u201d or \u201cfun\u201d. Coming from a good place but not staying healthy along the way.\n\nAs for the rest of the family harassing you afterwards: yikes. I\u2019d let them know to stop or get blocked.", "NTA. They said they would leave you alone. Then they pushed and pulled as much as they could as soon as you got there. \n\nLike another commenter said, it feels a lot like a relationship between a teenager and their parents. You need to be seen as an adult and they refuse to do that. It\u2019s annoying and frustrating. \n\nNTA.", "NTA Most families are embarrassing. And most embarrassing families are easily embarrassed by the flight of random OPs. This is an irrefutable truth as revealed to me in the sacred comments of the subreddit known as AITA.\n\nBe warned. One day you will suddenly realize that you are lingering rather than fleeing. At that moment you should ask yourself: have I become one with the weird subculture that is my family? Or have they broken my spirit like a jalopy that's hit one too many potholes? \n\nIf it makes you feel better, my mom had a really loud voice and would sing-song \" I have to go wee-wee\" followed by batting her lashes exactly four times because she thought it made her more alluring to men. Did I mention that she had a weak bladder?\n\nEdit spelling", "NTA. You are under no obligation to submit yourself to anything you don\u2019t want to do regardless of who\u2019s asking/ inflicting it. You tried to give them the benefit of the doubt by attending, and they took for granted that you\u2019d put up with whatever they put you through. You were strong and I\u2019m proud of you for leaving when it got too much. They\u2019re upset you\u2019re not giving in to their unrealistic expectations of you anymore, which is on no one but them. \n  \nYou set clear expectations and we\u2019re ignored. They don\u2019t deserve your presence again until they prove they\u2019ll respect you as a person and the BARE MINIMUM you\u2019re asking of them. \n  \nStay strong, explain your reasoning (and know it\u2019s valid and reasonable), and make it clear what\u2019s required for them to be worth letting back in to your life. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do regardless of who\u2019s asking, so put yourself first and show them you\u2019re serious about asking for your worth and respect warranted. If they cause a scene, it\u2019s nothing to do with you and everything to do with them being upset they can\u2019t take advantage of you anymore. They\u2019ll get over it and maybe grow from it, but even if not, you\u2019ll feel a lot better taking care of you first like you deserve and won\u2019t waste your time uncomfortable to make others happy when they put you in that situation to begin with", "ESH\n\nDude ngl, your family sounds like a nightmare to me, I'm very introverted and would break down if somebody would constantly harrass me like this on public events.\n\nHowever. You could have pulled your mother aside and told her \"If you do not stop this right now I am leaving.\" You could have given her a warning. If she hadn't stopped, I would have left as well.\n\nBut this was a birthday party of your cousins and I'm sure they were very sad when they couldn't find you anymore. The least you could have done was make less of a scene and talk to the others.", "Honestly, from a first reading it feels like you are stuck up. You don't want to dance. Dont want to get tattoos with the kids cause you are \"a grown ass adult\"....\n\n\nAnd what? You cant dance? Be silly? Get silly tattoos at a children's party? It sounds like laughing about it is how your family deals with you acting like you are too old to be silly. Let go a little and learn to enjoy it. As someone older than you its very \"edgy teenager vibes\" seeing people be too old for silly dancing with children... \n\nYour dads photo taking is obnoxious but just set boundaries. \"im not doing it cause you are rude when wr help\"\n\nESH well... You and your dad anyway.", "NTA for leaving for feeling anxious, but honestly, what you\u2019ve described here sounds pretty normal for families. Do you have a counselor that you can talk to, and help work through why this stuff makes you so upset? And maybe work on being more confident, with the counselor. I can\u2019t tell your age, but this all sounds pretty normal (but maybe my view of normal is skewed)", "NTA. Your family is awful. Notice I didn't say they SOUND awful, they ARE awful! Next time, just say absolutely of course yes sure you'll be there, and then just hop on a bus and go somewhere else for the day and don't even answer your phone. Or, do answer your phone. Tell them you're on the way and you'll be there any minute. Keep doing this. Then when you know the whole party is over, go home. They will get on your back about it, and you just look all innocent and say, what? Nothing else. You will be calm and it will drive them crazy. Eventually, they will probably figure out that it is more trouble than it's worth to invite you to anything. As for your father and his photography fetish, I would love to see everybody in the family invade his home and relentlessly take pictures of him with their cell phones until he can't stand it anymore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If in future you want to go, state your boundaries or maybe talk to them outside of party setting", "NTA. They sound rude and demeaning. My dad\u2019s family was crazy and annoying, and actually rather awful once I got old enough to have my own opinions, but they wern\u2019t as rude as yours are behaving. I don\u2019t understand all the Y T A and E S H responses.

Your parents are AH, why spend any more time with them than you have to?", "ESH\n\nI get that family can be annoying, and your parents sound like they are overbearing and don't listen to you on the simplest things. Your dad sounds like an AH for being so particular about a photo, sounds like he's more concerned what other people will think of the photos than actually enjoying the moment. \n\nHowever it's a kids party, they're not the assholes, they just want to celebrate their birthdays, and you sound a bit high and mighty by saying you refuse to dance, interact with the kids activities etc. I'm in my thirties and childless, but when I go to a kids party I'm there doing the silly dances, getting my face painted like a unicorn and enjoying myself. \n\nYou need to let loose a little", "Nta for not wanting to go in the first place or wanting to leave when you were there. Yta for making a lil bit of a scene tho. You could\u2019ve just said, it was fun but I have to go now. Bye everyone. It\u2019s not that hard to act mature, you should try it.", "YTA. Everything you have described sounds typical of a loving (although can be a little bit annoying or intrusive) family. You should be thankful to have a family that cares for you. If it really bothers you that much, have a serious talk (I don\u2019t think the previous ones got into them) and lay down your boundaries as well as what the repercussion will be if they step on it. I think some form of banter is present in most families. It may just be the same with yours and your family may not be aware that it\u2019s getting to you personally already. \n\nIt\u2019s just amazing that simple things that usually happen in a family are now deemed as \u201cabuse\u201d, inequality, or obnoxious in the net. If we follow everything, every family member will have to tiptoe around every single thing that could potentially offend. \n\nI agree with your relatives. It\u2018s an overreaction. What they did doesn\u2019t seem proportional to the level of drama. I don\u2019t think leaving in the middle of the party is the main issue here. Try to introspect and find out what\u2019s really pushing your buttons - is it because you are not being recognized as an adult/ treated as a child? If so, how can you work on this with yourself and your family?", "Yeah, that's fair. I should have given her a warning to stop before leaving.", "It's not that. I love to dance. Just not with my family. Because it results in them passing comments that hurt. And I don't like getting tattoos. I didn't even get them when I was a kid at birthday parties.", "Read my comments to the other person. I love to dance.", "Wait, as I read the post, the warning was indeed given. Before the party. And they broke the promise to leave you alone.", "For example, what do theys ay that hurts?\n\nAnd the tattoo is to join with the kids. Its not for your pleasure", "\"don't dance like that, it's not flattering on you.\" Some casual body shaming follows. \n\nNo kid asked me to get a tattoo with them. My mom was the one pushing me. And no adult was standing in that line anyway. It was only the kids.", "Don\u2019t dance like that? Jeez. That is hurtful. I thought it was a little hard for you to call them obnoxious at first. Now I have to agree.", "I dunno...\n\nGet a tattoo\n\nNo it's for kids....\n\nIt still has that energy to it. I can see why they laughed.\n\nThe body shaming is not ok however.", "I don't see why I have to get a tattoo. No kid walked up to me and asked me to do it. If they wanted me to join, I'd have done it for them.", "To encourage the kids. If they see an adult doing it they will too.", "All the kids at the party were in the line to get a tattoo. I love parties, and I love kids. And I love to get silly with them. I just don't like my family treating me like a kid and passing comments.", "ive been to loads of children\u2019s parties and i\u2019ve only ever seen one adult get a tattoo, the kids always love to do it regardless of wether an adult has done it or not. Plus, the OP shouldn\u2019t be the one getting the tattoo to \u201cencourage the kids,\u201d surely it should be the kids parents?", "NTA grown ups have rules and boundaries. They keep stepping over yours and you need to enforce it. I would say for next time make a point of visiting each person who's having a birthday before the party give them a hug and well wishes and any presents. That way they know you care. Skip the parties. And let them know why. If they want to be around you at a party they have to stick to your rules and boundaries or you leave. If they don't want to adult you do not have to accept it."]}
