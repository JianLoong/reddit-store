I\u2019m not sorry about that and neither is anyone else. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nAnybody using cheques in this fay and age with actual proper digital options that are free and come with digital tracking is an asshole.\n\nYou are using way outdated tech and honestly need to get with the times. Barely anybody here used then for anything these days. One bank is even going to stop giving out cheque books with new accounts", "Zelle is incredibly easy to use and quite safe, and there is a record of all transfers.", "I have sympathy for your ex here because I'm a consultant for nonprofit organizations and a lot of them insist on paying me by check because they think it's somehow \"more secure\" or \"better financial controls.\" Hint: it's not. This is the 21st century and mailing paper checks is the least secure method of payment, and the most inconvenient. \n\nAfter I lost a $50 payment because the check was stolen from my mailbox and cashed by the thief, and my client refused to file a report with their bank, I started requiring my clients who wanted to pay me by check to take a picture of the front of the check and email it to me instead of sending it by snail mail. At least that way it doesn't get stolen and I can deposit it from my phone app. I suppose if you continue to refuse to use modern banking methods, you could offer that to your ex as a compromise.", "YTA, mostly. This feels like a combo of malicious compliance and/or a failure to understand banking. I think it's mostly the former, tho. Stop being petty.", "YTA, you are making this purposely difficult. A direct deposit shows proof that it was quite literally, direct deposited. That being said, nothing wrong with paying by check. But your reasoning for that is faulty. Also by the way, you can use \u201cthey\u201d instead of \u201chis/her\u201d and \u201cs/he\u201d.", "Are you sure you're not my ex son in law?\n\nIf not then this is kind of neither a-hole or not, just a personal preference.\n\nIf you are my former son in law then you've left a huge part of the story out and have been trying to screw over my daughter with this check nonsense by never sending it on time. You'd be the a-hole.", "I literally don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s deposited into the account. How is this an a*hole move?", "All banks literally scan checks in order to cash them, so all you would have to do is ask your bank for proof your checks were cashed and it shows the back of the check, which shows where it was deposited/cashed. YTA and doing to much.", "Info: .... What?", "INFO\n\nHow does depositing money to someone\u2019s account give them the ability to drain yours?", "Can't you hand the check to her when picking up your kids?  More importantly, if she's gonna be traveling, she needs someone to pick up her mail and deposit the check", "Yes OP. YTA! \n\nYou are purposefully choosing the most inconvenient method to be paying your ex the child support she needs/ is required to care for your child. \n\nYour excuses are just a load of BS that you are using in order to substantiate your continuity for being petty. \n\nIf you pay her by check, as opposed to through a third party/ state agency whom is required to protect your information in that manner, you are quite literally giving her the information to your account and routing number; they are printed at the bottom of each check. Most states have websites that 100% protect that info from ex spouses obtaining that information for that very reason. \n\nThere are thousands of parents who owe spouses in back pay for child support. Which is why we have mandates and laws for garnishing salaries in some states. Honestly OP, do better. Don\u2019t just teeter on the edge of being a little better than those guys; but actually do better. \n\nDon\u2019t make your kid suffer the consequences of his mother falling behind on bills because you\u2019re petty. Love your kid more than you hate your ex. \n\nJust lame and gross \ud83e\udd22", "Reasons you may be an asshole haha", "The only reason I would use this payment method is that I was being an asshole on purpose. Its inconvenient for everybody involved", "Reminds me of James Acaster's stand up about how only men say  \"he or she\" like they forgot women exist. \"he... OR SHE\" while women say they", "You can take a picture with your phone to deposit a check these days.", "I wouldn\u2019t quite call OPs justification reasonable. I think it\u2019s incredibly stupid. Not malicious or anything, just stupid.", "Are you telling the spouse that they can go to court because it sounds like op has been doing the same thing from the beginning and it\u2019s the spouse that wants a change. Not op\u2019s problem to make it easier on them if it\u2019s the way OP likes to do it.  They get the money at the right time and they can have someone else deposit for them if they aren\u2019t around to get there mail.  Having to change a normal routine because someone else feels inconvenienced is not part of the court order I assume.", "It\u2019s alimony not child support", "This is just wrong. Around here (Europe), all bank transfers show the account number of the sender, along with their name. Which is fantastic, because if you pay to an account and have the wrong name, the transfer will fail.\n\nDo not make statements which you don't know are true or false.", "See here\u2019s the difference between people older and younger than 25 or something.  You don\u2019t know how checks work and I hate dealing with transfers on a cpu.", "Im getting a vibe that this whole thing is because he wants to control what little part of her life he has left.", "Then why did he provide his reasons for paying by cheque?", "Bill pay service is what banks do. They generate checks from checking accounts, and definitely have routing info on them", "Sure, but that doesn't make OP an AH.", "How is that his problem? If the ex\u2019s only income is his alimony that\u2019s a her problem not a him problem.", "If you're sending a cheque, that has your account number on it too.", "Australia here and we have an option to pay child support through Centrelink but ad for the account info, last time I received a direct deposit it only showed the senders name because I had them saved in my payee list and the time before that it didn't show the entire details.", "Bank transfers/ direct wire transfers are a totally different type of transaction versus setting up auto pay through your bank account. Not sure how they do child support in your part of Europe but in the US, the government acts as a middle man to facilitate payment. There\u2019s usually a third party state agency/ website you can set this up through with zero issues of your ex spouse gaining access to your account. \n\nAlso, if your sending her checks, wouldn\u2019t that be worse?! Your account & routing number are literally at the bottom of every check. SMH. This is just another BS excuse on OPs end.\n\nQuit fear-mongering this guy into justifying making his ex\u2019s life difficult in not paying her. \n\nBTW OP, yes YTA if you continue to use these cheap baseless excuses to not pay your ex wife and thus, child- the aid she needs in order to maintain basic necessities for your child. Don\u2019t make excuses a deadbeat would. \n\nMy ex has gone over a year without paying any child support. And stories like this are the reason why states make that mandates they do. Quit making life harder for your ex and your kid. Do better. Love you kid more than you hate your ex.", "That makes no sense.  Why would your bank share your account number with someone you're paying? That's seems to put you at risk. Here in the states we have an electronic bank wire program called zelle. As long as your bank participates I don't even need to know YOUR account number to send you money.  As long as I have your phone number I can put money in your account instantly.", "Okay so then let me clarify.  Complaining about how an ex finances your life if an asshole move.  Especially because that person is paying you within the agreed upon terms of the court order.  So OP is doubly not an asshole.", "Alimony is bs and any person who accepts it is an asshole that deserves to have it as difficult as possible.", "Alimony shouldn\u2019t even exist, so\u2026.", "Why are people assuming OP is a man and ex is a woman?", "His ex is the asshole for accepting alimony. Anyone who expects another person to continue paying them for living expenses after they are no longer together, is a major asshole.", "Unless he\u2019s using something less convenient to be an asshole", "It's over used in some countries, but it has a reason to exist. For example, if someone wants a stay at home wife or husband, leading their spouse to leave the workforce, and then cheats on them or becomes abusive, the spouse should be compensated for the losses of not having a career.", "Sure, being an asshole would make him an asshole, but there's nothing inherently assholish about using a payment service.\n\nCashing checks can be done with a banking app these days. If he wanted to be extra nice to his ex, he could pay the next couple months early, but he's in no way obligated to. It on her to manage her finances suck that not being able to access her mailbox for two months isn't going to be a problem for her.", "They have been outdated for about 25 fucking years dude.\n\nWhat century are you living in.\n\nI've worked in finance, they are a massive pain in the ass for the person writing them and the person getting them.\n\nYou do know it can all be done digitally now much easier and simpler", "He\u2019s paying through a service - so it\u2019s the services bank account and touting info, not OPs.", "Cheques have your account number on them as well.", "Well if it\u2019s true that his method made money arrive to them late then what you\u2019ve said isn\u2019t true", "Depending on the service used that is probably not be true.\n\nI deal with checks every day at a bank.  The majority of bill pay service checks that I see are just auto printed checks with the payers original router and account number on them.", "Payment services are very reliable, because they have to be. I think it's virtually certain that the check didn't actually arrive late, but that she didn't get it from her mailbox when it arrived.", "It is everywhere except in the US.

Not privately, not in a business context.\n\nI think my parents used them sometimes when I was a little kid.", "Still, apparently crazy ex can\u2019t argue that if it\u2019s wired to the bank directly on the date so potentially more inconvenient for him too lol", "It's definitely easier to do via an electronic transaction, and also doesn't cost anything, but if OP is more comfortable with the bill pay service and proof that the check has been cashed, that's completely his prerogative."]}
