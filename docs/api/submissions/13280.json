Just because you have an automated direct deposit it doesn't mean your ex has access to your account. Also, all direct deposits are recorded by the bank so you still have proof of payment. It is actually safer and more secure to pay electronically than by snail mail.

You don\u2019t seem to understand how banking works. \n\nYou depositing money into their account via direct debit will create automatic records of the payment which you can see on your bank statement at any time of your choosing and can be verified by your ex\u2019s bank at any time. This process in no way gives your ex access to your account or the ability to take additional money other than the set amount specified in your direct debit.\n\nI\u2019m not in the US but I\u2019d be dumbfounded if it worked differently there.\n\nYTA for taking such an attitude without understanding what you\u2019re talking about. Of course it\u2019s inconvenient af to cash a check even if you weren\u2019t going to be travelling.", "NAH - your ex just wants their money more available and you want proof/unlinked accounts. \n\nYou do not need linked accounts to transfer money to someone\u2019s bank account to bank account. In fact, it has more proof than if you were sharing an account and depositing, because it might not always  differentiate between who pulls from it and who deposited it. \n\nWith a bank transfer, you have hard evidence of the transfer, the amount, the date, and who it went to.", "If you are worried about your ex getting your bank info and stealing from you, you're making it easier by mailing them a check with your account and routing number on it", "Not really, but why not? You still have a record, bank transfers does not mean she has access to your account. At least do it while she\u2019s traveling, a little goes along way. I suspect there\u2019s something else going on because your logic is a bit flawed.", "NTA.  I still use checks", "NTA.  You could also request to pay the money into the register of the court.  S/he would then need to present receipts to the court to show the money was spent on your child(ren).  As for it being late, you have no control over the postal service.

I'm sure it could still be done with DD/wire but whatever is most comfortable to you, that's the best. Don't change your method of payment unless directed by the court.", "NAH. You are SMART! Don\u2019t change for her convenience. You are accommodating enough by paying early. I\u2019d she is going to travel, she better figure out how to cash her check. Not your problem, as long as you deliver the check to her or her address (return receipt if you mail it) on time.", "NTA. You have valid concerns. It\u2019s not malicious compliance. She needs to be an adult and handle legal tender. Most banks allow you to cash a check just by taking a picture of it with the app. Don\u2019t even need to leave the house.", "NTA , pay any way you want to, as long as you pay.  However, I\u2019m amazed that Americans still use checks (or cheques where I\u2019m from).  Nobody has used them for over 20 years here.", "NAH I guess.", "It\u2019s your perogative. That said, you may want to check into this more. Depositing with a check gives her your full account number, bank\u2019s routing number, and your address. With those, she could absolutely steal from your account. For a direct deposit, she must provide *her* banking information to you. Both provide records, if done correctly.
