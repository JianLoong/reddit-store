She\u2019s freeloading and she wants to bring guests over? That\u2019s a privilege she did not earn while freeloading and creating a mess and expects you to clean up after them. Life is tough, she\u2019s not the first nor the last to realize that and what\u2019s not fair is her expecting you to help clean up her mess while freeloading.

Honestly this just speaks volumes as to why she's a single mom.", "NTA.\n\nYou're doing a lot for her, including (apparently) letting her live with you without paying anything for rent or utilities or food, and including letting her use your place to entertain her friends. That's very generous.\n\nYour insistence that she clean up the mess her child makes is very reasonable, and your 4-month deadline by which she has to move out is also generous, a lot more than most tenants would get.\n\nYou said:\n\n*My girlfriend and her sister live with me*\n\nWhen you say \"girlfriend\", do you mean your intimate partner, or just a friend who happens to be female?\n\nBecause you haven't said a word about what Girlfriend thinks about all this. She should really be the one laying down the law with her sister.\n\nEspecially so if Girlfriend is your partner, because what you have in that case is an in-law problem, and spouse/partner should always be the one to deal with their family so that you don't end up looking like the bad guy.", "NTA. I think it's really strange you have to act almost like a parent to your gf's sister AND her kid. Plus, you work 65+ hours while they trash your house while living rent free? \n\nAlso, since she is your gf's sister, I don't understand how your gf has not taken it upon herself to be firm to her sister about cleaning habits. You guys are doing her a favor so she can get back on her feet or was it agreed she could live with you indefinetely? I don't get how giving a dead line for her to at least find a job and an appartment that is manageable (In 4 months you should be able to find something and maybe even save up a bit so you can move would be asshole territory. \n\nYes, it might be an emotional time for her, but this might actually make her life a whole lot more tolerable. I know I needed a kick in the butt when living with my ex and once I moved out on my own, even tho it was hard at first as I had never lived on my own. It made me feel a lot more in controll of my life and happy in my environment not living in the past. To be clear, I was paying rent at my ex's tho. \n\nI think you did good establishing a timeline and staying firm. What would be an asshole behaviour would be to say 4 months, then say nevermind, then get pissed and evict her in an even shorter timeframe because you've had enough. Be firm, remind her once in a while, make sure she understands this is her occasion to find a job, save up and move on her own. It doesn't mean you can't babysit her kid from time to time, but it means you get your house back and she grows up.", "Life is hard... Well, what a surprise. I mean, you took away partially her financial problems and granted place to live in and she's still whining. If she's not like 18 or something then well, gotta start taking responsibilities someday. OP definitely NTA.", "NTA:\n\nShe should be doing more to show that your investment in her existence is appreciated.\n\nJust a thought. I've seen you post some pretty well thought out responses here. Maybe you should take the time to include them in a discussion with her and your girlfriend.  Not just privately with her, but with both of them. That should help keep misunderstandings from happening. \n\nQuote: Her kids an absolute delight and I don\u2019t wanna see her go, I just wanna stop tripping over toys while I go get water at 3am or sitting on my couch and finding 3 weeks of cookies saved up in the crevices.", "You have to decide are you a shelter or a person with a lodger. Right now you're giving free housing to an adult and her child, the longer that goes on, the worse things will get", "NTA. You work 65 hours a week. Your girlfriend's sister should have asked her to help her clean up around the house. You should not be expected to be the breadwinner and the housemaker. She made the child. The child is her responsibility. Your girlfriend should be helping her sister with the child if it is something that she is unable to deal with on her own. You did nothing wrong..", "NTA. I think it\u2019s reasonable to tell her to keep the house clean or move.", "YTA. You admit you were being mean. The way you spoke to her was horrible timing and you never would have worked anything out at that moment. If she\u2019s living with you, life is very hard. Taking care of a young child is a lot of work, and unpaid work that gets little respect. I understanf that it\u2019s not your child, but you let her move in with a little one, and that so it is now their home, morally and probably legally too. When everyone has cooled down, you should apologize for how you handled it and say that you want to make clear arrangements for cleaning, etc.\u2014and *maybe* when she might move out. \n\nWhat\u2019s your gf\u2019s role in all this?
