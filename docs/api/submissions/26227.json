You should be a lot firmer with both your 'employers' OP.", "If I\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019m not sure anything has been saved at all and it kinda sucks.

Your kid is atypical.\n\nSecond, more and more people (people currently in their 20s and 30s) are moving away from having dinner at their dining room table. Some people use their dining room table as their work desk and don't feel like moving all their work equipment just to eat dinner/breakfast, just to have to move it all back later. Some people like to watch TV while they eat so they sit on their couch.

If you give her a timeline, and make it very clear you are serious, maybe even put a calendar up or something with the day marked, then she might finally take it seriously. Is she getting child support? If not maybe your girlfriend could help her get a court order for that.

The only thing good for the child will be you fully supporting them.", "A homeless shelter will help her get back on track. You are doing her no favors at all with raising her child. What is is doing is teaching that child how to leech off of people if she can't even get it to pick up the toys and eat at the table, they will set boundaries at the shelter.", "If the mountain of crumbs is an indication, in this instance asking for the child not to eat while seated on the couch makes sense.\n\nAs a rule, children don't clean up for themselves, their parents do. If their parents aren't doing so, then the location of their snacking needs to be moved to a place where the mess can be contained.", "My 22 month is not potty trained (we have tried but he isn\u2019t interested and we aren\u2019t pushing him). But I fully expect him to not eat on the couch and I remind him every time he tries to bring food from his table to the adjoining living room/couch. I still have to remind him but is my job as his parent. It is the child\u2019s parent to do the same in OP\u2019s house. Either that, or clean it up every time.", "As of my comment time this is downvoted and I don\u2019t understand why.

He seems like my big boy now. I just meant that he has known to sit at the table when eating since he was younger (like 12 months).", "I'm not saying that it shouldn't be a rule. I'm saying OP needs to open their mouths and tell the parent that the kid needs to eat at the table. Nowhere in OP's post or comments does OP say that she told the kid or parent to stop eating on the couch. All that was told to the parent was to clean up after the kid.", "I'm struggling to even write this down, and sorry for bringing up some \"negative\" thoughts in advance, but IMHO she has to settle the legal father question for her child and at least have someone to responsible for child support even in paper.\n\nI'm not suggesting anything bad, but if they continue to rely on you too much, depending on your country/state (esp. in the US) you could end up the father figure legally for providing to the kid, binding you to pay the child support, eg. if you want to end this arrangement and she sues you in court. (It sounds absurd, but there are precedents for this)\n\nSame goes for living in your house, depending on the local laws they may became legal tenants after X days, impossible for you to evict them legally...\n\nI don't know how is the situation between you, but you must think about yourself too. I don't want you to stress about this, but it's good to prepare for everything even if things are looking good at the moment.

The courts will almost guaranteed not force a custody split when the child came about because of drugging and rape. How would that possibly be healthy for the kid?\n\nGoing after child support should be a bare minimum.", "Maybe just ask the lawyer (specialising in custody and family cases), how would it look, if the court knew about drugging and rape. Maybe in this case the custody wouldn't be given at all to father.", "The chances are he will want nothing to do with the baby and she will be lucky to get much support at all but she needs to do this, if you support her and the child long enough, I wonder she would ask the  courts to make you pay temp support when you kick them out, they will laugh in her face but yup, I can see her doing that.", "Op i hope your claiming them as dependents on your taxes as well!", "NTA. Why are you paying all the bills? Time for her and  her kid to leave.", "IMHO 4  months to move is generous .

What responsibilities does she have?  A toddler can help her clean, and think it a great game, not even knowing they are learning skills.  Did she even ask if it was okay for her to use your home for her guests?  Most people in such situations would be cooking and cleaning from gratitude for a place to stay.\n\n*She told me that \u201cit\u2019s not fair\u201d and that \u201cher life is so hard and she can\u2019t keep up with it all\u201d and pretty much started crying.*\n\nYeah, it's not fair.  **SHE isn't fair to you.  She's using you,** being supported by you, and thinks you should do even more for her.  When you object to putting out more and more, she manipulates you with her tears.  **Her reaction is extreme.**   Is she handicapped?  Ill?  Is she only watching a toddler all day and nothing else?  Most people staying home with kids are also doing the house and the food, as well as lots of other things. \n\n*What makes me feel like the asshole is the fact that while she was crying I told her that my point still stood* \n\nThis is a good thing.  You didn't let her manipulative tears manipulate you.  \n\n*and that if she couldn\u2019t change her act she could find a new place to live within the next 4 months.*  \n\n**It would be reasonable for you to change this to a month.**  She will claim it's not fair, probably find someone to help her blame you, and then when she can't, she will find a new victim to sponge off.  \n\n**I'd also make sure that all your most important things are locked down while she's still there.**  Any account numbers, paperwork dealing with finances or utilities, etc.  Get them secured where she cannot find them.  Lock your bedroom doors.  Be ready to upgrade your locks as soon as she's out of the house.  Angry users can sabotage your stuff, steal your stuff and expect no accountability.\n\n**Does your GF agree with this?**  You might have to kick all of them out, if she doesn't.  **Talk to a lawyer** for your area and see what the law says about your specific situation.   If you feel like your home is likely to be sabotaged, or you could be harmed in some way,  you might be able to kick them out with less advance notice.  **If you feel guilty about doing that, you can pay for a week at a weekly rental hotel for them**, to give them a place to transition.", "NTA", "Nta stop pay for them.

She's not even repaying your free room and board by taking care of her/her kid's mess - much less pitching in to help with cooking or general cleaning as a thank you. She pours on the waterworks because you - after NINE months - finally said she needed to do 1/2 of her job (cleanup after herself). You didn't even mention the other half - provide food and home for herself and her child.\n\nSo help her - get her an application for assisted housing. If she knows who the father of her child is, then tell her you will help her complete the paperwork for child support. If she doesn't know the father but can narrow it down, then she can consider doing a paternity test and pursuing child support after that. I won't be surprised if she balks at those steps and turns on more waterworks. Ask her what is her plan to get herself on her own feet in the next six months.
