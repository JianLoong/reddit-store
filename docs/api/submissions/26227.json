Sister shouldn't have 'friends over' if her life is 'so hard' that she can't clean up. Gf should be doing her own share of the household chores, as well.\n\nIf they can't consistently stick to the rules and a chore chart, then you need to ask the both of them to leave.", "NTA. If she has time to entertain, she has time to clean.", "She's living there rent free and can't even pick up after her own child?\nYou know you're NTA here, sounds like you support her a bit too much.", "She's way too comfortable at your place. NTA. I'd start charging her rent and do no more groceries for her. She's not making an effort, so why should you?", "Maybe total the cost of her existence in your life and ask yourself if that is money well spend. Or how many hours less you could work.\n\n Unless Im missing something, OP isnt getting anything out of this deal...", "Yup, sister should have a heart to heart with HER sister.  Cleanings a drag, dishes are a drag, hell, sometimes childcare is a drag.  An amazing amount can get done in 15 minutes at a time though.  If she can\u2019t spare 15 minutes to tidy up something\u2019s wrong.  OPs partner needs to step up in all this, she should be the one being asked to help tidy.  This might have been the dynamic through their childhood though, her sister\u2019s a slob, & she\u2019s done. NTA", "Maybe he wouldn't need to work 65 hours a week without a freeloading asshole in his home that doesn't even clear up after herself", "Wow.\n\nSo the lesson here is that you should never help out because then you will be an asshole for being upset over people not respecting your help? Great!\n\nBad timing? How about the sister lacking even a drop of self-awareness and trying to get OP to clean up her kid\u2019s mess again?\n\n\u201cIt is their house now, morally and legally\u201d\n\nJust\u2026 wow.", "I'd say my ADHD helps me clean, when i see a mess i forget what i am doing and immediately clean the mess lol", "Yes I nearly said compare it to an estimate for a cleaner for a kid free place", "Why is the kid eating on the couch? My own son knows he has to sit at the table to eat (he is 22 months and has known this since he was little). NTA but you need to set some boundaries/rules.", "Oh, this woman isn't  not going anywhere until you make her leave. I am 100% sure the fairy tale you have been told is that this woman and her child will live with you for free and subsidized with more money until she has saved up enough to move out. What is that number? How much has she saved so far? I promise you, it's not happening. She is not giving up this sweet deal without a big push out the door.", "\"I haven\u2019t had buddy\u2019s over in months bc IM embarrassed\"\n\nNext time she brings this up tell her that you already feel like you're being taken advantage of, that it's not just the money but that her and kid are having an impact of every aspect of your life and you're getting to your wit's end.\n\nBe prepared for her to manipulate your girlfriend onto her side, or at least paint you as a jerk.  I really hope you have a very clear deadline.  Do not renew your lease until she's gone.  It may take your leaving to change the dynamics and get a childfree space back.", "NTA, you sound like a pretty stand up guy. Maybe next time take a moment and write down your thoughts or think it through a bit more. Might allow for a more open conversation.", "I think she feels *too* welcome there though buddy. Does she have an end date to move out? You need to have a serious discussion and put a cap on this. She's treating your home like a frat house, and you like a maid/provider.\n\nCharge her. The free ride is over she should have a fire lit under her to get her out. The entitlement is absolutely bonkers here.", "Why are you paying for everything?\n\nDon\u2019t your GF and the sister work? \n\nIf you\u2019re paying for everything, including diapers, what the hell are they doing with their money?\n\nAnd if you come back with neither works, my follow up is what the hell are they doing all day if you have to come home and clean?", "But is she actually saving while she\u2019s there?  If she\u2019s just wasting her money I\u2019d definitely charge rent/bills etc\u2026. Even if you just do it until you have a set amount and then tell her she\u2019s got to move out and give it to her", "Is he not little anymore?", "At 22 months? He's practically ready to go start working in the factories."]}
