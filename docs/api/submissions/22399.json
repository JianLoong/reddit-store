We were in a serious relationship and genuinely loved each-other. \n\nA year into our relationship we had planned for our parents to meet( They we\u2019re both single parents) and they had hit it off quite well.\n\nThey had eventually started dating and that had took a toll onto mine and Nate\u2019s relationship, we both thought it was Weird and ruined the whole dynamic - so we broke it off.\n\nOur parents eventually got married and we were Happy for them. So to not ruin their relationship, me and Nate had agreed to keep the relations a secret.\n\nPutting that all behind us me and Nate had developed a good friendship.\n\nSo fast forward to now, i am now 25 and have met my fianc\u00e9- James(30). My mum and step dad really love James like their own but James ,for no reason, dislikes Nate. ( this dislike was before I had told him about the relationship).\n\nOne night me and james had gotten  a bit drunk ( not too much that I don\u2019t remember) and I had let it slip that me and Nate were once involved with each other. James quickly sobered up and walked away. The next morning i had reassured him that it was all behind us not and we only see ourself as friends( saying siblings was weird).\n\nThat day there was a big family dinner that we all go to at least once a week. The whole night James was making digs at Nate and constantly boasting about himself to put Nate down. After dinner we were all sat around talking and drinking. And all of a sudden James had said to Nate \u2018why aren\u2019t you in a relationship, is it because your still in-love with my wife?\u2019\n\nEveryone went quiet.\nNate and James included.\n\nNo one said anything for a good 2 mins and Nate looked alarmed. James had knew he messed up so excused us to leave. \n\nWe\u2019ve drove home and I haven\u2019t spoke to him since. I am now writing this from the guest room.

Girl, you can do so much better. NTA", "NTA\n\nBut you have bigger problems than James blurting out something he was told in confidence (not that I'm downplaying that . . . his untrustworthiness is still a big deal). At least this time he only told people who, thank goodness, were already aware of the situation. It's definitely a part of the bigger picture of James' not being someone you can count on or confide in safely, though, when he is supposed to be your future husband.\n\nThe bigger issue is that your 30-year-old fianc\u00e9 is so insecure that he's literally jealous of your high school boyfriend . . . a high school boyfriend who you mutually broke it off with (i.e. you BOTH CHOSE not to be together) when he de facto became your sibling.  Of all the situations where someone is not a threat to your relationship, this is one of the clearest. You may not use the word brother, but Nate is like a sibling-friend to you now. He's your family. And it's been that way for many years. \n\nBut a grown man in his 30s who is so insecure, so jealous of a relationship you had with a teenaged boy in high school, that he is making horrifyingly inappropriate statements at a family dinner, and angrily blurting out things you told him privately? That's not a man you can build a stable life with in the long run, unless he gets intensive therapy IMMEDIATELY to deal with his jealousy issues. That kind of irrational jealousy doesn't get better, it gets worse.\n\nI know you love James, but please think about this seriously. You are NTA to take some time to yourself to process his appalling behaviour and what it means about him as a person.", "ESH. You sound too immature to get married (not disclosing your relationship earlier and now giving the silent treatment instead of communicating). James for causing a scene. I wonder if he picked up on some vibes from Nate previously which led to disliking him. You only broke up because of your parents relationship so there could be lingering feelings there..", "ESH, I feel like there's more to the story. You and Nate only broke up because your parents started dating, James didn't like Nate from before he knew about your past...it makes me infer that maybe he saw something about Nate and you that he didn't like. \n\nThe fact that your relationship with Nate was somehow kept a secret for that whole year makes me wonder how well you've been able to continue keeping secrets. \n\nIdk something smells fishy about this whole story to me, maybe it's my own biases (I have been cheated on before). \n\nJames definitely was wrong with how he handled the situation, for sure.", "I just wonder why you didn't tell James beforehand, since there would be a chance he may find out later down the line(you \"accidentally telling him\"). \n\nBut to answer your question, I'd say \"NTA\", because James completely overreacted.\n\nAlso, I'm curious, you say he dislikes Nate \"for no reason\", but that's clearly not the case so imma need you to do some digging ma'am \ud83e\udd28 this scene wouldn't have happened if you hadn't said anything about you and Nate.", "I'm not sure how to judge this. On the one hand, James is completely out of order for the way that he behaved. But I don't think you made the situation any better by drunkenly letting it slip to him. I feel that this is something that you should've told James as soon as you became serious and not as a bit of salacious gossip when you were drunk. NTA for being pissed at James's childish behaviour though.", "I don't understand why your parents can't (and don't already) know you and Nate were a couple. You were together for a year in high school and they weren't aware of it? And if it was a secret for some reason then (like you weren't allowed to date yet or something), what is stopping you from coming clean about it now? It's actually kind of an adorable story; I'd embrace it!", "Esh, past dating history doesn't have to be disclosed. But it sure as heck does when it's with someone very close to you who and you will be dealing with for the foreseeable future. \n\nThink about why James hated Nate before he even knew about the past relationship... My guess is jealousy, why was he jealous? Do we know for a fact that Nate doesn't have any feelings for you? \n\nJames acted like a child but it  was in reaction to being blindsighted and I could imagine how shitty he felt knowing you two dated and you didn't tell him. \n\nIf you can't work through this like adults, you're probably not ready for a serious commitment. My advice to you, forget about how you feel for a second and try to understand how he felt, and hopefully he does the same thing and you come to an understanding of where you both went wrong and how to avoid such a mess in the future. I", "YTA, but so is James for causing a scene. Not telling ur SO that one of ur good friends used to be a serious relationship would be alarming to me. You said James didn't like him even when he didn't know..why is that?", "Nta but I still want some info. Why didn\u2019t you introduce your parents to each other and mention you and Nate were in a relationship. Like meeting the boyfriend/girlfriend family. I feel like all this could have been avoided if you just told them from the jump", "Claiming  you \"accidentally\" told James is an AH move.  It wasn't an accident, it was a poor decision, and it broke your agreement with Nate.  Punishing your partner with the silent treatment isn't the sign of a healthy relationship.  Between you and James ESH.", "Couldn\u2019t keep your word everything else past that was on you YTA", "He rightfully feels weird. I mean you and Nate are forever bonded with a pretty big and weird secret. And is Nate maybe a reasons why he and James dont get along? Maybe James sensed something is off because you and Nate have a deep bond. I also suspect alot of partners would be uncomfortable with this history in the family dynamics. James however did act really wrong, he probably internalized alot of feelings and seeing you and Nate toghether made then come out in a bad way. Still im going with YTA as this was something you guys should have talked more about or try to work out before putting him in the same room as Nate. He is going through a lot of emotions and thouhgts. If my partner told me she used to be madly in love with her step-bro but they broke up just because of the parents thing but are still heavily involved in eachothers live and bearing a secret toghether only you know of. I mean it is a breeding ground for insecurities to rise from unless worked on", "Esh you lied to your fianc\u00e9 for years and he reacted childish. You probably lived at home with Nate for years so now James is probably questioning if you were still sleeping together all that time and if that\u2019s why you lied.", "NTA but YTA at the same time\n\nYour husband deserved to know about this situation way before marriage.  How can he trust you going forward?  Hopefully he walks away, and you learn to be upfront about that mess of a situation you have going for you.  The fact that you kept it hidden from your husband screams that there are still residual feelings at a minimum, you also couldn't blame him for wondering if you've kept a relationship going with Nate behind his back for years.  That alone makes YTA.", "NTA. I think its a pretty amazing story how your highschool relationship led to two adults finding love. For your fianc\u00e9 to be so insecure is ridiculous, especially since Nate is your stepbrother and for your fianc\u00e9 to think anything shows his lack of trust and respect for you.", "YTA and once again all these n t a proves how hypocritical this sub is.", "NTA. This doesn't seem like something James will be able to accept and get over. And do you think you can spend your life with someone who does things like this? Putting someone else down to make themselves feel bigger and better? Maybe you should spend some time thinking about if James truly is the one.", "Nta. For being 30 years old, James is pretty immature. Break it off with him because he's going to isolate you from your family. You're going to end up avoiding the family dinners to make him happy and keep the peace. This is a red flag; don't let anyone control you like that.", "Esh don't keep secrets and he shouldn't of said anything", ">And I feel as now the whole friendship between me and Nate is going to be on rocky terms\n\nYour marriage should be on rocky terms. I have no idea why hubby is so insecure, but it was really uncool of him to act out like that.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure you can work things out to stay friends with Nate. \n\nBut James sounds like a huge insecure AH who will never get past this. Be glad he has shown you who he really is before you made the mistake of marrying him.", "What's with all the break-up comments? 1 bump in the road, and she should break up with him, lol. Fairweather.", "YTA for hiding things from your husband. Hiding it makes it look really bad. Then, telling him while drunk makes it worse. \n\nYou did this to yourself.", "NTA - it seems James may not be ready for a serious relationship at this point in his life, he seems to struggle with the concept that you have a previous dating history.", "NTA\nHe reacted like a kid. It's comprehensible that maybe he feels \"weird\" about this, but like you said, it's in the past and doesn't concern him at all. He's being a jerk, maybe because he feels insecure right now. \nThe best would be for him to ask forgiveness to your family and yourself and for you two to talk and try to figure out why he feels the need to brag about himself and destroy your friend", "NTA. But James sounds like a problem. Are you sure you want to marry him?", "NTA. You haven't done anything wrong and your fiance deserves to be in the doghouse for causing a scene with his insecurity.", "NTA, James is insecure.  good luck ever having male friends", "Your husband is an insecure AH..", "INFO: why were you worried the truth would \u201cruin their relationship\u201d and kept it a secret? I actually think it\u2019s a cute \u201chow our parents met\u201d story. \u201cOh, Nate and I used to date in high school and our parents met each other.\u201d \n\nNo offense to the high school sweethearts who get married (my parents were!), but it pretty uncommon for high school couples to be soulmates any more. They\u2019re serious relationships but they\u2019re very different than adult relationships, if that makes sense\u2026 \n\nIf my fianc\u00e9 was jealous of my high school bf I would think it ridiculous.

You need to figure this one out soon.  Obviously, your fianc\u00e9 has jealousy issues and doesn't seem very upset about hurting you as a result.  Is that someone you want in your life?
