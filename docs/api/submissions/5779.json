So OP should make sure anyone defending the cousin actually knows what happened before getting cutting these complainers out of his life. \n\nThere was a post not to long ago about a woman trying to accomodate her sister's BIL at Christmas dinner. (He was a last minute addition). He was a very picky eater and hated spices - only salt could used in his food. She was willing to cook him a seperate meal but that wasn't good enough for him. He tried to insist that no one could have any spices in their food. So he was uninvited. \n\nThe OP's BIL was misled about the conversation between his brother and the OP and went off on everyone for not making accommodations for his brother. He didn't realize his brother was trying to dictate no spices for the entire Christmas dinner.", "Her parents are probably amongst the ones demanding an apology from the OP.", "How is this any different to calling adoptive parents by mom/dad. OP has raised him since he was a newborn and he knows the truth anyway.", "Life must be hard being as smart as you", "You reminded me of this quote: [This is my family. I found it, all on my own. It's little, and broken, but still good. Yeah, still good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoVVQk7s6kg)", "Somebody didn't read the entire 3rd paragraph:\n\n>My brother calls me dad and i call him my son so from the outside people probably assume he has no clue im not his dad but thats not the case, he has always known that I am biologically his brother and that mum and dad had an accident so I became 2nd dad. He has known this all though his childhood.", "No", "Happy Cake Day!", "She is probably jealous of the respect you have garnered from the family for stepping up.", "Our moms are sisters? Cousins! Your \ndad just got married to my dad\u2019s sister? Cousins! You married my cousin? You\u2019re a cousin too! Our moms are best friends and you came over to my house every month while growing up to hang out and eat fried rice? Everybody\u2019s cousins! There\u2019s room for everybody at our table!\n\n(Metaphorically. Something the kids all got sent to the big coffee table in the living room to eat because the dining room table ran out of space but that\u2019s not the point here!)", "My best friend and i are like sisters, and I refer to her son as my nephew.\nThey are just as much a part of my family as my bio family.", "\u2764\u2764\u2764", "Somebody doesn\u2019t comprehend what they read. I posed a hypothetical \u201cwhat if\u201d and very clearly posed the statement as such by starting it with the words \u201cwhat if\u201d", "Obviously, you're part of my family.  HELLO COUSIN!", "Ass hats propose what ifs.  You read it. Or you didn't.  He clearly said his brother knows the difference.   What if ?? Are you six years old ?   What I'd the world ends tomorrow.  What if dinosaurs come back.  What If tomorrow you woke up and everyone was 1 foot shorter. \n\nWhat if?  How about you grow up.", "I concede to your point:\n\nIf things were different, they wouldn't be the same", "I wouldn't prompt him. But if OP had not intervened, I was trying to imagine what 7yo would say to cousin about it. Like explaining it to a clueless kid.\n\nRemember that 7yo has no memory of his birth parents, and he may have had to explain this to other kids at school or whatever.", "And every few years one of the kids starts to go wait, who are we actually related to? And that\u2019s when we have to grab a pen and start trying to figure it out. I literally learned at 25 that my uncle Larry was actually my godfather. How the hell is that not my dad\u2019s brother?\n\nAnyway, hey cousin!", "The 7 year old would probably just have stared at her. I doubt he would have said anything. She, in effect, jumped on the poor kid.", "It really depends on how she said it.  And whether the kid is naturally talkative and whether he knows cousin well enough to be comfortable talking.\n\nI can see it going like \"Did you know that OP is your brother and not your real dad?\" \n\nAnd he just says \"uh huh--and did you know my real mom and dad died in a car crash? And OP is my second dad and he loves me more than anything.\"", "If the grandparents had to tell her that the kid knows, he didn't say anything. Even if he didn't have time to say anything as his dad chucked her out, it wasn't her place. Nobody in their right mind would say that to a child. It's traumatic. Hey, that's not your dad?", "I'm not disagreeing with any of that. Is there somewhere in my posts that gives the impression that I thought what she did was acceptable?  My point is the yelling and screaming gave her the drama she craves.\n\nI would actually be very surprised if in THIS CASE it was traumatic AT ALL for the child.  He knows what happened to his birth parents.  He knows his \"dad\" is really his brother.  He knows that Grandma and Grandpa know.  The only thing he probably doesn't understand is why his cousin is just now figuring this out.", "You don't think it is traumatic for a child to hear, hey your mum and dad are dead and that's not your dad? If it wasn't traumatic why did his dad chuck her out?"]}
