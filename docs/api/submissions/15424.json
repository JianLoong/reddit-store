I think people are jumping over the part where your therapist allowed your husband to barge into your private session (??!!) and chat about their project during YOUR time.", "NTA. It seems you have two issues. Hubs disappeared for 12 hours without any explanation. Your therapist allowing \"shop talk\" with your husband in your session was not cool. I think your therapist was likely trying to ease your mind about your husband's whereabouts when she said she saw him at a work event. Overall, the mixing of husband's work and your therapist is clearly crossing boundaries you're not comfortable with. You need to be honest with your therapist and your husband, but only you can decide if it's worth giving up an amazing therapist over what is likely a temporary issue. Maybe tell your therapist you REALLY need her to respect that you need to keep the two worlds separate. Of course, she'll ask you why it bothers you so much. Is it that you don't trust her or your husband?", "NTA  Both your therapist and your husband are being unprofessional. Discussing a work project during your therapy session may have breached their work confidentiality rules and used time that you paid for to talk about non you things. \n\nAdditionally, your husband not telling you where he was for 12 hours was shady. \n\nYour therapist should strive to be worthy of your trust. As should your husband. Both of them need to have serious separate discussions with you about their behavior.", "so the communication issue has been cleared up BUT\n\n>Two weeks ago, he popped into the last 15 minutes of my session. They proceeded to talk about the project. During my session.\n\nthis seems highly unprofessional. you're paying your therapist to work with *you*, not to discuss her work with a third party during your sessions. you should definitely address it with her.", "Definitely NTA, but that's absolutely majorly unprofessional. Your therapist can't be friends with your husband and working with him on the side. That's. MAJOR conflict of interest.", "This feels disingenuous. You said that he told you he forgot to put the event on the calendar. 12 hrs no communication. This was before therapy. Then you said that you found out where he was from your therapist days later. Which one is it? I mean did you just not talk to him for several days but then\u2026 This is just strange.\n\nEdit to add, I just saw another comment that you said he didn\u2019t tell you because he thought you knew. So you just didn\u2019t ask? For days? Something ain\u2019t right here.", "Your therapist is hired help, and this is a business dispute about how she conducts her business: therapy. There's no interpersonal conduct here for us to judge.", "Info ... you had no idea where your husband was for 2 days?", "NAH. I don\u2019t understand why you are upset with your therapist instead of your husband. Why didn\u2019t he tell you where he was for two days?", "Soft YTA, but only because you're asking specifically about thinking your therapist crossed a boundary. Thoughts are valid, but you're aiming them in the wrong direction.\n\nYour therapist has done nothing wrong. Change \"XX Event\" to something like \"random music festival\" and she's still giving you information to try and give you piece of mind.\nHis unexplained absence was clearly affecting you, to the point it's being directly talked about in your therapy session. She's trying to provide an answer or show you that negative thoughts are misplaced.\n\nYour husband is NTA either because people forget things. If, in the two days between his absence and your session you had directly asked him where he was and he refused to tell you then that would be YTA behaviour on his part. But you've indicated that you said something along the lines of \"I didn't know where you were\" and he's replied \"I forgot to put it on the calendar\" then it's a communication breakdown.", "NTA you being uncomfortable with your partner and therapist working together on projects is understandable.\n\nWorrying about wether your husband will ask in-depth questions and client confidentiality between your therapist and him. \n\nAlso why is your husband calling it a \u201cslip up,\u201d when he should have just told you and such. Also if your wondering if they crossed a boundary then it\u2019s time to change therapists sadly.\n\nEven if y\u2019all get through it, the trust has been lost and both of them have broken their word of not interacting with each other.", "Mild ESH, but I would also change therapists. There is no reason for her to waste your session time talking to your husband, who isn\u2019t her patient, about an event that you are not involved in. She should not feel comfortable wasting her patient\u2019s appointment time on topics that do not pertain to her patient.", "YTA, this is your husband's fault. Also you're definitely making it weird when it doesn't have to be.", "YTA. I'm not understanding how the therapist is at fault for just stating the fact that she saw your husband at an event? Your husband is the one that ghosted you.\n\nSo unless I'm missing something here....", "YTA for essentially blaming your therapist for a slip up on the part of your husband.  I don\u2019t see anything wrong with her saying she saw your husband.  If it wasn\u2019t this work event but something else, say at the grocery store, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  It\u2019s your husband who didn\u2019t let you know what was going on.  Your anger should be directed at him, though not much as it was a simple slip up and not really worth dwelling on.", "YTA. Why are you making this your therapist\u2019s fault? Your husband is the one who didn\u2019t tell you about this event and didn\u2019t communicate with you.", "Why are you blaming your therapist for just saying she saw your husband somewhere? How is that a boundary violation? Your husband is the one at fault; this seems like displaced anger.\n\nNow as to your husband and therapist hijacking your therapy session (that you are paying for) to discuss business, I would definitely be upset about that. You should ask husband and therapist to cover the cost of the portion of the section that they stole from you.\n\nESH", "YTA\n\nWhy are you blaming her for your husband actions? That makes zero sense.", "If my partner was a waiter and my therapist saw her everyday, is it anyone's fault?\n\nPeople exist outside of your therapy. And in cases like therapy, certain conversations and information are not shared outside therapy.\n\nIf you feel your husband and therapist can't properly focus on you in your sessions, do not have your husband there. If you think they are behaving inappropriately or discussing you when they meet, that's a whole other level of inappropriateness. Like, legal scrutiny level of unprofessional conduct.\n\nIf you just don't like that they sometimes encounter each other when you're not around, that sounds like something your therapist should know about. Because that's an unusual concern.\n\nYTA", "NTA. You have feelings about it, and it\u2019s a great idea to discuss this directly with your therapist and process it. Any good therapist will be open to listening to you, your concerns, and ideally work with you to find a solution or refer you out if you feel the relationship rupture cannot be repaired. \n\nI\u2019m a bit unsure why your husband didn\u2019t clarify where he was Sunday, and why you found out from your therapist days later. Did he refuse to answer where he was Sunday? \n\nEither way, you are entitled to your feelings. There is a reason ideally therapists keep very clear boundaries with clients and especially people in their clients lives. It isn\u2019t ideal that they are working together on projects, and I professionally likely wouldn\u2019t have made that choice as it\u2019s a conflict of interest (which in this instance has indeed damaged your therapeutic relationship).", "YTA.   She saw him in a public place..this is on your husband for not marking it on the calendar.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI can understand the hurt, but I don\u2019t necessarily think the punishment fit the \u201ccrime\u201d.\n\nTo a certain extent your husband is guilty of not keeping you up to date on things, especially when you\u2019d established a potential (reasonableness aside) boundary regarding those things. That being said, in most jobs if there is a conflict of interest on a project, then people are required to disclose it. They both disclosed the dilemma originally to you. If they also disclosed it to the other people involved in the project, and they (the others) had no concerns over the legality and/or morality of it, then I\u2019d assume it was fine.\n \nHowever, all the therapist did was assuage your own fears about your husband. She didn\u2019t even say she spoke to him, she just said that she saw him at this event that they technically already told you the potential about, though you didn\u2019t know it was still on, due to not knowing they were going ahead with working on the same project. Would you rather she have not told you and then left you to not know what your husband was doing for all those hours and then come to the conclusion he was having an affair or something, especially since she knew the truth? And, if she hadn\u2019t told you, and you found out down the line that she knew, would you be even more upset?\n\nIf your answer to the first question is no, and the second is yes, then in no way would your therapist be a jerk for telling you that.", "Soft YTA. As an outsider, looking in, it all reads a little self-sabotage-y, as if you\u2019re looking for conflict where there isn\u2019t any.", "YTA. Maybe it's because I live in a smaller city, but I can't imagine someone dictating that a therapist can't work at certain jobs because they might have to interact with the spouse of a patient at some point. \n\nCrossing a boundary would be if she had a relationship with you or your husband, not working in the same building as a person you're close to.", "YTA, your husband is the one to blame here, nit your therapist.", "YTA. This is on your husband. Not your therapist.", "YTA\nYou say yourself that they were completely professional. So what\u2019s the issue? And why are you blaming your therapist instead of your husband? It\u2019s not her fault he didn\u2019t tell you.", "She didn't cross a boundary, but it's all sorts of weird to have your partner popping into your therapy sessions to talk shop, and him working on a professional level with the therapist. I don't know what country you're in, but in the UK all the therapists I know would see this as a conflict of interest. YTA.", "NTA but you are overreacting. I\u2019m not picking up on any sketchy behaviour. However, it would be completely appropriate to ask to be referred to a different therapist in her practice or network while they are both working together and go back when it\u2019s done if you\u2019re comfortable.", "ESH. \n\nThis is an issue between you and your husband. \n\n I do think them working together or along side one another should never have started. Its unprofessional on her end to continue once you have expressed discomfort. If there was no way to avoid the project then you should have asked her to recommend a new therapist who will not be working with your husband as it sets up the potential for things like this. A therapist is someone you have to trust, you have to be able to be open, raw, and transparent with them, that is not easy to do with someone you have experienced negative emotions with or distrusted at some point. \n\nAlso I am going to get down voted to hell but being on the spectrum is not an excuse for your husband to shut you out for days at a time and that is coming from an autistic with generalized anxiety disorder, and CPTSD (from abuse). Unless you are leaving a lot out of the story I do not see how it was accepted that for DAYS while you were upset your husband couldn't have said/texted/emailed 'I was at a work event\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like the comment was meant to help you feel less worried/upset by giving context on where he was. You need to decide if you want a therapist who can give this context or not.", "INFO I'm confused about the 12 hours your husband was \"incommunicado\".  Why didn't you just ask him?  You say you found out where he was days later when you had you session and mentioned it to your therapist.    I agree it was kind of an AH move for your husband to \"pop in\" to your session and talking about work--you should have called him on that when it happened.\n\nWhy, specifically, do you now think you can't trust her?", "I say not the ah. I think your husband and therapist should have limited interaction outside of therapy because she does have him sit in on visits. Like if they see each other in passing that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t know if a therapist can stay neutral if they are having a friendship/work relationship with someone and seeing their spouse that seems like a conflict of interest. I do think her comment was to help not harm but perhaps she didn\u2019t say it in the best manner. \nYour husband does need to do better on this part. Your visits are to remain about personal topics. He does need to learn to try not to shut down when your upset. I think you can trust them both this was a series of disasters that\u2019s all.", "That\u2019s definitely a real issue here.", "Yes, unless the building is on fire there's no reason to interrupt. Would he have felt as free to pop in and take up the last 15 minutes of someone else's appointment? I think not.\n\nProbably tapping the brakes on continued sessions with this therapist, until her work project with Hubby is over, is the best thing to do since the therapist just can't keep her professional interactions with Hubby out of it and Hubby is determined to keep encroaching.\n\nAgree that OP is NTA.", "Yes, this was my take. In itself its not a problem that the therapist knew where her husband was, but given that OP expressed discomfort with her therapist working with her husband (which is reasonable) and the therapist assured her they wouldn't be working together, the fact that's it's now come up twice in sessions is going to be unsettling for OP. \n\nAnd I get that the therapist may have good reasons for doing the event, despite the conflict of interest, but in that case, it's her responsibility to manage that, and perhaps help OP find a more neutral therapist, but it sounds like she instead misled OP about the extent of their involvement, (either deliberately or unintentionally) and now is doing a bad job of keeping it out of sessions. I'd be very uncomfortable with the situation as well.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "Her feeling comfortable taking to a non-patient about non-patient related topics during a patient\u2019s appointment (which the patient pays for) is a problem, and not a minor one. It also isn\u2019t a minor issue, this is actually a major issue and OP should be talking to her therapist\u2019s higher ups (if it isn\u2019t solely the therapist\u2019s practice) about providers taking  1/3-1/4 (depending on if OP\u2019s place does 45 or 60 minute appointments) of the appointment time to discuss business with a non-patient.", "Yes, definitely going to address this.

This is not the same though.", "The way I was raised broke me, and I had some hereditary mental illness too. My mind tells me lies sometimes, so I have to ask.", "That\u2019s an entirely different scenario than her seeing him at a work event for a partnership you are aware they are both part of. If your husband failed to tell you where he was days after disappearing for 12 hours to have entirely different issues. Did you seriously not know for days between that Sunday and your next therapy session?", "Oh I can understand that. I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. My brain loves to invent things that never actually happened but I remember them perfectly. You\u2019ll be alright. You\u2019re already doing well because you\u2019re recognizing that sometimes you need an outside perspective. You\u2019ve got this. Talk to your boyfriend (hubby oops). Even going with my worst assumption, it didn\u2019t sound like malice on his part. You guys get that communication thing down and you guys get stronger."]}
