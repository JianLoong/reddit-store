Uncrowded local breweries, hikes, cabins that's my jam. I understand my view point is different from theirs, so for everyone to be happy it's better to just vacation separately. \n\nSo you don't miss out on family time, maybe you guys could compromise on doing big vacations separately but find a more local vacation spot for a weekend getaway here and there?", "It\u2019s your hard-earned vacation days and vacation budget.
