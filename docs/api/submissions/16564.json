It's been a difficult pregnancy. My ankles, fingers and legs have swollen to a point of needing medications and it's hard to walk most days.

Despite me losing weight (16lbs) in the first trimester, the water weight gain took a massive toll in the beginning of my second trimester. \n\nWell..

She's now on meds for a bit but she's perfectly fine, honestly. Despite this, my fianc\u00e9 is losing his absolute shit and has decided that \"given how traumatic this is for **everyone involved**\" he needs to cut back his hours at work significantly until his dog is better because he needs to be with her 24/7 because he doesn't trust anyone else to watch her (as in he went from 5 days a week to 2 days). I told him I could do it. I'm home anyways. He responds to this by saying \"Yeah but you're pregnant and have a hard enough time anyways so that's not an option right now\". Then later that night he suggested I go get a job to make up for the hours he is missing from being home with his dog. So basically, I'm pregnant and have too much on my plate to watch his fucking dog but apparently I'm well enough to go work a full time job on my feet all day. \n\nI told him this wasn't an option. I can barely stand long enough to cook dinner and there's no way I'm going to go work full time so he can stay home with his dog. I also said that him acting like it's the end of the fucking world because his dog is on antibiotics is really off putting, especially where he's putting our livelihood at risk when the dog is literally fine (even the vet said she's fine). He told me that I \"wouldn't understand his position\" because he's the dog person, not me, and that right now I should want to make sacrifices to help his mental state. At this point I told him I couldn't fucking depend on him for anything and I ended up going and staying with his mother- leaving him at home crying on the floor with his dog (who was literally smothering his face and acting completely normal). He has called and begged me to come home because I \"should be supporting him right now\" but I'm honestly really repulsed by this.

She was on some meds for a bit, and she even tried to steal treats off of the vets counter after they made her regurgitate food, so she was feeling fine then.
