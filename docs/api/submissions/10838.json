This months have been really hard for me and especially when i am at school and i try to focus. Today i recieved a follow request on Instagram from a user called \"deadfather_(my name)\". I immediately show it to my mother and we filled a report to the police who will find the person who did it. I am 100% sure that it is a classmate of mine since the other people who know about my dad's passing are 50 years old friends of my parents who can't even use social media. My mother told me that when the police  finds the person who did it, she is just going to \"scare them off\" using the cops or someone else and then drop the charges so they will  understand that they are powerless and wont try to do something similar again. I disagree. Throughout my childhood i have been bullied so many times and have changed 4 school because of it. Its about time someone pays for what they have done and i will not feel guilty if they have to pay a fine or go on a juvenile detention center. My mother was shocked and told me it is not fair because they are underage and immature. Am I the a-hole for standing by my opinion even though it's harsh ?\n\n\nEDIT: The report we filled was not only about my harassment but about harassing a decreased person. Also I am not in the US and the police officers told us that if we take this on court the person who did it will face great consequences.

Possibly expulsion if this was done by someone with a history of bullying.\n\nIt's also possible that they don't find out who did this - my guess is that it's pretty low on the police priority list. \n\nI'm really sorry that you have to go through this type of bullying, especially at the same time as you're mourning your father.", "From my rudimentary understanding of the law, there is no such thing as \u201cpressing charges\u201d if it is a criminal case. \n\nCriminal suits are brought by the state not the individual. For example (extreme example to illustrate the point): if someone is murdered, and the police know about it, it doesn\u2019t really matter if the family of the victim says \u201clet\u2019s drop the charges\u201d. The family can make it hard by not cooperating, but technically the crime was a crime against the state and therefore it is the government that must pursue the criminal.\n\nI explain this in part to give you comfort about your decision. Your job is to inform the police, you did that. How far punishment goes is not your problem, it is the state\u2019s. If the state has prescribed a given punishment for this act, then the culprit should and will receive that punishment (it will not be jail).\n\nIn short, you are not the jury. This is not your decision, leave it to the system and don\u2019t feel bad about it. \n\nNTA and sorry that all this happened to you. In my experience, seeing an act like this get punished is very cathartic. It reinforces to yourself that you cannot be treated badly and that you can stand up for yourself.", "This really depends on your country. In many counties this is not illegal or at least not illegal enough for cops to bother. You might be able to take it up with school admin.", "NTA but I don't know what charges you'd be able to press.

And if they want to do it, they should deal with the consequences.", "NTA for wanting the person to face consequences but sadly I dont think anything beyond a scare would come of this unless you can prove this specific person has been harrasing you. So you should ready yourself for the police to dont do much beyond a \"stern talking to\". That being said if the person is a classmate of yours and you can prove its them you could report them to the school/college. Were they could also face more likely consequences like a suspension", "NTA. Depending on jurisdiction, cyerbullying may actually be a crime.\n\nDon't delude yourself into thinking this will have condequences for the instigator, though. Actually finding the person behind some fake account usually takes resources/skills local law enforcement doesn't have, and higher tiers of law enforcement probably won't \"waste\" on something that isn't even a death threat, let alone against someone that matters.", "Nta actions have consequences", "NTA, I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I'm American so I'm unsure how your laws work, but after reading some of the comments, it seems that no jail time would actually occur. That alone would take away any guilt I would have and would press it as far as I could. The reason is for all the bullying you have mentioned. Even if it's only a little punishment, ie a fine or suspension, I would still push it if only to validate all of the years you've had to put up with the bullies. Even if it's a small win, it's a win.\n\nRegardless of being a minor, they should know that what they're doing is wrong. Since they're doing it anyway, seems to me they need a hard life lesson about actions having consequences. Maybe when they lose someone they love, they'll open their eyes to how awful they have been.\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your father. Losing someone you love is extremely difficult and I wish you all the best.", "NTA\n\nbut I don't think that person will go to jail. \n\nAlso, just some unsolicited advice: you might have been bullied a lot when you were younger, but don't take it all out on this person.

They didn\u2019t threaten you, they didn\u2019t slander you. Sounds like they haven\u2019t tried sending friend requests multiple times or rapidly from similarly named accounts (IE harassment).

I\u2019m no lawyer but it doesn\u2019t sound like it. \n\nYou are NTA for wanting a bully to be held accountable (and not just \u201cscared straight\u201d as your mother wants), but don\u2019t get your hopes up anything comes of your police report. You are getting REALLLLYYY close to being the AH who wants vengeance not justice. Let me give you some advice as a kid that was bullied his fair share growing up, don\u2019t go down this path of anger. It\u2019s sincerely is not worth it. Do great in school, go to a better college, build a successful career and life and family of your own. Your bully will peak in HS, never leave their home town, and still be trying to pull others down to their level. 20 years from now you\u2019ll both look each other up on whatever social media looks like then and you\u2019ll have that warm satisfaction you won life. And your bully is gonna have to see it. Let go of the anger, don\u2019t let them suck you down to their level. Good luck!", "I doubt the police will be able to figure out who set it up, they wouldn't put a lot of money or effort into that. More than likely it'll be on file so if more were to happen, they can build a case of harassment. However, at this level, it won't lead to jail time. So, it's kind of irrelevant whether or not you would or wouldn't care if someone was punished  on this.", "NTA I'm glad you pressed charges. If nothing else you took control of the situation.", "first, i\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your father. it\u2019s tough at any age. mine was 92 and still it feels too soon. \n\nyou don\u2019t give your age so it\u2019s hard to know how old these Instagram AHs are.  but regardless of age it\u2019s a cold, unfeeling way to treat anybody - which is also the problem with bullies.  i think if someone has a total lack of empathy - they are never too young to be taught a lesson.  you can never be too young to be taught to walk in other people\u2019s shoes, to know how their brainless actions hurt others. \n\nmostly bullies grow out of this cruel behavior but that will be too late to heal your pain.  i think they need a lesson but not harsh punishment, because they are young (again I don\u2019t know how old you are, but if they\u2019re 13 and under, then, that\u2019s pretty young. Anything older than that, and they should be starting to know better. but bullying doesn\u2019t really stop until college)\n\nin the meantime, I know it\u2019s hard, but try to ignore the bullies and certainly don\u2019t let any of what they say get into your brain. It\u2019s going to bang around the inside of your head, but don\u2019t absorb it, because it means nothing. whatever they say to you it\u2019s not the truth. who you are right now it\u2019s not the person you will always be.  you will gain strength and confidence, knowledge and skill sets. At some point in your life, you will be confident in who you are, and these people won\u2019t matter. keep in mind that it\u2019s usually the kids that are bullied that turn out to have the most success in life.\n\nThat is my hope for you. Oh yeah and NTA.", "This incident isn't anything to press charges over.\n\nIt's in poor taste, yes, but I don't think it's an actual crime.\n\nESH", "This is cyber bullying. Consequences should \n follow. NTA", "I'm sorry for your loss, but I'd lower your expectations about how things will play out.", "Where do you live that this is a crime.

Internet impersonation/harassment cases are unlikely to result in anything more than a warning, even if you win.  There's also a good chance you would not win because you wouldn't be able to prove certain elements of the claim with the requisite certainty.

I am old enough that social media doesn\u2019t seem that important to me, but apparently there is plenty of evidence of cyberbullying causing teenagers mental health problems (up to and including suicide), worsened academic outcomes, and so on, so my state takes it very seriously.\n\nAs someone who grew up and went to school before anyone cared about bullying, I think it\u2019s a good thing for schools to take this stuff seriously. No kid should be told to just suck it up if they are subjected to consistent harassment by someone in their school community.\n\nDespite our state statute, we had a 14-year-old take her own life just a few weeks ago.

A day afterwards she told her father that she didn\u2019t want to be known as the girl who this happened to and killed herself later that night. Now hundreds of people are showing up at school board meetings talking about how the bullying situation has been allowed to get totally out-of-control at that particular school.\n\nEven though that incident involved a physical assault, it is very likely that non-physical things that were merely \u201cmean\u201d were done to this girl by these same perpetrators in the months leading up to this assault.
