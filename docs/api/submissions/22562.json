I (30m) haven't seen them in 2 years but still on good terms with them. I am currently not in the US, flying to the US (NY) from EU tomorrow for two weeks because I am sitting for the bar exam in NY. For those who does not know, the bar exam is two days exam in July on July 26 and July 27 and I am a bit worried/nervous about the exam.\n\nDanny sent the invitations almost a year ago, and I told him (before the deadline to RSVP) that I won't be attending the wedding because it will be the weekend just before the exam and I am a kind of person who just can't do/celebrate/have fun before a big exam like this one. I would feel super guilty. \n\nDanny and Sarah said it is fine and \"there will always be a seat for \\[you\\] at our wedding\". I told them I highly doubt I will be able to make it (jet lag, time difference, exam anxiety, etc.) and I know myself I am always be behind my studying schedule. I bought them the gifts (customised watches for couples and a gift from their wish-list).  They don't know about the watches yet but they know about the gift from the wish-list website.\n\nOver the weekend I was Facetime-ing them and they asked about my studies in which I (regrettably) said, for the first time I am ahead of my studying schedule but still need to improve my score and I am just worried about that. They said I should come to the wedding as I am ahead of my schedule and it would be a good break for me. I reminded them that the wedding is 4 days before the exam and no way I will make it. It went back and forth for a few minutes before they reminded that they always kept a seat for me and thought I will make it anyways because of my close relationship with them and I should just fly to SF instead of NY and then to NY after the wedding. After arguing for a while, I just told them, I am gonna hang up the phone because I really can't deal with drama or anything now. The phone ended with Danny calling me AH for this.\n\nOur group of friends reached out separately trying to convince to change my mind and it will be a good time for a reunion and drink with friends (I haven't drank for 2 months since I started studying) and some of them said I am the AH because they kept a seat for me and it wasn't cheap. \n\nI now feel really guilty for not being there for his wedding but at the same time, in my book, it just does not make any sense, fly to SF (which I'm sure I won't be able to study while I am there) and then to NY. I will be super tired by the day of the exam. I feel like I am not wrong here, but the more they talk the more I feel like I am AH for not insisting from the beginning to not keep me a seat even if I said I doubt I will be able to make it. I am considering offering to pay for the seat but I still believe I will not go (well unless the exam is canceled).\n\nAITA for standing firm and WIBTAH if I don't go?", "created_utc": 1689669999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152sudy/aita_for_not_attending_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 33, "replies": ["NTA. \n\nYou were pretty clear from the jump as to the fact that you can't attend and why. You've gone above and beyond with buying them presents and while its a lovely gesture that they're keeping a seat for you, it's their choice to do so and shouldn't be guilting you for it.", "NTA. While I don't know the American bar exam, I know the German equivalent to it, and this exam is too important and too time and mind consuming to celebrate anything in the time before. It will disrupt your sleep pattern that is important to have working during these days, it might kill not only the day of the wedding, but the potential hangover, sleep depravation and / or extra travel time will kill at least two to three days you could use for something else. If you are ahead of your schedule, the right thing to do is to go to a spa to relax and prepare this way, not to make something that will drain your energy you need.\n\nEveryone trying to pressure you is a massive asshole, disregarding your essential needs, especially after you were completely open about the issue from the very moment you first heard of it.", "NTA you told them you couldn\u2019t attend. They chose not to listen and they should respect how hard and important this is.", "NTA, but it's ultimately their choice to keep the seat or not. They just can't get angry at you if you don't go because you warned them.", "NTA. Don't go. If you go and do poorly on the bar exam, you are gonna regret not studying more. All your years of studying in law school were to pass the bar exam. It was so much time and money.\n\nI remember being pressured by friends and an ex to go out when I had to study for midterm exams, then I was really stressed. It's not their fault. It was my fault for having difficulty saying no.\n\nYou already prepared some nice presents to give them. They can invite someone else last minute to take your seat. And you told them from the beginning that you aren't able to make it.", "The wedding is 4 days before the exam?\nWedding  is in SF and exam is in NY...\n\nNTA.   Even if you're  ahead, you still read and re read over notes.\n\nAnd don't pay for the seat. It's  their choice to hold it. \n\nGood luck on the exam.", "NTA\n\nI once ignored my instinct to avoid a social engagement the day before an important job interview and ended up losing focus and tanked the interview. So I get where you are coming from. You let them know that you would not attend before their RSVP date. You did the right thing.\n\nI understand them hoping that you would change your mind. But if they were keeping the seat for you then they should have kept it knowing that there was a risk that you wouldn't attend in the end and they should have been willing to bear that cost. But if that's the primary sticking point and you can afford to pay them, that may grease the wheels of your friendship.\n\nDon't let this distract you. Switch off your phone if you need to so that you can concentrate on your studies and ignore the calls from anyone who isn't honoring your choices. Stick to your plan. Then once the exams are over reach out to your friends and make a plan to catch up. Hopefully the friendship is robust enough to allow you to get past the disappointment of you not attending the wedding. \n\nAnd best wishes for the exam.", "NTA at all. They can\u2019t get mad at you for saving a seat for you after you told them that you\u2019re not going to go.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou told them you would not come, do not give in to their manipulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny cost they have is their own fault.", "NTA and YWNBTA - what kind of friends wish you to jeopardize your career for the sake of a glorified party?  \n\nVery shallow and selfish ones.", "NTA, you told them that date wouldn't work and why. They ignored you, whether in good intentions or not, so they can't hold you responsible for spending the money.", "NTA\n\nYou told them ages before that you couldn't make it. That's how an RSVP works.\n\nIs it  the reception \"held seat\" that worries you? \n\nWhat \"Held\" - they pull a seat over if you show up.\n\nThe only extra expense would be the dinner and people will gladly dispose of that.\n\nAnd you got them special gifts.\n\nSo there is no problem, here.\n\nIf you have 2 week vacation, you might be able to see the couple after they return from their honeymoon.\n\nYour priority is the exam.\nIf you know yourself, and that you will need the post-travel recovery and the test prep time,\nthen there shouldn't be a conflict in your mind.\n\nYour friends will understand\nthe importance of  the test for your career and livelihood.\n  \nSure, they will miss you. But they will be so busy at the wedding reception\n\nYou could send a tape of a toast to the couple and/or a \"roast\" of your friend, Dan,\nthe groom.", "Seems to me like your friends have raken for granted that when you say no, it always end up as a yes!\nI'd say they're no friends of you for 2 reasons:\n- first they can't accept when you say no and stick to it\n- they really don't give a f**k that in going you may jeopardiaze your future! (And that it would mean throw away all the tile you've spent en working)\nNta and be strong to your friends", "Nta.\n\nIf you rsvp'd no, told them no. It is no longer your issue.", "NTA. When the bar exam exists, nothing else does. I've taken and passed four states in my career. It's a living nightmare and completely consumes you. The risk of failure is too high. Anyone who would distract you from studying the weekend before is not your friend.", "you rsvp\u2019d. you rsvp\u2019d no. their decision to flush money down the toilet is odd, certainly, but hardly your responsibility. nta. next time maybe ask how many times they need to hear no before they believe it. so far it\u2019s looking like \u201cmore than four.\u201d", "NTA. You told them a year ago you can't make its, its not your fault they still paid for extras.", "The exam is so important. I couldn't enjoy the wedding myself if I were dealing with that stress.\n\nNever mind the jet lag impact.", "NTA. If you fly from the EU to SF and then back to NY, you\u2019ll be very jet lagged when you take the exam. \n\nOne question though \u2026 how often is the bar exam given? if you knew about the wedding a year ago, could you have picked a different date to take the test?", "UPDATE: \n\nThank you everyone for your comments and your support!! I will stand firm at my position and not attend the wedding. I believe they are going through stressful time during the wedding maybe so I will give them that and I think after the exam/wedding things will cool off probably but even if not, that's fine. As many of you highlighted, the exam is a priority, that's my career so...!\n\nWish you all a great day/evening!!", "NAH, in my opinion - well apart from the others in your friend group. You told them you couldn't make it in good time so there's nothing wrong from your side. However, he's your best friend I can see why yes really trying to convince you. I also don't think they've actively paid extra for you (I could be wrong). How I see it is then saying if you do decide to come they'll make space for you. Good luck with the bar!", "Nta.  You told him that you wouldn't go right from the beginning.  \n\nYou should go.  You have the time. You will be in the States. You studied already.  He is your best friend.   Go have fun.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You need to focus on the bar exam. While you shouldn't study the last few days, you also shouldn't do things that stress you out", "NTA, you already said no and they didn't hear your no. If they want to keep a seat for you that's fine but they should never make you feel bad about it. It doesn't sound like you are in the bridal party, just a regular guest. As long as you give them a wedding present I think that makes up for any cost of the seat. Maybe you can also send them a nice video message the morning of the wedding to say how much their friendship means and give them all the nice well wishes that you would have given them in person.", "The bar exam is twice a year, you can write it in Feb or in Jul. I didn't pass the July one last year and couldn't take/study/prepare for the Feb one of 2023 because of work. I knew once I received the result year I would not have the time for Feb 2023 that's why I knew I would not be able to attend the wedding."]}
