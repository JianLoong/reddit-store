Even before I was engaged or planning a wedding I knew I did not want children under the age of 10 at my wedding unless my partner had kids that needed to be included (they did not). To give a bit of background my parents are the younger siblings of 6 children each so my family is quite big and my cousins are all older than me. When planning my wedding I was told by the catering company I hired that even if they are less than a year old if they eat a bit of food we will charge the $65 per plate\u2026 weddings are expensive. This requirement though was going to help me back my claim to not let any kids younger than 10 to come, or so I thought. \n\nWe sent out the save the dates all my cousins called telling me they were excited everything seemed ok because all of them seemed fine with the children rule. This lasted until the invitations were sent out. To avoid anyone being confused on who were allowed to rsvp my mom and I prefilled out the numbers of guest attending for each party. As those who know you need to have your final numbers in for everything at least a month in advance so we required all rsvps be sent back a month before the wedding. The time came to tally up numbers and my cousin (34M) and his wife (32F) have yet to to respond so I reach out. Nothing. Wait a week and reach out again. Nothing. Now to put some background on us I talked to this pair almost weekly, they were the siblings I never had. This ghosting was weird. So I go over to their place to see if they could talk in person.\n\nI get there and see both cars are home I knock on the door to avoid waking the baby. My cousins wife swings open the door already with an angry look. I ask to come in. No. I ask if we can talk. No. Finally my cousin appears and his wife runs off crying. I ask why they hadn\u2019t rsvpd back and what\u2019s going on. He tells me I\u2019m a jerk and asshole for not allowing them to bring their kid and they hope my wedding goes terrible. He then closes the door leaving me shocked. To give more background the birth and conception of the kid was rough so this baby is a miracle. I love this kid, just don\u2019t want it at my wedding.\n\nThe day before the wedding my aunt calls demanding why I won\u2019t invite my cousins and why her DIL won\u2019t come out of the house. This causes half of my moms family to not show. The wedding still happened and as said awesome. My moms side of the family still refuses to talk to us and are requesting I apologize to my cousin and his wife for not inviting them and their baby to my wedding.\n\nI really love them and never meant to make them feel this way but this was how I wanted my wedding. So AITA if I stand my ground and not apologize?", "created_utc": 1689199467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14y275g/aita_for_not_letting_my_cousin_bring_their/", "score": 251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t understand why people get so butthurt over this.", "I would say a majority of parents wouldn't be comfortable leaving a *newborn* with a babysitter", "You didn\u2019t breastfeed I guess if you got a sitter for a newborn", "It sounds like the cousin may be having some postpartum issues and needs some help. Breaking down sobbing and refusing to come out of the house for two days is not at all a normal reaction to being told you can't bring your newborn to someone else's wedding. It really isn't safe to be taking a newborn to that big of an event anyway.", "Agreed", "NTA I attended a wedding 6 months postpartum and had to use a breast pump in my car during the cocktail hour. \n\nI would have never dreamed to ask to bring my baby nor get upset that they didn\u2019t want kids there.", "> So I go over to their place to see if they could talk in person.\n\nCousin didn't show up with babe in arms. OP went to the cousin's house uninvited and stirred things up.", "And to top all of that saying they hope OP's wedding is ruined will never make me talk to them, let alone apologize or see them in person unless unavoidable.\n\nAlso cousin made half of mom's family not attend the event by turning them against OP, Lord knows how many details they changed to fit their narrative. \n\nNTA", "They didn\u2019t have a wedding unfortunately because of COVID so I don\u2019t know if they would have kids or not there. They\u2019re like the only decent catering place where I\u2019m from and know that so they charge by plate sadly\u2026 they know how to play the game", "I really hope so too because I seriously had such a tight relationship with them and now it\u2019s like I mean nothing. I\u2019m not sure to reach out to them  and try and talk and see both sides but I know I have to tred lightly if I end up doing it. I just wanted to be sure I was Kent missing something", "What did cousin/husband do that was dramatic. An unannounced OP appeared at their door, they wouldn't let the OP in and asked them to leave. That's all that cousin did. No drama.", "The baby was 9 months old", "Yeah that was on me for going over unannounced I just really missed them. Now I\u2019m trying to figure out how to rectify this all maybe?", "If you have someone so close to you that you speak weekly and they just ghost on you, I would hope you would go check on them to make sure everything is ok. But maybe you\u2019re the type that just writes off people at the slightest misstep", "This was a weird reaction from him but I shouldn\u2019t have gone over unannounced I guess.", "I was a bridesmaid in my best friend\u2019s wedding. Her cousin brought her 9mo old and the baby cried during half the ceremony. The mom for some reason refused to take the baby out of the room and instead stood up during the ceremony and was loudly \u201cshush\u201d-ing her for several minutes before she got enough dirty looks that she finally WENT OUTSIDE. It was annoying.", "Yes", "Is that seriously what you got out of that? No where did it say that. She said she went there to find out about the RSVP and the lack of communication; she didn't know why they hadn't responded.\n\nWork on your reading comprehension a little.", "Well their kid is being raised by 2 entitled overdramatic jerks, so he'll probably turn the same.", "Kid is 9 months, not a newborn.", "No, it's not.", "Umm they owe OP an apology\u2026 not the other way around", "Thank you for the insight this is why I came here to ask I needed someone else\u2019s perspective! I called the baby an it because I wanted to post anonymously and try as much not to let this get back to my family that I was asking strangers their opinion on family matters so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t name the gender to try to make the story pretty vague! The baby is a healthy baby boy though for those who are curious! Again though I needed to seriously read this to understand how to proceed and such so thank you seriously!", "Jesus, you're just looking for reasons to be offended. \"tHe bAbY iS nOt aN 'iT'\" good fucking gravy.", "They are absolutely NOT the exception to the rule whatsoever. What are you even talking about?", "Yes on the RSVP and the wedding website it had a frequently asked questions and it asked are kids allowed and it said while we love your kids we would love for you to leave them at home if they are 10 and under so you may enjoy this time with us! And I really honestly didn\u2019t think of the postpartum and that makes me feel really bad now!", "I get the feeling mom's family got told a different story than what really happened. OP did invite them, just not the baby, so we already know they got that bit wrong.\n\nOP is NTA", "I\u2019m a parent and I don\u2019t get bent out of shape. I don\u2019t bring my kids to weddings even if kids are welcome because despite all our best efforts, they are feral about 50% of the time. \n\nFrom friends/people I know with different perspectives: Lack of trustworthy babysitters and/or the money to pay for them is one reason. \u201cWe had kids at our wedding so how dare you choose differently\u201d or \u201cwe should be the exception because faaaaaamily\u201d are others.", "I wonder too. Yeah it\u2019s one thing to not be able to attend and simply declining the invite versus throwing a fit over it.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s that some parents see their child as an extension of themselves instead of the child being a person in their own right. So their child not being invited is perceived as some sort of personal slight and a rejection of the parent in part.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the idea that some people buy into that having a child is the most important thing a person can do \u2014 that nothing anyone can do that can compare, that there\u2019s a status that comes with that. So how dare someone not acknowledge that.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s that for many parents, the child is the center of their world and some find it hard when someone else doesn\u2019t assign that same level of importance to that child. How dare they not see how special they are!\n\nIt all gets amplified if they think their baby is a \u201cmiracle.\u201d\n\nJust some thoughts. Maybe it\u2019s something else entirely.", "If the baby was a newborn and exclusively breastfed, the mom needs to nurse every 2 hours. She needs to bring the baby so it can eat. Especially if the baby doesn't take a bottle.\n\nIf the kids are older, we always struggle that we have is that for family weddings, all of our babysitters are at the wedding. It's hard to get someone to watch the kids. Especially if it's an out of town wedding. We do and do without complaint, but it's so much easier if the kids are invited", "Not a parent, but have seen plenty of posts on here about parents of 'miracle' babies expecting special treatment for their little darling or whatever. And then they get pissy that OP won't make a special exception to their child-free wedding rules because it shows she obviously hates them and the baby.\n\nParents like these reek of entitlement.", "I\u2019m not a parent, but have many friends and family with kids, and the notion that leaving a newborn with a babysitter is a simple solution is seriously out of touch with reality. No, many parents (especially mums) do not get time away from their kid during the 2-3 months of them being a newborn, and that\u2019s not something that is wrong or needs to be corrected, it\u2019s just a fact of life. By saying their newborn baby can\u2019t attend, they\u2019re also saying at least one of the parents - more likely the mum - can\u2019t attend. Not to mention that the complications around the birth of their kid has likely left them with trauma that I\u2019m sure has reasonably heightened the emotions around this entire situation.", "Weddings are about family.  It is being a hypocrite to only want some family to come and not all the family.", "Seriously, why the fuck would you want to bring a newborn to a huge gathering of strangers during a pandemic??", "She didn't stir anything up she went over to find out if they were coming to the wedding and if everything was ok.", "Found the cousin? \ud83e\udd14", "How old is the newborn? Maybe your cousin was feeling like you were intentionally making it so she couldn\u2019t come if she couldn\u2019t bring the newborn. If the baby was very young, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave him with a babysitter. You\u2019re NTA, but I could see in the haze of postpartum her feelings being super hurt if babes-in-arms weren\u2019t an exception and you two are really close like you say.", "That and complaining to everyone that their beloved spawn wasn't allowed to go to the wedding. And the \"won't come out of the house\" thing?? Give me a break...", "Told them they hoped the wedding went terribly? Ghosted her and turned the family against her, causing their absence on her special day? They could\u2019ve simply *communicated* but instead handled it like children.", "bro learn how to read lmao", "Okay. For future reference not a newborn. Both my kids were almost walking by that point. \n\nI think at that age it is much more clearly a NTA situation. If you had said 4 weeks or something it might be different.", "When communication breakdowns happen, I\u2019m a big fan of writing a letter. They won\u2019t be able to resist reading it, they will probably read it more than once, they can\u2019t interrupt it, or slam the door on it. And it will stay with them and make them think about their reaction and your reasonable request for a while. I would definitely throw in how much you miss them.", "What do you need to rectify? Truly, what? They should be asking themselves how they rectify it with you. \n\nTheir child isn\u2019t the Messiah. \n\nIt\u2019s ok for you and your partner to decide that you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding. If they get their feelings hurt about that, that\u2019s on them.", "You won\u2019t be able to. Forget them. Move on.", "No, but after multiple attempts at communication, I would honor their \u201cNo.\u201d  You wouldn\u2019t?", "You didn't know the landmine you were walking into when you showed up.. don't blame yourself... his reaction was complete uncalled for.", "Sounds annoying, it's not as if the baby knows what the occasion is surley can get a babysitter for a few hours, plus the parents can enjoy the day bit more aswell then", "Why didn\u2019t you correct the rest of the family who are accusing you of not inviting them?", "A lack of an RSVP by the deadline is a no. Them not responding to her texts is a no.", "The OP wrote/asked/ etc the cousin repeatedly and finally barged in at her home unannounced. OP is an ass for dropping by uninvited. OP's only message was that the kid was not welcome.", "Yes, it is. In fact the only exceptions I've ever seen IRL for childless weddings are newborns, because again, sometimes you can't leave them for long.", "OP seems to want to reconcile - they're not going to come and apologize, so my suggestion is to apologize that it hurt them. And as I said, they'll likely also apologize too and admit it was an overreaction. if they don't then they are ridiculous and it's probably not worth the time.", "Girl. Stop. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. You had a shiny backbone and you\u2019re losing it. Stop second guessing yourself. They were massive fucking assholes who threw ALL of you away because of an invite that didn\u2019t include ANY kids not just theirs. Their kid isn\u2019t special. Everyone who loves their damn kid says their kid is a miracle, because they are TO THEM, not to anyone else. The kid doesn\u2019t deserve anything different than any other kid. \n\nStop and realize you are fine. You probably didn\u2019t need to go to their house, but that\u2019s it. You were never the asshole here. Do not apologize.", "Then you are absolutely fine and NTA. I honestly love and appreciate that you were like \"HERE IS THE THIIIING\" we love a communicative human. And you are 1000000% fine with having that as a rule.\n\nDon't feel bad about the postpartum - that is out of your control - and not communicated with you... but could also be why its hitting her so hard. My sis used to get upset about the weirdest things when she was postpartum. I wish you the best and hope you have a fantastic wedding. :) Congratulations!", "I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the only parent to occasionally use the word \u201cferal\u201d when referring to my offspring.", "Yeah, I had to decline a wedding when my daughter was young because it was too far away to leave her at home (she was still nursing), and I would have been too focused on her to enjoy the event if she came.\n\nSome people also just see weddings as family events and so **all** family should be invited, no matter what age (or drama, level of relationship, etc.).", "You\u2019re not supposed to give a rational answer that shows any understanding or compassion to anyone but the bride in a wedding post on this sub. If the bride wanted to sacrifice her 3 year old niece to a volcano at her shower, the answer is that the parent who objects is entitled. \n\nBut other than that, your response is the correct one.", "She went over uninvited to people who had repeatedly avoided communicating with the OP.

I\u2019m not sure how soon or not soon it is to leave a baby of that age?

Newborn is more like first 4-6 weeks, when it truly is very hard for a nursing mom to be separated from a baby. I tend to consider newborn+mom a single unit. But 9 months? No, NTA.", "If your best friend, who you communicated with weekly, all of a sudden stopped responding to you about anything for months, you wouldn't be concerned about them at all?", "Yeah it\u2019s really dumb and inconsiderate on the parents\u2019 part. Babies don\u2019t understand the significance of a wedding and they can be really disruptive.", "I tried, but in the end they were still mad bc I didn\u2019t let them Bring their baby (which this would be the kids grandma that was upset)", "I agree, I don't like people stopping by my house unexpected.\n\nThough again, she never said she went inside; she asked and was told no. Where are you getting \"barged in\" from?", "As someone who has been in the wedding industry for almost 2 decades, no they don't. No kids means no kids. If there are exceptions, they are given by the bride and groom beforehand. They didn\u2019t even ask or anything, just ghosted.", "I usually stick with \u201cheathen\u201d and my dad proudly wears the title \u201cking of the heathens\u201d.", "It\u2019s definitely more often the second thing you said. Nothing to do with the logistics or schematics, just petty attitudes stemming from insecurity and/or righteousness.", "If I had relatives who I spoke with weekly in a sibling sort of manner, who hasn't rsvpd or communicated with me at ALL I would be worried and also go over to their house to make sure they were ok.\n\nKnocking on a door is not barging in.", "Cousin, is that you?", "She didn\u2019t barge in. You reading the same post that I am reading??", ">She barged in unannounced\n\nyou want so desperately to not be wrong that you're straight up inventing stuff. Must be a nice little imaginary world that you live in.  I bet it gets lonely making yourself mad over things that literally never happened lol.", "Lol a 9 month old is not a newborn. They could have definitely gotten a babysitter or else just not attend like normal people react to these things.", "My baby at 9 months refused bottles so I couldn't leave her with anyone. It was torture until she was weaned. I would say that is the only scenario where an exception needs to be made.", "You should really edit your post to add that the baby was 9m. \"Newborn\" implies only a few weeks/months old.", "Agree. I was looking to see if any comments said the baby\u2019s age. It is hard to leave a baby that is truly a newborn. But 9 months old should be a little easier.", "Which is their right, just like it's OPs right to have a childless wedding. And idk newborns have been at all the weddings I've been to, my wedding included."]}
