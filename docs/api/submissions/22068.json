{"id": 22068, "submission_id": "14y275g", "title": "AITA for not letting my cousin bring their newborn baby to my wedding?", "selftext": "I (26f) got married about 6 months ago, it was amazing and everything I dreamed of as a little girl! Even before I was engaged or planning a wedding I knew I did not want children under the age of 10 at my wedding unless my partner had kids that needed to be included (they did not). To give a bit of background my parents are the younger siblings of 6 children each so my family is quite big and my cousins are all older than me. When planning my wedding I was told by the catering company I hired that even if they are less than a year old if they eat a bit of food we will charge the $65 per plate\u2026 weddings are expensive. This requirement though was going to help me back my claim to not let any kids younger than 10 to come, or so I thought. \n\nWe sent out the save the dates all my cousins called telling me they were excited everything seemed ok because all of them seemed fine with the children rule. This lasted until the invitations were sent out. To avoid anyone being confused on who were allowed to rsvp my mom and I prefilled out the numbers of guest attending for each party. As those who know you need to have your final numbers in for everything at least a month in advance so we required all rsvps be sent back a month before the wedding. The time came to tally up numbers and my cousin (34M) and his wife (32F) have yet to to respond so I reach out. Nothing. Wait a week and reach out again. Nothing. Now to put some background on us I talked to this pair almost weekly, they were the siblings I never had. This ghosting was weird. So I go over to their place to see if they could talk in person.\n\nI get there and see both cars are home I knock on the door to avoid waking the baby. My cousins wife swings open the door already with an angry look. I ask to come in. No. I ask if we can talk. No. Finally my cousin appears and his wife runs off crying. I ask why they hadn\u2019t rsvpd back and what\u2019s going on. He tells me I\u2019m a jerk and asshole for not allowing them to bring their kid and they hope my wedding goes terrible. He then closes the door leaving me shocked. To give more background the birth and conception of the kid was rough so this baby is a miracle. I love this kid, just don\u2019t want it at my wedding.\n\nThe day before the wedding my aunt calls demanding why I won\u2019t invite my cousins and why her DIL won\u2019t come out of the house. This causes half of my moms family to not show. The wedding still happened and as said awesome. My moms side of the family still refuses to talk to us and are requesting I apologize to my cousin and his wife for not inviting them and their baby to my wedding.\n\nI really love them and never meant to make them feel this way but this was how I wanted my wedding. So AITA if I stand my ground and not apologize?\n\nEdit: Was just informed a 9 month old isn\u2019t a newborn it\u2019s just a baby so it\u2019s a baby!", "created_utc": 1689199467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14y275g/aita_for_not_letting_my_cousin_bring_their/", "score": 770, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They could have RSVP\u2019d no and got on with their lives instead of creating a ton of drama. OP is NTA", "Okay maybe for an older kid but a newborn? You need that explained?\n\nOkay so like when you give birth to a baby if you\u2019re breastfeeding or even if you\u2019re not that baby has to eat every 2-4 hours and it poops every 45min-2hours 24/7 for the first like 8-12 weeks or so. And breastfeeding means that you\u2019re doing a whole ritual in order to be able to do that because if you skip a feed then your body thinks it doesn\u2019t need to make as much milk and you end up having to do tricks to trick your body into making the right amount again. Not to mention you probably don\u2019t feel comfortable drinking and having to factor that into the equation as well. So that\u2019s just one part of it.\n\nNow consider as OP mentions that this baby is like the result of a lot of trauma and grief prior to its birth. Most people without that kind of background are not going to be comfortable leaving a newborn with even their own closest parent or relative for any amount of time. I didn\u2019t even leave mine alone with my partner for 8 weeks. It does not *feel* right for most people let alone people with trauma who are more anxious parents to begin with. \n\nHaving a newborn is a season of a relationship - my husband and I will have plenty of time alone in a few years when the kids want to play with their friends but for now it\u2019s not a priority beyond our evenings together after bedtime. Where I am from it\u2019s generally understood that childfree excluded basically newborns and breastfeeding infants especially if it\u2019s family and the only person they\u2019d even be okay with leaving the baby with is also at the wedding - because it\u2019s understood that if you ask a woman to choose between leaving her baby with someone and going to an event she won\u2019t be attending. \n\nOP is within her rights to be strict on her rule but you can\u2019t expect like zero repercussions to happen as a result of that choice nobody is entitled to that. Given your close relationship with your cousin and your knowledge of her situation you were absolutely within your rights to do what you did but you really can\u2019t expect her to not be upset about it or to feel like you\u2019re being super inconsiderate of her. Like that is a predictable and reasonable way for her to feel about it. Sometimes we are in right but not necessarily right.", "Also, many times weddings are late in the evening. My kids don\u2019t do well with bedtime without us. It\u2019s disrupts their whole routine since they\u2019re still pretty young. I\u2019ve had instances where one wakes up and is inconsolable until they get their desired parent. So if it\u2019s a more than an hour drive (meaning we\u2019d most likely stay somewhere) and I can\u2019t take my kids, I\u2019m not going to be able to go. \n\nAnd as said before, nursing. Even littles who may be nutritionally okay not to nurse all day may still nurse to sleep. I\u2019ve had 2 that did that and refused anything else.", "I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and we\u2019ve never gotten a babysitter. My parents watch them occasionally but they want us to pick them up by 7:00 and by that point it\u2019s hardly worth it. We don\u2019t personally know any babysitters and have a hard time trusting a stranger to watch our kids. \n\nIn this case I would happily skip the wedding.", "Yep my son was a rainbow baby after a miscarriage that literally almost killed me. Still wouldn't have dragged him to a no kids wedding, or thrown a fit about him not being invited.", "Well you would be wrong about that assumption.  As most parents with babies under three months do use childcare. Whether it's family, or a close friend.", "I actually did breastfeed every single one of my four kids. It's called a breast pump, or formula supplementation, and a bottle.\n\nDid you hurt yourself with that reach?", "I can kind of excuse the cousin-in-law\u2019s behavior, sleep deprivation plus post-pregnancy hormones can be a real wild roller-coaster (my cousin did and said some crazy stuff after her first pregnancy), and please don\u2019t take this as me saying how she handled things is ok by any means, but her cousin was a real huge AH by telling her he hoped it went horrible, shutting the door in her face, and then dragging their family into it. \n\nOP is by no means the AH, and she should be glad the illogical showed themselves out.\n\nETA: I just read that the baby was 9 months old at the time of the wedding, so retract my post-partum hormone statement.

A baby in a room of germy people.  Not a great idea.\n\nAnd I was never even all that COVID-paranoid.\n\nHowever, OP is NTA because the bride & groom decide how they want their day to be.

And the dad is just trying to keep his head above water and support her. Chances are they don't realize it. But it causes feelings to get extra hurt and reactions to be extra big and things to be taken extra personally. I struggled with it for years and now, after being treated for it and feeling SO much better, I'd never react that way. But back then? I'd cry my eyes out and think you must hate me for not fully including me and not realizing I can't leave my breastfed baby at home and the baby can't sleep anywhere but their own room, (brain goes etc etc etc). It doesn't make sense. I was convinced my husbands family all hated me. They definitely dont. But it might be worth reaching out to your cousin to see if they're OK. If they are still ridiculous after that, then that's not on you. But I know if it were me I'd like someone to reach out that one more time.\n\nCan't speak for all the people who didnt go over it who aren't them though. THOSE people are the real AHs.", "They\u2019re the ones that need to rectify this, they\u2019re the assholes, not you. You did nothing wrong, you should stop acting like the villain for simply having a simple boundary and not letting those assholes trample all over them.", "Firstly, NTA. You were clear in the invite and they chose to take umbrage. What I don\u2019t understand is your aunt and moms side of the family saying you need to invite them. Was it they meant you need to include the baby as well? If so, not their place to do so and I\u2019m so exhausted of reading what people should do to meet other people\u2019s sense of entitlement.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here.  If this is the only major incident like this then apologize.   You may not understand or even agree with them, but for whatever reason it hurt them.   We don\u2019t always get to decide whether or actions hurt someone else or even whether they should have.   Sometimes you just do it to save the relationship.   My grandpa said used to say, \u201cyou can be right or you can be married.   Sometimes you gotta realize that even doing what everyone agrees is the right thing will hurt the one you love.   In that situation you have to decide if you love them enough to humble yourself and realize that people have emotions, emotions aren\u2019t rational and really don\u2019t care about if it it was a right or wrong action.\u201d\n\nI know the vast majority of people will hate this response but I have many close people to me that I have apologized for things where I wasn\u2019t necessarily \u201cwrong\u201d.

Maybe for the family members you like and get along with and not the whack job/alcoholic/racist cousin/uncle/stepbrother. It's whatever the people getting married want to to be.", "Since you confidently state I'm wrong, have any evidence for that?\n\nAnd let's exclude family since there is a reasonable chance that many of them would be at the wedding", "I cannot imagine leaving a newborn that long, especially when nursing but each to their own.", "Omg the baby is 9 months??? I totally did not catch that. Perhaps then, it was more the cousin having a tantrum at having to make parental sacrifices. Who knows.", "Yeah. OP edited the post recently, they were unaware 9 months didn\u2019t count as a \u201cnewborn\u201d and used the wrong description", "Yeah. Unfortunately I have a similar feeling that this kid is gonna have an entire crowd behind them giving excuses for their every mistake. How more family members didn\u2019t tell the mother to get over herself is a mystery to me", "Apparently the baby is 9 months old", "See that\u2019s the thing. You just declined the invite. You didn\u2019t use it as a way to call put the couple for whatever rules they\u2019ve put on (eg child free). I don\u2019t understand why people get bent out of shape over it, like just don\u2019t go. It\u2019s okay to miss a wedding just as it\u2019s okay not to invite everyone or set a rule about kids.", "True but also mom could be their only food supply. For myself I wouldn\u2019t have the issue with food since I bottle fed formula but I\u2019d be uncomfortable leaving the baby with someone other than family and family would be at the wedding. I don\u2019t talk to my side so if it was my spouse\u2019s family\u2019s event we wouldn\u2019t have another option.", "tbf whats even the point of going to a wedding party with a baby glued to ur breast. just the ceremony if its not a 5 hrs drive should be enough since thats the symbolic part, is what i think.", "Unless it's your own siblings wedding, the odds of more than a quarter of your family being present are slim to none. Meaning that most likely at least 3/4's of their family would not be in attendance. \n\nAlso I'm not your secretary. Some random person in a Reddit thread is most definitely not worth the time, and effort it would take to do the leg work on that information for you. You want to know the numbers, look it up yourself. \n\nAlso this child was a nine month old baby. Not a newborn. So it's a completely moot point either way.", "The baby is nine months old. No one wants a screaming child to interrupt a special day.", "This baby was not a newborn. It was nine months old.", "It\u2019s an \u201cI believe my baby is a miracle, and everyone should think so too\u201d entitled parent situation. It won\u2019t go away and they\u2019ll just double down", "I'd suggest putting this info in the main post. 9 months old is old enough to be left with a babysitter if they choose. NTA", "So it was young enough that it wouldn\u2019t be eating real food and you wouldn\u2019t be charged for it by the caterer, which was your reasoning for excluding children.", "Most parents have left their baby at least briefly by 9mos. On the other hand it\u2019s not uncommon especially for stay at home and/or lactating parents to still have never left their babies. It\u2019s very common for lactating moms to have difficulty pumping milk for later use and to have bandied who will not take the bottle. Sometimes a parent\u2019s bond is so tight that it feels like their baby is a part of them, so it might feel to her like a part of her is undesirable and unwanted. Some of those sort of  folks can be really anxious about leaving baby, especially if they have nobody they trust available. When that level of anxiety is present, it is often paired with a Perinatal Mood Disorder of some kind, which could also explain the strong emotions and tearfulness about the whole situation.\n\nAlso, like others have recommended, I highly suggest editing your post. There is a huuuuuuge difference between a newborn and a 9mo, developmentally. It honestly changed my opinion from maybe ETA to definitely NTA. Newborns are like little meatloaves. Especially if they\u2019re nursing will happily stay in mom\u2019s arms at the breast (which is basically where they belong, biologically speaking) and barely noticeable if parents are attuned. At 9mos on the other hand many babies are crawling, if not cruising, eating solids, grabbing food to feed themselves, and are not content without lots of play and interaction. Totally different picture. \n\nThe first year or two of parenthood is insanely stressful, as is planning a wedding. Ya\u2019ll were both in a super vulnerable state at the time. I hope you can salvage the relationship.", "You did everything right. Of course the kids grandma is going to take their side, it doesn't matter to her that they're the assholes, just ignore her. It would be a silly thing to end a friendship over, but you can't make them get over themselves. Maybe message them asking how they are, do they want to hangout sometime ect.", "I didn\u2019t let kids come to my wedding either because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay for all the extra dinners. Nobody got mad about it though.", "Yeesh that's even worse then. OP is absolutely not TA here.", "Than it\u2019s not a newborn and they were right to not invite the child. I was assuming that it was just born.", "Yes and OP only clarified that after I asked in a different comment. Don't jump down my throat for OP not knowing how to use words properly", "Not really. That's the parents issue.", "9m olds eat real food though.", "9 month olds eat real food", "Definitely not, and these people are ridiculous to be making such a big deal out of this. I mean, splitting up the family to the point where half of them don\u2019t even go? They sound like the most insufferable \u201cit\u2019s all about me\u201d people ever.", "Yeah, but the parents would probably bring food they know the baby likes. It wouldn\u2019t be eating the catered food."]}
