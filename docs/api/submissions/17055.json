Then, older sister goes upstairs and goes into my room talks about how \u201cnasty\u201d it is and tears my vinyl records off the wall and throws them in the dumpster I\u2019m not gonna lie by then I was cussing yelling and honestly ready to fight. \n\nSecurity hears me and comes to see what is going on and my sisters leave the house my mom comes home super angry that they would do something like this especially since she wasn\u2019t at home but she was mad at me also for causing a scene that could cause her to get kicked out out which I totally understand I just wasn\u2019t thinking at the time. \n\nALSO younger sister (28) apparently lied to everyone and said i had a guy in the house and that\u2019s the only reason older sister and god daughter were there. \n\nEDIT:::: idk why I didn\u2019t mention this before but it was 11 something at night and ALSO I\u2019m totally forgetting these important details sorry guys they ALSO live in the same apartment complex as us which was to me idiotic on their part\n\nAnyways\u2026..AITA?", "created_utc": 1683895647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fk76s/aita_for_cursing_my_sisters_out_infront_of_my/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
