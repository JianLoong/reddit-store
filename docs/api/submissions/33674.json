{"id": 33674, "submission_id": "18pml4o", "title": "AITA for making my daughter write an apology letter over comments about Christmas gifts?", "selftext": "My husband (32M) and I (33F) have 4 children (13F, 11M, 8M and 2M), our two oldest are our daughter Kayla (13) and our son Liam (11). Every year, we give the kids money to spend on other family members, this year they got $100 to spend on each sibling, $50 on us, their cousins, and their grandparents and $30 on aunts and uncles. The 3 oldest can pick stuff that they think the others would like fairly easily, obviously, we substantially helped our 2 year old pick gifts. \r  \n\r  \nEarlier this year, Liam saw a tiktok of some guy going to a thrift store and finding basketball merch, Liam plays basketball and wanted to see if he could do the same and he found some really nice stuff. Ever since then, Liam has been a huge fan of thrifting. He has found $50 or $100 items for a few bucks. Liam also wanted to thrift gifts this year, and the vast majority of the gifts he got were thrifted, this also means he was able to get each person quite many gifts, my husband and I had to get some big black trash bags to fit them all. \r  \n\r  \nThe kids all shop for Christmas gifts seperately, so they didn't know which stores each other were going to. Last night, we were in the living room watching The Polar Express and my husband had paused the movie to make hot cocoa during the hot cocoa song/scene. We had started talking about Christmas and Liam had mentioned he got some gifts at various different thrift stores earlier in the day. Kayla said that was \"gross\" and \"you better not have gotten me any gifts there\", she said that she was \"above that filth\". \r  \n\r  \nI will admit, we are quite priveleged and live in a priveleged area, so when my daughter said that, I asked where she learned that, she said her friends said similar things. I told her that was not nice and she needed to apologize, she refused and we started arguing until my husband intervened and said he would come up with something. After talking to me once the movie was over, we agreed that Kayla should have to write an apology letter to Liam for insulting him and why thrifting can be a good thing to do. She said she wasn't going to do it and has been aruging with us all day over it, I asked some friends who are also parents of teenagers if I was out of line and got mixed results, AITA?", "created_utc": 1703389167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pml4o/aita_for_making_my_daughter_write_an_apology/", "score": 406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For the sake of society and your own sanity, that behavior needs to be corrected before it gets out of hand. An apology letter and making her do research on the benefits of thrifting is a great idea. Also props to Liam for using his brain on how to get the most for the money he had.", "Simple, don\u2019t argue with her. If she is that adamant that she not be given \u201cfilth\u201d then she obviously doesn\u2019t need gifts.. because deity forbid she get something second hand.  Presents are not mandatory. They are GIFTS", "NTA. Whilst it is great you have been able to provide your family a privileged life, it is important that they know that privelege is privelege and not everyone has it. They need to understand how to be grateful of what they have and to not look down on those who have less. Also recycling/reusing/repurposing should be a priority for all, regardless of privelege. Your son's got the right idea.", "NTA. Kayla heard this from her friends... where did they hear it from? Their parents. That might explain the mixed results.\n\nWhen you grow up with privilege it's easy to lack empathy or understanding of how normal people live. As a parent, it's part of your job to make sure your kids understand and appreciate what they have.", "ESH. Your daughter is spoiled and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve done anything to reign this in. Each of your children gets $400 worth of Christmas presents from their siblings alone PLUS whatever gifts you as parents purchase PLUS gifts from extended family. Of course this will skew her sense of privilege and entitlement. Sure, writing an apology letter is something but it won\u2019t touch the larger issue. In tiger words, forcing her to write a letter one time is no substitute for parenting. So what will you do to ensure your daughter doesn\u2019t grow up looking down on everyone who doesn\u2019t receive hundreds or even thousands of dollars of presents every Christmas?", "NTA; she\u2019s acting like a spoiled snob.", "Okay so - NTA; your intentions are good, and you're not wrong that your daughter is in dire need of an attitude adjustment. I would gently recommend considering the best way to go about this though.\n\nShe *does* owe her brother an apology. She may find herself at some point in life where she is accepting gifts of \"lesser caliber\" than her standard prefers, learning to accept them graciously and gratefully is a lesson she needs to acquire. I think you should have a conversation with her about that. I also think it would be beneficial to ask her why thrifting is \"gross\" and what \"filth\" is involved.\n\nCome to this conversation prepared: talk about vintage things that can be found via thrifting, talk about restoring high-value things (cooking pots and pans aren't the sexiest example but they are a great one - you can find $$$ cookware on the cheap because people don't know their value or they don't know how to restore things into good condition). Talk about how gifts don't always have to be brand new to have value (and how many items will still have value with age - or more value, because of age).\n\nYour daughter sounds like she's gotten infected with snobbery. She owes your son an apology, and she needs to learn some life lessons, but I don't know if the letter will teach her the lesson the way you want it to. (Reiterating again though, Liam *is* owed an apology and you should supervise that in some way to make sure it is an actual apology, and not one she can make passive aggressive digs with - a letter isn't a bad idea from that perspective.)", "Are yall the assholes for being a united front and being great parents?\n\nNta.", "ESH. Your daughter is the AH, however kids can be AH at times, and you seem surprised so hopefully this is just a phase.\n\nYou're not the AH, however you need to realize a forced apology isn't a real apology. It's just something people do to get the pressure off them so others will leave them alone.\n\nThe arguing is an issue. I didn't always agree with my parents, but I didn't argue with them when I was 13. That wasn't something I even saw as an option. If this is a new behavior you might want to get a handle on it now.", "Ok so YTA\u2026but\u2026forcing someone to apologize isn\u2019t helpful. Imagine being forced to apologize to your husband for something you don\u2019t feel sorry for. However, it is problematic. And while I think forcing your child to apologize for something she isn\u2019t sorry for is the wrong way to approach it, the idea is right. What about showing your child the benefits of thrifting? It\u2019s good for the environment, you can buy more things with the same amount of money, sometimes items we love are discontinued and we can get them second hand, it\u2019s better for labor laws in other countries, etc. Heck if privileged is an issue, there\u2019s thrifted luxury items like The RealReal that could show her even Prada can be thrifted. Forcing her to write an apology letter: YTA, wanting to help your daughter understand a different perspective: NTA.", "NTA.  So many people utilize thrift stores and have found amazing things.  Besides the apology and having her gain some understanding of just how fortunate she is to be able to only have new things, why not go to to the thrift Store Hauls subreddit and show her some of the amazing collectibles and vintage clothing that people post there? For example, just today I saw a post for some laptop backpack that was marked $7.99 but sells for like $170 online. People find real gemstone jewelry for next to nothing. She needs a chance to realize that there are things of real value that get donated every day because someone doesn't want it or doesn't want to bother with finding out what great aunt Mildred had before they clean out her home, you know?", "NTA. To turn it into more of a teaching moment you could require the apology letter to mention 5 positives/benefits of thrift stores?", "ESH. You are right that your daughter\u2019s attitude needs correction, but it sounds like you\u2019re not doing a lot to help. It\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re blessed and can do all of this, but daughter is growing entitled and a forced letter won\u2019t fix that. Has she ever served/volunteered? Has she ever made a gift or had to work for money for gifts, like babysitting?", "Mixed feelings here. The only time I give thrifted gifts is when the theme is thrift. The ONLY exception to this is collectibles. (If I know a person collects cows, corningware, etc).\n\nThrifted is still another word for \u201cused.\u201d Yes, saying \u201cabove that filth\u201d was rude. I would still be a little annoyed to give a gift of high-tech headphones and receive a bag of thrifted things.", "YTA. An apology letter is not enough. A seed has been planted in your daughter that is deeply problematic. A simple performative act will not be enough. And this is no longer just about her brothers feelings. \n\nWho are you raising? Take your daughter to a shelter. Have her volunteer within your community. Invest in her a deeper sense of humility. \n\nYou asked where she learned it and it wasn\u2019t from school. Again.. who are you raising?", "I hate to say it, but YTA which is likely why your daughter\u2019s TA. Children who grow up in privileged environments are unlikely to understand what it\u2019s like for the people who don\u2019t. Giving them hundreds of dollars to spend on other\u2019s doesn\u2019t equate developing empathy. They didn\u2019t have to earn that money. Giving it up means nothing to them because it was never theirs to begin with. And I\u2019m guessing that throughout the year they get whatever new things they need whenever they want. \n\nI\u2019m amazed that Liam was able to overcome those circumstances. It\u2019s going to be very hard at this point to get a teenage girl out of that mindset due to the peer pressure, but it can probably be done. I wouldn\u2019t force her to apologize as that seems to make her dig in to her views. Rather, I\u2019d approach it with the empathy you\u2019re trying to develop. I\u2019d also own up to you role in all of this, apologizing to her for allowing her to live in a relative bubble.", "You can\u2019t be upset she doesn\u2019t want a 2nd hand gift for Xmas, she could\u2019ve expressed it differently tho", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
