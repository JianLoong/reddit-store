He has two identical twin daughters with his ex-wife who are 9 years old. For the purpose of this post, I'll call them Isabelle and Maria. \n\nI struggle to tell the girls apart so my husband gave Isabelle a pink wrist band and Maria a blue one so I could tell them apart. \n\nI'm currently 5 months pregnant with our son and one of my biggest cravings is snickers bars. This is an issue because Maria is allergic to nuts, so I usually eat them in my car, our bedroom or the backyard to avoid contamination. Maria's allergy is quite severe and she knows she isn't supposed to eat anything with nuts in them.\n\nOn Friday, I was sat in my bedroom going ham on some mini snickers bars while watching Netflix when one of the twins came in my room. I asked who she was and she said she was Isabelle and she asked to come sit by me. I didn't even know she was at home but she told me that her dad dropped her off with the keys and he went back to work which is something he does often without telling me. I checked the wrist band to make sure it was Isabelle and she had a pink one so I didn't think twice and I let her sit by me. \n\nShe took a piece of chocolate from me and ate it which to me confirmed I was with Isabelle because Maria knows she's not supposed to have Snickers. Turns out I was wrong and the girls had swapped wrist bands to play a joke on me and she immediately started experiencing a reaction. Thankfully I had an epi pen and I drove her to the ER and called my husband. He called their mother who was infuriated and she started yelling at me in the ER waiting area and I ended up having a panic attack. Maria ended up being fine and the girls came clean about wanting to play a prank on me. Maria hasn't had a reaction for the past few years so she's saying she forgot how bad and serious they were.\n\nMy husband is on my side and he's saying that the Maria is old enough to know she shouldn't be eating any nut products and it's not my fault I thought she was Isabelle but their mother is saying that I shouldn't have any nut products in the house that could tempt Maria and since I struggle to tell them apart, the smart thing wouldve been for me not to allow either of them to have the chocolate. She's now demanding that the girls aren't to be left alone with me and other family members are berating me for being careless. I just feel so awful and terrible and I would like an unbiased outside perspective on the situation. AITA for giving my stepdaughter a snickers bar?\n\nEdit: I'm **autistic** so I struggle with faces.

Not only did you already attempt to confirm which individual you were giving the candy to, but you were explicitly lied to when you did so. Maria knowingly ingested a nut product under her own volition. She is not a wild animal who can\u2019t control herself if you have nuts in the house. Honestly, are they going to keep her on a leash in the grocery store because she might be tempted by the peanut butter? 9 years old is old enough to start managing her own allergy.", "As a mom of twins and I have the nut allergy I\u2019m going with NTA. They are kids but they know better about her allergy. People in my family avoid nuts but also know if they eat them they have to wash and brush their teeth before coming near me, even my 6 yr old twins. Dad should have let you know that he was dropping 1 off and who it was so you could prepare/be aware and he needs a better system then rubber bands. I would also work on ways to learn the difference btwn them bc even identical twins have certain characteristics that make them different.", "NtA. The kids are 9. They know they are allergic to nuts and should be careful. They took sooo many steps to be in the wrong it's crazy. Switch bands, LIE and SHE ate the bar, you did not offer it. She should have known better. And it sounds like she's taking it as a lesson learned. \n\nThe mother is now blaming you because you let her blame you. The kids are not babies. They know better but chose to do this. I acknowledge that they are still young but this does not take away their responsibility in this.\n\nIf the kids had played this prank at school and had the nuts at school, what would be the consequences?", "NTA This was an honest mistake on your part. The root cause is that the kids were lying, but unfortunately, kids lie. As a parent, you have to account for that possibility. I recommend you don't give nuts to either one just to play it safe. Their mom is overreacting, probably as an excuse to get on to you. If their dad is okay with nuts in the house, that's the end of it.", "NTA. You took every precaution you could to make sure you were talking to Isabelle, and Maria knows she cannot eat nut products, so it's all on them for pulling that prank.\n\n  \nAlso, the part where their mom says you shouldn't have had any nut products in the house is kind of ridiculous. While 9yo is admittedly a very young age, it's not too young that they wouldn't understand that Maria shouldn't eat nut products under any circumstances, and neither is it too young that they cannot resist the urge of eating putting everything they find to their mouths.\n\nIf Maria had eaten Snickers in your absence because you hadn't made sure she couldn't reach them, that would've been a different story. But you made extra sure you weren't letting Maria have the Snickers.", "NTA. It sounds like you did (everything you should have) a lot to minimise the risk. \n\nI would question whether the mums reaction would have been the same if, for instance, the twins played the same prank on a friend's mum.\n\n-------\nEdit (after valid point below, I've left original wording in brackets cos I don't know how to do strikethrough)", "Soft NTA. I wonder how many of the commenters who say you should be able to tell them apart have spent time with young identical twins. I know bio moms who can\u2019t tell their identical twins apart. Some identical twins have clear tells, but not all. \n\nAt 9 she should know better about not eating things she is allergic to, but clearly can\u2019t be trusted on that so in the future just eat the snickers outside of the house. Or not at all\u2026 I am currently pregnant and it isn\u2019t that hard not to give into cravings.", "NTA, I think you've made a reasonable effort to deal with her peanut allergy by eating it in a separate area. You weren't malicious in trying to get her to eat peanuts or something like that, this was an honest mistake. Ultimately Maria needs to be responsible for handling her own allergy as well, because the entire world can't be made free of peanuts for her. She's young but she's not a baby, she should be able to look after herself at a basic level at age 9.", "NTA.\n\nStep daughters are old enough to know what they can/can't eat.\n\nHowever, they are also young and very shortsighted in thinking.  Maybe need to come up with a better system.", "NTA- at 9 years old she is old enough to know she is allergic to peanuts and manage her food consumption. Especially if it has been drilled into her, which from her moms reaction it sounds like it has.", "NTA. A 9 yr old is old enough to not deliberately ask for something she is allergic to.", "I\u2019m kind of cracking up at the image of a pregnant woman housing snickers lying in bed demanding WHO ARE YOU", "NTA, but this is also correct:\n\n>their mother is saying that I shouldn't have any nut products in the house that could tempt Maria and since I struggle to tell them apart, the smart thing wouldve been for me not to allow either of them to have the chocolate.\n\nIt's not just about temptation, the risk of cross contamination with a nut allergy is just too high, you shouldn't have any nut products in the house at all. I also agree with their mother that you shouldn't be watching them going forward, because you're clearly not equipped to do so. This isn't meant as an attack and it doesn't mean you're not a good stepmother, but if you can't tell the girls apart, it does unfortunately mean you can't properly care for them by yourself.", "NTA - they are 9, they are old enough to know better and actively deceived you. The consequence should be that neither one of them can have your candies. Enjoy your snickers in your room and don\u2019t share with either of them.", "NTA - the children tried to play a joke and it went wrong. You\u2019re not at fault for thinking it was the other twin.", "NTA, they were pulling a prank and purposely deceiving you. Plus 9 is old enough to know what you\u2019re eating.  But you should learn to tell them apart, they shouldn\u2019t need wrist bands for the rest of their lives.", "nta ... i guess thr kids wont pull that prank again anytime soon", "NTA. I\u2019m the mom of a peanut-allergic kid, who well before she was nine years old knew better than to eat something without asking if it was safe for her. Heck, I can remember my daughter asking me as a preschooler at her own sister\u2019s birthday party if the candy in the pi\u00f1ata was safe for her (of course it was)! OP kept the peanuts in her room, away from her stepdaughter. It\u2019s not her fault the stepdaughter played a trick on her. Accidents happen, and that\u2019s why you always keep epinephrine on hand when you have a peanut allergy.", "Yes, it would have been better if you had just not kept snickers in the house at all, and to not let any eat them at all. But there is no way for you to actually tell, and you had trust in them to know about their allergies. \n\nEven though they are nine years old they should be responsible and take care of their allergies. The situation was very severe and i see why your family and SO's ex was berating you for it. Also, may I know if Maria has had any allergic reactions in the past? And how severe were they?\n\nBut you should have also thought about it because these identical twin pranks are very common, and it was always a possibility. You could have explicitly told Isabelle(Maria in diguise) that these have peanuts and if they are not actually Isabelle they should not eat it.\n\nNTA. But it could have gone wayy worse and you could have handled it better, but its not **entirely** your fault.", "NTA. My daughter is also allergic to nuts. I still have nuts in my house, I just make sure she's not into the bag", "NTA but you invite some risk with keeping nut-products, especially candy with small children, and the twin layer, around.\n\nShould a 9yo know better? yes.  But risk is risk.  Mugging is illegal but we still recommend you don't walk alone down dark streets.", "NTA - The girls are old enough to know and understand that Maria can't have peanuts. They are also enough to know they shouldn't be lieing and the importance of the bracelet...which they did..they lied about there names and switched the bracelets to help confirm the lie they were going to tell..they new you would look at the bracelet to make sure.\n\nYOU TOOK ALL THE STEP TO IDENTIFY THE KIDS - Your husband and his family know you have trouble recognizing their faces and why...they put a procedure in place to help you identify which child was which..you went throw all the steps..you asked the kid her name and you checked the color of the bracelet...it's not your fault the kids decided the play \"a joke\" on you. \n\nI mean maybe going forward you could ban peanut products in the house as an extra pro-caution but this one wasn't your fault and you weren't neglectful.", "I would say that ESH but with your edit I realize my response would have been rude. It is very import to be able to tell these children apart without the use of wristbands. You are actively trying, that\u2019s great! I would refrain from eating nuts in the house period. Cross contamination can happen anywhere. If you don\u2019t wash your hands thoroughly after having nut products on your hands and touch her, it can cause a reaction. It just dangerous and should be avoided for the safety of this little girl. SHE IS DEFINITELY OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW THIS WAS WRONG! I do not think you are completely to blame because the kids were being cheeky and it almost cost one twin their life. Hopefully this experience will make them think about the serious consequences of their actions. I would talk to your husband about possible reprimand for their dangerous prank. As for the ex-wife, I do understand why she was so upset. It doesn\u2019t give her the right to cause you to have panic attacks. I\u2019m sure you feel as bad about it as your husband does. This is preventable, and this situation should be a lesson for everyone involved.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, NTA!", "NTA. She is old enough to know better. She also ate candy that she knows she's not supposed to have. You would never have let her eat the candy if you knew it was Maria.", "even if you weren't autistic twins are hard to tell which is which", "YTA for eating stuff with nuts in the house when someone who lives there has a life threatening allergy to nuts. Its so easy for something to happen with cross contamination, that you're playing with fire by eating nuts in the house at all.", "> their mother is saying that I shouldn't have any nut products in the house that could tempt Maria and since I struggle to tell them apart, the smart thing wouldve been for me not to allow either of them to have the chocolate.\n\nI agree w/ this, but imo mistakes happen and kids are dumb so NTA.", "NTA. Your stepdaughters are for tricking you. She's suffering consequences of her own lying. You tried to determine which kid it was to the best of your ability", "NTA. I\u2019ve nannied a girl who has a peanut allergy less severe than this since her third birthday (she is now 6). Our first Halloween together, when she was *still 3,* when we went trick or treating she would say \u201ctrick or treat, does this have peanuts? I\u2019m allergic.\u201d To this day when eating something new it\u2019s part of her process to ask me to check (she\u2019s still learning to read) if an unfamiliar food or candy is safe for her to eat. Hopefully you guys have been straight with her that you\u2019ve been eating her allergen in certain spaces where she\u2019s not around, but really, at 9 she can distinctly know what a snickers is/looks like and have the wherewithal to know it\u2019s dangerous for her to eat them. You\u2019re not at fault for trusting your step daughters not to lie to you, and you\u2019re not at fault for thinking your step daughter with a bad allergy might be wise enough not to blindly take candy that might be harmful to her. You did all the right things when something went horribly wrong, too. Try not to feel too bad, accidents happen, and I know she\u2019s 9 but this is an FAFO lesson that hopefully will keep her safer in the future. Better this than sneaking into your stash when no one else is around.", "NTA. First, prosopagnosia (face blindness) is a legitimate condition, especially for those who are on the spectrum. Second, those girls are absolutely old enough to understand why their prank could have turned out deadly for Maria. I really wonder if their mother didn't subtly encourage them to do this, and if it was a good way to stick it to you out of her dislike of you. I don't know if this is the case, but I suspect that it is. Finally, I would follow the recommendation of not keeping any nut products in the house. I know this is a hardship on you, but the problem is that once a person has had an allergic reaction of this kind, the likelihood is that their sensitivity will increase, to the point where even touching peanut dust could set her off. Sadly, I suspect that the mother is hoping for such an event so that she can heap more blame on you. Protect yourself (and your pregnancy). Keep the nut products out of the house and out of Maria's proximity. And good luck with this precarious family situation.", "NTA. The kid wasn\u2019t even supposed to be home for Christ sake. You\u2019re allowed to enjoy a treat in your own home. Maria is also old enough to know that she cannot have nuts. If her parents haven\u2019t taught her that yet, that\u2019s on them.", "totally unrelated \u2014 you\u2019re 25? and he\u2019s 42? that\u2019s not ringing any alarm bells in your head at all? \n\nESH btw. the girls should have known better than to play that type of prank, especially when someone\u2019s health is at risk. you should try to think of less fallible ways to tell these girls apart, especially if you\u2019re their stepmom.", "The people on this sub shaming you for not being able to tell those girls apart are something else. I grew up with girls who were twins so identical they could fool their own parents when they wanted to. All the way up through high school they pulled pranks like that, even on their own mother. No one could tell them apart. I never knew for absolutely sure which one I was talking to. It made it a little hard to be friends with them sometimes but looking back I think they really loved the little bubble they made for themselves with that. \nEventually they started having their hair differently, in our 20s (lol one of them wanted to get 'the Rachel' and the other one couldn't be bothered with the styling) and we all breathed a sigh of relief. They still look so much alike it's crazy, though.\nNTA. This was a mistake, not an asshole move. You're entitled to your cravings. Baby wants snickers. But these are children, who make bad decisions. So you're going to have to come up with a way to keep anything that endangers them out of reach, all the time. They're going to make dumb decisions again, and kids' dumb decisions can be life threatening. That's why they need you to be the better thinker.", "I'm going with slight YTA. If her allergy is severe enough you shouldn't really have it in the house, let alone give some to her sister.\n\nI think everyone needs to lay off the fact that you can't tell them apart though. I have twin step brothers, and my mom could only tell them apart by their glasses until they hit puberty.  They're in their 30s now and look different enough.  My mom is just bad with faces, it didn't mean she didn't care about them.\n\nWe have pictures of them as children that aren't labeled on the back, and some of them my dad doesn't even know who is who, it's kind of a running joke.", "NTA-you made sure to check which daughter it was and Maria is supposed to know that she can't have nut products, they switched the bands, tricked you and ate it, the girls brought this upon themselves and hopefully will learn from this that it's not funny.", "ESH- So I understand having a craving but you live in a home with someone who has a severe allergy and her allergy trumps your cravings. You shouldn't have peanut products in the house, and you definitely should not be giving peanut products to EITHER twin. I'm assuming they spend a lot of time together and could be in close contact leading to potential dangerous contamination. I just don't think you thought this through at all being giving it to her. Also you're marrying this man and you can't tell his children apart? I would understand if they're like babies but they're 9... I'm sure there are ways to tell them apart outside of having them wear wrist bands. \n\nNow the girls obviously should not have pulled this prank on you, that is not your fault and hopefully Maria learns from this experience never to do dumb stuff like this again. But now my question is, why did they want to pull this prank on you in the first place? Do you and the step-daughters not get along? I feel like there's some information missing here about ya'll relationship... Mom should not be putting this solely on you but unfortunately this is the consequence of poor decision making on your part.", "ESH\n\nThe girls are old enough to know better than to deliberately expose Maria to her allergen but you shouldn't have brought it into the house.

He hasn\u2019t reacted in 7 years. He knows better than to eat nut products and has for years. This was a very dangerous joke to play and I really hope she learned her lesson. The only thing I will say, because you struggle telling them apart, maybe their mom was right just in regards to not keeping nut products in the house. I may be overly cautious but I don\u2019t keep things that will cause a reaction. However, I know allergy moms who keep all the normal foods in their house and just exercise caution, so do what works for you guys!", "I'm pregnant right now, I get cravings.

Pregnancy cravings are no joke and if she wasn\u2019t supposed to be home I can\u2019t blame you for not hiding in your car to eat then instead of the empty house. 9 is definitely old enough to know not to eat something that they are allergic to. \n\nOn the other hand, I do think you should be able to tell the difference between them, but you say you\u2019re autistic and I understand that. She shouldn\u2019t have lied so she could get something she knew would harm her. You confirmed multiple times that she was not the allergic twin. \n\nI do think you need to try harder to identify between the two, though. I know it\u2019s hard, but to prevent further situations like this and also just to validate that they are two separate people.

He has two identical twin daughters with his ex-wife who are 9 years old. For the purpose of this post, I'll call them Isabelle and Maria. \n\nI struggle to tell the girls apart so my husband gave Isabelle a pink wrist band and Maria a blue one so I could tell them apart. \n\nI'm currently 5 months pregnant with our son and one of my biggest cravings is snickers bars. This is an issue because Maria is allergic to nuts, so I usually eat them in my car, our bedroom or the backyard to avoid contamination. Maria's allergy is quite severe and she knows she isn't supposed to eat anything with nuts in them.\n\nOn Friday, I was sat in my bedroom going ham on some mini snickers bars while watching Netflix when one of the twins came in my room. I asked who she was and she said she was Isabelle and she asked to come sit by me. I didn't even know she was at home but she told me that her dad dropped her off with the keys and he went back to work which is something he does often without telling me. I checked the wrist band to make sure it was Isabelle and she had a pink one so I didn't think twice and I let her sit by me. \n\nShe took a piece of chocolate from me and ate it which to me confirmed I was with Isabelle because Maria knows she's not supposed to have Snickers. Turns out I was wrong and the girls had swapped wrist bands to play a joke on me and she immediately started experiencing a reaction. Thankfully I had an epi pen and I drove her to the ER and called my husband. He called their mother who was infuriated and she started yelling at me in the ER waiting area and I ended up having a panic attack. Maria ended up being fine and the girls came clean about wanting to play a prank on me. Maria hasn't had a reaction for the past few years so she's saying she forgot how bad and serious they were.\n\nMy husband is on my side and he's saying that the Maria is old enough to know she shouldn't be eating any nut products and it's not my fault I thought she was Isabelle but their mother is saying that I shouldn't have any nut products in the house that could tempt Maria and since I struggle to tell them apart, the smart thing wouldve been for me not to allow either of them to have the chocolate. She's now demanding that the girls aren't to be left alone with me and other family members are berating me for being careless. I just feel so awful and terrible and I would like an unbiased outside perspective on the situation. AITA for giving my stepdaughter a snickers bar?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.\n\nYou doubled check to make sure that you weren\u2019t giving a snickers to the wrong one.

I\u2019m glad your husband is on your side.", "NTA- the girls purposely tricked you. And at 9 Maria should be responsible enough to manage her allergies. You eating a candy bar in your own room should be a safe place for you to do so. I bet the girls won\u2019t swap places with each other again. \nMy daughter at 4 had allergies and could tell someone what she could and couldn\u2019t eat.

If a 9 year old can't control herself enough not to put her life in danger for sweets, you having a nut free home isn't going to keep her safe out in the world", " NTA.", "NTA. At nine she should know not to have nuts. You didn't even know they were in the house until she walked in on you eating your snickers. Doesn't even sound like you gave her the chocolate but she took it and ate it of her own accord. It's so easy to do when you have a nut allergy. My cousin has a severe peanut allergy and ate a granola bar containing nuts a few years ago - he ended up in the hospital. He looked for \"may contain peanuts\" on the label and when he didn't see it he thought it was ok. Of course peanuts was listed in the ingredients. It was his own fault and a hard lesson unfortunately.

But a mature child would not be eating something she knows she's allergic to.

You.", "how do you not hear someone come into the house? they are 9 not 19 their whereabouts should be well known to their caretakers", "Possible, but also, a lot of twins just love the whole switching prank. The fact the kids admitted it so easily makes me inclined to think she just forgot that she has full on anaphylaxis.", "Exactly. 9 year olds are not known for good judgement", "honestly there's no reason for there to be any evil ploy from anyone here, kids do this kind of stuff because to them its funny. obviously your guess isn't impossible, but honestly, thinking of my own two daughters i could perfectly imagine them trying something like this if they could get away with it just for the fun of fooling someone else.", "That's horrendous but fits!", "Yeah, so no one else thinks that Daddys pregnant 25year old wife pisses the ex off? 17 years difference....seriously? You know the ex-wife despises her! The ex wife is going to fuck with her as long as she stays around and you know the kids hear all about it either directly or overhearing things. I'm sure the ex's body language and attitude is stellar too. Kids are smarter than most think, even at 9. Glad I'm not the OP", "At the idiotic age of 19 I ate an entire peanut butter cookie because I hadn\u2019t \u201chad a reaction\u201d since I was like 5? I genuinely couldn\u2019t remember how bad it was and so many people had told me I\u2019d probably grown out of my allergies. \n\nNever making that mistake again, but I definitely made it. I literally just like couldn\u2019t remember: I was young and it was scary so I think my brain kinda\u2026. made it go away? It could be the same for Maria if it\u2019s been years since she had one. From OP\u2019s own words it sounds like she actually has a pretty decent relationship with them. Maria came clean the second this all happened, and seems to be defending her stepmom over the prank.", "Right. Facial blindness isn\u2019t literally being blind. That\u2019s precisely what I meant and from the edit, it sounded like that\u2019s what OP is referring to.", "I can't tell fraternal twins apart.  It's embarrassing.", "I can usually tell identical twins apart, with one exception \u2014 my husband\u2019s cousins. I\u2019ve known them for about 30 years, and I *still* can\u2019t tell them apart.

Except one time when she wanted to not eat in her car while pregnant.", "Amen. My niece and several other kids in a certain age group all have severe peanut allergies. Their parents admitted to not giving them nuts til toddlerhood. \n\nI gave my daughter peanut butter as soon as possible.  No nut allergies in my house \n\nNow some can't help it, but we did a huge disservice to kids saying to wait for 2 yrs to give them peanut products.", "Meh. Op did due diligence. This isn't like a toddler found her stash. Ya know, the thing about raising kids is actually allowing them to take responsibility for when they eff up. My ex out a paperclip in a light socket when he was 9. He knew he shouldn't have. Does that mean his mother should have gotten rid of all the sockets? Nerp. The kids have to be told that what they did was reckless. Blaming the step parent is leaning over the line of victim blaming. OP isn't the one here that can't be trusted. It's Isabelle and Anna and they need to be taught to own that. OP, the literal victim of a prank, deserves an apology from both the girls and their mother. The truth is, the girls are the ones here at 100% fault. It was 100% avoidable.", "I meant more along the lines of the people who can\u2019t be around someone whose eating peanuts because even breathing it in is bad- Maria was able to sit and talk before grabbing a snickers and then having a reaction. Her reaction is based on whether or not she can eat it -not if she can be around it. If it was an airborne allergy than op would be the a h, but it\u2019s not and Maria had to eat the nut to provoke the reaction- which Maria knew", "It was in her comments before her edit, and that\u2019s how you deal with it - OP is different and everyone handles how they deal with things differently, and as she stated she tries actively to memorize their differences", "Sorry, my nephew was correcting me at 5 years old when I forgot and offered him something he was allergic to. Long story but I live abroad and I don't see him very often. But his parents ensured that he knows what he cannot eat and what to say if he's offered it. \n\nNTA.", "Yeah I mean that part was different- but the part about the kids being let into her home when she thought she was alone and safe to eat her pregnancy craving in peace? That\u2019s unlucky.", "I can't tell two brothers apart unless they're next to each other and I can study them. Face blindness is a bitch.", "That\u2019s wild! I was best friends with a pair of identical twins in middle/high school, so maybe I grew better at identifying.", "I swear, it's like no one actually reads the entire post before commenting.", "And then there\u2019s me. My mom craved things like peanut butter and nuts. The first time I reacted to nuts was while breastfeeding. My allergy is deadly. There are no peanuts in the house. I\u2019m very allergic to all nuts but peanuts I can\u2019t be near at all.", "There is no study thus far that explains nut allergies. It is not about early exposure.

I can\u2019t tell ANYBODY apart.", "Oooh I can definitely imagine being best friends with them would help. I remember my best friends in kindergarten were twins! They didn\u2019t look that alike but their names drove me up the wall, especially since I had a speech impediment.

They don't know why it happens, but there is a strong correlation between early/frequent exposure and not having the allergy.  They do not recommend holding off on giving kids potential allergins though. So the commenter was wrong in that their kids WONT have allergies because of early introduction, but it is better practice to do so.", "Sorry the evidence is there.
