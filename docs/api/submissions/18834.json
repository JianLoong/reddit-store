You may be able to get them to replace the money because of that, which will doubtless be faster than getting restitution from your sister.", "NTA. Your sister is making herself go to jail.

You aren't making her go to prison. Her decision to commit a felony is why she deserves to go to prison", "NTA.

How will she learn if she isn't being held accountable for her actions? I have to ask why she's doing this sort of thing though..? Is she using the money to support an addiction or is she just a selfish dick? If it's the former id give her a chance since addictions cause people to do things they normally wouldn't do. But if it's the latter and she's just a jerk then do what you gotta do. I was assaulted by an uncle and half my family stopped talking to me because I went to the police and had him arrested over it. \"You don't do that to family\" was their argument. My argument was that you don't assault your family... That was over 10 years ago and they still don't talk to me and I don't talk to them. But I have zero regrets. Good luck. I hope you get your money back.", "This isn't really an AITA question. The real victim is the grantor, and you probably have a legal obligation to assist them with the prosecution of the case. Reluctance on your part could be construed as complicity. The way you show this was not a scheme cooked up by you and Sister is by you cooperating fully with the prosecution of the case. Otherwise you could be on the hook for the money, or maybe even sitting in jail with Sister.

This is a pretty serious crime here and it is messing with your education at the same time. She needs to learn the lesson and the only way that will happen is if she gets in trouble for it. She will keep doing this to you or even worse, use your social security number for other things.

I had the chance to charge my partner with grand larceny several years ago and chose not to. He was struggling with a drug problem and even though he stole from me, I wanted him to keep a clean record. Fast forward to today: He was murdered two years ago in a drug related situation. I wonder if going to jail would have made a positive difference to the outcome?  If I had it to do over, I would\u2019ve sent him to jail. Sheltering someone from the consequences of their actions is enabling. I was guilty of enabling him throughout our relationship. I knew about the term enabling, but thought it didn\u2019t apply in the way I was doing things. Yes, I absolutely should have attended meetings for friends and family of drug abusers. I was arrogant and thought I knew everything. I knew nothing. His parents and I enabled him right into an early grave. Consequences might have saved him.", "Are you charging her or did you start an inquiry that lead to the prosecutor pressing charges? She deserves to be punished, but  it maybe out of your hands, especially if a bank is involved.", "NTA\n\nYour sister stole from you and if you don\u2019t stand up for yourself no one will.

I would look at them and say how sad that your sister threw her life away for some money. Sucks being held accountable.", "NTA. If your mom and grandma want to pay you back the money your sister stole from you in exchange for you not pressing charges I think that would be a fair compromise. Your sister will not learn her lesson, but at least you will get your money back. \n\nWhy don\u2019t your mom and grandma care that you sister stole money from you, meant for your education?", "NTA.  You charge your sister but you should also charge the bank, because they did something illegal too.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed you could stop the charges at this point anyways. Other than lying to back up your sister, which would open a whole other can of worms as to why you called the university about it and could be a crime, it\u2019s not actually up to you whether the prosecutor prosecutes.", "NTA- and you may want to check that she hasn\u2019t opened credit cards or done anything else with your social security number either.", "I agree that you\u2019re NTA, but Reddit always answers in absolutes. You should also consider pressing charges will likely mean permanent NC with the rest of your family. If you\u2019re good with that, more power to you and fuck your sister (and mom). Good riddance. Forever.\n\nBut if you want to maintain a relationship with your mom, you might want to consider alternatives like creating a contract where she pays you back over time.", "Query - can your sister pay the money back? If yes and you want to keep family relations, then do that.\n\nIf no, I would press charges and report the bank. And do not let your family pay on her behalf and enable her. You probably won\u2019t be able to report the bank and try to get the grant clawed back unless you do", "NTA - She stole a nice chunk of money from you. Your parents' defense of her is probably part of the reason why she acts this way.\n\nDo her, your parents, and the world a favor: Hold her accountable for doing something that's obviously wrong.", "NTA\n\nBut you can\u2019t charge her with anything. So it\u2019s not up to you. Even if you don\u2019t do anything they have all of the evidence they used to arrest her.

Have either offered to pay back the money that sister stole, or are you just supposed to forget about that money because sisterly bonds are more important? \n\nI'm guessing this isn't the first time you've been sacrificed on the altar dedicated to your sister. \n\nIf I'm right then, honestly, it sounds like you would be better off with none of these people in your life. Either way though you should charge your sister and try to recuperate your money.", "NTA. Is there a plan for restitution? Will you get your money back?\n\nYour sister shouldn't have forged your signature and stolen $3500. She shouldn't have done that to her sibling.", "NTA.  Go after the bank too.  They definitely broke protocol, possibly federal laws by not following protocol.  May be able to get your money back there.", "do you have anyone in your personal life to talk to about this reddit is not the place to seek advice for this", "NTA but if there\u2019s a way to work things out and have it seen through as agreed, without using the justice system I think that might be preferable. If you go through with the charges you\u2019re going to have to accept that your relationships in your family are going to be forever changed. That shouldn\u2019t be on you since you\u2019re not the one who hurt anyone, but that\u2019s the reality of things. \n\nIdk if she\u2019d go to jail/prison or not for this, but prison can really fuck people up. Like yes, she should know that if she steals she could go to prison, and that\u2019s entirely on her. But it is a reality to be aware of going forward.

A hard head makes a soft ass. \n\nNAH, not you or your mom.  Just your sister.", "YTA. \n\nYou did the right thing reporting her and getting her arrested. Furthermore, she should be sorry and ready to pay as much as she can back (hopefully all of it).\n\nBut sending her to prison after a sentence for $3,500???  Your family will hate you, you won't get back your money and you might have to spend additional legal fees.\n\nI think it is better you negotiate a deal with her.", "I would go after the bank. You don\u2019t choose your siblings, I believe she had enough scare already to learn out of this situation.", "If $3500 is worth ruining your family dynamics, go for it. Look at all a felony does to someone, like voting, loans, employment, etc... I don't know about your family, but any sensible family I know wouldn't charge each other with felonies unless it was absolutely needed. I'd find other ways to collect my money through her than ruining her life. I get she did fraud, but they are still your family. Technically, you're NTA, but I could never ruin my siblings' lives over $3500. I think her being arrested, with her mugshot forever online, is enough.

Get outta here with all the \"You shouldn't do that to family!\" everyone always hears from the rest of the family when this kind of crap happens.

Exactly the kind of shit that causes all these situations to begin with.\n\nMake no mistake, that kind of familial bond doesn't mean shit to the people who are committing these acts against their own damned family.  Because they wouldn't do it, if it did.  So no, in my view they're going to learn the hard way if it ever happens to me.  Fuck around and find out at their own peril.  It's either that, or else I'm going to be the one going to prison after what I do to them in retaliation.  That's sarcasm, by the way lol.  Meant to highlight that the best option is to throw them to the damned law and file police reports and get that whole ball rolling.  Don't enable these kinds of people to keep pulling their shit on their own family, and don't let the rest of your family guilt you into enabling them with the rest of them.  Put your foot down.  I mean, it sounds like OP's sister is doing this to the rest of the family too, which isn't uncommon.  I have an aunt just like this.  She'd sell any one of us out for a few bucks.  She's been caught digging into people's things and writing down bank account numbers, social security numbers, the works.  We haven't had much contact with her since my Jr. High and High School days, and I'm 40 today.  So it's been a while.  I can only imagine the kind of damage she could do with that kind of info of everyone's in today's time with all the online stuff now.  I think for a while the family was split about her.  Some of us were fed up with her shit and cut her out.  The rest thought we were being so cruel because \"You don't do that to family!\"  Though to be fair, I was still at the end of high school and then my early 20s when all this happened so I was pretty young and didn't have much in the way of her to take advantage of, so I feel more like a witness to the whole thing than a participant of this rift regarding her.  But I saw this dynamic go down in real-time in my own family and learned from the experience secondhand, thank god.  \n\nBut what I can tell you now, is that eventually everyone finally came around to that line of thinking.  Tough love is cutting someone out for their own good, and for the rest of your family's.  And that's what you have to do with these types in your family or else they will keep on causing damage.  As more and more people just cut her out of her lives, she had less and less people around to take advantage of, steal from, or otherwise fuck over.  And when she circled around to their turn, and started pulling that shit on them repeatedly as well, you can bet they had a change of heart after that.  So now, she doesn't really have any of us in her life.  But the way I see it, she drove us out.  Not the other way around.\n\nTLDR; NTA and \"tough love\" is the way to deal with these people.  File the police report, seek legal action, and cut this person out for your own good.  It might take 10-20 years, but the rest of the family will eventually come around to this way of thinking as well when they eventually have their turn at being fucked over by this person.", "NTA she will never learn unless she pays the price for it.

Quit defending them.", "I am not exactly sure what people without an ID do in my country, but since we don't use cheques at all, I guess they revert to cash. \nCheques aren't a legal payment option here anymore since 1 Jan 2021.

Why are checks still that much in use in the US? Why don't they use more modern systems to transfer money?", "Bank of America once allowed you to access anyone's account if you were logged into any account by simply changing the account ID in the URL because they only checked if you were logged in not that you were logged into the correct account. That lasted for about a decade.", "It really is.\n\nCanadian Boomers might fit with them,though.\n\n\"American\" Boomerism is different, because the US and Canada were two countries that had a baby boom after the war, but also weren't leveled by WW2, and maintained their industry.\n\nSo, our Boomers grew up during an economic boom time, skewing their world view.", "Yeah that was pretty much my reaction at the time too. It was in a pretty rural area in Champagne, so I left my wife as collateral and drove into town to find an ATM.\n\nCoincidentally I was living in NL at the time; I didn\u2019t know that about cheques.

Better yet, what was VERY hard about it?", "Yes the sister, not the name who the check was written too. The bank should not have cashed it without the signature of the payee on there. Because of that it would be considered stolen property.  And in most jurisdictions the amount of the check would probably make it a felony.", "Take for instance someone had a house fire. Lost everything. Every piece of paperwork. Including birth certificate, social security card. Some people don't have even have an address anymore. Something you MUST have to get an id. Ever try to replace a birth certificate or social without a piece of paper saying who u r or where u live? Without those, you cannot get an id. U have to have proof of who u r to get proof of who u r.

His sister will NEVER change. If someone can steal from their own family there's no limit to what they can do. Also since she has your social security number OP should immediately put a fraud alert on his credit and check his credit  report to make sure she hasn't opened any accounts in his name!\nHard to swallow she stole 6k from OP's grandmother. Money the poor grandmother will NEVER get back. \nYes OP should definitely file a police report.\nNTA", "At this point, the sister has stolen $3,500 from OP, and thousands from her own grandma. She has shown she is willing to commit identity theft and steal from her own family.\n\nThe mom and grandma need to get their head out of their bums. The sister sounds like she is down a nasty path.

I totally get that it's easier for us to say as a third party, but dude, your dad said \"Fuck my son, I want money\" you don't need to protect him, he tossed you right under the bus.", "And mail fraud is a FEDERAL crime -- that's the one that'll really get her in trouble.", "Guess I\u2019ll just stand back in awe of the American penal system.  Most effective in the world.", "I can't get a bank account and I have no idea why. They say the credit bureaus blocked it... Which fuck them for many reasons, but I digress.

Unbelievable", ">\tSimply opening mail that is addressed to someone else without their consent is considered a felony all by itself\n\nA previous roommate started opening my mail and I actually called the cops over this and found out that this is not true. You have to be able to prove that they had malicious intent in regards to opening the mail.

I did a mobile deposit of a check with my name and my father's name on it. The bank rejected it because his name was not on the account.", "Eh, not the person you asked but it depends.\n\nWhen I changed my first name it was a pain in the ass to get mail (especially parcels) that would end up at the post office.

With my first bank account I got a check book, but I never used it. I was 12 and didn't even have an autograph at the time, and checks were a relic from the past only used by a few ancient people.

I had the same job for 10 years, and have banked with the same bank, same account etc. for 26 years. My boss for some reason refused to do direct deposit, so every two weeks I'd bring a cheque into the teller to put it into my account. Even with MY card, MY name on the cheque, and trying to put it into MY account (not even cash it!), if the cheque was over $500 they held it! But other people can go and CASH thousands of dollars in other people's names?!

And a bit more money to get the documents you need to prove your identity. You'll also need bus fare to get there. And they're only open during business hours, so you'll have to take time off work.", "There are a lot more protections and failsafes on cheques than electronic payments. There are a lot more things that are (supposed) to be verified, so if they *aren't* verified (like in the OP) it's very, very easy to legally get your money back. Kind of like how someone makes a fraudulent charge on your credit card, it's really easy to get your money back, especially if you have a police report. \n\nEdit: anecdotally I work for a boutique accounting firm and we pay all our bills by cheque. If it's a particularly high value cheque, we use a courier or registered mail/FedEx/etc. Many people also pay their taxes to the government (through us) with cheques, because you can't use a credit card. it really varies per country.
