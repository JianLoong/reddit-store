Your sister shouldn\u2019t have stolen if she wasn\u2019t willing to go to jail for it.  You should have an option to file a case against the bank as well, btw - they almost certainly violated financial laws to cash that check for her.  You may be able to get them to replace the money because of that, which will doubtless be faster than getting restitution from your sister.", "NTA. Your sister is making herself go to jail. You deserve a fair start to life. You earned that grant. She needs to learn about consequences", "NTA this is literally what the legal system is built for.", "NTA.  You aren't making her go to prison. Her decision to commit a felony is why she deserves to go to prison", "NTA. Here's a concept for your sister: If you don't want to go to prison for felony theft... don't commit felony theft?", "NTA. Stupid games win stupid prizes. Your sister made a choice knowing full well what the possible consequences would be. Sounds like she meeds to learn a thing or 20 anyways.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely press charges. Your sister is a thief, and should be held accountable for it. \n\nYour mother and grandmother are right\u2026she will be in serious trouble. She ***should be*** in serious trouble. \n\nThere\u2019s a good way to avoid legal trouble and jail; don\u2019t commit crimes. If she gets off with no repercussions, she will just do it again.", "NTA. She committed a felony. Time to face the consequences of her criminal action!", "NTA. Your sister is TA, if she can steal from her own sibling what would she do to anyone else may the opportunity arise? She needs to learn about consequences, in the long term this could be a good thing for her.", "NTA although your family probably won't agree. How will she learn if she isn't being held accountable for her actions? I have to ask why she's doing this sort of thing though..? Is she using the money to support an addiction or is she just a selfish dick? If it's the former id give her a chance since addictions cause people to do things they normally wouldn't do. But if it's the latter and she's just a jerk then do what you gotta do. I was assaulted by an uncle and half my family stopped talking to me because I went to the police and had him arrested over it. \"You don't do that to family\" was their argument. My argument was that you don't assault your family... That was over 10 years ago and they still don't talk to me and I don't talk to them. But I have zero regrets. Good luck. I hope you get your money back.", "This isn't really an AITA question. The real victim is the grantor, and you probably have a legal obligation to assist them with the prosecution of the case. Reluctance on your part could be construed as complicity. The way you show this was not a scheme cooked up by you and Sister is by you cooperating fully with the prosecution of the case. Otherwise you could be on the hook for the money, or maybe even sitting in jail with Sister. Its a property crime and many jurisdictions dont have money to keep violent offenders in jail so she may not even go to prison.

NTA.", "So to them it's ok she forged your check and stole from you? I noticed they're not offering restitution either. She committed a crime against her sibling so loyalty means nothing to her.

Consequences of actions", "You would of course not be the AH", "NTA- do press charges. She stole your check that you needed for college. Don\u2019t listen to your mom and grandma for enabling this behavior by trying to get you not to keep the charges on her so she won\u2019t get in more trouble. This is a pretty serious crime here and it is messing with your education at the same time. She needs to learn the lesson and the only way that will happen is if she gets in trouble for it. She will keep doing this to you or even worse, use your social security number for other things. Call the social security office and find out if your number has been used for anything else and change your signature a little bit as well so this can\u2019t happen again. This is Fraud and your identity was stolen and who knows if she has used your identity elsewhere.", "NTA. Your sister made a choice knowing full well what the possible consequences would be.

When everyone asked if I would drop the charges, it was made clear the city is charging them, not me.  I couldn't drop the charge if I wanted to.  So, if they ask, tell them it's not your choice.", "NTA.   \nShe is getting exactly what she deserves.\n\nGo talk to the bank manager, and explain that  you expect them to reimburse you the full amount. If there is a banking ombudsman, talk to them as well", "NTA, I can\u2019t believe how many people get ripped off by family members", "NTA. Let's count the crimes here - Taking somebody else's mail  OPENING said mail without the recipient's knowledge or permission, theft of somebody else's money, FORGERY... She surely knew how much trouble she was going to get in every step of the way to get herself $3,500. Not only that, but she did it to her OWN SIBBLING who got that money to use for college. Does she think this was all worth it, ruining your trust in her, damaging your future, and ending up in a jail cell for at least two felony charges?", "The $ was stolen not only from OP but from the grant program that specified that OP, the student, was the recipient, not their thieving sister.\n\nPlease press charges.  It\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nAnd lock down your credit.  Your sister knows enough to commit fraud with your money.", "It's 3500 no NTA\nAnd the bank should not have allowed her to cash it", "I'll never understand the American obsession with checks. Are wire transfers so terrible there?", "NTA.  You'd be a total AH if you didn't press charges and beg the judge for the harshest sentence possible.", "NTA. I had the chance to charge my partner with grand larceny several years ago and chose not to. He was struggling with a drug problem and even though he stole from me, I wanted him to keep a clean record. Fast forward to today: He was murdered two years ago in a drug related situation. I wonder if going to jail would have made a positive difference to the outcome?  If I had it to do over, I would\u2019ve sent him to jail. Sheltering someone from the consequences of their actions is enabling. I was guilty of enabling him throughout our relationship. I knew about the term enabling, but thought it didn\u2019t apply in the way I was doing things. Yes, I absolutely should have attended meetings for friends and family of drug abusers. I was arrogant and thought I knew everything. I knew nothing. His parents and I enabled him right into an early grave. Consequences might have saved him.", "Are you charging her or did you start an inquiry that lead to the prosecutor pressing charges? She deserves to be punished, but  it maybe out of your hands, especially if a bank is involved.", "NTA\n\nYour sister stole from you and if you don\u2019t stand up for yourself no one will. Your family is clearly unwilling to help so the legal system is your best option", "NTA she decided to do the crime. I would look at them and say how sad that your sister threw her life away for some money. Sucks being held accountable.", "NTA. If your mom and grandma want to pay you back the money your sister stole from you in exchange for you not pressing charges I think that would be a fair compromise. Your sister will not learn her lesson, but at least you will get your money back. \n\nWhy don\u2019t your mom and grandma care that you sister stole money from you, meant for your education?", "NTA.  You charge your sister but you should also charge the bank, because they did something illegal too.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed you could stop the charges at this point anyways. Other than lying to back up your sister, which would open a whole other can of worms as to why you called the university about it and could be a crime, it\u2019s not actually up to you whether the prosecutor prosecutes.", "NTA- and you may want to check that she hasn\u2019t opened credit cards or done anything else with your social security number either.", "I agree that you\u2019re NTA, but Reddit always answers in absolutes. You should also consider pressing charges will likely mean permanent NC with the rest of your family. If you\u2019re good with that, more power to you and fuck your sister (and mom). Good riddance. Forever.\n\nBut if you want to maintain a relationship with your mom, you might want to consider alternatives like creating a contract where she pays you back over time.", "Query - can your sister pay the money back? If yes and you want to keep family relations, then do that.\n\nIf no, I would press charges and report the bank. And do not let your family pay on her behalf and enable her. You probably won\u2019t be able to report the bank and try to get the grant clawed back unless you do", "NTA - She stole a nice chunk of money from you. Your parents' defense of her is probably part of the reason why she acts this way.\n\nDo her, your parents, and the world a favor: Hold her accountable for doing something that's obviously wrong.", "NTA\n\nBut you can\u2019t charge her with anything. So it\u2019s not up to you. Even if you don\u2019t do anything they have all of the evidence they used to arrest her. It\u2019s not going to go away \n\nPlus the college will need that arrest/report on file to go after the bank to get their money back and give it to you.", "NTA.\n\n>now my mom and grandma are saying she will be in serious trouble if I dont drop the charges and that I shouldnt do that to my sister.\n\nWould I be right in my suspicions that your sister was enabled by mom and grandma growing up?  Have either offered to pay back the money that sister stole, or are you just supposed to forget about that money because sisterly bonds are more important? \n\nI'm guessing this isn't the first time you've been sacrificed on the altar dedicated to your sister. \n\nIf I'm right then, honestly, it sounds like you would be better off with none of these people in your life. Either way though you should charge your sister and try to recuperate your money.", "NTA. Is there a plan for restitution? Will you get your money back?\n\nYour sister shouldn't have forged your signature and stolen $3500. She shouldn't have done that to her sibling.", "NTA.  Go after the bank too.  They definitely broke protocol, possibly federal laws by not following protocol.  May be able to get your money back there.", "do you have anyone in your personal life to talk to about this reddit is not the place to seek advice for this", "NTA but if there\u2019s a way to work things out and have it seen through as agreed, without using the justice system I think that might be preferable. If you go through with the charges you\u2019re going to have to accept that your relationships in your family are going to be forever changed. That shouldn\u2019t be on you since you\u2019re not the one who hurt anyone, but that\u2019s the reality of things. \n\nIdk if she\u2019d go to jail/prison or not for this, but prison can really fuck people up. Like yes, she should know that if she steals she could go to prison, and that\u2019s entirely on her. But it is a reality to be aware of going forward. If it\u2019s a fine and probation and no jail time, I do think that changes things.", "I understand where your family is coming from but hell nah, if she needed the money she should have asked. A hard head makes a soft ass. \n\nNAH, not you or your mom.  Just your sister.", "YTA. \n\nYou did the right thing reporting her and getting her arrested. Furthermore, she should be sorry and ready to pay as much as she can back (hopefully all of it).\n\nBut sending her to prison after a sentence for $3,500???  Your family will hate you, you won't get back your money and you might have to spend additional legal fees.\n\nI think it is better you negotiate a deal with her.", "I would go after the bank. You don\u2019t choose your siblings, I believe she had enough scare already to learn out of this situation.", "If $3500 is worth ruining your family dynamics, go for it. Look at all a felony does to someone, like voting, loans, employment, etc... I don't know about your family, but any sensible family I know wouldn't charge each other with felonies unless it was absolutely needed. I'd find other ways to collect my money through her than ruining her life. I get she did fraud, but they are still your family. Technically, you're NTA, but I could never ruin my siblings' lives over $3500. I think her being arrested, with her mugshot forever online, is enough.

The bank would probably prefer to pin it all on the sister rather than having to deal with the consequences of not carrying out their fiduciary duties towards OP.\n\nDropping charges is ultimately the call of the party pressing the charges and that, in a criminal case, is the prosecutor.
