So the guy chasing us through the haunted house with a chainsaw wasn't scary.  To me.  My girlfriend was scared from the disorientation and the noise and the best really amazing costume.  But I played along. I let the actors chase us, I hid with her in a closet where the back falls away and there is a Japanese ghost girl in it. It was fun and my girlfriend was happy.

I won't spoil it but I can understand why it would scare people.  \n\nSo we got out and we went to see the pictures and there we are a group of six people with five cowering in fear and me looking slightly interested at the way they pulled off the effect.  \n\nI told my girlfriend I was so scared I froze.  \n\nSo anyway we go have a few drinks and some food at a pub down the way.

I apologized for my silly prank. But he looked pissed and the other actors got that I was joking and laughed.  I didn't touch him or anything. That would have been rude.  \n\nMy girlfriend said I was an asshole for scaring him on his break.  I feel kind of bad about it but you would think a guy who does that for work would have a better sense of humor about being scared.\n\nEdit already damn it. \n\nI gave him $20 for more beer.

Though way lessened by the kind purchase of beer.  As others have mentioned, he wasn't there because he loved being in haunted houses, but just to collect a paycheck. And honestly, what if he had knocked himself over and broken some bones or something? Not worth the drama that could've followed.", "YTA. He didn't pay money to go into a haunted alley. And just because he works in a haunted house doesn't mean he loves his job or the things about it. Sometimes a job is just a job.", "YTA\n\nYou just don't bother workers during their break. It's the only moment of the workday you have to think/talk about something else but work.", "YTA-Apologies are good. Giving him money for the spilled beer was great but the prank was assholish in the first place. It doesn\u2019t matter that he works there or that you think he should have a better sense of humor. The prank made you a minor asshole.", "Working at a haunted house isn\u2019t a career, it\u2019s a temp job that (based on people I know who have experience) is crappy to do. He\u2019s most likely not there because he\u2019s so damn passionate about the position. \n\nIt\u2019s nice you gave him money for more beer, but you\u2019re still YTA for trying to minimize this rather than be mature and acknowledge this was a dick move.", "Dude I just busted my ass for free at my friends haunted house all month. These people are there to put on a show for your entertainment. It's exhausting. I don't even know why you brought up not being scared the whole time. Edit YTA big time", "YTA. You don't know that guy. He wasn't a friend. He wasn't anything to you. What you did was rude and you should be glad he didn't fall over and get hurt.", "It was a dick move but not that big a deal, no real harm done. \n\nHowever, I don't see the relevance of your extended background about how not scared you were, it's entirely not connected to you jump-scaring some poor dude just trying to chill from his job. \n\nIt kinda seems like you just like telling people how much 'scary' stuff doesn't scare you.", "NAH.\n\nIt was uncool to scare him. Just because he works in a haunted house doesn\u2019t make it ok. But the beer makes up for it.", "NTA\n\nThese are actors who want to work there, they aren't forced to do it. Heck I have seen documentaries on these things where the actors help keep the place running and decorate it. It is there passion. They love horror and scaring people. What you did was a simple joke,  you didn't cross any lines and no one was hurt, except his ego. You apologized and gave him well over the price for another beer. Please don't lose any sleep over this.", "Oh NTA on so many levels hell you even purchased a round for him at worst, so much NTA and a good guy to boot.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
