My wife needed to take our son to an appt nd I needed to WFH today so my MIL came to watch after our daughter.\n\nMy daughter needed to use the bathroom, and I was going to excuse myself from my online meeting but my MIL said she had it. A bit later, my daughter came up to me and asked me to wipe her. I said to her, didn't Grandma help you? (She knows how to wipe, but with her having diarrhea we're helping her). She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)\n\nI excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers. And that there's no chance of any infection because their vagina doesn't actually develop until they're a teenager. I was... dumbfounded. And I got angry.\n\nI said to her, \"You're a woman, you raised three daughters, I'm married to one... you can't possibly be this stupid?\" \n\nShe told me I'm out of line and said if I can't appreciate her help then she's leaving. I told her I'm perfectly, in fact definitely more capable than her of caring for my daughter, and that she's welcome to get out. She did leave, and about ten minutes layer my wife called me and said her mom was furious with me and said I was terrible to her and made her leave without any reason.

I highly doubt this person was an RN of any kind. At least, I really hope they aren't.", "Not a big deal for us. I've never had an I ssue. Btw, I don't wipe past my taint. I will do that backwards after. So, poop never makes it to my scrotum, let alone my urethra.", "Right!  Not only that she knew this wasn't right and that she wasn't really clean, but that she knew she could go to her Dad about this since her Mom was out of the house.", "Sometimes, people just start spouting bs when caught in a mistake. Would rather just make stuff up than admit they\u2019re wrong.", "Just fyi, it doesn't make sense to call a fetus \"assigned female at birth\" when it hasn't been born yet. It's just female.", "I'm just dumbfounded about this, it's like saying you don't know what your nose does...it's a part of your body, very hard to miss.", "Some people do it intentionally", "That phrase used to be \u201cthe way to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach.\u201d\n\nThat is just a metaphor that means if you cook your man delicious food, you will make him happy, etc.", "This is very important indeed,  we recently had a court case in Sweden and an \"alledged\" pedophile is now free to roam about because the girl used the word \"snippa\" which is the Swedish word for hoo-haa...", "I just had that talk last week with a set of parents. I work with kids and in looking at starting school, I went ahead and talked to that girl client's parents about using the actual terminology and teaching kiddo that no one should be touching/looking at their vagina or breasts except in situations like going to the doctor because they have an infection or an injury. Mom told me they had been calling breasts \"okra\" and my first thought was that, god forbid, someone were to be touching her breasts no one would know what was happening because she said someone touched her \"okra\".", "Dries out the skin too.", "My parents had to stop sitz baths for me  as a toddler for that reason. I had what the doctor thought was diaper rash and my parents were told to put me in camomile sitz baths - which my parents already did and only made it worse. Wasn't a diaper rash but a yeast infection.", "She just shoved it into the vaginal canal hard enough it rips through and pops into the bladder. Easy", "Into the catheter hole, of course. :)", "I\u2019m guessing that Grandma believes that vaginas *poof* into existence once a penis dreams it up.", "I just commented above about my Hispanic gfs at school not being educated on periods and agreeing it\u2019s cultural. When I read your comment it reminded me they also forever wore pads because they were taught this!", "\"Vagina\" was pretty much used as a catch all term for the whole area when I was growing up and the word vulva always felt *incredibly* weird for me to say. When I had a daughter, I forced myself to use vulva and now she *won't* find it incredibly weird to say. Both of my kids know the proper names for genitals and while it can get a little embarrassing when they start to talk about them, it's still better for them to know.", "That sounds a lot less painful than the tattoo. I'm rethinking my earlier statement", "My mom was afraid to let me use tampons in the 7th grade because it would cause me to \u201close my virginity.\u201d I went to Catholic School during these years, as well, and while they didn\u2019t teach us about tampons in school, I know it was the Catholic upbringing that made her believe this nonsense.", "Seconding this. My best friend in high school (graduated in 2005) had some very, very wrong ideas about how sex and baby making worked, because her mom taught her incorrectly, because her mom taught *her* incorrectly, and so on. My bestie ended up having a loooong talk with my mom (an OBGYN) a few months before she got married to get her info straightened out. We have perfectly adequate sex ed in schools here, and she went to public school. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Honestly that's amazing of you. I just don't get or understand people who never question why their bodies do the things they do. Like when I was younger I was terrified of eating watermelon seeds because my sisters told me that's how babies were made. I can't believe any version of me in any universe still believing that at my age. And I did believe it for a good couple years until I connected the dots between sex and pregnancy.", "Ok lil scientist! That\u2019s adorable", "My poor dad was molested by a priest when he was a kid, and when he told his parents, he was told to shut up and be a good Christian. He did the right thing by raising me non-religious, I'd say.", "Fellow millennial, I was also not informed of correctly wiping either.", "I think it's probably more flexibility, I'm a chunky gal but can still do one swipe front to back, but only with the right hand, if I hurt my right hand or arm I can't do the one swipe with my left hand so I have to figure out an alternative method and it always feels weird.", "The problem is p*rn.
