A bit later, my daughter came up to me and asked me to wipe her. I said to her, didn't Grandma help you? (She knows how to wipe, but with her having diarrhea we're helping her). She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)\n\nI excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers. And that there's no chance of any infection because their vagina doesn't actually develop until they're a teenager. I was... dumbfounded. And I got angry.\n\nI said to her, \"You're a woman, you raised three daughters, I'm married to one... you can't possibly be this stupid?\" \n\nShe told me I'm out of line and said if I can't appreciate her help then she's leaving. I told her I'm perfectly, in fact definitely more capable than her of caring for my daughter, and that she's welcome to get out.

Our sex ed program was abstinence only because a religious group in our area had VERY vocal parents, and even then some of them still pulled their kids out of the health classes because they considered it immoral to learn about reproductive anatomy. Stunningly, the girls in these families tend to get married before turning 20 and proceed to have babies until menopause hits.

My school didn\u2019t do sex ed and my parents didn\u2019t teach me anything about my body. When I got my period I was told that it was just something that happens to women every month, that I had to hide it because it was disgusting, and that if I used tampons I wouldn\u2019t be a virgin anymore. Nothing about why, or the mechanics of what was going on inside my body, or even what virgin meant. Just, it happens, don\u2019t let anyone know because it\u2019s very shameful. I had no idea it even came as a cycle that I could have tracked, and never knew my period was going to start until it happened. When I asked any questions related to sex or my vagina, I was told I wouldn\u2019t need to know things like that till I was married.\n\n\nI had to learn everything myself from the internet.

I had to shame the teacher by telling her she was wrong and the changes had already happened because puberty doesn\u2019t hit at a magic age, and I needed to go change my bad before I left a puddle of blood on my chair.  \n\nThe teacher tried to get me into trouble for lying and embarrassing her but the school nurse looked at her in the eye in the meeting and said an 11 year old absolutely can have a period, and then my grandmother offered to bring in the basket of used pads since obviously she was in menopause and was the only person I lived with.
