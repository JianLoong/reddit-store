A bit later, my daughter came up to me and asked me to wipe her. I said to her, didn't Grandma help you? (She knows how to wipe, but with her having diarrhea we're helping her). She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)\n\nI excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers. And that there's no chance of any infection because their vagina doesn't actually develop until they're a teenager. I was... dumbfounded. And I got angry.\n\nI said to her, \"You're a woman, you raised three daughters, I'm married to one... you can't possibly be this stupid?\" \n\nShe told me I'm out of line and said if I can't appreciate her help then she's leaving. I told her I'm perfectly, in fact definitely more capable than her of caring for my daughter, and that she's welcome to get out.

A lot of us want meaningful change and aren\u2019t able to get it because of the political landscape. So yeah it sucks to be insulted over things we can\u2019t change, especially when the people doing the insulting think it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s getting old fast. It might be funny to you, but we actually have to fuckin live here.", "Yep! I\u2019m dumbfounded that the MIL has gotten to her age thinking otherwise.", "The youngest girl to give birth was *five*, and there's a ton of stories about other young girls out there, all of which seem to involve sexual abuse, and many by family members.", "I smell stroke I think I\u2019m having a toast", "Thank you, as English is my forth language i may make some mistakes.\n\nAs i am never been in Norway, i still think its a amazing country.\n\nGreetings from the couch in the living room at home in Switzerland.", "[it\u2019s always the Iranian yogurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bjd41e/aita_for_throwing_away_my_boyfriends_potentially/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)", "BV in a child this age would be hugely unusual.

We are old and remember pre-internet life but the 80s weren\u2019t that long ago. She was either raised without an education or she was raised prior to the 80s. More likely she was born in the early 1950s.", "Good for your mom to have been taught that I guess ?  The MIL wasn't. We cannot debate \"do people know that\". Some did. Some don't. Clearly, MIL wasn't aware.  Yelling at her won't change that fact.", "Nope. Never say anything while angry. OP was the one who freaked out against a woman who loves her grandchild and deserved more respect than that. He could have just said that's the rule of the house and see if she complied. Instead he chose the drama.", "For sure she wasn\u2019t interested in a lesson because OP called her stupid. If he had paused and been like \u201care you serious?\u201d And she goes \u201cyeah duh i have a vagina so of course I know what\u2019s up\u201d then OP could have said \u201cactually, times have changed since your sex ed class (or lack of) and science has shown that vaginas are indeed real and susceptible to infection at any age.

But by all means go off...", "Mhm, who expects family aye? Its horrible, disgusting and just truly heartbreaking. Thier bodies and minds cant handle it.

I hope not for her sake though.", "I'm just saying. At some point in our lives ignorance stops being a valid excuse for dumbfuckery. Yes, yelling isn't the best way to go about it, and I'm not even upset about the wiping part tbh, but to not make the connection that a little girl's genitals is not biologically the same as her future adult genitals (minus hair and periods) is bizarre. If I was a 4 yo hearing this (which I'm sure the daughter was sheilded from hearing about.l, hopefully) I would live in fear for the day when my vagina (or vulva or any part of me) falls off and I get a new one.", "I was taught that it's best to stab upwards, because then you don't have to worry about the ribcage getting in the way.

Sorry it\u2019s my brain not firing on all cylinders.", "The vaginal opening in a 4 year old is really tiny. Which I'm guessing is what MIL means by not really being there yet (I suspect she's basing it on what she can see of her daughters/nieces etc in comparison to what she knows adults will look like and not any real biological knowledge that beyond that tiny opening everything is already there and fully formed beyond it) and she isn't completely wrong in that infections of the actual vagina at that age are incredibly rare (it *can* get infected, but if you went to a doctor with a 4 year old whose actual vaginal canal was infected it would likely raise flags for the doctor for abuse as it's so unusual, unless there was other underlying infection in the area/obvious cause) She would be incredibly unlucky for that to happen even with diarrhea and if dad went to wipe after it will most likely be fine. \n\nWiping wrong does commonly cause UTI and vulvovaginitis/skin irritation and infection of the labia and vulva though so MIL should be wiping front to back always. \n\nI'm also not a doctor but sadly have a lot of experience with this area of medicine/biology.", "And I really wonder how she was supposed to know that she needed new information. She thought she was correct. Nothing gave her a reason to rethink her beliefs until this moment.\n\nYou currently probably have tons of subjects that are wrong on (and I do too!), but you don't know it. Are you going to wake up a morning and all of a sudden, remember a topic you know about, and go on to google to make sure your knowledge is correct ? Like, you know you have 2 kidneys, will you wake up one morning and go to Google \"How many kidneys do I have?\" to make sure. Probably not. You know it. So you take it for granted."]}
