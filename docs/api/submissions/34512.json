Seeking a family therapist could help navigate this change and mitigate further trauma. While it's a challenging time, strive for open communication and consider professional guidance to find the best path forward for everyone involved. It's key to focus on solutions that are in the best interests of the child above all.\n\nWhen custody arrangements change suddenly, it can indeed be stressful and traumatic for the child involved. Your concerns about inflicting further trauma on your niece are valid and compassionate.\n\nSeeking help from a professional such as a counselor or an unbiased family therapist is a sensible approach. A therapist can provide a safe space for all parties to express their feelings and work toward a resolution that considers the best interests of the child.\n\nFamily dynamics can be complex and challenging to navigate, especially when adding or blending in new members.

You prevent them to getting closer, too, because you act like it's his fault by punishing him.\n\nSomeone should make your niece clear,  explain it carefully that her father did and new wife did her wrong not her stepbrother. \n\nIf you really want to help your niece talk with her dad and tell him what he's doing to his poor child and how he damages every possibility for her to bond with his new family if he excludes her.\n\nYou are not better than your brother.
