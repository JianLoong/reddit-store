Your brother is a major AH for basically abandoning his daughter for his wife and stepson. I can only imagine how it makes his daughter feel.  Also his wife is a huge AH for either pushing for the reduced custody, or sitting by while he neglects his daughter to take care of her son. I could never allow someone around my kids who doesn't take care of their own. The wife also can't be too surprised that this is going on. What your family did is a human response to seeing a loved one being hurt so badly, but in the end, it still won't negate the feelings of abandonment she must have from her father. Also in the future, other people in her life may not cater to the insecurities the abandonment may cause, so it would be best if you all speak to her mother about getting her into therapy so she understands that what her father did has nothing to do with her, but everything to do with him and his weak nature.", "Your brother is the biggest AH here.
