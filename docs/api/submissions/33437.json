They want to buy a used RV and not take it back to their place. What happens if something gets in there while it's on your property? You don't actually have a storage spot available.

Some places store RVs, boats, etc. for winter.", "NTA; send cousin eddie to a local storage place where you can rent a space to store the RV.", "NTA. Those are all fine reasons for you to not want it parked there. Tell them exactly that so they can look for other arrangements before they purchase it.", "NTA\n\nI let my SIL put his RV next to my house for 3 years and that spot of my lawn is completely dead, hard packed dirt. Even weeds are having a problem taking root. I'm going to have to rent an aerator and grass seed to try to fix it.", "NTA. You have no suitable parking for it. Just say so.", "NTA - I guess there\u2019s no real harm in them asking, though. It\u2019s your property and you don\u2019t really even need a reason to say no, but all of your reasons why this is a terrible idea are perfectly valid ones.", "NTA, there are self storage places. It doesn't cost too much either and it's insured and has security", "There may be zoning regulations which limit or prohibit parking large vehicles on a residential lot. There are in my village so check you village code  tree", "Ah the joys of owning land. Let them stick it out in the back pasture. Tell em the cow and mouse damage isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA. That is an incredible assumption from the in- laws", "NAH.   They aren't assholes for asking.  You aren't an asshole for saying no.", "NTA. They need to find a rental spot.", "NTA. I have relatives that agreed, reluctantly, to store their inlaws boat (35' cruiser) on their property over the winter because they didnt want to haul it back or pay for storage. Over the winter a major storm went through, high winds and took out a tree which landed on the boat and wrote it off. When it came to insurance the inlaws and their insurance company went after my relatives and their insurance. And won. Relatives insurance had to pay out then dropped them as a client (house, cottage and multiple vehicles) and now their new insurance costs them almost double as a result.", "I'd search for a storage lot where they can store their RV and point them to that. They are very common for this exact reason. In addition, speaking from someone who just recently got out of the insurance business, most RVs that are parked and not in continual use, like in a yard, very quickly get rodents. Lots of rodents in nests close to uour house make you all the more likely to get them yourself. It really is a lot for them to ask.", "Say no.\n\nExplain the reasons.", "# NTA", "nta", "[deleted]", "You can't figure out a way to help your in-laws for a few months?

You have taken pains to list your reasons, but I wouldn't begin to share those with anyone unless you're up for a long point-by-point argument you won't win.

At least you're honest.", "NTA. They can pay to park it at a storage place.  If they can afford an RV they should be able to pay for its maintenance. This is something both you and your husband should agree on as it affects the whole family. He needs to tell them no.  Also look into your local laws. Can you even store one on your property for extended periods of time?", "NTA.  I just wouldn't want to look at that big ole ugly RV every day for months.  Nope.", "Nta, all are valid reasons. Search for a storage area they can rent in the area. I pay $35\\month for mine. Heck, if you wanna be extra nice confirm a space available, set it up and pay for it. Will win you a lot of points.", "NTA.  Nobody would want this.  Not even short term.  All of your reasons are valid.  I would present them to the inlaws.  And let them know this is a liability you're not willing to take on.  If they can't take it home with them, then they shouldn't buy it.  Or buy it & put it in storage until they can get it.  But they should not be putting the responsibility on you.", "NTA. They have to understand that the RV comes with expenses, such as renting a storage spot for it if they don't want to keep it at their place.\n\nIf they can't afford to store the RV, then they can't afford the RV.", "I didn't even think about the rodents getting into the RV.  My property is adjacent to forested land, a hay field, and a neighbor with more junk piles/ broken-down cars than you can imagine.  I have shop cats to keep mice and rats out of my shop and firewood storage.", "Say no.\n\nDon't explain the reasons.", "No, it makes a circle in front of the house with a raised area in the middle with trees.  Picture a big \"6\" with the house at the base of the six and the road at the top.  The shop access is by a small compacted dirt road along side of house to the shop behind the house.", "\"I don't want your rv taking up my driveway\" is a solution", "My driveway is about 12 inches of baserock and road mix that still gets muddy in spots that I fix every year due to high clay soils and a natural wetland. Pavers would just sink into the mud too. My driveway is only a single lane. I told my wife to suggest the RV storage down th road and we can even drive by to keep an eye on it but she says no we will just deal with it here...", "I\u2019d say no period. It\u2019s a liability for you if you\u2019re in the us (not sure about other countries). I\u2019ve seen it firsthand. Something happens (weather event, burglary etc) and in order for them to get repairs their insurance will sue yours and win. You\u2019ll be dropped and have to pay thousands to get reinsured. Do not do it. They can pay $100/$200 a month to park it nearer to their house. I will never store anything for anyone at any time because of what I\u2019ve seen. Just say no it\u2019s not possible, find other plans because my house isn\u2019t available.", "Also this", "She doesn\u2019t get to make that decision alone."]}
