It's much more complicated than parking a car.  Have they run the numbers of cost of ownership v. cost of rental for the time they'd actually be using it?  Cost of fuel?  If the current Israel/Gaza conflict and Houthi assaults on ships spiral into a regional war, if the next pandemic is something else we oh so clever humans can't handle well, or all sorts of other contingencies, then oil prices will rise -- so they should run the numbers for twice and triple the cost of fuel, oil, etc.  If they're making the argument that buying off season will save them money, then they're not accounting for cost of storage and/or likely damage over the winter.
