{"id": 32442, "submission_id": "18c1gl7", "title": "AITA for telling my brother that his son is not a monster for not being his wife's emotional support human?", "selftext": "My nephew Greyson is 15 years old. When he was 8 his mom and unborn sister passed away after she had a placental abruption. Grey was in the car with his parents at the time it happened and he watched his mom die. My brother Ken also watched his wife die. It was incredibly traumatic for both of them. Ken fell apart and so did Grey but Ken focused more on his own grief and healing than he did on Grey's and ignored Grey's grief further when he decided 18 months later that he was ready to date again. Ken met his second wife Vera when Grey was 10 and they got married 5 months into their relationship.\n\nVera told Grey that she would do everything she could to be a good mom to him and fill the shoes his mom left better than anyone could. She \"joked\" more than once that she might even be better than his \"old mom\". That, along with Grey feeling like Ken was replacing his mom, and doing everything too fast, meant Grey never liked or bonded with Vera. She has tried very hard to get close to him but he's not interested.\n\nI tried talking to Ken about getting Grey help and talking to a therapist himself. My parents always assure Ken Grey will come around in time.\n\nA little over a year ago Ken and Vera's son was stillborn due to a fatal fetal abnormality that ran in Vera's family, which she was not aware of. She ended up needing a c-section because of complications and afterward she was no longer able to have more children. \n\nGrey did not have much of a reaction to the loss. He was open with me that he really didn't feel any grief despite everyone expecting him to. To him he lost no sibling when his half brother was stillborn. He was never excited for him or considered him anything more than his dad's baby with someone. But everyone has expected it and even our parents told Ken that Grey would fall apart in time. During all this Vera has wanted Grey to be there for her and comfort her and be the son he has never wanted to be to her.\n\nRecently Vera made a greater effort to try and get Grey to be there and comfort her. She confronted him and told him she needed him to be more caring. This happened in front of my parents and my family. She told him she feels like he doesn't care. That he can't even support his family. He told her she is not his family and he won't ever be there to support her. Ken jumped in and said it's like he doesn't care and that's sick. He then went on a rant about how Grey should be so much more concerned and loving toward Vera and he called him a monster for refusing to be there for her after the worst loss of her life. \n\nI told Ken that he shouldn't talk to Grey that way. I told him Grey is not a monster for refusing to be Vera's emotional support human and that he expected way too much given the very sour and complicated relationship that was there already.\n\nMy parents and Ken thought I was horrifically wrong for stepping in. Grey thanked me and he told me Ken doesn't get that he views him as a cold monster and that he's ashamed of him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701860074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c1gl7/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_his_son_is_not_a/", "score": 5521, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Men go through grieve in different ways. But most don\u2019t cope well with loneliness when they loose a spouse. I have seen it happen a lot. So they jump into a new marriage quite quickly.

He needs someone in his corner, be that person for him.\n\n Right now, it's like no one sees him as a real person, and they all expect him to finally fulfill the role they envisioned for him, which will simply never happen. Their only options are to either work on building a real relationship with the real person he is and accept the dynamics of it (dad's wife will never be a new mom to Grey, but they probably can have a loving and caring relationship), or continue to push him to play this role of a happy son, which will probably lead to him wanting to quit this show altogether. He will be an adult soon and will be able to enforce the boundaries he wants, which might as well be low contact with them.\n\nTry again talking to your brother, Grey should be in therapy, and they should do family therapy as well (father and son first only I think).

Everyone deals with grief and trauma in different ways and as a child he needs time, understanding, love, and should be seeing a professional due to the fact that he not only lost his mom and sibling but watched it!! When I was his age I had many traumatizing experiences (some I blocked out) and I never got help until my late 20's and I'm 39. It seems like you're his support system and he can talk to you. Have you tried to speak to Ken alone in a calm environment and explain what you witnessed?

Everyone grieves in different ways but to ignore your son that was a child and literally went through the same insanely traumatic situation you did, then to marry a women after 5 months, then let her speak that way to your son about your late wife! Unacceptable!!!!! Period. And just as everyone has stated, a child is NOT the parent\u2019s emotional support. Parents need to be there to help support the child. Because the parents need to be the adults in the situation. Yes, grieve your loss too, but help your child grieve through it as well. Grey does need some therapy but most importantly the step-mom and father. Again, so glad Grey has your support. Also I agree about looking at the local laws if you decide to let Grey stay, short or long term, with you. You don\u2019t want to make the situation worse for him.

He has not had time to properly mourn and at 8, he didn't understand how. I will never judge how someone grieves and Ken has every right to move on.

His new wife is trying to be his replacement mom and she has pushed him to the point that he wants nothing to do with her. I feel for her having a stillborn child. That is a horrific thing to happen to her and I hope she gets therapy.

It's a massive shame no one if the family besides you can see where he is coming from. Yeah dude lost his wife, yeah and replaced her, but you can never really replace your birth mother that died right in front of you. He needs years of therapy and love and understanding from his father, and dear God I would love to have a sit down with your family. You can replace the one who holds you at night and comforts you and has sex with you. But you will never be able to replace a parent you didn't fully have help grieving over,  and didn't have help from your own father to grieving over and to have him replace her and to have her joke about replacing her would ruin that relationship 100%. She shouldn't even try to replace,  she should be there to love and help support and raise. Replacing should have never came up, period. Your entire family are the ass holes to the millions of degrees, they are neglecting his feelings and making him feel wrong for having them. Which is making him worse and making him colder towards them. Dear God I don't like step parents like this. And you DO NOT force a child to be your therapist or to be there you emotionally,  that is what your partner is for, and that is what a therapist is for, hell, get an emotional support animal, but don't force this on a child whose mother you are trying to erase. Which is what she is trying to do. I feel bad about the still birth, but fuck her in this situation, and the dad. Maybe it's a sign that they don't need to be parents. I feel they would neglect the son if they ever had one of their own, it happened to me. That's what happens.

He was a child and you for all intents abandoned him. And you rushed right into finding a new wife. Your new wife showed an  unbelievable lack of sensitivity and empathy but assuming that he would immediately accept her as his mother. Her comments about Gary's mother are horrible. You have failed your son as a father and your wife has made things even worse.  \n\nThe fact that they don't  have a clue about how badly they have messed up with Gary just boggles the mind. They took a really bad situation and made it so far worse and then try to put the blame on Gary for an outcome they don't like. \n\nConsider talking to a really good family law attorney to see if there is anything that you could do to help him. Can his Dad be forced to allow Gary to attend counseling. The report of a therapist may show that his current home is not healthy for him. Is there a chance that you could fight for court ordered visitation to make sure that Gary has some regular time away from his Dad and has a sense of hope that there is an end in sight to time spent with his Dad.

I will never understand people who have children but don't seem to realize these are HUMANS and have their own emotions and rather than take the time to comfort his son he just 'got him a new mom'.
