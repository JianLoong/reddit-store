{"id": 32442, "submission_id": "18c1gl7", "title": "AITA for telling my brother that his son is not a monster for not being his wife's emotional support human?", "selftext": "My nephew Greyson is 15 years old. When he was 8 his mom and unborn sister passed away after she had a placental abruption. Grey was in the car with his parents at the time it happened and he watched his mom die. My brother Ken also watched his wife die. It was incredibly traumatic for both of them. Ken fell apart and so did Grey but Ken focused more on his own grief and healing than he did on Grey's and ignored Grey's grief further when he decided 18 months later that he was ready to date again. Ken met his second wife Vera when Grey was 10 and they got married 5 months into their relationship.\n\nVera told Grey that she would do everything she could to be a good mom to him and fill the shoes his mom left better than anyone could. She \"joked\" more than once that she might even be better than his \"old mom\". That, along with Grey feeling like Ken was replacing his mom, and doing everything too fast, meant Grey never liked or bonded with Vera. She has tried very hard to get close to him but he's not interested.\n\nI tried talking to Ken about getting Grey help and talking to a therapist himself. My parents always assure Ken Grey will come around in time.\n\nA little over a year ago Ken and Vera's son was stillborn due to a fatal fetal abnormality that ran in Vera's family, which she was not aware of. She ended up needing a c-section because of complications and afterward she was no longer able to have more children. \n\nGrey did not have much of a reaction to the loss. He was open with me that he really didn't feel any grief despite everyone expecting him to. To him he lost no sibling when his half brother was stillborn. He was never excited for him or considered him anything more than his dad's baby with someone. But everyone has expected it and even our parents told Ken that Grey would fall apart in time. During all this Vera has wanted Grey to be there for her and comfort her and be the son he has never wanted to be to her.\n\nRecently Vera made a greater effort to try and get Grey to be there and comfort her. She confronted him and told him she needed him to be more caring. This happened in front of my parents and my family. She told him she feels like he doesn't care. That he can't even support his family. He told her she is not his family and he won't ever be there to support her. Ken jumped in and said it's like he doesn't care and that's sick. He then went on a rant about how Grey should be so much more concerned and loving toward Vera and he called him a monster for refusing to be there for her after the worst loss of her life. \n\nI told Ken that he shouldn't talk to Grey that way. I told him Grey is not a monster for refusing to be Vera's emotional support human and that he expected way too much given the very sour and complicated relationship that was there already.\n\nMy parents and Ken thought I was horrifically wrong for stepping in. Grey thanked me and he told me Ken doesn't get that he views him as a cold monster and that he's ashamed of him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701860074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c1gl7/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_his_son_is_not_a/", "score": 874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Men go through grieve in different ways. But most don\u2019t cope well with loneliness when they loose a spouse. I have seen it happen a lot. So they jump into a new marriage quite quickly.

He needs someone in his corner, be that person for him.\n\n Right now, it's like no one sees him as a real person, and they all expect him to finally fulfill the role they envisioned for him, which will simply never happen. Their only options are to either work on building a real relationship with the real person he is and accept the dynamics of it (dad's wife will never be a new mom to Grey, but they probably can have a loving and caring relationship), or continue to push him to play this role of a happy son, which will probably lead to him wanting to quit this show altogether. He will be an adult soon and will be able to enforce the boundaries he wants, which might as well be low contact with them.\n\nTry again talking to your brother, Grey should be in therapy, and they should do family therapy as well (father and son first only I think).

Everyone deals with grief and trauma in different ways and as a child he needs time, understanding, love, and should be seeing a professional due to the fact that he not only lost his mom and sibling but watched it!! When I was his age I had many traumatizing experiences (some I blocked out) and I never got help until my late 20's and I'm 39. It seems like you're his support system and he can talk to you. Have you tried to speak to Ken alone in a calm environment and explain what you witnessed? Him not having a reaction to Vera having a stillborn isn't uncommon and doesn't make him a monster, it makes him human. He doesn't have that connection with Vera and may not feel like he is part of the family. I'm not sure what it's like at the home or what your situation is but would it benefit him to stay with you? I'm just throwing stuff out there but he definitely needs a professional to talk to, you don't magically heal. Keep supporting him and keep defending him!!!", "NTA, your bother and Vera's actions will forever place Vera as just his Dad's wife. The lack of empathy that he was given when he lost his mother has  eliminated any real chance for a true relationship with her. \n\nI had a friend who's wife passed when their son(T)  was 5, he remarried about 2 yrs later. His new wife was an incredible blessing. She knew that there was no competing with a ghost to be the better Mom. She did not come into the relationship trying to replace his Mom. She in fact, to this day still keeps her very much alive in her stepson's life. Pictures in the  house, built a good relationship with his maternal grandparents. \n\n  I ran into them out once and told T that I knew his Mommy, and he told me that Mo(his name for his stepmom) said this his Mommy was the most beautiful angel in heaven.  Now this young man is an adult, he has 3 half -sibs and is so very kind and blessed to have so many people who love him.", "100% NTA. Feels even redundant and obvious to say it, but definitely the nephew and OP are NTA. \n\nDefinitely nephew seriously needs years of a really good therapist. Not just the death but all the comments and problems his dad has caused over the years.  Poor kid.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nWhat grey experienced would be horrific for anyone, especially a 8 year old who watched his mom die. Everyone needs to stop discussing how Grey should and will feel and get him some much needed therapy so he can start coping with what happened because it sounds like he is not. \n\nI also think its ironic that Ken is saying grey is a monster for refusing to be there for his step son when it sounds like Ken wasn't there for his son after his moms death. \n\nAs much as i feel empathy for Vera in what shes been through she is also an AH for thinking that she can be a replacement mom to grey and he will end up 'liking her better than his old mom' \n\nOP it sounds like you are the only family member that is on Grey's side and he will need you more than ever. Try and get this kid some counselling", "NTA, kids are not the parent of parents.", "Can\u2019t believe ur parents and brothers and the woman he married are treating grey like this when he is old enough he is going to go no contact with them they all deserve it thank god you r there for him", "NTA\n\nYour brother and his wife are pretty selfish.\n\nI find it reassuring that Gray speaks out and thanks you. This shows me that he trusts you and isn't completely closing himself from everbody.\n\nIs there a possibility that he can live with you? Just in case it escalates even further.\n\nTry to continue to support him and be there for him. It is important for a child to have someone they can trust.\n\nGood luck.", "I\u2019m ashamed of Ken too..stand tf up bro. STAND UP. You\u2019re telling me you couldn\u2019t do a little time raising your child and properly grieving without a woman in your life?! Like immediately sought out a help mate after your wife and unborn child passed tragically and traumatically..then just assimilate to a new family like nothing happened..like your wife is a replaceable factory piece. That\u2019s embarrassing. At least Grey has some sense of loyalty and love about him. He\u2019s gone through so much and hasn\u2019t had the chance to process it. Vera is dead wrong and has stepped wildly out of place. Sorry for her loss but literally it\u2019s nothing to do with Grey. She\u2019s just tryna solidify her takeover. Happy you stepped up for the kid..he\u2019s obviously on his own in his home and that\u2019s just so unfortunate", "NTA\n\nThankfully you wee there to stand up for this poor wean, what sort of entitled assholes are the parents to demand he shows emotional support for something he has no real emotion over, they need to accept that he is his own person with his own feelings and not some toy they can control.\n\nHe's going to need serious counselling having to put up with his ignorant father and selfish stepmom.", "NTA. Lives are complicated and this young man needs guidance and support, not whatever it is he is getting.", "Nta. I was in a similar situation growing up, my biological mom passed away when I was 13, and I became kind of a replacement for her for my grandmother and my step-dad. My biological dad's wife stepped in and called them out for a lot of innaproprate behavior, and that really saved me. You did the right thing, and you should help your nephew in anyway you can.", "NTA.  No child should ever be referred to as a monster by his parents.  Any witness to that sort of treatment is allowed to intercede.  No violence.", "Poor Grey. He\u2019s not a monster, but it sounds like he\u2019s surrounded by monsters, with the exception of you, OP. You are absolutely NTA and you did the right thing by standing up for him. It\u2019s selfish and wrong of Ken and Vera to expect and demand that he grieve their loss and that he do it in a specific, performative way to make them happy. Especially since it doesn\u2019t sound like either one of them has ever been too concerned with Grey\u2019s happiness. Glad he at least has you to support him.", "definitely NTA. your brother and parents are sick, he is very fortunate to have at least one person to be looking out for him. please dont stop because nobody else will and it\u2019s painfully obvious. i hope he finds peace and happiness", "TLDR", "NTA.\n\nBut start building a bedroom for Grey at your house, give him 6 to 8 years (depending on the country) and it will be at your house.", "NTA.  People like Vera, even if they are well-meaning, really do take the wrong approach in these kinds of situations.  They should never approach with \"I'm going to be your new mom, even better than your biological mom!\"  Their appraoch should be more like \"I am the new adult in your life.  i can't replace your mother, but I'm going to be here.  You'll need to be polite to me and listen because I'm the adult in the household, but otherwise we'll be as close as you want us to be.\"", "NTA, someone in the family has to put the child first. It's good that you are supporting and even just listening to your nephew.", "NTA  op what state do you live in you could take gray in front of a judge at 15 to get him out of there and let him be him and see and talk to.pplmwho can help for a change", "NTA.  Your nephew is so lucky to have you looking out for him, since his father and his grandparents clearly don\u2019t give a fuck about him, and his stepmother only cares about him insofar as he can do things for her.\n\nWhat an awful experience for a child to have to go through, this was really heartbreaking to read.  I\u2019m so sorry your nephew has to go through this with his family for another three years.", "So your nephew has\n\n1. witnessed his mother die right before in own eyes, and has never received any help whatsoever for his grief\n\n2. was forced into a new family when his father got married within 17 months of his mother\u2019s passing\n\n3. and is now made responsible for the emotional and mental wellbeing of his step-mother? \n\nThis is so fucked-up on so many levels. Of all these, 2.) is probably the least bad (relatively speaking), and yet so bad that it often ends in the kid cutting off contact once adult. 1.) and 3.) are just\u2026 breathtakingly shitty. Poor boy. Please continue to be there for him, and don\u2019t be afraid to alert other people who could help him.", "Yes, everyone else is allowed to grieve and get support, but Grey has never been granted that.  What devastates me is he was a child when he lost his mom and sister, a child when a strange women came in and said I\u2019m going to be a better mom than your real deceased mom, and no one except OP gave a shit about his mental health and emotional state.  Quite frankly I\u2019m amazed and proud of him that he is so well adjusted and didn\u2019t crumble under everything.", "Also, not everyone had the same reaction to miscarriages and stillbirths. I don't  think it's odd that a teenager wouldn't have bonded to an unborn sibling; even if Grey felt positive about the prospect of the baby, what he lost at this point is the possibility of a relationship, not someone he loved.", "The op s parents too for feeding the fantasy op s brother have instead of bringing him with his feet back on the ground and get their grandson help.\n\nNTA op neither is Grey everyone else is an aH", "Literally the only opinion here that matters. OP should give Grey a key to their place and set up an uber account with enough money to get there in case  Dad and step mom kick them out or Grey just needs to leave for a bit. Glad Grey has OP in their life.", "[removed]", "The whole family needs therapy.", "It may have been once the baby had arrived he may have grown to love them and view them as a sibling - it's not uncommon for siblings where there has been a stillbirth not to view the next pregnancy as a sibling until they get to take them home - purely as a protective factor\n\nI feel so sorry for Grey who has gone through far more than anyone should at that age and his dad's wife had no empathy at all", "Parents? Grey doesn't have parents. He has a father and a step mother. Only one of them is technically a parent, and a piss poor one, at that.", "And if he doesn't, I'd be offering it.", "Even if not, offering them an open place to breathe could be beneficial.", "He did suggest therapy but it seems like everyone in the family thinks it just fixes itself over time. Very toxic thinking. Ken's gonna be in the old folks home wondering why his son never visits.", "And if you have the money to spare, get him some therapy", "I have a less sunny view.  Grey might be literally \"grey\" emotionally, suppressing some fairly serious distress to deal with his overbearing stepmother and his neglectful father.", "This, plus the poor child at 9 years old had to watch his mom and unborn sister literally die in front of him. I doubt the father cares, but shutting down emotionally could be a trauma response. Loss of another unborn sibling could be triggering a lot inside him. Not that his father seems to care.", "It's extremely unlikely you'd get a teen have an emotional attachment to a fetus, particularly from uncaring step mother. \n\nKen will have no children in under 4 years. In 10 years Ken will realise he'll never know his grandchildren. It'll just be Ken and Vera wailing in their old age about how they didn't do anything wrong and deserve to see their grandchildren.", "That's how heros work. Absolutely.", "Most likely.. if dad didn't prioritise him before it's possible Grey doesn't have an outlet for his feelings. Vera and Ken are more interested in their own feelings."]}
