We're an interracial couple - he's Indian and I'm white - and while I knew this was going to present it's own unique problems, I had hoped my parents would be accepting of our relationship. They don't disapprove of him - they actually get along rather well. But they're older - mid 60s - and I think anyone who has boomer parents knows exactly where I'm going with this.\n\nThey makes racist jokes a lot. My mom told me to be careful that he doesn't make me come back to India with him and used the term \"fucking dotheads.\" My dad isn't much better. When I said how excited my partner was to have my cat come with me to the apartment, my dad went \"Maybe he wants to eat her.\"\n\nI didn't take these remarks laying down, but every protest was met with \"We aren't cracking these jokes in front of him, why are you being so sensitive?\" And even a few \"You don't appreciate how hard we work to be accepting of your relationship, give us a break.\"\n\nSo I pulled out the big guns.\n\nChristmas is a big deal to my family, always has been. I have a huge extended family, and Christmas time is the only time we can all gather together and catch up. Christmas Eve is usually spent at my aunt's house, where we exchange gifts and get wine drunk, and then Christmas Day is usually spent with the immediate family. This will be my first Christmas where I'm not living with my parents, and my mom made me swear that I would come over Christmas morning. \n\nSo I laid it out for my parents (separately, because at best my dad will let my mom steamroll over my thoughts and feelings and at worst will spin it to make it seems like I'm being inconsiderate and unreasonable.) I said, flat out, \"I don't want to have to do this, but if you keep making racist jokes or keep making excuses for the jokes, [partner] and I won't be over for Christmas morning.\"\n\nDad took it fairly well. He went quiet for a bit before going \"Alright, I'll stop. I was trying to be funny and get a rise out of you, but you're right, that isn't cool of me, I'm sorry.\"\n\nMom took it less well. She started sounding like she was going to cry and said \"You promised you would be there for Christmas morning! You PROMISED. You can't just back out of that!\"\n\nI told her that there was a very simple solution. She got angry at me and told me I had to accept her behavior because that's just how she was raised. I stood up and said, \"You're right, I do have to accept your behavior. But I don't have to tolerate it.\" Then left.\n\nLater, my dad called to tell me how upset she was and that I didn't really take her feelings into account when I threatened her, and I probably could have been nicer about it because, quote, \"You know your mom doesn't take well to this stuff.\" He thinks I took it too far.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1698417093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hovas/aita_for_threatening_to_not_come_home_for/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
