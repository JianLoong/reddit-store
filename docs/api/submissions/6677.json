She bought new clothes and obviously thought they flattered her. And you opted to poop her party. Wow YTA. If she didn't ask how they look, don't offer negative feedback. Even if she did ask, you shouldn't offer negative feedback. Tell her she looks awesome and is doing such a great job or shut your mouth.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t ask for your opinion, and not only did you share it anyway, you shared it quite harshly. You could\u2019ve not said anything at all or you could\u2019ve been more gentle. Something like \u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous and I love your body, but I feel like those pants kind of take away from how great your butt looks all on its own!\u201d", "> I was just sharing my honest opinion\n\nWhich she didn't ask for, right?

I also hate that kind of pants, think they look awful on everyone, and would never wear them. But I would never say that to someone who is in the middle of wearing them!  You\u2019re entitled to not like the pants, but you\u2019d do well to bite your tongue. Criticizing your spouse over trivial, insignificant matters never ends well.", "YTA.  Your wife is seven months postpartum, she found some pants that fit, and furthermore pants that make her feel sexy.   \n\n>  I talked to her about it later and she said how she had been feeling good about herself and I just destroyed that. That was not my intention. I was just sharing my honest opinion. \n\n\"Honest opinion\" is so often a way of saying \"I was unkind.\"  This is one of those cases.   It doesn't matter what your intention was; it matters that your wife was feeling good about herself, and you put her down.   She didn't even ask for your opinion; you just decided to lay it out, not caring how it might make her feel.\n\nDo you always expect to have veto power on her clothes?  Does she get to veto yours?", "YTA.. ever heard of being tactful? My husband wears those gigantic droopy sports shorts \ud83e\ude73all the time. I don\u2019t really like them, But I love him and he\u2019s comfortable so I\u2019m not gonna say a word.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t ask for your opinion. Reminds me of that Taylor Swift lyric, \u201cso casually cruel in the name of being honest.\u201d I dated a guy like that once.

It's a jerk move through and through.   \n\n\nYikes.", "YTA! She's had four of your kids for chrissake! Let her feel good about herself however she wants to and complement her on her efforts going to the gym instead of working to sabotage her health and self image.", "YTA \n\nShe didn't ask so it was very unnecessary to just offer your negative opinion. It's just not polite. It also isn't really clear that you were very clear that you don't like the leggings in particular and weren't making a comment on how she looked. \n\nShe's also still less than a year out from your last child which is a time to be particularly cognizant of making comments about her/her body etc (although people should always take care about how they speak to their partner regardless).", "YTA.

Now imagine you've had children, your body has been hell and you've been actively trying to change it. Replay your words again. Get it? YTA so much.

I see you've been working out and trying to feel good about your body again, so before you get too full of yourself I wanna jump right in and tell you that your workout clothes make my boner sad.

But to make her feel bad about how she looks in something that she probably bought to impress you or feel good is way wrong.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t asked for your opinion and your opinion on fashion is irrelevant for all of the reasons everyone else has already said. However you\u2019re MORE of an asshole because the entire point of those leggings is to make your butt look good. So by insulting the leggings you basically DID insult her body. Apologize asap and tell her how beautiful she is.", "YTA\n\nIt's not wrong to have an opinion. Shit I personally think combat boots are the ugliest things a woman can wear.  However it is wrong to arbitrarily just say these things. Did you have an end game in mind? Would you like her to stop wearing it? Can you come up with a different reccomendation?\n\nIt sounds like you were just saying something to provoke a reaction. That's the asshole part.\n\nRemember. Having an opinion and voicing it without cause or solution are two very separate actions.", "YTA. She\u2019s had 2 babies within 2 years and is starting to work to feel better about her body and herself. Your comment was simple, honest, and innocent enough, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with disliking the pants. However, you should really have considered how she might have felt and how it could\u2019ve impacted her body image when you said it.", "YTA\n\nYou could've approached her in so many ways about this. Regardless, this was your personal opinion, she was just buying whatever she thought she liked.

As someone who has been married twice as long as you, let me give you some advice: don\u2019t give your wife unsolicited opinions on her clothing choices.", "YTA.

What were you thinking? She has given you 4 children, wrecked her body doing it and is just getting back on track from the last one and THIS is how you react to a pair of leggings? Unless you look like Jason Momoa on a good day (and I'm betting you don't)- you have no right to comment on how a woman looks, and especially not your wife. You have done a lot of damage with your throwaway comments. Get your credit card ready and start grovelling.", "My wife has had 4 babies in the last 6 years. Shes been going to the gym, and bought some new clothes.  Instead of being a supporting husband I told her I hate her pants, that I think they're ugly.  YTA.", "YTA - I get the feeling from her response that she understood what you said as she didn't look good in those pants instead of you don't like that style of pants.  If you meant the latter, it's already too late to explain yourself.   Either way an apology is due.", "YTA. The point of those pants is to get people to look at your ass. She wanted attention, attraction, not criticism. Even if you didn't like them, the better answer would have been to wait until she was out of them then jump her bones. Then tactfully dealt with the pants at a later time.", "Did she ask you?\n\nMy general rule is this- if you\u2019re commenting on someone\u2019s appearance, answer ONLY what they asked you about.

I have a pair because my husband wanted to see if they really \"worked\" (they kinda do), and the scrunch part really isn't as intrusive as it looks, so you don't really feel it. The ones I have are actually pretty comfy because the waist stays in place well when you move, which is SO hard to find, no matter what size you are, but especially as a woman with a waist 13\" smaller than my hips. I adjust those leggings during a workout less than half as often as most of my other workout pants.", "I was just talking leggings in general, not the specific \u201cscrunch bum\u201d leggings. But yes, I\u2019m wearing mine right now and they are sooo comfy. It\u2019s almost like wearing no pants lol", "awfully confident in your assertion that nobody wants to see womens buttholes", "WARNING!\n\nYou have rendered an unsolicited opinion!\n\nPrepare for evisceration!", "Gotta love Reddit", "I have tried them on twice and had to borrow a pair for a few hours and I felt like I was constantly picking my butt to get them out.  You go enjoy em.", "I was a kid in the 80\u2019s and I thought the thong over leggings was weird too. Lol.", "Sympathy. For me it\u2019s the front leg creases that get sweaty in summer. I used to work in an unairconditioned factory, and my work station was in the 90s all day.", "eShakti.\n\nI've made peace with my clothing being made in India instead of the US.  Nowhere I can find in the US wants to give me clothing that fits a tall, curvy woman with smaller breasts, let alone pockets.\n\nI like their dresses so much that I've bought 6 of them for my oldest daughter as she's grown.  I'm not even sure how many for myself anymore but I wear them every day.", "Could be eShakti.", "SEA!", "Yep. I\u2019m tallish with all my height in my body so finding dresses that fit right is impossible off the rack. Eshakti is the best.", "Yay Eshakti!  I get all of my dresses there!  I\u2019ve had so many people ask me where I get them.\n\nI\u2019ve probably gotten easily three dozen dresses there over the years (I love casual dresses and prefer them to pants).  My biggest complaint about them is I wish they\u2019d use higher quality fabrics - I\u2019d pay more for them.  However, they are so reasonably priced, I can buy as many as I want.\n\nEdit: spelling", "I love my eShakti dresses. They hold up well too. I have a red knit dress I wear at Christmas. It\u2019s probably 4 years old now and still in perfect shape.", "I just went to the site and I\u2019m obsessed. Thank you!", "You just described me!!! Tall (6\u20193\u201d), curvy, a/b cup. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb", "\ud83d\udcdd \nThank you, kind stranger. If I had trophies, I\u2019d give you one. Or fifty.", "Ooh thank you! I have to check this out \ud83d\ude0a", "Me too!! I'm a teacher and my work wardrobe has improved so much. Comfy. Well constructed. Pockets.", "Thank you! 6'1\" and didn't know about this brand! Also I love that this thread is \"yes, you're a dick, now let's all talk dresses\"", "My favorite so far has a jersey knit top with embroidery and a dupioni shiny skirt.\n\nI only buy the machine washable fabrics.\n\nI definitely wish for more variety in fabric quality and durability.", "5'10\", curvy, B cup thanks to 3 kids.  Was A cup before.  \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI love being tall.  It's the easiest part of my body to accept and love as is.  It's just so dang hard to dress all this height.  I can only imagine with your extra 5 inches.", "Aww.  \ud83e\udd70\n\nKnowing that other dress wearers know where to find pockets is trophy enough."]}
