I really feel like you are trying to help him and it's coming from a state of caring, but just like your friend, your approach is all wrong. His level of attractiveness isn't important, that's pretty subjective anyway, what he needs to work on is his personality. Some therapy might help with this, a professional could help him gain some insight on how what he's doing isn't working, while helping build his self-esteem in a constructive way. I hope he's okay, and I'm glad he has you for a friend", "Ima go ESH. Your friend sounds hella creepy but you preface it by talking about your friend is not \u201cobjectively beautiful\u201d which makes it sound like you think that\u2019s the issue. Attractiveness doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s just creepy.", "NTA. I had a friend more or less like yours. He was mildly unattractive but very smart and interesting. He kept pursuing girls very beautiful but maybe not interested in the same things as him only cos they were beautiful, and at the same time he complained that women were shallow because they always went for the tall, handsome men.\n\nOne day your friend will find the right girl, but obsessing and texting compulsively to a clearly not interested girl it's just a an annoying habit, he should really quit.", "Naw. NTA. I think true friends can be open and honest with each other. If he\u2019s a 3 and the girls he keeps trying to get are a 9 or 10, he needs to know he\u2019s shooting a bit too high. He can go to school and get into a profession where he makes bank then he will get a 9 or 10 pretty easy if that\u2019s all he cares about. Until then, if he wants a girlfriend he needs to aim a bit lower\u2026 that is if that is the only issue and reason he gets turned down. It sounds like he may be needy and pushy and personally, that would turn anyone off so it may be a lose lose for him and someone\u2019s gotta break it to him.", "NTA- but you can\u2019t change someone, they need to realise what they\u2019re doing is wrong", "NTA. But consider: (1) not offering unsolicited advice; (2) how much do you really like this person and why.", "ESH\n\nYour friend sounds like a creep, it's not a problem with how he looks, it's how he interacts with people. That's why he sucks.\n\nYou suck for saying it's about how he looks instead of how he treats people, and being kinda rude about it.\n\nHelp him figure out how to treat women well, and respect them.", "ESH.\n\nThe guy doesn't have to be beautiful to be able to get with a girl that is, there is no 'too high' as beauty is not a linear scale, it is subjective. Some people love things like glasses, braces, freckles etc. that some people with them see as 'imperfections' that diminish their beauty, while others can see them as a bonus or only adding to their beauty.\n\nBut you might want to stop calling this guy a friend, nevermind your 'best friend' because he sounds like an incel. He is harassing girls and refuses to learn his lesson that chasing someone hard, makes them run, it doesn't make them want him. He needs to work on building confidence in himself and not hard clinging to anyone he finds attractive if he wants things to improve, but he doesn't sound like he wants to improve, he just wants his one method to work, when it really isn't surprising to anyone except him that it doesn't.", "Empathizing with the girls is the appropriate feeling here.\n\nNTA", "NTA he's repeating the same actions over and over despite those actions chasing away the girls he's into. Isn't that the definition of insanity?", "Being realistic is something good people do.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHe needed a reality check. His behavior has creeped out every girl he\u2019s convinced to give him attention. If the fact he keeps behaving the same way every single time, yet getting the same result doesn\u2019t motivate him to change, nothing will. \n\nHe needs to evaluate his self confidence. He also needs to be aware no one, even women, owe him anything, not even their constant undivided attention. Clinginess and text bombardment are mere steps away from full-blown stalking. He needs to knock it off. \n\nYou were trying to be his friend by giving him sound advice. He doesn\u2019t want to heed it, so his loss. I just hope the next girl that comes along is all le to extricate herself safely, because he\u2019s just going to escalate as he gets more frustrated.", "I don\u2019t think his reaction to liking a girl (obsessively texting) has anything to do with his standards of girls", "NAH. Your mistake is telling him what not to do, rather than what to do. I don't fault you for it.", "ESH.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem a pretty face would solve, and Y T A for thinking and saying it would.  It\u2019s really the dysfunctional way he approaches romance that is the problem.\n\nYour friend\u2019s approach to romantic relationships is the problem - you can\u2019t just fling yourself at people, and letting a person you hardly know affect your world to the point where you want to die.  Your friend needs therapy.  He needs to learn what it looks like when you\u2019re just starting out in a normal, healthy relationship.  How things start, how they progress, how fast you get to know each other, how actually falling in love happens.  Because your friend is mistaking limerence for love, which is commonly a response to past emotional trauma, and in the process is compounding his trauma and hurting himself more.  The kind of advice you could give won\u2019t really help, he needs professional help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is setting himself up for failure by bombarding women with attention. All you did was point that out.

I probably only made the situation worse without realizing the importance this thing has for him and I was very superficial", "This is why I am in doubt.\nI'm afraid my opinion of his outward appearance is too harsh, and therefore I rate what he does too harshly.\nI know he's a great person and deserves a relationship, but I also think it's hard for a model to fall in love with a stranger who torments her", "You got it right, him is a very interessing, Smart, funny and supportive persone. But him always aim to almost model girl, ignoring the normal looking/interessing girl who try to talk to him.

That\u2019s not a healthy dynamic. That means you can\u2019t help him, you can only enable him to continue his self-defeating approach. A pretty depressing perspective for your friendship.", "Ehh, because you didn't address the part of my comment where I suggested how you could help him improve his communication and interactions with women and instead focused on the tiny but that was more critical of you, I'm going to stick with ESH, you're not making your position any better.", "They are two separate issues then and I\u2019d say working on the obsession is more important still", "He follows a consistent pattern of harassing women until they\u2019re forced to be very blunt about wanting to be left alone, and then he contemplates suicide.
