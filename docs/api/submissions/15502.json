If she was actually struggling with her mental health, the most supportive and kindest thing to do would be to give her a chance to take her place in her OWN child's lofe as her mother.\n\nNow I'm not saying that you should give your sister her child and be done with it. No. This type of family feunifications shoild be a slow and careful process mediated by social workers, supervised visitations, your sister needs to prove that she is fit to be a mother, etc. It's gonna be work, but your sister deserves that.\n\nBtw, does the kid know that you're her aunt?

Your sister is making steps to gain custody of her daughter again.  She is the parent and should By default have custody unless that child is in serious danger with her.  She felt like she couldn't look after the child in the past and instead of neglecting her daughter she left her with a family member while she got her life together. By the sounds of it you won't even consider shared custody.  You could even suggest this as a private arrangement with your sister.

Your sister is self centered and is only thinking of herself, she is not at all thinking about what is best for the little girl. A healthy approach would have been for her to slowly reintroduce herself back into her daughters life, working with you as a team, consulting you on how best this reintroduction could be done, as you know the child best, without putting the child under an sort of pressure to have to do anything that she doesn't want to do, or isn't comfortable in doing.  Her blood affiliation to you does not erase the rules of descency. Furthermore, the child's mental health comes first in this situation.  Even if you find yourself in moments of empathy towards your sister, the empathy that you have for the child must comes first. Empathy served in the wrong places will only enable and fuel narcissistic behavior. The love that you may hold for your sister has nothing to do with what is best for the child.

She already has a mother.", "\"Her child\"", "Sounds OP has full legal rights to the child already.  It might be different if she did not and mother could still claim the child.  But if the child has been legally adopted by the aunt, I dont think the mother has any legal claim.", "I can say where I live she would lose for sure. Best interest of the child is to stay in a stable environment.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but kids aren\u2019t property you can just foist onto other family members until you feel \u201cready\u201d to be a parent again.\n\nI would feel different in a situation where the mother have the aunt temporary custody in order to improve her mental health or situation. Disappearing for 5 years with no contact doesn\u2019t show the same judgement.", "And only communicate through your lawyer.", "Courts are not going to look favorably on a mother that literally abandons their child on a doorstep and disappears for half a decade.\n\nIn fact, if OP is her niece's legal guardian then it's highly likely that the court will state there is nothing they can do.\n\nNot every dispute can be resolved in a courtroom.", "I love that this is your position, from how it's written it seems to be a knowledgeable opinion. It's beautiful when the justice system (though still kinda weird that family court is part of that) works.\n\nIn my particular county, the Family Court Judges are rotated every couple of years, whether they want to be there or not. Most don't want to be there. It's apparent when they refuse to look at financial evidence and testimony of Child experts \ud83e\udd23 I wish I was kidding. I'm glad it works in your area!", "My thoughts too. Not only should OP fight for her niece if it goes to court, but OP needs to notify the school (if not already) that the biological mother cannot take her out of school. Worked as a pediatric nurse for years and non-custodial parent abductions happen frequently.", "It's typically money or a new partner.", "Anyone who is thinking about the child\u2019s best interest knows \u2018remaining in stable, loving environment that is familiar, with people she knows and loves\u2019 is the right call. \n\nOp\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t give a flying frick about this little girl, she is thinking only about herself. No change over that half decade it seems.", "Yeah the sister doesn\u2019t care if the child is ripped from the only loving home she has known. OP needs to file for permanent custody ASAP.", "Not a fact. I work with a woman (a pediatrician) who took in the care of a girl during her residency. Doctors didn\u2019t expect the little girl to make it after she was born. My coworker stayed with her during the few hours she had free. She ended up getting custody via the foster system. She had the girl until the girl was 6. When the girl was 6 she had to go back to her mother. I was shocked that it could happen. \n\nMy in-laws have a little boy whose mom placed him in their care (long story how it happened). He\u2019s been a part of our lives for around 5 years. His mom calls every 1-6 months\u2026maybe. At any moment the mom can come in and say she wants him back. At least in that situation the bio mom has some form of contact but still, he\u2019s a part of our family.", "It\u2019s a form of adoption and both for custody appointments AND adoptions, biological parents are given extreme leeway. A child you raised and bonded with for years can be snatched away from you by the biological parent. I don\u2019t understand how adoption would have made this easy if the same thing happens in adoptions?", "That was my question the whole time I was reading this. If this child was abandoned by her bio mother, then why hasn't OP sought parental termination and adoption?", "Yes it does. That\u2019s literally what \u201ccustody\u201d means. It\u2019s a legal term.", "Op never said she legally adopted", "The court telling the biological mother a firm No sounds like a resolution to me.", "Yeah, notify that only OP can pick her up.", "Foster system is different from full custody, though. Foster the goal is supposed to always be to reunite the child with the parents. In a custodial arrangement that isn\u2019t through foster care, this is different. OP has a decent chance with a good lawyer to keep the child protected. Just because the sister claims she\u2019s doing better does not make it true and it could be genuinely dangerous for the seven year old. And a good lawyer will bring this to the judge.", "In the foster system if you go no contact for over two years they sever rights", "An adoption is a finalized process. Foster care is not an adoption, although it can lead to it. Guardianship is a separate process that grants custody (usually best for cases like this, where a family member is able and willing to assume custody.) A granted guardianship typically has a \"to do\" list for parent to resume custody. Whatever route OP took, her sister's parental rights would need to be terminated before she could adopt. Doesn't sound like that was the case, or the sister wouldn't have anything close to a case.", "It requires clarification.", "Did she abandon her or did she place the child in a loving home when she sought medical assistance for herself. I feel like compassionate understanding is that she knew she wasn't in a position to obe a parent in that moment and did the right thing.", "I understand the distinction. What I\u2019m trying to explain is that EVEN in the most ironclad version of all these - which is full adoption - you can still be sued and lose the custody of your child to a biological parent. I\u2019m not arguing that OP\u2019s case is not different or not on more shaky ground or whatnot; I\u2019m simply saying that in every version of this process a deadbeat biological parent can swing by 5 years later and actually have a chance at taking the child from you. It has happened and continues to happen.", "Nah man, i definitely support and understand mental health issues but what she did was abandonment. Like she didn\u2019t even know that the sister was home or would take the child in. Also she\u2019s been no contact for five years. If she cared she would have stayed in contact in some way while she got better. This is abandonment.", "Incorrect. For an adoption to be finalized, a bio parent would have had to have their parental rights terminated. They would have no case to bring. Everything else? Yeah, it's fair game.", ">So you are suggesting that she owes it to her sister to let her have custody?\n\nNo, she owed her daughter a mother who didn't drop her as soon as the going gets tough. She failed that obligation, and the daughter now has a mother that will never abandon her. Now that same mother wants to come and take the 1 stable thing her daughter has found away from her? No way."]}
