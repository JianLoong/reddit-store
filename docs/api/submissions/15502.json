If she was actually struggling with her mental health, the most supportive and kindest thing to do would be to give her a chance to take her place in her OWN child's lofe as her mother.\n\nNow I'm not saying that you should give your sister her child and be done with it. No. This type of family feunifications shoild be a slow and careful process mediated by social workers, supervised visitations, your sister needs to prove that she is fit to be a mother, etc. It's gonna be work, but your sister deserves that.\n\nBtw, does the kid know that you're her aunt?

Your sister is making steps to gain custody of her daughter again.  She is the parent and should By default have custody unless that child is in serious danger with her.  She felt like she couldn't look after the child in the past and instead of neglecting her daughter she left her with a family member while she got her life together. By the sounds of it you won't even consider shared custody.  You could even suggest this as a private arrangement with your sister.

Your sister is self centered and is only thinking of herself, she is not at all thinking about what is best for the little girl. A healthy approach would have been for her to slowly reintroduce herself back into her daughters life, working with you as a team, consulting you on how best this reintroduction could be done, as you know the child best, without putting the child under an sort of pressure to have to do anything that she doesn't want to do, or isn't comfortable in doing.  Her blood affiliation to you does not erase the rules of descency. Furthermore, the child's mental health comes first in this situation.  Even if you find yourself in moments of empathy towards your sister, the empathy that you have for the child must comes first. Empathy served in the wrong places will only enable and fuel narcissistic behavior. The love that you may hold for your sister has nothing to do with what is best for the child.

To give her to her mother now would only be disastrous for the little girl! I am sure you have legally a good stand, but I would not keep it as no contact. Rather that your sister has to show she wants to step up and being able to maintain that for a long period of time. Meaning that she is an stranger to her own kid, having giving birth isn\u2019t automatically bring a bond between mother and child. She needs to start slowly, with coming over to actually visiting you and her, together. Once the kid feels ok with it, they can go for lunches or movies or such together. Your sister needs to show she wants this, that she is willing and capable to maintain consistency. First when the girl is ok with it, then maybe sleepovers can happen. \n\nIn the end, a few years will pass and later the kid should have a voice for herself. But just giving her back like that now?

Generally, there needs to be a period of time during which the parent does not have any contact with the child and does not pay child support.

That's her mom, parenthood isn't a one strike and you're out kinda deal. It's ongoing for life. I 100% understand that you've made a life changing commitment and put untold effort and love into this child and are likely doing everything right. That's still her mom, and if mom is better, there's no reason to exclude her from the child's life.", "I thought this was more a thing when CPS takes the kid (against the parent's will) due to substance abuse/neglect/physical abuse and places them in foster care. That's a totally different situation than a parent voluntarily giving a child up for adoption and calling takebacksies.", "This isn\u2019t what happens with adoption at all. If a child has been adopted then no bio parent can come back and get custody, you\u2019re not correct here. Foster care this can happen but not adoption.", "And other family members.", "Nothing wrong with that if they aren\u2019t claiming to be the parent.. I\u2019ve taken my friends kids to the doctors before and that\u2019s totally fine.", "Wow, this may be the most sexist thing i've read on this website in awhile. Just because you've only attracted deadbeat men, doesn't mean we all are.", "It gets a little murky sometimes when the person going to the appointments wants information after the fact. Which they assume they can get since they've been going to appointments", "Actually, I do. I was a paralegal to an attorney that practiced general law, including family law. IANAL and all that, but I've seen some things.", "Bless you OP for stepping up for that poor child\\~ NTA and get that lawyer. She has to prove over time that she's stable enough and will not harm the child before you can consider giving the daughter back.", "Did you get custody? In my state, once a legal guardian takes custody, the biological parent can only get their kids back if the guardian agrees. I have custody of two kids who were abandoned by their bio parents, and my lawyer has assured me that their bio parents can't get them back unless I agree.", "we got permanent custody of our nieces and their parents would not have been able to get them back unless they could prove we were unfit. It all depends on the legal status of OP which she has not answered", "A friend of mine went through something like that. They took custody of her nephew from the day he was born due to Mom's drug use. She kept missing court dates, skipping drug tests, ignoring the mandated parenting classes. And she still got her visitation every week. It broke my friend's heart-- they did everything for that baby, and wanted him. But they didn't want to be the foster parents who gave their whole hearts to a baby that could get taken away.", "My parents did, the girls grandparents, that had never been in any trouble & owned their own small business. California sucks.", "It did explain her mood, at least ..."]}
