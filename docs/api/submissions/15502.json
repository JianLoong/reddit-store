If she was actually struggling with her mental health, the most supportive and kindest thing to do would be to give her a chance to take her place in her OWN child's lofe as her mother.\n\nNow I'm not saying that you should give your sister her child and be done with it. No. This type of family feunifications shoild be a slow and careful process mediated by social workers, supervised visitations, your sister needs to prove that she is fit to be a mother, etc. It's gonna be work, but your sister deserves that.\n\nBtw, does the kid know that you're her aunt?

Your sister is making steps to gain custody of her daughter again.  She is the parent and should By default have custody unless that child is in serious danger with her.  She felt like she couldn't look after the child in the past and instead of neglecting her daughter she left her with a family member while she got her life together. By the sounds of it you won't even consider shared custody.  You could even suggest this as a private arrangement with your sister.

Your sister is self centered and is only thinking of herself, she is not at all thinking about what is best for the little girl. A healthy approach would have been for her to slowly reintroduce herself back into her daughters life, working with you as a team, consulting you on how best this reintroduction could be done, as you know the child best, without putting the child under an sort of pressure to have to do anything that she doesn't want to do, or isn't comfortable in doing.  Her blood affiliation to you does not erase the rules of descency. Furthermore, the child's mental health comes first in this situation.  Even if you find yourself in moments of empathy towards your sister, the empathy that you have for the child must comes first. Empathy served in the wrong places will only enable and fuel narcissistic behavior. The love that you may hold for your sister has nothing to do with what is best for the child.

I can also share from a decade of experience in this area of law that it is very likely the mother will get an opportunity to regain custody. It is probable she will have supervised visitation and maybe drug testing, etc. At this age most courts don't give children a chance to voice their preference in a court setting.
