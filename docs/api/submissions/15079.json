This is not a gift. This is a chore. He put the bills and the work on you for him to have something to play with of he feels like it. \n\n\nYou told him no. This is very obviously a very swlfish thing to do.", "NTA.\n\n>he asked if I wanted a puppy, I said no, he got it anyway\n\nThere is something deeply wrong here. You are not the problem.", "Dogs are not gifts. They are commitments. And in most cases an over a decade one. He was completely irresponsible, immature and sly. It\u2019s unfair to you, but frankly in this situation the worse off is the dog. That pup is quickly learning about the world, fears and feelings. He\u2019s risking messing this pup up. Choosing a dog is a big deal to determine if your lifestyle suits that dog. It should be carefully considered one. Plus what does it say about his respect of you that he can make such a huge potential 15 year commitment on your behalf without asking and calling you the cruel one. NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is and questionable.", "NTA\n\nyou said no. whats the point of buying a gift someone doesnt want anyway? that makes no sense. can you gift chores too? lol.", "NTA - that doesn't sound like a present for you at all. And him calling you heartless for wanting the dog to have a loving home is a massive red flag. As is ignoring your direct wishes.\n\nIs this a pattern of behaviour? If so, are you sure you want to marry this man? It seems like you might be walking into a life of at best, ignoring your wants. At worst, gradually escalating abuse.", "Don't marry this man. Get out whilst you can.\n\nHe has no care for the dog. You on the other hand are clearly empathetic and sensible. You need to rehome the puppy asap. Then leave.", "NTA regardless of other reasoning, him asking and you saying no should have put an immediate stop to it. This would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA. He is manipulating you. He wanted the dog and went ahead and got it anyway. He probably hoped you'd fall in love and change your mind, but since you haven't you're now 'heartless' and 'mean'.\n\nYou're not heartless and mean. You set up clear boundaries and he ignored them. I'd seriously look at the rest of the relationship. If he's willing to try and manipulate you over this, he's more than capable of doing so in another area.", "NTA - I assume HE wanted a dog", "NTA, this is a very manipulative and irresponsible gift. He gave it to you, so it's your responsibility to look after it. He's putting you in the position of being \"heartless\" if you are ungrateful, yet owning a dog is a huge long-term responsibility, not something that you should take on without serious forethought. You don't say what kind of dog it is, and you don't know if it will be a suitable breed for an apartment/ a resident cat/ your lifestyle. \n\nA lot of people choose their pet dog based on how cute it is and how it will add to their Instagram feed; I believe strongly that you should figure out what kind of owner you would be so you can pick a dog that you can look after responsibly. Eg, I wouldn't be a good owner to a dog that needs a lot of grooming or a small yappy dog, but I am an excellent owner to a dog that needs to be walked twice a day on schedule. \n\nAlso it seems like your boyfriend wants the dog but not the responsibility, he wants the fun but not the serious conversation - so he has definitely sidestepped all the mature approaches by making this a \"gift\". When the dog is hard work or trouble, it will be your dog. You haven't had a chance to prepare or figure out how to work your current schedule around the dog's needs. \n\nI would suggest rehoming the dog as soon as possible so it has minimal disruption. You might need to rehome the boyfriend too if he has such little respect for your relationship as a partnership.", "NTA\n\nWhy do people still have to learn that PETS ARN'T GIFTS for crying out loud?  \nOnly, and really ONLY, if the person you are getting a pet for explicitly stated, that he/she want a pet AND you know what kind of pet AND you know the person is fine with the pet and can carry for it, it might be ok to gift a pet.", "Did anyone else read the title and think the dog was Mensa level smart?", "NTA\n\nAnimals are not a gift! Never. \n\nFurthermore you told him that you didn\u2018t want a puppy. He obviously doesn\u2018t respect your wishes and opinions. \n\nThis is a major red flag and a pour little soul will suffer because the puppy wants love and bonding and now they have to be rehomed and wait for love.\n\nAlso, don\u2018t let him pressure and guilt-trip you to keep the puppy that you do not want and that you cannot offer adequate space and financial stability.", "Yeah, no. Raising a puppy is a lot of work and exhausting even if you chose to get one, but being forced into becoming a pet parent against your express wishes and then being shamed for objecting is an AH move by your fianc\u00e9. Has he explained to you why he disrespected your wishes? Is it that HE wanted a puppy and thought you couldn\u2019t say \u201cNo\u201d if he gave you one as a gift? Is this the first time he\u2019s blatantly ignored your wishes? If I were you I would not let this one go and insist on getting to the bottom of his reasoning and his intentions. And you should give the puppy back, for all the reasons mentioned and the fact that you simply don\u2019t want one.

Sounds like a bad move not only to you, but also to the puppy, because they dont get everything they deserve due to lack of money and love (not meant in a mean way, but i think animals are sensible and they might realize somehow when someone isnt fond of them that much.) Also maybe a bad move to the kitty because they might not get along.", "NTA, seems like he wanted a dog and 'gifted' one to you. You have all the right to not want a pet, he should have discussed it wit you and respected you, getting a dog is not a small decision.", "NTA. Is it possible, that your fian\u00e9 just wanted a dog but know you wouldn't like it. So he thaugh \"If i give it to her as a present, she has to like it\"? Animals should never be a gift unless the person gifted really know how to handle  the animal, is able to care for it and wants it. \n\nSorry, don't know any advices how to handle this kind of situation", "NTA. I agree with rehoming both the puppy and the boyfriend. He ignored your wishes and is manipulating your emotions to try to keep the puppy which is clearly a gift for him, not you.", "NTA. Clearly he wanted a puppy and got it as a \u201cgift\u201d for you when it was really for him.", "NTA. Sounds like he wanted a dog, and knowing you are not a dog person, the only way he could get away with it was to do it under the guise of a gift to you, knowing you would look bad if you refused it.", "You need to give it back! This is shameful behavior in his part. A. Not respecting YOU!and B. You will not lioe this dog that is needed, dogs have a keen sense that will know you don\u2019t love and care for him. This makes me furious! NTA!", "Y.t.a for making me think you were offered a gifted dog with talents because I was so excited to find out how exactly this dog was gifted (jk nta)", "NTA, it seems like a gift for himself, I mean you literally told him you didn't want one and got one anyway.", "NTA\n\nAnd based on what you wrote, you really need to re evaluate your releationship (setting a fact to something you are against and said no to).", "Nta.\nHe asked, you said no. That should have been it. As much as people love seeing posts of 'teehee he didn',t want the cat, now he loves it' it doesn't make it right. Pets are a commitment, and something you both should agree to", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not a dog person, and you told him \u201cno\u201d, so this gift is literally delusional. The kitten also has costs, and costs time. You aren\u2019t \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201cmean\u201d for being *logical*. I hate guilt tripping\u2026", "If your bf can make a unilateral decision so can you.\n\nRegift that \"gift\" to a rescue asap to give them the best chance of finding a new and loving forever home.\n\nTell bf that he can also be rehomed (but you need to mean it) unless you want your clear wishes, expectations and boundaries trampled on repeatedly in the future. This relationship looks doomed, but he may be able to learn from this. Can you?", "NTA.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e wanted a dog, got told no, bought one anyway, and then presented it as an unwanted gift. In other words: Your fianc\u00e9e bought a dog in spite of your disagreement. \n\nYou should have some stern words with your fianc\u00e9e about how joint decisions in a household work.\n\nAnd return the unwanted dog. If he complains then point out it is your dog.", "NTA First, animals aren't something to be gifted. Second, pets in a shared household are two yeses & one no. He asked & you said no. That's where it should have ended unless you changed your mind. \n\nThe fact that he ignored what you said & now is surprised Pikachu because you're not delighted by his \"gift\" is a red flag. Again, you said no & yet he still did what he wanted & is now trying to make you the bad guy for not going along with him steamrolling you into caring for a dog that is obvious that *he* wanted, but expects you to take care of. After all, why \"gift\" it to you when he knew you didn't want a dog?\n\nAnimals are a huge responsibility & you didn't agree nor sign up for this puppy. He's put both you & the puppy in a horrible position for being selfish & getting it knowing you weren't on board. \n\nI know it sounds cruel, but find a good home for the puppy that is happy to have it. Your bf did \"gift\" him to you after all, & you would be doing the responsible thing by making sure it's cared for the best way possible. \n\nAs for your bf, I'd wave a treat at the car door until he hopped in & then drive him to the nearest shelter (family/friends) & drop him off. But ultimately, that's your choice to make. Don't let him guilt you & please make sure the puppy isn't mistreated & finds a good & loving home.", "NTA. You don\u2019t gift people animals unless it is something you have discussed prior and have both agreed on. They are a big commitment.", "NTA\n\nHe bought this puppy for himself, not as a gift for you. But you need to make a decision on what to do with the puppy quickly, whether you keep him or speak to the breeder/shelter.", "NTA. You gave valid reasons why you didn't want a puppy. Your 3rd and 4th reasons are the most important.\n\nIf he wants a puppy for himself he should be honest about it and not getting one under this pretext.  \nHe is not respecting you or the dog itself. Find out where he got the dog from and return him. In case he paid for it, see if you can get a restitution and give him the money back.\n\nHe might call you spoiled, selfish and whatever for returning a gift. Remember this, you have told him you never wanted a dog. Stand your ground.   \nGetting a pet is a joint decision which needs 'yes' of both you and your fianc\u00e9 but only needs one 'No' to stop it.", "NTA. Absolutely a situation where you were consulted, gave your answer, and that should have been the end of it. \n\nWhat you were given is not a gift.

I wouldn\u2019t consider it a gift for you. That said your bf obviously really really wanted this dog, he has just gone about it in a ridiculous way so you couldn\u2019t refuse. Can you bring yourself to accept the dog? If not please make sure he goes to a good home.", "NTA you don\u2019t gift someone a 15 year day in and day out commitment.

Two yes, one no, when you're living with a partner. Because literally no matter what kind of pet it is, there is going to be *some* level of responsibility on both people to care for the animal. \n\nEven \"low-maintenance\" animals often aren't, not if they're being properly cared for. And even \"low-maintenance\" tasks can be draining when added to an already-full plate of someone who didn't want the damn animal in the first place. \n\nAnd a dog is one of the highest-maintenance animals you can get. It's basically a toddler. For 15 years. \n\nMy husband, before we were married, once brought home a pet I didn't want, and it was absolute torture for years. It was a very high-maintenance pet, and most of the maintenance fell to me because he traveled for work a lot at the time.

Shelly is ok.", "2 yes's, 1 no... it works well in so many situations I use it more and more", "There was a huge campaign in the UK with just one line that sums it up.\n\nA dog is for life, not just for Christmas.", "With that info in mind, am I the only one getting the feeling that the new puppy might be fianc\u00e9\u2019s attempt at putting the breaks on the whole baby idea? \u201cHoney we can\u2019t have a baby right now, look at how busy we are with the puppy. Let\u2019s put it off for a while until it\u2019s a little older.\u201d", "Holy hell after browsing her posts and comments I am horrified. OP, GET OUT NOW. You are going to regret this. And get into therapy to deal with whatever has kept you with this person.", "Thanks for pointing out the post history because... yikes. Is this boyfriend the same one as in the RJ post? If it is it's really not great.", "Yeah. I'd start with \"Do you want the ring back?\"", "Especially a responsibility that last for years!", "Totally agree. I love my dogs but they are a lot of work and very expensive.", ">But am I the only one that read \u201cgifted \u201cas the dog being some sort of genius, prodigy puppy\n\nI dislike the denominalization (or verbing) of \"gift.\" \n\nSigh!\n\nI tend to have the same confusion!!!", "We have a Labrador that can work the electric recliners and open his food bin amongst other things. My first thought, as well.", "I was thinking the same thing!", "Yes! Lol my sleepy self was like okay, is this a problem people have?", "That's the whole reason I clicked on this post lol", "He probably has no idea that his behaviour is problematic. Men like these never do. Then the gf dumps them and they're completely clueless as to why.", "Which would be fair too. There is still a huge difference between having time and money to care for a dog that needs walks and cuddles and caring for a dog that needs walks, cuddles, and a stimulating environment.", "I joke that my hellions have two tricks: they know how to love, and how to be loved!\n\nThey're juuuuuuust about getting sit. \n\nBut only if they're a treat involved!", "It's veery close to baby trapping, IMO.", "I can't speak for everyone but this would make me consider calling it off. In fact I think at this stage I probably would have unless there was some major acknowledgment of what he did and why it was wrong. OP did not mention that they had children yet, it will.only be harder to leave down the line. Such a big red flag.", "He asked her if she wanted a 15 year commitment to an animal. She said no. He got her a 15 year commitment anyway. \n\nThis isn't just him buying a necklace she doesn't like without asking her. This is ignoring her wishes and trying to guilt her into taking responsibility for an animal she never wanted in the first place.", "Nope. Nope. Nope. My puppy has cost me thousands. Sure there's the \"figuring out she could get into the kitchen cupboards and now $2k spent at the vet\". But Monthly and yearly expenses alone add up quickly and vet med and dog food are only going up in cost- it's still thousands without counting any 'emergencies'. \n\nWhat's fucking childish is having a conversation with your partner about bringing an animal that requires a lot of detailed care, not listening to their very valid reasons for not wanting ANOTHER baby animal to raise and getting them one anyways and being surprised they're not happy. \n\nI hope he figures out how to listen like a grown up and give gifts that are actually something his partner wants and listens to her concerns and validates them. I hope he figures out how to be a responsible adult to animals and the situations he puts them in. And till then, I hope he keeps getting dumped. \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's not at all because this action shows he's really selfish, he's really irresponsible when it comes to caring for a living animal and he doesn't listen to her. It speaks volumes about what kind of person he is, particularly his response when she called him out on it.", "Its not about the puppy. Its about him asking, her saying no, and him doing it anyway. Its about making a decision that will affect both of them when she said no. It shows how he handles things they don't agree on. \n\nWhat about when its a house? He sees a house he likes, and she doesn't agree(and has valid concerns), and he goes and makes the down payment? What about if she doesn't want a kid and he wants one, and he tempers with her birth control? Of course these seem like way bigger issues, but past behaviour is an indicator of future behaviour. I wouldn't advise her to stay either. \n\nIts never about the puppy, the dishes in the sink, the clothes that are not in the hamper, or the small issues. Its about mutual respect and treating a partner like a partner.", "He didn't give her a puppy.  He got HIMSELF a dog when she very clearly stated she didn't want one in the apartment, and he did it under the guise of a \"gift,\" hoping it would guilt her into not being pissed about it.", "That's the issue. He disrespected your wishes, then wants to make it your fault. Is this a one off or a pattern of behaviour?", "There should be no question mark after \"I thought I said no.\" You say straight to his face \"I told you that I do not want a dog, and even if I did, we can not afford a dog.\" Give zero shits if it's in front of the neighbors, because he had no problem putting you in a corner in front of said neighbors. Stand up for yourself when he stomps all over your boundaries.\n\nNta, and I wonder what other boundaries he blatantly ignores. You sure you want a life with this guy?", "As in earlier in that day? Because if so I bet he definitely got the puppy already", "My money is on he already bought the puppy already and decided to go through with it.", "The fact that he deliberately engineered a situation where you would feel awkward declining his \"gift\" makes this even worse.", "Yeah, you need to dump this a-hole before the two of you scramble your dna.   More red flags here than in a Soviet May Day parade.", "I used to be terrified of dogs when I first got with my partner and he wouldn't have dreamt of getting me one because he knew it wouldn't work. Now I adore them and would love a surprise puppy, but only if we knew we could look after it and pay for everything that comes with it.", "Exactly!!!!", "Reddit expects everyone to divorce over everything... It doesn't always have to be so extreme. Lol geez.", "And so manipulative", "Honestly it sounds like y'all should talk about it! This is a dynamic where there would be enough people into the dog to take care of it, so you should sort out if those Nos are \"I don't want to take care of dog\" or \"having a dog would be emotionally traumatic for me\"", "We have fish, that was the compromise. My partner takes care of them, balances all the chemical levels of the tank, they do all the proverbial heavy lifting. I will help with feeding and water changes when they need help with them.\n\nMy partner is extremely thrilled with their fish.", "I was walking my dog and my elderly neighbour said, oh, she\u2019s so cute! What\u2019s her name?\nSophie, I said. \nDopey??? he asked. What an\u2026 unusual name! \nIt was said in such an amazingly judgmental tone. He was clearly very unimpressed with how I\u2019d named the poor dog.", "But actually....\n\nStupid dogs FTW. Smart dogs will learn what you want them to learn very quickly, but immediately begin thinking of loopholes. Stupid dogs take forever to learn things but then just remember them forever. I'll take having to show my dog to his food dish twice a day for 12 years over having to outsmart a bloody Mensa candidate every single day.", "He either follows some list of \"good things to do in a relationship\" where if OP disagrees with items on the list he thinks she's wrong, not the list, or he's a manipulator and not clueless but will pretend he is to further manipulate his target.", "Oh, I agree. Different dogs definitely have different needs and it's something people need to think about when adding one to their family. Too often people seem to just go on cuteness and maybe size, but for the latter it often seems to be what size of dog a potential owner wants instead of what size dog fits their lifestyle.", "Another comment mentions she's posting in the trying to conceive subreddit, so I'm sure he's already working on that too.", "Yup, this sort of thing is too close to baby trapping for my liking.", "Haha this made me laugh \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 also I agree", "That's the thing, there's so much that goes into owning a pet, dogs especially. My partner and our children have been trying to get me to say yes to a dog for almost 3 years now. But we live in an apartment, there's not much space, and we all work or go to school so the dog would be left alone most of the day.\n\nPlus, my boys desperately want a dog but have made it very clear they are unwilling to take responsibility for anything, and I don't need to be the one doing all the walking and such. \n\nIf you want a dog but you're not willing to take care of it, you don't really want a dog.", "A puppy should be like an engagement - a surprise is fine , but both parties should be onboard ahead of time. The surprise is the logistics part, everything else should be anticipated.", "We know why the no's are no's and we respect that. I personally believe that those no's will change with a little bit more time, but for now...", "Haha!", "Plus the look on the face of a slightly dappy dog. Always confused. Always adorable.", "Haha we must think alike because in my head the first thing that popped up was \"babies are cute too\" \n\nimagine next birthday..\" surprise those body changes you were talking about? Your preggers! I replaced your birth control with sugar tablets! I know you said you didn't want a baby but you will grow to love it! It's going to be the best thing ever! I'm so awesome.", "yeah, that's one of the reasons I (and some of my friends) don't have dogs. They're a lot of work.\n\nPlus I like being able to travel even if it's just visiting family and having a pet means needing someone to care for your pet. And it's either a big ask or a big expense.", "Yes! We had a very short discussion about having a dog. Nobody in the family wanted to take responsibility for its care, so no dog. We have four cats, but that's a whole nother story-I suck at fostering ha ha.", "If I wasn't allergic to cats it would be a lot hard to convince my family we can't have cats either lol"]}
