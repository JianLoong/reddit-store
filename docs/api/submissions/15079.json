This is not a gift. This is a chore. He put the bills and the work on you for him to have something to play with of he feels like it. \n\n\nYou told him no. This is very obviously a very swlfish thing to do.", "NTA.\n\n>he asked if I wanted a puppy, I said no, he got it anyway\n\nThere is something deeply wrong here. You are not the problem.", "Dogs are not gifts. They are commitments. And in most cases an over a decade one. He was completely irresponsible, immature and sly. It\u2019s unfair to you, but frankly in this situation the worse off is the dog. That pup is quickly learning about the world, fears and feelings. He\u2019s risking messing this pup up. Choosing a dog is a big deal to determine if your lifestyle suits that dog. It should be carefully considered one. Plus what does it say about his respect of you that he can make such a huge potential 15 year commitment on your behalf without asking and calling you the cruel one. NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is and questionable.", "NTA\n\nyou said no. whats the point of buying a gift someone doesnt want anyway? that makes no sense. can you gift chores too? lol.", "NTA - that doesn't sound like a present for you at all. And him calling you heartless for wanting the dog to have a loving home is a massive red flag. As is ignoring your direct wishes.\n\nIs this a pattern of behaviour? If so, are you sure you want to marry this man? It seems like you might be walking into a life of at best, ignoring your wants. At worst, gradually escalating abuse.", "Don't marry this man. Get out whilst you can.\n\nHe has no care for the dog. You on the other hand are clearly empathetic and sensible. You need to rehome the puppy asap. Then leave.", "NTA regardless of other reasoning, him asking and you saying no should have put an immediate stop to it. This would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA. He is manipulating you. He wanted the dog and went ahead and got it anyway. He probably hoped you'd fall in love and change your mind, but since you haven't you're now 'heartless' and 'mean'.\n\nYou're not heartless and mean. You set up clear boundaries and he ignored them. I'd seriously look at the rest of the relationship. If he's willing to try and manipulate you over this, he's more than capable of doing so in another area.", "NTA - I assume HE wanted a dog", "NTA, this is a very manipulative and irresponsible gift. He gave it to you, so it's your responsibility to look after it. He's putting you in the position of being \"heartless\" if you are ungrateful, yet owning a dog is a huge long-term responsibility, not something that you should take on without serious forethought. You don't say what kind of dog it is, and you don't know if it will be a suitable breed for an apartment/ a resident cat/ your lifestyle. \n\nA lot of people choose their pet dog based on how cute it is and how it will add to their Instagram feed; I believe strongly that you should figure out what kind of owner you would be so you can pick a dog that you can look after responsibly. Eg, I wouldn't be a good owner to a dog that needs a lot of grooming or a small yappy dog, but I am an excellent owner to a dog that needs to be walked twice a day on schedule. \n\nAlso it seems like your boyfriend wants the dog but not the responsibility, he wants the fun but not the serious conversation - so he has definitely sidestepped all the mature approaches by making this a \"gift\". When the dog is hard work or trouble, it will be your dog. You haven't had a chance to prepare or figure out how to work your current schedule around the dog's needs. \n\nI would suggest rehoming the dog as soon as possible so it has minimal disruption. You might need to rehome the boyfriend too if he has such little respect for your relationship as a partnership.", "NTA\n\nWhy do people still have to learn that PETS ARN'T GIFTS for crying out loud?  \nOnly, and really ONLY, if the person you are getting a pet for explicitly stated, that he/she want a pet AND you know what kind of pet AND you know the person is fine with the pet and can carry for it, it might be ok to gift a pet.", "Did anyone else read the title and think the dog was Mensa level smart?", "NTA\n\nAnimals are not a gift! Never. \n\nFurthermore you told him that you didn\u2018t want a puppy. He obviously doesn\u2018t respect your wishes and opinions. \n\nThis is a major red flag and a pour little soul will suffer because the puppy wants love and bonding and now they have to be rehomed and wait for love.\n\nAlso, don\u2018t let him pressure and guilt-trip you to keep the puppy that you do not want and that you cannot offer adequate space and financial stability.", "Yeah, no. Raising a puppy is a lot of work and exhausting even if you chose to get one, but being forced into becoming a pet parent against your express wishes and then being shamed for objecting is an AH move by your fianc\u00e9. Has he explained to you why he disrespected your wishes? Is it that HE wanted a puppy and thought you couldn\u2019t say \u201cNo\u201d if he gave you one as a gift? Is this the first time he\u2019s blatantly ignored your wishes? If I were you I would not let this one go and insist on getting to the bottom of his reasoning and his intentions.

Sounds like a bad move not only to you, but also to the puppy, because they dont get everything they deserve due to lack of money and love (not meant in a mean way, but i think animals are sensible and they might realize somehow when someone isnt fond of them that much.) Also maybe a bad move to the kitty because they might not get along.", "NTA, seems like he wanted a dog and 'gifted' one to you. You have all the right to not want a pet, he should have discussed it wit you and respected you, getting a dog is not a small decision.", "NTA. Is it possible, that your fian\u00e9 just wanted a dog but know you wouldn't like it. So he thaugh \"If i give it to her as a present, she has to like it\"? Animals should never be a gift unless the person gifted really know how to handle  the animal, is able to care for it and wants it. \n\nSorry, don't know any advices how to handle this kind of situation", "NTA. I agree with rehoming both the puppy and the boyfriend. He ignored your wishes and is manipulating your emotions to try to keep the puppy which is clearly a gift for him, not you.", "NTA. Clearly he wanted a puppy and got it as a \u201cgift\u201d for you when it was really for him.", "NTA. Sounds like he wanted a dog, and knowing you are not a dog person, the only way he could get away with it was to do it under the guise of a gift to you, knowing you would look bad if you refused it.", "You need to give it back! This is shameful behavior in his part. A. Not respecting YOU!and B. You will not lioe this dog that is needed, dogs have a keen sense that will know you don\u2019t love and care for him. This makes me furious! NTA!", "Y.t.a for making me think you were offered a gifted dog with talents because I was so excited to find out how exactly this dog was gifted (jk nta)", "NTA, it seems like a gift for himself, I mean you literally told him you didn't want one and got one anyway.", "NTA\n\nAnd based on what you wrote, you really need to re evaluate your releationship (setting a fact to something you are against and said no to).", "Nta.\nHe asked, you said no. That should have been it. As much as people love seeing posts of 'teehee he didn',t want the cat, now he loves it' it doesn't make it right. Pets are a commitment, and something you both should agree to", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not a dog person, and you told him \u201cno\u201d, so this gift is literally delusional. The kitten also has costs, and costs time. You aren\u2019t \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201cmean\u201d for being *logical*. I hate guilt tripping\u2026", "If your bf can make a unilateral decision so can you.\n\nRegift that \"gift\" to a rescue asap to give them the best chance of finding a new and loving forever home.\n\nTell bf that he can also be rehomed (but you need to mean it) unless you want your clear wishes, expectations and boundaries trampled on repeatedly in the future. This relationship looks doomed, but he may be able to learn from this. Can you?", "NTA.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e wanted a dog, got told no, bought one anyway, and then presented it as an unwanted gift. In other words: Your fianc\u00e9e bought a dog in spite of your disagreement. \n\nYou should have some stern words with your fianc\u00e9e about how joint decisions in a household work.\n\nAnd return the unwanted dog. If he complains then point out it is your dog.", "NTA First, animals aren't something to be gifted. Second, pets in a shared household are two yeses & one no. He asked & you said no. That's where it should have ended unless you changed your mind. \n\nThe fact that he ignored what you said & now is surprised Pikachu because you're not delighted by his \"gift\" is a red flag. Again, you said no & yet he still did what he wanted & is now trying to make you the bad guy for not going along with him steamrolling you into caring for a dog that is obvious that *he* wanted, but expects you to take care of. After all, why \"gift\" it to you when he knew you didn't want a dog?\n\nAnimals are a huge responsibility & you didn't agree nor sign up for this puppy. He's put both you & the puppy in a horrible position for being selfish & getting it knowing you weren't on board. \n\nI know it sounds cruel, but find a good home for the puppy that is happy to have it. Your bf did \"gift\" him to you after all, & you would be doing the responsible thing by making sure it's cared for the best way possible. \n\nAs for your bf, I'd wave a treat at the car door until he hopped in & then drive him to the nearest shelter (family/friends) & drop him off. But ultimately, that's your choice to make. Don't let him guilt you & please make sure the puppy isn't mistreated & finds a good & loving home.", "NTA. You don\u2019t gift people animals unless it is something you have discussed prior and have both agreed on. They are a big commitment.", "NTA\n\nHe bought this puppy for himself, not as a gift for you. But you need to make a decision on what to do with the puppy quickly, whether you keep him or speak to the breeder/shelter.", "NTA. You gave valid reasons why you didn't want a puppy. Your 3rd and 4th reasons are the most important.\n\nIf he wants a puppy for himself he should be honest about it and not getting one under this pretext.  \nHe is not respecting you or the dog itself. Find out where he got the dog from and return him. In case he paid for it, see if you can get a restitution and give him the money back.\n\nHe might call you spoiled, selfish and whatever for returning a gift. Remember this, you have told him you never wanted a dog. Stand your ground.   \nGetting a pet is a joint decision which needs 'yes' of both you and your fianc\u00e9 but only needs one 'No' to stop it.", "NTA. Absolutely a situation where you were consulted, gave your answer, and that should have been the end of it. \n\nWhat you were given is not a gift.

I wouldn\u2019t consider it a gift for you. That said your bf obviously really really wanted this dog, he has just gone about it in a ridiculous way so you couldn\u2019t refuse. Can you bring yourself to accept the dog? If not please make sure he goes to a good home.", "NTA you don\u2019t gift someone a 15 year day in and day out commitment.

Two yes, one no, when you're living with a partner. Because literally no matter what kind of pet it is, there is going to be *some* level of responsibility on both people to care for the animal. \n\nEven \"low-maintenance\" animals often aren't, not if they're being properly cared for. And even \"low-maintenance\" tasks can be draining when added to an already-full plate of someone who didn't want the damn animal in the first place. \n\nAnd a dog is one of the highest-maintenance animals you can get. It's basically a toddler. For 15 years. \n\nMy husband, before we were married, once brought home a pet I didn't want, and it was absolute torture for years. It was a very high-maintenance pet, and most of the maintenance fell to me because he traveled for work a lot at the time.

Not good enough for him?", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of idiot gives someone a living being as a gift when they are not 100% sure the recipient wants it? The kind of idiot that does want the animal, that's who.", "NTA- He got himself a puppy. He just wants to force you into accepting it. You're right, a puppy is a HUGE responsibility and honestly, could be dangerous to a young kitten.\n\nYou're not heartless. You're not the one who bought a living creature to force onto another person who already said they didn't want one.", "NTA - I see no evidence of gaslighting, but he definitely manipulated you", "NTA", "NTA you expressed your didn\u2019t wish to have a dog and he bought one anyways knowing it\u2019s a 10-15+ year commitment.  Sounds like HE wanted a dog and used you as an excuse to get one that he wouldn\u2019t have to take care of.", "NTA. Never ever gift a pet without it explicitly being wished and planned for. There's a reason shelters get full shortly after Christmas. The gifter just made the life of an innocent animal way harder and upset everybody involved. Textbook lose-lose situation.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 majorly sucks and I think it\u2019s terrible that now a poor puppy has to suffer and be rehomed because of him. You\u2019re not being heartless, he is.", "NTA. He wanted a dog, you didn't.\n\nHe wanted a way to get a dog in a way that you couldn't say no to without him twisting it to make you sound like the asshole. \n\nIt's manipulative.", "NTA  \nPlease re-home the puppy while it is still cute and more adoptable. (It's a gift. You can do what you wish with it)   \n\n\nConsider re-homing the fiance while you are at it.", "As a dog person..... NTA. A dog is a 15 year commitment requiring training, time, daily walks, enrichment ect. No one should be making a 15 year decision that affects both parties in a relationship. He asked if you wanted a dog, you said no, he got it anyway. Your boyfriend is a dick who doesn't listen and does what HE wants. You need to decide what you want", "There is something I got from another thread that I believe in wholeheartedly, the discussion to get a pet requires two yeses or one no.", "Responsibilities shouldn't be given as gifts", "Couldn't have said it better myself! Completely agree", "Even worse, he did ask. She said no and he did it anyway! So selfish.", "Agreed. But am I the only one that read \u201cgifted \u201cas the dog being some sort of genius, prodigy puppy?", "NTA obvs.", "Wow, get out of a relationship because he gave the girl a puppy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 that's a bit extreme tbh. There's other ways to handle what has happened and breaking up over it is very childish \ud83d\ude02\nNTA though.\n\nETA: my verdict.", "Not only is he the one who wants the dog but I suspect he doesn\u2019t want to have to also care for the dog so he \u2018gifts\u2019 it and now can say \u201cwell I\u2019m not feeding/walking/cleaning up after dog, it\u2019s not mine!\u201d", "Or you get a gift card for a pet and when/if they buy one you are the one who pays", "The only time it is acceptable to give a pet as a gift is if the person asks for it. Like several years ago I fell in love with a dog at our local rescue and my husband made arrangements behind my back for them to bring him over as a foster to adopt (within 24 hrs it was an unanimous yes from the whole family). \n\nI wanted that specific dog though and if he had shown up with another I may have fallen in love with it eventually, but may have been peeved at the same time and decided that it wasn't a fit for me/our family (like saying I want a Great Dane as they're big mellow cuddly couch potatoes, then being gifted a Malinois that requires 20 hrs of work a day so they don't tear up your house in boredom).", "you are not alone, lol", "Definitly not alone, lol", "Same \ud83d\ude05", "I thought the same thing and was so confused \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you!", "Only dopey dogs for me thank you very much!", "Me too. I couldn't figure out why the hell someone wouldn't want a super smart dog until I read the post.\n\nNta by the way, find a friend or co-worker that is looking for a free puppy and don't quickly so the poor thing isn't in limbo too long", "He didn\u2019t just \u201cgive the girl a puppy\u201d. He deliberately went against her wishes and is trying to gaslight her into taking on a responsibility that will last a decade of her life, one that she never wanted in the first place, and one they can\u2019t afford to take care of responsibly. I would leave my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ass for trying to force something like that on me. Things like pets and children are a two-party consent in a relationship. Both people have to want it. If one person says no, then that\u2019s final.", "It\u2019s not about the gift, it\u2019s about breaking a very important -and already discussed- boundary and about disrespecting his partner\u2019s opinion. Plus a puppy\u2019s life dragged into it.", "well this shows he doesn't consider her feelings. She said no to the financial and time consuming burden of a living, breathing animal. Not to mention they already have a kitty that needs to be taken care of. She didn't want the dog and made that clear, and he did not listen at all and did the opposite. massive red flag.", "She says she told him no and then he showed up with a puppy anyway as a \"gift\" for her. A \"gift\" she said she didn't want. He bought himself a dog and then gave it to her so she could have the responsibility. It's much more than just \"he gave her a puppy\"", "That's like saying that someone is wrong for [leaving over dishes](https://matthewfray.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/). It's not about the dishes. It's not about the dog. It's about the behavior.\n\nHe actively disrespected her by disregarding her feelings and wishes, and now he's guilt tripping her because she's (rightfully) upset. It's not childish to leave someone who doesn't treat you as well as you deserve.", "That is horridly manipulative. He\u2019s like a spoiled child. I would be incredibly firm on returning puppy to where it came from."]}
