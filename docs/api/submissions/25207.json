She needs to know other people do parent their children.", "NTA- Clearly, she\u2019s not taught her kids a restaurant isn\u2019t a playground. It\u2019s possible to teach young children that running around and taking things off other tables is unacceptable. It takes work and a lot of parents are too lazy to put the time in. If you let your kids act that way, expect the people around you to take note and possibly comment.", "NTA - Not all kids are the same, especially in public.

Not your best moment, but nothing wrong with the truth.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, personally i\u2019m a firm believer in we SHOULD call out more entitled parents like this. Doing it holds them accountable for their crap.\nYou did the right thing Op", "NTA. I've got 5 kids 8 and under and they all know how to behave as well. It just requires parenting.", "NTA If they left that quickly, maybe you should employ this tactic whenever the need arises.", "NTA.    The child touched the bread and the mom tells them to put it back. What would you do with that nasty bread? the kid should have kept it.\n\nThe comment wasn't nice but it was deserved.  There is a saying, sometimes the trash takes itself out.

I mean I wouldnt have said this myself but I'm not going to judge you an AH just because you have the courage to say what I would probably be thinking at that time. \n\nI have a 12 years old. He is not perfect neither I am. But he would have never do anything remotely similar to that, or run and scream inside a restaurant. \n\nHer reaction explains everything;  in the remote case he did, I would be giving apologies instead of excuses.", "NTA.

Me, my husband and our two kids were out at a restaurant recently and this couple sitting near us allowed their young twin boys to run and scream (really loud and high pitched too,) all over the restaurant. The parents sat and chatted as if they couldn\u2019t hear any of it. Thank god they were finishing up their meal as I was close to saying something as well. Maybe this isn\u2019t a factor but the parents looked like the young and rich type who\u2019ve never been told no themselves. My kids are by no means angels but they looked at those young boys as if they were aliens. When my kids were toddlers they were taught to behave in restaurants and public spaces.  For us and people like us, going out for dinner these days is a luxury and I always assume people would like to enjoy their meal that they are paying for.", "NTA, I can't stand people who let their kids cause chaos in public spaces. You definitely weren't polite but hey I'm kinda petty and think she deserved the comment. \ud83d\ude02", "ESH. You literally admit to being impolite. Usually that\u2019s an AH move. Shes also TA for not handling her children and then yelling at you.

She\u2019s trying to excuse her lack of parenting by saying \u2018kids will be kids\u2019 as if they can\u2019t learn when to play and run around and when not to. There may be the occasional mess up or kid getting overwhelmed, but most kids know to sit at their table and not take food from other people\u2019s tables in a restaurant. You answered honestly and you weren\u2019t super rude about it or anything. Honestly the fact that it just popped out of your mouth is hilarious to me.", "I 100% agree. It reminds me of parents who tell stories of their way too old kids throwing tantrums then blow it off by saying something such as \u201clike all kids do\u201d. Wrong. My oldest never did cause when she was about 3 we were in Walmart and some little kid was throwing a tantrum she asked what was wrong with that kid. I explained what he was doing and told her if she did it she\u2019d be in very big trouble. She never did. My youngest tried once, we ignored her till she was done. She never did it again. \n\nNTA", "Yup. It makes them think twice before taking their children out when they aren\u2019t prepared to parent publicly.", "Maybe being raped to death for bad parenting is a little bit...

One of the public\u2019s pet hates (on multiple forums) is parents who let their children run wild and affect others in restaurants and other public spaces that are not playgrounds. \n\nOP, telling one lax parent at a time!", "So only 1 of your children was of a similar age? Look they should control their children more but still in my opinion an AH comment"]}
