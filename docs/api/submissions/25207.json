It\u2019s possible to teach young children that running around and taking things off other tables is unacceptable. It takes work and a lot of parents are too lazy to put the time in.

Me, my husband and our two kids were out at a restaurant recently and this couple sitting near us allowed their young twin boys to run and scream (really loud and high pitched too,) all over the restaurant. The parents sat and chatted as if they couldn\u2019t hear any of it. Thank god they were finishing up their meal as I was close to saying something as well. Maybe this isn\u2019t a factor but the parents looked like the young and rich type who\u2019ve never been told no themselves. My kids are by no means angels but they looked at those young boys as if they were aliens. When my kids were toddlers they were taught to behave in restaurants and public spaces.  For us and people like us, going out for dinner these days is a luxury and I always assume people would like to enjoy their meal that they are paying for.", "NTA, I can't stand people who let their kids cause chaos in public spaces. You definitely weren't polite but hey I'm kinda petty and think she deserved the comment. \ud83d\ude02", "ESH. You literally admit to being impolite. Usually that\u2019s an AH move.

She\u2019s trying to excuse her lack of parenting by saying \u2018kids will be kids\u2019 as if they can\u2019t learn when to play and run around and when not to. There may be the occasional mess up or kid getting overwhelmed, but most kids know to sit at their table and not take food from other people\u2019s tables in a restaurant. You answered honestly and you weren\u2019t super rude about it or anything. Honestly the fact that it just popped out of your mouth is hilarious to me.", "I 100% agree. It reminds me of parents who tell stories of their way too old kids throwing tantrums then blow it off by saying something such as \u201clike all kids do\u201d. Wrong. My oldest never did cause when she was about 3 we were in Walmart and some little kid was throwing a tantrum she asked what was wrong with that kid. I explained what he was doing and told her if she did it she\u2019d be in very big trouble. She never did. My youngest tried once, we ignored her till she was done. She never did it again. \n\nNTA", "Yup. It makes them think twice before taking their children out when they aren\u2019t prepared to parent publicly.", "Maybe being raped to death for bad parenting is a little bit... Extreme?", "To provide a little more info, my kids are m23, m15, f13, f6.\nBut even when the three oldest where under 10, they didn't behave like that.", "Needed to be said. One of the public\u2019s pet hates (on multiple forums) is parents who let their children run wild and affect others in restaurants and other public spaces that are not playgrounds. \n\nOP, telling one lax parent at a time!", "So only 1 of your children was of a similar age? Look they should control their children more but still in my opinion an AH comment", "OP NTA. I would not have been as nice as you. I don't have children and I don't tolerate that kind of behavior. If I'm at a restaurant that serves bread, and some random kid came to my table and took a roll from the basket on my table, I'd be smacking that kid's hand, saying \"This isn't your bread or your table.\" Then I'd be taking that kid back to his/her own table and telling the parents to discipline their child so I don't have to again.", "The fact that she yelled at you after the comment explains why her kids are the way they are", "NTA because it's the truth but the truth is also that some kids are just gonna misbehave even if the parents are great.\n\nMy younger brother has been disciplined for hitting his teacher and he's still done it more than once anyway. Some kids rly just don't care", "I don't think you were the asshole, but I get where your wife is coming from.\n\nYou can't tell me that during all those years, there wasn't a single time when your kids misbehaved in public. They do that. They get out of hand. You can't control them every second of every day. Sometimes they run around. Sometimes parents are overwhelmed. You don't accomplish anything by pointing out your well-behaved kids to a parent who is having a bad day with theirs. \n\nIf I were you, I'd let the child have the piece of bread and talk to them. It tones down the tension, takes pressure of the parents and I doubt you're going to miss a piece of bread. Everyone gets a more favorable outcome. Nothing is achieved by saying what you did. \n\nYou didn't go out of your way to say it, it was a spur of the moment banter kind of thing, so NTA. But it could have gone better.", "You defended your kids, as you should. NTA!", "I mean it was definitely a snarky and impolite comment. However, i love it and think that mother needed to hear it. People that allow their children to run around a restaurant and disturb others honestly deserve crasser words.", "NTA. You simply spoke the truth.", "NTA.  I have well behaved kids that I busted (and still bust) my hump to raise, and I see people like this woman all the time.  They're lazy parents.  End of.", "NTA. This made me cackle. That's something I'd say lol.", "NTA\n\nIf you had agreed with the other parent, what message would you have been sending to YOUR kids?  You and your wife have obviously done a good job raising your kids to be well mannered and respectful, and you should NOT confuse them (especially the 6 y/o) by sending mixed messages.  You did and said exactly what you needed to, and you set the appropriate example in front of your children.  And it may be a good message for the other kids to hear, even if it alone wasn't life changing for them.", "NTA some parents need to hear that shit", "NTA, said the same thing to my aunt!", "NTA - Some parents need the reality check that they are not parenting", "NTA. I\u2019ve got two kids. They\u2019ve never behaved like this in a restaurant. \n\nShe can be as pissy as she wants.  That\u2019s her problem.", "Took a piece of bread?!? Lmao.  The mom asked for that comment!  She should have just apologized and left it at that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI think that was a perfectly reasonable response. Well said!", "NTA. I would have melted into the ground and died of embarrassment  if my kid ran around a restaurant and touched people\u2019s food at any age let alone 6-10. She needed to hear it.", "NTA You did the right thing. I was in the grocery store once and there was a boy in the basket who was about 4, so not a toddler, and he was screaming the whole time. Not crying, just screaming for no reason and his mother did nothing to stop him, just kept shopping in all the aisles. One of the employees actually covered his ears because the kid was so loud. \n\nThey were in the self checkout counter in front of me and I looked at him and said \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? The whole store could hear you.\u201d He shut up fast and his mother still said nothing to me or him, finished checking out and left. It\u2019s not that hard to control a child. And by me addressing the boy and not his mother, I wasn\u2019t confronting her about her parenting so she didn\u2019t get defensive. But her lack of any action was very disturbing.", "NTA \nWho just lets their kids not only run around but steal food off of peoples tables. \nIf my kid even attempted to leave the table for something that wasn\u2019t the bathroom, we\u2019d be going to the car to have a conversation! The absolute disrespect that parent has for those around them. \nLook kids will be kids, in that they have a hard time sitting still, but you teach them how to behave. We always order our kids food first, or an appetizer we all like to help keep them occupied or some games that aren\u2019t loud to play at the table. They\u2019re also old enough to have a conversation so we talk and keep them happy while we all wait. What they are not allowed to do is run amok and do whatever pleases them!", "i had to behave when i was young and went out to dinner. my brother behaved when we went out as well.  a phrase that i really hate is \u201c he / she is just a kid \u201c\nso ?  a kid who needs to be taught some manners", "NTA - I think your comment was spot on.  My kids have *never* run around a restaurant like that, and certainly would never have grabbed something off someone else's table.", "NTA: \u201cKids will be kids\u201d is used for things like if a kid laughs to loud or is a bit uncoordinated. A 6 year old should know better than to grab other\u2019s food.", "NTA\nSometimes, the truth hurts, but it needs to be said.", "NTA and I absolutely love what you said!", "10 minutes later they were out the door? I hope everyone else in the restaurant thanked you. Well done!", "Nta.  Mine also well behaved so i get you.", "NTA. \nThere\u2019s a time and place for that type of behavior. A public restaurant is not that place. Hope that was a reality check for her.", "NTA. Totally justified comment. The fact that she proceeded to yell at you in the middle of a restaurant just proves your point.", "NTA - idk which stole the bread but if it was the youngest and they were around 6 they are old enough to be taught you don\u2019t steal bread from strangers in a restaurant. That mom can just use \u201ckids, eh\u201d as an excuse for bad behavior.", "NTA - Thank you for having well behaved children. I wish more people made this kind of effort to ensure their children don\u2019t treat restaurants like a personal playground.", "NTA; apparently it\u2019s universal to think the world should tolerate your  misbehaving children.", "NTA, you did well to shame her", "NTA. She has the mentality of \u201ckids will be kids\u201d which is horrible for a parent because it basically means that she doesn\u2019t care to actually parent her children to prep them for adulthood. Habits you have as a child never go away and I think she needs to learn that.", "Nta\nParents need to step up", "NTA, but even if you had been sh\\*\\*t like that would have completely deserved it. You were extremely polite in my opinion.", "Grabbing food off another\u2019s table??? Honey come get your children jesus", "My dog, all 14.5 years old of her, would be begging and pulling out all the eyes and paws stomping to get food. But she would NOT get on the table or chairs to do that. She would just hope her cute begging self would get treats. LOL.", "Old school", "We all just went through three years of COVID killing millions and she\u2019s not only letting her kids run around and grab other people\u2019s food, SHE TOLD THEM TO PUT IT BACK. WTF.", "That's the part that hit me, too. That is just gross. Ewww", "the only people who would find fault with ops comment, are the ones worried their own kids behave like that ladies."]}
