Me, my husband and our two kids were out at a restaurant recently and this couple sitting near us allowed their young twin boys to run and scream (really loud and high pitched too,) all over the restaurant. The parents sat and chatted as if they couldn\u2019t hear any of it. Thank god they were finishing up their meal as I was close to saying something as well. Maybe this isn\u2019t a factor but the parents looked like the young and rich type who\u2019ve never been told no themselves. My kids are by no means angels but they looked at those young boys as if they were aliens. When my kids were toddlers they were taught to behave in restaurants and public spaces.  For us and people like us, going out for dinner these days is a luxury and I always assume people would like to enjoy their meal that they are paying for.", "NTA, I can't stand people who let their kids cause chaos in public spaces.

They do that. They get out of hand. You can't control them every second of every day. Sometimes they run around. Sometimes parents are overwhelmed. You don't accomplish anything by pointing out your well-behaved kids to a parent who is having a bad day with theirs. \n\nIf I were you, I'd let the child have the piece of bread and talk to them. It tones down the tension, takes pressure of the parents and I doubt you're going to miss a piece of bread. Everyone gets a more favorable outcome.

You and your wife have obviously done a good job raising your kids to be well mannered and respectful, and you should NOT confuse them (especially the 6 y/o) by sending mixed messages.  You did and said exactly what you needed to, and you set the appropriate example in front of your children.

Not crying, just screaming for no reason and his mother did nothing to stop him, just kept shopping in all the aisles.

The whole store could hear you.\u201d He shut up fast and his mother still said nothing to me or him, finished checking out and left. It\u2019s not that hard to control a child.

The absolute disrespect that parent has for those around them. \nLook kids will be kids, in that they have a hard time sitting still, but you teach them how to behave. We always order our kids food first, or an appetizer we all like to help keep them occupied or some games that aren\u2019t loud to play at the table.

The fact that she proceeded to yell at you in the middle of a restaurant just proves your point.", "NTA - idk which stole the bread but if it was the youngest and they were around 6 they are old enough to be taught you don\u2019t steal bread from strangers in a restaurant. That mom can just use \u201ckids, eh\u201d as an excuse for bad behavior.", "NTA - Thank you for having well behaved children.

She has the mentality of \u201ckids will be kids\u201d which is horrible for a parent because it basically means that she doesn\u2019t care to actually parent her children to prep them for adulthood.

My nephew is a wonderful, wonderful child and is so well behaved, but very rarely he throws an insane tantrum. Because he is a child. Because even you adults have bad moments (if you didn\u2019t this sub wouldn\u2019t exist). You have no idea if the kids are like this all the time, or were just having a particularly bad day of misbehaving. You are an adult. You should be able to deal with minor inconveniences in life like an annoying child. You probably shouldn\u2019t leave the house if you can\u2019t.

Police were involved because she was so drunk and thought she'd get in the car and try and drive off with the kid too. \n\nIt. Was. A. Mess! \n\nThe restaurant/bar felt so bad that they paid for the meal and also gave us a take out order on them.

I get it sometimes kids can't sit still in a restaurant but when that's the case I pay for my food and leave. There have been many instances where u had to take my food to go because my kids couldn't handle being in a restaurant. Like if they can't sit still, I'm not even enjoying my meal, so why stay. \n\nI have realized that kids remember the times where you leave, and they learn that the bad behavior isn't tolerated.

Good for you.", "NTA don\u2019t insult my kids or my parenting.", "Brag about your kids. My son never behaved that way. It was an asshole thing to say.

That way, you could have asserted your boundaries in a way that wasn't smug or patronising - you haven't walked in her shoes. \n\nKids behave differently for a number of reasons. Sometimes it's disability. Sometimes trauma. And yes, sometimes just poor parenting or \"naughty\" kids.
