Her loving family was at a loss at how to deal with her, so she was pretty much allowed to be feral and during meals she ran around the room and scavenged from everyone's plates.\n\nAnnie Sullivan herself was almost legally blind, and was rescued from a poorhouse and sent to a school for blind children, where she was educated. Then she was sent to be Helen Keller's teacher. One of the first things she taught her was to sit at a table, use a napkin and a fork, and eat off her own plate.  A huge battle of wills ensued.\n\nEventually Annie Sullivan convinced Helen's parents to let her take the child to a nearby cottage (they drove around first enough to confuse Helen so she thought they were far from her home) so they could have one on one work, and that's when the famous breakthrough happened when Annie spelled \"W-A-T-E-R\" into Helen's hand while it was under rushing water from a pump, and the child understood that one thing stood for another.\n\nKeller rapidly learned how to sign, to understand signs, and to read braille and write, and became a highly educated woman, supported throughout Sullivan's life as her Teacher.\n\nExcellent books by and about Annie Sullivan and Helen Keller herself, as well as a pretty terrific movie \"The Miracle Worker\" starring Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. Here's a relevant clip from the movie, the dining room scene starts at about one minute in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbO3W18ndZY", "Oh wow, thanks for posting that Travelgrrl. I just watched the eating lesson scene, intense. I\u2019m off down a Keller/Sullivan rabbit hole. Bye!", "NTA! Children are HUMANS and \"they're all the same\" is so fucking rude?? Like, take responsibility for your actions as a parent, lady. But don't sit there and OPENLY insult other people to make yourself feel better.", "NTA I don't care much for kids and those kids are why.  Well behaved ones are the only ones I can be around without becoming really pissed off very quickly.  But I really appreciate the well behaved ones because they seem to be very rare.", "the amount of N-T-A verdicts are astounding. \n\nwhat happened was barely a mild inconvenience and OP has no context of what the children are like or what caused them to behave that way on that day. \n\nWhatever happened to kindness? Just say it\u2019s okay and move on. No need to kick another parent when they\u2019re down and clearly embarrassed by their children\u2019s behavior. YTA", "6 to 10 is old enough to know to stay put at the restaurant. If she wants to have a place where they can run around then she needs to go to a restaurant with a designated outdoor/indoor play area.\n\nEdit: NTA I will say what you said would definitely come across as rude to most people but you were only speaking the truth.", "Nta.  Tell her to control them", "\nNTA. Period.", "NTA\n\nShe brushed off like it's normal to do that and the only consequence the child faced was a \"put it back\"", "NTA\n\nShe clearly wasn\u2019t going to do anything if didn\u2019t think her kids misbehaving was a problem and was making excuses for them. Her lax parenting disrupted everyone else\u2019s dinner.", "ROFL!  You, sir, are awesome!!!!", "NTA.... I didn't spend all that time teaching my kids how to be well behaved, respectful and polite for someone else to say that's how kids are to excuse their own less than stellar lazy parenting.\n\nNo. That's not how they are. They are how you teach them to be.\n\nMy children are not entitled assholes. We are not the same.", "NTA. Forget polite. You were honest. The woman had no control over her brats and got pissed because you called her on it. If she didn't want to be told what a bad mother she is then she should get her kids under control.", "NTA You pissed her off because you made her see her own lack of parenting.  Good for you!", "NTA.  the kid should have been stopped before getting to your table. \n\nIt is true that some kids are less manageable due to hyperactivity or natural personality.  I've met some great parents with crazy children.  However, misbehavior can be mitigated in public spaces.  The proper response of that parent in particular, if the child's actions were unpreventable, would have been an apology, if not an apology from the child. \n\nWhat that mother did was brush you off, in essence excusing her child's behavior and shifting the blame to ALL children. (Including yours, which is probably why you reacted defensively.) If the parents don't display remorse for a certain type of behavior, how is the child supposed to learn to do the same, now and as an adult? \n\n(Early Childhood Educator 15+ years)", "NTA. She\u2019s just jealous that you\u2019re better parents \ud83e\udee2", "NTA. Parents need to learn to parent. A restaurant is not a playground. You were spot on.", "NTA.  Dude.  Kids running around in restaurants is kind of common, but I have never seen a kid take food off of someone else's table.", "NTA - running around like wild animals in a restaurant is one thing, taking food off the table of another family is waaaay over the line! Your children WERE behaving, you were just speaking facts.", "NTA - Parents who don\u2019t have well behave chide don\u2019t like it when people point it out.\n\nThe kids shouldn\u2019t be running around a restaurant and they certainly shouldn\u2019t touch other people\u2019s food. And put it back, WTF?!?! No lady, you kid can now keep it and you\u2019re buying a new one to replace it!", "NTA. Kids that age should know not to steal from other people and can behave at a restaurant.", "NTA. My kids never just took stranger people's food from a plate in public places. Such behavior can be excused for a toddler, but definitely not for 6-10  y olds.", "I certainly don't think it was a helpful comment. Kids can be little shits at the end of the day (mine included) no matter how much discipline you give, they have a mind of their own and can be impulsive and reckless, all toddlers are different. Some are obedient and listen to their parents, others not so much. I'd of just simply said keep the bread and ordered more (assuming it was free) and left it at that. Just a needless, boastful thing to say to a mum who was probably mortified already.", "NTA. Truth hurts seemingly, but you are still not an AH for pointing out that fact. The parents should improve the raising of their children.", "That's actually the nicest thing you could have said, and it needed to be said.", "I have always firmly believed that entitled parents should be responsible for their children's behavior.", "It's definitely true that all kids will misbehave sometimes, but the mom's reaction seems very nonchalant. If she was embarrassed surely her first instinct should at least be to apologize to the people that were bothered? The way she reacted made it seem like 'eh, what can you do, they'll be like this anyway' which is not very promising for her parenting style. I know if I ever grabbed something from someone else's table my parents would be apologizing profusely, not making light of the incident.", "That was exactly my reaction!", "My sister would have screaming lying on the floor tantrums.  It usually got her what she wanted with my mom.  She tried it with my grandmother and Gran just completely ignored her.  Tried maybe 2 or 3 times and never bothered doing it again with Gran, but continued doing it with Mom.  It was definitely manipulative and she clearly could control it.\n\nFYI this was at home and in public.  Often at a store because she wanted candy or something.  Gran just ignored her, carried on checking out, and walked away.  I'm sure other people weren't happy listening to it but in the long run Gran never had to hear it again.  I was older and I told my mom to do the same thing but she never would, she'd just buy the chocolate bar or whatever sis was screaming for.", "Well I don\u2019t have kids so", "My almost 3 year old child  has an invisible disability- autism and most likely ADHD.  To some people,  he looks like a brat who wont listen. He is in Early Intervention and all the therapists  have a hard time redirecting him. He is  highly impulsive, and very hard to redirect- that is part of the reason why he was diagnosed with autism so young.\n\nI used to be so annoyed with bratty kids, but now that I have a kid with an invisible disability, I try to give others some grace. Maybe its bad parenting, maybe  the kids have a disability, maybe the kids are just having a bad day. You are very lucky that your kids don't tantrum.", "YTA!\n\nCertainly whilst your kids may be well behaved, are they enjoying themselves? My 2 sons are generally well behaved based on comments from other people but behind closed doors, they can be total shitbags, but they're kids, moreover, they're young boys, they get into everything and climb over any obstacle. In a restaurant sure they won't run about or steal bread from other places but your comment was rude and unwarranted. You could have just nodded and did a polite laugh like most people would have.", "You kind of started a fight with that comment. But she did kind of provoke that response, and did decide to escalate again afterwards.\n\nSo if fighting over parenting is considered a-hole behavior, then E S H.", "NTA. Kids running around can have hot coffee spilt on them or be tripped over by unaware diners. They can be responsible for adults bumping into them, falling over them and flattening them. The hazards these kids face. The woman who let them run around does not care about her children at all, just wants an easy life.", "NTA you only spoke the truth and I'm sorry but she should keep control over her kids. My kids have never done that and I would be absolutely furious if a random kid ran up and took anything from the table especially if her only response was to shout across the restaurant. Get off your ass and make your child sit down! Explain to them it's not acceptable to do these things, not just excuse the behavior because they're \"just kids\", they need to learn how to behave in these situations.", "NTA.  She just couldn\u2019t handle the truth.", "NTA.", "NTA- People don't mind children in restaurants if they sit at the table and don't make a ton of noise. People object to badly behaved kids in restaurants. People like this woman need it pointing out that the disruption is not acceptable and it is possible to avoid it if you parent correctly.", "NTA. Her comment about her kids and then her yelling at you until she was kicked out are clear signs of how she parents them.", "NTA\n\nWouldnt say you were an asshole but that comment was certainly unnecessary and you could have just not say that. Kind of a dick comment, but it was 100% justified so youre not the asshole nor in the wrong here. Dont get me wrong, youre not in the right as well. Was not very nice of you to say.", "NTA, 6-10 and they're running around and stealing food. Wtf. That mother does not know how to dicipline her kids, ans then the audacity to say \"kids eh?\" like no, lady *your kids*, eh.", "NTA \n\nLemme guess you German ?", "ESH  Most of us think that inside but we don\u2019t say it. The Mum stopped the kid and tried to diffuse the situation because she was embarrassed. There was no need to further shame her. It\u2019s not like she sat there and allowed her to kid to keep going. Don\u2019t be unkind.", "NTA, It was also fucking hilarious. Somebody needed to call her out on that shit and you stepped up. You're a gods damned hero.", "NTA, by saying that, she basically said that your kids misbehave like that as well, even though they weren't. Kids aren't \"all the same\". She just needs to step up as a parent and parent then.", "NTA kids running around are one thing \"a kids will be kids \" there could cover things like ADHD aka they are too full of energy and could possibly be ignored.\n\nAs soon as the child touched your bread then they crossed the line and needed the food taken off the child, an apology and probably an offer to replace the dish. Rather than a \"What can I do\".", "You stated a fact \ud83d\ude02 NTA.", "Going against the grain, but ESH. Yes, \"kids will be kids\" is stupid, but the mom did make the kid take the bread back, that's enough. No need to make quirky comments, just say thanks and move on. This subreddit is filled with angry teens.", "NTA.\nThis made me laugh, all you did was state the truth.", "And it gives us, who actually give a damn about raising polite children, a bad name. All those childhaters? They dont even notice all those sweet, well mannered kids, because the hellions whose parents couldnt care less are so damn loud and obnoxious.", "Every parent has had moments of embarrassment in public. \n\nBut there's a difference between an ill timed tantrum at the grocery store and straight up letting your kids run wild at a restaurant. \n\nOne is something you simply have to deal with while parenting young children, the other is parents not caring."]}
