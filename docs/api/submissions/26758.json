Therapy and grounding sounds like the way to do it.", "NTA, grief and shoplifting are completely different things, your partner is enabling her because her bf died.\n\nSure it sucks and she needs time to process it, but stealing isnt included in that... ever", "Info how did you ground her? Cause it really depends here. It might really not be productive. Imagine being her and having your boyfriend die and then doing something stupid and now you are grieveing and for example you can't see your friends for a month. Well you just made it worse after thatz", "As someone who lived thru a very similar situation,  buckle up. Between the grief and the hormones,  its a tough deal. She needs to see a grief counselor. Thats not optional.  There needs to ve consequences for her actions but she really needs compassion from her parental figures.  Its a crazy tough time.", "NTA:  If you didn't punish her you're showing her that she will get away with trouble if something bad in her life is going on.  That is not a precedent you want to set. \n\nKudos for recommending therapy as well", "I think therapy would be a big word for now.. If she is severely grief stricken then definitely take your daughter to a professional. \nYou are her parents, why don't you talk to your daughter? Shes going through a terrible phase at such a young age and instead of just hugging and teaching her a moral lesson, you are grounding her.", "INFO: What does grounding entail? Does it result in her being cut-off from her friends (a support network) at a time that she's struggling? Do the restrictions get in the way of her grieving and healing, or are they designed in a way that's compatible with her getting the support she needs? If the former, is there an alternative way to to get across that she did something wrong while offering a little more leeway for a first offence?\n\nNot about right or wrong. It's just got to be about what works to help your daughter.", "Yta. Seems like you're an incel who's angry that his daughter dated a Chad and thats why you can't offer her any support in grieving, passing it off on a therapist. Also, negative reinforcement doesn't work to change behavior, connection does. Shoplifting is a sign that she feels alienated.", "NTA, grief does not allow you to go around stealing things. Condoning this will only lead to harder and harder acts of acting out. Nip it in the bud, there are healthy ways to process and unhealthy this is an unhealthy response to grief.", "NTA", "NTA : whilst this is a clear cry for help (I lost my best friend and her dad when I was 17 and spiralled), she needs boundaries and punishments still. Or else she will learn that she can use the grief to act out and use it as excuses for her behaviour. You did right\u2026but therapy is the most important thing. And sometimes it takes a few therapists until you find the right one. Support is what she needs right now. Not a \u201cbad cop\u201d all the time. Wishing you both all the best.", "ESH\n\nWhen your daughter was caught shoplifting, arrested, and taken to the Sheriff\u2019s department, that was punishment for her actions. Being caught was likely terrifying, and being arrested was likely humiliating. If, in your opinion, that is not sufficient, I urge you to dole out a punishment that reinforces the lesson you are trying to teach. \u201cStealing is wrong/illegal\u201d is a lesson that she has already been taught with her arrest. Perhaps you would like to teach her \u201cyou must work to afford the things you want.\u201d In that case, give her tasks around the house that equate to the value of the items she stole. Maybe the lesson is \u201cstealing impacts others beyond you.\u201d In that case, have her research and write a report explaining how her actions affected others. Or maybe you would like to teach her that \u201cshoplifting can severely impact your adult life negatively, and you\u2019re lucky you were still a minor in this case.\u201d Again, she could research and write a report about the legal ramifications of shoplifting if she was an adult. If this was a first offense petty theft (under $100 I assume) she would not go to jail even if she was an adult. She would receive a non-traffic class c misdemeanor. I\u2019m not sure grounding her is reinforcing the lesson you want to teach, but I don\u2019t know what lesson you want to teach.\n\nHer mother cannot use yall\u2019s daughter\u2019s grief to excuse this behavior. If your daughter were an adult, she would still face punishment from the legal system regardless of her personal circumstances. The lesson your wife is attempting to teach your daughter is that personal circumstances trump repercussions. Perhaps your wife believes your daughter was sufficiently punished with her arrest, but that is not what she said. She said grief should shield your daughter from consequences, and that is what your daughter may absorb. \n\nIt is up to you and your wife to determine if the arrest was sufficient punishment. Either way, you should both explain to your daughter that her grief does not/will not shield her from repercussions especially once she is an adult. You can then tell your daughter that the two of you have decided the arrest was sufficient punishment, or explain what her further punishment will be and what lesson you are teaching with said punishment.\n\nAlso, yes, your daughter does need therapy for her grief. I\u2019m glad you pointed that out, and I hope you seek out a therapist beyond what the school can offer bc frankly those counselors are not able to provide for your daughter adequately.", "NTA\n\nGrieving does not excuse someone for their actions. Shoplifting is absolutely a good reason to ground someone and teaches the lesson that you don\u2019t usually get a pass when you do something shitty while going through a hard time. If you didn\u2019t ground her and she repeats the offense, the law won\u2019t go easy on her a second time.", "NAH. \n\nI see both sides of this.  And I don't know that there is a \"right\" answer. \n\nI would say in general, I agree with you.   You don't get to just have no consequences because you are going through something.  \n\nWhen people die, life has to go on.  If she was working, she doesn't get to just no show and not get punishment. \n\nThat said, your wife makes a valid point too.  She is dealing with teenage angst and hormones, which causes them to act out anyway, and now you throw grief on top of it.  \n\nAfter a month?  Its really hard to say.  \n\nMaybe this is a conversation you have with a therapist, because i can easily see an argument either way.", "NTA - It sucks what your daughter is going through but that doesn't give her a free pass to do whatever she wants. Shoplifting is pretty bad and she needs to be punished for it. She also needs to realise that people don't just get to do what they want when they're sad, a lot of people have bad shit going on in their lives and if they commit a crime they still get in trouble.", "NTA as long as the grounding isn't excessive. Get her real therapy.", "NTA. I hurt for your daughter, but she needs to learn to handle her emotions productively, not destructively. You are exactly right- she needs therapy, for sure. She doesn\u2019t get a pass on irresponsible behavior just because she\u2019s sad and grieving- what line would your wife draw? Underage drinking? Partying? Sneaking out? Drugs? What would be acceptable to her because of your daughters grief? None of it should be, and your daughter needs to learn that no matter what shitty thing has happens we still have a responsibility to ourselves and others to behave appropriately.", "NTA, I am sorry for her BF but this does not mean a lifetime scot-free pass for being an AH and STEALING:", "NTA you are right.

These kinds of traditional punishments aren't that effective at the best of times. But right now? She's suffering, and acting out. Getting caught and riding with the sheriff were natural consequences for the shoplifting.

Your first paragraph sounds kind of dismissive of her relationship (maybe unintentionally); have you really considered what she's going through?", "NTA. Your daughter\u2018s legitimate need for support to process Chad\u2019s death doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s allowed to start stealing things, and she needs to understand that.
