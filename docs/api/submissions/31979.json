My wife made a comment to the effect of \u201cOh no, what if we both love it\u201d and I responded that of course this was not going to end our friendship and if one or the other really fell in love, we would back out. I assumed this comment was common sense, and would never come between us plus made it offhandedly as we all were drinking wine.\n\nMy wife and I decide to set up a showing first while all still hanging out and then they ended up setting one too.\n\nWe both go see it separately (us first) and tell each other we are both putting an offer on it. \n\nOur offer won out and they were livid. We gave them 24 hours before saying anything as we understand losing out on anything can be hard. 48 hours later my friends wife responded questioning our character and stating we intentionally betrayed referring to my comment about backing out if someone loved it.\n\nThese people were our very best friends, in our wedding, included in family events and the husband and I have been friends since 7th grade. \n\nWe apologized at length and even were texting amicably before the seller made a decision. So we had no idea they were upset we were bidding as they had no reaction when we told them the day prior (again my wife found the house).\n\nOur friendship of over 25 years is over and I am devastated. They assumed the worst intentions and after 7 months are still unwilling to even have a conversation. I tried hard at first but honestly the constant rejection or ignoring my attempts to reconcile took their toll. I think of them often and am still heartbroken. Part of me wants to start asking to talk again but the other part of me doesn\u2019t want to deal with the hurt and pain that will inevitably cause given we are so far apart on this.\n\nShould I have not bought the house because we showed it to them? This all transpired in under 24 hours and 7 months later they still won\u2019t speak to us. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand how we did anything different than they did but have no hard feelings on our end. I love them and miss them dearly but do I try to talk again or just let them go?\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1701226503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186excf/aita_for_buying_a_house_my_friends_wanted/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That your wife loved it and wanted it and \n\n\n2. knew that you would be putting an offer on it\n\n\n\n3. They decided that night that they would ALSO put an offer on the house that you & your wife showed them\n\n4. Then got mad at you for getting the house that they didn\u2019t even know about before they came over??\n\nIf that\u2019s all correct, then I\u2019m guessing that this isn\u2019t the first time that these so called friends have wanted something YOU have \n\nOR something that you\u2019ve wanted to have\n\nFor them, life is a competition with you\n\nThose aren\u2019t friends\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThem ghosting you is a favor in my opinion.  They have no justifiable reason to be upset with you.", "NTA. You told them about it in the first place. Anybody could have bid on the house and they had no special right or claim. \n\nHowever, stop apologizing. If they want to walk, don\u2019t lower yourself to simpering after their attention. Let them go, delete their numbers and move on.", "NTA. Their behavior is childish IMO.", "NTA", "NTA ridiculous.", "NTA Their behavior is absolutely ridiculous. Over a house.", "NTA, they sound like they are or maybe always were envious of things you guys had/wanted to have. While it is difficult to not have them as friends anymore, you did not do anything wrong and they are the ones losing out on good friends. Id say consider being friends only if they reach out, I would still be cautious.", "NTA. Why were they more entitled to get the house than you? Sounds like you had the higher bid.", "NTA.", "NTA and even if you did mange to reconcile it would never be the same and the renewed friendship wouldn't last. Try to move on. Look back with fond memories not sadness or regret.", "NTA\n\nLet them go. They were never genuine friends. You deserve friends who will be truly happy for your successes. Not friends who try to take your successes and throw adult tantrums when they don't get to 'win'.", "NTA - Adult communication has failed. Resort to childish mode. Text them \"Dibs\" if they are not receptive to that, accuse them of betrayal of highest degree for ignoring your dibs.", "NTA they were aware \n\nStop saying sorry to them.", "NTA.\nBoth parties knew they were viewing and offering on the house. Only one could get it. Simple math. \n\nThat they have cut you out of their life is not your fault.", "NAH  \n\n\nShit happens. People get angry over petty stuff. This was a miscommunication. You probably should have been clearer. They probably should have been clearer. You lost a friendship over a bit of greed and assumption. On both sides, but it does not excuse your part in it. Learn from it and move on.", "\" In Vino Veritas\"--you said what you thought was true while drinking . That was your truth--until you both fell in love with the house . Whether these friends are really just jealous copycats I do not know..... \n\nBut I personally I would feel guilty for saying that to a friend and then not keeping my word. \n\nBut then I really cherish true friends ....slight YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
