Sounds like hubby has a control thing and sil is his enabler. \n\nYou\u2019re right to not want to stay there. Your husband should be ashamed to call you petty! His sister and BIL are the petty ones. Why doesn\u2019t he have your back? Why bother going to see them at all? Creepy.", "NTA. Your boundary is on point here. You are neither overreacting nor being petty -- they were very rude hosts.", "Nta. That's just plain weird. Is it not her home too? Can she not make a judgement call? Or does she not trust you, but want to put the blame on her husband? Honestly, it doesn't sound like they're actually comfortable having people stay if they feel its necessary to chaperone their guests at all tines, so it would make everyone more comfortable in you got a hotel room.", "NTA that was bizarre and so fucking wrong. Stay where you're comfortable.", "NTA\nIf you have guests treat them like guests not parolees. If you don\u2019t like having people in your home just say no.

I can\u2019t believe your husband was ok with that.", "NTA - and I understand!  My SIL loves to throw people out of  her house and has done it to me and my sister.   She boasted she threw my sister out of the house because she ate too many cookies.     I would never stay in her house again ever.", "NTA. They essentailly locked you in a room because you had (what sounds like) a disfiguring injury, even if only temporarily. They might have their reasons, but if you don't want to go back there, it's justified.\n\nAlso, this is all irrelevant. Where you stay has nothing to do with the fun you have and the people you hang out with. It doesn't matter, so just go where you're comfortable.", "Wtf. Who confines a guest to one room while they go out shopping? Did they make you wear an ankle monitor too??", "NTA but your in-laws and your husband sure are.

They basically told you they don\u2019t trust you alone in their house\u2026 why on earth would you voluntarily subject yourself to that? If your husband doesn\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t want to be treated like a criminal in what should be a family home, then you have a serious husband problem. If the roles were reversed I\u2019m guessing your husband would never DREAM of confining his sister or BIL to the guest room in your home. \n\nDefinitely stay in a hotel- but better yet, get a separate room from your husband and let him know you simply don\u2019t trust him in your room alone.", "Unless you are a crackhead addict who steals from  family ( joking ) YNTA \n\nYour husband, his sister and bil are through they sound like dicks and shame on your OP behavior for the past visit and now this upcoming visit \nDude needs to support you better \n\n\nBook that hotel, enjoy room service and someone else making your bed", "Your SIL and honestly the whole fam is insane.", "YTA \n\nJust respect the rules.
