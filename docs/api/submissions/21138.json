Because it's impossible to learn good social skills from this kind of person, seek out a professional counselor to find out what empathy is and to make sure you have it.

They got exactly what they were asking for AND exactly what they deserved. They'll think twice before treating you this way again.", "Hell no, NTA. If they were just looking out for you, they wouldn\u2019t be insulting you and embarrassing you. They deserved to be called out.", "NTA\n\nIt is one thing to be concerned about their childs health and well being, however to publicly shame them for it and put them down is completely another.\n\nIf I were OP, I would be making active efforts in moving away from that toxic behavior.", "NTA 100%.   Seriously I hate the whole \"we just want X good thing\" well they have a crap way of going about it and should be the ones to reflect and last thing anyone wants in their home/family is that energy of a grease cover coach gollum saying some actor is 1 out of 10, in fact its even worse when directed to people in their immediate vicinity.  \n\n\nAnother way of looking at it is \"if you can't take it don't dish it out\" \"if you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen\" and other 1000s of ways of saying not to needle people if you can't handle them doing it back to you.    \n\n\nThey can shove their cold shoulder up their ass so they can warm it up.

Good luck OP, at this point, it's your body, your life, be healthy for you, but be comfortable, sorry they tore into you to the point that you have image issues, I can relate.", "NTA. I am so proud of you for standing up for yourself. Love yourself first and foremost. People often project the things they criticize in themselves onto others.

Genetics are a thing - if your parents body's are thick and hold weight in their stomachs, it makes sense you would too. \n\nSometimes, emotionally immature patents think they're being supportive because the root of their message is \"You don't seem your best self, and I'm worried about you.\" \n\nInstead of asking if you're getting enough sleep or time to make yourself less processed meals, their mouths say dumb shit and expect you to not react. It sucks that standing up for yourself came out harshly, but it's what you've known.", "NTA", "NTA.

Do you restrict your food intake? If so you\u2019d be better off learning about intuitive eating, the restricting-binge cycle, make sure you\u2019re eating enough, and find a therapist.\n\nResearch shows that our body, due to genetics and other factors, has a set weight it likes to maintain and when we try to dramatically change that we do all sorts of damage to our health and metabolism.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/video/cbs-reports-presents-speaking-frankly-fat-shaming/#x\n\nHas some interviews with people about fat shaming.
