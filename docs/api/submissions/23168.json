I took her to the doctor for a routine checkup and it turns out she has a few health issues (calcium, iron deficiency and weak bones, underweight). I also took her to the dentist and found out she has a few cavities.\n\nNaturally, we have to pay for her medicines and dental treatments and it cost a big ton. The money is not an issue for us, but I have always wanted my kids to be not spoiled and mindful of money despite the money we have as a family.\n\nOn the way out from the dentist, we were walking down the stairs and i told her, \"You know how much we spent on that? \\*x\\* much.\" and she said \"oh\" and remained silent. I wasn't sure if she got it or not so, since she had multiple appointments to get them all removed, i would tell her how much it cost for each time.\n\nI never said anything else, just, \"It cost \\*x\\* amount this time, you see how much money we're spending?\" all I really wanted was her to be more grateful. \n\nThen while paying for her medicines I did the same thing. Last night, my husband said that it makes her feel bad when I tell her how much money we spend on her and that she doesn't want any medicines because she doesn't want us to be \"wasting money\". \n\nI never said or implied we were wasting money. It was for her health so of course it all wasn't a waste. My husband said I was being insensitive to her and I should be more mindful as she's a kid.\n\nPersonally, my husband has always been extra protective so I think he's just being extra. I also don't understand why my kid spoke to him instead of straight to me. I don't think I am in the wrong here, just that my daughter has got the wrong idea and my husband is overreacting.\n\nAITA for telling my daughter how much things cost for her?\n\n(sorry this is written poorly.)", "created_utc": 1690362785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a0j43/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_how_much_money_we/", "score": 708, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your child is not stupid, she knows you are spending money on her medical/dental bills. You don't need to 'remind her' every single time. Hell you don't need to tell her at all. It's part of being a parent. You look after your child no matter the cost. I know you don't mean to be horrible, and you want to educate her on money, but there are better ways. E.g my parents gave me a budget to go shopping for a family dinner. That taught me the value of money. To be told everytime \"you realise how l much I just spent on you right?\" Is demoralising. I also image she went to her Dad because he listens to her. From this post alone you resort straight to \"but I didn't mean it that way\". Whether you meant it or not, your actions hurt your child so much that she doesn't want you to 'have to' to spend money on her medical care.", "Hey, I would like to remind you that you chose to have kids and are therefore responsible for their costs until they are (at least) 18. It's not like you're making big unnecessary purchases for her that she \"should be grateful for\" - it's basic healthcare we're talking about.\n\nAlso, I would give the fact that she felt comfortable talking to your husband but not to you some thought.\n\nAlso also, if you keep making her feel like anything she needs that costs money is such a big burden to you, she might not tell you about any health concerns she has in the future, because she scared to.

Or room decor, where she has to work hard for something and then is rewarded when she can pay for it herself. \n\nNot basic living expenses like doctors and dentist visits which are 100% your responsibility.\n\nAlso why is your daughter underweight? Are you telling her how much food costs and guilting her so she is not eat as much as she should, because she is saving you money? Seriously this is really worrying and sounds like you might have already seriously injured your daughter with your treatment.\n\nIt sounds like the damage has already been done and she will need serious therapy.

The message she is getting is not that she should be grateful, it is that she should just not tell you if she has health issues because it is a burden. Also, why should she be grateful? She is your underage child, paying for medical expenses is your legal obligation. \n\n Instead of a I love you and I worry about you chat, you are telling her \"It costs X much to keep you alive, and I am not sure I am getting my money's worth\".

Your daughter is already dealing with health issues, and constantly reminding her of the cost of her treatments can make her feel guilty and stressed. It may lead her to believe that her health problems are a burden to you, causing unnecessary emotional distress. You mentioned that the money is not an issue for your family, and your daughter's health is crucial. Emphasizing the cost of her treatments may inadvertently make her feel like a burden, and she might avoid seeking necessary medical care in the future due to guilt. Instead of repeatedly mentioning the cost, you can focus on teaching gratitude and responsibility in other ways.

I also took her to the dentist and found out she has a few cavities.\n\nNaturally, we have to pay for her medicines and dental treatments and it cost a big ton. The money is not an issue for us, but I have always wanted my kids to be not spoiled and mindful of money despite the money we have as a family.\n\nOn the way out from the dentist, we were walking down the stairs and i told her, \"You know how much we spent on that? \\*x\\* much.\" and she said \"oh\" and remained silent. I wasn't sure if she got it or not so, since she had multiple appointments to get them all removed, i would tell her how much it cost for each time.\n\nI never said anything else, just, \"It cost \\*x\\* amount this time, you see how much money we're spending?\" all I really wanted was her to be more grateful. \n\nThen while paying for her medicines I did the same thing. Last night, my husband said that it makes her feel bad when I tell her how much money we spend on her and that she doesn't want any medicines because she doesn't want us to be \"wasting money\". \n\nI never said or implied we were wasting money. It was for her health so of course it all wasn't a waste. My husband said I was being insensitive to her and I should be more mindful as she's a kid.\n\nPersonally, my husband has always been extra protective so I think he's just being extra.

I'm somewhat neurodiverse meaning that I'm more extreme in the 'same kinda things' as other people, and it's a permanent rather than every-so-often deal. Found out late in life so I've spent too much time over the years replaying conversations to figure out 'where I went wrong'.  \n\nAll this to explain the massive experience I have in noticing the following:\n\nPeople expect you to be following along the thought process that you have in your head. Sometimes, maybe even often, that is the case.  When you have been having a conversation and explicitly stating things then it can be easier, but the 'spreading activation' that leads one of your thoughts to another is based on your own experiences and memories.  Thus is does not always follow that someone else will, well, follow.\n\nIME this comes from both sexes, but happens more frequently with women 'in general' around making a point that someone may have a less than perfect response to and tends to be more the case with men when dealing with 'deep' thought or when dealing with instructions that they think you should 'know' how to do already. (Personally I think it's because men try to be consise/not waste time - maybe something along the lines of not patronising/having expectations of what you should know - facts and logic based, and women tend to be more along the lines of it's-not-as-rude-sounding-if-I-don't-say-it-so-bluntly)\n\nIf you want your daughter to understand your point then _make the point_, don't __infer__ the point.  You want her to take better care of herself because there is a cost associated with it, perhaps you'd like her to be more grateful, and I  expect that you're trying to instill the discipline so that she doesn't end up with those bills later.  But what you've actually told her is that there's a cost, and then left her to figure out the meaning.  It's equally as logical for her to wonder if you're expecting her to do something to pay it back, or that you're telling her that she is a burden.  You'd no doubt be shocked if she said something like that, but she's a kid. She has no idea of context, or what's 'important' to you unless you explain it.  All thoughts are equal at this point.  That's why parents have an important job, to show kids where priorities lie, how to think critically, and so I'm glad that she did ask her Dad because that means that you did something right and she didn't internalise it and she knows that she __can__ ask questions.  Good for doing that!\n\nAs a rule I recommend speaking about 1. The facts, then 2.  The interpretation, then 3. The application.  In this case it could be 1. We've spent a lot of money on this 2.  We don't begrudge it, but it says that something isn't right,  As parents we are responsible, and we failed to stop this happening. 3. Let's figure out a plan to try and make this better.  Not about money, but how can we help you to look after yourself (the application is very person specific). \n\n IME this allows you to 'untangle' an argument.  They can question an application without questioning a fact.  They can dispute a fact without you thinking they're trying to disparage an application.  You can discuss different interpretations, because those things are what lead to an outcome/application, so if you're not on the same page then they'll never 'buy-in' to the application and it'll always be an uphill struggle.\n\nJust my 2p from a random internet Dad.  \n\nNo matter what, don't 'infer' that you are a bad mother or whatever from this thread - no-one knows you other than you, but use it to self-examine and then you can actually talk about it to your husband and kid - crazy as it sounds - you may get an insight or two!", "Yes this exactly.
