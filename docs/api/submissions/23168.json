I took her to the doctor for a routine checkup and it turns out she has a few health issues (calcium, iron deficiency and weak bones, underweight). I also took her to the dentist and found out she has a few cavities.\n\nNaturally, we have to pay for her medicines and dental treatments and it cost a big ton. The money is not an issue for us, but I have always wanted my kids to be not spoiled and mindful of money despite the money we have as a family.\n\nOn the way out from the dentist, we were walking down the stairs and i told her, \"You know how much we spent on that? \\*x\\* much.\" and she said \"oh\" and remained silent. I wasn't sure if she got it or not so, since she had multiple appointments to get them all removed, i would tell her how much it cost for each time.\n\nI never said anything else, just, \"It cost \\*x\\* amount this time, you see how much money we're spending?\" all I really wanted was her to be more grateful. \n\nThen while paying for her medicines I did the same thing. Last night, my husband said that it makes her feel bad when I tell her how much money we spend on her and that she doesn't want any medicines because she doesn't want us to be \"wasting money\". \n\nI never said or implied we were wasting money. It was for her health so of course it all wasn't a waste. My husband said I was being insensitive to her and I should be more mindful as she's a kid.\n\nPersonally, my husband has always been extra protective so I think he's just being extra. I also don't understand why my kid spoke to him instead of straight to me. I don't think I am in the wrong here, just that my daughter has got the wrong idea and my husband is overreacting.\n\nAITA for telling my daughter how much things cost for her?\n\n(sorry this is written poorly.)", "created_utc": 1690362785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a0j43/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_how_much_money_we/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids shouldn't have to feel grateful that they have access to health care, nor should they feel guilt for having medical issues that they did not know about. \n\nI am all for kids, especially teenagers learning the value of a dollar and a budget, but taking your kids to the dentist and other medical professional is not equal to them being spoiled in the slightest.

Why do you feel the need to tell your child how much essentials are costing.

Your child is not stupid, she knows you are spending money on her medical/dental bills. You don't need to 'remind her' every single time. Hell you don't need to tell her at all. It's part of being a parent. You look after your child no matter the cost. I know you don't mean to be horrible, and you want to educate her on money, but there are better ways. E.g my parents gave me a budget to go shopping for a family dinner. That taught me the value of money. To be told everytime \"you realise how l much I just spent on you right?\" Is demoralising. I also image she went to her Dad because he listens to her. From this post alone you resort straight to \"but I didn't mean it that way\". Whether you meant it or not, your actions hurt your child so much that she doesn't want you to 'have to' to spend money on her medical care.", "Hey, I would like to remind you that you chose to have kids and are therefore responsible for their costs until they are (at least) 18. It's not like you're making big unnecessary purchases for her that she \"should be grateful for\" - it's basic healthcare we're talking about.\n\nAlso, I would give the fact that she felt comfortable talking to your husband but not to you some thought.\n\nAlso also, if you keep making her feel like anything she needs that costs money is such a big burden to you, she might not tell you about any health concerns she has in the future, because she scared to.

Or room decor, where she has to work hard for something and then is rewarded when she can pay for it herself. \n\nNot basic living expenses like doctors and dentist visits which are 100% your responsibility.\n\nAlso why is your daughter underweight? Are you telling her how much food costs and guilting her so she is not eat as much as she should, because she is saving you money? Seriously this is really worrying and sounds like you might have already seriously injured your daughter with your treatment.\n\nIt sounds like the damage has already been done and she will need serious therapy.

The message she is getting is not that she should be grateful, it is that she should just not tell you if she has health issues because it is a burden. Also, why should she be grateful? She is your underage child, paying for medical expenses is your legal obligation. \n\n Instead of a I love you and I worry about you chat, you are telling her \"It costs X much to keep you alive, and I am not sure I am getting my money's worth\".

Your daughter is already dealing with health issues, and constantly reminding her of the cost of her treatments can make her feel guilty and stressed. It may lead her to believe that her health problems are a burden to you, causing unnecessary emotional distress. You mentioned that the money is not an issue for your family, and your daughter's health is crucial. Emphasizing the cost of her treatments may inadvertently make her feel like a burden, and she might avoid seeking necessary medical care in the future due to guilt. Instead of repeatedly mentioning the cost, you can focus on teaching gratitude and responsibility in other ways. Encourage her to take care of her health, discuss the importance of medical treatments, and emphasize that her well-being is a priority for the family.", "YTA, I don\u2019t think you understand just how much you hurt your child by doing that.

I also took her to the dentist and found out she has a few cavities.\n\nNaturally, we have to pay for her medicines and dental treatments and it cost a big ton. The money is not an issue for us, but I have always wanted my kids to be not spoiled and mindful of money despite the money we have as a family.\n\nOn the way out from the dentist, we were walking down the stairs and i told her, \"You know how much we spent on that? \\*x\\* much.\" and she said \"oh\" and remained silent. I wasn't sure if she got it or not so, since she had multiple appointments to get them all removed, i would tell her how much it cost for each time.\n\nI never said anything else, just, \"It cost \\*x\\* amount this time, you see how much money we're spending?\" all I really wanted was her to be more grateful. \n\nThen while paying for her medicines I did the same thing. Last night, my husband said that it makes her feel bad when I tell her how much money we spend on her and that she doesn't want any medicines because she doesn't want us to be \"wasting money\". \n\nI never said or implied we were wasting money. It was for her health so of course it all wasn't a waste. My husband said I was being insensitive to her and I should be more mindful as she's a kid.\n\nPersonally, my husband has always been extra protective so I think he's just being extra.

I don't think I am in the wrong here, just that my daughter has got the wrong idea and my husband is overreacting.\n\nAITA for telling my daughter how much things cost for her?\n\n(sorry this is written poorly.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I could see if she was wanting expensive clothes etc. but medical?", "I didn't know if I was in the wrong about telling her the cost or not, now I know I was wrong about that. That's it.

You all keep trying to diagnose MY kid who I raised like you're the professionals and have examined her.
