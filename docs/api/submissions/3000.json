According to the city, they had given the landlord multiple notices to fix the violations, but he just wouldn't comply. I initially didn't want my mom to move in with us because she's an absolute narcissist, I've seen it throughout my entire childhood, and because I've been with my fiance since we were 16, he's seen it as well. So we were both unsure. Ultimately my fiance said that he would feel bad if my mom had ended up homeless, so we talked and we agreed to let her stay for 90 days in our guest room so that she could find her a place (she currently doesn't pay rent because we want her to save her money for a place) \n\nHowever, my biggest worry about my mom living with us has come true. It took practically no time for her to act as if our home is hers. We've gotten into multiple arguments because of her trying to control things such as the way my fiance responds to her, when the dishes are done, or how grocery shopping gets handled. However today blew things over the top for me, my fiance has custody of his siblings *13 F and 10 M* and currently they are out for Thanksgiving break, my fiance is at work so I decided to get some shopping done with the kids. After breakfast the kids and I got ready and headed out. While out, my mom called me about 5 times ranting and raving about the fact that my finances' brother  left his house slippers by the couch and how it was disgusting and we need to teach him manners. I was so fed up so I went home and told her \"This isn't your house, stop acting like it is. This is his  *finances' brother* house, as long as his brother or I don't have an issue where his shoes are, he can leave his shoes wherever he'd like, because it's our house.\" This led us into an argument and my mom calling her niece and making it seem as if I just \"blew up\" on her for no reason, which led to my cousin calling me and saying that I'm making my mom feel unwanted. I'm not trying to be an asshole to her, but she can't just try to control an entire house of people.\n\nEdit: My fiance doesn't respond to my mom in a rude way, he has a really monotone voice and somehow my mom misinterpret it as attitude.", "created_utc": 1669152935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z25tfz/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_house_isnt_hers/", "score": 502, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
