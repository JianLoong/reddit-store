She has schizophrenia and he was her main caretaker. After he passed he left my uncle in charge of his estate. He also ended up being in charge of my Mom\u2019s care and finances. \n\nTwo to three months after my Dad\u2019s passing my Uncle wanted to put my Mom in an assisted living home. I had concerns about this as it was new for her and i felt like he was moving too quickly after my Dad\u2019s death. When I asked why he wanted to move her out he said it was because of her finances. I was not informed on her estate planning or finances so I asked if he could sit me down and explain everything. He ended up shutting my request down and said it was not any of my business.\n\nI asked my Mom if she wanted me involved and she said yes. Afterwards I ended up hiring an attorney to inform me on her estate planning. It turns out there was a trust my Uncle was in charge of where both my Mom and I were beneficiaries. He never informed me that i was beneficiary. Had I not went out of my way to get involved i\u2019m not sure he would have told me. \n\nIt was frustrating to find I was a beneficiary and that i was left of the dark. It was also a hard position to be in where my Uncle was shutting me out of the decision-making process of my Mom\u2019s care and well-being in addition to be informed. \n\nI was only 24 at the time but hiring an attorney seemed like the right thing to do. I\u2019m my parents only child. I was my dad\u2019s poa when he got sick so it was not regular for me not to be involved in their affairs. I also had concerns about what role I might have to play in my mom\u2019s future. It was unclear if I would have to financial support her in some way or act as a caretaker if something happened to him. \n\nAnyway hiring a lawyer ended up causing drama and uncle thinks I\u2019m asshole for creating problems by asserting myself into what was going on.

You were very smart to hire lawyer to make sure everything is done properly and also protect your mother and your interest.  \n\nHonestly, your uncle cannot be trusted.", "NTA. You should not feel guilty for standing up for your mother and yourself. As the \u201ctrustee\u201d your uncle technically has a fiduciary duty towards your mom and you. Sadly, money makes things difficult for most and I hope you don\u2019t have to go after him for control at some point. Don\u2019t let him bully you \u2014 he\u2019s definitely the AH here.", "NTA. Clearly uncle was doing dodgy stuff and is just upset he got caught.", "NTA how is it not your place to get involved in what happens to your own mother? It is definitely your place, in fact much more than his. Your father probably only named him because you were too young to be taking that responsibility. He is supposed to honor that, not try to take advantage of you and your poor mother.", "NTA your uncle cares about money. Not you, and not your mom. That\u2019s why he\u2019s mad, because he is a greedy ahole.

It's not as if he's got anything to hide, is it?", "NTA.  If you are a beneficiary then it very much is your business and even if you weren\u2019t, as her son, your mothers business is your business.  \n\nFrom what little I know, and based on what nonspecific info you\u2019ve share Do: Did your dad ask him to take on this role in writing?  Cause if it was only a verbal request, your uncle doesn\u2019t have the right.  Your mom is your dad\u2019s legal next of kin, and if she is incompetent then you are and your uncle is inserting himself where he doesn\u2019t actually have a right to be.", "NTA - and for obvious reasons. With the information that you have provided, it appears that your uncle is up to no good. And obviously it IS your place to get involved, both for you and to advocate for your mother.", "NTA. He's keeping secrets, refusing to discuss things and acting as if you shouldn't care about your own mother. Very suspicious. You needs to protect your mother and yourself. Getting a lawyer was the right thing for you to do.", "NTA. Your uncle tried to shut you out when you clearly needed to be involved. Kudos to you for not just taking his word!", "NTA! That\u2019s your mom! Arguably, you\u2019re more qualified to be in charge of her care. Your uncle doesn\u2019t care about her well-being like you do or would.\n\nHowever; he might not be wrong. Schizophrenia is a tough mental illness that can affect the brain in many ways, especially as we age. You didn\u2019t say how old she is, but being a caregiver can be a draining and difficult process and her being in a care facility might be the best for everyone. Just a food for thought. My Nan had Alzheimer\u2019s and my mom insisted we care for her ourselves and it was a disaster in every way.  But, you absolutely should have gotten a lawyer and you absolutely should be involved in her care decisions.", "NTA.  I'd go further and hire an accountant to take a look at the books for the Trust.  He didn't tell you that you were also a beneficiary, what if you are supposed to be getting a small stipend from the Trust and he's decided you don't need it and is keeping it for himself.

Trusts can have a variety of stipulations. You could potentially have free access to those funds even if your uncle is trustee.

Luckily my husband was an only child.    Our lawyer said that people get very greedy and petty when someone dies.  Everyone thinks they are entitled.  If you had POA then clearly your parents want you to be the beneficiary to everything they have/had.  Uncle sounds like he is trying to weasel his way in, in hopes of claiming something.  \nHopefully you'll be able to legally take control and keep your uncle out of it.

It doesn't matter what your uncle thinks. That's your mom and you're looking out for her, as you should.

I'm not a lawyer, but you should probably explore this further with yours.", "NTA, he was definitely trying to steal from you. If he wasn't he would have provided you all the information you requested. I'm sure him knowing best means he takes all of your parents money and items, dumps your mom in a home, and leaves you with nothing because him getting a buck is what's best for you.", "NTA.

Would ask your lawyer", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Actually, I think OP should go after uncle for control, as it doesn't seem he can be trusted.", "OP, this is good advice", "Agreed. This sounds and feels very suspicious. The Uncle had a fiduciary duty to inform OP about the trust. His failure to do so raises many questions.\n\nOP: If you are in the US speak to the attorney about whether or not it is a good idea to get Adult Protective Services involved. The failure to inform you of the trust and the desire to move your Mom to assisted living seem financially motivated, out of sight out of mind.\n\nYou should also find out from the attorney if the trust can be amended so that 2 signatures are required before any money is moved out of the trust on behalf of your Mother.\n\nInfo: Does your Mom own the house where she lives? If so is the mortgage paid off? If so getting caretakers to allow your Mom to age in place will likely be more cost effective and provide her with more peace of mind. I did this for my Dad and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. He had the comfort of home while aging in place. \n\nSorry for your loss. Good luck with everything.", "Uncle was hoping he could empty the Trust as mum's representative before OP figured it out.", "Or liquidate the value of the house by selling it, which would then be money outside of the trust and far easier to abscond with."]}
