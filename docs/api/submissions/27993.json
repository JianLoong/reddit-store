I had concerns about this as it was new for her and i felt like he was moving too quickly after my Dad\u2019s death. When I asked why he wanted to move her out he said it was because of her finances. I was not informed on her estate planning or finances so I asked if he could sit me down and explain everything. He ended up shutting my request down and said it was not any of my business.\n\nI asked my Mom if she wanted me involved and she said yes. Afterwards I ended up hiring an attorney to inform me on her estate planning. It turns out there was a trust my Uncle was in charge of where both my Mom and I were beneficiaries. He never informed me that i was beneficiary. Had I not went out of my way to get involved i\u2019m not sure he would have told me. \n\nIt was frustrating to find I was a beneficiary and that i was left of the dark.

It was unclear if I would have to financial support her in some way or act as a caretaker if something happened to him. \n\nAnyway hiring a lawyer ended up causing drama and uncle thinks I\u2019m asshole for creating problems by asserting myself into what was going on.

His failure to do so raises many questions.\n\nOP: If you are in the US speak to the attorney about whether or not it is a good idea to get Adult Protective Services involved. The failure to inform you of the trust and the desire to move your Mom to assisted living seem financially motivated, out of sight out of mind.\n\nYou should also find out from the attorney if the trust can be amended so that 2 signatures are required before any money is moved out of the trust on behalf of your Mother.\n\nInfo: Does your Mom own the house where she lives? If so is the mortgage paid off? If so getting caretakers to allow your Mom to age in place will likely be more cost effective and provide her with more peace of mind.
