About 11 months ago, we decided to move in with each other. I was very excited because I really felt I had a bond with her.

My girlfriend immediately woke up, and was so mad at me. We had spent time saving up for it, and now I had ruined it. She was so mad that she started screaming at me and even woke the neighbors up, keep in mind it was 2 AM. A few days after that, she started ignoring me and eventually broke up with me. I wasn't intoxicated, and I guess it made sense for her to yell at me since people she knew would always say she had anger issues, but we really didn't fight often and I felt really bad.\n\nPersonally, I believe that I am not the asshole because I didn't have control on the fact that I peed on our bed, I didn't mean to and there's always the option to save up for a new bed. I texted her and asked her to let me back into her life, but she said no and that she can't ever stand to face me after that. I am so incredibly upset that I've lost two years over a relationship and I don't know what to do.

And it\u2019s not worth it to get a list of reasons she didn\u2019t want to be with you anymore it will only hurt more so she probably just used the peeing on the bed as the last straw.

I don\u2019t think that OP\u2019s gf should have yelled/screamed, but OP is still on the hook for not doing anything substantial to fix the situation.
