He spent over a month in ICU, and against all odds, he\u2019s alive.  He apologized for his actions and I decided to let him live with me while he physically recovered.  It was good for a few months, he was actually able to spend time with his kid, and really embraced being a dad. Until last week. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s well enough to walk to the liquor store now, which he did, and he was on a rampage.  So I pulled out my phone and started recording because he loves to deny he\u2019s done anything.  In his words, \u201cI can\u2019t feel bad if I don\u2019t remember\u201d \n\nWhile I was recording, I asked him to make a choice, be an homeless alcoholic again, or be a father.  He very clearly made his choice and multiple times stated alcohol was the winner.  \nI told him he has to man up and tell his son why he won\u2019t be around again, because I\u2019m tired of being the bad guy.  When he refused, I told him I recorded our conversation and would show it to the kid for him.  He freaked out and called me a disgusting person and all sorts of other names.  \n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have recorded him in that state, but in my opinion, ignoring what was said and blacking out isn\u2019t an excuse to not take accountability. So AITA for recoding him?\n\n\nEdit to answer some questions: \nI\u2019m involved because his 10 years old child lives with me full time and has for years, the mom isn\u2019t in the picture.  \n\nI\u2019m not going to actually show the child the video, but I wanted my brother to take accountability for once in his life.  Accept he messed up, and attempt to own it. \nI know this cycle, and he\u2019s going to tell the kid that I kicked him out, which is not true.

I guess...INFO: why do you say you're \"tired of being the bad guy\"? Also, how old is his kid? If the kids like 20 that's one thing, but I sure hope you aren't planning on showing like a 7 year old a video of his drunk dad choosing alchohol over him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it looks like you were planning on showing the kid the video until you saw some of the replies coming in. So, it would\u2019ve been ESH.  I feel bad for your brother. Hope he can get some help and have a relationship with his kid. \n\nKudos for stepping up!", "For recording your brother or for showing to his son? Under the circumstance described, NTA for recording. But do not show that to the kid; it would serve no purpose put to hurt me further and, possibly, make you look better (probably not, because showing that to the kid would be horrible.)", "NTA Your brother has made his choice. And if he can\u2019t remember, well, the video can refresh his memory if he gets feisty. \n\nUpload his drunken episode to the cloud so it doesn\u2019t go \u201cmissing\u201d. You are a good person for raising his child. And for taking him in to recuperate. NTA", "NTA. If you have to remember, then it is only fair he gets to remember too.", "NTA: It will be interesting to see how he reacts when he sees the video sober.\n\nIf he tells your nibling you kicked him out don't deny it. Let the child know for their safety and yours their father is not allowed to live with you if he drinks. He knew that and not only drank but got absolutely drunk.\n\nHave you gotten the courts involved? You might be able to get financial assistance with raising the child and you might need backup to deal with the father. The child is lucky to have you in their life.", "NTA and please look into Al-Anon, including here on Reddit.  For family and friends of alcoholics.", "NTA and awesome job taking care of this kid.  Unless your brother gets sober and proves he will stay sober, it might be best for the kid to have him out of his life completely and for good", "NTA especially since you don\u2019t plan on showing anyone else.", "Thank you. I agree. His son has been though enough and doesn\u2019t need to see that.  But I will definitely be showing my brother.", "I\u2019m going to show it to my brother when he wakes up, I\u2019m not going to show his child.", "I should have clarified in the post.  His child has been living with me for years, every time my brother goes to jail or rehab or just on a long bender and no one knows if he\u2019s alive or dead, I have to be the one to tell his child why he\u2019s gone.  I\u2019m so tired of breaking that kids heart.  \nBy brother is choosing to leave again, and this time, I want him to tell his child why he\u2019s not coming around.", "Okay heavy NTA here (also you might want to edit this info into your post because it absolutely changes my view on things.)\n\nDon't show the kid the video. They don't need to see that. I know you're tired of breaking his heart, but showing him that video will only break it again and harder. No child should have to see their dad like that. Not even for the dads sake, it's for the child's. \n\nBut I absolutely agree with you wanting your brother to be the one to tell it. I can't even blame you for threatening to show the video, just please keep it a threat, I'm begging you. I come from a long line of alcoholics, and I can't help but put myself in the kids shoes, imagining how it would feel to see that video. \n\nBut he needs to be the one to tell the kid, youre right. Whether he does that or not, will be his choice. The only way you become TA here is if you actually show the kid that video. And again, that won't be you being an asshole to your brother, but the kid. \n\nYou need to let this be the last time this man comes in and out of this kids life. If you are willing to, I'd honestly go so far as to petition for legal custody (since it sounds like there isn't a mother in the photo.) This isn't a stable life for a child. I get it if you can't or if you live somewhere where that's just not realistic, but God if you can and would be willing, that would probably be the best thing for the child at this point.", "I really appreciate your reply.  I will definitely not show his child that video. And I think petitioning for custody is my next step. The mother comes around when it\u2019s convenient for her, but that\u2019s maybe once a month. Luckily last night the kid was with her, so he wasn\u2019t there to witness his dads behavior.  \n\nI am the godmother, but I know that hold no weight legally. But i need to do something. That kid is my #1 priority.  I will do anything in my power to protect him.  Even if it\u2019s protecting him from his own parents.", "Well, it\u2019s time to see about *getting* legal standing/custody. It sounds like neither parent can be counted on and somebody has to make decisions and be responsible, especially in the case of an emergency.", "NTA, I'm an alcoholic and while I can feel the same cold fear and shame your brother does right now, you are NOT in the wrong.  And wouldn't be even if there wasn't a child involved.", "NTA but alcohol definitely tops being a parent.\n\nSounds like you might be figuring that out too.", "NTA. Sadly, the video probably won\u2019t change his behavior, as alcoholism requires a lot of work and treatment to overcome (plus lifelong maintenance and care), and he doesn\u2019t seem to want to do it, but at least he can no longer deny what he\u2019s doing and the damage he\u2019s causing.\n\nMake sure his kid doesn\u2019t see the video or hear you two talking about this, and possibly try to get legal custody before his father harms him, be it through neglect or anger or what have you.\n\nAs a side note, I have alcoholics and addicts in my family and I\u2019m sorry you have been roped in and your hand has been forced. It\u2019s a horrible feeling.", "Do not show it to him or he could errase it. Forward it to him. Tell him if he keeps it up, you will forward it to anyone you witness him telling he doesn\u2019t have a drinking problem. (but not to your nephew, of course.)", "With the cloud this is a small and easily circumvented concern. Just email the video to yourself.", "NTA, but I wanna know: Who is funding his habit? Someone is giving him money for the booze.", "ESH\n\nYour brother for clear reasons. You for letting this angry violent drunk to re-enter his kids life and get their hopes up. It causes instability and eventually the kid will get old enough to question why you didn\u2019t protect them more", "It sounds more like he\u2019s your son now"]}
