Well, after the trip, my son called me. They\u2019d seen pictures of me and the other grandchildren at the parks, and he\u2019s livid I didn\u2019t even invite his son to join us.

He\u2019s not really going to understand the money situation. \n\nHowever, your son needs to sit down if he\u2019s taking loans off you and still wants you to pay for his child\u2019s Disney trip when your not even paying for the other children!\n\nJust bad timing I guess?\n\nEdit: it\u2019s been pointed out to me your son didn\u2019t ask you to pay and you didn\u2019t approach him to ask if he could before hand. That\u2019s leaning in to asshole territory. Maybe your son couldn\u2019t afford a family trip realistically but could pay the way for his son alone. \n\nAlso, on a second read I realised you let them find out through social media???? You could have at least spoken to them about it and explained the situation before hand, jeez.", "Gentle YTA for not letting your son know that the trip was happening and giving him a chance to send his son. You left your grandson out and he's too young to understand why.", "NTA. How did his 6 year olds even find out? I don\u2019t get why parents tell their little kids these things then get upset at other people, when the kid wouldn\u2019t even be upset if they didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s just crazy and entitled.", "first of all, what kind of parent would tell their child that their cousins went to disneyland and grandma invited allllll of them but not him?  that's really shitty.  \n\nwhy didn't your oldest son also talk to your other son?  he talked to his sister but not his other sibling who also has a child?  or why didn't your daughter talk to him?  i feel like there should have been communication among your kids, about all the grandkids being involved.  that would have been my first question to my kids, did you talk to both your siblings?\n\nthe trip wasn't your idea, you didn't initiate it, and you didn't pay for it.  i feel like that sort of absolves you from some responsibility.  BUT, you're mom, and you might have made sure all of your kids knew what was going on, that way they could have all organized something so all the grandkids could have gone.\n\nESH.", "INFO: Why didn't your two elder children think to invite the youngest grandchild?", "NTA: \"I can't afford it\" was a true statement, & if you son still owes you money, he really can't afford it either. You might offer to take the youngest when your son can pay for both of you to go. In my opinion, six years old is a bit young to handle a full day at Disney. Your grandson might enjoy it more when he is a bit older.", "I'm not entirely sure that YTA per se, but I think it was sort of inconsiderate not to even mention this trip?", "I *definitely* don't think that your son and his wife are TA for feeling left out.\n\nI don't think that you would have been TA for doing this trip... But YTA for, by the sounds of it, *not telling them and letting them find out via social media.* That is screwed up. OK, maybe they couldn't have afforded it, but they still should have had a courtesy heads up (and *IMO* you and your other kids ought to have considered taking the 6 year old, even if not with his parents. Maybe paying for three would be too much, but not paying for 1. But that is a separate judgement independent thought).", "YTA: You should have at least called your son and asked if they could afford to send their son with you or maybe asked his siblings if they could chip in for their nephew.\n\nAt the very least not post any pictures of the event. That's just cruel.", "YTA for not inviting them/their child and deciding for them that they couldn\u2019t afford it. You didn\u2019t even give them an opportunity to say no, and they\u2019re saying they would\u2019ve made it work. Your poor grandson won\u2019t understand any of the reasons he will just see that he was excluded.", ">I felt bad for going without my youngest grandchild\n\nSo bad that it never even crossed your mind to talk to his parents or arrange something special for him that was more cost effective but would show he is just as loved? YTA", "I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted but NTA. First of all, you weren\u2019t paying. Personally, if I\u2019ve loaned someone money multiple times (and I\u2019m assuming they haven\u2019t repaid you if you can\u2019t afford to take the grandchild yourself), offering them to take their child to Disney IF they paid, would be a slap in the face to me if they said yes. They can afford Disney, but not repay their debts? Next comes the guilt trip they\u2019re giving about them seeing the other kids at the parks. So, I\u2019m assuming they saw on social media or some family photo sharing app? Which their 6 year old has access to? I don\u2019t think so. Either they\u2019re lying that the kid is upset and it\u2019s really your son who is upset, or they purposely showed the child pictures of his cousins having fun without him to upset him so they could guilt you. Either way, your son is an AH, not you.", "YTA.  The invite, with a disclaimer about not being able to cover a ticket, costs nothing and would have gone a long way in this situation.  I don't think OP was purposely malicious here, but they were inadvertently the AH in this story.", "YTA for not at least telling your son and explaining why you couldn't take your grandson. But you had good intentions.", "NTA, the angry son already owes you money and you didn't organize the trip, you just subbed in for your older son who couldn't go and then your daughter invited herself.", "I hate to say it, but YTA. I get you couldn\u2019t have afforded to pay for him, but you could have at least given your son the chance to find a way for your grandson to come. Or a heads up so he could find an easier way of breaking the news to him. Instead they had to find out on social media, which I can imagine probably felt like a slap in the face and was heartbreaking for him.", "YTA - To me, this is simply a communication mixup. I understand your reasoning for not asking and I feel like you're intentions were good but it looks really bad to exclude them like that. You should have reached out and invited them and you could've explained the situation to them and let them decide. I think you owe your son an apology because I feel I'd be pretty upset in his shoes tbh", "YTA for posting on social media.", "NTA\n\nYou couldn't afford it and this was not planned. Also, if he could find a way to send him to Disney,  why couldn't he find a way to pay you back? Also, how many days transpired between being asked to take her and actually leaving? Did you have to fly, get a hotel, and pay for food?", "YTA. You should have invited him, bc it looks like you singled him out.", "Soft YTA. You could have at least invited your youngest grandchild with the expectation that they'd have to pay his way.", "NTA but you still should have told him about the trip prior to taking it. There would be less bad blood if it didn't seem like a secret. You could have advised him that you'd be happy to have them go with you if he could pay back the loans and pay his own way on the trip. You're not at fault, but you might've handled it better.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t your trip to begin with, you didn\u2019t pay for it, the only reason your daughter knew and tagged along is because she discussed it with your son whose trip it was to begin with and paid her own way. You didn\u2019t call your daughter and invite her to come why would you think to call your son to invite invite his son when the your son is broke and owes you money and you know you can\u2019t afford to pay for the cold either.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an intentional snub and he\u2019s the AH for pointing out to his 6yr old that you went just to be petty and get the child upset with everyone that did.", "YTA \n\nYou should have told them. 6 years is actually the best age to go, Disney is very childish", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even give him and his wife a chance to send their child to possible a once in a lifetime trip! There\u2019s something that could of possibly been worked out to allow the youngest to do, and you denied him of that chance. You\u2019re absolutely positively TA!!!", "NTA they literally owe you money, everyone saying you should have asked if they can afford it are seemingly ignoring that. \n\nIf they can afford Disney tickets, they can afford to make payments on their loans. Otherwise, it\u2019s entitled to expect you to take their son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not like grandma paid for everything and didn\u2019t include the 6 year old.", "From a personal prospective, my sister and her husband can\u2019t afford shit. As a sibling you\u2019re always torn between do we invite them to be nice and include them? Or will it feel like we are rubbing it in their face that they can\u2019t afford to do something the rest of us can. I mean my older sister and I are planning a trip to Japan and we aren\u2019t inviting my other sister, she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for herself let alone her husband and children. And we can\u2019t afford to carry their portion either. I would love for my nieces to have the opportunity but it\u2019s just not feasible.\n\nMaybe our family dynamic is different and it\u2019s an unspoken understanding between us, who knows but a part of me can understand why they wouldn\u2019t put it out there. You get excited at the prospect and then feel shitty that you\u2019re not even remotely close to affording something like that. I\u2019ve been there too.", "It was initially just supposed to be my son and his daughter. When my daughter decided to come with her two boys, it was really last minute.

If no one told him then he wouldn\u2019t have been upset.", "If the son owes her money and suddenly can afford for his kid to go to Disney then the son is still the AH. And who showed the kid the social media photos to have him crying for hours? The 6 year old saw it on his own? Don\u2019t think so. Son either told him to upset him, which makes him a shitty parent, or he\u2019s lying about the kid being upset. Son is the AH. He can be pissed for being left out when he repays his financial debts. The only way his kid would know about this is if he told him.", "If the kids parents already owe the mother money they shouldn\u2019t be concerned about paying for their child to go to Disney land. It\u2019s common courtesy if you owe someone money you pay them back before splurging on things that aren\u2019t necessities. \n\nYou\u2019re also suggesting that someone else pay the child\u2019s way, which would be great but the mother already stated she didn\u2019t have the money so you\u2019re assuming the siblings should pay. What makes you think that if the brother has already asked his mother for two loans that he hasn\u2019t already asked his siblings as well? Personally, I\u2019d go to my siblings before I went to my parents. Overall, it\u2019s not their responsibility. I totally understand wanting to take a innocent child to experience something like that, especially Disney land but if you haven\u2019t recently looked at the prices. Disney costs an arm and a leg. It\u2019s not logical to expect everyone else except the parents to shovel out money.", "If they already owe her money than it\u2019s pretty well known that they can\u2019t afford it and neither can she. It\u2019s a shiesty situation but she is definitely not at fault and they have no reason to be mad at her.", "So she should let them go to Disneyland on her dime because they owe her money. She\u2019s loaned them money twice so if they can afford to take their kids to Disneyland, they can afford to pay her back.", "Heartbreaking to who? The 6 year old? Who only knew if his father told him. Which makes her son the AH.", "She didn\u2019t say it was her who posted it.", "So everyone who posts on social media is an AH? Does that mean you\u2019re one for commenting?", "But they owe her money. How are they affording to take their kids to Disney land but they can\u2019t pay her back.", "Oh good point!", "Exactly! I think that would have been the fairest attitude and way of handling it. Unless OP thinks her son would have tried to \u201csabotage\u201d the trip if he knew in advance, then to me there is no reason she couldn\u2019t have at least given them the chance to find a way for him to be included.", "But he's an adult,  and that's his choice to make. She can't make choices for him.  She also shouldn't give him any money,  but that's her choice. In this situation, she's the AH because she took away that choice. If her son was 16 or 18, I'd agree.  He's an adult.\n\nETA: if she'd have let him know ahead of time that she's doing it,  but can't take 6 because of $$ issues, that's fine and she's well within her rights to set boundaries.  It's the not even telling him that makes her the AH. \nHer son is an AH for letting his kid cry/ believe they didn't want him.", "No I agree with you. This is a very hard line to walk when families have different finances.\n\nYou can\u2019t keep your family from doing things because it may hurt someone\u2019s feelings.

I think this a very important detail to add to the post.", "ESH\n\nYou should have talked as an extended family about this. This is the kind of thing that causes huge rifts in a family. At the same time, your youngest shouldn't have flipped out on you and sabotaged his kid's relationship with his cousins.\n\nYou and your two eldest kids should find a way to make it up to your youngest.", "Why are you acting like this 6 year old is never gonna see his cousins? You really think a bunch of kids aren't gonna talk about going to disney with grandma?", "Still did they need to find out on social media?", "Good point, but all this could have been figured out with decent communication. \n\n\u201cHey mom, I understand I owe you this amount, but would you be ok with me spending what I could/would have given towards that debt on this trip so your grandson can be included?\u201d. \n\nOr perhaps they might have borrowed from somewhere else. Definitely not the most responsible thing to do, but I do get that some childhood memories are once in a lifetime and you can never replace them once lost. I suppose it depends on how much value they place on it. \n\nThey weren\u2019t given a chance to try, so OP and her son will never know.", "> But he's an adult, and that's his choice to make. \n\nIf he didn't get two loans from her I would agree. But he's clearly not stable right now & adult or not it's better to not give him the option to sink further into debt.\n\nI do completely agree with your edit though. OP's in the clear for me, but her son's a major AH for telling the kid about the trip.", "Exactly!", "So the 6 year old has access to social media? I doubt it. The son either is lying about his kid being upset about seeing the pictures, or he purposely showed his kid to upset him and guilt his mother for not taking him. Either way, her son is the AH, not her.", "Did she post them? because there\u2019s nowhere in the post that says she did.  The sister might have the kids might have. And I\u2019m not sure why she has more onus than her older son or her daughter to let the younger son know what\u2019s going on. Because it sounds like the daughter found out from the older son, and the titles actually misleading to begin with she didn\u2019t take all of her grand children to Disneyland. She took her granddaughter, her daughter tagged along last minute and brought and paid for her own children", "That's mild AH but I can guarantee her grandson who's 6 didn't find out on Facebook. I bet the financially troubled father made it out to be a much bigger deal to his 6 year old. That child's father should have called grandma, talked it out, realized he couldn't afford to send his son, and sat his son down to explain why he couldn't go and hopefully he can go once he gets back on his feet financially.\n\nGrandma didn't tell him because she knew he would guilt trip her into paying for it by having his son call her crying begging to go. This is after the fact she's already given him money twice and knowing she can't afford it.", "The six-year old was going to find out eventually.His cousins would probably talk about the trip in front of him.", "As I said, they, not the six year old. It should have been discussed beforehand.", "I agree. Also, why is the 6yo crying for hours? It\u2019s not like the 6yo saw pics on SM. Did the father TOLD the 6yo and hurt his feelings?
