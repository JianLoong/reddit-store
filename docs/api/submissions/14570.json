It's entirely your fault and your responsibility. I hope your roommate leaves the hell right on our of your house. YTA. A giant, sweaty, hairy one that just came out of a swamp in the deep south. In July.", "As someone with cats, I make sure to tell everyone I live with that if they bring flowers to the house they have to be cat safe, or at the very least they have to be kept somewhere that my cats don\u2019t have access to. I don\u2019t expect other folks to research this stuff on behalf of me and my cats. If after I inform them of what plants are cat safe and which aren\u2019t, they proceed to bring toxic plants/flowers into the house, then they are assholes. But it\u2019s on you to bring it to their attention and be vigilant for the sake of your pet in the first place. YTA.", "YTA. You allowed plants in your home, you needed to satisfy yourself that they were safe. You're the responsible person for the cat.", "Did you even think of paying your roommate for the lilys that your cat ate? \n\nYTA", "YTA- you knew the plants were there, you didn\u2019t tell her she couldn\u2019t have the plants in the house, and the cat belongs to you. It is your responsibility to know what is and is not toxic to your animal.\nIf she had an accident and dropped something on your cat and caused an injury, I would agree with you, but this one is on you.", "YTA--this wasn't a violation of the lease. Evicting them would almost certainly be illegal. They would be able to sue you and would likely win a significant amount of money, which they would deserve. \n\nThis was your mistake, not theirs. If you think the vet bill was expensive, just wait until you see how much lawyers cost, or what double or triple damages for an illegal eviction looks like.", "YTA - you\u2019re an irresponsible cat owner. That\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but your own.", "NTA, but don't expect her to pay, rather insist that she move out sooner rather than later.\n\nIf she's living with you as a favor, (as the extremely discounted rent would indicate), then she should be considerate of the well-being of any dependent residents including children or pets.\n\nThere are so many things that can harm pets ranging from choking hazards to sugar-free products, and it doesn't sound like she's going to make the effort to avoid leaving them about.\n\nHer argument about it being unfair to her is a huge red flag.", "nta-For the person saying you should verify what plants are there, they are not your plants.   She brought the plants into your house not you, kick her out.", "Yeah sorry that happened to your cat but YTA. As a pet owner, you have to make sure your cat isn\u2019t affected by plants or various things around the house, and if it is then you need to remove those items or ask your roommate to put them in her room. \n\nAlso, this doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to obvious things. Like my answer would be different if your roommate left medicine on the floor or somewhere the cat can reach it cause that\u2019s careless of anyone who lives with a pet. My brother left a weed joint out once and my dog ate it and got very sick, I was pissed as hell and that was definitely his fault cause who the fuck leaves a joint of weed lying around when there\u2019s a puppy (or even a baby for that matter) in the house? But these plants were not something that were known to be obviously toxic, if you had known they were toxic, you should\u2019ve asked her to get rid of them before.", "\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc6", "Yep. \n\nThis wasn't \"an accident caused by [Rose]\". Rose isn't the one who allowed OP's cat access to toxic plants. This was an accident caused by OP, who didn't think to check the plants her cat had access to, gave her cat access to those plants *anyway*, and is now just trying to divert blame because she doesn't want to acknowledge that *she* was negligent. \n\nEspecially because lilies are to cats what chocolate is to dogs. If you own a cat, you should be aware of the fact that lilies can and will kill them. Ignorance isn't an excuse when *you're* the owner. Either do your due diligence to keep your pet safe & healthy or accept the responsibility for failing to do so and having to pay hundreds of dollars in vet bills.", "And it\u2019s so easy to identify a plant & look up if it is toxic to cats if you have an iPhone. If you take a photo of a plant or flower, the image will ID it and link to a search on it.", "Orrr the roommate paying EXTREMELY cheap rent of 250 a month, who chose to bring the plants into the home, should have done the research? She wanted the plants, she knew there was a cat around. The post implies both parties had no idea that lilies were toxic, so why is the onus on the pet/house owner to do the research for plants she never would have had in the home in the first place if not for the roommate?", "This. YTA.", "but \u201cmaking sure every plant is cat safe\u201d requires some sort of communication from the roommate, saying \u201chey I bought a new plant\u201d or \u201chey I moved my plant to the back porch\u201d. \n\nWe don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case, most people don\u2019t ask permission before moving a plant even if they\u2019re the tenant.\n\nIt seems unreasonable to expect OP to do a routine check on if any new plants have entered a cat accessible space", "I think this is all that needs to be said, case closed.", "Agreed. Kindness goes a long way. I would also do it because $250 rent is CHEAP and the vet bills will be way cheaper than the rent Rose is going to have to pay. OP def needs to learn from this that she needs to make sure she creates a safe environment for her kitty though.", "It\u2019s Easter lilies that are super toxic to cats. The room mate probably bought it a week ago and the OP may not have even noticed a new plant came into the house. Is she supposed to ask her room mate every day if she bought anything new into the house so she can go research the item?", "YTA. It's as simple as this: *Your* cat equals *your* responsibility. You are like a \"parent\" to your cat so it is your responsibility to make sure an environment is safe for them. Thus, being your responsibility to care for your cat, you have to pay for their medical bills whether it was an accident or not.", "Agreed. OP owes her a plant.", "Tbf if I move in with someone who has a cat I would expect the owner to know which plants are poison to cats.  Because I recently got a kitten (Moxley) but before that I never knew cats csn die from eating plants and I'm in my 30s lol. \n\nBut I would think every cat owner knows cats can get fatally sick due to eating plants.

Why would the roommate look up the toxicity of plants when she doesn\u2019t have a cat? \n\nOP should have included something in the lease about what plants weren\u2019t allowed in the space the cat has access to but she didn\u2019t. If she had or, at an absolute minimum said \u201cyou\u2019re responsible for ensuring all plants you bring here are safe for cats,\u201d there might be an argument for the roommate to be responsible for the vet bill.\n\nSince nothing like that happened, it was just an accident and the OP is responsible to pay for her cat\u2019s care.", "This!!! I have cats, I don\u2019t know plants at all, but since I live alone I just don\u2019t have plants. If someone is coming to stay I ask everyone to check plants before they bring them. When in doubt, just don\u2019t bring flowers.", "This is the only answer that makes sense! How would OP know what plant is what? I don\u2019t know plants at all and I would expect my friend not to bring deadly plants into the house. \n\nNTA-as long as you are legally evicting her.", "FYI, most people who don't have cats know NOTHING about what is toxic to cats.", "Bad take he\u2019s the owner and he didn\u2019t even know they were lilies because he didn\u2019t bother researching what plants were around his animal or telling her you can\u2019t have these type of plants. Why is she supposed to know more than what he\u2019s telling her. Ive had cats most of my life but didn\u2019t have plants or flowers and I didn\u2019t know lilies are toxic until I got my own place and wanted to start a garden, then I researched it", "Thats like saying If i live with someone who has a kid and I leave a gun out, or drugs in my room.   The roommate purchased plants without doing the research, and how is the OP supposed to know every plant that she brings in?", "Being ignorant of what plants are potentially dangerous to cats is fine when you don't own a cat, and have not taken on the responsibility of caring for a cat.\n\nBut ignorance of what plants can kill cats is not okay when you do own a cat and did take on the responsibility of caring for that cat. \n\nRoommate does not own a cat, did not agree to care for OP's cat, and is not responsible for monitoring any potential risks to said cat. OP, however, does, did, and is.", "Because it is her pet. She should know what to keep her pet away from.
