Her responsibility to know what the cat can and can not have. If she had a toddler that was allergic to peanuts, she would put in the lease \u2018no peanuts!\u2019  If you don\u2019t own pets, it doesn\u2019t even cross your mind that they could or could not have certain things. The owner could have looked up a list and simply told OP, \u2018you are getting plants but please exclude these to keep the animals safe\u2019 and the roommate probably would have no problem with that.", "That would be outside of the home.", "The third paragraph *does* actually say that renal failure is guaranteed:\n\n\"Some cats appear to be more susceptible than others are to lily toxicity. **The severity of the resulting kidney failure also varies from cat to cat.** Some poisoned cats recover with minimal therapy, while others require costly dialysis to live long enough for the kidneys to possibly repair themselves.\"\n\n*All* cats *will* experience kidney failure to some degree if left untreated for over 18 hours. It's just not *always* deadly. It seems that the susceptibility bit is explicitly referencing speed/severity of kidney failure and recovery potential, but kidney failure in some capacity *is* still a guaranteed result if untreated. \n\nThat being said, the mortality of cat lily consumption is 50-100% if early, aggressive medical intervention is not acquired.", "I remember that Simpson's episode", "People who let their cats outside to roam freely are the assholes.", "It was an educational plug not a sit-down shitting.", "I see nothing wrong if it's an area the cat can't actually get out of and roam free. You're making it sound like she's letting the cat roam the neighbourhood. I think it's nice to let them breathe fresh air and see outside.", "agreed. As someone who doesn't own cats, it would not cross my mind that they may be poisonous. It never crossed my mind until a couple years ago when I bought a monstera from someone who was getting rid of it because their cat kept trying to eat it.\n\nIt isn't the non cat owners responsibility to be aware of these things, plenty of people don't do pets and are not educated on what is okay and not okay. OP as the pet owner should have been aware and set house rules from the get go. OP was the irresponsible pet owner, not even KNOWING that some of those plants could be poisonous. If OP didn't even think to ask, why would someone who doesn't have a cat?", "Agreed. I come from a dog family but my gf has a cat and I've learned to like her cat and I've mentioned that once a month I'll be driving and a cat will bolt across the street and sometimes I see it as a collar or without one but little fat more or less indicating owners let them outside and I will come close to running one over since they bolt across the street", "Not when you allow your roommate to bring toxic plants and put them on the porch."]}
