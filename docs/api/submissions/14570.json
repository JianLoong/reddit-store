The only thing blood cells love more than antifreeze is alcohol.", "Weed whacking won't kill them.  They are next to immortal.  Dear friend stopped weed whacking his yard of lilies because it almost seemed to make them stronger.\n\nTough, tenacious flowers.  My favorite.  I miss them, but I'd miss the cats more.", "Exactly. I love plants and I make sure that I don't bring anything toxic into the home, because Goblin will chew on any plant he can reach. Rose lives with a cat, and brought plants into the home - it's on her to make sure those plants don't kill the animal whose tenancy precedes hers.", "> Nah but if I lived with animals-- especially ones that like to munch plants-- I'd check and see what plants are toxic before buying any.\n\nSee, I feel like that makes sense... If you already know that some plants might be toxic to animals. But that seems like a very specific thing to know to check.", "that still doesn't work, cause if the toddler does manage to get into that, it's on the parent for not watching their child.....if someone's not actually responsible for the kid, it's not their job to make sure they can't get into anything dangerous. the roommate wouldn't be responsible for putting child locks on the cabinets, or bumpers on corners, that's the parent's job. the parents of this hypothetical child would be solely responsible for researching how to childproof their home, including talking to their roommate about moving the plants out of reach. \n\nit's the same with OP's cat. it would be nice of the roommate to research everything they do to make sure it's safe for OP's cat, but it's not a requirement. whereas OP, the cat's guardian, should be aware that lilies are deadly to cats. they're very common, very easy to identify, and a very dangerous plant for cats. i've seen them in a lot of bouquets, as houseplants, and in yards too. but i haven't seen many cat owners that are unaware of how dangerous they can be.", "that's different, because you're aware that gluten will harm you, and communicate that to anyone that comes in. OP, however, didn't know that lilies were unsafe, because they didn't look into it, and so nobody was aware that they should be moved. why is it that the roommate is at fault for not knowing what plants are safe for a pet they don't own or take care of, but the pet's actual guardian is not responsible for knowing if the items in their home are safe. \n\nthis is more like if OP discovered they have a severe allergy when trying some of the roommate's food, and then sent the roommate the ER bill.", "Nope not her responsibility to do research the pet owner should already freaking know and let their tenant know that lilies are forbidden from the house and explain why. Not everyone knows the connection between cats and lilies which is why it's important that *the owner* does the research so that they can properly educate those that come into their house.", "Weed wacking would make it worse because it's hitting them and essentially throwing pollen around.\n\nIt's the same idea that you really shouldn't weed wack or pull weeds just cut at the bottom and spray", "It is when the person can evict you. You agreed to be a roommate to a person who has a cat. If you don\u2019t want to be evicted you need to be knowledgeable on things that can harm them. I only know this cause I buy my girlfriend flowers and need to know. If someone never has flowers why would they know? If it was the roommates cat I\u2019d agree they shouldn\u2019t let them roam wherever. The owner/main tenet should take priority over a roommate though.", "Yes and ironically the Austrian wine scandal didn't actually hurt anyone, but Italy had a much bigger antifreeze wine scandal a few years later that killed some people and yet their wine industry came out of it relatively unscathed. \n\n(I also live in Vienna and am a sommelier, Austrian wine is great)", "Finally a comment a fully agree with. Yes cat owner should be vigilant of things that could harm the cat, but the roommate should also be vigilant of what they're bringing into the home they're being very kindly allowed to stay in. It's not just OP's fault the cat got ill as most people here are trying to argue...", "the plant being the tenant paying next to nothing in rent who isn't willing to give an extra $100 to keep her tenancy, right? i mean it was an accident. i would feel terrible about almost killing my friends cat. this is the sort of thing that you should take responsibility for.. i dont believe that a plant enthusiast has *no* idea what plants are dangerous for cats/dogs/etc. the roommate doesn't seem to care at all. i wouldn't want a person like that around my pet.", "Assuming OP is in the US, for 250 she pretty much is lov6ing they're for free, that rent is astronomically cheap, it probably barely covers the cost of utilities. The average rent for an apartment in the US looks to be around 1,300-1,700, and depending on just where OP lives it could be way higher.\n\nAlso regardless of what the owner said or didn't say, I would have still made sure the plants were pet safe. It's just the same as with children, you wouldn't keep toxic plants around kids bc they're gonna stick it in their mouth; you're things make sure what you have is safe. Same thing applies to pets.", "It\u2019s hard to inform yourself of something you didn\u2019t even know was a possibility. We recently had to euthanise our cat whom we\u2019ve had for almost 18 years. He hasn\u2019t chewed or eaten any of our houseplants during all of the time we had him. And my mom would have poinsettias during Christmas and such. Now in hindsight I know that it was very risky and I do feel bad about it, but I didn\u2019t know until I saw it here on Reddit a few months ago that lilies and poinsettias and such were toxic to cats. Never struck my mind because our cat never showed even the slightest of interest in our plants. \n\nSo if the roommate didn\u2019t even know that the cat eating houseplants was a problem she had to consider, how was she supposed to educate herself about it?", "It is not our bussiness what kind of deal they agreed on about rent. They both agreed on the price and it seems they are satisfied with it. \n\nIt is an ESH situation. They both made mistake from which they will hopefully learn. Roomate should had used common sense and checked in with OP which plants could be harmful to her cat (from the post it seems that she did not but a new plant but already had quite a fair amount with her).  OP neglected possible harmful situations by bringing in roomate, did not set boudaries, did not check if living arrangement is safe for her cat.", "That's fair, and I can agree with ESH. \n\nI think the thing that doesn't sit right with me is that Rose refused to help pay the vet bills, I understand finances being tight but if I caused a vet bill I would at least try to do a payment plan to help pay for half the bill.\n\nI hope it resolves amicably for the both of them though"]}
