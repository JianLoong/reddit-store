The nurse either needs a reminder to not do it again or needs a more severe punishment because she did it again.", "More facts are needed.  What does his paperwork say?  Is his mom listed as a person he consents to have medical information?  It is unreasonable to expect one fact to be withheld by the staff if she can access the rest.  That isn't how HIPAA works.  I'd also check to see if old consent forms are lurking in the hospital computer.  My instinct would be to approach the nursing supervisor with that question - \"I'm worried that an old consent form meant that nursing staff thought is was ok to disclose medical information to his mother.\"  A roundabout question like that might get results without creating a formal complaint.  It's possible that a nurse made an assumption or even an intentional disclosure (because his mom DESERVES to know!)  Unfortunately, I have run into that with my mother, who was not supposed to have access to my information but could wheedle and smarm the staff.  Even though I was in my 40s and had my husband around as my advocate.

Your commentary about the usefulness of my question is unnecessary and unnecessarily rude.", "Well like I said I\u2019m in the UK - it would get investigated.", "You may be a nurse in the us but you\u2019re certainly not familiar with the practices in your hospital. If you are and this goes overlooked keep reporting it up. And up. And up. Until someone cares. \n\nThis shit is important. \n\nMost hospitals tie this to nursing leadership, physician leadership, staff nurses, and ancillary staff involved in performance improvement. Weekly. A crying nurse in a manager\u2019s office is sad in the first place, but this is a big issue. Through quality assessments, patient risk, and safety improvement it will be reported through to med directors, chiefs, presidents, legal if it\u2019s a big facility. There\u2019s a lot that goes on beyond making nurse who made a mistake cry. The US has plenty of awful healthcare issues, no doubt. But no changes will be made with a blas\u00e9 attitude like that.", "How likely is it that a nurse would even do this?", "Investigated how?  You think policy would change?  It\u2019s always been policy and law.

THERE ARE ALREADY RULES IN PLACE FOR THIS.  The one specific nurse went against policy.  It\u2019s not a leadership problem.

It\u2019s possible because like OP said, because there were a lot of different nurses taking care of him and the fact that he didn\u2019t want his info shared with her didn\u2019t make it to that nurse.  When the patient isn\u2019t married, their parents automatically have POA, but this person wasn\u2019t unconscious, could communicate his wishes, and didn\u2019t need a POA.  The nurse should have asked the patient if it was ok to share information with the person calling on the phone before telling her ANYTHING, especially because you can\u2019t verify who it actually is over a phone call.  The nurse messed up and their manager would have a meeting with them and could write them up, and if they want to based on what info was shared and the severity of the breech, could be reported to the Board for the HIPAA violation.  The correct thing to do would have been to say that they can talk to the patient themselves or take a message and tell him that his mother called to check on him and offer him a way to call her back if he wanted.", "Look that may be what happens where you work but it wouldn\u2019t where I work. We have a system in place so errors can be reported so we can learn from them. If it means a staff member needs re-educating or retraining then that\u2019s will happen. But at the end of the day an error was made. That needs to be reported because the next error could be fatal.\n\nAnd yes only by reporting errors or near misses can we identify if there is a failure in the policy. If there is then it gets changed. We have healthcare governance and CQC who specialise in this. Loads have been written on the Swiss cheese effect with near misses and failures in regards to errors. They must always be reported.", "Thank you.  May I ask also:  what role does the gf have in this?

This is what I suspected.  Not sure what OP hopes to achieve here.", "Absolutely NTA!! This is a major breech of confidential information. Who knows what might be exposed next.  \nI had something similar happen at the doctor's office. My father was having surgery and my parents had been keeping it a secret.

I asked an \u201cinfo\u201d question about this below to find out.", "That\u2019s interesting!  No one questioned the fact that my best friend was my person when I had my surgery.

No one missed your point. You did not say that if he made the request, he should be the one to report it. You said she didn\u2019t have the right to make the request to withhold information from his mother.\n\nThat said, unless she\u2019s listed as his healthcare proxy,  you would be correct that she would have no authority to make the request.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that the request should not have been necessary. The nurse violated HIPAA by discussing his medical history with his mother without his consent. The only time that is allowed is in a life or death situation when a medical decision needs to be made.\n\nAnyone with knowledge of this violation can report it.\n\neta:  This whole situation could be moot if the mother is on an approved list, i.e., she\u2019s his proxy.", "To your first sentence- yea, I agree- especially if your hospital isn\u2019t doing anything. Get a lawyer. Take on the hospital. Seems dramatic, but okay. Whatever creates change. Big proponent for prevention over reaction myself.\n\nWhat\u2019s simpler? Cheaper? More apt to make a difference? Internal processes FOR change. Like the ones I listed above. \n\nFiring one nurse won\u2019t make lasting change. Depending on the issue, firing a nurse for making a serious, but not unheard of, mistake won\u2019t do anything but destroy. The unit. The ward. The team. It fucks it all up. \n\nThe thing is I believe someone, somewhere in the chain of command fucking cares. What gets otherwise meh management going are SOLUTIONS and a paper trail. Got a problem with staff not observing confidentiality? One option: Put a lock (or whatever is your facility\u2019s process cause they likely have someTHING) on the chart- requires intention to enter it and use that chart. Whatever gets missed in report (because code blues happen, transporting patients requiring resources happen, a float nurse covering a midshift nurse going to lunch HAPPENS) can have backup measures. For directors or managers, they\u2019re only as good as their last fix, their last met metric, other behind the scenes stuff.\n\nI digress; present solutions to prevent issues in the future to an upper (no greater person to solve the problem than someone who fights said problem everyday- what could work better??), create a paper trail in case that doesn\u2019t see any type of solution, and continue escalating it. That One Nurse is a bullshit scapegoat situation and if you\u2019re practicing somewhere that abuses it- time to go. Your license and worth ain\u2019t worth it."]}
