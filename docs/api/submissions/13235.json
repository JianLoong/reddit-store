For one why was you being getting easily sick valid but her daughter getting sick has to be a lie? Second, you ... purposefully threw up on her. how can you be not the asshole by that, it's just incredibly spiteful. You were perfectly capable of going around her but just didn't want to?", "YTA. Everything is wrong but that's just gross and will always make you an asshole. \n\nI don't understand calling her poor. You're sitting next to her. It's not crazy for her to want the seats she paid for. Did you not have a bag? Why did you fly at all if you didn't have an aisle seat, a bag, and you know you get sick? You'd rather throw up on a person than your bag? I just feel like you should never fly at all.", "YTA you sound entitled. You are judging them when they tell you they don't want to move. You should have booked a seat. The next thing is that if you know you get sick that you should have brought bags with you, or asked for one, and/or looked for one. Then also you didn't need to throw up on her and be angry that the woman with your throuw-up all over her gets an upgrade.", "Massive YTA- \n\nYou threw up on a poor lady because\u2026 your bag was under your feet and you didn\u2019t want it to be dirty??? Sure the attendant is also \u201cto blame\u201d because she didn\u2019t get you vomit bags, but come on, if the lady touched your butt on accident while you squeeze out, who cares? \n\nNo wonder your husband didn\u2019t want to go on a trip with your petty ass and shipped you off with your \u201cfriend\u201d instead\u2026\n\nAnd as someone who has ulcerative colitis, and needs a bathroom often, I bet the girl just was EMBARRASSED because her mom was telling a rude as hell stranger she needs to be able to get to the bathroom quickly.\n\n I bet if she gave up her seat you would have not let her get to the bathroom anyways, as a form of \u201crevenge\u201d or something", "YTA! I sympathise with getting travel sick but come on dude it's your problem to deal with! There were so many ways to prevent that like idk buying travel sickness tablets or telling an airflight assistant LIKE AN ADULT so they can get you sick bags or rearrange a seat for you closer to the bathroom. That woman might if been snarky but she paid for the seat just like you (AH move calling them poor wtf) and then to throw up on her then SCREAM at her in from of her child? Glad they got moved to first class away from disgusting people like you.", "YTA. Why didn't your husband book you an aisle seat? This is stupid. You choose your seat when you book.

If you didn't get up and thus threw up all over this poor lady, that's on you. You could've stood up and wiggled your way out, if she would've complained you could've said she literally told you to do it. \n\nHowever since you didn't do anything to even try to make it to the bathroom by yourself.

In the comments, you're repeatedly saying that your husband would've upgraded you, but he didn't and you were stuck back in coach with all the other poor people, meaning you are no better than anyone else.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the audacity to cuss her out as if it's her fault that you threw up on her.\n\nAnd the FAs didn't reward her behaviour, yes the nice thing of her to do would've been to let you out easily but she actually didn't do anything wrong.

Seriously chemist usually less then $5 for 6 travel sickness bags. You know you get air sick, buy them and take them with you.

I usually don\u2019t fly places, because I get air sick and hate traveling, but my husband paid for me and him to go on a vacation, before he got busy with work, so me and my friend went instead. \n\nMy husband forgot to tell me that he was going to upgrade to first class while at the airport, and since me and my friend didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t already upgrade, we were both in economy. I was stuck in a window seat, and Steven was a row behind me in the middle seat in his row. \n\nAs I said before, I get air sick. I throw up, and so I need to be able to sit in the aisle seat. A woman and her daughter (probably 30-35 and 13-15) sat in my row, her daughter in the aisle and her on the middle. I told her I would like to sit in the aisle seat because I get sick. She told me her daughter has a stomach issue which means she needs the bathroom in case of an \u201cemergency\u201d which I doubt. Her daughter looked guilty and wouldn\u2019t look at me, so I assume she was lying. Her mom also said she booked the specific seats they had so they would be near the bathroom, and have aisle seats, but to me it sounds like she was too poor to get better seats, and she wanted to be petty because I needed the aisle. \n\nSteven also asked the person who had the aisle in his row, who said they preferred his seat, so he didn\u2019t move. \n\nThe flight starts, and an hour or two  into the flight I feel sick. I woke up the woman who was asleep, and asked her and her daughter to please get up so I can get to the bathroom, because the woman was on the heavier side and I don\u2019t want my butt in her face, or her touching me. She looked at me upset, and asked me to walk around her. I said, \u201cno, I need you to get up, please do hurry, I\u2019m going to be sick\u201d she told me to just walk around her, and closed her eyes, which was incredibly rude. \n\nAt that point I was feeling extremely sick, and threw up on her. She gasped, and her daughter looked like she was about to cry. \n\nI told her \u201csee, you selfish b**ch? I told you to get up because I was sick, and you f***ing didnt. I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d A flight attendant came, helped clean up, and escorted them TO FIRST CLASS. I was horrified they were rewarding her behavior. Steven came to sit by me the rest of the flight, and I admit I was pissed off. \n\nWhen I told my husband he said the girl and her mom were at fault, but Steven and my parents say I should have just scooted around them or thrown up on the floor, but my bag was on the ground and I didn\u2019t want to get vomit on it. \n\nAITA even though they didn\u2019t listen to me when I asked for the aisle and even though they didn\u2019t move?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And they were probably taking out the fact they couldn\u2019t get better seats on me, because I told them i would be in first class and not bothering them but I didn\u2019t know my husband didn\u2019t already upgrade me, so I think they were upset I was going to be in first class but they weren\u2019t", "I took Dramamine before I got on the flight, it doesn\u2019t help.", "I get really bad entitlement vibes from this OP. She just caused others trauma, instead of puking somewhere else or just cleaning the bag. I bet her late grandmother is really proud of her for that one.", "Exactly my thought.  OP is an asshole for 10000 reasons already mentioned, but I would never travel with something so valuable/precious for fear of it getting lost or damaged.  But somehow I'm guessing the bag has more of a \"look at me and my expensive bag\" value for OP than a nostalgic one.  The gaze from the poor untouchable economy passengers probably already damaged it!  This bag was meant for FIRST CLASS!\n\nIt sucks that she had to wait for airsick bags after multiple requests, but I am amazed that she had the split second to think through WHERE to vomit (and decide all over the stranger was the best option), but couldn't feel sudden urge come on and decide to push past and RUN like a normal person.", "fr if she want to throw up why go all the way to the bathroom when there is a designated barf bag in front of you", "Couldn\u2019t agree more", "I don\u2019t see how I looked back because I told them before hand I get sick, asked for vomit bags (which I never got, even after I threw up) and then asked her to move so I could get to the bathroom and throw up. She was the one not cooperating and listening, and so I let her know that it was her behavior that made it happen.", "So.. Instead of going to get a bag yourself or getting one before everyone sat down, you waited an hour and a half on flight attendents (not doing their job fair enough) to get a bag? \n\nYou knew you were going to be sick. Before hand. What measures did you take before you got on the plane. If you knew you couldve mentioned needing a aisle seat before getting on the plane, or bringing a plastic bag yourself. \n\nOr ya know. Scooting your way to either the attendants to finally get a bag or go to the bathroom.  Either way, sorry to say but you come off as incredibly rude and egotistical in the post with the comments about the other woman's wealth which were completely unnecessary. I'm glad she got moved into first class for the hassle you created.", "Right, you only cared about yourself. \"I didnt want to puke on my bag but I am willing to puke on someone I am mad at for my own selfish reasons\". They owed you nothing and they were not the AH here. You and your husband messed up here. Take accountability and move on. Ya Nasty.", "> I didn\u2019t want to vomit all over the wall or my bag and legs,\n\nSo the better option was to VOMIT ALL OVER THEM?\n\nYeah - you did it on purpose.", "The more I\u2019m reading your comments, the more I\u2019m realising how selfish you are. You should have vomited on yourself or the wall before vomiting on another person.", "Move your bag. Kick it out of the way. Do *anything* other than vomiting on people because you're mad that they didn't give you what you wanted. You had plenty of time to get up & move it or yourself when you knew that you were feeling sick. I bring my own bags when I travel due to not knowing if one will be available. Given that you *know* that you get air sick, you should have planned ahead instead of making assumptions & demands.", "Still he didn't book you the aisle seat to begin with.

It's none of your business.", "That\u2019s BS. You travel with your husband you know what he\u2019s like. You know on your tickets what section and seat you\u2019re sitting in. If you didn\u2019t like your section, you could\u2019ve easily gone to the front desk and made arrangements to make changes. With your husband does.

That\u2019s even before the barfing happens.", "God, I hope you\u2019re an Internet troll because if you are a real person and you act like this in real life, that is infuriating", "Did you not check your tickets *before* getting on the plane? You literally could have upgraded them yourself since you don't need your husband to do that. Also, why would he wait to upgrade at the airport instead of just booking them at the beginning since you talk as if you're not \"poor\". None of this makes sense. \n\nYTA, entitled, snobby, & judgemental with how you jump to conclusions without evidence while also looking down on people because they won't give you what you want. \n\nThey were sent to first class due to *your* bad behavior btw. The flight attendant made the correct choice after how you abused innocent passengers for not bending to your demands. & no, your getting air sick isn't an excuse for how you behaved then & still are now. You could & should have went around, but you *chose* not to so you could vomit on them which is disgusting on your part. \n\nYou're lucky that you were in the air when you pulled this because they could have kicked you off for how ridiculously you behaved. You will be lucky if you aren't on a list now due to it, too. \n\nGrow up, upgrade your own seats if you feel entitled to first class, prepare for when you know you could get sick, stop being so entitled & judgemental, & learn that the world doesn't revolve around you & what you want.

What was your plan in that case?", "This is not true. A flight attendant would not create a biohazard situation by refusing to give you bags.", "Were there none in the seat backs? 9/10 they are there, and the 1/10 they have not been there when I got on a plane the seat next to me still had theirs. Maybe the flight attendant didn\u2019t bring you one because she told you you already had one? If she really refused to bring you one even after you threw up a couple hours into the flight, you or your friend should have gotten up, tracked them or another attendant down, and gotten one.  If the airplane seat didn\u2019t have one AND the attendant didn\u2019t get you one in time, you should have thrown up on YOURSELF. Then you would have had a huge basis for complaint and probably would have been the one moved up to first class.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you bring a bag if you knew you got air sick?

You are accountable for your situation, planning, and actions. You are despicable. Look in the mirror and see if you can sit with who you are and what you did. Your personality is ugly. I would never want to be near you either.", "Why would it bother them that you were going to be in first class if you weren't in first class?

If you were \"going\" to be in first class, you would be.", "Doesnt make sense why you didn't bother asking or checking if you were in first class when you booked in.

Plus if you're already asking this woman and child (who's feeling unwell) to move multiple times and saying \"I should be in buisness class (and not near you) \" funnily enough isn't going to make them any more considerate of you.

They absolutely deserved an upgrade, and you absolutely deserved to be ignored by the flight attendants afterwards.

There is NO ONE who would want to suffer this kind of embarrassment by vomiting on or even near someone. Even so, there's seats all around her.
