He can always decline if uncomfortable, and other people really don't matter.", "What kind of date involves bringing your adult daughter along? \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone will assume this is a date, I\u2019m a little confused why that\u2019s where both of your minds went. Opposite gender friends can go out to  eat together platonically, but it\u2019s especially clear it\u2019s platonic if it\u2019s not one on one. \n\nP might still be \u201craw\u201d a week after cremation, everyone grieves differently, and might not be up to see you both at that time. But I think you two should invite him out as a standing invitation if so, and bring him so food if he\u2019s not feeling up to being social and going out. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nImagine if all his opposite gender friends avoided him in fear of this assumption.  Give him the support he needs.\n\nAlso, you'll be there, so it will look even less like a date.", "NTA\n\nthat\u2019s cute that you want to support him, you all lost her and it will be nice to have someone feeling similar. He shouldn\u2019t see it that way, but make sure when I\u2019m inviting him to let him know that this is just friendly meeting. If other people will think something else, f them!", "NTA. So this guy can\u2019t ever go out to dinner until society thinks it\u2019s acceptable? He has to sit/eat alone with people dropping off food at his doorstep? You\u2019re awesome. Good vibes. The world is a lonely place if we let it be.", "NTA   He can say no. And if both of you are there it isn't very date-y", "NTA. You are asking him for a dinner because you care for him as a good friend. You are not asking him out for a date.", "NTA, anyone who sees it that way would be weird for thinking this. He is grieving and needs support, I can\u2019t think of anything better than to take him out somewhere and try to help him through it.", "Sounds nice to treat him to dinner. I have no idea what P would think. Backlash from gossip is a poor excuse to not to do a kindness. Mom worrying about it made me think she might have an interest in him and isn\u2019t admitting it. But my considering it as a possibility sounds isn\u2019t a reason to not invite him, like it\u2019s nice of you to do so. If mom has questions about her joining, then she should stay home to ease her own mind. Invite him and the two of you go if he accepts. NTA.", "YWNBTA\n\ni doubt he\u2019d even think of it like that, and would appreciate the gesture. even if he declines, at least he knows you\u2019re thinking of him and he\u2019s not alone. if your mum has made it clear several times that she\u2019s not interested in romantic relations anymore, no harm done.", "NTA", "NTA if everything relevant is in this post. Did your mother explain why she thought this sweet and thoughtful gesture for a grieving widower could possibly be inappropriate? Like did she make a pass at him before? I feel like there is no universe in which these facts as stated would create a weird scenario which makes me wonder if your mom is leaving something out.", "No YWNBTA or inviting him out to dinner immediately after the cremation.\n\nI assume \"lunch\" isn't possible immediately after the cremation because of some scheduling issue, but even if it's not, it would be a faux pax, not AH behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think if you are both there then it's much less likely to come across as an attempt at a date. Maybe when you invite him, tell him that you thought he might like the chance to get out of the house and to reminisce about his wife if he would like to, or just try to forget it and enjoy a meal with friends, which ever he needs.\n\nAnd if he says no, it will likely still help him a little that you asked, and you should feel free to invite him again later - grieving is different for everyone but not wanting to go out right now doesn't mean he won't welcome the opportunity later. If he says no, you might even want to tell him that it is a standing invitation and to let you know if / when he does feel up to it.\n\nBeing bereaved can be very isolating - people stop inviting the bereaved person because they don't know what to say or do, so it can result in them being left alone.", "NTA\nYou are friends. Going to dinner with a a couple of grieving friends does not mean anyone is trying to get together romantically.\n\nHe may want to be around people right now. He may not want to go out. Nothing wrong with checking in and seeing what he is up for though and letting him know you are around.", "NTA\n\nI think you and your mother asking him out to dinner a week later is perfect.  The grief might have begun to set in then.  Maybe.  \n\nDinner in a week will simply be supportive. All too many people drop off after a death. The funeral and wake, then nothing.  Go out a week later, then a couple of weeks after that, heck, make it a weekly thing.  Friends are good.", "You two are really over thinking this. You likely get this from your mother.", "NTA the support you give will mean more to him than any \u201cbacklash\u201d you could possibly receive.", "NAH.\n\nYou're doing a kind thing, but your mom is right that... it might look a bit like she was putting the moves on him.  (Which, although it'd be classless, wouldn't actually be \\*wrong,\\* necessarily.  P is a free agent at this point.)  \n\nIf she and P are on the same page of where their relationship will go from here, have mom come along and damn anybody who naysays you.  If OTOH P might misinterpret \"friendliness\" as \"trying to seduce him,\" maybe have this initial tagup without her.  You've got the rest of your lives ahead of you to meet.", "no she's never made any hints, friend wanted to go out to dinner before but with her cancer getting worse and the treatments tiring her out we had to cancel. Me and My mum feel as though taking P to dinner would be sort of in her honor.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see anything weird about this. I can\u2019t imagine that P would either. The newly bereaved are often pretty lonely because people outside of that grief don\u2019t know how to handle it. P might not be up for a meal out but maybe if that\u2019s the case you and your mom could offer to go over and cook something and just spend time together reminiscing and crying and honouring your friend.\n\nThe thing to be mindful of is that P might need other kinds of support more than a meal out. Or a meal in for that matter. So be prepared for that. But you and your mom sound like you\u2019re close to him and part of his support system so you\u2019ll both be able to assess it better since you know him.\n\nSo let P take lead on what/where/if he wants to go out or if he\u2019d prefer something at your or his home or what but definitely offer. He needs his people right now. You\u2019re doing okay!"]}
