My neighbor 36F invited me to her daughter's 6th birthday party, where I had to come in dressed up as Elsa from Frozen\n\nWhen I was away In the afternoon one of my neighbors visited my house. My mom and neighbor are somewhat close and in one of their discussions, my mom brought up my work. The conversation supposedly moved to her daughter's birthday and that she wanted to do something frozen related since its her daughter's favorite movie, and asked if I would be free that day to come in as a Frozen Character.\n\nWhen I came home from a friend's house my mom told me her conversation with the neighbor: she brought up the Birthday party, and I kinda shrugged and agreed since the neighbor offered 100$. I called my work and told them the situation, since my company is pretty lax with me I asked to borrow the Olaf costume. They told me that Olaf was reserved for a week, and said I could use the Elsa costume instead.\n\nI'm kinda used to dressing up as Princess characters, So i didn't feel too forced to wear the Elsa Costume. let me tell you that as a male, I have feminine features and jokingly talk to my friends about working at \"femboy Hooters.\"\n\nFastforward to the day of the Party, everything went well and I got multiple compliments on my costume. A few of my other neighbors were there and were surprised it was me.Come to the end of the party, I ask the Mother for my payment where she dumps the \"I am short on money right now, But you could take some leftovers and one of my daughter's presents\" I told her I needed the money and wasn't planning on taking her kid's gift. I felt pissed off and was about to walk home when I heard daughter crying and saw the Mother pull a toy out of her daughter's hand and try to offer it to me. I noticed a bunch of guests staring at me and the Mom. I felt so embarrassed and confused in the situation the Father came in and handed me a twenty the I just walked off. The day after I received a bunch of texts from the neighbor berating me and saying how selfish that i was for wanting payment. And it wasn't just from the Mom, another neighbor that attended texted me saying I should've done out of the kindness of my heart as a person in the neighborhood. I brought this up with my Mom and she was shocked and apologized to me since she told the neighbor about my job. After this event I feel like I cant take another offer from a close family friend or family member.

I maybe shouldnt have asked for payment that day and could have waited until they have money to pay me.

You were hired to perform a job, and it's entirely reasonable to expect payment for your services, especially when you agreed to attend the party for a set fee. You were upfront about your need for payment, and the neighbor's initial offer was $100, not a toy or leftovers from her daughter's birthday party.  \nIt's not selfish to expect compensation for your work, and it's unreasonable for the neighbor to berate you for wanting the agreed-upon payment. Additionally, it's essential for people to respect the boundaries and professionalism of a business transaction, even if you are also a neighbor or friend. You acted appropriately in the situation by refusing the gift and insisting on payment.  \nYour decision to not accept offers from close family or friends in the future is understandable, given this experience. It's essential for you to feel valued and respected for your work, just like any other professional.", "The verbal contract was you do the job in exchange of $100.  \nYou did the job. The mother try to pawn her debt on her child? She used unwilling witness to twist the situation into making you look like you would take the child's birthday presents? \n\nTell the neighbor you accepted a deal which included payment. It wasn't at any point until payment was due after the work done, that she tried conning you with left over food, and that she was the one offering her daughter present. Be really clear about being disgusted by that last fact to the point you didn't even knew how to react -as shocked. The appeal of the kindness of your hear as payment for your time and effort can fork the remaining $80 they own you for work done.\n\nNTA", "I have my own painting business and have had friends ask for paint work done for free because we are friends.

There is a name for what your neighbor did to you: she lied. She promised you payment and then refused the promised payment when you fulfilled your end of the deal. You are in no way the AH in this situation. \n\nAnd the neighbor is getting her friends to text you in order to bully you to back off - using peer pressure to get you to back off because she knows she is in the wrong. Doing it out of the \u201ckindness of your own heart\u201d should have been negotiated before hand, not after she had agreed to pay you. \n\nNot only should you press for payment, but you should let people know what she did to you so others don\u2019t fall into the same trap.", "NTA. Guess what! The whole neighbourhood just lost their access to you going to their parties in costume for cheap. Next time someone asks? \"Sorry, I don't do private bookings anymore. People keep demanding I work for free, and my boss won't appreciate me constantly undercutting them. Here's the phone number/website for the company I work for.\"\n\nIf people think that asking for massive favours and then not giving the agreed payment is fine, then those people should work a day without pay and see how *they* like it.", "NTA\n\nPeople suck. They expect things for free just because they know you. But in this case she not only expected a favor but also lied to you. She plainly hired you but then refused to pay the bill, using the neighborly favor excuse. If you want you could take her to small claims court and ask for the remaining $80.

And you had to use one of your company's costumes,  it did not belong to you? NTA!
