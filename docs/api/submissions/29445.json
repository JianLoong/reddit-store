My neighbor 36F invited me to her daughter's 6th birthday party, where I had to come in dressed up as Elsa from Frozen\n\nWhen I was away In the afternoon one of my neighbors visited my house. My mom and neighbor are somewhat close and in one of their discussions, my mom brought up my work. The conversation supposedly moved to her daughter's birthday and that she wanted to do something frozen related since its her daughter's favorite movie, and asked if I would be free that day to come in as a Frozen Character.\n\nWhen I came home from a friend's house my mom told me her conversation with the neighbor: she brought up the Birthday party, and I kinda shrugged and agreed since the neighbor offered 100$. I called my work and told them the situation, since my company is pretty lax with me I asked to borrow the Olaf costume. They told me that Olaf was reserved for a week, and said I could use the Elsa costume instead.\n\nI'm kinda used to dressing up as Princess characters, So i didn't feel too forced to wear the Elsa Costume. let me tell you that as a male, I have feminine features and jokingly talk to my friends about working at \"femboy Hooters.\"\n\nFastforward to the day of the Party, everything went well and I got multiple compliments on my costume. A few of my other neighbors were there and were surprised it was me.Come to the end of the party, I ask the Mother for my payment where she dumps the \"I am short on money right now, But you could take some leftovers and one of my daughter's presents\" I told her I needed the money and wasn't planning on taking her kid's gift. I felt pissed off and was about to walk home when I heard daughter crying and saw the Mother pull a toy out of her daughter's hand and try to offer it to me. I noticed a bunch of guests staring at me and the Mom. I felt so embarrassed and confused in the situation the Father came in and handed me a twenty the I just walked off. The day after I received a bunch of texts from the neighbor berating me and saying how selfish that i was for wanting payment. And it wasn't just from the Mom, another neighbor that attended texted me saying I should've done out of the kindness of my heart as a person in the neighborhood. I brought this up with my Mom and she was shocked and apologized to me since she told the neighbor about my job. After this event I feel like I cant take another offer from a close family friend or family member.
