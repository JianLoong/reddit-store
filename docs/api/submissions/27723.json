{"id": 27723, "submission_id": "16tgdkr", "title": "AITA for refusing to buy my ex's daughter a birthday gift?", "selftext": "My ex cheated on me for most of our relationship. I found out during my pregnancy with our daughter and he had the other girl pregnant too. My daughter was a June baby and theirs was an October baby. They also got married that following February. To say things between us have been tense is an understatement. Ex's wife didn't know immediately that he was with me, or that we had been together since we were 15. She hated me for overshadowing her own pregnancy with mine. She hated me even worse when she needed an emergency c-section and had so many complications that a hysterectomy had to be carried out. The tension between us all then was at it's worst. Ex's wife wanted me to give up my daughter for them to raise both girls together as \"real sisters\" and when I refused we had all the drama. I don't even think she would have been able to love my daughter had I done that. But I think she wanted more than one badly enough that she thought my daughter would do since she was already born.\n\nEx and I now communicate through an app mostly. We share custody of our daughter (14) and exchanges happen at school pick up time to minimize the contact between us. This has worked for many years, though I know not ideal for my daughter overall.\n\nMy daughter and her half sister have a very high conflict relationship. It's over me and ex's wife. Ex's daughter has picked up her mom's attitude toward me and dislikes me and believes I keep her sister from \"her real family\" and my daughter doesn't like ex's wife which annoys her half sister. This has been communicated to me a number of times by my daughter and also by my ex, who will send random texts about it. I never respond because our mandated communication is done through the app.\n\nEx and his wife had some financial problems over the last six month. For my daughter's birthday she got a card and a gift card and my ex told her in advance he wouldn't be able to get her much. I was able to get her a present as normal though. I splurged a little this year and got my daughter a gaming laptop. She was so happy. Ex became aware of this when my daughter spent a bit of time with her grandparents and she asked them if she could bring the laptop to their house. Ex asked her about it and she told him I bought it as her birthday gift.\n\nNow ex's daughter's birthday is a couple of weeks away and he wants me to buy her a gift, something I have never done before. He said the money situation is still tight and he doesn't want her to get nothing. I told him I would not be buying her a gift and he blew up the app and my phone saying I should be doing this so his daughter isn't left with a lackluster birthday. Ex said I had never done anything to help the dynamic with the girls and never cared about the pain he and his wife were in and this was one thing I could do.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695808674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tgdkr/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_my_exs_daughter_a/", "score": 1241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I might be TA is this is a 13 year old girl turning 14 and she might be lucky to get a gift card from how things sound. I could afford to get her something nice and it wouldn't put any strain on me. Maybe it would help her get along better with my daughter too. And I said no because I don't want to.

Is your daughter happy going to her dad's regularly? If not, it might be time to start looking into whether you should have full custody and he should pay child support instead. If she wants to keep the arrangement, maybe it's time to block his phone number and possibly look into a restraining order if he keeps harassing you outside of the app. The whole point of apps like that is you don't have to communicate anywhere else. Pretty sure him blowing up the app with unreasonable demands is also a violation of the terms. Whatever you do, I'd recommend some harder boundaries moving forward, because right now you're spending a lot of time dealing with someone else's circus and someone else's monkeys.", "Info.

Both of these people are so out of order they seem like cartoon villains. You're not crazy.\n\nThe only people you need to worry about are you and your daughter, and your parents if they don't have any relationship with your ex. I strongly suggest:\n- Block him on every point of contact except the mandated app.\n- When there are inappropriate messages from him to you on the app, don't respond. Forward them to your lawyer and ask for their advice.\n- Make sure your daughter is getting mental health support, and both you and her get support\n- Keep the channel of communication open between you and her so you know how she is feeling in her father's house. If she asks for a change in custody, listen to her.\n- Take a position of indifference towards her father. The most important thing about him is not that he's your ex, it's that he's her father. You can safely ignore everyone else in that house. You only need to care about how your daughter feels there, and talk her through situations, you don't need to know anything about his current partner or their children.\n\nNormally it would be a good thing to try to have a calm relationship with both families for the sake of your daughter, but past and present show that neither he nor his wife are capable of that.", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019d double down and buy your own daughter an even better gift around half sisters bday.", "Tell him to start working some overtime if he can\u2019t afford basic things for his daughter.", "nta i got angry reading this. the audacity", "NTA.

I found out during my pregnancy with our daughter and he had the other girl pregnant too. My daughter was a June baby and theirs was an October baby. They also got married that following February. To say things between us have been tense is an understatement. Ex's wife didn't know immediately that he was with me, or that we had been together since we were 15. She hated me for overshadowing her own pregnancy with mine. She hated me even worse when she needed an emergency c-section and had so many complications that a hysterectomy had to be carried out. The tension between us all then was at it's worst. Ex's wife wanted me to give up my daughter for them to raise both girls together as \"real sisters\" and when I refused we had all the drama. I don't even think she would have been able to love my daughter had I done that. But I think she wanted more than one badly enough that she thought my daughter would do since she was already born.\n\nEx and I now communicate through an app mostly. We share custody of our daughter (14) and exchanges happen at school pick up time to minimize the contact between us. This has worked for many years, though I know not ideal for my daughter overall.\n\nMy daughter and her half sister have a very high conflict relationship. It's over me and ex's wife. Ex's daughter has picked up her mom's attitude toward me and dislikes me and believes I keep her sister from \"her real family\" and my daughter doesn't like ex's wife which annoys her half sister. This has been communicated to me a number of times by my daughter and also by my ex, who will send random texts about it. I never respond because our mandated communication is done through the app.\n\nEx and his wife had some financial problems over the last six month. For my daughter's birthday she got a card and a gift card and my ex told her in advance he wouldn't be able to get her much. I was able to get her a present as normal though. I splurged a little this year and got my daughter a gaming laptop. She was so happy. Ex became aware of this when my daughter spent a bit of time with her grandparents and she asked them if she could bring the laptop to their house. Ex asked her about it and she told him I bought it as her birthday gift.\n\nNow ex's daughter's birthday is a couple of weeks away and he wants me to buy her a gift, something I have never done before. He said the money situation is still tight and he doesn't want her to get nothing. I told him I would not be buying her a gift and he blew up the app and my phone saying I should be doing this so his daughter isn't left with a lackluster birthday. Ex said I had never done anything to help the dynamic with the girls and never cared about the pain he and his wife were in and this was one thing I could do.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
