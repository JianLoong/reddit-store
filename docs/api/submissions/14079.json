They put their selfish desire to live a fantasy over your sisters wellbeing.\n\nSorry for the rant but adoptive parents who do this make me furious, and so does anyone who thinks YTA because adopted children owe their parents for raising them and so you or your sister going against them is \"disloyal\" or \"ungrateful\". You weren't wrong for telling your sister, and she wouldn't be in the wrong for never trusting them again.\n\nIf anything I'd question if its the right choice to gatekeep your mother's info from her. \n\nI'd say you should have told her sooner but that's not really fair when you were under their care etc.", "I know someone who found out she was adopted as an adult.

Maybe you should have talked with the older sister first, to try to preserve that relationship, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep this from E. Besides not wanting to lie to her, there are so many ways for her to find out. Her birth certificate might have the info on it or indicate that it\u2019s amended. She could find the court documents.

That does *not* sit right with me. EDIT: I see your adoptive mom choose not to tell your sister due to the pain of not being her biologically daughter, even though i understand, its a very selfish reason to make such a choice.  \nYou are quite lucky your sister is on your side, if she weren't, your adoptive stepmom would have kept you away from your sister.  \nI think you did well by choosing to tell your sister, also well done on protecting her and keeping her private information private.   \nAlso for not breaking the bond and trust of your little sister.

This is unfortunately quite common and there isn\u2019t much you can do to prevent it from happening, but the fact that they TOLD YOU THIS is infuriating. I am so sorry that you and your sisters had to deal with this. I am sure they provided you all with a loving and stable home, but that does not excuse how they approached adoption and parenting.

People's obsessions with biological children never made sense to me and the way you foster a good relationship with anyone is one rooted in honesty and mutual trust. \n\nBut Elizabeth is still a minor.

I think the parents are evil for how they treated the OP. I think that him being honest with her, IF THE INTENTIONS WERE HONORABLE, is genuinely good. But I don't think the intentions were honorable.

OP is an adult. As an adult, he is responsible for his own actions. He \\_DIDN'T\\_ tell his sister when he was a kid. If he wasn't able to keep this big, important secret as a child, that would've been totally understandable. If he was 16, and his sister was 9, and he was posting this, I'd be 100% N/T/A on this, because he'd have done it as a kid. But he didn't. He kept the secret his whole childhood, and then 5 years into his independent, adult life. Only now, when he's tracked down his bio mom, his sister is at a really vulnerable age, NOW he tosses this hand grenade into her life when he can be held completely responsible for his own actions and be expected to understand the consequences. There's a gulf of difference here.\n\nI am very explicitly not justifying the adoptive parents, because what they did was VILE. To expect a child to keep a lie that big from their own bio sister, the one person they could have shared feelings with and had understand them, was horrible. It ensured that OP was isolated. The fact that they then told him outright that they only adopted him because it was a package deal? Holy shit, fuck those people. That's outright evil. So do not conflate my judgement with any sort of justification of their actions. That's why I edited the judgement.\n\nThat does not, however, justify him blowing up his sisters whole world, out of the blue, for no real reason, when she can't even get anything out of it. He's shattered her fragile little world, at basically the most fragile time in development where a person is rebelling and trying to establish a firm sense of self. He undermined her whole foundation, and he did it because he has a (WHOLLY justified) chip on his shoulder about the adoptive parents. She is basically collateral damage in this, and the worst part is she isn't even allowed to know her bio mom and learn anything of value out of this. He just grenaded her world, to feel better himself, and his sister only gets hurt by everything. THAT is why I have a problem with the OP. Not because I think the adoptive parents are anything other than the cruel, and inhuman trash they are.", "\"no real reason\" the reason is that he was in contact with their bio mom which adds another layer of lying. If I found out my sibling had been keeping that from me for two years it would take me much longer to forgive them. \n\nEdited for clarity", "Right? It's one thing to blow up this kid's life with this information, but now you're going to not tell her about her bio mom for another 2 years? How do you think this is going to play out, when she finds out that you've had a relationship with your bio mom this entire time and not let her know about or even be a part of it?!? What do you think your relationship with her is going to be like then?\n\nYTA, there are no altruistic reasons here for giving her this information, you did it simply out of spite because you weren't the favorite child. Which, by the way, wasn't her fault yet you're now making her pay the price for it.", "Um, okay, that was... Badly worded. Maybe \"no justifiable reason\" is a better way to state it. The issue is he legally cannot give her the biomom's info and get them in contact, so she's now stuck living in limbo for the next two years, or the OP is risking the parents pressing charges against him (and it sounds like those vile piles of human waste would do it in a heartbeat).\n\nSo even if he genuinely had the best of intentions, and I still think this smacks of being a bit too self serving for that, he's now punishing and hurting his sister for the next two years before he can legally repair any of it... Or having to rely on the original liars to decide to fix it for him, which seems unlikely.\n\nI am dubious of his intentions, but I am rock solid in my feelings that he has unnecessarily hurt his sister, with no real remediation available, and that's just cruel to her. Hence me saying ESH. The adoptive parents are human trash for how they treated the OP, but he hurt someone who is totally innocent in this for reasons that really feel to me like they are selfish, and that's also asshole behavior.", "The very justifiable reason is that he is currently in contact with their mother. I don't understand why you don't see that it would be a huge betrayal to be in full contact with his biological mother and not even tell his sister that she was adopted. \n\nI was adopted in a closed adoption so legally I wasn't allowed to contact my birth mother until I was 18, but my parents still told me I was adopted and if I'd had any older siblings, them lying to me about being in contact with that birth mother would have been an extra violation on top of the previous lies. At least this way she has time to process the information that she was adopted before she even has to confront the idea of whether or not she wants a relationship with her bio mother.", "I see it as now the sister has two years to come to terms with it and figure out what she wants to do when she turns 18.", "Lies hurt more than the truth, they just take longer to get there. Yeah, he's been lying to his sister for 16 years now, he could've come clean at any moment, but when you've been going that long it's hard to break the cycle. There's always a reason to just continue as you had before. He broke the cycle, and he should be applauded not berated. She deserves to know the truth, she deserves to decide who she wants to continue to trust. Her adoptive parents are responsible for the damage this causes at 16 years old, not her brother. This doesn't get better or easier in 2 years, it gets harder and more painful. While you could be right regarding his intentions, and yes, his intentions could still be assholish; but I think you're only seeing the pain she's in right now, and not realizing that it would've been just as bad (or worse) if he continued kicking that can down the road.

I wanted to at the very least ask my bio family if I needed to watch out for any hereditary diseases and ask my mother face to face why she abandoned me.

This way she has at least two years to decide . (Although, I'm pretty sure a closed adoption only legally binds the adoption agency from handing out biological families information, you never signed an NDA or at least I didn't. And I've heard of many teens that had closed adoptions use private investigators to find there biological families information before 18). But that's actually probably a good idea to let her digest the information for a year or two . you should provide info about the kinda of person ur bio family is as a scout for her and let her decide for herself if she really wants/needs that connection when she comes to terms with how she feels.

Aside from the fact that I just don't agree with keeping adoption a secret on general principle, it could have serious medical implications. What if she needs a transplant and doesn't match with anyone in the family (except maybe OP)? Or she develops a health condition that runs in her biological family, that she could have been aware of? As someone with a genetic predisposition for everything but breast cancer, knowledge really is power.\n\nAnd who's to say she doesn't one day find out, even in a more innocuous way, that she has a blood type she couldn't possibly have inherited from her adoptive parents? Would they rather she find out that way?", "Your parents are clearly in the wrong and your sister definitely should be told. However the question is valid. There are better and worse times and ways to make such a huge reveal, which can be a major shock and many adoptees take badly. \n\nThe question is whether you were the best person and this was the best time. You did give your parents the opportunity, and it really should have come from them, but they refused. So while you may or may not have been the best person, you were the only person. Definitely not TA for that. \n\nThe timing, though, is more problematic. The worst time to find out something like this is early to mid teens, since it is a major stage of identity formation, as well as a stage of gradually developing the independent self within the context of family. This could really cause issues for your sister. I assume you didn\u2019t know that and didn\u2019t intend to hurt her, and maybe you didn\u2019t (people vary, reactions vary). But you took it upon yourself without understanding the potential consequences and that was wrong. It most likely would have been kinder to wait a bit longer, since it\u2019s gone on this long. \n\nI won\u2019t call you TA - that belongs to your parents.", "Sounds like it was more about you. Seems like you did something very selfish because of your own resentment.\n\nYTA", "how does she benefit from knowing this? as far as she knew she had a mother who loved her dearly, now she knows her actual mother actually didn\u2019t give a shit about her. how is she benefitting to \u201cknow where she came from\u201d great that your bio mom got clean, but no she\u2019s not a good person that is worth knowing", "You suck.", "Agreed, it's incredibly cruel! I absolutely resent people who push children into these positions instead of focussing on raising happy healthy kids who can have full childhoods. NTA", "Your adoptive parents are really selfish and self absorbed. This proves that they were more concerned with wanting a baby, than what was actually best for you and Elizabeth. I hope you've told her the whole truth about that, and what they said about not wanting you.", "Not forgetting that fact and I said what I said and meant that 100%. Next!", "Exactly this. I have a foster child who has multiple health conditions. They're all hereditary and all linked, but without knowing her medical history, the link between them could have been missed and diagnoses & treatment potentially delayed. With that info, I knew what to watch for and was able to push harder for assessments and get her into pivotal early intervention services.", "Also with a history of substance abuse", "Because in many places, both OP and bio mom can face criminal charges for attempting to contact a minor / providing information on a minor in a closed adoption case. OP's adopted parents sound exactly like the type who would pursue such charges as well.\n\nOnce you're a legal adult, that goes out the window.", "Because it was already too late! So yeah it needed to be done urgently.\n\nNTA - OP you are not at fault.", "No. Knowledge of a person's parentage is a *right*. In this case, the child wasn't *only* not told not told she was adopted... she was actively deceived on an ongoing basis. OP thought carefully about his decision, and he knows everyone affected far better than we do, including the sister in question. NTA OP", "I am also adopted. And personally, I prefer the truth. But I do understand the whole ignorance is bliss thing. I suppose OP could've tried to keep the lie going to the grave. But the sister could've also found out down the road anyway. Lots of people doing ancestry kits these days. The difference in finding out now as opposed to say when she's 32, is that at least this doesn't come with an *every last person* in your family has been lying to you for over 30 years.", "Yea, I remember my mom forced me to keep secrets about certain things like keep a secret from my dad about certain things my brother did when I was a kid. It sucked. I know it's not the same as this but still. I was manipulated into keeping said secret from my dad when I was 12.", "Yea, that's where it can become dangerous too.", "Good to know, thank you. I thought the closed info was to protect the privacy of bio parents, which wouldn\u2019t be an issue if she wanted to reach out. Appreciate your clearing up my misunderstanding.", "My mom had an near fatal accident on the highway, we didn\u2019t tell my sister for three days cuz she had exams. I think she had a feeling so she kept calling me and I kept pretending everything was fine and normal while sitting in the hospital. I still feel guilty about it and she still gets annoyed when we bring it up. \n\nPeople deserve to know. \nAlso my moms fine now thankfully \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: I kept telling my family members she should be told but everyone kept telling me to stay quiet for her exams. I hated lying to her and promised I would never do it to anyone after that.", "But you'd already waited 16 years...", "What I\u2019m gathering is that your situation is like a malignant tumour, it\u2019s sucks from every perspective and every hypothetical we look at it with .\n\nI don\u2019t envy your position OP.\n\nNTA", "She is 16. So what when she was 1. I absolutely agree she should have known. Like this cold shower? Probably not. Everybody, EVERYBODY! Lied to her. Again EVERYBODY and now she is getting the news in the worst way and worst time.", "Thanks for this response. I was getting annoyed at the other commenters badgering \"But why now? Why not earlier? Why not later?\"\n\nYou nailed it exactly on the head *Why Now.*", "I have never heard that saying about the tree but I'm stealing that thank you. Also OP is NTA, adoption is a very nuanced complicated thing, and until you've experienced it you can't really say anything.", "OP doesn't owe any loyalty to the adoptive parents who drove a gigantic wedge between their sister and them. They are siblings who went through tough time together, and adoptive parents literally tried to take it away from them. OP's loyalty is to the sister, and to the relationship they can finally have that is honest and open. I hope the damage of having to keep a secret of such magnitude will heal in time.", "I too am very confused why people don't forever maintain the same decisions they made when they were 6 at the behest of their parents. Doesn't everyone just mentally stay the same when they were easily influenced by their parents???", "There are so many resources. But parents have to care and do some work. One of my favorite books for the kids was Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born by Jamie Lee Curtis. \n\nWe celebrate family day for each of my kids. They love it. We are actually doing a home country visit for my oldest next summer. It will give her context and some closure.", "I have two separate friends that have adopted and they call it \u201cgotcha day.\u201d  Everyone knows they are adopted and are handling it totally well, because it was normalized, like you said.", "100% agree. The adoptive parents are vile. The OP owes them nothing at all.\n\nBut I think what he did caused a lot of harm to his sister that cannot be fixed for the next two years. I've explained in detail in another response, so I'll just snip a bit of that here to save some typing time:\n\n\"Also, I don't necessarily agree he did the right thing, even disregarding the motives. I think she deserves to know, 100%. But I don't think that him telling her in her current situation was good. I'm really unsure whether or not it was the best of only bad options, because there was no good way to handle this situation as given, but I really think that the OP caused her a great deal of mental and emotional trauma at a really fragile time in her life, in a way that offers no solutions or positive outcomes, and leaves her stuck waiting to make anything of it for two years. I don't think that is good, I think that is cruel.  \nHer adoptive parents are also cruel for lying to her her whole life and not giving her the opportunity to grow up with the truth, but two assholes don't make a right... It just makes two assholes. Or, well, three as each of her adoptive parents is one individually. Regardless of thinking that the OP did this for vengeful purposes, I don't think it was right of him to do this, either the way he did, or with no effectual recourse to fix the situation at all for her. She's just stuck, where it's illegal for her biomom to be in any form of contact with her for the next two years, at least going by what the OP said. That's a lot of what I feel so strongly about here. It feels cruel that he basically destroyed the stability of what she viewed as her real family, told them everything her whole life was a lie, and she doesn't even have the option of taking that info and choosing to put her biomom into her life to mitigate or repair the damage done to her life. She's now stuck in a place where she can't escape the parents that lied to her her whole life, can't replace any part of that broken bond with her biological mother to be able to put things together into a new normal, a new whole. She's left wounded and alone, and I could see feeling some resentment towards her brother who not only inflicted all this on her, but also gets to monopolize the actual relationship with their biomom for the following two years.  \nBut that's basically me, thinking about how I'd feel in that situation. That doesn't mean it's true for anyone else, it's entirely hypothetical for myself, and I can't know anyone else's perspective.\"\n\nSo yes, his loyalty absolutely should be with his sister. I am not convinced it is, however. I think he did her harm, knowingly or negligently, but at the very least knowing there is nothing allowed to be done to fix it. I think that was cruel.", "That wasn't my point. Certainly it's not his fault he was forced into it. I would not expect anything from a 6, or 10, or even 14 yr old. But there's been a bit of time after that until now, and I don't understand the urgency he's feeling now.", "NTA, given some added info, i am changing it to NTA. Basically op says in comments that the reason was because the adoptive parents didn't want to be reminded of the pain of them not being able to have another child. So it was all about them.\n\nIf the child had been the product of oh Hitler, I would say \"hell no do not tell the kid!\" But they don't want her to know because of their pain? Screw that, pain is life.", "NTA. I'm so sad for you. Your adoptive parents wanted to lie forever. They made it clear that they didn't want you and would only treat you okay if you kept up the lie. So, now that your sister knows, they cut you out. That's so messed up. \n\nMaybe they treated you okay growing up. They should have never told you that they didn't want you though.", "NTA\n\nYou were 7, removed from your mother, and placed with people that have explained that they wanted a baby, not a boy that has memories and the clear trauma of the separation.\n\nDid you ever go to therapy to address that trauma? \n\nAnd you have kept their secret for 16 years - despite what it did to you. \n\nYour adoptive parents will eventually figure things out, or not, but you, please, to to therapy, counseling, anything. You take care of yourself now.", "NTA: the situation your adopted parents put you in at just 7 yo is horrific. That and openly telling you they only agreed to adopt you cause they wanted a baby but it was a package deal is all sorts of wrong - not to mention treating you less than your other sisters. While they are the ones who chose to go LC with you, view this as a gift. Even if they acted as your parents for 20 years, no parent would ever put a child, let alone their own, through that experience just to play house with a baby. \n\nTo this day, I still am genuinely confused around the stigma and desire for couples to adopt and keep it a big secret from the child. Families come in all different forms, dynamics, and sizes. Fostering and adoption can be a wonderful thing for all. Unless the child\u2019s parents where abusive or in danger if the adoption where open - doing what they did and insisting the child NEVER know has a lot of red flags all over the place.", "NTA. But knowing the adoption is closed and legally no matter how she felt she couldn't do much for another 2yrs, I think you could have waited. Also you essentially destroyed your sister's relationship with everyone. And made the adoptive parents regret ever adopting you 2, they clearly wanted a baby who would never know about their adoption and if it wasn't for you being 7 they would have got their wish.", "NTA she needed to know and the sooner the better.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your adoptive parents are.  She should have been told the truth as a young child. Forcing you to lie about was cruel. There is no valid reason for keeping adoption a secret from a child. She may need to know for medical reasons at some point in time. She could find out through  an ancestry test. That would be quite a shock. This was unfair to both of you.", "NTA", "NTA. I am an adopted person. Your parents did your sister no favours by withholding this information, especially in the age of easy DNA testing. You did the right thing, even though it was unpopular. There is no shame in being adopted. There is no shame in being unable to have your own off spring. I thnk it's reprehensible to pretend a child is your own biological child when they are not. You might want to find some post adoption resources or support groups for you and your sister. The truth of who you are, who you are related to, and where you come from is YOUR truth to share, whether your parents  agree or not. It is NOT their truth. They don't own you. They have no say in who you tell you are adopted, including your sister. They are flat out wrong and have handled all of this poorly. I'm sorry.", "I\u2019m torn because while I agree Elizabeth needs to know, I also think you should\u2019ve tried it another route or attempt to talk to parents and Georgia to help tell her all together or on the same page. As long as you didn\u2019t do this for yourself versus Elisabeth NTA. I just wish for Elizabeth\u2019s sake something else could\u2019ve worked out :(", "ESH except the 16 year old", "Probably not the best timing on your end, but the only AH's here are your parents for making CHILDREN lie to their sister their whole lives, that was incredibly selfish of them.

Although I don\u2019t agree with your adoptive parents decision, it does come across as though it was a malicious act", "YTA\n\nYou have no right to tell her anything against your parent's wishes until she's 18. \n\nAlso what do you MEAN you were never treated as less than and you weren't on bad terms but you \"knew your place\" because they liked having a baby? Seems like you just made up this situation in your mind. They absolutely did not have to take you and did not have to raise you well just to get a baby.", "I\u2019m going to get Blasted for this, but: Going against the grain to say YTA. Sounds like you reconnected with bio mom, completely forgave her giving you both up for her addiction (I 100% apologize for this statement, but\u2026) and want your sister too, as well, so you can have her \u201cshare that\u201d with you. BUT, you seem like you did this b/c you\u2019re kind of pissed b/c you have to \u201cknow your place\u201d with the adoptive family, but sister doesn\u2019t. She is fully like a bio kid, while you\u2019re apparently not. (Tho, I take that with a grain of salt\u2026). You could have waited until she was 18, but you didn\u2019t, b/c I think you wanted her to know, having to wait for 2 years, and \u201chopefully\u201d have her start resenting your adoptive parents like you do. Also, your sister ISN\u2019T an adult like you, so the \u201cgetting to know her again as an adult blah blah blah\u201d, doesn\u2019t apply here. She is a CHILD that you knowingly \u201cripped away\u201d from her known family, and you did it for selfish reasons, imo. \u201cShe should know where she came from\u201d\u2026the adult with such bad substance abuse problems that her kids were taken away and placed in foster care?! Yeah, she\u2019s So Much better knowing that?? I think you\u2019re just resentful. I hope I\u2019m wrong, and you just want what\u2019s best for her, but I doubt it. I hope you\u2019re in therapy, as well as your sister now, too. Also, your bio mom had NO place wondering \u201chow to proceed\u201d. She gave up her rights to you Both.", "op=NTA\n\n1) NO child should be forced to make a promise like that. It's like expecting a child to make a legal contract--not acceptable.\n\n2) you gave them fair warning that you wouldn't be held to a childhood promise.  And gave them the option to tell her.  \n\n3) you aren't giving her the bio mother info until she's 18, that is a reasonable compromise.", "Honestly I think the person you need to ask is Elizabeth. How does she feel about knowing? Does she wish you didn't tell her? Does she wish she knew sooner?

Your APs never considered the future and made a child keep a huge secret on their behalf for most of his life. This was never going to work. Did they never consider you would hold an interest in meeting your biological parents? Did they really think your sister would never ever find out?", "I think you're NTA because you didn't tell her out of malice, you told her cause you thought she should know and I think that's super reasonable and your parents are a little screwed up thinking it would be okay to NEVER tell her...like wtf that's crazy and putting that pressure on you at 7, Jesus.  You gave them an out to do it themselves and they chose not too and hopefully they'll get over it sooner rather than later.  Good luck dearie.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been a foster parent and it is ALWAYS recommended that you let children know they are adopted, so you can raise them with an understanding of what that means. It was really messed up of your parents to do that to Elizabeth, but even my the messed up of them to force you to lie to her for so long.", "NTA. Your adoptive parents made really selfish, damaging choices for all three of you. Asking you to keep this kind of secret, making it clear that you were not really wanted, playing favorites. \n\nNo one in the adoption field would approve of hiding your and your sister's story from her. And that they planned to keep playing pretend about her birth origin is unconscionable.", "Not OP but an adoptee. Why now because sooner is always better than later to find this out. Why not earlier, because OPs adoptive parents made it known to her they really only wanted her sister, yes they cared and provided for her, but the fact they asked a child to keep it secret and then cut her off when she did tell shows that no matter when OP told she was going to get grief from the only parents she had. Now she has started forming a relationship with her bio mother and has some form of parental support (though admittedly not the same but some form) to help her through now losing her adoptive parents. \n\nIt should never have been kept a secret. And punishing OP for doing what is right by Elizabeth is wrong. I applaud OP for taking this step. \n\nAlso doing it before Elizabeth is 16 gives her time to process her feelings before being able to reach out. A lot of adoptees that find out later in life run straight to their bio parents and things don\u2019t always work out how they want, heck they don\u2019t even know what they want as they are still processing finding out their entire life was a lie and processing the loss and grieving. It is definitely better she has time to process this and get therapy before she is able to make contact.", "This is what gets me to lean toward YTA. I totally agree with OP's sentiment, but the timeline feels arbitrary. 16 is a hard enough age without this kind of truth bomb being dropped on you, and if she was planning to stay in contact with biomom, there was no reason why it couldn't have been done when sister was more mature and secure.", "Their her parents, but they don't own her.", "The emotional damage would only be even bigger when she found out later. Except in that case, she could rightly ask OP\n\n\"Why did you never tell me?\"\n\nI could never lie to my sibling like that. If the truth hurts, then it hurts. But everyone deserves the truth.", "This comment speaks volumes. NTA. The adoptive parents are clearly the AHs for making the whole issue about themselves and not about the feelings of the youngest.", "Well sherlock, was it all you hoped for? Was it the right thing to do? I'm guessing you don't think so now.", "That actually does make a difference.", "So anyone that's had addiction issues is not a good person worth knowing? or are you saying she abandoned the children? because she most likely got the children taken away from her.", "She needs to know for medical reasons for one thing.

Now that you are 18 and can make your own choices I can answer any and all questions you have.", "I agree that you're NTA. Since you're developing a relationship with your bio mom, it's only a matter of time until your sister gets suspicious of something. Your sister has been lied to by every person who claims to love her for her entire life. Expecting you to keep even more things from her would create even more resentment in the future. She's 16, not 6. There is no reason to put that kind of weight on your shoulders. \n\nI'm glad your bio mom has been sober for 8 years. I hope you can have whatever relationship with her that you want without being let down. I had a friend who developed a wonderful friendship with his bio mom. I hope you can too!", "This!!!

More than frustrating.  Demeaning?  Belittling?  To have people decide they know best for you, to \u201cprotect\u201d you from information.  I understand where it is something that doesn\u2019t really involve you and they will never tell you (as in my sister\u2019s personal life isn\u2019t my business or right to know if she chooses not to share), but when it does involve you and someone has just unilaterally decided to control the timing?  Or that you don\u2019t need to know something that directly impacts your life?

We can't have that! My continued suffering is much more important than doing right by my sister!\"\n\nOP is a victim in this, too, and also deserves relief and a chance to heal. Forcing a child to keep such a big a secret for adults is, in my opinion, a form of mild child abuse in most cases. Waiting for two years isn't going to change the processing that the sister will have to do. It's only going to reduce the amount of time she'll have to come to terms with the knowledge before she is being expected to make a decision about meeting her mother. There is no benefit to the sister for waiting another two years so why does it matter if OP's motivations are multi-faceted? He made a decision that's best for both him AND his sister instead of one that would be damaging to both of them.\n\nAnd it's not like he didn't think about it and blurted it out first chance he got after making the decision to tell her. He warned his parents and gave them a chance to tell the truth in their own way and on their own terms and waited long enough to give them a chance to do so. They just didn't take him  seriously.", "And you think the sister is gonna take it well when she finds out OP's been in contact with their bio mom for a whole 2 years while still keeping it from her? Are y'all for real? Do you guys even think?", "I want to hug your parents. It's nice to see a story about people doing things the right way.", "It makes perfect sense to me because OP is now in contact with their mother and now forming a relationship. It was a secret before but now OP has an actual connection with their bio mom. Hiding that relationship for 2 years I feel would be an even bigger betrayal than just hiding that they were adopted.", "Thank you!! Getting a bit teary eyed today thinking about my dad who passed away a few years ago from early onset Alzheimer\u2019s. \n\nHim and my mom (who already were both divorced from other marriages previously) were going to just be long term engaged unmarried partners because they were a bit jaded of the idea of marriage.

Let's continue torturing ourselves for another two years by continuing to do what I've now realised isn't right because I personally should have to continue to suffer, even if it means my sibling also continues to be wronged for another two years! My continued suffering is more important than the actual truth!

Yes, they should put themselves in each of your shoes before judging you. \n\nI understand why they wanted it to be secret, but it\u2019s not feasible, it wouldn\u2019t have stayed secret forever, and then  the betrayal would have been worse.", "NTA.

Sure, they most likely will come to feel that their adopted family is their true family, but there is so much more your gambling on by not being truthful.

If it were me, I would have said something even sooner, but obviously no shame in telling her now than earlier or later. Your adoptive parents should have never put the burden of pretending to be biological kids in the first place. It\u2019s an insane breech of trust on their part to your little sister, and Georgia might just be upset because she grew up thinking that this was right when you knew in your heart that it was wrong. Good luck, hopefully they realize how important this was for your sister rather than demonizing you for being truthful.\n\nNTA", "NOT ok for them to ask OP to do this and I\u2019m so sorry you had to be traumatized in this way.

He would get extra presents on his gotcha day, be told special bedtime children\u2019s stories on adoption (like how he was so special and wanted), etc. He\u2019s the happiest, most secure kid I know.

I cannot imagine the pain that lie caused you throughout your childhood, but I can understand not being able to live with the lie any longer.\n\nIn this age of DNA testing and genealogy websites, I don't think there can be \"closed\" adoptions anymore. Two of my co-workers are adopted and their adoptive parents weren't given any information about the birth families. Both these women used genealogy websites to find cousins, half-siblings, etc., and now know their family histories. Both have said this gave them a sense of peace that was missing from their lives, despite having happy childhoods and good adult relationships with their adoptive parents.\n\nI hope your adoptive parents will come around and realize they were in the wrong on this, and that you and your older sister will be able to patch things up, too.

And by 18, I\u2019m assuming she would have formed a semi-complete identity and then to have to completely change that would be harder then incorporating that knowledge before reaching the arbitrary age of adulthood. \n\nSister now has a few years to reconcile her feelings regarding the adoption, the adoptive family\u2019s difficulties lying, and the process of maturing that naturally takes place - before attempting contact with bio mom and hanging all of her hopes and dreams on something that may disappoint.

I have worked with children and adults that were devastated to learn they were adopted and found it difficult to cope. Especially if they found out the reasons why they were put up for adoption in the first place. Not everybody is put up for adoption because the mother is young or the mother just can't keep the child. Many children are put up for adoption because of horrific abusive situations. Not everybody wants to know where they come from.", "It\u2019s devastating to find out the people you love and trust would lie to you like that. I\u2019m sorry your parents decided to do your sister that way. You deserve better as well.

I hope your sister can heal and that you both find some peace. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "thank you for bringing up the trauma, that is so often missed with regards to adoption.", "I worked in child services for years. And there's a reason why some adoptions are closed. Many children are in adoptive situations because their parents were abusive or neglecting. Also if parental rights were involuntarily terminated, you don't want a parent showing up and trying to take the children or harassing the adoptive parents. There is such a thing as an open adoption where biological parents are still involved and get visitation and pictures so many times a year. But the court only does this if it thought to be in the best interest of the child. By the way, I was adopted by my stepfather.", "As someone who works with foster and adopted children, statistically... children do better when they know where they come from. There can be a lot of trauma and resentment when they feel betrayed that they have been lied to. There has been a huge push in recent years to encourage adoptive families to start the conversations young and focus on the idea that family doesn't have to be blood only. OP's adoptive family has created this rift and this trust issue and once trust is broken it is immensely difficult to rebuild. Not only did they lie to Elizabeth and likely cause an identity crisis, they were cruel to OP and openly admitted they were unwanted. Regardless of how they were treated growing up, admitting this fact was cruel and since they so easily tossed their child aside, they are AH. \n\nThere is also a push in recent years for open adoptions, to maintain biological connections, especially with older children as it can help them adjust with less grief over so many losses of connections and their identity. The idea is to have a healthy family environment and safety without losing their identity and connections. So often in this field we worry about physical safety that we forget the emotional damage severing a childs entire identity and connections can have. It doesn't work for everyone and sometimes can be dangerous or have a bad dynamic. There are plenty of legitimate reasons why a child's well-being is better without those connections. The biological family could be dangerous and could threaten the adoptive family, attempt to kidnap the child, could have severely hurt the child, etc. Contact should be considered on a case to case basis and weigh safety versus potential emotional benefits. If there is a 16 year old that couldn't live with grandma and grandpa because they were too sick to provide care... is that really fair to sever that connection? Every situation is unique. Therefore OP's family isn't terrible for wanting to move away for a fresh start. Plenty of adoptive families don't want any ongoing drama by running into biological friends and family... especially with older children who can talk and create an unintentional safety issue. They are AH's for lying about being biological parents though. It is a tough conversation, but can be done really well and there are so many resources to help families with the discussion and how to handle issues that may come up. In fact, it can be a bonding experience to do genealogy projects and make two trees that are connected by the child (adoptive and biological connected). There is a ton of research and most workers in this field are required to take trainings now to understand the impact of adoptions and what we have learned so we can do better. \n\nUltimately, the point is lying is never a good idea. OP is absolutely NTA. This was a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation. Elizabeth would have been more devastated to feel OP also lied and then went behind her back to have a relationship with bio mom. OP didn't provide any private identifying or contact information, just shattered the illusion of their perfect little family. \n\nAlso, there is a push for counseling now for adoptive parents for reasons just like this. Adoptive children are NOT your backup plan and are not a consolation prize because you have fertility issues. Adopting a child should be because you want a child, no matter how or from where, that you will love unconditionally.", "Agree.\n\nMassive NTA. There are lots of AHs in this situation, mainly the awful parents for asking you to lie for all these years.\n\nBut you and your little sis are not AHs, you were right to tell her as soon as you felt like you were ready, and if it were me, I'd offer Elizabeth the chance to come with you to meet the birth mother. You never know how things will change in 2 yrs.", "Now I feel I missed out on the extra cake, although my adoption was finalized at Christmas - my parents always called me their Christmas Pressie.", "I think the word you might be reaching for is \"Infantilizing\" - you're not treating them as an adult with full agency, but as a child who needs to be cared for and protected, regardless of their ability to cope with complex information.", "No you\u2019re so right.

And being on the side of the knowing and not saying cuz people are telling you you can\u2019t tell them \u201cfor their own good\u201d it\u2019s so frustrating. Cuz my sister was mad at me for lying and I was sorry for lying to her too. \n\nIt\u2019s demeaning to the other party. Like you\u2019re saying I know more than you about things that pertain to you.
