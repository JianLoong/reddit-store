They put their selfish desire to live a fantasy over your sisters wellbeing.\n\nSorry for the rant but adoptive parents who do this make me furious, and so does anyone who thinks YTA because adopted children owe their parents for raising them and so you or your sister going against them is \"disloyal\" or \"ungrateful\". You weren't wrong for telling your sister, and she wouldn't be in the wrong for never trusting them again.\n\nIf anything I'd question if its the right choice to gatekeep your mother's info from her. \n\nI'd say you should have told her sooner but that's not really fair when you were under their care etc.", "I know someone who found out she was adopted as an adult.

Maybe you should have talked with the older sister first, to try to preserve that relationship, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep this from E. Besides not wanting to lie to her, there are so many ways for her to find out. Her birth certificate might have the info on it or indicate that it\u2019s amended. She could find the court documents.

That does *not* sit right with me. EDIT: I see your adoptive mom choose not to tell your sister due to the pain of not being her biologically daughter, even though i understand, its a very selfish reason to make such a choice.  \nYou are quite lucky your sister is on your side, if she weren't, your adoptive stepmom would have kept you away from your sister.  \nI think you did well by choosing to tell your sister, also well done on protecting her and keeping her private information private.   \nAlso for not breaking the bond and trust of your little sister.

This is unfortunately quite common and there isn\u2019t much you can do to prevent it from happening, but the fact that they TOLD YOU THIS is infuriating. I am so sorry that you and your sisters had to deal with this. I am sure they provided you all with a loving and stable home, but that does not excuse how they approached adoption and parenting.

People's obsessions with biological children never made sense to me and the way you foster a good relationship with anyone is one rooted in honesty and mutual trust. \n\nBut Elizabeth is still a minor.

I think the parents are evil for how they treated the OP. I think that him being honest with her, IF THE INTENTIONS WERE HONORABLE, is genuinely good. But I don't think the intentions were honorable.

OP is an adult. As an adult, he is responsible for his own actions. He \\_DIDN'T\\_ tell his sister when he was a kid. If he wasn't able to keep this big, important secret as a child, that would've been totally understandable. If he was 16, and his sister was 9, and he was posting this, I'd be 100% N/T/A on this, because he'd have done it as a kid. But he didn't. He kept the secret his whole childhood, and then 5 years into his independent, adult life. Only now, when he's tracked down his bio mom, his sister is at a really vulnerable age, NOW he tosses this hand grenade into her life when he can be held completely responsible for his own actions and be expected to understand the consequences. There's a gulf of difference here.\n\nI am very explicitly not justifying the adoptive parents, because what they did was VILE. To expect a child to keep a lie that big from their own bio sister, the one person they could have shared feelings with and had understand them, was horrible. It ensured that OP was isolated. The fact that they then told him outright that they only adopted him because it was a package deal? Holy shit, fuck those people. That's outright evil. So do not conflate my judgement with any sort of justification of their actions. That's why I edited the judgement.\n\nThat does not, however, justify him blowing up his sisters whole world, out of the blue, for no real reason, when she can't even get anything out of it. He's shattered her fragile little world, at basically the most fragile time in development where a person is rebelling and trying to establish a firm sense of self. He undermined her whole foundation, and he did it because he has a (WHOLLY justified) chip on his shoulder about the adoptive parents. She is basically collateral damage in this, and the worst part is she isn't even allowed to know her bio mom and learn anything of value out of this. He just grenaded her world, to feel better himself, and his sister only gets hurt by everything. THAT is why I have a problem with the OP. Not because I think the adoptive parents are anything other than the cruel, and inhuman trash they are.", "\"no real reason\" the reason is that he was in contact with their bio mom which adds another layer of lying. If I found out my sibling had been keeping that from me for two years it would take me much longer to forgive them. \n\nEdited for clarity", "Right? It's one thing to blow up this kid's life with this information, but now you're going to not tell her about her bio mom for another 2 years? How do you think this is going to play out, when she finds out that you've had a relationship with your bio mom this entire time and not let her know about or even be a part of it?!? What do you think your relationship with her is going to be like then?\n\nYTA, there are no altruistic reasons here for giving her this information, you did it simply out of spite because you weren't the favorite child. Which, by the way, wasn't her fault yet you're now making her pay the price for it.", "Um, okay, that was... Badly worded. Maybe \"no justifiable reason\" is a better way to state it. The issue is he legally cannot give her the biomom's info and get them in contact, so she's now stuck living in limbo for the next two years, or the OP is risking the parents pressing charges against him (and it sounds like those vile piles of human waste would do it in a heartbeat).\n\nSo even if he genuinely had the best of intentions, and I still think this smacks of being a bit too self serving for that, he's now punishing and hurting his sister for the next two years before he can legally repair any of it... Or having to rely on the original liars to decide to fix it for him, which seems unlikely.\n\nI am dubious of his intentions, but I am rock solid in my feelings that he has unnecessarily hurt his sister, with no real remediation available, and that's just cruel to her. Hence me saying ESH. The adoptive parents are human trash for how they treated the OP, but he hurt someone who is totally innocent in this for reasons that really feel to me like they are selfish, and that's also asshole behavior.", "The very justifiable reason is that he is currently in contact with their mother. I don't understand why you don't see that it would be a huge betrayal to be in full contact with his biological mother and not even tell his sister that she was adopted. \n\nI was adopted in a closed adoption so legally I wasn't allowed to contact my birth mother until I was 18, but my parents still told me I was adopted and if I'd had any older siblings, them lying to me about being in contact with that birth mother would have been an extra violation on top of the previous lies. At least this way she has time to process the information that she was adopted before she even has to confront the idea of whether or not she wants a relationship with her bio mother.", "I see it as now the sister has two years to come to terms with it and figure out what she wants to do when she turns 18.", "Lies hurt more than the truth, they just take longer to get there. Yeah, he's been lying to his sister for 16 years now, he could've come clean at any moment, but when you've been going that long it's hard to break the cycle. There's always a reason to just continue as you had before. He broke the cycle, and he should be applauded not berated. She deserves to know the truth, she deserves to decide who she wants to continue to trust. Her adoptive parents are responsible for the damage this causes at 16 years old, not her brother. This doesn't get better or easier in 2 years, it gets harder and more painful. While you could be right regarding his intentions, and yes, his intentions could still be assholish; but I think you're only seeing the pain she's in right now, and not realizing that it would've been just as bad (or worse) if he continued kicking that can down the road.
