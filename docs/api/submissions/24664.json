{"id": 24664, "submission_id": "15ravfa", "title": "AITA for sleeping in instead of driving my \u201cfamily\u201d to the airport?", "selftext": "So my mom\u2019s cousins have been staying with us for a week and a half, visiting from out of the country during their summer break. Yesterday was their last night, and they needed a ride to the airport since my parents had work. My sister, who also drives, had work later at 11 am. Context: I had been working exhausting 10-hour shifts outdoors all week and today was finally my day off \u2013 the first in nearly a week and my only break until Sunday.\n\nAt the dinner table last night, my mom unexpectedly volunteered me to drive them to the airport early in the morning. I immediately rebutted, saying, \"I can\u2019t, tomorrow is my only day off, and I want to sleep in.\u201d My response might have been a bit direct, but I wanted to be honest upfront, avoiding false commitments and giving my moms cousins enough time to plan ahead. My mom got frustrated, claiming I was too blunt. While I could have been more diplomatic, and granted I may have been too blunt, I\u2019d rather be blunt than go back on my word.\n\nMy mom's cousins seemed to understand; they mentioned they were planning to use an Uber anyway before this conversation was even brought up. Nonetheless, my mom kept insisting that I would drive them. They said that it was fine that Uber would be the easiest thing for everyone. In private, she pressed me again, and I apologized for my bluntness but stood by what I said. I wouldn't give up my day off to chauffeur distant relatives I'd just met a week and a half ago.\n\nI thought the matter was settled after that. However, this morning at 9 am, my phone rang, and my mom demanded I wake up and drive them. While 9 am isn't dawn, considering I wake up at 6:30 for my shifts, it felt early. I was frustrated because I thought I'd made myself clear the previous night. I stood my ground, telling her that I couldn't do it and they should find another solution.\n\nI hung up the phone, and she called back immediately, upset that I'd hung up, and called me a bad host, emphasizing the importance of family helping each other. I understand the importance of family, but these cousins were practically strangers. They were my second cousins once removed, and my relationship with them was barely existent. It seemed unfair to give up my only day off, especially when they were comfortable using Uber.\n\nMy mom could have asked my sister to drive them, as her work started later. However, she insisted on me, which only added to my frustration. I don\u2019t think that standing up for my much-needed rest was unreasonable.

You were upfront and honest about your boundaries and she just ran rough-shod over them as though they didn't exist.  Not cool. \n\nYou are NTA. Your mother though...you need a solid chat with her about your boundaries.", "NTA. This seems to be more about her controlling you than there being an actual need. If she really needed someone to take them, she could have asked your sister, arranged to go in to work late, or paid for an Uber. But her insisting on specifically you taking them is suspicious.", "NTA. If your mother thinks it is polite to insist that your family drive them to the airport rather than let them take an Uber as they plan, she can be the one to drive them (or someone could volunteer).

At that point it\u2019s done but your mother pressed the issue for no real reason.", "This sounds like a mom problem as neither the cousins or you wanted you to drive them. Mom probably wanted to project a certain image that perhaps you were blowing for her. You did the right thing though. Your free time is not hers to spend .", "NTA.  Your mother had no right to volunteer you.  Understand you were caught off guard and perhaps were too blunt but still blame your mother.", "NTA time to mute the phone for the rest of the day", "NTA your mom tried to voluntell you to do something literally nobody else thought you should have to do.  That's not the way adults interact with each other.", "NTA. But why can't your mom drive them?", "You were NTA. Your mom was the host, not you. You were having a well deserved break.", "NTA, your mom volunteered you in front of them to force you to do it and you're allowed to say no. If it meant so much, she could use a vacay day and take them. SHE is the host, not you!!!

Doesn't make her right, though.)", "INFO\n\nProbably NTA, but what time did they need to be at the airport and how far is the drive?", "Info: How old are you?\n\nIf you are a minor, NTA all day. If you are not a minor, and you live in your parents house, sometimes you get voluntold to do things by your parents, and that's just the way it goes sometimes (at least I sure did after high school when I was living with my parents)", "YTA - Unsure how old you are, but I am assuming you are living with your parents rent free? And they probably do things for you all the time that inconvenience them? Well, here was your turn to do something selfless to pay it back.\n\nPeople have confused - and normalized - being selfish and inconsiderate as self care. Do something for someone else graciously and make the world a kinder place. I promise you that international travel is a whole lot shittier than waking up at 9 a.m. And even shittier, feeling like an inconvenience when you are staying in someone else's home.", "ESH\n\nThe mom is way too pushy and definitely needs to respect your decisions and time, but you also really should have been more diplomatic. You put her in an uncomfortable spot and made it seem like you didn\u2019t care for the cousin at all and don\u2019t want to waste time chauffeuring someone you don\u2019t care about.\n\nSo yeah, bit more tact should\u2019ve been employed here but the mother definitely was a bit too hard leaning", "YTA. Oh, no! You only got to sleep in an extra 2.5 hours! \n\nAnyways, just remember next time no one in your family will do something for you that you are OK with them not giving up something they prefer to help you out.", "ESH. Mom pressuring you that way after forcefully volunteering you earns her an AH. \n\nYour lack of tact earns you one. \n\nNot sure how late \u201csleeping in\u201d is to you but if you weren\u2019t needed until after 9am (which most people consider sleeping in), it just sounds like you didn\u2019t want to do it so be honest about that. Your over-rationalization for why not comes across disingenuous, especially when you take the time to emphasize twice that you didn\u2019t know them well. They didn\u2019t know you well, but made the trip anyway to get to know you better. \nAdditionally, if the airport is close by then not offering the kindness for dropping them off should not be hinged on that fact that you just met these relatives. Kindness is kindness without petty conditions. It\u2019s your prerogative to offer the kindness or not offer the kindness. Like they said, they were fine with the the Uber so you don\u2019t have to take them to the airport if you don\u2019t want, but don\u2019t be disingenuous about the reasons why to make yourself feel better about it.", "YTA  You could just do one thing for someone.
