Me, DH & our 3 young kids flew overseas for his funeral for 5 days. While away, house was meant to be empty. We paid our friend to clean for us while gone & check on the place. My husband offered for BIL to use his car if he wanted (BIL doesn't have his own). BIL offered to do our bins for us, DH accepted & said if he did *need* to stay over for that he could.\n\nSaturday it was clear from our security cameras, BIL had invited himself to stay for the whole time. I was a bit pissed but waved it off, as long as he put the bins out and the house was safe, *secure* and tidy, it's okay. Saturday night all our security cameras go dark. DH messaged BIL to ask if everything was okay cos our cameras had gone off. BIL said yes everything was fine. \n\nSunday got a message from our friend (cleaning) saying \"Oops! Just scared the shit out of [BIL] and the girl he had round!\" I asked her to clarify. Said she walked in on BIL & a woman on our couch. Our friend then asked them to leave and they got their stuff from the master & ensuite before leaving. \n\nSunday night cameras all come back on. I go back to the timestamp where they went off, & see BIL covering our security cameras. (Note: these ALL are external ONLY). He knew we had recently had our car stolen & it cost over $1000 to sort. But here he is, covering our security cameras, to bring a random person into our house, & our bedroom, while we are gone. \n\nDH messaged BIL: \"Who's the girl you had round?\" BIL: \"I don't know what you mean.\" DH says \"Boyfriend then?\" BIL responds \"\ud83d\ude09\" and hubby sends footage of him covering cameras and the message from our friend. BIL admits to having a woman around.\n\nFriend goes back Tuesday to check on things. She'd changed our sheets on Sunday, bed clearly slept in by Tuesday; and shit in our ensuite. She recleaned the general messes he'd made.\n\nTuesday night in a phonecall between DH and BIL, hubby tried to explain why we are upset and feel disrespected; and told him to leave immediately\n\nRe cameras - he \"doesn't like being filmed\" - they're not his security cameras to mess with. I don't think what he did to the cameras is okay.\nDH had to send the video of BIL covering the camera and the message from our friend to him for him to come clean. He then lied to DH saying he didn't take the girl into our room (which he was seen doing). Using our bed is a whole other thing.. There is a big spare bed.\nOur friend had to reclean so hubby asked for a $50 cleaning fee from BIL too. \n\nBIL ended the conversation by directing at me: \"Okay [name], I know you're going through some stuff right now so I'll tidy up and leave.\" But it had nothing to do with my feelings, and everything to do with how he behaved. \n\nWe are married with 3 young children; this is our private family home.

Oh yeah, this is the asshole forum.  Sorry, what an ASSHOLE bil is.  Then he lied to both of you, and THEN blamed you for being upset at his overstepping?  I bet he never has another instance of entering into your home.", "NTA\n\nHe knew he shouldn't be doing any of that, otherwise he'd 1) tell you beforehand and 2) not cover the cameras so you wouldn't see what he was doing.

Why would you even let him in your house ever again?  Change all your locks and passwords immediately, and add some extra, hidden security cameras around the house and the exterior of your property.  \n\nThis man is a thief and a liar.

I can't get past the security cameras honestly.", "I was surprised DH stood his ground honestly - but when we got home he discovered BIL scratched the frypan and *that* was the final straw for him \ud83d\ude02", "Someone else has also mentioned billing him more and here I was fretting that I was TA for billing him for the extra cleaning and kicking him out to start with \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude02", "I wanted to tell him this is why he's still single, but I was genuinely trying *not* to be an asshole \ud83d\ude02", "No!! Sorry! Our car was stolen shortly before Easter and BIL is aware of this and this was a major reason we spent a bomb on tightening our security and changing our locks. He's aware what we spent to do that and knows insurance wouldn't cover it without us claiming under and paying excess on multiple policies so it was an OoP expense. We added a security camera covering our front porch and yard due to the incident and this was one of the 3 outdoor security cameras that he covered up, and then proceeded to bring a stranger into the house (our door is now code locked rather than a key so we have to change the code in case BIL gave it to this girl). God if he'd stolen our car he wouldn't be anywhere near our house, don't worry!!", "Not at all, it's not normal for him to leave prepped food in a house that isn't his and didn't have permission to stay in. And the security camera thing was so inconsiderate of him. What if there had been a robbery? He sacrificed your valuables to have a girl over in a house that is, again, not his.
