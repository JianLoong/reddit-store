There is a big spare bed.\nOur friend had to reclean so hubby asked for a $50 cleaning fee from BIL too. \n\nBIL ended the conversation by directing at me: \"Okay [name], I know you're going through some stuff right now so I'll tidy up and leave.\" But it had nothing to do with my feelings, and everything to do with how he behaved. \n\nWe are married with 3 young children; this is our private family home.

Sorry! Our car was stolen shortly before Easter and BIL is aware of this and this was a major reason we spent a bomb on tightening our security and changing our locks. He's aware what we spent to do that and knows insurance wouldn't cover it without us claiming under and paying excess on multiple policies so it was an OoP expense. We added a security camera covering our front porch and yard due to the incident and this was one of the 3 outdoor security cameras that he covered up, and then proceeded to bring a stranger into the house (our door is now code locked rather than a key so we have to change the code in case BIL gave it to this girl).

When my friend went in to clean the next morning and messaged to say someone else was there, I rechecked the cameras at the timestamp when they went offline and found footage of him covering them. BIL had unplugged the eternally wired one so it flagged as offline and we couldn't see the footage until it was plugged back in, and the other cameras were just dark and then the WiFi wouldn't connect to review the footage (suspect he switched off the WiFi for a while or its a very happy coincidence for him). So it wasn't until the following morning that we could access the footage of before they went down and see that he did it.", "The BIL is good with entertaining the kids, and the kids are good at wearing me thin.

Because you think having sex in your brother's bed in is fun? What possible reason do you have for treating our home like this?
