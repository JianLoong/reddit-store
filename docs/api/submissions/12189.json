My 16 yo niece is invited, but the 9 yo and 7 yo aren't.\n\nTammy didn't take this well and pretty much went off at me. We do have one exception to this, my FBIL's son who's 11 (12 at the wedding). Tammy tried using that as an \"example\" and also said her 16 yo is invited, but I told her that's because she's over 13 and my niece too.\n\nShe did seem to understand and calmed down, but recently told me she won't be coming because of this. On top of that, my niece is also saying she won't come because it's \"unfair\".\n\nMe and Tammy had a huge argument over this and I told her to stop being selfish, my guest list is my guest list and she's acting like she's doing the world a huge favor.\n\nShe got really upset with me and we haven't talked since then.

Seems fair.", "YTA - why does FBIL get the kid exception and your sister doesn't? \n\nTBH, I don't know how you can expect your sister to only bring one of her kids.

You're having a \"not related by blood\"-free wedding. So I bet she's only pushing for exceptions and for dragging the argument out because she knows about the other kid. If you were genuinely having a childfree wedding, and your sister was acting like an entitle mombie, then you'd be justified in your argument.

Yeah it\u2019s your guest list but she has every right not to go to YOUR wedding and accusing her of being selfish is hypocritical.

Why not just make the cutoff 12?", "YTA\n\nThe thing about childfree weddings is that you can restrict who is allowed to come, but then you have to be prepared for hurt feelings on the part of the parents and the kids, and you have to be prepared for families to say no.

If the wedding is 13+up, then your FBIL's daughter ought to not be exempt from that rule. If you really want her to be there, why wouldn't you have made the invite 12+up to include her by rule?
