My 16 yo niece is invited, but the 9 yo and 7 yo aren't.\n\nTammy didn't take this well and pretty much went off at me. We do have one exception to this, my FBIL's son who's 11 (12 at the wedding). Tammy tried using that as an \"example\" and also said her 16 yo is invited, but I told her that's because she's over 13 and my niece too.\n\nShe did seem to understand and calmed down, but recently told me she won't be coming because of this. On top of that, my niece is also saying she won't come because it's \"unfair\".\n\nMe and Tammy had a huge argument over this and I told her to stop being selfish, my guest list is my guest list and she's acting like she's doing the world a huge favor.\n\nShe got really upset with me and we haven't talked since then.
