You say he's wonderful but honestly he sounds awful.  If I were you I wouldn't just be avoiding him in public.", "NTA\n\nWhy us your husband maintaining friendships with people who belittle and criticize his wife? Why did he go with them when it was so clear that you were uncomfortable enough to go home alone rather than subject yourself to more of their awful behaviour, which he is not only enabling but apparently  encouraging?\n\nThis is deeply not okay and he is STILL making it all about him. If you guys care about your marriage then you need marriage counselling - yesterday.", "NTA but your husband is kind of. He doesn\u2019t care that his friends are rude to you as long as you reassure him that he\u2019s the pretty one. He doesn\u2019t care how you feel, at least about this.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve told him that his friends\u2019 behavior towards you hurts you, and he\u2019s done nothing about it and laughed off your pain.  That\u2019s bad partner behavior.  If one of my friends or relatives says something that hurts my husband, I listen to him, comfort him, and have a word with the person who hurt him.  If it happens again, I make it clear that I consider someone hurting my husband deeply infuriating, and it will not be tolerated a third time.  It has never happened a third time; even second times are rare.\n\nSince he won\u2019t address the way his friends hurt you, you very reasonably want nothing to do with them.  Him throwing a pity party tantrum because you aren\u2019t willing to keep being a punching bag and the butt of nasty \u201cjokes\u201d/\u201cteasing\u201d.  Yuck.  This is all very inconsiderate towards you, and very selfish.", "NTA\n\nIf I may ask, are you the bread winner of the family? As I feel that this might be some reasoning behind his constant need for validation. \n\nYou are trying to keep him happy by allowing the friendships that are essentially causing you pain. I also think that you really need to clear the air between you both and find out the real cause of why he constantly needs to be in the spotlight. Its unfair for you to be consistently put down by \"his\" friends.  \n\nPlease don't allow this to continue, you are obviously lovely and a great person for him to be with you. Don't sell yourself short.", "**NTA** \\- There is no reason to subject yourself to abuse.  Your husband should be more proactive and reign his friends in.", "NTA - \nYour husband shouldn\u2019t be making friends with people that treat you as lesser and make you feel as such.

Bulling is when everyone ELSE laughs.\n\nThey're essentially bullying you. Sure, they're praising Derek, but they're doing so at your expense. Explain to him that whether or not they think it's a joke, it's not being taken that way by you. He needs to understand that no matter how much he wants you around them, you will not willingly subject yourself to insults like they've been using.\n\nOn a separate note, be careful here. I've seen far too many posts on relationship subs where \"friends\" like this lead to relationship doubts by the better looking partner. It's insidious how it can creep up, especially if the \"friends\" don't let up and, at least in the posts, have led to some rather serious relationship complications. Derek may feel like he needs reassuring, but he also needs to understand that he's married and needs to support his partner just as much as he wants his partner to support him. That includes defending his partner from insults.", "NTA. You've explained that you're uncomfortable with these friends and you explained why. He should be more receptive and understanding. \n\nOnce this cools off, I'd sit down with him and have a good discussion surrounding his friends and how they make you feel.

It sounds like something else may be brewing under all this.", "NTA \n\nIf you are comfortable, show husband this post. He needs to see the comments and understand how he is hurting you. \n\nHe needs to grow a spine.

And I can honestly not deny that. \n\nHowever, the one and only person's opinion that I give a rat's hell about is my wife, and last time I checked she's pretty happy. He actually sounds like a decent guy with a bit of an ego issue (read self esteem). He seems to really love you, so maybe give him the benefit of the doubt and accept that he may be honest when he says that.", " NTA Your husband cares more about his friends than you.

It doesn\u2019t matter that Derek hasn\u2019t had close friends before. If his friends are saying nasty stuff about you it\u2019s on him to shut that down. Right now he either:\n\n1) doesn\u2019t care that these friends are rude to you, or 2) he\u2019s scared that standing up for you will make them not want to be his friend\n\nBoth of those are massive issues. If it\u2019s #1, it means he clearly doesn\u2019t care about your feelings. If it\u2019s #2, what else will he do to fit in with this group at your expense?\n\nAlso, I see you\u2019ve commented \u201coh he\u2019s great in every other way\u201d but tbh that\u2019s always what someone says about a partner that ends up being a jerk", "Ask him why he's ok with his friends criticizing you.\n\n>Except several people in the group are very critical of me especially my looks compared to my husband. \n\nPraising him for being attractive is one thing, criticizing you because you're not as attractive is another.

He said it felt like I didn\u2019t love him anymore and wanted to leave. \n\nAnd here he has the consequences of his behaviour. By allowing his friends to put you down, **he's** created a scenario where you don't want to be around his friends. He could have (should have) stopped this when they started doing it. He definately should have stopped this once you talked to him about it, but he dismissed you. Now here we are, and its on him, not you.", "NTA. Your husband should shut down his friends when they say these remarks. He doesn\u2019t because he is prioritizing his ego and validation over your feelings.", "NTA.

Do you have a support network of your own in your new area?", "NTA. Your husband really needs to take a hard look at what (and who) he values more. Sounds like he lets his friends put you down because they build him up at your expense. This situation is unsustainable for you, especially if he's going to start insisting you see them. It is entirely unfair to you to let these people (I hesitate to say friends because real friends don't do that sort of nonsense) keep trashing you and your marriage this way. Eventually he's going to have to make a choice, and if you have any doubt about who he will choose, you need to sit down and have a few long hard talks about everything.", "Um excuse me, but your husband must not be all that good.
