She has two german sheperds that her and her roommate looks after, both of them I've only seen a handful of times and unfortunately both dogs act aggressive (growling and snapping) towards my chihuahua Johnny. \n\nI've told her that this was a concern, I've had him for over 8 years so if anything happened to Johnny I wouldn't know what to do but she brushes it off as her dogs \"being puppies\" and that they were actually sweethearts who are just curious about him. She has had those \"puppies\" for almost two years now. Her dogs are problematic. The few times I saw her roommate walking the dogs they were getting up close and sniffing every person walking past and barking loudly at other dogs. They are clearly untrained, it's a miracle that no one complains about it. I brought up the issue and she said she was working on it but the last time I saw her dogs around in public, their behaviour haven't improved which makes me think she doesn't care and that they will continue to act the same way towards my boy Johnny.\n\nI've suggested that she leave the dogs with her roommate who seems to be the caretaker of the dogs the few times I've been over, or with the shelter because I don't think our dogs can live together safely. She won't accept it, telling me that they are hers and that they are friendly and won't ever harm my dog. I've even said that she didn't have to part with her dogs, if we lived together she could just travel to see them but she complained about the distance and how she doesn't have time to travel that far.\n\nIt was either her dogs or mine but I can't part with Johnny, so after giving her a condition that if she can't leave hers then she shouldn't live with me, she started crying. She broke down saying things like how are we going to be together in the future if I wouldn't even let her live with me. I told her over and over that she could but she just couldn't bring her dogs, and if we couldn't live together then we wouldn't be able to see each other often anymore. After an hour of her trying to convince me I lost my cool a bit and said that she should just get rid of her dogs. She got up and left and wouldn't even answer any of my calls, it's been a few days now and I'm nervous to even visit her to make up for it. She doesn't seem to care about Johnny and I think that she overreacted.

Basically, they have to live completely separated 24/7 within the same house. It\u2019s very problematic as you have to divide your time and has caused a rift in the relationship.  This has been going on for years now. I am extremely sympathetic to people\u2019s love of their pets, but having to live like that is difficult on the people and the dogs as, no matter where you are in the house, you are ignoring a pet or not able to truly relax in your home.

A hyper large dog will easily kick or trip a tiny dog which can seriously injure it.\n\nOne aggressive snap will break your chihuahuas skull.\n\nPlease keep your pup safe and do not let it live with her dogs.", "NTA because it sounds like her dogs may be a true liability. I don\u2019t just fear for your little dog, but also *you*. What is your renters insurance policy? Does it include dog bites? Many don\u2019t \u2014 even if they do, they may exclude certain breeds of dogs. Guess a common breed that isn\u2019t covered by liability insurance (and may not even be permitted in many apartments): German Shepherds. This is not random. I know the focus here is on your dog, but I\u2019m not convinced these dogs are trustworthy around people (I could be wrong). You can sometimes find additional policies to cover you, but you need to do your research. Keep in mind that if they were to bite someone in your home, you could be on the hook for that person\u2019s medical bills.\n\nOf course, there are good German Shepherds out there, but I don\u2019t trust at least 90% I\u2019ve seen (veterinarian here). They are intelligent dogs who need proper training and daily activity. When they are trained and socialized, they are *incredible* dogs. Unfortunately, many people get dogs who do not fit their lifestyle. Behavior issues are far too common, and the pandemic has not helped the situation.\n\nInjuries between dogs of different sizes are so common we actually have an acronym for it: \u201cBDLD,\u201d meaning \u201cbig dog, little dog.\u201d The injuries can be horrifying and fatal, and it only takes a few seconds. It\u2019s why I\u2019m not a fan of public dog parks. I\u2019ve seen too much of what can happen there, and I\u2019m not willing to risk it myself.\n\nI do find it odd that it sounds like you\u2019ve only spent a minimal amount of time with these dogs but are about to move in together. Why is that? Moving in together is a very big step, and as described I don\u2019t think the necessary conversations and compromises have been adequately discussed. I understand she may be upset and find the conversation difficult, and it\u2019s obviously likely that it won\u2019t go as she plans. I think a reasonable compromise is to *postpone* moving together (and definitely let her know that it\u2019s temporary until her dogs are safe), and for her to start working with a dog trainer, obedience classes, whatever is necessary. I\u2019m not talking about one or two classes, but a weekly routine for a minimum of a few months. There\u2019s no guarantee it will be enough at this point, but it\u2019s the only way to try. If she\u2019s not willing to train the dogs (and/or the dogs don\u2019t respond positively to training), then don\u2019t move in together. Simple as that. The ball is in her court.\n\nEdit to add: I don\u2019t think I said this explicitly enough, but many dogs like German Shepherds need daily exercise. Even if their training is perfect, if they don\u2019t get their energy out, they can be a nightmare. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case here. If it becomes apparent that these dogs need multiple daily walks to stay behaved, she will need to stick with that routine. You may even want to get a commitment from her in writing (a sort of \u201croommate agreement\u201d where you both commit to whatever routine seems reasonable). Too many people move in together assuming you\u2019ll just \u201cfigure it out\u201d but then are disappointed they aren\u2019t doing their fair share of the household chores.", "I have to question the intelligence and judgement of anyone who owns two German Shepherds and lives in an apartment.

Whoever gives up their dog(s) will resent the other.", "ESH\n\nYour concerns are valid but I feel like your delivery/problem solving is what pushed you into asshole territory.\n\nGoing only off of what you have provided here, yes, it does sound like her dogs are not trained and cannot be trusted.\n\nEspecially with your comment about her brushing off their behavior because they're \"puppies\", it seems clear she is not realistic and/or serious about her dog's behavior.\n\nHowever, your pushing for her to give up her dogs, leave her dogs behind, and/or take her dogs to a shelter seems pushy bordering on controlling and entirely too soon.\n\nI feel like there could be a more in depth solving process before jumping to those conclusions.\n\nFor example, you say you see the roommate doing all the care for the dogs. Instead of accusing your gf of not caring for the dogs, say that you notice the roommate doing a lot of the care and communicate, calmly, that seeing this makes you concerned about how involved she is with her own pet's care.\n\nIf she is serious about pet ownership and you two both want to work this out, maybe she can communicate with the roommate and your gf can spend a week where the roommate does not do any work for the dogs and your gf does all the work. If it goes well, you have the peace of mind knowing that she can put in the work and if it doesn't maybe she will see how much work her pets need and she can make appropriate decisions about their care.\n\nIf you are honestly concerned how they react to your dog, why not do more doggy playdates? Meet in neutral locations like dog parks and watch their behavior closely. Go slow, with dogs on leashes (maybe have friends present so each dog can have a separate handler). Watch how all dogs respond. Are her dogs aggressive or just playful? Do they get into play stance? Do they growl at your dog? Try to be open minded. Make sure to watch your dog's behavior too. Are her dogs responding to your dog's behavior? Is your dog growling or showing teeth? Is your dog cowering behind your legs or seeking their attention.\n\nAlso please keep in mind, dogs can be protective of their owners. Their behavior may change if they don't feel like they need to \"protect\" you. It may be worth trying to have you hold the lead for her dog(s) while she holds the lead for  yours during a puppy playdate and see how that goes.\n\nIf her dogs are indeed continuing to show concerning signs, would she be open to taking them to a trainer? Sit down and have a calm conversation with her about how much time and/or money she is willing to dedicate to fix her dog's behavior problems. The time and money for classes alone is not enough. You need to do the homework on your own time to keep the behavior in check.\n\nThere are also some little things you can try to help all dogs get on the same playing field. For example, you can exchange things that smell like the other's dogs and hold them in your home so your pets feel more familiar with each other despite not living together.\n\nIf her dogs pull, you can try a front leading harness which will turn them and hopefully help them learn pulling does not get them where they want to go.\n\nYou can have the dogs within eyesight of one another, but distanced (and not within reach of each other plus a few feet for good measure lol), while dropping treats directly on the ground in front of them. This way all dogs see the other dogs leaning down and picking up things off the ground (this behavior has the potential to make them vulnerable so its like a pseudo dog trust exercise).\n\nTo summarize, there are a lot of things you can try before you get to the \"get rid of your dogs\" conclusion. If you try multiple avenues and things still don't work then that is one thing. At this point I don't get the feeling either of  you are really problem solving, and you both seem more hurt that the other won't agree.\n\nIf you both want this to work, I think it's possible.

If she's able to prove that she's committed to training her dogs and getting them safely socialized with Johnny, then moving in and keeping her dogs could be possible. You need to communicate that you would like to live with her but you will not compromise Johnny's safety just so that she can move in AND keep her dogs.

We don\u2019t know really anything about OP\u2019s gf or her dog-training practices.", "Probably not Littermate Syndrome if they are showing interest in people on the street and there really isn't any indication of fear or people or other dogs.  OP also didn't give anything that would indicate there are any serious issues like that.  This just sounds like two big puppies who don't get enough excercise and clearly not a firm training. GSD require a VERY firm owner who doesn't let them get away with their crap or else they will take control themselves.  And they do require a lot of entertainment (play/work/training) and exercise.", "Clearly not. Emotional attachment is only ok for OP. His woman must shed all attachments to her dogs and choose him and his. But it\u2019s ok, he\u2019s fine with her going back over there to hang with her roomies dogs whenever she pleases.", "True. I worked at a dog training place and it was generally 4-8 weeks. Everything was based off how willing they (the dog) were to be trained to how many dogs the owners had to if the owner/s was willing to take in class training afterwards.", "> Yeah it's not even really a ESH situation, or a NAH. It's really just don't move together.\n\nExactly.", "I dont know...it sounds like a very informative judgmemt to me...it isnt technically one..but it should be", "Most any dog can be good apartment dogs if the owner is willing to put in the time and work. \n\nInitially I had planned on a German shepherd while living in an apartment until I was reminded of a smaller breed (45-50 lbs) that met all of my dog requirements. If you're going to have a shepherd (or any high maintenance breed) in a small space it will take a lot of work. OP's girlfriend isn't even putting in the work for basic training so I doubt she's running these dogs multiple times every day, providing mental stimulation when inside, and putting in the effort to find outdoor spaces to let the dogs run and enjoy themselves on their own time.\n\nAs the owner of a high energy breed, most of my day when I'm not working is running the dog for miles, trick training and brain teaser toys while I attempt to cook dinner, and a daily trip to an off-leash dog park/trails (she has great recall) that is about ten miles from where we live. \n\nBut, I'm also stubborn and want to prove that apartment dogs can have just as good of lives (if not better) than dogs that have a fenced in yard. A house/yard does not a good dog owner make.", "Exactly..training them may have them suppress their needs for excercise and stimulation to make their humans happy...but giving them proper space and excercise to be happy is the only way to truelly take care of these dogs", "I agree.  It doesn't sound like the GSDs are trained (I have one and they require a lot of training), but my experience is that chihuahuas are typically very aggressive.  They are small so they can get away with it, but doesn't mean they don't often cause problems.", "My GSD is afraid of the small yappy dogs at the dog park. She plays happily with nearly every dog from little dachshunds up to Irish Wolfhounds but if a small dog shows up barking and nipping she comes and hides behind me, lol.", "Agree. I have a very well trained dog who is friendly with nearly every dog she meets. The one exception is my uncle's Chihuahua who constantly antagonizes her. Because of this, my dog is viewed as the aggressive one because after an hour of getting growled and nipped at she will bite back. The issue here is my dog is 45 lbs of muscle.\n\nShe does well with all of my other family members' chihuahuas. It is just this one that has never been trained and gets away with it now because \"she's just a sweet, grumpy old lady.\"", "I think the difference in this case is that the two other dogs could kill Jonny **by accident**, let alone on purpose.", "OP sees the big fluff balls running towards his 10lb dog, of course he\u2019s nervous, I\u2019m nervous when I watch my GSD mouth and play with my cats. Doesn\u2019t mean the dogs are bad. And if these dogs are as he says is \u201cbeing puppies\u201d it means he probably doesn\u2019t  want the puppy stage of the growth as his dog is older and reaching that age of no play. Whereas well his girlfriends are still pups. If this was to even remotely work, it\u2019ll take a bunch of training between Johnny, and the GSDs. \n\nI also don\u2019t believe Johnny is a sweet little angel in the story. Based on breed and age. Getting introduced to two bigger younger dogs. The math isn\u2019t matching and OP doesn\u2019t like her dogs.", "I would still worry about if just training the german sheppards would work too?  Granted I'm no expert that's why I'm wondering here. But I would still be concerned about the 3 dogs living together even if the bigger dogs were trained.\n\nLike someone else said earlier chihuahuas can be territorial, loud and aggressive too, they just get away with it because of their size. I haven't spent a lot of time around that breed but I've been around 2 different ones for short periods of time and from what I've seen that description is spot on for them (maybe because I'm not someone those dogs were familiar with?)\n\nMy concern would be even if the german sheppards are trained if the smaller dog starts barking and posturing towards the other two maybe that result could be disastrous as well? You never know.\n\nI don't know if there could be a possibility of the couple taking all three dogs to a dog trainer to get a professional opinion on if there's any safe way for these dogs to live together but that might be worth looking into if the relationship is really worth saving?\n\nOtherwise it just really doesn't seem like a wise idea for OP and gf to live together. It's not fair to OP's older dog to traumatize him around the larger breeds. But it's really not fair to ask the gf to give up her dogs either. It sucks having to give up your pets and in my opinion should be a last resort. It's not those animals faults after all.", "Perhaps she\u2019s crying because she\u2019s been told she has to give up her dogs or give up living with her boyfriend? People tend to cry when they feel helpless and stuck in a hopeless situation.", "This seems like a very black/white way of looking at crying. Some people cry because they get overwhelmed. She is stuck between two options where she loses something she loves regardless of what she does.\n\nShe can move in with the person she loves and lose her beloved dogs, or she can stay with her beloved dogs and lose a future with the person she loves.\n\nIt could be manipulation, sure, we dont know them or their motivations. I also know that had someone put me in a similare situation I would probably cry too, simply because the choise seems impossible and overwhelming.", "I\u2019ll co-sign with the Arrow Star of Honor\u2122", "Yeah as the owner of a trained Chihuahua, my little boy still doesn't like most other dogs. He's Not aggressive most of the times as we trained him and tried the best to socialize him but there are still certain dogs he barks at every time we see them.\nChihuahuas are hard to socialize and can bei extremely stubborn. I would not be able to move another dog into my home.", "Oh my Great Dane has been attacked by small dogs, like literally we were walking out of my apartment and the neighbors had theirs off-leash and they charged at her - yeah they can only reach her ankles but she's still terrified of small dogs lol", "He\u2019s only seen her dogs a couple of times, so it seems that\u2019s he\u2019s made no effort to properly introduce the dogs to each other. It\u2019s a process and it takes time, but it can be done. I had a German Shepherd and a Belgian Malinois when I found my cat (actually, the GS found her!) who was small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. I took the time to properly introduce her and NEVER let them be together alone until I was 100% confident that they were safe. That cat was smaller than a chihuahua, and there was never an incident between her and the dogs. That cat currently trained my two new dogs (who are 75 and 100Ibs) how to act around her, LOL. And I went through the exact same process in introducing them all. OP and his GF don\u2019t live together yet, so they have time to work on introducing them. But it sounds like he is not interested in doing that at all, since he didn\u2019t say anything about it. This is beyond any training her dogs would get, which I agree they totally need. Even if they are trained and she learns how to handle them, they will still need to work on introducing them.", "Then he should never asked her to move in.", "Or she could have decided to get serious about training her dogs, and discussed an acceptable solution.", "I think her blase attitude about it, that her 'puppies are just curious' instead of them working on a plan together to integrate households and ensure the GS's are getting sufficient exercise to be cooped up in an apartment like that sort of nullify's any hope of them 'working together to introduce them' part of it.\n\nI'm not saying OPs gf is a bad person, but moving in together is a serious business, if she is disregarding her partners legitimate concerns out of hand (as OP's GF seems to be doing) then she's probably not a good investment in terms of long-time partnership. Animals aside, that's a red flag right there and OP is in the right calling a kibosh on the plan to move in together.", "He\u2019s not putting his foot down on getting them trained. He\u2019s saying he won\u2019t move forward in their relationship until she gets rid of the dog and telling her she \u201cwon\u2019t be able to see each other as often anymore.\u201d which to me sounds like if they see each other a few times a week, it\u2019ll become one time or less like he\u2019s punishing her for not getting rid of the dogs.\n\nDo dogs need to be trained? Yes, absolutely. I also grew up with shepherds. My family\u2019s current one is a rescue (former street dog) and he\u2019s extremely well trained and he was 2-3 when he was adopted.\n\nSo YTA (for OP) because instead of putting his foot down on training, or offering to train them himself if she won\u2019t, he\u2019s demanding she get rid of them or she will see him even less than she currently does. So if you don\u2019t think someone who\u2019s manipulative is an AH, idk what else to tell you"]}
