She has two german sheperds that her and her roommate looks after, both of them I've only seen a handful of times and unfortunately both dogs act aggressive (growling and snapping) towards my chihuahua Johnny. \n\nI've told her that this was a concern, I've had him for over 8 years so if anything happened to Johnny I wouldn't know what to do but she brushes it off as her dogs \"being puppies\" and that they were actually sweethearts who are just curious about him. She has had those \"puppies\" for almost two years now. Her dogs are problematic. The few times I saw her roommate walking the dogs they were getting up close and sniffing every person walking past and barking loudly at other dogs. They are clearly untrained, it's a miracle that no one complains about it. I brought up the issue and she said she was working on it but the last time I saw her dogs around in public, their behaviour haven't improved which makes me think she doesn't care and that they will continue to act the same way towards my boy Johnny.\n\nI've suggested that she leave the dogs with her roommate who seems to be the caretaker of the dogs the few times I've been over, or with the shelter because I don't think our dogs can live together safely. She won't accept it, telling me that they are hers and that they are friendly and won't ever harm my dog. I've even said that she didn't have to part with her dogs, if we lived together she could just travel to see them but she complained about the distance and how she doesn't have time to travel that far.\n\nIt was either her dogs or mine but I can't part with Johnny, so after giving her a condition that if she can't leave hers then she shouldn't live with me, she started crying. She broke down saying things like how are we going to be together in the future if I wouldn't even let her live with me. I told her over and over that she could but she just couldn't bring her dogs, and if we couldn't live together then we wouldn't be able to see each other often anymore. After an hour of her trying to convince me I lost my cool a bit and said that she should just get rid of her dogs. She got up and left and wouldn't even answer any of my calls, it's been a few days now and I'm nervous to even visit her to make up for it. She doesn't seem to care about Johnny and I think that she overreacted.

Basically, they have to live completely separated 24/7 within the same house. It\u2019s very problematic as you have to divide your time and has caused a rift in the relationship.  This has been going on for years now. I am extremely sympathetic to people\u2019s love of their pets, but having to live like that is difficult on the people and the dogs as, no matter where you are in the house, you are ignoring a pet or not able to truly relax in your home.

A hyper large dog will easily kick or trip a tiny dog which can seriously injure it.\n\nOne aggressive snap will break your chihuahuas skull.\n\nPlease keep your pup safe and do not let it live with her dogs.", "NTA because it sounds like her dogs may be a true liability. I don\u2019t just fear for your little dog, but also *you*. What is your renters insurance policy? Does it include dog bites? Many don\u2019t \u2014 even if they do, they may exclude certain breeds of dogs. Guess a common breed that isn\u2019t covered by liability insurance (and may not even be permitted in many apartments): German Shepherds. This is not random. I know the focus here is on your dog, but I\u2019m not convinced these dogs are trustworthy around people (I could be wrong). You can sometimes find additional policies to cover you, but you need to do your research. Keep in mind that if they were to bite someone in your home, you could be on the hook for that person\u2019s medical bills.\n\nOf course, there are good German Shepherds out there, but I don\u2019t trust at least 90% I\u2019ve seen (veterinarian here). They are intelligent dogs who need proper training and daily activity. When they are trained and socialized, they are *incredible* dogs. Unfortunately, many people get dogs who do not fit their lifestyle. Behavior issues are far too common, and the pandemic has not helped the situation.\n\nInjuries between dogs of different sizes are so common we actually have an acronym for it: \u201cBDLD,\u201d meaning \u201cbig dog, little dog.\u201d The injuries can be horrifying and fatal, and it only takes a few seconds. It\u2019s why I\u2019m not a fan of public dog parks. I\u2019ve seen too much of what can happen there, and I\u2019m not willing to risk it myself.\n\nI do find it odd that it sounds like you\u2019ve only spent a minimal amount of time with these dogs but are about to move in together. Why is that? Moving in together is a very big step, and as described I don\u2019t think the necessary conversations and compromises have been adequately discussed. I understand she may be upset and find the conversation difficult, and it\u2019s obviously likely that it won\u2019t go as she plans. I think a reasonable compromise is to *postpone* moving together (and definitely let her know that it\u2019s temporary until her dogs are safe), and for her to start working with a dog trainer, obedience classes, whatever is necessary. I\u2019m not talking about one or two classes, but a weekly routine for a minimum of a few months. There\u2019s no guarantee it will be enough at this point, but it\u2019s the only way to try. If she\u2019s not willing to train the dogs (and/or the dogs don\u2019t respond positively to training), then don\u2019t move in together. Simple as that. The ball is in her court.\n\nEdit to add: I don\u2019t think I said this explicitly enough, but many dogs like German Shepherds need daily exercise. Even if their training is perfect, if they don\u2019t get their energy out, they can be a nightmare. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case here. If it becomes apparent that these dogs need multiple daily walks to stay behaved, she will need to stick with that routine. You may even want to get a commitment from her in writing (a sort of \u201croommate agreement\u201d where you both commit to whatever routine seems reasonable). Too many people move in together assuming you\u2019ll just \u201cfigure it out\u201d but then are disappointed they aren\u2019t doing their fair share of the household chores.", "I have to question the intelligence and judgement of anyone who owns two German Shepherds and lives in an apartment.

He\u2019s already moved to a new apartment, and has invited her to join him, essentially on the basis that she does not bring her dogs, or she provides extensive training for them before moving in to make them safe around his dog.", "Her dogs are a hazard to OP's dog and gf seems like an irresponsible dog owner, that's her responsibility (training/costs) to manage not OP's. There's no way gf can move in with her dogs without OP's dog and maybe OP being in danger.", "They're not his dogs.", "Her dogs are not his responsibility, his dog, however is and he\u2019s putting his dogs needs first. He\u2019s not wrong for saying he refuses to put his dog on the line. She\u2019s refused to train them in no way is he the asshole.", "You want OP to train two German shepherds or pay for their training when the actual owner(s) aren't being responsible dog owners? Why? Why shouldn't the actual owners be responsible for that?\n\nIt sounds like a reasonable boundary to not want two untrained and potentially dangerous dogs in your home, even doubly so with a smaller and older dog around. \n\nI agree it sucked to say she should get rid of the dogs, even if it was in a moment of frustration. But this is not a question of deciding between her partner and her dogs but between living with her dogs or living with her partner. There's nothing stopping them from keeping their living arrangements as is and postpone living together until they can find a compromise.\n\nIf OP got the new apartment with the express purpose of moving in together than this is a conversation they should have had way before they started looking for an apartment.", "No way would I give up my dog so a romantic partner could move in.", "Get rid of his 8 year old chihuahua? Fuck off", "The problem with that is that the giving it a shot could cost OP's dogs live.", "Exactly, pet ownership or planning to adopt are among the first questions I ask. She had those dogs for 2 years and OP had no idea it's a package deal when moving in together, lol", "Don\u2019t read? He doesn\u2019t want them because they act aggressively towards other animals and people they are clearly not trained. Before making a decision read the story", "You just pointed out why having 2 GSD in a small apt is a terrible idea.", "I'm not sure what your point is? Or if you actually read the full question? She might be attempting to train them, but the fact remains that they ARE currently badly behaved. He has a tiny dog of his own, one that wouldn't stand a chance against even one, never mind two German shepherds. Surely, as a responsible dog owner yourself you're not suggesting he should either A: give up his own dog, or B: risk throwing them together like she wants and hope for the best? If anyone is refusing to see the reality of the situation, it's his girlfriend, not him.", "She IS asking him to. Her 'puppies' (they're 2, not puppies anymore just badly trained) would kill his dog with one snap. Should he really take that risk??", "This!!! I'd give you an award, but alas, I am Reddit poor, so you'll just have to settle for the upvote and my unending admiration...", "Facts.", "I didn't say he did. All I'm saying is it's not fair that she has to give up her dogs. Either both of you come up with a compromise which leads to both of you keeping your dogs safe or don't move in together. This should have been discussed before planning to have her move in.", "Then you choose option 3, simple", "Right?!", "I did read. And I stand by my statement. If he doesn\u2019t want the dogs, he doesn\u2019t have to date her. Get your head out of your asshole\n\nEdit: I dated a girl who\u2019s dog was absolutely terrible and not trained and I hated it.

You can cosign on it!", "Are you telling yourself that?? Untrained dogs who are aggressive can become a risk to everyone.. if the dogs attack a human then they suffer the consequences", "It's not about not wanting the dogs. The issue is that the dogs could attack and hurt his smaller dog. So yes, maybe they can get them trained up and then move them back into the home. You can't just say \"get it some training\" like that can happen instantly and eliminate the risk to OPs dog. And your warm up your mom's leftovers is just petty and mean.", "Bro get a life", "\u201cI\u2019ve only seen them a handful of times\u201d so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been seeing them regularly for years acting poorly\n\n\u201cThey barked at another dog, they\u2019re clearly untrained\u201d - most dogs bark. And his solution is to get rid of the dogs over training them? So every time I walk my family\u2019s shepherd (who almost never barks), I should tell the people in the neighborhood who\u2019s dogs bark on walks that their dogs are untrained and they need to get rid of them? Or that they\u2019re \u201cdangerous\u201d \ud83e\udd74\n\n\u201cThey snapped at my dog\u201d well chihuahuas are well known for being aggressive dogs, especially when it comes to bigger dogs. So in this extremely rare chance that this one is the Angel he claims it, there\u2019s a good chance his dog did something to trigger one of the dogs. Which happens, I\u2019ve seen two good dogs meet and one snaps at the other because they didn\u2019t like where the dog\u2019s nose went.\n\nIMO, this guy is an incredibly ignorant and arrogant dog owner who\u2019s actually clueless when it comes to dog ownership.", " Bro ur literally on Reddit right now going back and forth.

That little dog is broken-necked mincemeat if the GSDs decided to do so much play a little rough, never mind seriously attack him.
