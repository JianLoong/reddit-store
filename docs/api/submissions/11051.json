She has two german sheperds that her and her roommate looks after, both of them I've only seen a handful of times and unfortunately both dogs act aggressive (growling and snapping) towards my chihuahua Johnny. \n\nI've told her that this was a concern, I've had him for over 8 years so if anything happened to Johnny I wouldn't know what to do but she brushes it off as her dogs \"being puppies\" and that they were actually sweethearts who are just curious about him. She has had those \"puppies\" for almost two years now. Her dogs are problematic. The few times I saw her roommate walking the dogs they were getting up close and sniffing every person walking past and barking loudly at other dogs. They are clearly untrained, it's a miracle that no one complains about it. I brought up the issue and she said she was working on it but the last time I saw her dogs around in public, their behaviour haven't improved which makes me think she doesn't care and that they will continue to act the same way towards my boy Johnny.\n\nI've suggested that she leave the dogs with her roommate who seems to be the caretaker of the dogs the few times I've been over, or with the shelter because I don't think our dogs can live together safely. She won't accept it, telling me that they are hers and that they are friendly and won't ever harm my dog. I've even said that she didn't have to part with her dogs, if we lived together she could just travel to see them but she complained about the distance and how she doesn't have time to travel that far.\n\nIt was either her dogs or mine but I can't part with Johnny, so after giving her a condition that if she can't leave hers then she shouldn't live with me, she started crying. She broke down saying things like how are we going to be together in the future if I wouldn't even let her live with me. I told her over and over that she could but she just couldn't bring her dogs, and if we couldn't live together then we wouldn't be able to see each other often anymore. After an hour of her trying to convince me I lost my cool a bit and said that she should just get rid of her dogs. She got up and left and wouldn't even answer any of my calls, it's been a few days now and I'm nervous to even visit her to make up for it. She doesn't seem to care about Johnny and I think that she overreacted.

Basically, they have to live completely separated 24/7 within the same house. It\u2019s very problematic as you have to divide your time and has caused a rift in the relationship.  This has been going on for years now. I am extremely sympathetic to people\u2019s love of their pets, but having to live like that is difficult on the people and the dogs as, no matter where you are in the house, you are ignoring a pet or not able to truly relax in your home.

Just because you don\u2019t like them or see how she works with them doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t.

A hyper large dog will easily kick or trip a tiny dog which can seriously injure it.\n\nOne aggressive snap will break your chihuahuas skull.\n\nPlease keep your pup safe and do not let it live with her dogs.", "NTA because it sounds like her dogs may be a true liability. I don\u2019t just fear for your little dog, but also *you*. What is your renters insurance policy? Does it include dog bites? Many don\u2019t \u2014 even if they do, they may exclude certain breeds of dogs. Guess a common breed that isn\u2019t covered by liability insurance (and may not even be permitted in many apartments): German Shepherds. This is not random. I know the focus here is on your dog, but I\u2019m not convinced these dogs are trustworthy around people (I could be wrong). You can sometimes find additional policies to cover you, but you need to do your research. Keep in mind that if they were to bite someone in your home, you could be on the hook for that person\u2019s medical bills.\n\nOf course, there are good German Shepherds out there, but I don\u2019t trust at least 90% I\u2019ve seen (veterinarian here). They are intelligent dogs who need proper training and daily activity. When they are trained and socialized, they are *incredible* dogs. Unfortunately, many people get dogs who do not fit their lifestyle. Behavior issues are far too common, and the pandemic has not helped the situation.\n\nInjuries between dogs of different sizes are so common we actually have an acronym for it: \u201cBDLD,\u201d meaning \u201cbig dog, little dog.\u201d The injuries can be horrifying and fatal, and it only takes a few seconds. It\u2019s why I\u2019m not a fan of public dog parks. I\u2019ve seen too much of what can happen there, and I\u2019m not willing to risk it myself.\n\nI do find it odd that it sounds like you\u2019ve only spent a minimal amount of time with these dogs but are about to move in together. Why is that? Moving in together is a very big step, and as described I don\u2019t think the necessary conversations and compromises have been adequately discussed. I understand she may be upset and find the conversation difficult, and it\u2019s obviously likely that it won\u2019t go as she plans. I think a reasonable compromise is to *postpone* moving together (and definitely let her know that it\u2019s temporary until her dogs are safe), and for her to start working with a dog trainer, obedience classes, whatever is necessary. I\u2019m not talking about one or two classes, but a weekly routine for a minimum of a few months. There\u2019s no guarantee it will be enough at this point, but it\u2019s the only way to try. If she\u2019s not willing to train the dogs (and/or the dogs don\u2019t respond positively to training), then don\u2019t move in together. Simple as that. The ball is in her court.\n\nEdit to add: I don\u2019t think I said this explicitly enough, but many dogs like German Shepherds need daily exercise. Even if their training is perfect, if they don\u2019t get their energy out, they can be a nightmare. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case here. If it becomes apparent that these dogs need multiple daily walks to stay behaved, she will need to stick with that routine. You may even want to get a commitment from her in writing (a sort of \u201croommate agreement\u201d where you both commit to whatever routine seems reasonable). Too many people move in together assuming you\u2019ll just \u201cfigure it out\u201d but then are disappointed they aren\u2019t doing their fair share of the household chores.", "I have to question the intelligence and judgement of anyone who owns two German Shepherds and lives in an apartment.

But you have to respect that just as you aren't willing to part with your dog, she isn't willing to part with hers (even if she's a shitty owner).    \nI think it was okay to ask her to consider leaving them with the roommate, but you went too far.", "NTA for looking after your dog's safety and well-being (which is obviously what you are doing here), but you shouldn't be together if you want to move in with one another. She's clearly not budging, neither are you, and this is not a safe situation. Also, it sounds like she has pretty good judgment if she thought getting 2 German shepherds and not training them was a good idea.", "The compromise actually seems easy to me\u2026.\n\n\u201cI cannot and will not live with untrained dogs. They are a danger to me, my dog, and my overall sanity.  You need to take them to obedience school, and work with them on your own as well. Once they are capable of (list any/all requirements you have to deem them \u201cwell trained\u201d) then we can revisit the idea of moving in together at that point\u201d. \n\nIf this compromise isn\u2019t acceptable, then the relationship is likely to fail regardless.", "Not just any untrained dogs - but shepherds!

She just dismissed his issues.", "She also refused to train them and said \"they are just puppies\". If you love an animal you educate yourself and take proper care of them. If the dogs attack anyone, they would be put down. And she doesn't do anything to prevent this possibility. How is that love?\n\nDogs and cats and pets in general aren't just for cute photos and videos, they need proper care. She shouldn't have animals she can't properly care for.", "Why is it a red flag?", "And an apartment isn\u2019t a proper home for a German Shepherd, let alone two of them. My granddaughter has a GS (I\u2019m a bit afraid of dogs but this one is the bestest girl) and the dog spends a lot of her day in their backyard chasing squirrels, sniffing around, doing zoomies, and napping in her favorite shady spot. My granddaughter also walks her twice a day. I can\u2019t imagine that dog cooped up in an apartment all day. No wonder they don\u2019t behave well when out in public! Training them might help but I still don\u2019t think an apartment is fair to the dog.", "True, but this is OP\u2019s side and he clearly hates her dogs and states he hasn\u2019t seen them much.", "Training for the chihuahua too. They are such little assholes.", "OP\u2019s \u201cevidence\u201d that they\u2019re untrained is that they sniff other dogs (which all dogs do) and bark at other dogs (which dogs do when they\u2019re playing).

I just don't see where it said in the post that she \"refused\" to train her dogs. I already said in my comment that she is a shitty dog owner for not training her dogs already. But there is nothing in the post that says she refuses to train them. She said she is working on it. There is not enough context on what that means.", "We got one of our shepherds from a lady who didn\u2019t realize they weren\u2019t good apartment dogs. He spent basically the first week outside in the yard (unless we dragged him in at night) and would pace constantly if we tried to keep him inside. He\u2019s calmed down significantly since then, and likes to be inside now that he knows he can go out whenever.", "No an apartment is not good for German Shepherds. My mom has one and he\u2019s definitely a house dog. She lives on acreage and tries to get him outside. He has zero interest in squirrels. Only outside time he likes is laying on the porch in the sun during summer. He\u2019s just lazy. He still would not enjoy an apartment.", "Can you really blame this guy for not wanting two 50+ lb aggressive, bonded dogs sharing an *apartment* with his 6 pound chihuaha? Thats not love or hate, it's bloody logic. If his partner isn't willing to make a plan, and is hoping for the best, his hands are tied.", "The gf isn\u2019t the caretaker of her dogs. Her roommate is. And I can guarantee the roommate isn\u2019t thrilled about this. They do it because otherwise the dogs would be neglected", "It's where two puppies - usually from the same litter, but can also be from different litters and close in age - are raised together during the development years. Oftentimes, people incorrectly get two puppies because they think they will teach each other. Which, they must certainly can, but then the owners forgo proper training or individual training. This results in puppies that are unhealthily bonded together. Separation anxiety and aggression are most common. Quality breeders usually do not let two puppies go home together unless the owners have an extensive plan in place to avoid this developing. \n\nI have seen it first hand with an (ex) friend impulsively bought two beagle puppies from a pet store. Dumped them together and did pretty much no training. The one became very hostile and aggressive to people and the sibling. The sibling on the other hand was very meek and was a bit underweight from the other resource guarding the food. She ended up rehoming the mean one and the meek one flourished. But, within a few days the adopters called her wanting to return the mean one because he was refusing to eat or drink and had bitten their child. Took it back and then sold them to a hunter who used beagles and felt he could fix the issue. Was truly crazy to see the puppies' behavior to people and each other.", "If you have two puppies from the same litter (or not even the same litter, but just both pretty young) at the same time, they can develop some really crappy behaviors.", "It's implied. He says that he has talked to her before about his concerns regarding their behaviour and she brushes it off. Also, when you own a dog like that it's your responsibility to train them, you don't have to be made to do it. And she hasn't done it in two years, there was ample time. She is not only putting others, both dogs and people, in danger but her own dogs as well. If they attack someone the dogs will be put down and she will be sued for damages. She doesn't care for their wellbeing or the legal liability.\n\nETA: He also says it explicitly. He says they are untrained he brought up the issue, and no improvement was seen.", "I like the cut of your jib.", "and who's to say that OPs view of the situation is perfect, he doesn't live with girlfriend and girlfriend roommate.\n\nDoes he know the exact way they each take care of the dogs?\n\nIs OP scared due to stereotypes some big dogs hold?\n\nYou can't just claim the dogs would be neglected", "Oh wow! That is nuts!"]}
