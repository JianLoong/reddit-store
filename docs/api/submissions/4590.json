It's emotionally incestuous.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for your fiance and your relationship, and for setting boundaries with your mother. Those are clearly warranted in this situation.", "NTA.  Mom is entitled to her opinion.  You have made it clear you don't want to hear her opinion on the subject of your fiance anymore.  Until Mom is respectful enough to honor your request going non-contact is fair enough.", "NTA. This isn't about choosing one person over another - this is about saying that some behavior is simply unacceptable, no matter whom it is from. You did the absolute correct thing - and you were correct calling your mother's behavior immature and despicable. Your fiancee is a saint for putting up with this, and you are a good person for standing with her.\n\nThe excuse that \"mother is just being mother\" is just enabling inexcusable behavior - and that is just as bad as the behavior itself.", "NTA at all, it\u2019s really important that you stand up for your fianc\u00e9e", "NTA- Kuddos to you for standing up for your fianc\u00e9!!! You are doing exactly as you should. If your mother cannot hold her tongue and be civil then she doesn\u2019t need to come around.

Your sister's excuse of \"mom just being mom\" doesn't work, as she too is an adult and should by now be able to manage her own behavior.

Your mom doesn\u2019t need to be invited to anything you and your fianc\u00e9 are hosting if this is how incredibly disrespectful she acts. 8 years is way long enough time for her to stop acting so disrespectful and rude to her. Until she can admit and genuinely apologize for this nasty behavior, I would either go LC or NC. She won\u2019t change anything and will on get worse as you two start planning your wedding!!
