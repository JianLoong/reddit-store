I assume she knew you were saving up for this, yeah? You say in comments that your GF spends a lot of money on clothes and other frivolities, which is fine, her right and her prerogative. But you saved your money so you could go to this restaurant. That\u2019s your right and your prerogative. If she wanted to accompany you, then she should have set aside some of her funds so she could attend. She did not, so if she can\u2019t afford to now go, that was her choice.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should be obligated to pay for her, or to postpone your plans when she presumably had ample time to save like you did but chose not to. Would her plan be to start saving now? How long would that take? And would she stick to the commitment of saving? It\u2019s inconsiderate of her to expect you to cancel your plans just because she chose not to attend. You\u2019re allowed to have a fun time without your partner, especially when you saved up for it and she had the opportunity to do the same but chose not to.", "NTA. If she wont tell you WHY it is inconsiderate than she probably doesn't know either. If she just isn't willing to spend the money, than that is on her. You're free to spend your own money how you like.", "NTA. She\u2019s wanting you to pay.", "NTA - she's unreasonably entitled if she thinks you're obligated to pay for her.  Must you buy her a car if you get one?  Her a gown if you buy a suit?", "Not the asshole. She shouldn't expect you to pay for her and if it's something you enjoy doing she shouldn't stop you. I don't think you should feel bad, you deserve to enjoy yourself", "Nta. This is an experience that to you is worth 500. Clearly it isn\u2019t to her, or she would have said yes. She has no right to be mad.", "NTA. It\u2019s healthy to do things apart from your partner. Particularly if you\u2019ve been together for awhile. If this is a restaurant you wanted to try, you should be able to go. You offered her a spot in the reservation, she declined, end of story. You\u2019re not married yet and certainly do not need to pay $1000 for both of you. If she wanted to go, she could make the effort to save up for the night. \n\nYour girl is handling this pretty immaturely and selfishly.

That sort of dining isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, regardless of who pays for it.\n\nShe\u2019s being passive aggressive.  She can flat out say she can\u2019t afford it, leaving it up to you to counter with offering to pay.  Or not.  Nothing says you are required to pay for her meal.  But where is this culinary Mecca?  Cuz I would be down for that and could pay my own way.", "NTA. It\u2019s likely that she\u2019s feeling a little hurt that you\u2019d rather spend more on an experience for yourself without her than split the cost on a less-expensive meal with her, combined with some normal jealousy and FOMO. I\u2019d suggest doing a special movie night at home or something interesting along those lines as well so she feels like she\u2019s getting enough quality time with you. Or if you can spring for a theater ticket, The Menu would be the perfect date-night movie.", "NTA you asked her to go, she said no. You still want to go and try and it you\u2019re going with friends. Don\u2019t really see the issue here.", "NTA\n\nJust because you\u2019re in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend every waking hour together or experience everything together. This is something you want to do and she doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure if you paid she would go, but your comments express that this is not something she would want to splurge on like you would. It\u2019s okay to have different interests. Go have a great time. \n\nFrom the post and comments this is something that you\u2019ve wanted to do for awhile. You check this specific restaurant regularly and something came up. She has 2 months to save if she wanted to be a part of this experience with you. She could afford it if she wanted to. This really reads that she\u2019s upset that you won\u2019t foot the bill. There\u2019s time to save but she would rather spend elsewhere but still have this experience with you as long as you pay. \n\nYou say she goes out with friends, are you always invited? Do you always attend? Or does do things independently without you? This is no different for you. You sacrifice to have this experience because you want the experience. She won\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You\u2019re not inconsiderate and you\u2019re doing nothing wrong.

It'd be great if she was able to communicate better how she's feeling to you but she also doesn't owe you an explanation every time she has a feeling, do you know how exhausting that is on top of when you already feel shitty? Not to mention it isn't always something you can pinpoint to a specific logical root cause even for the person feeling it. Or maybe she doesn't want to have to say out loud the reason because bring upset you aren't going to go to a special event for a reason you can control isn't something everyone wants to admit to. Does it matter why though? Unless you have a suggestion to change the situation I imagine if she were to tell you why, you'd try to argue on why she's unjustified in feeling that way.

At first I thought what a dick!  If you want to go to a nice place and your girlfriend can't afford it then you should foot the bill and share the experience.

Then I remember my husband telling me a story of having a fancy meal in a restaurant like that back the 70's and if he is still talking about it I'm sure it was worth every cent for the memory. I think that the only thing you did that she may consider wrong is book the table before talking it over with her first.

But, if the OP all of a sudden decided to invite and pay for her, then she could feel like it was just his idea to treat her.\n\nI would indeed generalize it as it is good relationship behavior to both directly explain what one wants, and to directly explain why one is upset if that happens.

However, I have to ask is your friend a guy or girl? If your friend is a girl, that may be why she sees it as inconsiderate, or if this is something you were both planning to do together for a long time she may be feeling a bit excluded and neglected. I don\u2019t want to make assumptions but perhaps you should ask her specifically why she sees it as inconsiderate after all communication is key and it may help you understand why she is upset.", "Your gf sounds immature.

You're free to still go.\n\nSounds like she wants to play mind games. Does she frequently try to guilt trip you like this?", "NTA how old is she? She needs to be more mature and express her emotions.Not the passive aggressive go then guilting you for going. If she\u2019s that upset she needs to explain why and express herself. Not do toxic ish and guilt you for going after saying you can go", "I can't justify that much for a dinner. I just... I can't do it.\n\nI would look at that bill and think about all the things that money could buy that I'd rather have. \n\nIf my partner wanted to blow that much on a meal I'd resent it if I went for that reason, but I'd also have a little resentment if she went without me that our priorities weren't aligned. But I'd get over it.\n\nThere are no assholes here. Your feelings are both valid.

Next time go to a dinner like this and don't invite her?", "Right. That\u2019s a good possibility. \n\nParticularly if the girlfriend is the type to show pride in her frugality. Like my mom and MIL who like to show off how much they save at sales, and balk at the idea of us spending x amount on \u2026 just about anything. Lol. They also turn up their noses at the thought of designer anything.  \n\nOP values the experience and feels it\u2019s worth it. GF May not see the value and see it as a waste of money. She may even be wondering how this will translate over into *marriage* and if they have the same values when it comes to that fraught topic. \n\nOP NTA.\n\n But I hope while you\u2019re still in the dating stage, you guys have serious discussions about money to see if you\u2019re on the same page.", ">he sounds like the AH here because he just made a reserve for 4 people he didn't name.\n\nWhy is that a bad thing?", "It doesn\u2019t even matter that he didn\u2019t have a group to with which to go when he made the reservation. The point is he wanted to go, and got a reservation. He asked gf first if she wanted to go, so, obviously he thought of her when planning. However, she declined. \n\nI saw your comment about glitter and gold\u2026 It\u2019s pretty judgmental about the fact he can afford to go. He\u2019s frugal in his spending day to day to be able to afford these experiences. She is not. They have different financial priorities. He wants to go, and can afford to pay for himself. Maybe he can\u2019t afford to pay for her too. So, he should not be allowed to do something he wants to do because she can\u2019t afford it? He made it clear from the beginning everyone would pay their own way. \n\nThe only way I\u2019d say he\u2019s the AH is if they shared, which it does not sound like they do, their finances. Like if he is using joint money to do it, and doesn\u2019t consider the fact there is not enough for both of them to go. However, it sounds like they both support themselves. She spends her money the way she likes, he doesn\u2019t dictate to her how she should spend it. She shouldn\u2019t dictate to him either.

I\u2019m not saying she\u2019d be right but at least we would know what the problem is. He\u2019s asking for advice.", "This comment (and a couple of other ones) makes me think your stance on not paying for her to accompany you to dinner is more about your feelings on how she spends her money.  It is quite clear you disapprove of what she says money on, despite stating you would never tell her how to spend her money, and that deciding not to pay for this meal is a punishment for her not being more frugal.\n\nIt can be expensive to be a woman - make up, grooming and hygiene products and services can add up very quickly, not to mention the pink tax. \n\nYou also said that she is a teacher.  From my friends who are teachers, it is a very time consuming job that goes way beyond normal office hours.  If this is the case, I can understand that things like meal planning can be put on the back burner.   Very busy people tend to value their personal time over money.  I say this because of your comment that she buys her lunch and your feeling that this is not a good choice to spend money on.  It may be that she would rather spend her free time doing other things than grocery shopping, meal prep and cooking and clean up for homemade lunches.  You have said you earn more than her, but it is not clear if you both cohabit.  Are her outgoing expenses more than yours in relation to her living arrangements? How practical is it for her to cut her spending to be able to save at the same rate as you? What would she need to sacrifice in her life to be able to do that? \n\nAre you obligated to pay for her lunch? No.  But it was a bit of a dick move to invite her knowing it was very unlikely she could afford to go.  Should you have to avoid having 5 star experiences because your partner can\u2019t afford them? No, but don\u2019t be surprised that she is disappointed and upset with you when you do these things with out her and feels that her company is something you have put a dollar value on.\n\nIf you both have very different values on what you both prioritise in your lives, this relationship may not have longevity.", "Do you live together OP? If so I do see how she'd be upset.", "It \"SEEMED to work fine\" or \"it DID work fine\" in the end?\n\nI am not blaming you for jumping the gun for an available reservation for a place you wanted to go to.\n\n Just try to understand your GFs sadness from the overall situation. If my BF made a reservation for a place he could afford and I couldn't,  then asked me if I wanted to go and I couldn't because I couldn't afford it,  I'd be upset too. \n\nOverall, I  don't think either of you are AH. You both just  need to communicate better.", "No, invite her and tell her how much it's going to cost her and let her decide if she's cool with a meal that cost $500. Then, be OK that she's a reasonable person and declines.", "If you do experience telepathy stop taking love immediately and call your doctor. Love is not meant to be used with any other emotions.", "I absolutely do not think he should not go.\n\nI'm more annoyed that people are starting to call his GF an AH for being upset because, again,  he made the reservation THEN told her the price. \n\nSome  people just can't afford some edible gold glitter from a craft store on a steak that costs $500+", "I'm saying that he just made the reservation without even knowing the 4 people who would actually go. That's why he asked his GF after the reservation if she wanted to go. \n\nMost restaurants don't even seat people until their full party is present (and I doubt this one would), so he just asked people, including his GF, to fill the seats", "I pay for stuff all the time. $500 isn't something I just casually throw around.", "I only discussed her spending to illustrate that we have different priorities for our money. She places more value on quality of life and I place more value on unique experiences.\n\nI understand it can be expensive to be a woman, but I think I have to draw the line somewhere.

That's unreasonable and makes her TA here.", "And he successfully filled all the seats. So why is this a bad thing?\n\nHe was able to fill the seats without his GF so it's not like he was pressuring her to go.", "So she could save the money with slight discomfort if she wanted to share this experience with OP. She doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s necessary so why is OP the bad guy?", "You're not going to Michelin star restaurants all the time. The fact that you consider paying to take your girlfriend as just casually throwing around money is very telling.", "He actually has stated multiple times that he was not saving specifically for this he is just in general a bit more frugal with his finances.

It's understandable that she'd feel a little sad/jealous.
