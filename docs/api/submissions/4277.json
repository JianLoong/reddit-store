I assume she knew you were saving up for this, yeah? You say in comments that your GF spends a lot of money on clothes and other frivolities, which is fine, her right and her prerogative. But you saved your money so you could go to this restaurant. That\u2019s your right and your prerogative. If she wanted to accompany you, then she should have set aside some of her funds so she could attend. She did not, so if she can\u2019t afford to now go, that was her choice.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should be obligated to pay for her, or to postpone your plans when she presumably had ample time to save like you did but chose not to. Would her plan be to start saving now? How long would that take? And would she stick to the commitment of saving? It\u2019s inconsiderate of her to expect you to cancel your plans just because she chose not to attend. You\u2019re allowed to have a fun time without your partner, especially when you saved up for it and she had the opportunity to do the same but chose not to.", "NTA. If she wont tell you WHY it is inconsiderate than she probably doesn't know either. If she just isn't willing to spend the money, than that is on her. You're free to spend your own money how you like.", "NTA. She\u2019s wanting you to pay.", "NTA - she's unreasonably entitled if she thinks you're obligated to pay for her.  Must you buy her a car if you get one?  Her a gown if you buy a suit?", "Not the asshole. She shouldn't expect you to pay for her and if it's something you enjoy doing she shouldn't stop you. I don't think you should feel bad, you deserve to enjoy yourself", "Nta. This is an experience that to you is worth 500. Clearly it isn\u2019t to her, or she would have said yes. She has no right to be mad.", "NTA. It\u2019s healthy to do things apart from your partner. Particularly if you\u2019ve been together for awhile. If this is a restaurant you wanted to try, you should be able to go. You offered her a spot in the reservation, she declined, end of story. You\u2019re not married yet and certainly do not need to pay $1000 for both of you. If she wanted to go, she could make the effort to save up for the night. \n\nYour girl is handling this pretty immaturely and selfishly.

That sort of dining isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, regardless of who pays for it.\n\nShe\u2019s being passive aggressive.  She can flat out say she can\u2019t afford it, leaving it up to you to counter with offering to pay.  Or not.  Nothing says you are required to pay for her meal.  But where is this culinary Mecca?  Cuz I would be down for that and could pay my own way.", "NTA. It\u2019s likely that she\u2019s feeling a little hurt that you\u2019d rather spend more on an experience for yourself without her than split the cost on a less-expensive meal with her, combined with some normal jealousy and FOMO. I\u2019d suggest doing a special movie night at home or something interesting along those lines as well so she feels like she\u2019s getting enough quality time with you. Or if you can spring for a theater ticket, The Menu would be the perfect date-night movie.", "NTA you asked her to go, she said no. You still want to go and try and it you\u2019re going with friends. Don\u2019t really see the issue here.", "NTA\n\nJust because you\u2019re in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend every waking hour together or experience everything together.

It\u2019s okay to have different interests. Go have a great time. \n\nFrom the post and comments this is something that you\u2019ve wanted to do for awhile. You check this specific restaurant regularly and something came up. She has 2 months to save if she wanted to be a part of this experience with you. She could afford it if she wanted to. This really reads that she\u2019s upset that you won\u2019t foot the bill. There\u2019s time to save but she would rather spend elsewhere but still have this experience with you as long as you pay. \n\nYou say she goes out with friends, are you always invited? Do you always attend? Or does do things independently without you? This is no different for you. You sacrifice to have this experience because you want the experience. She won\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You\u2019re not inconsiderate and you\u2019re doing nothing wrong.

It'd be great if she was able to communicate better how she's feeling to you but she also doesn't owe you an explanation every time she has a feeling, do you know how exhausting that is on top of when you already feel shitty? Not to mention it isn't always something you can pinpoint to a specific logical root cause even for the person feeling it. Or maybe she doesn't want to have to say out loud the reason because bring upset you aren't going to go to a special event for a reason you can control isn't something everyone wants to admit to. Does it matter why though? Unless you have a suggestion to change the situation I imagine if she were to tell you why, you'd try to argue on why she's unjustified in feeling that way.

Then I remember my husband telling me a story of having a fancy meal in a restaurant like that back the 70's and if he is still talking about it I'm sure it was worth every cent for the memory. I think that the only thing you did that she may consider wrong is book the table before talking it over with her first.

But, if the OP all of a sudden decided to invite and pay for her, then she could feel like it was just his idea to treat her.\n\nI would indeed generalize it as it is good relationship behavior to both directly explain what one wants, and to directly explain why one is upset if that happens.

That guess is to her, super expensive dinners are indicative of a date.

Either way, the issue is the communication breakdown, which seems to be happening on her part in this situation.

You should ask yourself why your girl can't be happy for you to have a good time for an evening. Who needs this kind of drama at home?", "OPs replies are petty snarky and defensive for someone who doesn't think they did anything wrong. Either that or he has resting-jackass-mouth", "Bro you are good. My partner and I have different financial priorities. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it to pay for something that I want to eat or do, so I pay for him because I want to have the experience with him. But that\u2019s stuff that costs way less than a $500 meal. It\u2019s like I want to get door dash but he thinks it\u2019s too pricey so I offer to pay the delivery fee or whatever. \n\nBut there are also times where the thing I want to experience is not only not something he prioritizes, but also not something I can justify spending money on just because I want him there. Like I went to a concert that was almost $300, he didn\u2019t care for the artist, but he would have gone if I paid for him, but to me it would be too much to spend on something he wasn\u2019t entirely enthusiastic about. So I went by myself and he was totally fine with it. \n\nYour logic makes total sense. And you don\u2019t sound like a petty asshole at all. Full stop.", "Ok, pass bc you take your truck camping.

All those expenses are optional luxuries.

She\u2019s spending on what she wants with her extra money. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re mad she doesn\u2019t offer to pay for you to go to the salon. \n\nYou prioritize what\u2019s \u2018worth the money\u2019 differently, but are each spending equivalent fun money on stuff that is worth it to you.", "How does a teacher go out for lunch every day? Every school I\u2019ve ever seen gives 20-30 minutes tops for lunch unless I was lucky enough to have planning period to coincide with lunch. I still wasn\u2019t allowed to leave campus without permission and signing out, and certainly not allowed every day. Where is this amazing place that has such flexibility, I want to teach there!?", "Honestly, I think you need to think about your compatibility with this person given these different priorities. Neither of you are dicks in how you spend your money- it doesn\u2019t really sound like she is living outside her means and contributes equally on the less extravagant activities.  \n\nOver our relationship I have out earned my now husband 2 to 1.  I would never expect him to give up what he sees as basic comforts (otherwise known as comics) to be able to afford things I could afford.  I enjoyed his company and special experiences were more special to me if he was by my side so I didn\u2019t mind paying for him.  \n\nWhen you extended the invitation to dinner did you explain why you wanted her to pay her share this time?

I drive a busted ass Nissan, but I\u2019ve been to the French Laundry.", "This isn\u2019t a typical hey do you want to go to dinner Friday night type dinner. It is an event.

I told them the cost, and they were not expecting me to pay for them. \n\nI think this expectation of the inviter pays for the invitees has cultural, class, and relationship specific dimensions.", "I think they get delivery a lot but sometimes one of the teachers will go pick up food for everyone", "Um, it's a big ask for a $500  dinner. I think if he wants to go large, he does *have* to pay for her.

You've been together for 2 years, that's a pretty commited relationship. Going out to dinner is definitely a boyfriend/girlfriend activity. Yet here you are going without her to an amazing restaurant. One that she has decined to go to, you say, because she can't afford it. If I were you and I really cared about this girl I'd either stump up for her meal or cancel the reservation until one of you can afford to pay for her.

I really want to understand and I would really appreciate if you take the time to help me along.\u201d\n\nThis gives her time to reflect on her own feelings and opens up communication without judgment.

An d as you say, you've taken her out to many nice dinners. So she is thinking - this is an even nicer dinner, why is he going with someone else and not me? Whereas for you, a 3 star Michelin restaurant isn't quite in the same category as a 'nice date', it is a lifetime experience to have and (hopefully) an amazing experience. She doesn't have that perspective. So talk and communicate more. Tell her that, for you, this is as if an amazing rare bag became available and this is your chance to get it (the analogy to shopping, which she enjoys and spends her money on).

I haven't spent even $50 on a dinner for myself, but have topped that on gifts to friends.\n\n\nBasically,  my view is that if you're willing to spend $500 on a dinner for yourself. It's not inconceivable to spend the same on your girlfriend as a special treat for the two of you.

She doesn't want to come right out and say it, so is being passive aggressive. These are all her own issues and you are not doing anything wrong.", "IF you can't see your girlfriend's point of view, you have problems here. I;d say YTA here... and a $500 one.", "Ah yes, equality happened.  I remember the day fondly.  It's so nice everything is equal now. \ud83d\ude44\n\n(I agree probably NA)", "It may be something like 14 small courses, each carefully prepared using super-pricy ingredients, with lots of personal attention from multiple staffers, delivering the course, explaining the food, etc.\n\nIt's not the kind of dinner you'd have every week, but maybe once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nKinda like paying for Super Bowl tickets -- you could see a lot of NFL games, and maybe a lifetime of college games for the price, but if you're really, really into it, it may be worth it.", "Had to get the reservation first. Not something I had time to discuss first.\n\nIn retrospect, I could have had this conversation before ever making it, but if her answer was no I'd still book a table", "It sounds like OP is pretty frugal and this is a wild splurge for him.  The girlfriend is a teacher and they earn similar wages.  (All in the comments, but I admit that tracking down all the comments is annoying if you're not really excited about a particular post.)", "Ha well if we wanna get closer we have to do our part and drop the double standards of expecting equal pay at work, whilst also expecting men to pay outside of it.", "It\u2019s a lot easier to get 1/2 of a Michelin star every four months than it is to get all three at once.", "Well, you say it\u2019s unnecessary, but everything you listed lasts a LOT longer than a dinner (clothes, hair appointments, etc). If she\u2019s a professional, it\u2019s an investment in her career whereas a meal is just that, a meal. It might be a really good meal, but if we\u2019re talking about unnecessary, it\u2019s significantly more unnecessary than buying something with any lasting purchase.\n\nI\u2019m not judging your choices by the way, but unnecessary is relative and I don\u2019t see how you can argue a dinner is less unnecessary than buying an item you use all the time and will last awhile.", "I'm not arguing that this meal is necessary. I'm just saying she has room to re-allocate funds and this would not cause her to starve or lose money for necessities.", "You think this guy is going to the restaurant unwashed, unshaven, and in a track suit?", "If she can go away for a weekend at an all-inclusive resort or drop $300 at a salon (all in the comments, and it's not fair to expect folks to track them all down, I'm not blaming you), then she can afford a $500 dinner with two month's notice.\n\nIt's too bad that she isn't willing to, especially since OP has made it clear how important this is to them.  I'm surprised that OP isn't saltier about it.", "I didn't see the comment where he said that, but I did see that his gf will spend $300 at a salon, and that's definitely not once in a lifetime.", "Totally NTA; you're not awful. This reminds me of when my husband and I were dating. He got 4 hard to get tickets to see his favorite band that were just wildly expensive. I don't hate the band but I'm pretty indifferent to them so it wasn't worth it to me to go and have to scrimp elsewhere to afford the ticket. So he and 3 friends, also huge fans, went and they made a night of it with a fancy dinner first etc. My response was 'have an amazing time!' It's not just that my then boyfriend was under no obligation to buy me a ticket but the fact of being with his friends who appreciate the band and really got into the concert was part of the experience that made for a great night. They didn't need me around who would have been like, 'meh, they're ok.' It was in no way inconsiderate.\n\nNow that we're a bit older and have a lot more disposable income, we like going to restaurants like the OP is describing. We often go with other friends who are also foodies because part of the fun of such meals is collectively appreciating and discussing the magic and alchemy the chef conjures. The girlfriend doesn't seem to want to so because of this but because of FOMO. She doesn't sound like she'd be a fun dining companion and would take away from the quality of the OP's overall experience.", "INFO: If you had waited for her to build up the money would she have paid for herself to go?", "I think NAH\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to pay, because that\u2019s a lot of money to drop on someone who isn\u2019t going to appreciate the experience for what it is. And like you\u2019ve said, you\u2019ve taken her out a lot of times and footed the bill at expensive restaurants. \n\nI understand why she\u2019s hurt, you\u2019ve been together two years and this is something you\u2019ve wanted to do (rightfully so) and instead of offering to pay (again not saying you should) or acting disappointed when she declined, you quickly replaced her, yes with a male friend (because if it was a woman, oh boy, you would be the asshole) to go with another couple.. aka a double date. That being said, she can communicate this to you a little better.  (I\u2019m also going to say $300 at the hair salon is normal for a woman) \n\nI don\u2019t think this is the hill to die on after two years together.", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to miss out on something you want because she can\u2019t afford it and it\u2019s selfish of her to want you too. Enjoy yourself.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is just sulking in the hope that it will convince you to pay for her.", "She\u2019s acting like that because she wanted you to pay. She wanted you to offer to do it and because you didn\u2019t and you won\u2019t justifiably she\u2019s acting all butt hurt.", "NTA", "So go without inviting next time?", "So like if you asked your friends if they wanna take a trip to New York, you would assume that you'd be paying for everyone? I'm asking as a genuine question, because if anyone in my friend groups were to ask any of us somewhere, we'd all assume we were paying our own way until we were told otherwise.", "Is not inviting her better?", "1. Agreed\n2. So why is up to me?\n3. Impossible to time it like that given the reservation system\n4. She has a couple months and could pay now save later. I did not think $500 required so much planning since it doesn't for me.", "What from the original post makes OP the AH? Genuinely curious", "Honestly, didn't really have the flexibility to give her this option with the way things worked. Moving forward, I will keep that in mind, but the reservation was made before this conversation/invitation happened. I had casually mentioned wanting to go without talking about the price or expectations. Did not think spending $500 or not going would be such a big deal.", "I don't see it as the ultimate in date night. Date night is for us to enjoy each other's company. This is the ultimate dining experience, for us to enjoy what the restaurant has to offer. But that may be a distinction worth clarifying to her.\n\nIm obviously not planning on gushing about it to her afterwards, so your prediction is wrong. I'm not one to talk about these things much in general. These experiences are for me, not something I show off.", "Oh ok. Yeah, that sounds like a whole different experience than just dinner. Definitely not something for me. But if this were my BF I'd just say: \"You go enjoy babe. I'll be here eating pizza\"", "I have a question, if she does choose to save up for this, are you going to uninvite your friend? Because that puts her in the position of looking like the bad guy to your friend now..", "Also, you say two months from now\u2026 is it Valentine\u2019s Day? Or anywhere within that time?!", "If you only read the original post, it seems that he is not taking her because he has money and she doesn\u2019t.  If you read the follow up comments, she has money but chooses to spend it elsewhere.", "Yeah... We'll see how that discussion goes \ud83e\udd23", "I acknowledge that there's a little of this going on, but I'm always a bit frustrated by this \"I pay money to look nice for you\" claim.  Does the partner get credit for paying hundreds of dollars a month for a nice car \"for you\" in the same way?\n\n(My partner doesn't spend a lot of her appearance, and neither do I.  If folks want to spend money on that, fine, but sometimes it seems like they want credit for \"making the world a more beautiful place,\" rather than just spending money on something they like.)", "Probably not - she didn't even consider doing that and I'm not going to risk losing out on deposit cause she might change her mind", "It's not valentines day, it's closer to March. And it's a table for 4 anyway.", "There are fewer than 150 Michelin 3 star (highest rating) restaurants in the world. Five are in NYC. The New York Times has a 4 star scale and there are three in New York with the highest rating. These are a tiny minority of culinary perfection and are priced accordingly. 4 diamonds out of 5 in the AAA rating system are much less exclusive.", "Not to exist, no, but if you work in many professions you are treated better and more likely to get promotions, etc. like because our society is trash, these things are true, but I\u2019m not naive that they are very true, you know?", "That isn\u2019t what I am saying at all - it isn\u2019t about the nice \u201cfor the partner\u201d - most women who work are viewed differently if they are unkempt, it costs a LOT more to maintain what is \u201cbasic professional\u201d for a woman than a man, in terms of clothing hair and makeup. It has nothing to do with the relationship and everything to do with society\u2019s expectations. Women have more social capitol in the office when they are perceived a certain way and that always costs them more money to be perceived that way than it does a man\u2026. And most men do not understand that cost is not really \u201coptional\u201d for many things, often viewing it as vain or splurging, etc. when often times it is literally part of what they have to do to be either treated better or achieve more success.", "That\u2019s fair, at this point I still think it\u2019s NAH but you may be in a no win situation regarding your girlfriend because she will be upset either way! \nEnjoy the restaurant though!", "Gotcha!", "Like I said, I guess it depends on the profession/area. I've never worn make up to work, neither has my mother or at least one of my aunts and that covers a variety of professions. We have/had to dress professionally, but that doesn't mean it needs to be brand new, expensive clothing. I know a lot of people personally feel they have to wear make up, but not as a job requirement. I've personally never understood it but it's that's what makes them comfortable go for it", "Yes, you are right about having to pay more to look professional, and I think that's wrong.  I'm in a field (software development) where women are treated terribly, and I try to do my best to help fix that.\n\nThat said, I know a lot of teachers, and I don't think most of them are spending $300 on salon visits, like OP's partner.  (That was down in the comments, and I freely acknowledge that it's not fair to expect everybody to track down all of the details.)", "I acknowledge that there's a pink tax, and that sucks, but when my partner and I go out for a $200 a plate dinner (haven't yet done a $500 a plate dinner), we're both washed, but she's not wearing any makeup and her outfit is likely no more expensive than mine.\n\nAre we doing something wrong?", "OP took her to a $300 per plate restaurant on Valentine's Day, so she probably had an idea that OP was lining up a pricey meal.\n\n(I gotta say, those rushed prix fixe meals on Valentine's Day \\*do\\* feel like a waste.)", "It\u2019s not about being comfortable, it\u2019s about being treated better when you \u201cfit\u201d what they want. None of this is good, btw, I hate all of it, but it\u2019s just true that people treat you better when you look a certain way bc our society is garbage.", "$300 for a salon visit is how much it costs me to get my hair done and dyed in a city at a chain salon, just so you know, like again, $300 (which would include the tip) at a salon seems insane to most men, a fancy man\u2019s haircut with a barber and like the straight razor and all that shit would be $125 with all the fixings. When I get my hair done it starts at $100 at the base cost, so like again, this is just an ignorance of costs for women, I think, unless they\u2019re in a super low cost of living area but if they have a Michelin restaurant that\u2019s highly unlikely, again, $300 for salon visit? Is not that unusual or extravagant.", "I believe that is your experience, I'm just telling you it's not mine. I have literally had people tell me they aren't comfortable leaving the house without make up on. Same with bras. Whereas most days I can't be bothered, I'd rather get extra sleep. And I've never been treated better at events where I've chosen to wear make up than ones I haven't. I'm sure it happens in some industries but not ones in familiar with.", "Wow.\n\nDo the other women at work pay similar amounts?  Does everybody feel like they need coloring/highlights to look professional?\n\nThis is an eye-opener for me -- as I said, I work in a field without a lot of emphasis on appearance, and I have minimal customer contact.  And my partner the academic is similarly low-key.   When I lived in the SF Bay Area, I typically spent $25 on a haircut.  Admittedly, it's been a long time since I had long hair and spent more and had to deal with lots of product.", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s most but certainly many. It\u2019s a major US city in a public facing industry. I also work with women ranging from ages 20-80 and for most, spending average of around $1200-$1500 annually for salon visits on a 6-8 week basis for upkeep. With that range of ages, grey hair - but yeah, again, women visibly aging is bad for their social capitol bc society is trash, so for many it\u2019s literally an investment in their future earnings/treatment at work and I hate it. There are also months where I\u2019ll box dye my hair from a CVS or whatever in a pinch, so like of course there are cheaper options but it always always LOOKS cheaper and damages your hair more, too.", "Bummer.  It's days like this that make me wonder if we all deserve to get hit with an asteroid."]}
