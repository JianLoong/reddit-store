I assume she knew you were saving up for this, yeah? You say in comments that your GF spends a lot of money on clothes and other frivolities, which is fine, her right and her prerogative. But you saved your money so you could go to this restaurant. That\u2019s your right and your prerogative. If she wanted to accompany you, then she should have set aside some of her funds so she could attend. She did not, so if she can\u2019t afford to now go, that was her choice.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should be obligated to pay for her, or to postpone your plans when she presumably had ample time to save like you did but chose not to. Would her plan be to start saving now? How long would that take? And would she stick to the commitment of saving? It\u2019s inconsiderate of her to expect you to cancel your plans just because she chose not to attend. You\u2019re allowed to have a fun time without your partner, especially when you saved up for it and she had the opportunity to do the same but chose not to.", "NTA. If she wont tell you WHY it is inconsiderate than she probably doesn't know either. If she just isn't willing to spend the money, than that is on her. You're free to spend your own money how you like.", "NTA. She\u2019s wanting you to pay.", "NTA - she's unreasonably entitled if she thinks you're obligated to pay for her.  Must you buy her a car if you get one?  Her a gown if you buy a suit?", "Not the asshole. She shouldn't expect you to pay for her and if it's something you enjoy doing she shouldn't stop you. I don't think you should feel bad, you deserve to enjoy yourself", "Nta. This is an experience that to you is worth 500. Clearly it isn\u2019t to her, or she would have said yes. She has no right to be mad.", "NTA. It\u2019s healthy to do things apart from your partner. Particularly if you\u2019ve been together for awhile. If this is a restaurant you wanted to try, you should be able to go. You offered her a spot in the reservation, she declined, end of story. You\u2019re not married yet and certainly do not need to pay $1000 for both of you. If she wanted to go, she could make the effort to save up for the night. \n\nYour girl is handling this pretty immaturely and selfishly.

That sort of dining isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, regardless of who pays for it.\n\nShe\u2019s being passive aggressive.  She can flat out say she can\u2019t afford it, leaving it up to you to counter with offering to pay.  Or not.  Nothing says you are required to pay for her meal.  But where is this culinary Mecca?  Cuz I would be down for that and could pay my own way.", "NTA. It\u2019s likely that she\u2019s feeling a little hurt that you\u2019d rather spend more on an experience for yourself without her than split the cost on a less-expensive meal with her, combined with some normal jealousy and FOMO. I\u2019d suggest doing a special movie night at home or something interesting along those lines as well so she feels like she\u2019s getting enough quality time with you. Or if you can spring for a theater ticket, The Menu would be the perfect date-night movie.", "NTA you asked her to go, she said no. You still want to go and try and it you\u2019re going with friends. Don\u2019t really see the issue here.", "NTA\n\nJust because you\u2019re in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend every waking hour together or experience everything together.

It\u2019s okay to have different interests. Go have a great time. \n\nFrom the post and comments this is something that you\u2019ve wanted to do for awhile. You check this specific restaurant regularly and something came up. She has 2 months to save if she wanted to be a part of this experience with you. She could afford it if she wanted to. This really reads that she\u2019s upset that you won\u2019t foot the bill. There\u2019s time to save but she would rather spend elsewhere but still have this experience with you as long as you pay. \n\nYou say she goes out with friends, are you always invited? Do you always attend? Or does do things independently without you? This is no different for you. You sacrifice to have this experience because you want the experience. She won\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You\u2019re not inconsiderate and you\u2019re doing nothing wrong.

And this FOMO was caused by you so understandably she's going to have those negative feelings directed towards you. It'd be great if she was able to communicate better how she's feeling to you but she also doesn't owe you an explanation every time she has a feeling, do you know how exhausting that is on top of when you already feel shitty? Not to mention it isn't always something you can pinpoint to a specific logical root cause even for the person feeling it. Or maybe she doesn't want to have to say out loud the reason because bring upset you aren't going to go to a special event for a reason you can control isn't something everyone wants to admit to. Does it matter why though? Unless you have a suggestion to change the situation I imagine if she were to tell you why, you'd try to argue on why she's unjustified in feeling that way.

At first I thought what a dick!  If you want to go to a nice place and your girlfriend can't afford it then you should foot the bill and share the experience. I confess I also thought $500 for dinner for one person? Holy crap! Then I remember my husband telling me a story of having a fancy meal in a restaurant like that back the 70's and if he is still talking about it I'm sure it was worth every cent for the memory. I think that the only thing you did that she may consider wrong is book the table before talking it over with her first.

But, if the OP all of a sudden decided to invite and pay for her, then she could feel like it was just his idea to treat her.\n\nI would indeed generalize it as it is good relationship behavior to both directly explain what one wants, and to directly explain why one is upset if that happens.

You did that.  She isn't prepared to. Therefore she doesn't need to go.\n\n\nWe all of things we love and spend our money on. It's important to plan and save properly. If I had to guess to wants you to foot the bill.\n\n\n\nNta. Go and enjoy yourself.", "It's not even about being considerate I think. I think it's that normally people want to have their partner be a part of cool rare experiences and you seem completely fine with replacing her with some dude.", "Because you\u2018re excluding her without offering a compromise, and even replaced her (you could\u2018ve at least not invited someone else then). \n\nShe can\u2018t afford it without financial repercussions, as it seems.", "I'll say you are NTA. And while some people are accusing you of being bad at communicating, her \"you should know why it's inconsiderate, but I won't tell you why\" is not a great sign of a good communicator.\n\nBut I'll take a guess at the \"you should know why\".  That guess is to her, super expensive dinners are indicative of a date. Like for Valentine's day, you took her on a super expensive date. \n\nSo from her perspective, you asked her to go on an expensive date (or a couples date), she said she couldn't afford it. Instead of either cancelling or offering to pay, you basically just said, fine, I'll have a bro date.\n\nNobody's an AH here, just two people needing to be better at communicating to figure out the other's POV.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. It does sound like you two prioritize experiences and finances differently, and that's normal, in my opinion. I would say go, but I would also say you guys work on some communication skills together. It seems pretty clear she wants to go, but doesn't want to pay, so she wants you to pay, or at least offer, or even offer to compromise in some way like paying part her way or whatever you might come up with.     Either way, the issue is the communication breakdown, which seems to be happening on her part in this situation. Building communication skills early will help yall navigate these types of difficult waters. Maybe you could break the ice on this conversation by suggesting the two of you save together to eat at an equally extravagant place as a romantic and important date.", "Ok. You're definitely NTA.\n\nBeing upset at being replaced, I can sort of see, just a little. But not much. Especially since its a guy friend thats replacing her.\n\nIf she's upset that you're going, that's all on her.\n\nI know some have suggested that its a communication failure and you should have talked before you reserved. I don't buy that really. This was an \"act now or lose the chance for who knows how long\" scenario. You didn't have time to talk to her first.\n\nAnd if you had talked to her prior, it doesn't sound like she'd have been interested anyway.\n\nFrom your comments on her spending habits, it sounds like the only way she'd have approved it in advance is if you'd agreed to pay her way. Which seems perhaps a tad unreasonable, maybe.\n\nYou are not choosing to exclude her. She's choosing to exclude herself by not prioritizing the experience enough to make the temporary lifestyle changes needed.\n\nWhich is fine. But she shouldn't be upset with you for the consequence of her own choice.\n\nHere's a question to consider asking here: Why does she value this matter enough to be hurt by you choosing to still go and inviting someone else in her steed, but not value it enough to make the effort to be able to go with you?\n\nThere is a gap there. If you can get to the heart of that, you may have the answer you really need.", "My partner would think it\u2019s a waste of money and probably be annoyed at how long it took, the food was too fancy and would probably walk away hungry. \n\nSooooooooo it\u2019s not his thing. \n\nBut shouldn\u2019t mean I can go!\n\nWould also take him if he enjoyed it. \n\nBut he would have to want to spend $500 on it", "Might have responded to the wrong comment haha", "She goes out for lunch every day! I bet that'd be an easy $3-400 right there. I think she buys coffee most days too. I eat at least twice as much as her and my lunch is about $2/day. Obviously it's kind of a big lifestyle change, but its a lifestyle I live every day to be able to afford these things.", "Sorry, answered in another comment. It's a guy. But we are going with another couple so maybe that's part of it. Truthfully, it's pretty hard to find *anyone* to spend this kind of money...", "Well she said she can't afford it. My opinion is actually that she can - if she sacrifices some unnecessary expenditures. But it's not reasonable for me to tell her how to spend her money.", "Sure, I already pay for more in the relationship. I have to draw the line somewhere, though. And I think a $500 dinner is pretty reasonable...", "She's not into food like I am. Even $100 on a meal feels excessive to her. But a $300 salon visit... Perfectly normal", "Boyfriend/girlfriend. I don't know who's paying", "That's irrelevant.  That's their relationship. \n\n\nIt's none of OP business what they do.\n\n\nBottomline is it's not important enough for his girlfriend to save for the experience.", ">experience that is important to you/you've been eager to make for a longer time.\n\nI think that's the important distinction. It's important enough to me that I'm willing to spend the money that could be used for other things. It's not important enough to her to spend her own money but important enough to give me a hard time for going.", "It\u2019s this right here. And it\u2019s def NAH, but she views it as something important to you so she would hope you\u2019d want to share that with her. Maybe take her out for something else special (but less expensive) the same week or something!", "Nah if you save for a dream experience that costs $500 that doesn't make you wealthy", "Sure, I'm not struggling. But, most days, no one would think I'm wealthy", "But in this case, he had wanted to include her. She is either unable or unwilling to pay what is required to participate. And he isn\u2019t able (or willing) to cover the cost for both - reasonable since it\u2019s quite expensive. \n\nShould he deny himself the chance at a cool rare experience that he really wants to do because his gf can\u2019t afford to join and he can\u2019t afford to cover her?", "But she knew he\u2019d been saving for awhile to go. She had the opportunity to save as well but chose not to. Clearly he *did* want her to go since he made the reservation with her in mind. But she didn\u2019t want to drop the $500 or save for it beforehand like he had. Which is her choice and that\u2019s fine. But it sounds more like she didn\u2019t want to be apart of this experience, and would prefer that OP give up his want for this experience to appease her rather than spend his money the way he\u2019d planned.", "There's a deposit involved, I can't reduce the party size for free. I probably should have asked before making the reservation, but I didn't want to lose the opportunity.", "But the reservation was for 4. I\u2019m not really sure how reservations work, is there a fee for canceling one? /gen", "He didn't exclude her. He asked her to come. She said no. What's the compromise? That he doesn't go because she can't afford to when he's been looking forward to the experience for a while. That doesn't seem fair to him at all and could even grow resentment because of it, nor is that a compromise. The reservation was for 4 people and he asked a guy friend to come with him (because yes it would have been inconsiderate to bring a female). Just because two people are dating doesn't mean that they can't enjoy or do things individually, and he did ask if she wanted to go before he went by himself.", "put a note that I edited the INFO comment based upon your reply. I had originally asked how long you had been together.", "Ok. Clearly you have different approaches to money. That doesn't answer my questions though.\n\nHow serious is this relationship? Who pays for fancy dates when you go out?", "Ok, phew, still NAH then!", "Oh that was more like how you view yourself being frugal and her splurging - a lot of the stuff you might view as splurging is also stuff like that, I would reckon. Just another perspective. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for not paying for her either btw.", "I wouldn't spend $500 on a meal. I'd easily spend $800 on a tattoo. People have different priorities. The look from having her hair done lasts weeks or months. The meal lasts a couple hours. I see why you'd drop money at the salon but not on food. \n\nPersonally I think you're NTA. She was offered a spot, she declined, you're going to the experience anyway. If she won't explain why she feels it's inconsiderate, I'm not sure how you're supposed to know.", "And that\u2019s okay! You guys can and should have different interests, but for her to be mad that you\u2019re enjoying YOUR interest without her isn\u2019t cool. My bf LOVES skiing, me not so much. If he got tickets to go to an amazing exclusive ski mountain I would much rather he bring another friend that\u2019s excited about it too, I would never even think of suggesting he not go or call him inconsiderate for going after I said I didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s probably a good idea to talk her about how her attitude about this makes you feel, she\u2019s probably too focused on how she\u2019s feeling rn and maybe hasn\u2019t considered your feelings.", "Is she friends with them?  Do you guys do other couples stuff together with them?\n\nIs there a bigger picture issue here in this relationship that she wants to be engaged/married and treated as your wife/equal?", "Did you say anything on the line of \"I'd love for you to be there too. It'd make the experience even more noteworthy\" blahblah. I feel like it'd help. \"as you know I've been wanting to go to blablah and I'd really love for you to come with me because [love, great time, amazing food, atmosphere, romantic, haven't done something like this together in a while etc]\"?", "He has highly implied that these dinners aren't \"one in a lifetime\" things tho.", "Oh I don't have a solution. I think they should just have an actual conversation about it, including her explaining what it is that bothers her. I voted for no a h being present", "That\u2018s sad :/ Again, try to have an open communication. :)", "You should\u2019ve offered to pay for part of the expense, like $250 \nIf you have enough to spend $500 on your self you should have some to help her enjoy things with you", "There is a deposit, so it would cost money to change", "I don\u2019t know how it works where you live. You could just talk to her once more, and the situation will probably settle either way.", "Well, I think all the updates OP gave should\u2018ve been given beforehand to make proper judgement possible.", "I'd say it's pretty serious or else I wouldn't even be conflicted right now. We both pay for dates, but I've paid for the most expensive ones. She's told me I've taken her to the fanciest restaurants she's ever been to.", "I don't think she should be as frugal as me, but I do think there is plenty of room to save $500 in a couple months", "Theyre my old friends, but we've all done stuff together a lot.\n\n>Is there a bigger picture issue here in this relationship that she wants to be engaged/married and treated as your wife/equal?\n\nPossibly? Is that a can of worms I want to open in response to this?", "Maybe not as eloquently as you but I did express disappointment at her not going", "You can save multiple times in your life. Doesn't mean he has to pay for his girlfriend if they aren't sharing finances.", "I mean, this is once in a lifetime. I won't go to this restaurant ever again. Well, unless my financial situation drastically improves.", "Agreed. They need to talk. \n\nAnd to be fair I think OP has tried but his gf has defaulted to \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have to explain why it\u2019s inconsiderate\u2019 which in my mind leans her a little bit into TA territory - for lack of communication.", "I talked to her almost immediately after making the reservation. I check the website for that restaurant frequently and something popped up, I couldn't really plan for it. She knew I wanted to go at *some* point", "That might be worth a try! Things are kinda awkward right now though", "Then it only made sense to fill her spot!", "This subreddit is all about cans of worms tho", "Is it possible she has anything coming up that she has to spend lots of money on? Medical expenses, car broken, Christmas gifts?", "I mean if you just want to ignore stuff that OP himself said go ahead, in other comment he stated he paid for a 300$ dinner earlier this year.\n\nBut yeah, keep trying to convice everyone that those expenses are something that everyone can afford, sure \ud83d\ude02", "That's not what my comment means and you perfectly know it c'mon don't act crazy now.", "I guess Christmas, but that's an expense I have too. Nothing else to my knowledge.", "I eat costco chicken every day and cook 95% of my meals. I only buy food on sale. I probably save $300 in a month on food compared to most people just from that."]}
