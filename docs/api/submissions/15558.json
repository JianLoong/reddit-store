I didn't read it as you not wanting to take/spend time with your kids. I read it as you wanting to be respected, and given more of a heads up about when and why you'll be needed. It seems as if your ex doesn't care to actually try to work things out with you ahead of time. Obvs she wouldn't be able to plan being sick. I get that. But looking for a house? I'm sure that was planned. Ahead of time. More than just the day of. Couldn't she have had the decency to ask you *before* she made the plans, saying she needed to do this at this time? And could you please take the kids so I can find a comfortable living space for them? Seems like a fairly reasonable request...\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this OP. This seems like more of a respect issue than a custody issue. It's not that you don't want to be with your kids, and help with their care and support. You need to set boundaries for yourself, while making sure your kids are taken care of, especially as someone who has dealt with depression. From what I read, that's what you're trying to do. And that's a good thing.\n\nI'd say you're NTA. Good luck, OP!", "NAH.", "NTA \n\nIt is 100% fine for you to draw a boundary and choose not to take the kids on any day that is not part of your custody schedule. (For those who haven\u2019t read the comments, OP frequently does this and rarely says no) However, it is interesting that you chose this particular instance to refuse \u2014 rather than some of the other, more frivolous times she has made this request \u2014 and it makes me think you are harboring some resentment. The title also supports that conclusion IMO. \n\nBased on how frequently you take the kids and the way it\u2019s impacting your finances, I think you should consider asking for a revision to the custody schedule. I don\u2019t know if that will help with the resentment you seem to be feeling, but it sounds like you are well enough to care for the kids at least 50% of the time and you shouldn\u2019t be paying child support if you are already doing so.", "NTA - she can ask but she should expect no as a possibility. It doesn't really matter what she has to do or how much time who has with the children it comes down to the agreement and advance knowledge, an arrangement she asked for let alone agreed to. Of course it can be renegotiated by both of you, fact is it should be if it's a regular thing", "NTA. Custodial time was established in the divorce decree. The ex agreed to it. \n\nOP is allowed to say no and isn't required to give a reason, and not feel bad for it. \n\nNow is as good as time as any to establish boundaries. Sounds to me like the ex frequently takes advantage of OP and his willingness to help. He just isn't articulating the point well.\n\nShe's using him for free babysitting.

And maybe try for a 50/50 custody arrangement.", "I mean he was pretty clear that it\u2019s not based on the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to have his kids but that he only gets financial assistance based on the custody agreement and literally can\u2019t afford all the extra time they\u2019re with him. If the ex wants the custody agreement to be different she needs to allow that to go on paper so that he can afford to keep them.", "God forbid you actually consider the fact that financial support is based in the system on how much each parent has the kids, so the primary parent is financially cheating by getting the financial support based on X% but actually having them less.", "Cool story. If that is the case, why does OP have to pay ANY child support?", "Also if they have a good house the kids will benefit too? Or am I just too simple?", "I'm disabled. Its his laziness is the problem. He doesn't even take care of his kids", "You feel taken advantage of for caring for your own children less than full time????", "You're very clearly jealous. And I doubt it's really close to 50/50 as you say.", "Get a better custody agreement legally thru the courts. Document every time you have them beyond they custody agreement. It may change any child support payments. \nNever say no to spending time with your kids. Why aren\u2019t you already going to their practices and supporting them?", "If you have a problem with this you need to get a new custody agreement.", "Only here to say that most open houses take place on the weekends, and you don\u2019t really have a say when you can go look. If you\u2019re being proactive in buying a house, attending open houses is the best way to get an offer in early. So, she most likely didn\u2019t have the opportunity to schedule it", "Ok, then renegotiate the custody order.", "The OP has them more than 50% in reality, just not on paper.", "Yep. That's the problem, she's messing with his income by having the paperwork say one thing when the reality is something else.\n\nShe's gaming the system", "Then OP needs to document and go back to court, not complain on Reddit.", "Oh they are not gonna like that. That would mean she has to be accountable", "Yes depression so bad that you find yourself being paid by the government is totally not legitimate. Just plain old laziness.\n\nPeople wonder why so few people want to get their mental health treated then stuff like this is said out loud and the stigma is refreshed. It's not a real illness it's just \"laziness\". \n\nBtw The OPs post history implies they are/were seeing a neurologist for something not mentioned here.", "You have no idea in what way the OP is disabled, no idea of their circumstances beyond what they have written- so how about you stop jumping to the worst conclusions based on your own anecdotes, moron.", "You mean all the stuff she should be able to ask their actual father for help with??? Grow up. Yta\nEdit spelling", "I doubt very much he pays any kind of child support. He doesn\u2019t work. If in the USA he doesn\u2019t have to pay anything out of his disability for child support. Dude is just pissy that the primary caregiver occasionally asks him to cover when needed. And doubtful he has them 8 days, kids are in school. So even when he gets them an additional day it\u2019s likely a couple hours after school them mom gets them and does evening routine", "He's unemployed, they're not gonna give him more time", "Not everyone is from the US \ud83d\ude0a OP states it's about x in dollars.", "Well yes, of course, but as of right now that's not their custody order. I totally understand that shit happens and parents have to come together to do what's best for the kids but it's not cool when one parent takes advantage of that. As you said, they need to renegotiate the custody order, but until that happens it sounds like OP's ex is trying to have her cake and eat it too.", "And yet he's whining about taking care of his kids. Acting like its some burden put upon him", "Don't need to jump to conclusions. He's complaining in black and white right here about having to take his kids.\n\nHave you been reading his comments? He doesn't even WANT them.", "As i read it op is from Sweden, in Sweden the parent where the kids live get childsupport even if the other parent cant pay. Its payed from a government agency and is funded by our social network aka taxes. So she gets money every month even if she doesnt have the child at home.", "It sounds like you guys need to go back and change the custody agreement to better suit your new arrangement.", ">OP's ex is trying to have her cake and eat it too.\n\nIf the ex is buying a house, and presumably the kids are going to be living in that house most of the time. So this specific situation sounds like one where the kids ultimately benefit, which is something OP should care about, no?", "even when the child isn\u2019t at her home she\u2019s still paying for long term-expenses and things like clothes and after school extras. you can\u2019t just stop spending money on your kid just because they\u2019re not physically there. OP contributes very little financially."]}
