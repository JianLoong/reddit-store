I didn't read it as you not wanting to take/spend time with your kids. I read it as you wanting to be respected, and given more of a heads up about when and why you'll be needed. It seems as if your ex doesn't care to actually try to work things out with you ahead of time. Obvs she wouldn't be able to plan being sick. I get that. But looking for a house? I'm sure that was planned. Ahead of time. More than just the day of. Couldn't she have had the decency to ask you *before* she made the plans, saying she needed to do this at this time? And could you please take the kids so I can find a comfortable living space for them? Seems like a fairly reasonable request...\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this OP. This seems like more of a respect issue than a custody issue. It's not that you don't want to be with your kids, and help with their care and support. You need to set boundaries for yourself, while making sure your kids are taken care of, especially as someone who has dealt with depression. From what I read, that's what you're trying to do. And that's a good thing.\n\nI'd say you're NTA. Good luck, OP!", "NAH.", "NTA \n\nIt is 100% fine for you to draw a boundary and choose not to take the kids on any day that is not part of your custody schedule. (For those who haven\u2019t read the comments, OP frequently does this and rarely says no) However, it is interesting that you chose this particular instance to refuse \u2014 rather than some of the other, more frivolous times she has made this request \u2014 and it makes me think you are harboring some resentment. The title also supports that conclusion IMO. \n\nBased on how frequently you take the kids and the way it\u2019s impacting your finances, I think you should consider asking for a revision to the custody schedule. I don\u2019t know if that will help with the resentment you seem to be feeling, but it sounds like you are well enough to care for the kids at least 50% of the time and you shouldn\u2019t be paying child support if you are already doing so.", "NTA - she can ask but she should expect no as a possibility. It doesn't really matter what she has to do or how much time who has with the children it comes down to the agreement and advance knowledge, an arrangement she asked for let alone agreed to. Of course it can be renegotiated by both of you, fact is it should be if it's a regular thing", "NTA. Custodial time was established in the divorce decree. The ex agreed to it. \n\nOP is allowed to say no and isn't required to give a reason, and not feel bad for it. \n\nNow is as good as time as any to establish boundaries.

Not that this is okay, but this feels more involved than OP has led us to believe.\n\nIf this all came about because he was broke and couldn't get assistance to cover the full 50/50 childcare arrangement, I don't know that this reflects well on him given the $600+ he wants to spend on a PS5 when he's already got every other PS console, a backlog of games, and PlayStation Premium ($18/month).

Or are you gonna tell them no, you are not interested in anything less than they take care of you if they want to see you?  You need to get your depression under control and figure out how to be more present with your kids.  Depression sucks but they have therapy - medications, behavior modification and other types of treatment.  There is no reason you cannot be more active with the kids and share more of the burden of raising them.  You are after all one of the parents - which makes you 50% responsible for them.  I think she is being generous by helping you to understand you need treatment and can get funding while you seek treatment.  It is not her responsibility to care for them with no help from you while you hide behind depression.

At some point, \"supporting\" becomes \"enabling\" and I really think she's just sick of it.

She is downplaying his role in his kids life as a means to an end, instead of a relationship. So yes, she should hire someone when she DELIBERATELY scheduled a house tour to conflict with her kids' practice.

He has an old PS4, soon there won't be new games even on PS4. Regardless, the cost breakdown of about $8 a month for 4 years is accurate. I'm not saying he needs one now, but I can't blame someone for such a \"cheap\" monthly hobby cost over time. It seems to be more his legal agreement is very limited to how often he sees his kids as well, and if his ex is dumping kids on him randomly he has to cover food and other costs. If he budgeted himself for the time he was legally obligated to watch his kids then I could see it being a cost issue on a fixed income. \n\nI'm not saying I agree with him getting a PS5 right now, but in the grand scheme of cost over time, the PS5 is not keeping him from hanging out with his kids. It's probably the cost of feeding and entertaining his kids while he illegally is left with them. If he expected to have them 4 nights a month and now the ex is dropping them off more, that is causing him to need to reevaluate his budget on social security. What he should do is document all the times he has to watch them, and potentially social security will increase his benefits since the kids are with him more than originally stated. His income is partially based on the legally binding time frame he would have his kids.\n\nIt's not just black and white, I don't think he got a gaming system and now he can't afford his kids... I'm hoping he budgeted for it, but he probably didn't budget for extra days taking care of the kids. Plus for me, when I got my PS5, I traded in my PS4 to best buy for $200 and that covered about half the cost of the new console. If he did that, the 4 year cost is like $4-5 a month. He probably wasn't budgeting well, but most people don't.", "Oh no! The horror he has a PS4! /s", "Lol, it's not about that. It's just the fact that if he traded it in and got a new console. That's not a huge cost over years of usage. I'd rather the guy with depression, medical, and family issues have some sort of hobby and enjoyment. But regardless, like I did say prior. I'm not saying he should have got one, but I can understand why he did. If he did budget it out, I'm sure he would have been okay if the ex stuck to the legally binding custody schedule.\n\nI also feel like as a father, he could do more, but idk exactly what condition this guy is in.
