I didn't read it as you not wanting to take/spend time with your kids. I read it as you wanting to be respected, and given more of a heads up about when and why you'll be needed. It seems as if your ex doesn't care to actually try to work things out with you ahead of time. Obvs she wouldn't be able to plan being sick. I get that. But looking for a house? I'm sure that was planned. Ahead of time. More than just the day of. Couldn't she have had the decency to ask you *before* she made the plans, saying she needed to do this at this time? And could you please take the kids so I can find a comfortable living space for them? Seems like a fairly reasonable request...\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this OP. This seems like more of a respect issue than a custody issue. It's not that you don't want to be with your kids, and help with their care and support. You need to set boundaries for yourself, while making sure your kids are taken care of, especially as someone who has dealt with depression. From what I read, that's what you're trying to do. And that's a good thing.\n\nI'd say you're NTA. Good luck, OP!", "NAH.", "NTA \n\nIt is 100% fine for you to draw a boundary and choose not to take the kids on any day that is not part of your custody schedule. (For those who haven\u2019t read the comments, OP frequently does this and rarely says no) However, it is interesting that you chose this particular instance to refuse \u2014 rather than some of the other, more frivolous times she has made this request \u2014 and it makes me think you are harboring some resentment. The title also supports that conclusion IMO. \n\nBased on how frequently you take the kids and the way it\u2019s impacting your finances, I think you should consider asking for a revision to the custody schedule. I don\u2019t know if that will help with the resentment you seem to be feeling, but it sounds like you are well enough to care for the kids at least 50% of the time and you shouldn\u2019t be paying child support if you are already doing so.", "NTA - she can ask but she should expect no as a possibility. It doesn't really matter what she has to do or how much time who has with the children it comes down to the agreement and advance knowledge, an arrangement she asked for let alone agreed to. Of course it can be renegotiated by both of you, fact is it should be if it's a regular thing", "NTA. Custodial time was established in the divorce decree. The ex agreed to it. \n\nOP is allowed to say no and isn't required to give a reason, and not feel bad for it. \n\nNow is as good as time as any to establish boundaries. Sounds to me like the ex frequently takes advantage of OP and his willingness to help. He just isn't articulating the point well.\n\nShe's using him for free babysitting. She can pay a sitter if she needs to free up some time.", "INFO - What happens when you say \u2018no\u2019?", "They are **your kids**.\n\nYou aren\u2019t being \u201ctaken advantage of\u201d by spending time with and watching **your own kinds**.\n\nYTA.", "Yeah maybe I am.

I\u2019m supposed to have them 8 days/month but have them a lot more, even more than 50/50 some months. It\u2019s the way she asked me that makes me feel taken advantage of. I never say no to having them, they are my world and if it was up to me I would have them 110%.", "there are possibly custody-related reasons as to why he cant work tho", "Yeah I wasn\u2019t clear enough in the post, it\u2019s supposed to be 8 days (Friday to Monday) but I have them a lot more, sometimes even more that 50% witch is our original agreement.  I never say no to extra days and my oldest is here a lot because she doesn\u2019t like her mom. It\u2019s jus the difference in the way she asked me that gets me. She is sick one day and is so so sorry for bothering me (which she is not, I love having my kids) and the next day it\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m looking at a house, take the kids\u201d", "Thank you! That\u2019s what I feel to.

Don\u2019t defend him.", "Oh God forbid that the kids who share HALF your DNA spend almost HALF their time with you, their father. Grow tf up please. It\u2019s always the non primary parent trying to say they\u2019ve been taken advantage of.", "You have the opportunity to spend extra time with them. It shouldn't be looked at as a chore or as if you are doing her a favour.", "It is ABSOLUTELY that, wether or not you want to admit it to yourself. Apparently you love your extra days with them 99% of the time, but now that your ex is looking to take a big step in her relationship with this new guy, you suddenly have a problem with watching them for a couple hours. Keep telling yourself it's for logistic or financial reasons if you want, but deep down this is based in emotion. \n\nThat's just how the housing market works, places get snatched up quickly and sometimes you have to do tours at inconvenient times in order to get an offer in quickly.\n\nIf you want your custody agreement changed to reflect the current status quo, do that. But refusing to watch them for a couple hours if you've got nothing else going on is silly.", "How is having your children more than 8/30 days you being taken advantage of?

So what is the truth here ?", "So how much are you paying in child support?", "Is it the same days every week that she\u2019s asking for extra time if so then can you say that you want your custody amended so that you can just have more time with your kids since it\u2019s happening so often and you can just go to the social agency and adjust your paperwork to reflect the accurate number of days per month you have your kids. And if you communicate to your ex via text than u have proof that you have your kids on these extra days if the agency needs to see it", "When exactly on Friday do you have them ? \n\nWhen exactly on Monday do they go back to their mother's ?", "But it\u2019d be nice to help.", "Yeah, I phrased the post wrong. It\u2019s not that I have a problem with having my kids it\u2019s that she decided that I can only have them 8 days/month, asked me if I can have them extra all the time, I never say no, an this time she was so sorry for being sick and felt so guilty bla bla bla, and the very next day she asked me again because she\u2019s looking at a house.", "Wondering as well\u2026", "That's she decided she wants to care for 90% she could have scheduled it when kids where busy.

A lot of people have that in their structured custody arrangements where the ex-partner has to offer the other an option to take the kids instead of sending them to daycare.
