The issue with housing in America isn't people buying houses to live in.  It's people buying multiple houses and renting them out at very high rates.   As long as your children are living in the houses you've helped them buy, they're not negatively impacting the housing market.  In fact, you've reduced the demand for rentals.", "NTA... He's making it sound like you just bought a few houses to rent out to people. The houses are in your kids' names, and they qualified for the mortgage. There is nothing wrong with them owning their own homes in their early 20's. Does he have kids himself? Does he own his own home? Maybe this is more jealousy towards you doing something good for your kids.", "NTA\n\nUsing your brother's logic you have now freed up two rental places for people in need of rentals.\n\nI like this way of doing it, you've given them an assist but it is one they needed to work for as well as they needed to get the mortgage for the rest.", "Your brother\u2019s statement does not even make sense.\n\nNTA\n\nWhat a smart thing to do for your kids.", "NTA. You\u2019re helping your kids out in buying a home, not just gifting it for free. And they will want/ need a home one day! You said yourself that it\u2019s turning out to be cheaper for them to pay a mortgage every month than rent. Unless you paid over market cost by an absurd amount for the homes, you\u2019re not contributing to the rising cost of housing. You did a good thing, don\u2019t overthink it.", "NTA Your children are people and people need houses. He may be a tad jealous that he wasn't willing or able to do this himself.", "What you\u2019re doing is extremely generous to your children. The reason the housing market sucks is because America\u2019s economy really sucks. It has nothing to do with you or what you\u2019re doing if anything you\u2019re helping your kids escape the horrible trouble of finding a place to live in that most of us have to live in. I wish I had someone like you to do that for me instead, I have to rent at a terrible price.", "NTA your brother is just looking for a reason to complain. Your kids may have families one day to live in those houses.", "That's just stupid...is your brother usually such a dumbass ....nta", "NTA. Your money, do what you want. They will have to pay gift tax on that money though, which is anywhere from 18-40%.

Your brother's logic is flawed.  You're smart for helping your kids get ahead of the curve, and building equity early.  Your job is to help your kids, not worry about what your brother thinks, and you're doing a great job!", "He doesn't have a point. If you go to a supermarket and buy the last Texas toast, you have prevented someone else from buying it, but that's not wrong. First come, first serve. It's lovely that you did this for your kids.

It's easy to qualify and buy a home - it's a struggle to pay, maintain, and hold onto a home which is what you're going to be teaching them.  You can't do that if they're renting.  They also understand that they're not waiting on an inheritance when you and your wife pass away, which will serve them better in the here and now.  Just keep working with them on their responsibilities so they can keep learning and educate their own children.", "I\u2026what? He sounds like he has a very naive idea of how the world works. If your kids didn\u2019t buy those houses, does he think the only people who would have purchased them were families with kids who need housing? That your kids aren\u2019t in need of a family home right this second, so they have one right now and need to spend more money later when housing prices are even higher? No. That makes no sense. \n\nBy his own logic, they now have houses, so their apartments are now available for people who are in the market. \n\nNTA", "NTA, the cost of housing is going up because big corporations are buying up tons of homes.
