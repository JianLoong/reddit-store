If the concern is who will care for him if she dies, why doesn\u2019t her family who is giving you grief step up?\n\nBased on the dates you provided it appears the boy is around 13 years old. So it\u2019s only a few more years until he is an adult. Bluntly, it sounds like your ex\u2019s motivation is financial. This is your decision and your commitment, so follow your gut on this one.", "NTA She's looking for a check by you adopting him. She can't come after your earnings if you don't adopt which seems to be her sole motivation. I'm guessing her family expected you to shoulder the financial burden and that's why they're calling you names.", "NTA and I think this honestly sounds like a cash grab from your soon to be ex.", "Info - Was her son a part of these discussions and therefore was expecting the adoption to happen?", "Lots of things will change between you and your boy. You will have no rights to him if she decides that she doesn\u2019t want you in his life anymore. \n\nYour 50% mean literally nothing. At any point she can decide you don\u2019t get to see him. Unfortunately, paper matters in these circumstances if you want to guarantee your role in his life.", "Info: did the child know you were planning to adopt him?", "Im gonna say NTA , you can be a dad and take him in if something were to happen and still spend time with him 50/50  and have that agreement on a will if needed , but with adoption and divorce comes the possibility of child support. & although that would help her , she asked for a divorce and that\u2019s technically not your child. Although he will probably be confused and hurt you can always communicate and remind him you\u2019ll be there for him always if you plan on doing that.", "INFO\n\nWhere is the biological father of this boy, it this adoption related to keeping him away from him?  \n\nI'm trying to understand why the mother is pushing this so hard when it wasn't so important the 9 years you were married.", "I have mixed feelings on this.\n\nMy gut reaction was she wants to go heavy on the child support while alienating the child from you. \n\nBut in the opposite end, if you\u2019re willing to continue to support them as before why wouldn\u2019t you just make it legal.\n\nIn the end, the important part is how the child feels about this. That should dictate your actions.", "NTA, but it does create the potential for him to be taken away from you if something happens to his mom. It also means you don't have authority as a legal guardian when it comes to making decisions.", "The kid is 13. \n\nSo long as you are there for his mentally and physically and are allowed to do so, the kid can decide when he is an adult. You do not need to be legally liable for the child and that's a choice.", "Depending on the state. If you legally adopt a child from a previous marriage, and then get divorced. You have to pay child support on the kid you adopted. Yup, you are responsible for a child that is biologically not even yours. I feel like she's trying to trap you. If she wanted you to have custody or raise the child in an even of her death, she can just make a will", "YTA. Your stbx could just not let you see him. Legally you are nothing to each other after a divorce. And I can\u2019t imagine your son believing you love him as much as your daughter but don\u2019t want to be legally attached to him and possibly also not share your name with him. Yes, you might pay more child support but at least you could maintain some rights which you presently have none of. 13 year olds are smart enough to realize those realities or at least surrounded by other kids who will be quick to point them out.", "NTA. I feel like you have been pressured into this, and don't trust her motives for doing so.", "NTA. Sounds like she wants to totally screw you over with child support and just needs you to adopt him in order to do so.", "If you were already planning to and had a court date already, why would you not? It isn't a cash grab if this has been the plan for years.  Maybe she wants you to go through with it to show the kiddo that he's not losing you, no matter what. Maybe she wants to go through with it for the same reasons you previously discussed.  Maybe she wants to go through with it because it's what her son wants.", "INFO\n\nSounds to me like you're trying to get the financial out of to having to pay child support despite raising this kid from 4 - 13.\n\n>The only reason we were even going to do it was in case anything would happen to her, there wouldn't be a question to where he would go\n\nHas something about that changed?

It was devastating to learn he adopted me because my mother blackmailed him. Taking care of a child and loving them can be enough.

The most child support your ex could ding you for is 5 years. But that leaves you with roughly another 50 years of being connected to this young man. Of being his actual father. Is that Return on Investment not enough for you?\n\nEveryone out there saying \"he is not your son, it doesn't matter\", is discounting the connection you can have with an adopted child. But I know. My daughter was almost 4 when we adopted her and I guaran-damn-tee-ya that she was totally my daughter by the age of 13! There's nothing I wouldn't have done to keep my place in her life secure. No piece of paper or court procedure I wouldn't have signed. Nothing I wouldn't have done to assure her that I wasn't going anywhere!\n\nMaybe your connection with him isn't as strong as you think. Because you don't appear to want any real connection that HE can count on. After all, what will he call you after this? If he has an accident and goes to the hospital, you will have NO right to get information as to how he is doing. If he has trouble at school, you will have NO say. Is this the life, the place that you want?\n\nThink very hard about this. What will \"your child\" think of being told first that \"his dad\" will adopt him, and then being told that you no longer want to adopt him? What would YOU think if you were his age?\n\nI'm not going to offer a judgment, because if you truly don't have a deep connection with this kid, then you are N T A for skipping away from the adoption. If you truly DO feel like you are connected, then on behalf of the kid, I'd give you a Y T A judgment.", "NTA. \n\nYour ex is most likely only looking to use the adoption to obtain a higher divorce settlement award and child support from you until her son is 18 or 21.", "if you are not his legal parent, you do not have visitation rights to him. It's one of the biggest complaints step parents have and a huge reason why a lot of them stay in terrible marriages - they don't want to lose access to the children they have raised and love. This is a gift. Now, sure, maybe she has ulterior motives like requiring financial support. But this is the best way to make sure that your child feels loved and wanted (especially in the midst of a divorce and at a sensitive age) and that you never lose contact. No matter what it cost me financially, Id jump on this chance! You are very lucky!", "I agree NTA\nI believe ex's reasoning is financial also.", "Actually, he wouldn't be able to take him in if he has another guardian.", "The father has never been in his life. I love him, and he has been my son since we met.  My attorney said no judge would ever send him to his biological father. That was all I needed to hear.", "Sounds to me like they\u2019re trying to hook him financially even though the boy isn\u2019t his. He can still be the boys dad but not have to financially support him", "I don't trust my ex-wife now. He has been my son for 10 years without the paperwork, amd that has never been a problem for her, until now. It just seem like something is off.", "Exactly. The boy was even told he would be adopted and now suddenly that's not happening.", "Of course. She's going to apply for child support the moment those papers are signed.", "The child is around 13, if OP was willing to foster him and the child expressed a preference for OP there's a good chance OP would get him if anything happened to his mother.", "I believe in some states they can settle a custody agreement if they have written consent from both parents and if its all on legal paperwork", "Then what is the issue in adopting him if he's your \"son\"? As I see there might be red flags about the mother, what you're saying is that you'll have a relationship with him as long as it's no strings attached and no actual legal responsibility if anything should happen. If your situation changes and you get another family, then maybe you have an out as \"his dad\". You say he's your son, but he's not. He's someone you think you love \"like a son\", but you're not that because you choose not to be. And to a kid, that paper probably means a lot. Even if they were to say it doesn't. It's the decision to legally say, I'm here forever.\n\nI'm not trying to pick a fight. Alot of guys are pointing out he doesn't owe the kid any obligation as biologically he's not OP's. But that's ridiculous. He was married and chose to MAKE A FAMILY with this woman AND child. The child does not know any difference. And yay, OP will continue to \"see\" said child 50% of the time, for now. But this also gives him an out to \"get out\" at anytime if he so chooses. Personally I would rather OP not put pretenses on that's the child is \"his son\" and just state I'll continue the relationship with the child rather than just the label son, because he's not OP's son as he's clearly drawn the line. Can't have your cake and est it too in this circumstance of labels.", "NTA", "He raised this child as a parent for 9 years. He's partly responsible for all aspects of the kid's wellbeing at this point.", "The flip side is that as long as the marriage existed, you son had some legal protection and connection to you. You were a member of that household and legally bound to his mom. Once the divorce is final there's no legal structure connecting you and him. \n\nYou ex might be doing something sketchy. But there also a legit change in circumstances here.\n\nHave you talked with your son? Was he aware of the adoption plans?", "If I'm not mistaken, this child's biological family would have precedence over OP. And, if they wanted, OP would have no saying in his future.", "Not sure what you mean.\n\n1. He didn't do any paperwork.\n\n2. He is not the parent or legal guardian.", "No that\u2019s not true at all. As soon the divorce is over he doesn\u2019t owe the kid a cent or second of his time. Would that be a dick move? sure. can he do it anyways? Yes. I doubt he will be he definitely should not adopt", "We told him that I was going to adopt him a couple of months ago. We told him the only thing that would change is that there would be a piece of paper now. We are going to tell our children this weekend. I will have a long talk with him, explaining the situation. I will always be here for him, and I love him as much as my daughter. I just don't want my ex-wife to have leverage on me anymore.", "That would depend if biological dad and family are in the picture , if ex wife really wanted OP to take her son if something were to happen they can sign legal document saying step son would go to OP , but thats only if she still wants to do that considering she\u2019s upset OP doesnt want to legally adopt her son", "This is AITA. Not \"am I within the bounds of what is legal.\"", "So it sounds like you and your ex are always going to be connected by other children. \n\n>I will always be here for him, and I love him as much as my daughter.\n\nI hope that is the case. Realistically you are saying \"take my word on it, I'm not making a legal commitment to that effect.\" And I get that's about your desire to disconnect from you ex. But you should realize that tacit statement may mean something different to your son.", "I'm not saying OP has no chance of being involved in this kid's life. My point is that, by not doing the paperwork, OP is leaving it to chance. Whether he will or won't be able to be in this kid's life.", "You are correct in that , until there is Legal documentation on both of them agreeing what will happen to child in the future , everything is up in the air and theres no definite answer if he will or will not take him , let alone see him once the divorce is finalized"]}
