The insurance company giving them money for a place to live while theirs is repaired is contingent upon them paying for a place to live while theirs is repaired. If they aren't paying anything and telling the insurance company they are, that's insurance fraud. And they're trying to make you an accomplice.\n\nThis isn't just about avoiding increased utility bills and preventing damage (which are valid concerns in their own right).

Don't let them move in.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "NTA\n\n> But my parents and her in-laws are bugging me \n\nLooks like we found where they can stay if they don't want to sign your perfectly reasonable lease!", "NTA. Anybody that thinks you're being a greedy asshole is welcome to house them for free in their own homes.", "NTA.  If your sister and her husband need a place to stay and insurance is paying for it then they should cover their costs minimum.  You said you only want the money to go into an account that will cover any damage they do to your rental suite and other than that for them to pay their fair share of the utilities. That is more than fair.  If they want to be greedy they can stay elsewhere.", "NTA! If your parents and her in laws are both opposed to you charging them, one of them can take your sister and her husband in for free instead.", "Sounds like they need to use that insurance money to rent a place. NTA.", "NTA and feel free to send them to your parents and her in-laws house instead.  There's a reason they've \"worn out their welcome\" where they're staying now.", "NTA - definitely make them sign a lease agreement with a monthly rent due. They don\u2019t have the right to freeload off of you.", "NTA. We can see how they wore out their welcome at the last place they stayed. You definitely need a contract, and they need to pay. You are not their insurance or extra savings plan.", "NTA and their responses to your reasonable request make me think they would also wear out their welcome at your place too.\n\nWho's to say their house gets rebuilt and they don't go and sell it and still be \"homeless\" because they haven't found a new home? A build can take quite a while, it's not a fast process.  I'd stick to your gut of enforcing a lease and utilities.\n\nIf they don't like that they can go rent a place until their home is available since insurance is paying for them to stay somewhere. Or the people giving you crap for being logical can house them.", "At cost? Where's the greed? \n\nNTA. Get a contract, and protect your ass(ets).", "Nope, NTA. \n\nYes, you're family, but you shouldn't be expected to provide for them. They're adults. If they're having trouble finding a place to stay, then it's nice that you want to help them, but expecting you to pay for all their utilities is absurd.", "NTA\n\nThe people who think you are a greedy A H can move them into their home.", "NTA - they want to live with you for free and have you pay their expenses but **you're** the greedy one? Of course the family is pushing you to take them - if you don't, they will have to take them. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. Having a lease with house rules is a great way to protect yourself and them if issues arise. Taking two extra people will greatly increase your bills and they should be helping with their portion.", "Absolutely Nta, now it might be different if they weren\u2019t getting this money but they are. They aren\u2019t entitled to anything from you family or not and it\u2019s important you protect yourself in event that things go bad and there is damage. Far too often you see this happening in posts like this. You\u2019re doing the right thing if they don\u2019t like it let them pay the money for a place elsewhere, don\u2019t let them take advantage of your kindness", "NTA. The reason their insurance is paying them is FOR UTILITIES AND LIVING EXPENSES. Whether or not you're family, they should be paying some of that towards your added expenses while you're there. \n\nAnd an lease is just good business. It protects everyone, not just you.", "NTA. Looks like they\u2019re trying to rip off the insurance company. Stay out of that mess. If you family insist they should take them in.", "NTA\n\nIf it were me I'd decline having them stay due to them committing Ins Fraud. You could be held legally to blame as well.", "NTA. And do not be guilted into letting them live with you. I would tell the lot of them that you are only doing this because they are family, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to live in your extra space. You are not their parents, who can afford to cover the extra costs that will be incurred with additional people living in your home so unless one of the complainers wants to cough up some funds or let them move in, they should all butt out. Finally insurance is intended to put them back in the same place they were prior to the loss and not a better one, so unless they are willing to pay expenses like they would living in their own home, you may just need to make a phone call. Also it isn\u2019t like you are asking to profit from the situation but literally recover costs associated with them living their or potential damage. If there is no damage, well they get to keep the money.", "NTA\n\nThey need to at least pay their share of the utilities and a little more.\n\n I could see if they are still paying a mortgage on a house that is being rebuilt that you could offer a substantially reduced rent. If I had family that were suddenly homeless due to a natural disaster and I had room, I certainly wouldn't be looking to exploit the situation for profit. \n\nWith that said, utilities plus a few hundred dollars for use of a suite is completely fair and reasonable.", "NTA\nNot an idiot either.\nFamilies member screw other family members all the time.  Business with family should be on writing.", "Nope. Not at all.", "NTA first you absolutely need a rental agreement so that everyone is on the same page. Second they absolutely have to pay for the cost and you should be making a profit on it. It\u2019s not like the money is coming out of their pocket! If anyone has an issue with this, they can host them free of charge. Your sister and her husband are being incredibly greedy and entitled!", "NTA. Do not let them move in without a lease or a security deposit.

The audacity of it all! Tell your parents and relatives you're so happy to hear they want to help them out then imply you're going to tell your sister and BIL that they want to help them.\n\nI have a feeling they'll change their tune realllll fast when they think they're going to be the ones burdened with your shockingly entitled sister.", "NTA it's really the best option for everyone involved.

Living situations without contracts/agreements signed can easily get real bad.", "Insurance adjuster here, typically the carrier will pay you directly for the rent and not them. It is also a taxable income meaning you will get a 1099 for the rent money. I would only allow them to stay if the carrier pays you directly. Them wanting to stay for free and pocket the money is insurance fraud and you could be liable too for letting them stay for \"free\".

What happens if the stress of life gets to be too much, one of them starts using drugs, has a dealer stop by, an argument happens and somebody fires a shot that hits your neighbors house?

Insurance is designed to indemnify, which basically means to make you whole as if you haven't suffered a loss.

I feel the same way as you, if they lost their home and were in a bad situation then of course housing them for free would make sense.
