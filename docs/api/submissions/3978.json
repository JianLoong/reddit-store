Our insurance company was based out of Florida though that barley paid off the cost of the house as it was 5 years old, and we got hotel assistance from FEMA. However we could only use the hotel for 1 day because a lot of people were displaced so we ended up bouncing around in our car. Because of that though, my family member caught a federal charge for misappropriation of emergency funds during a natural disaster. This family member served a year in prison and is still on probation, plus they had to pay over $10k in restitution (read they took their tax return for the year even though they had 3 years to pay it off). And that was with a plea deal for someone who had no criminal history because the judge told my family member they wanted to set an example. That charge has a maximum 20 year sentence if found guilty. Plus they can add other charges for fraud of government agencies as well (if the insurance company partnered up with Red Cross or fema like what happened in my family members case). So it is a tale of caution that I want to warn others about.\n\n  I think your solution is reasonable, but I would just make sure that if you did take them in and they paid you, that it wouldn\u2019t be at the cost of your livelihood/freedom.

And the temporary living probs isn't they cost of living it's probs just a portion of it.", "Sadly for OP, ignorance of the law is not a defense. \n\nNTA.", "Genuine question. I don\u2019t have any experience with filing claims with homeowners or renters insurance. But I do with car insurance. When the vehicle was totaled, the insurance wrote a check for the entire amount and didn\u2019t follow up or ask questions to see if I\u2019d used their money on another car, all of it or part of it. \n\nWould taking a check from car insurance and not replacing the vehicle be fraud? Or how would what they\u2019re doing be related to vehicle insurance? Is it more like if they also said they needed a rental vehicle and then didn\u2019t rent the vehicle?", "It may not be insurance fraud, it depends on the terms of the insurance (sometimes you get a payout without having to spend the money for a specific purpose).  As for the OP, she is justified to want rent for providing accommodation, but the demand that the insurance money go into an account to cover potential damage is  ...odd. If she rented out her unit, she wouldn't demand that the tenant make payments for something like that, she would simply ask for a deposit.\n\nOP, since you want to keep this on a business footing, keep yourself out of their dealings with the insurance and offer a traditional lease: deposit and an agreed rent  and terms. But frankly, I would just forget it, this has created animosity between you already.", "I had exactly the same thought. You let them in you will never get them out again, and never get a cent from them. If they are being this obnoxious before you agree to house them, just think how bad it will get once they are wedged tightly in there and unmovable.", "That's what happened with me. They made all the arrangements with the landlord, sent the rent directly to them, and also furnished the apartment with rental furniture. They did deduct the cost of the security deposit from one of the payments that we got because they told us that the security deposit was going to be hours to keep when they returned it.", "It's 2 different checks and OP meant the ones that are supposed to cover them renting a place not the one that's going to rebuild the house.", "HAHAHA just like Vernon, FL, aka \"nub city\".", "Florida has a whole investigative agency for insurance fraud. And insurance fraud does get prosecuted in Florida. And depending on how much money is claimed, OP's sibling can be facing up to a first degree felony.", "Unless you are rich of course. But I don't think OP is that rich.", "Not replacing the car isn't fraud. You lost something worth $X, insurance gave you $X (or $X minus your deductible) for it. Paying you for the list vehicle is what made you whole.\n\nThis is claiming you rented a car while looking for a new one, getting money to pay for the rental car, and then not renting something and driving your sister's car for free instead.", "No. It wouldn\u2019t be, but telling them you need money for a rental car in the meantime and then paying it out under the premise that this is temporary while you purchase something new might be. You have no obligation to buy a new car.", "Once again family needs to pay reasonable rent and reasonable utilities... The money from insurance is none of the OPs business (OP thinks it is). The money for rent and utilities is absolutely OPs business..(family thinks it isn't).. And that's why everyone sucks...", "Wealth is ALWAYS a valid defense.", "It would more be telling them you need a rental car & collecting money for it while driving your mom's car for free.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It doesn't make you a bad person to say no to being taken advantage of. Especially when they ask for help committing insurance fraud *and* expect to keep all the proceeds while still expecting a big handout.", "Yeah, so people should just bankrupt themselves at this time of CoL crisis because they want to be selfish? GTFOH!", "OP only cares about the second one and only to cover damages plus covering the increase in cost of having them there. Not the rest.", "HAHAHA has no one heard of the \"influenza\" defense?", ">And that I would expect all of the money from the Insurance company to go into an account that would cover any damage they did while living with me. \n\nNo OP wants more than just rent and utilities and a deposit... OP wants the full amount of whatever the insurance is in an account they have access too... And thus ESH...", "It was affluenza, and they just said it\u2019s always a valid defense. No one on death row has money.", "It sounds like you perhaps like your sister's company, and that she is a considerate guest and good person who wouldn't take advantage, and would return the favor in your time of need. She would also never expect you to help her commit likely felony-level insurance fraud, making OP an accomplice.\n\nNot everyone has siblings like that. It sounds like OP's sister is quite the opposite from yours, and comes off very entitled. Some folks have terrible family members they don't help for good reasons.\n\nIt's also incredibly difficult to evict someone once they move in, and can cost thousands and take months. What if OP loses her job or gets disabled and needs the income from her extra space? Even if it's free now, that's a security rope for her if anything happened. She may not have savings enough to wait around for an eviction to be completed since entitled folks rarely leave a place where there's free rent willingly.\n\nOP may also know that her sister is the type where, no matter how much you helped them in the past, when OP is the one to need help, she won't be there for her.", "It\u2019s not like OP is charging them over market value; in fact, they are charging them at cost. Why should OP have to spend their money one utilities being used by the couple?", "You're not looking at the rest of the context and you're just picking out small parts to make ignorant opinions.", "This is AITA... Where everyone looks at a post and judges based on the details whether or not they think someone is an AH... I think everyone in this situation sucks... You're entitled to not feel the same way.
