Are they that lazy and lacking in depth that they rather take a stupid chance like that than find their own name?\n\nI put more time/effort into researching our dogs names than she did her own kid.  I don't like dog names that are super common, like Buster, Bella, Max, Buddy....like have some creativity!  You are only forgiven for the lack of foresight if you're 8yrs old and parents begrudgingly let you name the family dog lol.\n\nI'll admit I love it when they have human names, like Steve or Patricia for example...it's cute and funny.\n\nWe went with tree-based/nature names for our dogs, and they are both unique, beautiful names, that we also tied into their official AKC name (normally the kennel/breeder line name along with a theme).\n\nExample, Whiskeytown Captain Morgan Cranberry Kiss, call name Morgan, this was one of the Westminster dogs.  You can get super creative when working with the breeder and the litter theme.

Two days before the birth of SIL baby my MIL dropped the news that SIL changed the baby name to Zaire but spelled so differently that his name will definitely be mispronounced.
