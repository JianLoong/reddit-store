It's literally something that will affect a person's whole life.\n\nWho chooses (or steals) a name without considering it carefully, including looking up meanings, trying it out with the last name, checking for possible nicknames, or what the intials might spell?\n\nSounds like being able to steal \"your \" name was more important to them than actually choosing a name they wanted.", "You're a little bit the asshole, but in the best possible way.

There was a previous story about a woman wanting to name her puppy Cody but was spelling it like Chode, not looking up anything or realizing what the word meant could you imagine if that was a child? A name should be a personal thing not a theft, the name you chose for a girl means nothing to her at all but it could be sentimental for you. My son will be named after my deceased father whom I loved dearly and I want to honor his memory, thankfully I have no pregnant friends or family but if so did I would guard that name with my life because it\u2019s personal and special to me.", "NTA, wow she stole the name?

She was trying to deceive you about the name and was always going to steal it.  What friend does something like that?  It was on her to do the research on the name.

So nope! We decided on James.  \n\n\nFor my 2nd son we were debating between Ezra and Kaine but we couldn't decided on a middle name either and I had posted to my friends about it on FB and they suggested Ezra as his first and Kaine as his second.
