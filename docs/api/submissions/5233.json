I would have preferred a clean break from both him and his mom but have a hard time totally shutting people out.\n\nAnyway, I got married last year and welcomed my first child 6 months ago. This will be my first Christmas with my wife and Child. Shane was going to go visit where his mom lives now for Christmas but do to a pending storm, its uncertain if he will be able to travel there. He called me last night and asked if he could spend Christmas with me...I was definitely got off guard and told him while its good to hear from him, it will be my first Christmas as a whole family and would prefer to keep it to just us and maybe her parents who will stop by later. Shane was very upset, told me I was replacing him. I tried to reason with him that this is just what happens when adults move on in life. I said we could still keep in touch but I wanted Christmas just with my family since it is our first one.\n\nHe hung up and then later sent me a long text saying some not super nice things.

AITA for not wanting him to come over for Christmas?\n\nEdit:Addressing some common Qs\n\nShane's mother and I were never married\n\nShane's father is actively in his life, he just is often out of town\n\nI had only met Shane a few times until he moved in during his High school years. He was very active in sports and extra curriculars so he wasn't actually home that much for us to spend time together. Them moving in was supposed to be temporary after his mom got laid off and it just kinda dragged into them staying.\n\nHis mother was very adamant that Shane had a father and she didn't want me to attempt to parent her kid. While he lived at my house, I was basically an adult roommate. We got along well but it was never a father-son type relationship.

This one's a toughie. I'm not going to judge this situation cause it's hard to know from one post, but I will give some sincere advice:    \n    \nIf you want to continue having a relationship with this kid and want him in your life, maybe reconsider. If he's sending long, aggressive texts, that tells me that on some level he still looks to you as a parental figure and your rejection of him has hurt him deeply. So if you want to keep seeing the kid, try to smooth things out, maybe include him anyways. Family is about more than just blood.    \n    \nOn the other hand, it sounds like maybe you never meant to keep the kid in your life and you two being around each other might do more harm than good in the long run. If so, than it's time to have a rather earnest discussion with him and just let him down gently but firmly.    \n    \nUltimately, you need to commit one way or the other, lest you accidentally cause more damage to him in future.", "Info: did you fill the \"father\" role for this boy? Since you were around for so many years of his life you might be filling that role. From your tone, it sounds like you were never that into him.", "YTA but not for refusing to have him over but for letting this go on for so long after you left. When you divorced his mom he obviously still cared for you and saw you as a part of his family. You let him contact you and you never told him to stop. Now you have your own kid so you dropped him like a hot potato. This is something you should have done when you got a divorce, not years later because no matter how you try to package it, he is right. You have replaced him and that hurts a lot because this is not a toy, it is a person.\n\nYou either make a clean break or you let him be part of the family. You basically choose neither and that is why you have this issue. You should have told him you were no longer a part of the family as soon as you signed those divorce papers. It still would have hurt a lot but that is the proper way of doing things and not just because it is inconvenient for you now. The only good thing is he is an adult now and this will give you the clean break you wanted even if it was the absolute worse way to do it.", "Yikes dude. He was your stepkid basically for 7 years. He's stranded for Christmas. Would it seriously hurt you if he came for Christmas? I am grossed out by this, ngl. If virtually anyone I have a stable relationship of any kind with asked if they could come to my house for Christmas, I would say yes, because it's fucking Christmas. \n\nYTA", "NAH:  I think everyone forgetting there's another person involved here which is OP's new wife.  If it's her plan to have Christmas with just her husband and child it's OP job to honor that.", "Against the grain but NTA at all. You dated his mom for 7 years and lived together for 4 of those years, but never married. I don\u2019t think that means you are now permanently obligated to be a parent to your ex\u2019s kid.

Since you wanted a clean break text him back you didn\u2019t appreciate how he spoke to you it\u2019s best you go NC. Please don\u2019t contact me again. Block his number and maybe let your ex know if you have her number.", "NTA You two are friendly, but you're not family. He can hang out with you other times. It's not your fault the weather interrupted his travel plans, but he presumably has other friends he can ask -- there's no reason this should be your responsibility. Not only is it perfectly reasonable to want privacy at Christmas, but you have a new baby -- that alone is reason enough not to want guests any day of the year.\n\nI'm sorry Y T A is the top comment because it is completely unfair. You don't owe it to this ADULT to provide a family atmosphere at Christmas just because you dated his mother 3 years ago.", "Can\u2019t believe the people that are voting \u201cYTA.\u201d\n\nOP, you are NTA. You and your ex broke up years ago. You have your little family now. Yeah the baby might not remember their first Christmas, but you and your wife will. Happy holidays!", "NTA but honestly your baby isn\u2019t going to remember a 1st Christmas & if they do showing empathy and going above & beyond for someone when not obligated wouldn\u2019t be the worst example to set - especially if you could do one meal or party of the day leaving the rest of the time for your immediate family only. \n\nWanting a clean break is understandable but since you let things linger it seems that shutting it down during the holidays seems a bit harsh", "NAH\nIt's fine to say no and to spend Christmas with wife and newborn. But you should explain him in another way why you did it. And find out what is happening in his life that he wanted to spend it with you instead with somebody else of his family. I have the feeling that he has more issues in his life than just your situation regarding Christmas.", "INFO: would it be possible to spend some time with him Christmas Eve and keep Christmas Day for family?", "NAH - this guy obviously thought you were closer than you did, which is a shame for him, especially since you haven't been clear that you don't seem to want much of a relationship with him anymore.  I don't blame him for asking, he's probably really bummed to be alone on Christmas, but at the same time, I understand your desire to move on, and to have a small Christmas for just your family.", "NTA\n\nHonestly its time for a clean break. You never accepted the parental role with him and he's old enough to understand boundaries. The holidays are about sharing but, I think that after 3 years of you no longer being involved with his mother he needs to move on as well.", "You are an absolute arsehole for this, way to act like you never had a single impact on his life and absolve yourself of all responsibility for his feelings when you were in his life between ages 11-18 as his step father. Claim you didn't raise him all you like, you are one callous motherfucker and I believe you didn't take responsibility for him, you were still an adult in his life during his formative years who has now abandoned him. \n\nYour poor bio kid doesn't have a fucking chance.", "NTA Shane is not your family. It doesn\u2019t matter that you were in his life for seven years. Not everyone will be in your life forever. His parents can celebrate Christmas with him later. Your priority is your wife and child not the adult child of an ex girlfriend.", "NTA. An unbelievable number of people commenting YTA don't seem to have actually read the post.\n1. OP did not take on a father role, he was explicitly told by Shane's mom she didn't want that\n2. Shane's father was and is still in his life and regarded by him as his father\n3. They weren't married (not that important but people can't read)\n4. Everyone crying that Shane has nowhere to go, will be left alone at Christmas, etc - OP states he could travel to spend Christmas with friends or family\n5. Lots are criticizing OP for letting the situation go on as long as it has, but then want him to double down and have him over for an awkward Christmas with a family he's no longer part of and make it even more difficult to separate properly?? Smh.", "Yta. If you wanted a clean break then you should have done it when you broke up years ago. You stayed around and have a relationship with him so what you did to me was out of line. He has nowhere else to go on xmas and you said no? Like the guy could be the one taking all your pictures on xmas to remember at least anyway.", "YTA. You created a father-son relationship with a young boy that lasted many years. You created a responsibility for yourself and it doesn\u2019t just disappear when you broke up with his mom.  How terribly sad for this guy.", "Awww that\u2019s sad. NTA, but I still feel really bad for Shane. My parents ex still views us as family and would love to have us for the holidays. But my parents new spouse would flip if it was them in your new wife\u2019s position\u2026so I get it.", "A soft YTA. I do understand wanting to keep Christmas to just your immediate family, especially since it's Baby's first Christmas, but someone who was basically your stepkid during very formative years of his life has nowhere to go on a holiday and you won't even invite him to join a portion of your day? \n\nI understand adults move on, but you were a father figure to him so it's reasonable he feels hurt. You could have at least told a white lie about being unavailable to host rather than telling him you didn't want him there.", "NTA you got to remember you were in his life for 7 years and kept in touch for another 3. While no he is not your son, he is your step son (more or less). He's very much going to view you as a parent who left him. While you have no obligation to him and hence NTA, it still sucks to be on the receiving end of that especially for the holidays. If I were you I wouldn't expect to have any relationship with him ever again though.", "I\u2019m just crying for Shane now . What harm would it be to let  him come by & spend time with y\u2019all vs his being alone for Christmas.    I hope he has a friend who\u2019s parents live nearby to spend Christmas with \u2026and they are not so selfish .", "YTA - you were part of life for 7 years, technically his stepdad for 4 years and you guys have kept in touch, even though it sounds like he's done most of the reaching out (shame on you). I would NEVER let my step child (even a former one) spend xmas alone like that. It was pretty cold and you definitely should apologize.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a direct tie to him anymore. Even if you did, it\u2019s up to you entirely who you spend your holidays with.", "You've been a part of Shane's life since he was 11.  You married his mom, effectively becoming a parent to Shane.  And now you want to decide that he's inconvenient because you and his mom didn't work out?  I understand he's 21, but that's still a hard thing for him to hear.  I think I have to go YTA on this.", "I may be in the minority on this, but imho NTA. It totally makes sense that you no longer want to play \"dad\" for someone whose mother you broke up with three years ago, and who is now a grown man himself. (I would feel differently if you had just broken up with Shane's mom, or if Shane was a lot younger.) \n\nYes, Shane has been replaced, or maybe more accurately, he and his mother have been removed from your life. This is not personal, just reality based on what happens when two people break up. He has had *three years* to come to terms with this. If it's not happening by now, he needs to see a therapist, not continue to try and insist that he should remain part of your new life. I'm sorry for this young man on Christmas, but you are not going to do him any favors by including him out of pity in a family gathering where he is not family and his presence is unwelcome.", "YTA \n\nThis kid was probably 11 when you met, and I'm guessing you're the only father figure in his life? \n\nYou didn't have to have him over for Xmas, but something tells me he knew you don't want him around.", "Kinda NTA, but kinda YTA: I like your wife sympathize with him, as he was only 11 years old and through his whole remaining childhood you have been a father figure. And instead of cutting it off you shrug him alone and still provide a father figure role for 3 years. Now out of nowhere you have a baby and he just out of luck, with no warning or anything. \n\nWhile I do sympathize with him, this is your family and you house. You are not obligated to do anything for him. I just think you are AH for prolonging it for 3 years. While he is an adult, any one can be hurt by a parent rejection.

And dog gone it, children of divorce have already been through enough!!!!\n\nMy BIL took this advice to heart.  He dated (women threw themselves at him), but he never introduced them to his daughter. He was also very upfront with the women he dated and told them that he would not remarry until she was grown as she had been through enough.

He looked up to you as his example of what a man should be.  And he still loves you for being his step-father.  \n\nThen you told him that you don't consider him family.  That's bound to be extremely hurtful.  \n\nReally, how hard would it be for him to come to you for the afternoon?  To have his Christmas dinner with  people instead of on his own?
