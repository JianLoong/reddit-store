I was with my ex for about 7 years (never married), lived together the last 4.Broke up 3 years ago.

We've moderately kept in touch since the breakup, mostly just when he reaches out to me. I would have preferred a clean break from both him and his mom but have a hard time totally shutting people out. I have not seen Shane in person since he was 18.\n\nAnyway, I got married last year and welcomed my first child 6 months ago. This will be my first Christmas with my wife and Child. Shane was going to go visit where his mom lives now for Christmas but do to a pending storm, its uncertain if he will be able to travel there. He called me last night and asked if he could spend Christmas with me...I was definitely got off guard and told him while its good to hear from him, it will be my first Christmas as a whole family and would prefer to keep it to just us and maybe her parents who will stop by later. Shane was very upset, told me I was replacing him. I tried to reason with him that this is just what happens when adults move on in life. I said we could still keep in touch but I wanted Christmas just with my family since it is our first one.\n\nHe hung up and then later sent me a long text saying some not super nice things. My wife is glad I said no but at the same time says she empathizes with how he feels and I should apologize but not necessarily have him over, but would support me if thats what I want. AITA for not wanting him to come over for Christmas?\n\nEdit:Addressing some common Qs\n\nShane's mother and I were never married\n\nShane's father is actively in his life, he just is often out of town\n\nI had only met Shane a few times until he moved in during his High school years. He was very active in sports and extra curriculars so he wasn't actually home that much for us to spend time together. Them moving in was supposed to be temporary after his mom got laid off and it just kinda dragged into them staying.\n\nHis mother was very adamant that Shane had a father and she didn't want me to attempt to parent her kid. While he lived at my house, I was basically an adult roommate. We got along well but it was never a father-son type relationship.", "created_utc": 1671567473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqyh40/aita_for_not_wanting_my_exs_son_at_my_christmas/", "score": 1263, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This one's a toughie. I'm not going to judge this situation cause it's hard to know from one post, but I will give some sincere advice:    \n    \nIf you want to continue having a relationship with this kid and want him in your life, maybe reconsider. If he's sending long, aggressive texts, that tells me that on some level he still looks to you as a parental figure and your rejection of him has hurt him deeply. So if you want to keep seeing the kid, try to smooth things out, maybe include him anyways. Family is about more than just blood.    \n    \nOn the other hand, it sounds like maybe you never meant to keep the kid in your life and you two being around each other might do more harm than good in the long run. If so, than it's time to have a rather earnest discussion with him and just let him down gently but firmly.    \n    \nUltimately, you need to commit one way or the other, lest you accidentally cause more damage to him in future.", "Info: did you fill the \"father\" role for this boy? Since you were around for so many years of his life you might be filling that role. From your tone, it sounds like you were never that into him.", "YTA but not for refusing to have him over but for letting this go on for so long after you left. When you divorced his mom he obviously still cared for you and saw you as a part of his family. You let him contact you and you never told him to stop. Now you have your own kid so you dropped him like a hot potato. This is something you should have done when you got a divorce, not years later because no matter how you try to package it, he is right. You have replaced him and that hurts a lot because this is not a toy, it is a person.\n\nYou either make a clean break or you let him be part of the family. You basically choose neither and that is why you have this issue. You should have told him you were no longer a part of the family as soon as you signed those divorce papers. It still would have hurt a lot but that is the proper way of doing things and not just because it is inconvenient for you now. The only good thing is he is an adult now and this will give you the clean break you wanted even if it was the absolute worse way to do it.", "Yikes dude. He was your stepkid basically for 7 years. He's stranded for Christmas. Would it seriously hurt you if he came for Christmas? I am grossed out by this, ngl. If virtually anyone I have a stable relationship of any kind with asked if they could come to my house for Christmas, I would say yes, because it's fucking Christmas. \n\nYTA", "NAH:  I think everyone forgetting there's another person involved here which is OP's new wife.

You dated his mom for 7 years and lived together for 4 of those years, but never married. I don\u2019t think that means you are now permanently obligated to be a parent to your ex\u2019s kid.

It's not your fault the weather interrupted his travel plans, but he presumably has other friends he can ask -- there's no reason this should be your responsibility. Not only is it perfectly reasonable to want privacy at Christmas, but you have a new baby -- that alone is reason enough not to want guests any day of the year.\n\nI'm sorry Y T A is the top comment because it is completely unfair. You don't owe it to this ADULT to provide a family atmosphere at Christmas just because you dated his mother 3 years ago.", "Can\u2019t believe the people that are voting \u201cYTA.\u201d\n\nOP, you are NTA. You and your ex broke up years ago. You have your little family now. Yeah the baby might not remember their first Christmas, but you and your wife will.

But you should explain him in another way why you did it. And find out what is happening in his life that he wanted to spend it with you instead with somebody else of his family.

I don't blame him for asking, he's probably really bummed to be alone on Christmas, but at the same time, I understand your desire to move on, and to have a small Christmas for just your family.", "NTA\n\nHonestly its time for a clean break. You never accepted the parental role with him and he's old enough to understand boundaries. The holidays are about sharing but, I think that after 3 years of you no longer being involved with his mother he needs to move on as well.", "[removed]", "NTA Shane is not your family. It doesn\u2019t matter that you were in his life for seven years. Not everyone will be in your life forever. His parents can celebrate Christmas with him later.

OP did not take on a father role, he was explicitly told by Shane's mom she didn't want that\n2. Shane's father was and is still in his life and regarded by him as his father\n3. They weren't married (not that important but people can't read)\n4. Everyone crying that Shane has nowhere to go, will be left alone at Christmas, etc - OP states he could travel to spend Christmas with friends or family\n5. Lots are criticizing OP for letting the situation go on as long as it has, but then want him to double down and have him over for an awkward Christmas with a family he's no longer part of and make it even more difficult to separate properly?? Smh.", "Yta. If you wanted a clean break then you should have done it when you broke up years ago. You stayed around and have a relationship with him so what you did to me was out of line. He has nowhere else to go on xmas and you said no? Like the guy could be the one taking all your pictures on xmas to remember at least anyway.", "YTA. You created a father-son relationship with a young boy that lasted many years. You created a responsibility for yourself and it doesn\u2019t just disappear when you broke up with his mom.  How terribly sad for this guy.", "Awww that\u2019s sad. NTA, but I still feel really bad for Shane. My parents ex still views us as family and would love to have us for the holidays. But my parents new spouse would flip if it was them in your new wife\u2019s position\u2026so I get it.", "A soft YTA. I do understand wanting to keep Christmas to just your immediate family, especially since it's Baby's first Christmas, but someone who was basically your stepkid during very formative years of his life has nowhere to go on a holiday and you won't even invite him to join a portion of your day? \n\nI understand adults move on, but you were a father figure to him so it's reasonable he feels hurt. You could have at least told a white lie about being unavailable to host rather than telling him you didn't want him there.", "NTA you got to remember you were in his life for 7 years and kept in touch for another 3. While no he is not your son, he is your step son (more or less). He's very much going to view you as a parent who left him.

If I were you I wouldn't expect to have any relationship with him ever again though.", "I\u2019m just crying for Shane now . What harm would it be to let  him come by & spend time with y\u2019all vs his being alone for Christmas.

I would NEVER let my step child (even a former one) spend xmas alone like that. It was pretty cold and you definitely should apologize.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a direct tie to him anymore. Even if you did, it\u2019s up to you entirely who you spend your holidays with.", "You've been a part of Shane's life since he was 11.  You married his mom, effectively becoming a parent to Shane.

I think I have to go YTA on this.", "I may be in the minority on this, but imho NTA. It totally makes sense that you no longer want to play \"dad\" for someone whose mother you broke up with three years ago, and who is now a grown man himself. (I would feel differently if you had just broken up with Shane's mom, or if Shane was a lot younger.) \n\nYes, Shane has been replaced, or maybe more accurately, he and his mother have been removed from your life. This is not personal, just reality based on what happens when two people break up. He has had *three years* to come to terms with this. If it's not happening by now, he needs to see a therapist, not continue to try and insist that he should remain part of your new life. I'm sorry for this young man on Christmas, but you are not going to do him any favors by including him out of pity in a family gathering where he is not family and his presence is unwelcome.", "YTA \n\nThis kid was probably 11 when you met, and I'm guessing you're the only father figure in his life? \n\nYou didn't have to have him over for Xmas, but something tells me he knew you don't want him around.", "Kinda NTA, but kinda YTA: I like your wife sympathize with him, as he was only 11 years old and through his whole remaining childhood you have been a father figure. And instead of cutting it off you shrug him alone and still provide a father figure role for 3 years. Now out of nowhere you have a baby and he just out of luck, with no warning or anything. \n\nWhile I do sympathize with him, this is your family and you house.

And dog gone it, children of divorce have already been through enough!!!!\n\nMy BIL took this advice to heart.  He dated (women threw themselves at him), but he never introduced them to his daughter.

You want to be with your new family; however, you were in this kids life during most of his formative growth years. You were there for about 50% of his life that he could remember up until you and his mom broke up. He's attached to you. He's not an asshole for wanting to keep that attachment he formed with you, either.", "I\u2019d say YTA.\n\nThis is not in the spirit of Christmas. Josef and Maria were taken in by strangers and given a place to stay. Jesus praised kindness and love thy next constantly. This is actually what this holiday is about.\n\nHe might not be your next of kin but he is a person who has no one to spend Christmas with due force majeure and who has asked you to share this holiday as to not be alone.\nIt could even just be dinner or something.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be kind. Why are you choosing not to?", "Yta", "I was going with N A H. (At least until his response to your rejection.) He could ask and you can say no. Knowing him from 11-18 followed by three years of not seeing each other doesn't mean you owe him a relationship. I don't think you'd be in the wrong for rescinding your offer to stay in touch after how he spoke to you. He said you're replacing him like he viewed you as his father at any point. That sounds very confusing since neither of you placed you in the fatherly role.  He's an adult now. He should start learning to understand breakups and changes in life. \n\nNTA", "NTA just let the friendship die here naturally.", "NTA", "Poor guy, alone for Christmas. You aren't an asshole, but you aren't very Christian either. You know, that whole thing that Christmas is about? I get the whole new family thing too, shitty situation to find oneself in, and Shane didn't help his cause by getting upset. Instead of looking at him as your exes son, why not see him as a friend of a friend who is going to be alone for Christmas? Frames it differently doesn't it?", "NTA\n\nLived with you from 14 to 18, hasnt seen you since then.  Seems very strange to be claiming you are replacing him.", "I'm going with a soft YTA in this case.\n\nNot because you said no regarding Christmas. But you were a part of Shane's life in his formative years.\n\nI don't think you have parental responsibilities in this situation, given the reasons you have stated. But when he says \"you're replacing me\", it seems that he has a very different view on your relationship than you do. I don't think Shane is right, but it tells me you two are very out of phase regarding this issue.\n\nYou owe Shane a serious discussion about what part of his life you can be. My impression from your post is that you are a little non-confrontational. I think a proper discussion would save Shane a lot of hurt.", "Sure the baby won't remember their first Christmas, HOWEVER with all the different illnesses flying around, it is not unreasonable at all for OP to save the lessons in empathy for another time. So many young babies are hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or covid right now that it isn't worth the risk to invite any person who is not in the inner, trusted circle. And the ex's son, who has not seen OP in person in over 3 years, is not in the inner circle and is a risk due to being on a campus full of other people. So it's entirely reasonable for OP to refuse to subject his little family to that risk.\n\nMy nephew had to be hospitalized at 5 months with RSV. He just had a relapse at a year old. It was absolutely awful to see updates of him struggling to breathe in a hospital cot with wires sticking out of him. I would never begrudge a parent for wanting to protect their young baby from that.", "That's great for you, but that doesn't mean everyone is obligated to open their house up to people they don't feel close to. I personally would never invite myself over for Christmas to the house os someone I hadn't seen in person for 3 years, that's not a close relationship any more. Also, having someone over for an intimate family celebration is awkward; if the OP was having a huge party, he should have agreed.", "My family have always taken people in that would be alone at Christmas - over various years this has included one brother\u2019s roommate, my friend from school, at least two of my older brother\u2019s colleagues and some of grandma\u2019s elderly friends. Often these have been people the other family members don\u2019t know, but we\u2019d rather welcome someone into our home than let them be alone on Christmas Day. \n\nI can see why OP doesn\u2019t want to, it just feels like the exact opposite of the spirit of Christmas \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Shane doesn't want to spend Christmas with OP, his mum's ex boyfriend. He's only got in touch because Christmas with his family, the people he really wants to spend Christmas with, is in jeopardy. OP is a convenient back up plan for an adult whose travel plans may get disrupted. That's all, OP is not breaking anyone's heart as Shane wouldn't have even called to wish him a merry Christmas if he could go home to his actual family as planned.", "Right! I was surprised when I read the comments, obligating OP to invite the ADULT SON OF HIS EX, and not respecting his wish to celebrate intimately with his wife and newborn baby. They were all telling accounts of how their house is an open one and it is all for the spirit of holidays, disregarding the fact that people have different ways to celebrate.", "You may not have been a parent figure, but he clearly saw you as an adult he could trust and care about. I grew attached to family friends growing up, they meant a lot to me even if we were not related. Hell, I have grown attached to roommates I lived with because they were closer than family. \n\nCleanly break it off with the kid so he can focus on connecting with people who care for him, unlike you.", "I mean, if he raised or lived with that kid. Then, he is kinda a part of his family. Idk, I feel that way about it. When a stel-father raises a kid, they become his kid too.", "That's your choice, but OP is allowed to feel different. Christmas can be private if people want it to be.", "Right? The poor kid was stranded due to a storm and is now spending Xmas all alone bc he can\u2019t travel to his mom? Yeah I\u2019d have given him a place at my table too. Op. YTA", "He's not taking no for an answer. Op is trying to break from him. If he invites him to Christmas, what will he want from him then? Birthdays? Easter? Thanksgiving? Give these people an inch and they'll take a mile. He wasn't even a father figure. If this kid looks at him that way he should re-evaluate his relationships with his parents.", "Imo, it is normal for him to be sad when the man he loved as a dad doesn't want him anymore.", "He\u2019s not obligated to keep in touch lol", "His wife will though. She gets a say who is at her own house.", "But, he was the step-parent. He raised the boy.", "I think my problem with the situation is mainly that it seems OP is not clear about the situation. Shane seems to think OP still has a minor step-father role, while OP doesn't think so.\n\nI agree with the people saying he doesn't have parental responsibilities (with the limited information given by a Reddit post), but I believe that OP needs to have a real discussion with Shane about the way forward.", "Yes OP is allowed to feel different. And when he comes to a forum for our OPINIONS. I'm allowed to give my opinion.  Lol Ike that's literally the whole point of the thread", "Is the dad actively involved though or just slightly more involved than OP, who said the dad travels a lot for work? It\u2019s possible Shane is used to parental figures being pretty uninvolved so he didn\u2019t recognize that his view of the relationship with OP was wildly different from OP.", "You take him in then if you're that bothered. Honestly Op has no obligation to take someone in. His wife and child are strangers to him. Everyone can do whatever they choose to do. Wanting a private holiday without guests is hardly an AH move. Sheesh.", "He is. He was never a father or even step father to this kid. He has a dad in the picture. His mother didn't want him parenting him. Being around for 7 years is nothing when you consider he wasn't around a great deal and they basically had a roommate type relationship.  He's obviously got the wrong impression of what this relationship really was. Op has every right to move on with a new family without him. He has no legal or moral obligation. His parents do though.", "I guess I just feel it is unfair to expect someone to open their home to someone they don't want. I was trying to discuss that, not trying to imply that you feel your opinion is the only. My bad.", "He wasn't a stepson. You have to be married to mum to be a stepdad. He wasn't married to her. He has absolutely nothing to do with this young man. Why don't you invite Op that you'll take him in if it bothers you that much?", "Shane's dad is,actively involved in his life, OP isn't and never was a step parent to him at the behest of his mother.\n\nHes NTA.", "Nah you good.  I'm but I'm trying to say is, it was asked why the people who said YTA said as such. And I'm just trying to explain that the reason WHY HE didn't want them, someone he knew intimately, and who he didn't say was a bad person in any shape or form, wasn't allowed when they were stranded in his town... It doesn't very Christmasy.   Not only would I not do that to my ex son in law.  But I wouldn't even do it to a friend of a friend I haven't met.  I'm not saying he's an asshole, but I also don't cheer his decision and that's why they feel that way.", "Why the hell should he? He's nothing to do with him. Neither legally or emotionally. If you give a damn so much, you take him in. Sheesh.\n\nETA: Comparing it to racism? Really? Besides, he's not getting the hint that OP wants to break the tie between them. Inviting him would be sending the wrong message. What will he ask for next? Birthdays? Thanksgiving?", "If all those that think he's an asshole are so concerned, they should just invite him in instead. He's been trying to break it off for a while but he won't listen. What next after Christmas? Thanksgiving? Easter? Birthdays? If he invites him this time, who's to say he'll stop there? No means no. Reddit's favourite saying is \"no is a complete sentence\".", "I can see where you are coming from. If at any point in their relationship OP was ok with being called \"dad\" or something like that, maybe I'd feel differently. It just seems like this guy should have been a bit more clear that he wanted a clean break. Personally, I'd only want my partner, potential kids and *very* close friends at my Christmas. I'm not the type to open my house to people I don't know well, but it's nice that you would consider it.", "They weren't married. He wasn't his stepson. I don't understand people thinking he should take him in. He's moved on and his got a new wife and baby to think about. The wife and baby are strangers to him. No one has the right to guilt him into taking in a young man he barely knows. It's not op's fault he's stuck somewhere because of the weather. It's easy to sit and say these things when it's not our lives we're talking about.", "He was NEVER his step dad. You have to be married to the mother to be one. He wasn't married to her.", "If you're so bothered why don't YOU take him in?", "Well I guess if OP wasn't clear that he wanted absolutely nothing to do with the kid, can't front the kid for feeling blindsided on Christmas lol.  \nAnd you're free to keep your house closed, but I can still have my feels on the situation above.  Not gonna cheer for it.", "From OP\u2019s perspective- a lot of couples don\u2019t get married and Shane and his mother lived with OP for years. How is a teenager supposed to recognize when their parents partner goes from roommate to stepfather? Does marriage magically create a bond? It makes sense that Shane would view his mother\u2019s SO of seven years as a stepfather figure.", "\"Little to nothing\" it actually costs him having a person at his Christmas he doesn't want there, so it kind of wouldn't be \"little to nothing\" at all. You're just upset that OP doesn't fit your internal narrative of a perfectly moral person who never thinks of themselves or their own comfort. That isn't realistic."]}
