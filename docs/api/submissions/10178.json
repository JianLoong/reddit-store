For some context, my boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together for a little over 6 years. I adore him and I couldn\u2019t ask for any better, he\u2019s amazing. He works as a landscaper with his Uncle until he\u2019s saved up enough to start his own business, which he absolutely loves and is great at his work. Now for the story. When the COVID regulations started calming down here in the UK, my boyfriend offered to do some work on my mother\u2019s (55F) garden which was definitely needed, so he went ahead with it and the garden turned out gorgeous. My mother has some bad joint pain issues so she couldn\u2019t sort the garden herself and she loves sitting outside to read her books in the summer so she was thrilled. My boyfriend told her that all she needed to do (in consideration with her joint pains) to keep it looking good was cut the grass every few weeks and put weed killer around the path going up our garden, just nice easy steps that wouldn\u2019t be too difficult for her, which she agreed on. 2 years later and she\u2019s not done a single bit of care for the garden, she\u2019s dumped loads of old furniture and waste around it, hasn\u2019t cut the grass, basically the garden is just a mess again full of waste and rubbish. The other day she asked my boyfriend if he could redo the garden like he did last time. I asked her if she\u2019d been keeping on top of what my boyfriend told her to do, which I already knew the answer to, she said \u201cno, but why would I when I\u2019ve got a landscaper in the family?\u201d. Bare in mind she doesn\u2019t expect to be charged for any of the work my boyfriend does because she\u2019s family. I told her that either she pays him for his work or she actually takes care of the garden like he told her to, because he\u2019s not going to keep doing this for free when she\u2019s not making the effort to keep it tidy. I explained the situation to my boyfriend and I told him not to do the work my mother\u2019s requesting, and he agreed. He\u2019d already seen the state of the garden and told my mother himself that he\u2019s not doing it again unless she can keep it clean. She called me afterwards to let me know that she\u2019s hiring her own new landscaper who will be \u201cmore fair\u201d than us. I asked her why she agreed on doing little things to keep it tidy if she felt like she couldn\u2019t, we could\u2019ve compromised on something else. Her reply was \u201cI expect family to help me out, I shouldn\u2019t have to do anything I don\u2019t want to do especially in my own house or garden\u201d. She\u2019s now not talking to me or my boyfriend. AITA?\n\nUpdate: \nWow! Thanks so much for the response. As for an update, she still isn\u2019t talking to me, but I\u2019ve spoken to my sisters and they all agree with me, they\u2019re going to try and talk some sense in to her as I don\u2019t want to poke the bear lol!

I think a lot of people really don't understand the distinction between a landscaper, who designs a yard and makes it look good by planting flowers, trees, etc, and a yard maintenance person who does the mowing and the spraying, etc. I know she's not speaking to you, but it might be worth it to make one last effort to explain this to her.
