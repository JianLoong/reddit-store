For some context, my boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together for a little over 6 years. I adore him and I couldn\u2019t ask for any better, he\u2019s amazing. He works as a landscaper with his Uncle until he\u2019s saved up enough to start his own business, which he absolutely loves and is great at his work. Now for the story. When the COVID regulations started calming down here in the UK, my boyfriend offered to do some work on my mother\u2019s (55F) garden which was definitely needed, so he went ahead with it and the garden turned out gorgeous. My mother has some bad joint pain issues so she couldn\u2019t sort the garden herself and she loves sitting outside to read her books in the summer so she was thrilled. My boyfriend told her that all she needed to do (in consideration with her joint pains) to keep it looking good was cut the grass every few weeks and put weed killer around the path going up our garden, just nice easy steps that wouldn\u2019t be too difficult for her, which she agreed on. 2 years later and she\u2019s not done a single bit of care for the garden, she\u2019s dumped loads of old furniture and waste around it, hasn\u2019t cut the grass, basically the garden is just a mess again full of waste and rubbish. The other day she asked my boyfriend if he could redo the garden like he did last time. I asked her if she\u2019d been keeping on top of what my boyfriend told her to do, which I already knew the answer to, she said \u201cno, but why would I when I\u2019ve got a landscaper in the family?\u201d. Bare in mind she doesn\u2019t expect to be charged for any of the work my boyfriend does because she\u2019s family. I told her that either she pays him for his work or she actually takes care of the garden like he told her to, because he\u2019s not going to keep doing this for free when she\u2019s not making the effort to keep it tidy. I explained the situation to my boyfriend and I told him not to do the work my mother\u2019s requesting, and he agreed. He\u2019d already seen the state of the garden and told my mother himself that he\u2019s not doing it again unless she can keep it clean. She called me afterwards to let me know that she\u2019s hiring her own new landscaper who will be \u201cmore fair\u201d than us. I asked her why she agreed on doing little things to keep it tidy if she felt like she couldn\u2019t, we could\u2019ve compromised on something else. Her reply was \u201cI expect family to help me out, I shouldn\u2019t have to do anything I don\u2019t want to do especially in my own house or garden\u201d. She\u2019s now not talking to me or my boyfriend.

Your mom sounds pretty entitled.", "Yta \n\nIf he's willing to help your mother when you are not. Why is that such a bad thing?   \n\nIt's his time. His choice.  Let him go if that's what he wants.", "Literally even children know that you frequently have to do things you don\u2019t want to do, even in your own home.", ">\u201cI expect family to help me out, I shouldn\u2019t have to do anything I don\u2019t want to do especially in my own house or garden.\"\n\nHe had already said that he would not do anything more, because she did not keep to the agreement.\n\nHer mother thinks she is entitled to a tidy garden for free and doesn't have to do anything herself, but it doesn't work that way", ">I shouldn\u2019t have to do anything I don\u2019t want to do especially in my own house or garden\n\nYeah, I had the same attitude for the first two weeks after leaving home to go to college. I learned real quick that it's not sustainable approach and that being an adult means doing chores that aren't fun and aren't necessarily what you 'want' to do in your spare time. \n\nHow your mom hasn't learned that lesson at age 55 and after raising a kid is a bit astounding to me.", "NTA, but I kinda feel it wasn't really your place to turn down that request. \n\nIt sounds like your BF is aware of the situation, and if he wants to help your mom out despite the fact that she didn't keep up with upkeep, he's allowed to make that decision for himself.", "Wow. Just .... wow.\n\nMy garden is a horrific mess. I'd love it if someone 'magically' got it into a good state for me to be be able to sit in and enjoy it, and for it to be low-maintenance enough that  I could just  potter around dead-heading a few flowers and sprinkling weed killer on the troublesome bits  (hell, I'd even buy a floppy hat so I looked the part)  especially if they were kind enough to do this for nothing because I'm family.\n\nI've asked a couple of people for quotes to get it even a little nicer, and we're talking 4 figures.\n\nYou are NTA. Your green-fingered and very generous & talented BF is NTA. Your mother ....? Ungrateful and definitely an a.h. It must have broken your BF's heart to see how she'd destroyed all his hard work.\n\nI am also in the UK and will adopt you & your boyfriend if he would help me sort out my muddy pit. I would also keep it nice, and invite you around regularly to drink wine and eat canapes out there with me.", "NTA.  Wow, Mom, entitled much?", "NTA - She then should have offered to buy your BF for his work. He is a landscaper afterall. This is a chance to walk away and find customers for your BF that value his time and efforts.", "NTA - She's right, she shouldn't have to do anything she doesn't want to. Same thing goes for you and your BF. Especially if it is for HER in HER house or garden.", "NTA - your mother has the nerve, my word", "Your mom:  \"well fine then if you won't landscape my garden for free, then I'll just pay someone to do it!  And after how unpleasant I've been to you, I just won't talk to you!  I'll leave you alone!\"\n\nSounds like it all worked out fine?", "NTA", "Nta....amd your mom is right. She is free to do or not do anything in her house....and you and bf are free to not help out after she refused to do the bare minimum. Now she can pay someone else to do her work.", "Helping her every 2 years doesn't seem like a huge ask.", "Yeah, when she sees how much thus work is actually going to cost, I ber she changes her tune.", "A professional who gets paid won\u2019t ask her to do work, or complain about rubbish being dumped. They\u2019ll just do the work for pay, and if she gets too demanding or the dumping gets too onerous, they will no longer have space in their schedule and she can move on to the next landscaper. Who may well charge a rubbish removal fee. I would.", "No. She was exactly the one to handle her mother. Look how she handled her own child, she will make an enemy of the bf and twist whatever he says. Better her than him imo"]}
