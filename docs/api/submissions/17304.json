Yesterday was Mother's day and my husband is notoriously bad at gift-giving and that sort of thing.  I have rather specific taste so I pretty much have to coach him on what I want for birthdays, Xmas, anniversary, etc.  But to my surprise, yesterday he actually did a pretty good job.  He had the kids all make me hand-made cards, made me breakfast in bed, and took the kids out of the house for the afternoon so I could get a mani-pedi and relax, and got me a nice bottle of wine with some fancy cheese and chocolate.  \n\nLast night after the kids went to bed, I thanked him for a great day and expressed how surprised I was that he actually stepped up.  He told me I deserve it, but also said that he hopes that I can do something similar for him for Father's day this year.  I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he asked me if I remember what I did for Father's day last year, but I couldn't remember.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I did nothing for him for Father's day last year.  Then I remembered that for Father's day last year I was at my sister's wedding.  My younger sister had a small, out-of-state, childfree wedding last June, which happened to be on Father's day weekend.  I was the Maid of Honor and since our kids couldn't come, my husband stayed home with them while I was gone from Thursday-Sunday.  \n\nI had every intention of still doing something for him for Father's day, but I must have completely forgotten and he never brought it up to me.  So I felt a little blindsided and put on the spot when he asked me to remember what I did.  \n\nI told him that I'm sorry I forgot to do anything for him last year, but that I don't appreciate being put on the spot like that.  I also don't appreciate the implication that I purposely forgot or did nothing for him on purpose.  I had a lot of things going on at that time last year and I fully admit that I spaced it out and completely forgot.  That's my fault and I accept it, but don't rub my face in it.  \n\nI asked him why he didn't just bring it up to me and he said it's not his responsibility to remind me about that sort of thing.  He said he didn't bring it up because he figured I would just get defensive about it and try to make excuses, exactly like I was doing right then.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I also \"forgot\" to get him anything for his birthday last year.  I told him that I didn't forget, his gift was just delivered late.  He then told me that he has access to our Prime account too and he saw that I didn't even order it until the day of his birthday.  \n\nI told him he was being a jerk and ruining what was up until then, a perfectly good Mother's day.  He said he' not trying to be a jerk, he's just letting me know that he needs to feel that there is some reciprocation for these kind of things.\n\nNow I feel like he only stepped up so he could rub it in my face that I didn't do anything for him last year.", "created_utc": 1684165479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ibuq2/aita_for_forgetting_what_i_did_for_my_husband_for/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yesterday was Mother's day and my husband is notoriously bad at gift-giving and that sort of thing.  I have rather specific taste so I pretty much have to coach him on what I want for birthdays, Xmas, anniversary, etc.  But to my surprise, yesterday he actually did a pretty good job.  He had the kids all make me hand-made cards, made me breakfast in bed, and took the kids out of the house for the afternoon so I could get a mani-pedi and relax, and got me a nice bottle of wine with some fancy cheese and chocolate.  \n\nLast night after the kids went to bed, I thanked him for a great day and expressed how surprised I was that he actually stepped up.  He told me I deserve it, but also said that he hopes that I can do something similar for him for Father's day this year.  I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he asked me if I remember what I did for Father's day last year, but I couldn't remember.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I did nothing for him for Father's day last year.  Then I remembered that for Father's day last year I was at my sister's wedding.  My younger sister had a small, out-of-state, childfree wedding last June, which happened to be on Father's day weekend.  I was the Maid of Honor and since our kids couldn't come, my husband stayed home with them while I was gone from Thursday-Sunday.  \n\nI had every intention of still doing something for him for Father's day, but I must have completely forgotten and he never brought it up to me.  So I felt a little blindsided and put on the spot when he asked me to remember what I did.  \n\nI told him that I'm sorry I forgot to do anything for him last year, but that I don't appreciate being put on the spot like that.  I also don't appreciate the implication that I purposely forgot or did nothing for him on purpose.  I had a lot of things going on at that time last year and I fully admit that I spaced it out and completely forgot.  That's my fault and I accept it, but don't rub my face in it.  \n\nI asked him why he didn't just bring it up to me and he said it's not his responsibility to remind me about that sort of thing.  He said he didn't bring it up because he figured I would just get defensive about it and try to make excuses, exactly like I was doing right then.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I also \"forgot\" to get him anything for his birthday last year.  I told him that I didn't forget, his gift was just delivered late.  He then told me that he has access to our Prime account too and he saw that I didn't even order it until the day of his birthday.  \n\nI told him he was being a jerk and ruining what was up until then, a perfectly good Mother's day.  He said he' not trying to be a jerk, he's just letting me know that he needs to feel that there is some reciprocation for these kind of things.\n\nNow I feel like he only stepped up so he could rub it in my face that I didn't do anything for him last year.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I almost guarantee he was hoping for some sort of gift, or at the very least recognition, when you returned to town. \n\nThe fact he remembered it for this long tells you everything you need to know. Your husband might not resent you in a traditional way because of this, but the fact that you don\u2019t even seem to realize his feelings over this is an issue. Also, maybe focus less on \u201ccoaching him\u201d for getting you gifts, and focus on what you can do for him.

Your intent pales in comparison to the impact, and I can promise you you hurt him with your lack of effort.\n\nIf you love your husband and value your marriage, you'll quit this boorish defensive stance and start listening to what he's telling you.", "Yta.

I laughed out loud when I read the part where she said she has to coach him for what gifts to give her, but then she forgot Father\u2019s Day AND his birthday. Sounds like she is a little (lot) self centered. You can see where her priorities are, and it\u2019s clearly not her husband.", "Why are you posting the same comment again and again?? I agree with the comment but WHY", "There *are* N T As???", "im betting he has lots of regrets, either she pulled the bait and switch on him, or he was dumb to marry a woman who is so self centered.", "Well given how insufferable OP sounds, I'm sure her husband would be very happy when he doesn't have to deal with her bs.", "> I... don't know how to vote here.\n\nFlip the genders, and I doubt you'd have any issues in deciding how to vote.", "I can hear this conversation honestly. For years I was a superb gift giver or good at being very thoughtful. My husband wasn't. I stopped putting as much effort into it because HE was signaling to me that it wasn't important because he didn't treat my important days the same. \n\nSo if he decided that he was going to suddenly do better in a way to correct my behavior okay that's one thing. But to tell me about it. On mothers day.  I would be very upset and yes defensive. But I don't claim to have a great marriage lol", "I agree here. I need to know what OP\u2019s gift giving history was prior to this last year. Because husband only threw last year in her face, not years worth of her not remembering. \n\nAnd I also don\u2019t really care for the idea that he held onto that feeling until Mother\u2019s Day to bring it up. Does anybody talk to their partner anymore??  \n\nThey both communicated poorly. I don\u2019t know who to side with here.", "If you have a partner, the implication is that they think enough of you to do something for you. Kind of like instead of saying \"I love you\" you show the \"I love you\" part.", "I fail to see how this is even aggressive though.  She started the whole thing with \"I'm surprised you actually stepped up for once\"\n\nCalling out her BS hypocritical behavior at that point isn't aggressive, its self defense.", "she opened the door with the dig about being surprised he did so much for mothers day. Guessing he just kept all this stuff in, bc princess would get defensive (like he predicted and she did), when he brought it up. As a man you should do a better job picking who you are going to commit to and have children with.", "He gave her everything she wanted for mother's Day and didn't say a word to her about anything until after she so callously expressed surprise that he did a good job, so he defended himself, then she lied about doing a good job giving him his bday gift and he immediately called her out for buying it the day of....I don't see where the husband sucks on any of this", "It\u2019s mean to point out when she lies to him?\n\nCut me a break", "Why? I remember what we did for fathers day last year", "The point was to point out that she didn\u2019t do *anything* for him. He tried to make her days special\u2014she just has excuses for why she didn\u2019t", "You're really coddling her", "Well yeah its hard when your 12.", "I reschedule holidays all the time. It\u2019s not that hard to say to the honoree \u201cI have to be out of town X Date, but let\u2019s do something special for Holiday the weekend before/after.\u201d They know you didn\u2019t forget, you still do something to celebrate them, and whatever needs to get taken care of gets taken care of.", "lol then she would have to order it sooner than the DAY OF \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", " I can see why he is disappointed, and that's definitely on you.", "Thats exactly what half assing a gift means", "Waiting to order until the day of his birthday IS half assing it. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to go to a real store, or think ahead by TWO DAYS since she ordered off Amazon. OP is the AH.", "Can confirm. As a married man who's both been on the giving and receiving end of bad gifts.", "I had some weird error message and the post seemingly wasn't posted. I copied the post and tried to post it again a couple of times until it worked. But apparently it was posted every time, although it never showed any action when I pressed \"post\". Didn't even notice that there are so many posts now.", "In their defense Reddit has been acting up (at least for me) today so I can see it being an accident", "OP really does a terrible job explaining exactly why her husband is bad at gift giving, in fact it sounds like she is just far to picky and self absorbed to actually appreciate his efforts.", "Yeah, and you should respect them all year not act like an entitled brat asking for presents. Isn't it better to randomly get flowers on a Tuesday than set your hopes high to have some magical experience just bc the calendar says so? I get gifts for Mother's Day but to be honest I'd rather not and every year I tell people not to.", "That's not what I meant, although I am not sure I would define hers as a lie, more like a poor excuse. Basically what I meant is that I don't believe in a relationship you should make someone guilty because they remember of something last minut, life can be really hard sometimes and it's moreoften a lack of attention due to low energy than the will to lie. Despite this tho, I still think she is not showing her husband care and is disregarding his needs, that being said doesn't mean that vomiting on each other the resentment you have is right. \nGenerally speaking she is showing a lack of attention towards her husband and disregard his feeligs, but at the same time I believe that recriminating things is not really the way to heal a relationship.\n\nI am sorry if I can't make myself clear, it's difficult to express complex concepts in english and be sure I can make myself understood.", "That\u2019s what we are doing for Father\u2019s Day this year. My kid and I are at scout camp so Father\u2019s Day is the following weekend in our family. It\u2019s no big deal as long as you talk about it ahead of time.", "Even half assed gifts are usually ordered before they are supposed to arrive. Calling that half assing is a bit generous in my opinion", "No i meant half assing means you get them a gift on time. But like something from a gas station or something like that.", "If that's how you want to feel loved then sure, but not everyone is you.", "Saying the gift was delivered late, which carries a heavy implication that the delay was out of OP's hands is a lie when it wasn't even ordered until the birthday.", "That\u2019s not half adding then. The whole point of a gift is to let the other person know you were thinking about them prior to their birthday. Getting a gift on the way to their house, or ordering day of, is not half assing, it\u2019s just flat out forgetting about them.", "If you put it this way, I agree. When I read of delayed stuff o late gitf I have a soft spot as my bf has adhd and he sometimes forget to do stuff, so I am used to have a reason for certain things. Probably was just projecting"]}
