Yesterday was Mother's day and my husband is notoriously bad at gift-giving and that sort of thing.  I have rather specific taste so I pretty much have to coach him on what I want for birthdays, Xmas, anniversary, etc.  But to my surprise, yesterday he actually did a pretty good job.  He had the kids all make me hand-made cards, made me breakfast in bed, and took the kids out of the house for the afternoon so I could get a mani-pedi and relax, and got me a nice bottle of wine with some fancy cheese and chocolate.  \n\nLast night after the kids went to bed, I thanked him for a great day and expressed how surprised I was that he actually stepped up.  He told me I deserve it, but also said that he hopes that I can do something similar for him for Father's day this year.  I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he asked me if I remember what I did for Father's day last year, but I couldn't remember.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I did nothing for him for Father's day last year.  Then I remembered that for Father's day last year I was at my sister's wedding.  My younger sister had a small, out-of-state, childfree wedding last June, which happened to be on Father's day weekend.  I was the Maid of Honor and since our kids couldn't come, my husband stayed home with them while I was gone from Thursday-Sunday.  \n\nI had every intention of still doing something for him for Father's day, but I must have completely forgotten and he never brought it up to me.  So I felt a little blindsided and put on the spot when he asked me to remember what I did.  \n\nI told him that I'm sorry I forgot to do anything for him last year, but that I don't appreciate being put on the spot like that.  I also don't appreciate the implication that I purposely forgot or did nothing for him on purpose.  I had a lot of things going on at that time last year and I fully admit that I spaced it out and completely forgot.  That's my fault and I accept it, but don't rub my face in it.  \n\nI asked him why he didn't just bring it up to me and he said it's not his responsibility to remind me about that sort of thing.  He said he didn't bring it up because he figured I would just get defensive about it and try to make excuses, exactly like I was doing right then.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I also \"forgot\" to get him anything for his birthday last year.  I told him that I didn't forget, his gift was just delivered late.  He then told me that he has access to our Prime account too and he saw that I didn't even order it until the day of his birthday.  \n\nI told him he was being a jerk and ruining what was up until then, a perfectly good Mother's day.  He said he' not trying to be a jerk, he's just letting me know that he needs to feel that there is some reciprocation for these kind of things.\n\nNow I feel like he only stepped up so he could rub it in my face that I didn't do anything for him last year.", "created_utc": 1684165479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ibuq2/aita_for_forgetting_what_i_did_for_my_husband_for/", "score": 3462, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound really self-absorbed.", "YTA - and its hilarious you would think otherwise.  You expect him to step up because you have \"specific taste\" but you don't even put forth the minimum.  Perhaps he isn't even a bad gift giver, perhaps you're just an overly picky woman.  And then you get mad because he calls you out?\n\nAlso, he gives you a great day, and your first response is telling him you are surprised he did a good job, when you did NOTHING.  \n\nI can only imagine the comments if you were the husband and not the wife.", "YTA.

It sounds as though neither of you really have that down pat. \ud83d\ude14", "ESH\u2014you for calling him a terrible gift giver when you couldn't even remember to get him gifts.\n\nand him for ruining your mother's day. there's a time and place for convos. he basically ruined his gift by making it about himself. he could've brought it up literally the next day. but no, he had to give such a good gift just to rub it in your face that you didn't. seems pretty selfish to me.", "I'm gonna go with ESH on this one. Your husband should have picked another time (ideally, in the past) to bring this up - bringing it up on the evening of Mother's Day is passive aggressive and an AH move. That being said, I totally understand being upset that you, his wife, didn't get him anything for Father's Day and waited until the day of his birthday to order him a gift. That's pretty weak and if he did the same to you, we'd probably be calling him an AH.

Yesterday was Mother's day and my husband is notoriously bad at gift-giving and that sort of thing.  I have rather specific taste so I pretty much have to coach him on what I want for birthdays, Xmas, anniversary, etc.  But to my surprise, yesterday he actually did a pretty good job.  He had the kids all make me hand-made cards, made me breakfast in bed, and took the kids out of the house for the afternoon so I could get a mani-pedi and relax, and got me a nice bottle of wine with some fancy cheese and chocolate.  \n\nLast night after the kids went to bed, I thanked him for a great day and expressed how surprised I was that he actually stepped up.  He told me I deserve it, but also said that he hopes that I can do something similar for him for Father's day this year.  I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he asked me if I remember what I did for Father's day last year, but I couldn't remember.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I did nothing for him for Father's day last year.  Then I remembered that for Father's day last year I was at my sister's wedding.  My younger sister had a small, out-of-state, childfree wedding last June, which happened to be on Father's day weekend.  I was the Maid of Honor and since our kids couldn't come, my husband stayed home with them while I was gone from Thursday-Sunday.  \n\nI had every intention of still doing something for him for Father's day, but I must have completely forgotten and he never brought it up to me.  So I felt a little blindsided and put on the spot when he asked me to remember what I did.  \n\nI told him that I'm sorry I forgot to do anything for him last year, but that I don't appreciate being put on the spot like that.  I also don't appreciate the implication that I purposely forgot or did nothing for him on purpose.  I had a lot of things going on at that time last year and I fully admit that I spaced it out and completely forgot.  That's my fault and I accept it, but don't rub my face in it.  \n\nI asked him why he didn't just bring it up to me and he said it's not his responsibility to remind me about that sort of thing.  He said he didn't bring it up because he figured I would just get defensive about it and try to make excuses, exactly like I was doing right then.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I also \"forgot\" to get him anything for his birthday last year.  I told him that I didn't forget, his gift was just delivered late.  He then told me that he has access to our Prime account too and he saw that I didn't even order it until the day of his birthday.  \n\nI told him he was being a jerk and ruining what was up until then, a perfectly good Mother's day.  He said he' not trying to be a jerk, he's just letting me know that he needs to feel that there is some reciprocation for these kind of things.\n\nNow I feel like he only stepped up so he could rub it in my face that I didn't do anything for him last year.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My birthday actually fell on Mother's Day this year; my wife took me to lunch and a movie Saturday so we didn't have to 'Share the Day'.  And yesterday I got her some flowers and a bunch of her favorite treats to snack on all day, and took the kids out for a few hours so she could have some alone time.

I almost guarantee he was hoping for some sort of gift, or at the very least recognition, when you returned to town. \n\nThe fact he remembered it for this long tells you everything you need to know. Your husband might not resent you in a traditional way because of this, but the fact that you don\u2019t even seem to realize his feelings over this is an issue. Also, maybe focus less on \u201ccoaching him\u201d for getting you gifts, and focus on what you can do for him.

You need to do better and start matching his efforts.\n\nAnd just an FYI, it doesn't actually matter if you didn't do any of this on purpose. Your intent pales in comparison to the impact, and I can promise you you hurt him with your lack of effort.\n\nIf you love your husband and value your marriage, you'll quit this boorish defensive stance and start listening to what he's telling you.", "Yta.

Just hold your hands up, say sorry and tell him to wait and see what you have planned for Father\u2019s Day to make up for it.

To start off with saying your husband is a terrible gift giver just shows how inconsiderate you can be. Having to coach on what you specifically want takes the meaning out of the gift. He sees something and it makes him think of you. That is what should matter. \nFor mother's day, what he did was sweet. Was it ammo for last year.. possibly... Which isn't the correct way to go about it. But it seems like y'all are not on the same communication page. It's not hard to make sure he has a good holiday of any kind just like you. The fact that it slipped your mind after the wedding is absurd too because I know people around you talked about their Fathers Day gifts and Activities, so there should have been no reason not to do something for him. \nI think you should really think about who you are in this relationship and what you want to give and what will be given in return based on those actions.

In other words, I don't think this is doing more than lying to actually be gaslighting, even if I would say some level of deceit is necessary for gaslighting someone. It's a \"necessary but not sufficient\" situation.\n\n\nThough if you're looking for an example of trying to \"make someone question their own perspective (i.e. gaslighting) without some level of lying\", your own question would fit that bill (which reflects the issue with overly broad usages or vaguer definiitons)", "You can also archive orders right after you place them.

A wedding that happened to fall on one of those days would absolutely not be a big deal where I am from.

You cannot reasonably claim she didn't know that these two events coincide. \n\nShe could have planned a Father's Day before the wedding took place, but she chose not to do so. Additionally, she claimed she had forgotten. \n\nShe did not wish to celebrate Father's Day. Her behavior and actions are evidence of this. Furthermore, she claims she didn't purposely forget, which I find unlikely. \n\nTo make matters worst, she mentioned how surprised she was when he stepped up, which is a backhanded compliment. That's such a disrespectful thing to say to your partner. \n\n\nShe also ordered a gift a day before his birthday and argued it arrived late. Of course, it arrived late. It was a day prior.  Additionally, ordering a gift the day before your partner's birthday shows how little you appreciate and value them in a relationship. \n\nShe didn't place any special importance on his birthday or Father's Day. This much is evident and irrefutable. \n\nHe should expect reciprocation in return. There shouldn't be a competition of who can outdo the other - that is harmful and unhealthy. However, there should be an equal exchange. Honor, cherish, and respect your partner. \n\nShe also claims her boyfriend is notoriously bad at giving gifts, and yet, she lacks in this area as well. It comes across as ironic and lacking in awareness.", "Yikes, YTA. Your husband stepped up and did it major which you appreciated. \n\nForget all about the past and how you\u2019ve had to coach him on special days what your special tastes are, focus on the current special day.. which you flipped the script on him and came to Reddit to ask us if your the AH. \n\nHe was simply opening conversation about that subject and what he would like to see from you. The mere statement of him speaking about what you didn\u2019t do was not to rub it in your face, it was simply open conversation. You wanted closed communication hence why you\u2019ve came here instead of talking to him only.\n\nYou could have easily felt super ashamed and apologetic then said, \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry honey, I know I was not there for you on those special days and I understand how you feel because I have felt unnoticed before but today you really surprised me and made me feel appreciated\u201d.\n\nWho even has a wedding on Father\u2019s Day and makes it child free , knowing there could be plenty of fathers with families that had to miss out.

Do you have any idea how much anxiety that creates when you don't know what to get your partner. Help the man out. The month or two out start sending him little lengths to things that you like then he can go back and pick one of them later. This is the number one reason why people don't like holidays where there's gift-giving. People get judged and it develops anxiety which shuts their ability to be creative down. \n\nYour husband: he doesn't need to throw it in your face that you forgot. But you should really known better. I don't blame him for going over the top to kind of make you feel bad, I'd do the same thing.\n\nYour sister: what the H was she thinking.

It's not like he announced forgetting Father's Day and birthday gifts at a big family gathering embarrassing her in front of everyone.\" Being\" put on the spot\" and \"blindsided\" aren't terms to use for a private conversation with your spouse.
