Yesterday was Mother's day and my husband is notoriously bad at gift-giving and that sort of thing.  I have rather specific taste so I pretty much have to coach him on what I want for birthdays, Xmas, anniversary, etc.  But to my surprise, yesterday he actually did a pretty good job.  He had the kids all make me hand-made cards, made me breakfast in bed, and took the kids out of the house for the afternoon so I could get a mani-pedi and relax, and got me a nice bottle of wine with some fancy cheese and chocolate.  \n\nLast night after the kids went to bed, I thanked him for a great day and expressed how surprised I was that he actually stepped up.  He told me I deserve it, but also said that he hopes that I can do something similar for him for Father's day this year.  I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he asked me if I remember what I did for Father's day last year, but I couldn't remember.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I did nothing for him for Father's day last year.  Then I remembered that for Father's day last year I was at my sister's wedding.  My younger sister had a small, out-of-state, childfree wedding last June, which happened to be on Father's day weekend.  I was the Maid of Honor and since our kids couldn't come, my husband stayed home with them while I was gone from Thursday-Sunday.  \n\nI had every intention of still doing something for him for Father's day, but I must have completely forgotten and he never brought it up to me.  So I felt a little blindsided and put on the spot when he asked me to remember what I did.  \n\nI told him that I'm sorry I forgot to do anything for him last year, but that I don't appreciate being put on the spot like that.  I also don't appreciate the implication that I purposely forgot or did nothing for him on purpose.  I had a lot of things going on at that time last year and I fully admit that I spaced it out and completely forgot.  That's my fault and I accept it, but don't rub my face in it.  \n\nI asked him why he didn't just bring it up to me and he said it's not his responsibility to remind me about that sort of thing.  He said he didn't bring it up because he figured I would just get defensive about it and try to make excuses, exactly like I was doing right then.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I also \"forgot\" to get him anything for his birthday last year.  I told him that I didn't forget, his gift was just delivered late.  He then told me that he has access to our Prime account too and he saw that I didn't even order it until the day of his birthday.  \n\nI told him he was being a jerk and ruining what was up until then, a perfectly good Mother's day.  He said he' not trying to be a jerk, he's just letting me know that he needs to feel that there is some reciprocation for these kind of things.\n\nNow I feel like he only stepped up so he could rub it in my face that I didn't do anything for him last year.", "created_utc": 1684165479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ibuq2/aita_for_forgetting_what_i_did_for_my_husband_for/", "score": 1076, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yesterday was Mother's day and my husband is notoriously bad at gift-giving and that sort of thing.  I have rather specific taste so I pretty much have to coach him on what I want for birthdays, Xmas, anniversary, etc.  But to my surprise, yesterday he actually did a pretty good job.  He had the kids all make me hand-made cards, made me breakfast in bed, and took the kids out of the house for the afternoon so I could get a mani-pedi and relax, and got me a nice bottle of wine with some fancy cheese and chocolate.  \n\nLast night after the kids went to bed, I thanked him for a great day and expressed how surprised I was that he actually stepped up.  He told me I deserve it, but also said that he hopes that I can do something similar for him for Father's day this year.  I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he asked me if I remember what I did for Father's day last year, but I couldn't remember.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I did nothing for him for Father's day last year.  Then I remembered that for Father's day last year I was at my sister's wedding.  My younger sister had a small, out-of-state, childfree wedding last June, which happened to be on Father's day weekend.  I was the Maid of Honor and since our kids couldn't come, my husband stayed home with them while I was gone from Thursday-Sunday.  \n\nI had every intention of still doing something for him for Father's day, but I must have completely forgotten and he never brought it up to me.  So I felt a little blindsided and put on the spot when he asked me to remember what I did.  \n\nI told him that I'm sorry I forgot to do anything for him last year, but that I don't appreciate being put on the spot like that.  I also don't appreciate the implication that I purposely forgot or did nothing for him on purpose.  I had a lot of things going on at that time last year and I fully admit that I spaced it out and completely forgot.  That's my fault and I accept it, but don't rub my face in it.  \n\nI asked him why he didn't just bring it up to me and he said it's not his responsibility to remind me about that sort of thing.  He said he didn't bring it up because he figured I would just get defensive about it and try to make excuses, exactly like I was doing right then.  \n\nHe then reminded me that I also \"forgot\" to get him anything for his birthday last year.  I told him that I didn't forget, his gift was just delivered late.  He then told me that he has access to our Prime account too and he saw that I didn't even order it until the day of his birthday.  \n\nI told him he was being a jerk and ruining what was up until then, a perfectly good Mother's day.  He said he' not trying to be a jerk, he's just letting me know that he needs to feel that there is some reciprocation for these kind of things.\n\nNow I feel like he only stepped up so he could rub it in my face that I didn't do anything for him last year.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My birthday actually fell on Mother's Day this year; my wife took me to lunch and a movie Saturday so we didn't have to 'Share the Day'.  And yesterday I got her some flowers and a bunch of her favorite treats to snack on all day, and took the kids out for a few hours so she could have some alone time.

I almost guarantee he was hoping for some sort of gift, or at the very least recognition, when you returned to town. \n\nThe fact he remembered it for this long tells you everything you need to know. Your husband might not resent you in a traditional way because of this, but the fact that you don\u2019t even seem to realize his feelings over this is an issue. Also, maybe focus less on \u201ccoaching him\u201d for getting you gifts, and focus on what you can do for him.

You need to do better and start matching his efforts.\n\nAnd just an FYI, it doesn't actually matter if you didn't do any of this on purpose. Your intent pales in comparison to the impact, and I can promise you you hurt him with your lack of effort.\n\nIf you love your husband and value your marriage, you'll quit this boorish defensive stance and start listening to what he's telling you.", "Yta. He may be a terrible gift giver but at least that\u2019s something. You did nothing for his birthday and Father\u2019s Day.

He sees something and it makes him think of you. That is what should matter. \nFor mother's day, what he did was sweet. Was it ammo for last year.. possibly... Which isn't the correct way to go about it. But it seems like y'all are not on the same communication page. It's not hard to make sure he has a good holiday of any kind just like you. The fact that it slipped your mind after the wedding is absurd too because I know people around you talked about their Fathers Day gifts and Activities, so there should have been no reason not to do something for him. \nI think you should really think about who you are in this relationship and what you want to give and what will be given in return based on those actions.
