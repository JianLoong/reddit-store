It hurts and I spent so much time begging and pleading with him to try therapy or anything else first but he has it set in his mind that he can only be happy if we divorce so he \"doesn't continue hurting someone that loves him so much.\" \n\nWe are now almost 2 months into the separation and while I still feel the pain I feel like I'm also coping better whereas, based on what I can tell, he seems to be having it worse. Important to note is that I moved out and am now living with my best friend. This is only because he gave the ultimatum of either he goes or I go and if he had been the one to move out his plan was to sleep in his truck or in hotels. Meanwhile I knew if I left I would at least have a roof over my head. While I despise this situation I'm not cruel enough to make the father of my child (3)F homeless.\n\nOn to the issue, it turns out he had not told a single member of his family nor his friends the truth of our situation. Only saying we were having issues and that I had left. His grandparents babysit for us regularly and his grandmother had begun making comments about me leaving. Nothing overt but basically implying that I was the one leaving him in his \"time of need.\" (His mother passed back in June in a very traumatic way.) \n\nI asked him multiple times to correct this because I was bothered that the narrative had been spun that I left HIM. He always said he would but apparently never did. This past week she once again brought it up asking if I had changed my mind and \"reminding\" me I still had a husband at home and I finally snapped a bit. I told her the whole truth while breaking down crying. She apologized and comforted me and I left for school. \n\nHe called as I was driving angry, saying I had no right to tell them the truth because he didn't want their input or opinion on this. Meanwhile I told him it wasn't fair he's basically spun this narrative I'm the bad guy that wanted a divorce when he knew it was the very last thing I wanted. Now I feel conflicted, my friend says I did the right thing setting the story straight but apparently now many of his friends and family know the truth and are very upset with him. AITA?\n\nEdit to add: No he has not, nor would he ever have been cheating. I can promise all of you there is absolutely no other woman in his life. I just wanted to put that out there because I keep seeing a few comments saying it. I understand why you guys would think that, however that is the one area I can be 100% certain on. Also no he did not outright say I started everything just that I had left. However he never did anything to stop the idea as it spread from person to person. It started as a misunderstanding yes but he never corrected the misunderstanding.", "created_utc": 1668269606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytba1b/aita_for_being_honest_about_my_marital_situation/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband however is a huge one.  That's one of the most bizarre reasons that I've ever heard for divorcing someone.  He loves you so much and doesn't want to hurt you?  There's something else going on here.  Also not telling his family and letting you take the blame is cowardly.  I'm so glad that people know the truth and if he doesn't want their opinions he can ignore.  I'm sorry this is happening to you.", "NTA, he wants it both ways. He was the initiator of the break up but doesn\u2019t want to be seen as the bad guy. Tough. He needs to own his decisions and not try and hide like the little boy he is.", "Hell no, NTA. \n\nYou've begged and pleaded to try and work things out and even moved out of your home to accommodate him while he is lying to everyone and flipping the script to make everyone think you're the bad guy. He hurt you then shifted the blame and shamed you for it so he could feel better about himself. The truth needed to be told.", "NTA. Also, if you didn't want the divorce before, you should sure want it now. The fact that he is lying about your situation and trying to make you into a bad guy to your friends and family should tell you everything you need to know about this person. Get out of this situation, heal and move on with your life.", "NTA. That\u2019s what he gets for lying. Now he gets to deal with the fallout.", "NTA. You have every right to set the record straight. His friends and family are right to be upset with him.", "Oh, My Dear, in no way whatsoever are YOU to blame for this. He wants to have his cake and eat it too - not have the emotional responsibilities of working on the marriage while throwing you under the bus, making you out to be the bad guy.\n\nYou are NTA. I hope he can come out of the dark place he\u2019s in, but honestly, I\u2019d question whether he\u2019s worth returning to. What happens when another one of life\u2019s sorrows comes up and he emotionally runs off again? You know better what he\u2019s been through and whether you\u2019d be able to forgive him and move forward together, so maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. You are obviously a person who deserves to be in a solid and supportive marriage - you are trying your best to be in one right now even as he dismantles the whole thing while blaming it on you.\n\nBest of luck for your future. I am sure you will find happiness.", "NTA.  Wow.  I'd say be glad that your hubby will be your ex.  He has a need to be seen as \"the good guy\", it seems, to the point of lying to those around him about your situation.  My ex needed (and still needs) to always be the victim and can't stand anyone seeing her for who she really is.  She is a toxic narcissist.  Perhaps examine who your husband truly is and forget who you hope him to be.\n\nI would also suggest that you set the record straight with everyone in both families.  He opened this can of worms by painting a negative picture of you.  He deserves no protection, he made his choice so let him deal with the results.\n\n>I worry I may be the asshole because I know he's still taking his mother's death hard and all of this is most likely stemming from that. I don't want him to end up isolated because people are angry with him and considering it's his family not mine then maybe I should've kept calm and kept my mouth shut\n\nI just saw this and wanted to add:  I lost my mom a few months ago.  It's awful and it sucks and I'm still dealing with it.  It has not, however, changed fundamentally who I am as a person.  I haven't lied or deceived or misled anyone \"because I'm grieving for my mother\".  That's just a poor excuse for his behavior.", "NTA.  You have the right to tell the truth about your own life.  Always. No exceptions.", "Oh honey I\u2019m so sorry your & your little are going through this rough time.  Of course your NTA. \n\nHim & his friends can can get mad all they want, but this situation of him not telling the truth, is all on him. He\u2019s definitely TA here.", "NTA. You asked him to correct it and he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s a grown man, he can deal with the consequences of his actions. \n\nIs he in therapy? It seems like maybe he\u2019s having a hard time with the death of his mother. I suddenly lost my father when I was young and I became a bit self destructive afterwards. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to fix the marriage at this point, it may be worth trying to help him through whatever it is he\u2019s going through for the sake of your daughter.  \n\nBut anyways, you\u2019re definitely NTA for setting the record straight. It was shitty of him to put the blame on you.", "NTA.

First of all, if he didn\u2019t want you to tell them, he should have asked you not to tell them before it came up, not to just assume you could read his mind. Second, even if he did, you should not have to agree to something just because he is too weak to take the fallout of his own decisions. If he didn\u2019t want his family and friends and upset with him, perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have told his wife he wanted a divorce without even trying therapy. \n\nThis entire situation was not your choice. You have no obligation to uphold his lies or to protect his reputation. You do what you need to do for your own health and well being, and let his chips fall where they may.", "NTA this is of his own doing", "NTA. You are in a terrible situation and his lies made it worse for you.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like all of this was initiated by him by wanting to dissolve the marriage, but be seen publicly as the poor victim whose wife left him for unknown reasons.", "<<Only saying we were having issues and that I had left.>>\n\nThat could also just be taken as \"We were having issues and she's moved out\" which reflects the current housing situation. Maybe he wasn't comfortable going into more detail about it. People will sometimes draw their own incorrect conclusions when the information given is limited.\n\nNAH. Unless he said or implied to them somehow that the split was your decision entirely (??), then I say NAH. But you can just speak for yourself to anyone who is confused, not sure why you think he needs to officially \"set the story straight here\" when he may not have purposely done anything malicious.", "NTA  If he didn't want his family's input he needed to explain that to them, not make you the bad guy.\n\nHe can dislike the consequences of his actions, but that doesn't make them your fault.", "Oh bless you, you are such a good person but he is manipulating you. He made you move out with your child, what father does that? Then by not telling anyone he has been putting the blame on you. Please don't fall for any of his anger, crying or manipulation anymore. You have to be strong for your child and you deserve better. He is selfish. NTA.", "NTA. You told the truth and he intentionally allowed them to believe that you were the one who initiated the separation.\n\nHe\u2019s an adult and he can own the truth. He wants the divorce then he can be honest about wanting the divorce.", "NTA\n\nThis said, you moved out of the house with your child to protect him. He decided to break off the relationship and you still put him first.\n\nGiven the way he keeps on doing things that hurt you (in overt and covert ways) I have my doubts you are the person he doesn't want to keep on hurting. I think he's cheating on you.", "Whew. NTA. \n\nHe is obviously going through some terrible shit. A huge loss like that can cause people to have both terrible judgement and also big epiphanies about their life direction and desires. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re both experiencing this. \n\nBut you were very understandably honest in a situation where you were being unfairly painted as an asshole. \n\nSo you did the only thing you could do. Tell the truth.", "NTA. He doesnt get to be the one leaving and blame you when you wanted to try and fix things. He wanted an easy pass where no one would be disappointed in him", "You're NTA. His claim that you have no right to tell people the truth is insane. In reality,  he has no right to lie about you. If the family and friends are upset with him, too bad.

Your husband is playing games and using you as a pawn. He doesn't want to look like the bad guy not only with his family, but with you (i.e., telling you that he needs to divorce you because he loves you so much and doesn't want to cause you pain).\n\nAlso, cherchez la femme. Pretty sure he's having it off with someone else.", "Absolutely NTA. Like you said, he knows people will hate him for leaving you, and for letting you move out when he's the one who left you.

It's on him to seek support and manage and communicate what his needs are as related to his grief and relationship with you.", "NTA\n\nHe made his bed.", "NTA. This fella has you doubting yourself about something that was obviously okay for you to do. Don't put any more stock and what he thinks of your actions.  He is being selfish. And he's now your past. He doesn't matter anymore.", "His reasons were something along the lines of he actually doesn't love me like I deserve due to his mental health being so poor. He says he needs to be alone in order to work on himself and his mental state because he feels his issues are only dragging me down because he can't be the man he used to be. Meaning the man I initially fell in love with", "Can you try to persuade him to get help for his mental health? I lost a parent at a young age and I know how dark and depressing it can be. \n\nWhile I think he\u2019s acting like a jerk by making you take the blame for the separation, my heart does hurt for him because he\u2019s clearly lost and and having trouble finding his way.

Due to other things in his life I won't disclose here, his mental health has always been rocky at best. Over the past year there has been a more noticeable issue of him becoming more and more distant and angry to nearly everyone. I've taken the brunt of it obviously as the one living with him and I believe that's the \"dragging me down\" he's referring to. He says I'm too stubborn to leave on my own so he's doing it for me. I really feel like if he could get the help he needs then we could find a way through this.", "> I've taken the brunt of it obviously as the one living with him and I believe that's the \"dragging me down\" he's referring to. He says I'm too stubborn to leave on my own so he's doing it for me. \n\nSounds like he's manipulating you and projecting his own issues onto you. He's not leaving you because \"you're too stubborn\" and he's not \"doing this for you.\" He's too stubborn to try and work on himself and too stubborn to treat you well because he doesn't value you and he's doing all of this for him."]}
