No child needs to go on a diet unless they have diseases like diabetes or celiac in which they need a medical based diet. What these kiddos need is someone to teach them healthy eating habits! Replace the junk snacks with fresh fruits and veg. Have the family learn new healthy meals and cook together. They don\u2019t need a diet.", "NTA, they asked you for advice. You gave it. Your brother and SIL are free to reject it if they want.", "YTA they\u2019re teenagers - you aren\u2019t getting anywhere by reasserting an authoritarian vibe. Dieting instead of working on healthy lifestyles doesn\u2019t work either. It\u2019s a good thing you aren\u2019t a parent.", "ESH (except the kids) - You because your advice is terrible. 15 & 17 year old girls do not to be on a \"diet.\" They should not have snack foods completely banned because this could lead to an unhealthy relationship with food and/or an eating disorder.   \n\n\nSIL and brother suck because they haven't taught their children moderation and modeled/educated them on healthy eating habits. Being obese in your teens often leads to a life of obesity. As someone who was overweight as a child/teen and am now morbidly obese, I wish my parents had taught me better about moderation and instilled healthy eating habits at a young age.", "YTA. You are right that they need to start parenting. But diets are detrimental. There are mountains of studies over decades to prove it.", "NTA. Sometimes bandaids have to be ripped off. And if they're contributing to an actual epidemic, obesity, then they need to be told. How about being parents and looking out for the health of your kid. Sometimes they need to be told no. Who else to help them transition than a family member? Better than some stranger, like me, being the trigger.", "NTA - They asked your advice and you advised. If it\u2019s to the point that school nurses are saying something, it\u2019s understandable why you included that in your advice. You weren\u2019t harsh or rude, just made a suggestion to put the household on a diet, or at least limit all the snacks available. Children dieting is not ideal, but you were asked for suggestions and you said the obvious.", "NTA. Some people are just naturally big, others are unwell, and then there's the ones who are spoiled and selfish. It does make me chuckle a bit to think of your brother and sil with their earnest faces going \"How can this problem ever be solved!? It's a mystery!\" No, lads, just stop spoiling your kids.", "Children absolutely should not be dieting. YTA. There are bigger issue here with their parenting that need be addressed, but you became the asshole when you thought putting 2 teenage girls on a cold turkey diet was even remotely a good idea.", "YOU ARE THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE.", "INFO: please define diet based on how you described it.", "YTA.", "Nowhere in your post do you speak of loving your nieces or caring about their health. Muy triste \ud83d\ude41\n\nYour response was surgical. The ED they have can't be cut away. It's too bad you experience fatphobia to the point where you feel no tenderness for flesh and blood. \n\nYour advice in this cold manner makes YTA.", "ESH\n\nI am not a fan of children dieting.  Children don't need to diet, they need to exercise.  Now I completely agree they don't need a ton of junk food and limiting junk would be a great idea.  But healthy snacks are a much different story.  Fruit and yogurt, it doesn't even matter if the calories are high, as long as it isn't crap.\n\nBut exercise is really the best way to handle kids weight.  The girls are old enough you could take them to a gym, they could begin going as a family.  I wouldn't be to picky about what the girls decided to do, swimming would be ideal or some sport.\n\nAnd yeah mom and dad need to grow up.  Stop letting the kids rule the house, demand chores get done or they lose things.  Right now I take my kids clothes away if they do not wash them themselves.  If I wash the clothes they are mine.  They can earn them back, but they must do extra chores.", "NTA but if a 17 year old doesn't see them as an authority by now, I don't think she's going to start.", "NTA.\n\nThe kids need chores.\n\nThey also need to have meals rather than tank up on snacks. You are not wrong. Snacks are nutrient deficient and usually kids eat more because they aren't getting the nutrients they need.\n\nTell them to limit the amount of snacks they purchase. When the snacks are gone, they don't buy more until the next week. So, a bag of oreos for the family. When they are gone they are gone.\n\nDon't buy soda - if the girls want it, they purchase it.", "NTA- you were asked for advice, it wasn\u2019t unsolicited\n\nSounds like the girls need to see a registered dietitian and not pick some random yo-yo diet that we just end up making them gain more weight when the diet fails", "NTA. The sooner they address thid sooner they can grow. A diet doesn't have to mean starvation. Nor does it mean nothing good ever again. But constant snacking on calorically dense junk food needs to go. \n\nYou and the nurse were the wake-up call they needed.", "YTA. I was with you until you mentioned a diet. Yes, they should take what the doctor and nurse said seriously, but they should not do a diet. Diet eating is really bad, and just going cold turkey will lead to worse disordered eating. The parents need to work with a nutritionist to handle it properly. It's completely shameful that you even suggested it.", "YTA! Obese or not, never ever say what you said to the parents.\n\nAsking teenagers to quit something cold turkey is not the way to go. That was just bad advice. \n\nObviously they are appalled.  I would be too if you gave me this advice.", "Not at all mate, we need more of this - not all heroes wear capes ;)", "Man you got all the reddit fats made at you. You are not the ahole my dude.", "NTA but maybe don't frame it as a 'diet'. That word conjures up all sorts of negative images, sometimes for good reason. This should be about long term change of lifestyle where unhealthy-as-the-norm is replaced by tasty, tempting and nutricious meals that ultimately they will find more enjoyable and satisfying. It's going to be a hard road but the sooner they start, the better.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of the advice you gave, OP, you were asked to give it.  And it seems you did so in a polite manner.  Aces in my book.\n\nPeople may question the advice itself but, quite frankly, I would have said just about the same thing.", "NTA\n\nSo basically your brother and SIL let their kids walk all over them, and now don\u2019t know how to change that.\n\nThey asked if you had any advice, and you gave it to them.\n\nDo I think your advice wasn\u2019t particularly helpful? Yes. Do I think it makes you an asshole? Nope.\n\n(I just think it\u2019s unhelpful because the problem is with the parents not doing anything, and this looking for advice - particularly from non parents - is just more stalling that gives them the feeling they are doing something.)\n\nAnd no one is going to be miserable on a healthy diet, because a healthy diet and a healthy relationship with food doesn\u2019t classify any food as \u201cbad\u201d that needs to be avoided.\n\nI also wonder WHY the girls are snacking so much - boredom? Emotional comfort? Unable to recognize that they are no longer growing and their appetites don\u2019t need to grow? Without answering that (and addressing it) changing eating habits long term is going to be difficult, and while suggestions like yours might work in the short term, once a kid has their own money they will buy their own snacks.\n\nBut I do think your brother and SIL have been assholes to their kids by being doormats. Just because it wasn\u2019t malicious doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t hurt their kids.", "brother & SIL need to put their foot down. chores and diets are the way to go. they gotta take control or else those girls will run them over forever. not an asshole, just a concerned brother trying to help out.", "YTA\n\nDiets don't work. What you are suggesting is going to create a bigger risk of disordered eating. While you can acknowledge that the doctor has said is likely true, I would have suggested that the kids meet with a licenced dietitian to get proper advice. \n\nWhat you spewed is fatphobic and innapropriate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
