Make sure that your pay is deposited where only you can access it. Your mother is acting incredibly entitled. I'm not impressed with her turning on the waterworks and getting your grandmother involved. She's the parent, it's time she acts like it.", "NTA. Also, as you ARE 18 now, pull all the money from your current joint bank account and open an account only in your name. If she can't access the money, there will be no problem with her taking your money and then taking forever to return it.", "NTA.\n\nGo to your bank NOW and set up a new account in your name only. Better yet, go to a different bank where your mother doesn't have an account and set up a new account.  Put everything you have in that account and do not give your mother any more money.  Do not give her access to your information at all.  If necessary, set up online statements only and do not let your mother know.  Choose passwords she isn't likely to guess, and put as much security on your account (such as a secondary verification, PIN number, etc) to make it harder for anyone to access your account.  Also, do not use the \"remember me\" feature to log in - enter your username and password every time.\n\nDo not use a phone app for banking.  It's easy to hack in, and if you leave your phone where your mother can go through it, she will do her best to figure out how to access your account, especially if you have selected the \"remember me\" feature to log in.\n\nYour mother is stealing from you.  She has no right to take your money under any circumstances, or to tell you how to spend it.  And you aren't obligated to offer her any money.  That money is for your education.  Yes, it's nice to be able to help your family whenever possible, but it's also your parents' responsibility to provide for you.  Economic hardship is no excuse to take any of your money.", "GET YOUR OWN ACCOUNT. What is wrong with you? This woman is robbing you blind! And if you don't do something about it, then you deserve it. How much financial abuse do you need to see before you do something about it??", "NTA.  The people who gifted you money did so because they wanted *you* to have it, not your mother. You're old enough to open your own bank account. Close any account your mother has access to and continue to say no when she asks for money.

It's fine to help her but not for her to guilt you.", "NTA open your own account now. Start saving money. Your mom isn\u2019t entitled to your money.", "NTA. I'm sorry your mom has put you in this position with the guilt tripping and honestly the money stealing. I get that she's a single mom, but you've been trying to help out and pay for things yourself. I would get a bank account in your name and transfer all the money you have to a private account. If you feel like you want to help out, that's great. If you don't, she should NOT have access to your money or you may be going to college with nothing.", "NTA. You're an adult, even if freshly minted. That money, every last pretty red penny is yours. She has no right to it. You have no obligation to give it to her. Now, if you had a job and an agreement to pay a portion of each cheque into the household funds, that's a different story. This is gift money. The only thing I agree with is her suggestion to keep it to partially fund college. Otherwise, sounds like she's manipulating you.", "NTA, you should open an account separate from hers. The idea of sharing amongst the group is a sweet sentiment but can be taken too far easily. You should have things that are just your own. And if I gave someone money for their Graduation I would hope it would go towards their expenses not their families expenses.", "NTA.  Open up a bank account in a bank other than hers.   Your sister is the golden child.  Accept it.", "NTA. It's YOUR grad money, and you have every right to decide how to spend it. Your mom has no right to take it without asking, especially when she already said it was for college. And now she's guilt-tripping you into giving it to her? That's not fair. You're not being selfish for wanting to keep your own money, especially since you're saving it for college. Your mom needs to respect your boundaries and stop using your money without permission. On a side note, i found it odd that you mentioned the nail polish among the stuff you paid for.. is there some weird tradition that I am not aware of involving graduations and expensive nail polish?", "Nta your mom is disgustingly entitled.\n\nYou should get your own bank account TODAY.

Not your responsibility. \nIf your mom is manipulative and using guilt, it makes me think that she isnt acting out of desperation but out of selfishness and jealousy and greed.
