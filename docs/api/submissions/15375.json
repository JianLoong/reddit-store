I'm not defending that position, just making sure you know it's there and very real.\n\nWomen are taught at a very early age that their \"perfect man\" will get down on one knee and propose. Further more, society historically has maintained that if you've been in a hetero, monogamous, happy and fulfilling relationship for X amount of years (currently maybe 2-3?) and then man hasn't proposed, then what's wrong with the woman? What's wrong with her? Why doesn't he want to marry her? Not to mention all the bullshit harassment from older generations about free milk, old maids, failures at life, the comments- I mean verbal abuse- can be relentless. Most women who want marriage, who have been in the above relationships for said amount of time, have every right to ask where the relationship is headed.

Just be a good partner and give your significant other what they want to make them happy. If you really love someone, their happiness is more important than yours.", "> \u201ci don\u2019t believe the man needs to propose, why don\u2019t you propose?\u201d\n\nIs the girlfriend a small child?\n\nIs she unaware you can do that?", "He sees that she's in a rush to get married, he says that in the OP.\n\nSo? He isn't. Just because he knows she wants him to do something doesn't mean he has to do it, especially when she's not even willing to do what she's asking him to do.", ">He is the one controlling the scenario. \n\nThat's insane to suggest. He's not trying to get her to do anything. She's pressuring him. \n\n> He knows she wants a traditional proposal (where is the crime in that?) I don't think he wants to be engaged at all and has found a way to avoid it. \n\nLmao, \"not giving her what she wants\" isn't being controlling.\n\nIf she wants to be married, she can propose. He's made clear he'd accept.", "Sure I do, the vast majority of women aren't controlling.\n\nJust OP's girlfriend. That's just what is happening.\n\nHe's right. Her preference isn't more important than his. He has autonomy. The only thing sexist is the girlfriend's backwards beliefs.", "Yes, OP needs some empathy assistance. The comments arguing about it are super hard for me to understand from OPs viewpoint as OP seems incapable of empathy. Its super weird.", "It's silly.\n\nAll you point out is the girlfriend wants something... and as he pointed out above, he doesn't particularly care about getting married right now. Which you say as if you somehow deduced it, rather than it being a thing he told us, lol.\n\nThat's nothing. That's not an asshole move. That's two people with different desires. Throwing in \"Well she might not wait!\" is also pointless. I mean, yeah, maybe they break up, someone breaking up with you because you have different desires doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nSo... what then? Nothing.", "I think it's more than that though. She's saying \"I want to get married!\" He's saying \"engagement isn't a big priority to me\", \"I don't see us getting engaged anywhere in the near future\", but also...\"if you buy me a ring, sure, I'd say yes.\"\n\nLike, I think part of the reason his girlfriend wants him to propose is not just because of possible outdated expectations and gender roles but because....she actually wants him to enthusiastically marry her! And I'm not getting any of that from him. Not even a \"I'm really excited for our future and I see that for us but I'm not ready right now for x, y, and z reasons\". There's none of that. He's messing with her and obviously does not care about her feelings at all. The way he talks about her in the post \"bitching and whining\", like this dude does not even respect her. And he has the audacity to talk about sexism. Yawn.", "This tradition still stands most places. Plus, a lot of rings were heirlooms, usually provided by the groom's family, maaaaybe by the bride's if they only had girls. The wedding itself, in addition to the ring, was usually split between the families depending on who had the venue, who was helping the newlyweds find a house or letting them stay at their place, etc. \n\nFrom what I've heard and seen, the average around the world seems to be bride's family: wedding and kid's stuff, groom's family: ring, housing after the wedding. Feels like that's the reason women usually expect a proposal and their parents are so involved with the wedding planning (traditionally they foot the bill,) and why there's so many in-law horror stories where the wife is the one being bullied- in a lot of past and present cultural traditions, the wife lives with or they're provided housing by the groom's family. \n\nThe idea that all this is paid for by the couple on their own is a fairly recent one, and mostly linked to people being older and more established before getting into relationships or married. They don't need family support in the same way early to mid twenties people did, nor do they do multi-generational family homes very much. Though I think it's more of a western thing to both assert independence and try to avoid interference and drama. \n\nSo some of these traditions are outdated intellectually, but honestly still persist in interpersonal expectations and hopes. Afabs are conditioned to hope for a ring and a person who chooses to be with them. \n\nThere's also the idea that the proposal is planned by one partner, and the wedding is mostly planned by the other- I don't think this dude wants to do either, he just wants to be a pillow princess and she gets to plan all the romantic milestones in their relationship by herself (and pay for them too.)\n\nGay people either discuss things beforehand and mutually decide who's proposing- usually just depends who wants to propose, because it's a fun and exciting thing to do for the partner they love, and who wants to be proposed to due to childhood hopes, etc,- but the real fun happens when they've agreed they're headed towards marriage and it becomes a race to see who can propose first because they both want to propose XD", "So you\u2019ll buy them for yourself but not the person who has been devoted to you for three years and wants a token to demonstrate that for the future forward? \n\nI hope she saves you the trouble and breaks up", "I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re choosing to misunderstand the post/what i\u2019m saying because you enjoy arguing with others, or if you genuinely just don\u2019t get it. you\u2019re so focused on fighting for equal gender roles in all these comments that you can\u2019t see that the OP doesn\u2019t actually give AF about gender roles. \n\nto be clear, I support equal gender roles. what I don\u2019t support is someone lying about caring about gender roles just to help them win a fight against their girlfriend. \n\neither way, no point in arguing any longer with someone who can\u2019t comprehend what I\u2019m saying. i\u2019ll just let the downvotes speak for themselves. have a great night!", "This right here.  When you love someone and want to spend you life with them, you WANT to make them happy, not get into a pissing match about who is right.  My husband has done so much for me that he probably didn\u2019t want to do but did because it would make me happy.  And I love doing to same for him.  And we both do that without sacrificing our core principles. If you think this is sexist, are you going to take on traditional female roles in the house?  If you are having kids, would you expect her to stay home with kids, or would you give up your career to be the stay at home dad?  Because saying you wouldn\u2019t is also sexist.  Are you going to cook and clean?  Take on the majority of the household duties (because even when two spouses work, the woman still does a greater share of household duties and childcare).  My guess is you already have some things you do that fall along the lines of traditional gender roles and you don\u2019t have a problem with that.  If you are so not ready to get married that you are not interested in proposing, why would you be ready if she proposed?  Seems to me that you two are not in the least bit compatible.", "So, if she proposes he\u2019ll take her last name and be the stay home parent if they have kids?  Doubt it.", "Where'd you read that OP bought the jewelry he wears?", "He thinks it's fine if she proposes.\n\nHe doesn't want to.\n\nIt's that simple. She wants him to do something that he does not want to do. Rather than deal with that like a healthy human being, because other people have autonomy, she's trying to control him like an asshole.\n\nI understand your argument. You're just objectively wrong.", ">Calling OP's girlfriend controlling 10 times for wanting a proposal a specific way is misogynist, because OP is doing this same thing (wanting to be proposed to a specific way)\n\nThat's not what's happening.\n\nHe isn't trying to force her to propose his way. He's fine whether she does or not. He's respecting her autonomy.\n\nBaseless accusations of misogyny are fucked up on so many levels.\n\n>It's not controlling to want your partner to propose a certain way and be upset that they refuse to do that, or call them a jerk and cry for it\n\nIt's literally trying to control him and get him to do as she wants.\n\nSomeone's not a jerk for not doing as you please, you're just a selfish asshole.\n\n>And again, to repeat what I literally fucking said above, wanting to be engaged but not wanting to propose means you don't actually want to be engaged. OP's girlfriend included.\n\nSo by your silly logic... OP is doing exactly what his girlfriend wants?\n\nDo you see how backwards you've gotten it?\n\nI don't know why you're repeating what you said. I responded to it. I explained why you were wrong. You stopped responding on that point, because the wrong thing you said was disproven."]}
