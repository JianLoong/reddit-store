I'm not defending that position, just making sure you know it's there and very real.\n\nWomen are taught at a very early age that their \"perfect man\" will get down on one knee and propose. Further more, society historically has maintained that if you've been in a hetero, monogamous, happy and fulfilling relationship for X amount of years (currently maybe 2-3?) and then man hasn't proposed, then what's wrong with the woman? What's wrong with her? Why doesn't he want to marry her? Not to mention all the bullshit harassment from older generations about free milk, old maids, failures at life, the comments- I mean verbal abuse- can be relentless. Most women who want marriage, who have been in the above relationships for said amount of time, have every right to ask where the relationship is headed.

She wants the moment.\n\n> It\u2019s just not a giant priority for me to propose to her now.  \n>  \n>I already made it clear I\u2019d say yes\n\nThose are two contradictory statements.  The first statement pretty much negates the second.  \nIt is hurtful to hear from your partner that getting engaged is not a priority when it\u2019s something important to you.", "So here is the thing.  If you want different things, break up.  But don't drag it out if you aren't compatible.", "I am sexist and regressive or you are cheap and wishy washy?", "Now I'm voting AITA. Mate. This is what your girlfriend \\*needs\\*. This is her preference from a relationship point of view.

A man deciding what a woman should and shouldn't want from a relationship.", "they\u2019ve had so many conversations about the proposal over the last months and he\u2019s never once mentioned a concern about gender roles and having the woman propose. he\u2019s just now randomly bringing it up once they get into an argument??? yeah okay lol \n\nif that was something he actually cared about, he would have brought it up with her before now", "Like it sounds like you think you're going to win a point by proving that she is being sexist and then some Judge is going to say \"Aha!\"  /u/Sensitive-Bat-4512 is correct, girlfriend you must change your behavior!\" and then your gf is going to be like \"Oh, you're totally right, what an AH I was!  I will change immediately!\"\n\nThat's just not how arguments work in relationships.  You don't win a relationship argument with facts and logic except in certain rare situations, because they're not actually about the facts and the logic.  In this case, she wants to be married ASAP and she wants a traditional proposal.  Those are feelings, not facts.  You have to figure out a way to honor her feelings and reach a solution together that fits with your own feelings, which seem to be that you do not want those things.  \n\nYou don't accomplish that by proving she's sexist and regressive, you do it by convincing her that your love is true and your commitment is total but that you aren't ready yet (and you need to get her and maybe yourself to understand WHY you're not ready yet) and perhaps you want a different kind of proposal and maybe even a different kind of relationship than she's expecting, but that you have a vision for your futures that she will be excited about too.\n\nIt should be the two of you against the problem, not each of you against each other.", "Why do people need to propose.  \n\nWhy don't you just set a date and shop for wedding bands together.", ">I would love to receive that gesture and would honestly prefer it if she does propose to me.\n\nWhy does your preference matter more than hers? \n\nWhy can't you do a mutual proposal so both of you get the experience of being at the receiving end of a proposal?\n\nWould you actually respect her preference if it were less about sex roles and more just her as an individual wanting to be proposed to?\n\nDo you actually WANT to get married to her, or is it just you're ok with it?", "It doesn't sound like he likes her that much and they aren't on the same page. He doesn't want to put in the effort. If you want the relationship to last, what's important to the other person is also important to you.", "My original question remains though, why are relationships supposed to 50/50 until we get to the wedding and engagement?

She wants you to propose to her. \n\nYour wishes mirror hers, I don't get how you don't get what she wants. Putting yourself in her shoes shouldn't be this hard, then. If I want an expensive gift for my birthday and if my boyfriend wants an expensive gift for his birthday, I'm not going to go to Reddit and say \"I don't understand why HE wants an expensive gift, while I want an expensive gift!\". It just makes no sense, if you both want the same thing. \n\nSo, the simplest conclusion is : you pretend to not understand what she wants and pretend you don't understand what she wants and when she wants it *just* because what she wants is sexist. You think it's a good look. You think people won't think that you're being wishy washy about wedding or cheap about the engagement ring.\n\nDon't pretend to be less smart than you are. Don't think people are too dumb to not see what you're doing.\n\nYou simply do not want to get married if you have to do the effort, but you have no qualms with going with the flow.

Because you mentioned it to her for the first time in this fight and threw it out as an aggressive response to her request of you. \n\nSo there are two options: 1) you do actually want this and in all of the time you've been dating and especially in all of the time she has been asking you to propose you've never mentioned it only to get angry at her about it seemingly out of nowhere, which is immature and not at all how adults communicate or 2) you said it in the heat of the moment and didn't really mean it to goad her, and now feel like you have to stick by it because \"I won't ask you but I'll say yes if you ask me\" is contradictory and absurd, which is also not at all how adults communicate.", "Have you always wanted to be proposed to?

Weddings, anniversaries, pregnancy, gender reveals, first birthday, mile stone birthdays, renewal vows etc.\n\nThis guy is cool with getting married and you know what his problem is why he isn't? He is focusing on his career to make money to get her the ring she wants. She doesn't want the $2000 from the store. She wants the one where the physical ring is saved from tons of paychecks. And guess what, if he proposes now with a ring he actually can afford, she'll be pissed anyways and user would judge him for getting her something she didn't want saying YTA, she communicated she wanted XYZ and you didn't buy it. \n\nYou know what happens after the expensive right? Expensive engagement, bridal shower, Bach parties, then the EXPENSIVE WEDDING. Either he puts out the money or he makes the money and she can wait. \n\nYou know what is actually sexist? Telling men they should endorse sexist ideas that make men bend to women's will in the wedding tradition, the entire focus is only on the bride, her dress, her guests, her venue, her father giving her away, her dance, getting HER the ring, making an arbitrary rule to save x amount of paychecks or else he don't love you booboo, getting her a diamond ring (thank you DeBeers for fucking is over). \n\nDon't we all agree weddings are a two person equal event? Having children and naming them are a two person equal event? But proposals only go to the woman, and in this case the mans desires have to be entirely shelved bc she wants something that he can't provide? @OP you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. \n\nFor context I am a straight female in my 30s in a long term relationship with a partner, and we mutually would marry each other. Just waiting for the money, the house and whoever proposes first will be a fun surprise to see. Am excited to do it myself honestly, but I am also curious to see what my bf will do in the future."]}
