Since he is a human being and we love him, we try to accommodate without letting him dictate.\n\nYour wife is right in that that the kids should not be getting special dinner, but you are right that they should not have to eat what they don't like.\n\nGoing forward, what about defining 'fallback foods', that if they don't like what is being served, they can always get? We make our normal food, and if possible, put aside for him (for example, we make pasta, and before putting Bolognese sauce, we keep some plain noodles for him to eat with just the tomato sauce). If this is not possible, like we make burgers, we make sure to have something he can put on his bun (vegetarian patty) and else, fallback food is butter toast, hardboiled egg, anything easy we can offer him without cooking him a special dinner.\n\nI mean, you guys love your kids, and want them to be well fed and grow strong and healthy, right? And no one, adult or child, should **have** to eat something they don't like?\n\nSurely your wife has foods she doesn't like?
