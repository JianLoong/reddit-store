{"id": 70, "submission_id": "yhq8ls", "title": "AITA for not paying for a competition trip?", "selftext": "I (30 female) am married to my husband Joey (34). We both have daughters from previous relationships. My daughters name is Hailey (10) and his daughters name is Jenna (11). \n\nBoth of our daughters are cheerleaders for different teams. We recently just had their competition where the winners of first and second place go to compete in Disney. I have been saving all year since Haileys team is really competitive. Joey didn\u2019t save for it because Jenna is on a smaller town team that\u2019s not very competitive. \n\nHaileys team unfortunately did not win their competition this year.  Jenna\u2019s team did win theirs. Hailey, my husband, and I were all proud of her and congratulated her. \n\nLater that night my husband asked me about finances for the Florida trip. We have always kept finances for the girls separate as I pay for Hailey and he pays for Jenna. \n\nI explain that since Haileys team didn\u2019t win I figured her and I could go do something instead with the money I saved for Florida. Hailey doesn\u2019t know this was my plan yet. \n\nMy husband thinks I\u2019m being selfish and an AH because Jenna\u2019s team did win and we should use that same money for her to go. I think Hailey could use a pick me up. I know people might ask about Jenna\u2019s mother and she is not able to help financially for Jenna to go. We have already spoken to her. Also if any of the girls on the team cannot go to florida then the team has to forfeit. The team might do some fundraising but the expense will be on the parents. \n\nAITA?\n\n**\n\nEdit to answer some questions: \n\n1. We can\u2019t make it a family trip because there\u2019s not enough money. I had saved enough for myself and 1/2 of Haileys trip. Haileys father was paying the other 1/2 of her trip. \n\n2. My husband doesn\u2019t believe in loans when it comes to family. \n\n\n3. I did see some people ask how Hailey would feel about it. Hailey knows her dad and I save this money for her every year - her dad and I go without some luxuries for a while and she sees the sacrifices we go through. I don\u2019t ever regret it. However, I won\u2019t ask her to use that money for her step sister because she shouldn\u2019t have to get in the middle. \n\n4. My ex thinks we should do something nice for our daughter - either a small trip, a fun outing, or new clothes or shoes, etc. - just something fun and then use the rest for the next cheer season or for her next big expenses.\n\nUpdate: \n\nTonight my husband and I had another disagreement about the money. I did call my ex because I didn\u2019t want Hailey to over hear any of the argument and we decided it\u2019ll be best for her to spend the week with him. I\u2019m going to go stay at my parents house for a couple days. \n\nAs of right now my husband has been calling and sending numerous texts calling me the AH and selfish. I\u2019m currently ignoring it. \n\nWhen I dropped off Hailey to my ex we did talk about how Hailey will be needing braces a long time. She currently has her first set and will be getting a second set in the future. So we have decided to talk about putting that money towards Invisalign if she wants that instead in high school.", "created_utc": 1667164691, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhq8ls/aita_for_not_paying_for_a_competition_trip/", "score": 7451, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You planned, he didn\u2019t. There are other ways to come up with the money, borrow, fundraiser, sell some stuff, work extra hours, etc.\n\nEdited my vote after the reply. He\u2019s acting pretty entitled to just expect you to gift the money you saved for your daughter to his. He can find another way to fund it. Enjoy doing something nice with your daughter. Maybe he should have saved to because if her team had lost he would have had something saved for a nice outing as consolation as well.", "NTA.  Everyone seems to be glossing over the fact that you keep separate finances, AND Joey wasn't planning on paying ANYTHING for your daughter if she won.  He should've been saving just like you were.  She has two biological parents.  THEY are responsible for paying for their child, not you.", "NTA\n\nMy parents split all costs for my brother and myself 50/50. My step-dad covered our household with my mom, but things like braces and whatnot, my mom and bio dad handled.\n\nI love my step-dad. In fact, I call him Dad and my bio dad by his name when referring to him (still dad too, because he is, but he's not often there and he knows it and is okay).\nMoney wasn't a deciding factor for me in loving my Dad as my dad. He contributed to the household, attended my events when work allowed, helped me with homework, watched movies with us at night. He was a DAD. Money contribution didn't change that.\n\nAnd here's the thing - my step-dad grew up wealthy. He has a job that pays more than my bio dad or mom make (sometimes more than both combined). I've never once resented him for not jumping in to cover the things.\n\nNow, because of the lack of an ex on his part, yes, when extra funds have been available, he would pay for things my bio dad should have paid half for. School clothes, books, sports items (cleats needing to be replaced, etc). That was when funds allowed and it was urgent.\n\nBut he respected the agreement my bio parents had. He never wanted to cut my bio dad out, never wanted to interfere. So he did what he could, but never to the detriment of my relationship with bio dad.\n\nAnd you know what? I grew up knowing it was okay to not get everything. I, too, did cheer. There were certain things we could not afford between my bio parents. It was fine. That's literally life. My step-dad could have paid, and knowing him, he secretly offered but my mom wanted to be fair to the agreement as well. I believe she was right to do that. I never once felt disconnected from bio dad and bio dad never felt competition from my step-dad. That was healthy.\n\nI'm now 30 and my dads (bio and step) get along so well. They're both grateful for each other. They literally tell each other that. My bio knows that step never tried to interfere and often had his hands tied by situations. My step knows bio had to handle a contentious relationship with mom and was shut out sometimes from there. Mom knows they both tried as much as they could.\n\nI'm happy. I have 3 amazing parents. Their money never defined my happiness.\n\nAlso, I got step when I was 8 years old. So we went through all of the teen things. All of the costs and drama and emotions. I'm surprised they survived me, but I love them all so much.\n\nNTA one million percent. Parents are more than ATMs and what your provide your step kid emotionally and by being there is far more important.", "NTA, what would he have done if both teams were selected to go? Expect you to pay for both?", "Info- because someone else asked and I was curious. Ask him if both girls had won, what was his plan, was he going to accept that his daughter couldn't go because he did no saving, or would he expect you to not let Hailey go because that wouldn't be fair to Jenna?", "Edit:  My comment was made prior to all of the edits/responses from OP.  Based on the updates, changing to NTA.  \n\nI feel like this is a tough one - and a lot of the context that would drive a good answer to this is missing.\n\nOn one hand, this sounds like a simple not the asshole.  You prepared - he did not.  That's not your fault.  \n\nBut - the way you explain it - it was 100% reasonable he did not prepare.  It did not sound like either of you expected them to win and make it to Disney - so it's 100% reasonable not saving up for it.\n\nI'm going to go with N.A.H - because I see both perspectives.  Being in a family is to some extent, about a give and take situation.  If Jenna isn't able to go because there is no money - at the same time you & Hailey still do a trip to Florida - you are going to end up spending more money on therapy then the trip cost in the first place.\n\nIs there some compromise?  Can he save up some of the money, and you loan him the rest, which he pays back over the next X time period?  Then you & Hailey can take a trip?  That would be less timebound than the competition.  \n\nNow, if the husband is out wasting his money on partying/drinking/video games/buying shit, that's another situation.    But there is nothing in your post that screams \"shitty husband that wastes money\".  Rather, a situation you weren't expecting, occurred, and no one is at fault for the lack of savings.", "When you say your husband doesn\u2019t believe in loans between family \n\nYour daughter is not family to him.

Hubby wanted separate finances for the girls, so unfortunately that\u2019s his problem to figure out for his daughter. One could argue that he should be saving some money monthly to pay for anything unexpected. OP said she went without certain things to save for this trip. Why is hubby\u2019s poor planning OP\u2019s problem?  OP has also stated in some comments that hubby hasn\u2019t helped with surprised medical costs for Hailey (surgery/braces) in the past so why should OP all of a sudden be expected to pay for Jenna when he hasn\u2019t helped towards Hailey?\n\nAlso, why does everyone seem to think that OP is going to take her daughter on some fancy trip with the savings? OP didn\u2019t say anything about trip to Florida, she\u2019s said a small trip, which would have probably been an night in a hotel in the closest city they live too while hubby and Jenna have gone to the competition.", "NTA \n\nHe should have been saving his money just like you did.

If she doesn't care about her step-daughter's feelings towards her, fine, this won't be a hard choice...  if she DOES care, if she wants the daughters to have a respectful relationship, it's going to be a much more difficult choice.\n\nIf the father is able to afford to save up money, he should have offered to pay OP back for the money he needs for his daughter's trip (he might just not have thought about it, so this is something OP could suggest).  If he can't pay her back based on his current financial situation, he needs to sit down and look at what he might be able to do to make it possible.  Are there things he can give up?  Is it time he start applying for other jobs that would pay more? Are there chances for fundraisers?

The fact remains that the dad CHOSE not to save based on an ASSUMPTION that Jenna's team wouldn't win, which again isn't OP's fault but it was dad's responsibility. That has now bit him in the ass because when you fail to plan, you plan to fail. NTA\n\nI agree that taking Hailey on a trip if Jenna can't go on hers could lead to a lot of resentment. So maybe the money should just be put into Hailey's college fund or it could be used for any upcoming school expenses (dances or other sports Hailey participates in the OP would have to come out of pocket for).\n\nWe don't know if they've ever had a situation like this before or if this is a one off. But to avoid situations like this in the future, there needs to be better communication between the parents. OP's husband should have known the saved money was earmarked for Hailey regardless of the competition outcome (since a consolation trip was always planned by OP). They should also have had a plan for if both girls' teams moved on to the competition, regardless of how unlikely that may have been.

It was his wife who saved it for her daughter, he had no part whatsoever, he didn't chip in for stepdaughter's eventual trip, nothing, nada. And now, he is just expecting to get that money he did nothing to save to go for his daughter...no, it doesn't sound fair. Again, the problem here, in my opinion, is that the husband seems to be expecting his wife to step up and solve a problem that's not hers. What's going to happen later in life, when both girls need to go to college and dad didn't prepare for that? Is he going to expect his wife to help him?", "I disagree that that is \"100% reasonable\".. he knew his daughter was competing and could POSSIBLY win and need to go on this trip.  To me it's 100% UNREASONABLE for him to think he didn't need to save that money.  He literally thought his child would *fail* and actively saved nothing because of that belief.   Imagine telling your kid that?", "It's not tough at all, separate finances means separate finances.", "I 100% agree with this as far as the preparation aspect. My daughter is in the competitive cheer world. Some teams have a goal of receiving a \u2018world bid\u2019 which take s them to Florida to compete. Other teams just compete at a lower level. But those teams can also win what is called an \u2018open bid\u2019 or even a \u2018world bid\u2019 but you can turn them down. It\u2019s just more rare for these teams to be given a bid if you are not working toward one and not competing that level of routine.  I\u2019m assuming this was a surprise bid and the team decided to go for it in Florida. \n\nSo yes he wasn\u2019t saving for it throughout the year because he didn\u2019t expect that she would be going. Cheer itself is really expensive without going to worlds. If they could work out some sort of loan or borrow if that is what works for them that would be best. Because if his daughter sees them going on vacation while she is the reason her team can\u2019t go to Florida it\u2019s going create a lot of animosity. Remember this is a teen girl. They are not known for their rationality.", "Agreed. This is a situation where you and your husband need to sit down quietly and negotiate through the situation...for the good of BOTH girls, not just Hailey.\n\nGiving you an NTA, but if Jenna doesn't get to go to her competition while you and Hailey take off on a fun vacation yourselves, I'll reverse that judgement in a hurry. That's a plain shitty idea.", "I think there was every reason her husband should have saved. However unlikely there was always a possibility this would happen. What would he be doing had they both won? He couldn\u2019t take her money so then what??\n\nIf they have always kept their finances for their children split, I don\u2019t think he has any right to any of it regardless of context of him as a father or where he spends his money (sensible or not).\n\nJust because the trip may not be happening that is still her money she saved for her daughter as per their agreement and he has no right to be so entitled to it and so harsh about her saying no! \n\nNTA - you are sticking to a long held agreement.", "In her edit she says that he wouldn't be willing to pay her back because they're family.

Also additional info that I feel makes her NTA.", "Agreed. Like, it doesn't technically make OP an asshole, but it will definitely damage the 'family unit' because it makes it obvious how little interest or care OP has for her stepkid.

It doesn't matter if the parents find it convenient. It still sucks for the kids. \n\nAnd yes, the husband should not be trying to change it only when and as it's convenient for him. But neither of them should have a policy that dysfunctional in the first place.", "It was literally going to be a small trip I don\u2019t understand why everyone assumed it would be in Florida", ">\"Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.\"\n\nEXACTLY!!", "I get what you're saying, but he's not the one who stands to be hurt the most here: her stepdaughter is. He's an AH for not planning for this possibility and then for practically demanding the money when that is clearly not their period agreement. But I don't think the assessment is so simple in this situation, because he's not the one who is going to face the consequences of his (in)action. \n\nIt's a tough situation. She's upset and rightfully so. But I don't think that taking her own daughter to Disney while her stepdaughter sits at home - her entire team unable to attend - is a morally justifiable position, and that is going to sour her relationship with her stepdaughter for a long time. I feel like there has to be some kind of compromise here that is good for both girls. Is it fair that OP is in this position? No. But when we're talking about family relationships and children's well-being, sometimes the adults have to suck it up. I'm not saying that she should just pay outright, but she and her husband could look at some options together to figure out how to put together enough money for her stepdaughter to attend the competition with her team and for her/her daughter to take a trip. Maybe they sell some items of his that have value; maybe they ask the stepdaughter to contribute some birthday/Christmas money; maybe OP contributes some of the money she'd saved and plans a more budget-friendly trip; maybe they talk to grandparents and see if they'd be willing to contribute to the cost in lieu of Christmas gifts. There are options here, and they need to work together to figure out how to make something good happen for both girls.

Will the same apply for college too?", "He HAS left her high and dry for way more important things regarding Hailey according to comments. Braces and surgery.", "Exactly. I didn't see anywhere where the OP wrote that they were saving money together in case their daughters made it to this point. If the situation was reversed, it's doubtful that he would just hand the money over. They handle money separately when it comes to the girls.", "They are both AH for having that rule. Gross.", "We have an account together just enough for those expenses.", "It does definitely affect Hailey sometimes but she never complains and is very understanding how expensive cheer is. I do feel badly for Jenna but Haileys father and I have both done without luxuries to make sure she can enjoy a great cheer season.", "Except that for the ideal situation to work, OP\u2019s husband would have to be saving and contributing to the pot as well, and his ex would have to be putting on for Jenna just like OP\u2019s ex does for Hailey. Maybe not identical amounts, but everyone making sacrifices. OP and her ex made sacrifices while Jenna\u2019s parents didn\u2019t. Now they want OP and potentially her ex to make up for that.

My first thought was this is a perfect recipe for causing their children to resent them and their step-sister in the future.", "Agreed. My husband and I (who each brought in a child) have semi-separated finances. We contribute to a shared pot and keep some spending opaque and distinct, including *some* really discretionary costs for our respective children in adulthood. But during their childhood and even after for the big things, there's no separation, it comes from the shared pot. They each got cars with no quibbling about who paid, they each got school fees, they each got household startup costs, they each get the same contribution if we invite them on a partly-subsidised family holiday, they'll each get contributions to their weddings. They know each gets some things from their other-parents that the other doesn't get, that's fine, but each of them gets all the key things within our family unit. Any other approach is just asking for trouble. Separate finances without any emotional impact is a privilege of self-sufficient adults. For dependents, providing is intertwined with love, there's no getting around it.", "While you're point makes sense, I'm not convinced that had the roles been reversed, he would have paid out to have her daughter go.", "It doesn't matter how you put it, disparities will always come up. What happens if one of the exes if better off than the other, thus, better set to provide for their children? Are you supposed to use what your ex gives for their children to a common pool where the other partner may not be able to put in as much? Wait for brows to start raising because it is not fair that child support that's supposed solely for a child, as is this case, goes to compensate for the parent who is not able to provide.   \n\n\nI guess this is always going to be an issue with blended families, and this is why these arrangements are made beforehand.

Unless you signed a pre-nup, you're going to have a fun time dividing up assets when this falls apart and you learn how things actually get split up.\n\nMy husband and I keep some things separate but it's more of a division of duties than it is anything else. I use my money to handle the stuff that stresses him out, he uses his to handle the stuff that stresses me out.

I can't believe how common it is stumbling across reddit posts where situations like this occur. I was always of the belief that if you married someone who had kids, those kids are now your kids as well and should be treated as such, including financially.

Mom married my stepfather when I was in middle school around the same time dad married wife #4.

Honestly, in a few instances it was my stepmother & stepfather that offered to help me before my bio parents had a chance to.

You mentioned it yourself in one of your previous comments, and I whole heartedly agree. It's not wrong to feel that way, especially when your husband, or significant other, as in OP's case, is clearly looking to take advantage of the situation, because nothing in the post suggests that he would be able or willing to step up for OP's daughter when the occassion arises. When one of the adults involved (in this case, four) is this opportunistic, it's hard for the other part to be willing to step up without looking down the road and coming to the conclusion that, even when there should be two other adults involved in the equation, there are only two of them left to the task.
