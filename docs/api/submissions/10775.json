His company are so keen that he goes that they\u2019ve offered to either give him a large bonus or pay for me to attend. He chose for me to go as we have never been abroad together.\n\nHowever, I just found out (trip is 2 weeks from now) that I will need to leave the house by 8.15 in order to make the plane. I take medication each morning which makes me alert after I take it (after 30 mins or so) but also makes me crash each night and I struggle to wake up the next day after the very deep sleep (although ironically I can\u2019t stay awake through the day without it). I\u2019m dependent on this medication and have tried to stop taking it or just cut down, but suffered not only tiredness but other side effects which made me miserable and unable to function properly.\n\nI\u2019ve said I hope to make the trip but can\u2019t guarantee it. I don\u2019t want him to be panicked if I let him down last minute, I\u2019d rather he be prepared that even if he tries hard to wake me, I may not be ready on time (I often can\u2019t even get together enough to take the medication for a while as I\u2019m so exhausted but once I take it I\u2019m very alert within half an hour) but I\u2019ll try and I\u2019ll do what I can.\n\nHe was extremely upset and asked if he should cancel my ticket which I said is his choice (though I\u2019d rather go, if I can). He doesn\u2019t want this but now says he feels I\u2019m unreliable as a life partner which really hurts as I\u2019ve supported him through some really bad times and he has always claimed to be grateful.\n\nHe said he\u2019s gone from really looking forward to a romantic trip to seeing it as a sign of how little I care about him. My time management is awful in general but he has no idea how painfully tired I am when I wake up - I work from home and try to never make commitments before 11am.\n\nI love him so much and really do want a romantic getaway with him, I just don\u2019t want to lie and be a sudden let down and although I can try very hard, I can\u2019t be sure I\u2019ll make the plane. AITA?\n\nEdits for clarification: I am ok with him cancelling, he wants me to \u2018just do it\u2019.\nI will try as hard as possible but may not be able to go.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to break up or even just take someone else.\nWe are planning to get married.\nIt\u2019s ADHD medication which I function much better with than before I took it.\nI take it when I wake up so no, can\u2019t just take earlier.\nI sleep when I crash so I can\u2019t just sleep earlier.\nI didn\u2019t know the flight time - he said it wasn\u2019t early.\nI do want to go and I do love him very much and he loves me too.", "created_utc": 1677204553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11afp0l/aita_for_not_guaranteeing_i_can_get_up_to_go_to/", "score": 1321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will say that I was lucky to have a doctor that helped me to make sure I was functionally medicated but also able to be a more reliable human, if only for myself (I\u2019m also on the spectrum so ironically routine is very important to me so struggling with waking up is very disregulating for me, as well).

Have your partner make you take your meds at the second alarm. You will then be alert 1/2 hr later and go enjoy Greece!!

Um, are you her doctor? The answer to that is NO!  I\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with adhd (in my 40s). Realising why I was/wasn\u2019t doing things now makes sense. People saying \u201cdon\u2019t use adhd as an excuse. I have it and can do xyz\u201d. Well bully for you mate! Why can\u2019t she use it as an excuse? It literally impacts on daily life affecting sleep, memory, executive function, task management, time management and a host of other things. Someone said in a comment \u201cthe world doesn\u2019t revolve around you\u201d which is true. But the world doesn\u2019t accommodate people who diverge from what is considered \u201ctypical\u201d. \n\nMy meds don\u2019t give me that side effect. But I know what it feels like because if I eat Soy, I cannot open my eyes in the morning. It is like trying to wake up from an anaesthetic. I obviously avoid soy so this doesn\u2019t happen. But to tell someone to stop taking / change the time of prescribed medication that helps them function for the rest of the day, to go on a holiday is frankly irresponsible. \n\nAnd OP, this next bit may come off as a bit harsh, but it\u2019s just something you should think about. It\u2019s great that your partner wanted to go on a romantic holiday with you. But a couple of things- 1. You said you live together, so surely he is aware of your daily sleep schedule and effects of your medication. His work probably booked the time of the flights, but to assume that you would suddenly be guaranteed to be able to function at at earlier time is a bit presumptuous of him. And 2. he\u2019s going for work. It\u2019s a business trip. How much time is he actually going to be spending with you? And,to me, but it\u2019s pretty unromantic to have your first o/s \u201cromantic\u201d holiday to be a business trip on the company dime. I would say that you\u2019re going to have to make the decision on this one. Like, now.

I highly recommend returning to your doctor or a therapist to find out if there are ways you can counteract this side-effect - more from a safety aspect than anything else, a fire is a massive risk for you if you struggle to wake up. There are a lot of online resources that make fabulously obnoxious alarm systems that could help jolt you awake, or maybe an adjustment to the times you take your medication?

So when pressed immediately you might reject, but then might adopt the suggestion a bit later... which can be frustrating for people offering help, but eh, everyone moves at their own speed...!\n\nIf the above, I have personally found it has been very helpful to point out my slowness in digesting advice to people offering it (this obviously only applies when you are seeking help! Not to unwelcome advice - though that's not the case here as you sought out people's opinions). This is helpful because it makes them realise that their help is not unappreciated nor unheeded - that I am taking in their suggestion and pondering it, so what might initially superficially look like plain rejection is actually just slow processing/anxiety/overwhelm (and then, when forewarned in this way, they start to notice when I later do adopt the advice too!).

I get everyone reacts differently and all, but this kinda thing doesn't seem normal. Granted, my only experience is adderall, which is a stimulant. Works like coffee. With adderall you usually have to take it at or before a specific time, or else it affects sleep. For me, if I take it after 9-9:30 a.m., I don't sleep. There's also a balance when it comes to dosages. Too low a dosage and it doesn't work, too high and you get side effects. For me, 25mg is the sweet spot. I've tried 30mg, and while it's more effective, it makes me irritable and easily agitated. Which leads into my next point - ADHD meds can interact weirdly with bipolar disorder. I've heard many stories of people with bipolar mistakenly diagnosed with ADHD and getting prescribed ADHD meds, only to have the meds either do nothing or exacerbate the symptoms.\n\nTL;DR: in my completely uneducated opinion (as i'm not a doctor), she's either on the wrong meds or is taking too high a dosage.", "Yeah, this rings clearest of all.

OP will not accept your verdict of YTA.  OP claims they've tried everything, but is not willing to try the things they  haven't yet tried. OP is not willing to just cut the partner loose so he can just take someone else.  He can cancel on OP, but he has to be the bad guy: OP won't step aside.  OP's preferred approach is to leave the part in complete suspense on the morning of the trip as to whether OP will come.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* OP has ADHD.  The medicine is Vyvanse.  Many  YTA votes come from people who have been on vyvanse, have experienced similar issues, and are familiar with struggles to wake.  (Granted meds can affect people differently,).\n* OP has claimed the major issue is that unless they wake later in the day, they need to take their medication before they can fully alert/awake.  They can't wake up enough to take the pill.  Many people have provided suggestions of how OP could possibly wake up just long enough to take meds.  **But OP has tried \"everything\" y'all (/s).**  All possible combinations involving alarm clocks have been tried.  Yet...\n   * OP and partner live together, and partner would be getting up at the same time. Could he shake  OP awake just long enough to take meds? OP avoids this question, or in one case says they don't actually know.  So apparently OP has not tried physical shaking.  (On a personal note, I had a friend who was on very powerful sleep meds, where no alarm clock would wake her, and left to her own devices she'd wake at 2 pm every day, but when we traveled together she gave me permission to shake her awake, and that did work.)\n   * When OP sets an alarm clock across the room, OP apparently wakes up enough to get up and walk across the room to turn it off.  This isn't an \"alert\" form of awake, but multiple people have suggested that if OP is just awake enough to walk,  a loving partner could probably guide them to taking a pill and a sip of water.  OP seems to think this is absurd, and perhaps akin to torture (apparently OP has not tried this).  Having someone they love put a pill in their mouth is apparently worse than missing a trip to Greece.\n   * Could OP's partner wake OP up by splashing or pouring water? OP has called this suggestion absurd, and likened it to torture.  Getting wet is apparently worse than missing a trip to Greece.\n   * could someone use loud noise to wake up OP (air horn, banging pots and pans?): OP couldn't POSSIBLY: they live with other people y'all.  Apparently these other people can put up with OP trying multiple alarm clocks going off every 10 minutes, but they can't possibly be expected to tolerate a single instance of a very loud noise for a purpose such as getting OP to Greece.  It does not appear that OP has asked their roommates whether they might possibly be ok with a very loud noise at the not-that-early time of 8:30 AM, one time only.\n   * For some suggestions (packing the night before, going to sleep dressed), OP says they will \"try\", but doesn't comment on suggestions to do a dry run or experiment with any of the above in the TWO weeks between now and the trip.  OP only commits to try on the morning-of.  They may or may not get up.\n* Should OP talk to their doctor about how extremely these meds affect them?  Apparently OP's doctor is fully aware of the extreme nature of the side effects and is totally fine with them.  (note that OP responds in a comment that if there was a fire in their house before 10 am, there is a legitimate chance that OP couldn't be roused and would just die.  And apparently OP's doctor is totally cool with that.  Some folks might consider whether OP should reach out to another doctor, or whether OP's doctor may not in fact be aware of the degree of the issue that OP describes, but OP sees no benefit in raising this with their doctor again).\n* Given all of the above, one might think that OP should just cut the partner loose (by which I mean on this trip, not in life, though some posters have certainly suggested that as well).  It is too late for the partner to get the cash bonus, but he could take a friend.  OP says they wouldn't mind if the partner decided to do that, but OP is not willing to tell the partner to do that.  OP wants to keep open the option to let their partner down at the very last minute. If partner wants to take someone else who can definitely come, OP is forcing him to be the bad guy.", "YTA.

But even if you do go, I'm concerned how the same issue will affect your (and his) time in Greece. If you're coming from the US, that's what, a 6-hour time difference? Won't that screw up your waking/sleeping hours even worse? I fear neither of you thought this through. And if you are truly unable to commit to anything ever before like 11 a.m., well, that is what it is but you and your partner need to be clear on that and plan accordingly.", "Info: have you looked into doing a sleep study? \n\nI\u2019m not going to say I know why you feel the way you do, but as someone with severe ADHD (and it sounds like you\u2019re on Vyvanse like me - am I close?), the tiredness definitely shouldn\u2019t be a side effect of your meds in a life destructing way. Like we take meds to help us get through the day to day better, it shouldn\u2019t prevent us from doing what we want to.\n\nThat said, a very common symptom of ADHD is sleep problems. I\u2019m fortunate that the vyvanse actually helps me sleep more regularly. Another thing is it helps me keep up with routine. In some of your other comments, it seems like you prefer not having a schedule, which I have to call out: it\u2019s going to make the meds feel less effective because your body needs routine! If your body is used to crashing, falling asleep at the same time mid-day every day, the ADHD meds are basically going to solidify that routine for you and it gets harder and harder to break.\n\nI highly recommend putting more effort into setting a schedule to work towards keeping up because it should help regulate your sleep. And you should absolutely look into a sleep study even if you don\u2019t want to change your routine. Whether or not your insurance supports it, plenty of universities will have some program that would be inexpensive or free.\n\nThe ADHD, neurodivergent struggle is really real. Keep talking about it with other NDs and your doctor to figure out what works best for you and also look into getting a weighted blanket if you don\u2019t have one yet!  \n\nAdhd burnout is also a thing, and laying horizontally for a while can help your nervous system reset - add in a weighted blanket to help calm the over stimulation and this could help your body recoup throughout the day and lessen the need for naps and the harshness of that crash.\n\nI hope it works out for you so you can actually enjoy free international trips.

All you have to do is get in the car, get in the plane and when you wake up you'll be in Greece!\n\nSeriously how do you do anything if you can't make any kind of commitment before 11? \n\nI have anxiety, depression and ADHD and I have to get up at 345 in the morning for work at my shitty grocery job, I'd stay awake for 24 hours to go to Greece. I get it that meds are an issue, some of the ones I've tried have just made me feel flat out fucking drunk but something feels like you need to see your doctor again, you're probably being over medicated or you just really don't want to try.\n\nI hope for you that you go on the trip.", "INFO: in the event you are unable to wake up on time, have you considered ways in which you would make it up to your boyfriend? Like taking him out somewhere as an apology?", "YTA. You need to talk to your doctor about going on a different medication. Like you, I take ADHD meds daily and rely on them throughout the day. I also work at 6am and manage to get myself out of bed in the morning to get there. \n\nYou absolutely can make at 8:15 leave time. Get everything ready the night before, sleep in your travel clothes, have your partner force your meds into your throat if you have to.", "I\u2019m late to this post but I still want to share my two cents after reading replies from OP. Now I\u2019m not a psychiatrist or doctor but I do have ADHD and I also take Vyvanse though likely a much lower dose than you, OP. To me the problem you have isn\u2019t the Vyvanse but the time you are taking it. From what I gather you get up around 11 am and at that point it\u2019s imo too late to be taking a high dose of Vyvanse. Does your doctor even know when you get up and when you go to bed? Regardless there is absolutely no reason the Vyvanse should make it impossible for you to get up. I open at work some days and have to get up at 5 am and I don\u2019t have a problem doing that even if I\u2019m tired/groggy. Unfortunately you are now stuck in an unhealthy cycle that will be hard to fix. I don\u2019t think skipping one dose will make you withdraw horribly as I\u2019ve missed one before and been fine but you don\u2019t seem willing to change or try something else. I feel sorry for your fianc\u00e9 because you don\u2019t seem to love him as much as he loves you. You should\u2019ve told him to take the bonus. For me, YTA.", "YTA. Not many people can put up with a life partner who is completely unreliable. You\u2019re making excuses before an issue even occurred.

If your medication is doing this to you, you should speak to your medical team. \nYou seem really indifferent towards his feelings about this and self-absorbed.

Grow up and stop making excuses for yourself OP", "You realize if you two plan on you going & you don\u2019t make it, it will likely be the end of your relationship? \n\nHe will have 2 weeks in Greece to think about how you let him down. \n\nNow, is there an option of you flying later in the day & meeting him?", "NTA\n\nLots of people on this site have no earthly idea what it's like to have a neurological condition. Neither do most of the people in your life. They constantly expect you to magically stop having symptoms if it's important enough. Symptoms you have every single day, that make your life harder or even hell, and they think if you can't make it go away on this one occasion then you don't truly love them, because it's a special day, so how dare you. People who love you and are enormally accepting of your condition suddenly get upset because it's their birthday, because it's their cousin's wedding, because they are having a hard time at work, and so they really need you to not be disabled for a change. Disability doesn't work like that.\n\nThey don't understand because they never went through this and \\*they\\* never had this issue so surely \"it can't be that hard\".\n\nThis is a test of your relationship.

I do. They don\u2019t know the debilitating headache and feeling that your body is paralyzed. If my room was on fire I am not sure if I will be able to overcome it and run out of the room. They don\u2019t know how severe ADHD can be and what difference the medication makes.\nMy doctor said that the reason it happens to me is that my overactive brain doesn\u2019t stop working during night. My body might be exhausted and sleeping, but my brain keeps working until the morning and at the time it completely exhausted and can\u2019t go on anymore, this is the time I try to wake up.\n\nOne medication helped me tremendously- I tried Topamax for weight loss purposes and after a few weeks I started waking up at 7am, fresh and energetic like a cucumber. Now, mind you, Topamax slows down your brain, it\u2019s commonly referred to as Dopamax because it makes you dumb.  For me it slowed down my brain at night and my brain was resting and for the first time in my life I felt like a normal human being. Didn\u2019t lose any weight BTW. \nUnfortunately, After 2 years I started having issues with recalling names and my doctor suspected that it might be the side effect of Topamax and took me off it out of caution. \n\n\nNow I am back to mornings from hell.\n\nNTA. I feel you. Stay strong.", "NAH. I also have ADHD, and I couldn't have written your post any better. Therapy has helped massively with my time blindness. Now, I wake earlier than necessary to accommodate the unavoidable morning fog. You can also pack/get ready 2 days before, don't take your meds the day before, then take your meds the morning of. These types of strategies will help you from getting in your own way. We have to make our own fail-safes because existing in the world is very difficult. \n\nPlan to wake 2 hours early, take your meds early as well, and this will help you make the flight with greater ease. Also, it sounds like you should have your meds and their dosage reassessed by your psych. It sounds like they help your ADHD symptoms, but cause other issues for you. Your life can be better and smoother. Just call/email (I know, easier said than done) and book a consultation. Y'all are probably already meeting regularly because you're prescribed a scheduled substance. \n\nAlso, longer term, medication is not enough without therapy to make new habits. (Therapy is also COMPLETELY useless without medication). Get the other half of the treatment, and your life will slowly improve. But... I don't want to make it sound easy.

OP should talk with their doctor.\n\nIf OP can't commit to the flight in advance, then they shouldn't commit at all. It's a YTA from me.", "Gonna have to disagree with you on the meds not having these effects, my husband took Vyvanse and had a very similar issue. When the meds wore off, they wore OFF. It was like flipping a switch from on to off. He would crash so hard. He didn\u2019t stay on that one for long, though.", "How ableist can you be in just 5 short sentences? Jeez.\n\nAt the point in which OP and their partner are considering marriage then their partner should know their limitations. OP said they asked about the time and their partner said it wasn't early. They probably have different concepts of early. \n\nOP you're NTA, can you ask your partner to stay with you the night before and force you to take your medication at the necessary time in the morning?", "Thank you for your input! Everyone reacts differently to meds, so its important to get as many perspectives as possible", "If I had to bet on something, I'd bet that OP has DSPD. The cash she describes when her meds wear off is far out of the norm of the usual ADHD meds crash and I imagine it may be a side effect. \n\n>Seriously, OP, sounds more like narcolepsy or another sleep disorder than ADHD, though I suppose it's possible to have both\n\nSleep disorders are known comorbidities of ADHD, though I don't remember the rate of comorbidity at the top of my head. That said, while not as common as anxiety or depression, it's common in ADHD. Anecdotally, of all the ADHD people I know, there's only one that has no sleep disorders or sleep issues.", "I don't know if you've seen them, but those pop it toys come in bracelet form.

If OP literally can't get up and is disoriented for hours after waking, it sounds like something a lot more complicated/severe than a different circadian rhythm than the alleged standard", "I also don\u2019t know anyone with ADHD and narcolepsy, but I was able to find a [2020 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31739230/) attesting to the comorbidity: \n\n>The prevalence of ADHD symptoms was >30%, making it an important comorbidity of narcolepsy. Future studies should be performed to better assess the relationship between ADHD and narcolepsy.", "I personally used to have *a lot* of trouble waking up and getting started in the morning, especially if I wasn\u2019t following my own rhytm. I now manage my wake up time by setting a pill alarm 1.5 hours before my needed wake up time, which ensures that my Vyvanse has time to start working by the time my feet touch the ground. I also use a sunrise alarm clock starting at 4:30 am (when my pill alarm goes off) to help.\n\nIMO, whether OP has narcolepsy, DSPD, hypersomnia or whatever doesn\u2019t matter much in the context of this post. What matters is their strict refusal to attempt anything to wake up early when needed. At this point, given the many times it\u2019s been mentioned in the comments, OP is surely aware that she could try setting a pill alarm! Countless other tips have also been given to her, but it seems that they\u2019ve all been rejected.", "Cold brew coffee also removes a lot of the acidity & is better for the stomach, that might be worth trying, if you do like coffee. You can make it the night before & grab it out the fridge in the morning, it\u2019s very tasty", "Agree that OP is making a choice here, and while it's her choice to decide how to run her life, she's definitely in asshole territory and I wouldn't be surprised if her partner sets the boundary that he's not staying with her if she can't learn to manage her condition and commit to decisions she made.", ">I did a bold move when I got tired of refilling my weekly pill box, I realized that most of the energy is from getting out the stuff and going through medication by medication, so I bought a second box! It's so lovely to only have to refill them twice a month\n\nAnother bold move would be to ask your pharmacist to prefill your pill box for the whole month. I don't know if all of them do it, but I know it can be done. It might involve a fee, but I'm of the opinion that some problems are best dealt with throwing money at it (if one has money to throw at problems, of course)."]}
