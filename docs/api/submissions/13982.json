Hi reddit, I'm in a pickle.\n\nLast week, my (29m) younger cousin (21m) passed away unexpectedly. It came as a huge shock and has taken a massive toll on my family. In the meantime, I have been there for my family and other younger cousins to support them.\n\nI thought I was doing okay and shielded myself and others thinking my emotions were in check. Though, I've come to realise I'm not fine at all. I feel utterly sad, lonely and anxious. These feelings are exacerbated when I'm alone.\n\nMy partner (26f) socialises every Monday and Tuesday night, and all day Saturday. For context, she has a real sense of community through this and a great group of friends. This is something she has lacked before and gets a real mental health boost from this. I love seeing her so happy.\n\nSo I mentioned to her yesterday that I was struggling and that being alone made it worse. I asked if she would stay in the house to be with me yesterday night and tonight.\n\nShe agreed to yesterday but not tonight. She cited her need to look after her own mental health. She has suggested I speak to my family or friends. The truth is, I don't want to burden my family, who are hurting, and I don't have any friends who I'd feel comfortable being vulnerable with. So she offered alternative solutions but I find the most comfort in her.\n\nWhy I'm upset about this is because I've supported her in the past and been her rock in times of need. Yet, in my time of need, I am not seemingly a priority. Today, I've communicated with her as if everything's cool and okay; but, really, I'm disappointed and feel this isn't how to treat a partner of six years going through a tough period.\n\nReddit, AITA? I see her perspective, and that she has provided alternative solutions, but my head's too foggy to think clearly.", "created_utc": 1680620069, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bljie/aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_stay_in_the_house/", "score": 2888, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is what partnership is about, it's a give and take and sometimes we need more than we can give. You asked for help, because you need help. Please don't ever let yourself believe asking for help when you need it makes you in any way shape or form an a-hole. My husband has been struggling with anxiety this year, and has asked me this many times. I did have the conversation eventually that I can't stay home all the time/what is best for me, but not until it had truly become a routine request. This is a period of pain and grief, and you're allowed to ask things of your partner that sometimes require sacrifice. You don't have to be strong all the time friend. Sending you love.", "NTA...Your ask is simply not large enough for me to see it any other way.", "Definitely NTA. You are asking for very little time with her and she can\u2019t clear her social schedule during your time of need and grief?

Your wife might be feeling stressed that you're relying only on her.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I would be upset too. Idk if its because i cant see myself socializing thst much in a week more than necessary but to me she can afford to stay for that week and just accompang you.

I understand her need to look after her own mental health and I firmly believe in the \"a girlfriend is not a pacifier\" principle. But you're not in a normal situation, and you're not asking her to do this as a regular thing. You've lost somebody important to you, and you're asking for a couple of days. That's well within reason, and I think she should be supporting you that far, unless there's an important factor we aren't hearing or something.", "NTA - definitely not the AH for asking. Nor hoping for consideration.", "NTA I am \ud83d\udcaf for someone taking care of themselves. Truly. You asked for one night. I mean, you didn\u2019t say remove yourself from your circle.

Don\u2019t keep anything in. \n\nyou may feel like talking to your family might burden them.

I would break up with her.", "NTA that was a perfectly reasonable and normal ask of a partner, when faced with tragedy and shock.  You didn't ask her to give up her socializing permanently, you asked for 2 days.  That's fair.  Her not giving that to you is very cold, IMO.", "NTA but dude, you don\u2019t want to burden others with your feelings so you bottle them up? Talk to your family. They miss your cousin too and there\u2019s comfort in shared memories.\n\nAnd seek some therapy for yourself - you\u2019re viewing your emotions as a burden that you put on other people. \n1. That\u2019s not healthy for you. \n2. That\u2019s not healthy for your partner (I mean in general, I\u2019m not siding with your GF here). If you had a partner who was supportive the way you are, they still can\u2019t be your only emotional outlet or support. \n\nThey can and should be your main one, sure. But not your only one. So you need to get more comfortable talking to others and find some emotional outlets outside your relationship. This is unrelated to Your (current) GF as her response sucks.", "NTA, You do need support but not wanting to burden your family just means you want to place all responsibility on your partner and that\u2019s not fair either. You might find that talking with your family is super helpful and cathartic because they knew your cousin and can share in your grief. Your grief isn\u2019t a burden btw. It\u2019s ok to ask for support when you need it. Your feelings are valid.\n\nThat said, her taking a few days out from socializing to focus on you shouldn\u2019t detract from her mental health. She is coming off pretty selfish here. You should tell her how it makes you feel that she isn\u2019t willing to be supportive during a really hard time. Her reaction will be really telling.", "You are most certainly NTA. She sounds very dismissive, selfish, and quite honestly, cruel. \n\nYou are going through a traumatic experience, and a good partner would SUPPORT their significant other. You verbalized you need support and how she can give it. She refused and prioritized herself.\n\nMy advice is to bail while you can. When things get tough, partners truly reveal themselves. This is a red flag of epic proportions.", "NTA if staying with your SO is a mental health risk, they shouldnt be your SO", "NTA\n\nThere are women out there who actually care about and support their partners btw OP. This girl isn't all that, you can do better.", "Nta", "People\u2019s responses to grief are so weird. NTA, OP! That was a reasonable request. I could see her wanting a night out if she had been staying in with you for weeks after your loss, but not from 1 night.", "You should tell her exactly what you put in this post. In a nice way. If she still holds her ground, and is unwilling to compromise, you may need to reevaluate. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour partner of 6 years is showing you where you stand.  You are not a priority to her when it inconveniences her.  That is a red flag.  I'd have a serious sit down conversation with her about it.", "She\u2019s selfish, mate. She\u2019s showing you her true colors. Staying in with you for a couple of nights isn\u2019t going to do anything bad for her mental health. She just chooses herself over you. Having a good time is more important to her than supporting her partner during a difficult period. \n\nCut her loose, mate. She ain\u2019t the one.", "First, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nI'm going with NTA, with a little N A H and I'll go into why.\n\nFirst, I don't think that asking for two nights is unreasonable, especially when this death JUST happened. I worry what your partner believes the state of her mental health is and how fragile it must be that she thinks missing two nights is going to have a massive effect on her.\n\nHowever, her mental health is going to come in to play as you process your grief. I'm 14 months into grieving the death of my mom. Like you, I am the stoic one in my family. I haven't cried in front of my dad. I keep things under control so as to be his support. \n\nMy partner, however, sees *everything* and has had to be my support. This has put a major strain on him and on our relationship.\n\nGrief takes a massive toll not only on us but also on those around us. Because we feel emotional safety with our partners, sometimes it can be easy to forget that they do have to actually maintain their own mental health first in order to be there for us.\n\nAgain, I went with NTA because I don't think two nights is unreasonable at all, especially so close to the death. It's true she'll need to keep up her mental health, but you're not even in the thick of it yet.\n\n(Also I found this and the book it came from helpful in understanding my grief and asking for support. The PDF is to the folks in your life who may not understand what you're going through: https://refugeingrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/grieving-friend-essay-PDF.pdf)", "NTA. You're grieving and feeling isolated, and, because it was a sudden shock to your whole family, you feel you don't have a support system outside of your partner. It's totally reasonable that you'd want her to prioritize you during this difficult time.\n\nHowever, I wonder if your attitude toward not wanting to burden anyone, and communicating with your partner now \"as if everything's cool and okay\" is leading her to believe your emotional needs aren't really as serious as you know they are. She may feel that she's meeting you halfway, when you know you need more than that.\n\nIs there a chance you'd be willing to leave the house and participate in an activity with her? Not with her group of friends, but just the two of you? You might find it beneficial to get out of the house regardless (from personal experience, I know that stewing in your grief at home can make that loneliness worse), and then she would also feel that you're meeting her halfway with HER emotional needs as well.\n\nEither way, I think pretending everything is fine will probably give her the wrong impression, and she'll be less likely to understand how much you're hurting. If you haven't already, you definitely need to have a serious, sit-down conversation about how you're feeling, how all this is affecting you, and what, specifically, she could do to help you feel less alone.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I hope the coming days and weeks bring peace for you and your family.", "I'm wondering if she's committed to you or her social life. Seems like you've been there for her but she can't return the favor.", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable for you to ask and she should be there for you. She can\u2019t miss a couple of days? What\u2019s going on there that\u2019s more important to her.", "NTA. And if you are thinking of marrying this person, remember, she can't be there for you for a few days, 'for worse'.", "Info: what is her socialization? Is it a commitment that she has made? \n\nInfo 2: is she your only support system? As someone who feels others pain, I do recognize the strain that it puts on me. If she socializes 3 times a week, she\u2019s already said she\u2019ll stay home once - that means 5 days of emotional support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Speaking for myself and fully aware that this not true for everyone and every situation, I think that it could help if you face your pain more. When it comes, don't run from it, deal with it. Maybe you want to write your cousin a letter, telling him how much you miss him and what you appreciated about him. Or paint. Build something. But don't distract yourself.

Although it was the start of a long journey that hasn't ended yet, my general outview on life brightened, when I began to deal with the pain. What I'm trying to say: If you really want to cry, in that moment it feels bad and if you push it away, you avoid the pain in the moment. But if you let yourself deeply feel that pain and cry, after the tears stopped, the heart becomes much lighter again. Probably there will be another wave of pain, but if go through it, expressing it in any way, the pain dissolves. If you push it constantly away, the pain is just hidden under the surface.\n\nIf you read that, I hope it helps you.

Men deserve to have their feelings too, and her not heading out for a few nights when you obviously needed her company won't do any damage to her mental health, at least not as bad as she thinks.\n\nI also understand your feelings entirely.

Right now, there's nothing to be done, and the GF should be able to stay home a bit extra, but this level of emotional isolation isn't sustainable in the long-term.", "This is my take as well, and the judgement (N-A-H but ultimately NTA). OP is in a fog right now and can't advocate for how much his partner's regular socializing helps her own emotional health right now. The grief of a partner is an expected burden to bear but does cost emotional energy. He does know her socializing a critical part of her emotional health. That said, one singular night off from 2 regular meetings is not an unreasonable request. OP seems to be in a bit of a crisis and needs some immediate emotional support, and IMO his request for 2 days comes from a place of good emotional intelligence. \n\nIt saddens me to see other comments jumping to her being an AH as if she hasn't proven to have underlying struggles with her own mental health. IMO she should give this friend night to her partner, but she's not a hard AH for advocating for her own mental health: to me it mainly reads as she's anxious about the negative impact that giving up that night might have. If I was her friend I'd gently encourage her to try it for her partners sake, and her outcome may pleasantly surprise her and give her confidence in her progress.\n\nYou said something similar in your comment: this is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. That said, OP should try to get to a place where he can manage his grieving process sustainably. We all have our own brains to care for.", "Totally agree. Also, OP, you mentioned feeling drained by being there for the rest of your family. Please remember you are also grieving and your mental health matters too.

Please keep an eye on what else you need as you try to support your family.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "Info 2 is important. If she's utilizing her friend system as emotional support, in addition to him, then that's less of a burden on him. If he won't utilize his friend system for emotional support, then he's putting more of a burden on her. That's an unfair imbalance. \n\nPeople are calling her selfish for not giving 2 days of support. That's not correct. She's simply not sacrificing more that 1 day of her own support. She's staying home with him 4 days a week, and increased it to 5 when he communicated a need for extra support.\n\nIf she is unable to give even more without it hurting her mental health, it's time for him to turn to friends, therapy, or both.", "Also, I wonder if she has stayed home and supported him in the past few days  (like last Saturday) and just needs a day for herself in order to be there for him again.", "Right.

I do know it\u2019s really unhealthy to put the sole burden of your emotional support onto one person, though. It\u2019s a lot of pressure on that person and you also run the risk of not getting your needs met.

In fact, when you\u2019re taking care of someone who has mental health problems or is dealing with some sort of crisis, it\u2019s recommended that the caretaker set boundaries around how they can support the other person.

I do understand your concerns, and also appreciate that your girlfriend provided additional places where support could be attained. That is a type of support. \n\nShe\u2019s asking you to find and connect with people who are not just a single person to get support.

He should rethink whatever it is he thinks her has with her.", "NTA time to leave this gf who has low empathy and is selfish. 2 days isn\u2019t a lot", "I agree with this! Men deserve to have supportive friendships that they feel comfortable being vulnerable in. Friends are an important part of a support system, ideally one that composes a partner/partners, friends, family, and (even more ideally, a therapist.) It makes me sad that OP doesn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing his sadness with his friends, and hopefully in the future he can work on those relationships / seek out better friends.", "That's not how relationships work out though. She is being selfish because it is stated that he has helped shoulder her mental health in the past  until she found these groups, and while we have little understanding how long that may have been it matters very little. How is him asking for a couple nights creating an unfair balance in that context? I would bear the weight of my partner's feelings for a year if she would agree to be willing to put in that same energy for a week when I need it. Yes people have different needs and experience things differently, but as a partner we have an obligation to our SO to be there and supportive when they need us most, and sometimes that means an imbalanced load on one partner. Sometimes that means asking things that would not usually be asked of them, in this case sacrificing a second night with friends. OP clearly has hang ups with the friends they do have to not be comfortable talking to them about this, and they can't just magically make it okay with themselves to have that conversation. And getting professional help is costly and time consuming to get seen, and sometimes we just need someone we care about to just be there for us when we really need it in the moment. If this situation turned into something long term like depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts then seeking help is high on the list. But to grieve a family member in the moments/days just following the death is not something that necessarily warrants spending the time and resources to seek therapy. If she can't put her needs on hold for just a little bit to make sure her partner is okay, she clearly does not have the maturity necessary to continue this relationship because she has shown she isn't willing to put him above herself for more than an extra evening.", "Maybe in a normal context, but these are demanding circumstances. A family member just died, and that warrants extra support. If I can't trust my partner to be there in my time of need, I don't care how much they take steps to improve their mental health or how favorably I look at that practice.", "Don't know why you're being downvoted. People just seem to think it's okay for a relationship to be one sided.", "You bring up a good point. I took it as she was going out for a single night and assumed that he didn't adequately express how badly he was doing. Maybe I'm projecting, but when I'm not in a great place, i typically have trouble articulating it to my wife. I tend to internalize it. It seems like this is a common guy thing.", "Yes. The worst.", "Frankly this isn't a good take given what has been presented. I don't see what is unfair for him to ask his partner to be there for him in a time of great need. In fact, she is only home for 4 nights a week since she is gone Monday, Tuesday and all day Saturday with her friends every week so what is ONE week where she spends more time at home for a GRIEVING partner? In fact, I get the impression that OP is happy she has that community because it has been a boon for her mental health. So she has the support, in fact she has a whole community of support so having her own circle to prop her up is not an issue here. If she can't bear the \"emotional burden\" (like, wtf is even that) of her partner of 6 years it appears like she isn't all that invested in OP when she isn't the one in need. There's no \"fairness\" here, and the only thing that you said that I resonated with is if she can't take herself out of her own world to care for him when he has done it for her then OP needs to re-evaluate this relationship.", "No, that's exactly how healthy relationships work. Any therapist will tell you that relying on only one support person is a setup for disaster. You become emotionally dependent on one person, and they become overwhelmed being the sole source of support. \n\nOPs stated the issue is being alone. Yet it sounds like he's only alone 3 nights a week. His hang-ups around friends are his responsibility alone. He could choose to work on them and get emotional support from friends (which is healthy, and men need to start emotionally supporting each other instead of seeking emotional support from female partners only), or ask them to hang out and dostract him with fun activities instead. Dwelling in grief all the time doesn't help either. It's not that hard to say \"I'm sad because someone died. Want to play video games so I don't think about it?\"\n\nAs for therapy, if a paid professional is out of reach, free grief support groups are plentiful. He could seek out an in person support group or find one online. I feel like you are assuming the gf is giving zero support instead of realizing that she's with him more than half her nights, and it's very likely she's offering a lot of support in that time. OP hasn't mentioned anything about her being mean, cold, or ignoring him. His only complaint is that she didn't skip a 2nd social commitment in a row. We don't even know the details on that commitment, if she's feeling burnt out, or if there'd be fallout from her canceling her plans.\n\nHe stated that he's been there for her in the past, not that he was her ONLY source of support. We don't have enough context to know the volume of support each has offered the other in the past. He also stated that she went through a difficult time before having her social groups and time, so we know they are integral to her life balance. You can't fill from an empty cup, and the BEST way to be a good support person for someone else is to make sure you're taking care of yourself first. It's difficult to live with someone who is grieving and depressed, too.\n\nNAH, but there needs to be healthy communication, and everyone's needs are important.", "The assumption is that she also spends the remaining time other than three days a week at home as well. So he didn\u2019t just ask for 2 days and she gave just 1, it\u2019s more like asking for 6 days and getting 5. Also he says in the post he doesn\u2019t want to talk to his family or his friends at all about this. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s tough to make a judgement for me here because it\u2019s is clearly affecting him a great deal, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as cut and dried \u201cyour gf is a heartless monster for only giving you one day!!!!1!1!111one!\u201d as everyone is making it out to be.", "It really isn't ok, barring some sort of wild scenario.If you can't support your partner through the very recent death of a close family member, you're not a good partner.", "Reddit at its finest.", "Bless you.

I won't say it's because I'm 'depressed' - and I'm always there for my bf when he needs me.  OP's gf sounds like she just didn't want to blow off her friends and she's using this as an excuse. OP is NTA.\n\nEdit; errors.", "I'm with you on this one. I can't fathom being with someone for six years, and only being willing to ditch one night of hanging out with friends to comfort them after the death of a family member. I have had short term roommates that were more caring and supportive than OP's girlfriend. I'm not convinced that her justification isn't an excuse either. I get that people need to take care of themselves, but if two nights off from hanging out with your buddies is a bridge too far, how does she possibly function as an adult in the world? What happens when they cancel plans, or she gets sick and can't go out? I'm not buying it. It sounds to me like whatever she goes out and does on Tuesday nights means a lot more to her than her boyfriend.", "I don't think she's a heartless monster, but I do think it's ridiculous she can't just stay home for two days. \n\nIf he asks again next week then we can start having a discussion about her needing her own time too, but a 1 off is bad to turn down.", "Okay but given what we do know, being the death was very recent and her choosing to prioritize herself over her partner almost immediately I think people have enough to form some solid thoughts around her behavior. Yes, being away from her supports can have damaging effects, but it appears to be the case that OP doesn't ask this of her often nor can we assume that they would have asked again after the second night. So that's what? A little over a week at home? Who knows if he would have asked her again if she were to have stayed, but regardless there may now be trust issues because she chose to make her \"community\" the priority during a time of great need. If she can't take herself away for more than a night from this group because her mental health is so fragile then it may be the case she needs professional help for the kind of support she needs.", "As someone with mental illness sometimes you are going through some shit and as such don't have the bandwidth to manage someone else's troubles. It's similar to how they tell you on a plane to put your oxygen mask on yourself before you help anyone else. When i was going through a cancer scare a friend of mine went over the deep end. Believed he was jesus and it was only through his own mental fortitude that the world wouldnt end. I couldnt handle it and ghosted him. He eventually got help, but only after he lost 2 jobs and was evicted from 2 different houses because his roommates were afraid of him. I was busy dealing with my own shit as at the time as I was having a cancer scare that resulted in a total hysterectomy and was actively in an abusive relationship at the time.  i couldn't hold someones hand while they blew up their life.  Eventually he got on meds and is rebuilding his life but he really screwed it up.\n\n Im deep in my head right now with my PTSD from fleeing the  abusive relationship mentioned above (actively working on it in therapy) and as such if someone came to me and said they were struggling, depending on the day i wouldnt be able to help. Some days I struggle to even get out of bed and shower and brush my teeth. But it doesn't sound like the girlfriend is going through her own trauma/mental illness crisis, but is just being selfish.

He absolutely can get a friend to eat pizza and watch a game (they can watch stuff at the same time while on the phone to each other if they live physically too far apart), or go out to this week's big movie, or just go to a library lecture or community center program to see other people without \"being vulnerable\" in front of someone. (Not sarcasm quote, just directly quoting what he said was his reason for rejecting all his friends and family as people to be around.) If he absolutely can't be around strangers, he can whip out the book or movie or Spotify playlist or YouTube channel or family recipe that helps him feel the feelings he needs to feel right now.

If would recommend to stop and deeply think, when he is not grieving as hard and is more clear headed, whether or not this woman has created a pattern of selfish behavior, and then he must decide if she is worth staying together with even knowing she won't support him in his time of need. I personally would leave. I said whem he is clear headed because it is easy to make a decision in the heat of the moment and then feel regret after the fact that the action was made. OP needs to decide for himself what behavior he will and won't tolerate, and decide to leave of his own will if that's what he comes to. Right now I think he's stuck in a sunk cost fallacy. My therapist said that if you make a relationship decision based on what other people say and not what you feel that you will have more regrets and be more likely to go back to an unhealthy relationship, thinking you can \"fix\" things.", "I was thinking the exact same thing about him having a roommate and not a partner, but then I remembered the time my roommate drove me 300 miles one way to be with my family after my grandmother died and my car was getting its engine replaced.

She wasn't balling or hysterical, but, I could tell she was grieving.  She added that her dad was having a much harder time, though, as it was his older brother (both late 70s/early 80s while my wife, now 45, and me, 42).

That's not the time to reset support expectations and boundaries.", "Because he says he does not want to confide in any family or friends? So she is literally the only person supporting him", ">Any therapist will tell you that relying on only one support person is a setup for disaster. You become emotionally dependent on one person, and they become overwhelmed being the sole source of support. \n\nI would be more compelled to agree with this if this were a chronic issue, but the death happened last week. Again, to your defense (please note I hold this defense throughout the remainder of my response) you are right, it isn't healthy to use your partner as an emotional crutch, but I don't think that's what's happening here. If OP were available we could ask when the death occurred, but if OPs gf kept her usual schedule then she likely went out on Saturday to be with her friends, but to be fair until OP chimes in that is only supposition. For the sake of argument, if she did go out Saturday it's not like she hasn't been without her own support for an extended period of time. \n\n>His hang-ups around friends are his responsibility alone.\n\nOne could argue the gfs mental health was her own problem and didn't need OP to support her as her \"rock\" not just once, but multiple times. You don't just say you were someone's rock without the implication being they relied on you heavily to build themselves up. That is just by definition being the \"rock\". If she didn't have friends or her own family to lean on for her own mental health, why did OP feel compelled to provide that support when they aren't his problems? It's just the right thing to do for your partner. \n\n>men need to start emotionally supporting each other instead of seeking emotional support from female partners only\n\nCompletely irrelevant to this conversation, and you're assuming OP has hang ups with his masculinity to talk to other people about his current situations. Also, I don't know where you're getting that men lean on their female partners for emotional support. If you're going off of what society \"says\", men usually bottle up their emotions and then take them out on their partners. Women also judge men on expressing themselves emotionally which is why stereotypically men don't feel like they can open up at all to anyone, but again this gender argument has zero bearing on this conversation. \n\n>I feel like you are assuming the gf is giving zero support instead of realizing that she's with him more than half her nights, and it's very likely she's offering a lot of support in that time.\n\nI do not believe I ever made an argument of the quality of the support provided, nor do I assume the quality of support that this partner is giving much less that she isn't giving any at all. But again, considering this death was a week ago i do not feel it unreasonable for OP to request for her staying home. I am fully aware she spends most of her time at home with him, but why is that relevant to him asking for an extra night or 2. My wife spends most of her time with me, would I feel any less hurt if I told her I needed her for a couple extra nights to heal from a loss? I think not. \n\n>Dwelling in grief all the time doesn't help either. It's not that hard to say \"I'm sad because someone died. Want to play video games so I don't think about it?\"\n\nBut why can't she do that for him? You're assuming that he is just talking about it nonstop and it's bringing her mental state down. Is it not as possible just her presence there is being supportive and healing? \n\n>As for therapy, if a paid professional is out of reach, free grief support groups are plentiful. He could seek out an in person support group or find one online.\n\nThat's fair, you are correct in that. \n\n>I feel like you are assuming the gf is giving zero support\n\nI never assumed that, I think she is not taking full consideration of the impact of her decision by leaving when he asked her to stay so soon after the death. I'm sure she does what she can when she is there to support him. \n\n>OP hasn't mentioned anything about her being mean, cold, or ignoring him. His only complaint is that she didn't skip a 2nd social commitment in a row. We don't even know the details on that commitment, if she's feeling burnt out, or if there'd be fallout from her canceling her plans.\n\nOkay, that's great that she isn't being a complete asshole about it. I didn't interpret that at all, his complaint is by her not staying home a second night this made him feel secondary to maintaining her meet up and ultimately feeling like not a priority. Then why not say those things? If she is feeling those feelings then why not be upfront about her feelings, and give him the grace to know that he isn't being made second to her friends but she needs time to recharge. If she can't be honest and open as to why she can't cancel then that seems to point to bigger issues than just this incident. \n\n>He stated that he's been there for her in the past, not that he was her ONLY source of support. We don't have enough context to know the volume of support each has offered the other in the past. He also stated that she went through a difficult time before having her social groups and time, so we know they are integral to her life balance. You can't fill from an empty cup, and the BEST way to be a good support person for someone else is to make sure you're taking care of yourself first. It's difficult to live with someone who is grieving and depressed, too.\n\nI am just going to quote this whole paragraph. You're right, we don't know if he was the only one and we don't know the extent of their relationship. The volume and quality of the support in the past does not excuse the fact that he asked her to just stay one more night in this moment. If you dealt with someone's grief for a month, do you expect them to carry your grief for a month as well? Relationships aren't always equivocal, but the act of putting any amount of time aside to be there for your partner is what is a core tenant to being a good partner. To be fair it isn't necessarily right for OP to ask his gf to cancel a second time with short notice, but these are extraordinary circumstances so while it may not be right it is understandable for him to make the request. It's not like he is asking her to cut them out of her life altogether to focus solely on him, he is asking because he wants her support for one more night. I agree that you can't fill from an empty cup, but would it hurt her to make the effort for one more night? If her friends disapprove of her being there for her partner after a family death then what does that say about her support group? I know how hard it is, I've done it and I've always put my partner first no matter the reason. Being a good partner sometimes means doing things you don't want to and making sacrifices to show you care. \n\n>NAH, but there needs to be healthy communication, and everyone's needs are important.\n\nI agree with the communication aspect of this last sentence. I agree everyone's needs are important, but if everyone's needs are important then none of them are important.

That is just the Hallmark of a mature and supportive person.", "Exactly, everyone in the comments is forgetting the gf is not socialising the rest of the days of the week and we're assuming she is supporting her bf (OP) in this time. Having 1 or 2 nights to herself might be the only way she can handle burden the grief laid on her shoulders by OP. It could be unhealthy for gf to have 5 days straight of giving support to her bf.

My cousin died young and it fucked me up so bad for like years and was the first time in my life I experienced depression. My isolation from my family and being a new place made it worse. He asked for some extra support for a brief time. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what OP\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s needs are here, what we do know is that she is not able to provide very simple emotional support to OP in a time of great need. OP does deserve that from a partner and if she can\u2019t give that to him, he should think about if that\u2019s alright by him long term.", "Are you calling a man grieving the sudden loss of a 21 year old family member asking for *two days* of company an \"emotional vampire\"? Lmao, how do you people make it in the real world? I'm guessing you don't, actually. You've certainly never cared for anyone but yourself, anyway.", "Congratulations on being super human strong. Are you looking for a medal to something?\n\nPick mes are intolerable.", "I've also noticed there are a lot of women on this sub", ">He said that he's uncomfortable being vulnerable about his grief with friends\n\nSo his gf is the sole source of emotional support in this situation then? Yes, that's the problem. That's an extremely heavy burden to put on a single human. It is not fair to \"dump out\" on one person, he needs to go talk to his friends.", "If a week of not socializing with friends they see all the time during an incredibly difficult time in their partner's life is going to derail them so badly that they have a breakdown then they maybe shouldn't be in a serious relationship, especially when their partner has been there for them in the past and now they can't be bothered to return the favor.", "I missed the 6 years of relationship part. \n\nHow is she, after 6 years together, not grieving alongside him?! When my partner's teen cousin passed I was sobbing right alongside him. There are times to prioritise your own mental health but this isn't it. Whatever 'detriment' two nights in does to her is nothing compared to the benefit to OP and their relationship.", "My ex pulled something similar to this when my dad had a damn near fatal heart attack (and who was touch and go for a while). In that moment I felt completely abandoned and I saw a very ugly side of him that I couldn\u2019t unsee. I couldn\u2019t trust him to be there for me when I needed him because his needs always came before my requests for support. I gave him so much support all the time and I realized that I wasn\u2019t getting an even exchange of my needs being met.\n\nI don\u2019t see them coming back from this", "Best response for me. The reference to your own trauma is a great example of when turning someone down in time of help is okay.", "I once drove seven hours (plus seven hours back) to help pick up and comfort a graduate student who had been out in the field with her advisor when he suddenly died, and we were just *officemates*. I didn't even hesitate when my advisor called to ask if I'd be willing to do it.", "People are really harping on this \"single person\" thing. Look, that's a problem if he does it for EVERYTHING. The friend thing is absolutely a problem, but it sounds like he doesn't want to lean on family right now because they're also grieving and can't hold him up. I really, really, really disagree we can extrapolate based on this ONE extreme situation that he expects her to be his sole support all of the time."]}
