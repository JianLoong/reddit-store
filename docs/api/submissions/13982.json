Hi reddit, I'm in a pickle.\n\nLast week, my (29m) younger cousin (21m) passed away unexpectedly. It came as a huge shock and has taken a massive toll on my family. In the meantime, I have been there for my family and other younger cousins to support them.\n\nI thought I was doing okay and shielded myself and others thinking my emotions were in check. Though, I've come to realise I'm not fine at all. I feel utterly sad, lonely and anxious. These feelings are exacerbated when I'm alone.\n\nMy partner (26f) socialises every Monday and Tuesday night, and all day Saturday. For context, she has a real sense of community through this and a great group of friends. This is something she has lacked before and gets a real mental health boost from this. I love seeing her so happy.\n\nSo I mentioned to her yesterday that I was struggling and that being alone made it worse. I asked if she would stay in the house to be with me yesterday night and tonight.\n\nShe agreed to yesterday but not tonight. She cited her need to look after her own mental health. She has suggested I speak to my family or friends. The truth is, I don't want to burden my family, who are hurting, and I don't have any friends who I'd feel comfortable being vulnerable with. So she offered alternative solutions but I find the most comfort in her.\n\nWhy I'm upset about this is because I've supported her in the past and been her rock in times of need. Yet, in my time of need, I am not seemingly a priority. Today, I've communicated with her as if everything's cool and okay; but, really, I'm disappointed and feel this isn't how to treat a partner of six years going through a tough period.\n\nReddit, AITA?

This is what partnership is about, it's a give and take and sometimes we need more than we can give. You asked for help, because you need help. Please don't ever let yourself believe asking for help when you need it makes you in any way shape or form an a-hole. My husband has been struggling with anxiety this year, and has asked me this many times. I did have the conversation eventually that I can't stay home all the time/what is best for me, but not until it had truly become a routine request. This is a period of pain and grief, and you're allowed to ask things of your partner that sometimes require sacrifice. You don't have to be strong all the time friend. Sending you love.", "NTA...Your ask is simply not large enough for me to see it any other way.", "Definitely NTA. You are asking for very little time with her and she can\u2019t clear her social schedule during your time of need and grief? You\u2019re right, you\u2019re not a priority and I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA\n\nDon't hide how you feel from her. It will only build resentment. Talk to her.

Your wife might be feeling stressed that you're relying only on her.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I would be upset too. Idk if its because i cant see myself socializing thst much in a week more than necessary but to me she can afford to stay for that week and just accompang you.

I understand her need to look after her own mental health and I firmly believe in the \"a girlfriend is not a pacifier\" principle. But you're not in a normal situation, and you're not asking her to do this as a regular thing. You've lost somebody important to you, and you're asking for a couple of days. That's well within reason, and I think she should be supporting you that far, unless there's an important factor we aren't hearing or something.", "NTA - definitely not the AH for asking. Nor hoping for consideration.", "NTA I am \ud83d\udcaf for someone taking care of themselves. Truly. You asked for one night. I mean, you didn\u2019t say remove yourself from your circle.

But I don\u2019t think staying in 1 night is going to have any negative effect on her. \n\nYou need to have an open discussion with her about how you feel. Don\u2019t keep anything in. \n\nyou may feel like talking to your family might burden them. But they know exactly what you\u2019re going through and would understand. \nYou can grieve together.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d also be questioning your girlfriends reaction to you needing help. Is this how all future issues will be dealt with?", "NTA. She\u2019s pretty selfish and now you know you\u2019re not her priority and can\u2019t count on her in a moment of need. I would break up with her.", "NTA that was a perfectly reasonable and normal ask of a partner, when faced with tragedy and shock.  You didn't ask her to give up her socializing permanently, you asked for 2 days.  That's fair.  Her not giving that to you is very cold, IMO.", "NTA but dude, you don\u2019t want to burden others with your feelings so you bottle them up? Talk to your family. They miss your cousin too and there\u2019s comfort in shared memories.\n\nAnd seek some therapy for yourself - you\u2019re viewing your emotions as a burden that you put on other people. \n1. That\u2019s not healthy for you. \n2. That\u2019s not healthy for your partner (I mean in general, I\u2019m not siding with your GF here). If you had a partner who was supportive the way you are, they still can\u2019t be your only emotional outlet or support. \n\nThey can and should be your main one, sure. But not your only one. So you need to get more comfortable talking to others and find some emotional outlets outside your relationship. This is unrelated to Your (current) GF as her response sucks.", "NTA, You do need support but not wanting to burden your family just means you want to place all responsibility on your partner and that\u2019s not fair either. You might find that talking with your family is super helpful and cathartic because they knew your cousin and can share in your grief. Your grief isn\u2019t a burden btw. It\u2019s ok to ask for support when you need it. Your feelings are valid.\n\nThat said, her taking a few days out from socializing to focus on you shouldn\u2019t detract from her mental health. She is coming off pretty selfish here. You should tell her how it makes you feel that she isn\u2019t willing to be supportive during a really hard time. Her reaction will be really telling.", "You are most certainly NTA. She sounds very dismissive, selfish, and quite honestly, cruel. \n\nYou are going through a traumatic experience, and a good partner would SUPPORT their significant other. You verbalized you need support and how she can give it. She refused and prioritized herself.\n\nMy advice is to bail while you can. When things get tough, partners truly reveal themselves. This is a red flag of epic proportions.", "NTA if staying with your SO is a mental health risk, they shouldnt be your SO", "NTA\n\nThere are women out there who actually care about and support their partners btw OP. This girl isn't all that, you can do better.", "Nta", "People\u2019s responses to grief are so weird. NTA, OP! That was a reasonable request. I could see her wanting a night out if she had been staying in with you for weeks after your loss, but not from 1 night.", "You should tell her exactly what you put in this post. In a nice way. If she still holds her ground, and is unwilling to compromise, you may need to reevaluate. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour partner of 6 years is showing you where you stand.  You are not a priority to her when it inconveniences her.  That is a red flag.  I'd have a serious sit down conversation with her about it.", "She\u2019s selfish, mate. She\u2019s showing you her true colors. Staying in with you for a couple of nights isn\u2019t going to do anything bad for her mental health. She just chooses herself over you. Having a good time is more important to her than supporting her partner during a difficult period. \n\nCut her loose, mate. She ain\u2019t the one.", "First, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nI'm going with NTA, with a little N A H and I'll go into why.\n\nFirst, I don't think that asking for two nights is unreasonable, especially when this death JUST happened. I worry what your partner believes the state of her mental health is and how fragile it must be that she thinks missing two nights is going to have a massive effect on her.\n\nHowever, her mental health is going to come in to play as you process your grief. I'm 14 months into grieving the death of my mom. Like you, I am the stoic one in my family. I haven't cried in front of my dad. I keep things under control so as to be his support. \n\nMy partner, however, sees *everything* and has had to be my support. This has put a major strain on him and on our relationship.\n\nGrief takes a massive toll not only on us but also on those around us. Because we feel emotional safety with our partners, sometimes it can be easy to forget that they do have to actually maintain their own mental health first in order to be there for us.\n\nAgain, I went with NTA because I don't think two nights is unreasonable at all, especially so close to the death. It's true she'll need to keep up her mental health, but you're not even in the thick of it yet.\n\n(Also I found this and the book it came from helpful in understanding my grief and asking for support. The PDF is to the folks in your life who may not understand what you're going through: https://refugeingrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/grieving-friend-essay-PDF.pdf)", "NTA. You're grieving and feeling isolated, and, because it was a sudden shock to your whole family, you feel you don't have a support system outside of your partner. It's totally reasonable that you'd want her to prioritize you during this difficult time.\n\nHowever, I wonder if your attitude toward not wanting to burden anyone, and communicating with your partner now \"as if everything's cool and okay\" is leading her to believe your emotional needs aren't really as serious as you know they are. She may feel that she's meeting you halfway, when you know you need more than that.\n\nIs there a chance you'd be willing to leave the house and participate in an activity with her? Not with her group of friends, but just the two of you? You might find it beneficial to get out of the house regardless (from personal experience, I know that stewing in your grief at home can make that loneliness worse), and then she would also feel that you're meeting her halfway with HER emotional needs as well.\n\nEither way, I think pretending everything is fine will probably give her the wrong impression, and she'll be less likely to understand how much you're hurting. If you haven't already, you definitely need to have a serious, sit-down conversation about how you're feeling, how all this is affecting you, and what, specifically, she could do to help you feel less alone.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I hope the coming days and weeks bring peace for you and your family.", "I'm wondering if she's committed to you or her social life. Seems like you've been there for her but she can't return the favor.", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable for you to ask and she should be there for you. She can\u2019t miss a couple of days? What\u2019s going on there that\u2019s more important to her.", "NTA. And if you are thinking of marrying this person, remember, she can't be there for you for a few days, 'for worse'.", "Info: what is her socialization? Is it a commitment that she has made? \n\nInfo 2: is she your only support system? As someone who feels others pain, I do recognize the strain that it puts on me. If she socializes 3 times a week, she\u2019s already said she\u2019ll stay home once - that means 5 days of emotional support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Speaking for myself and fully aware that this not true for everyone and every situation, I think that it could help if you face your pain more. When it comes, don't run from it, deal with it. Maybe you want to write your cousin a letter, telling him how much you miss him and what you appreciated about him. Or paint. Build something. But don't distract yourself.

Although it was the start of a long journey that hasn't ended yet, my general outview on life brightened, when I began to deal with the pain. What I'm trying to say: If you really want to cry, in that moment it feels bad and if you push it away, you avoid the pain in the moment. But if you let yourself deeply feel that pain and cry, after the tears stopped, the heart becomes much lighter again. Probably there will be another wave of pain, but if go through it, expressing it in any way, the pain dissolves. If you push it constantly away, the pain is just hidden under the surface.\n\nIf you read that, I hope it helps you.

OP is in a fog right now and can't advocate for how much his partner's regular socializing helps her own emotional health right now. The grief of a partner is an expected burden to bear but does cost emotional energy. He does know her socializing a critical part of her emotional health. That said, one singular night off from 2 regular meetings is not an unreasonable request. OP seems to be in a bit of a crisis and needs some immediate emotional support, and IMO his request for 2 days comes from a place of good emotional intelligence. \n\nIt saddens me to see other comments jumping to her being an AH as if she hasn't proven to have underlying struggles with her own mental health. IMO she should give this friend night to her partner, but she's not a hard AH for advocating for her own mental health: to me it mainly reads as she's anxious about the negative impact that giving up that night might have. If I was her friend I'd gently encourage her to try it for her partners sake, and her outcome may pleasantly surprise her and give her confidence in her progress.\n\nYou said something similar in your comment: this is going to be a marathon, not a sprint.

Also, OP, you mentioned feeling drained by being there for the rest of your family. Please remember you are also grieving and your mental health matters too.

Please keep an eye on what else you need as you try to support your family.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "Info 2 is important. If she's utilizing her friend system as emotional support, in addition to him, then that's less of a burden on him. If he won't utilize his friend system for emotional support, then he's putting more of a burden on her. That's an unfair imbalance. \n\nPeople are calling her selfish for not giving 2 days of support. That's not correct. She's simply not sacrificing more that 1 day of her own support.
