Hi reddit, I'm in a pickle.\n\nLast week, my (29m) younger cousin (21m) passed away unexpectedly. It came as a huge shock and has taken a massive toll on my family. In the meantime, I have been there for my family and other younger cousins to support them.\n\nI thought I was doing okay and shielded myself and others thinking my emotions were in check. Though, I've come to realise I'm not fine at all. I feel utterly sad, lonely and anxious. These feelings are exacerbated when I'm alone.\n\nMy partner (26f) socialises every Monday and Tuesday night, and all day Saturday. For context, she has a real sense of community through this and a great group of friends. This is something she has lacked before and gets a real mental health boost from this. I love seeing her so happy.\n\nSo I mentioned to her yesterday that I was struggling and that being alone made it worse. I asked if she would stay in the house to be with me yesterday night and tonight.\n\nShe agreed to yesterday but not tonight. She cited her need to look after her own mental health. She has suggested I speak to my family or friends. The truth is, I don't want to burden my family, who are hurting, and I don't have any friends who I'd feel comfortable being vulnerable with. So she offered alternative solutions but I find the most comfort in her.\n\nWhy I'm upset about this is because I've supported her in the past and been her rock in times of need. Yet, in my time of need, I am not seemingly a priority. Today, I've communicated with her as if everything's cool and okay; but, really, I'm disappointed and feel this isn't how to treat a partner of six years going through a tough period.\n\nReddit, AITA?

This is what partnership is about, it's a give and take and sometimes we need more than we can give. You asked for help, because you need help. Please don't ever let yourself believe asking for help when you need it makes you in any way shape or form an a-hole. My husband has been struggling with anxiety this year, and has asked me this many times. I did have the conversation eventually that I can't stay home all the time/what is best for me, but not until it had truly become a routine request. This is a period of pain and grief, and you're allowed to ask things of your partner that sometimes require sacrifice. You don't have to be strong all the time friend. Sending you love.", "NTA...Your ask is simply not large enough for me to see it any other way.", "Definitely NTA. You are asking for very little time with her and she can\u2019t clear her social schedule during your time of need and grief? You\u2019re right, you\u2019re not a priority and I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA\n\nDon't hide how you feel from her. It will only build resentment. Talk to her. I feel like she could be there for you during this tough time. I know you feel best with your spouse, but you could also lean on your family and friends. Your wife might be feeling stressed that you're relying only on her.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I would be upset too. Idk if its because i cant see myself socializing thst much in a week more than necessary but to me she can afford to stay for that week and just accompang you. It's not like youre asking her to do it for months.\n\nShe can get back to her routine the following week.", "NTA. I\u2019d want to be around people I love too.

I understand her need to look after her own mental health and I firmly believe in the \"a girlfriend is not a pacifier\" principle. But you're not in a normal situation, and you're not asking her to do this as a regular thing. You've lost somebody important to you, and you're asking for a couple of days. That's well within reason, and I think she should be supporting you that far, unless there's an important factor we aren't hearing or something.", "NTA - definitely not the AH for asking. Nor hoping for consideration.", "NTA I am \ud83d\udcaf for someone taking care of themselves. Truly. You asked for one night. I mean, you didn\u2019t say remove yourself from your circle.

You\u2019ve asked for 2 nights. Partners should support each other.  I understand wanting to take care of her own mental health. But I don\u2019t think staying in 1 night is going to have any negative effect on her. \n\nYou need to have an open discussion with her about how you feel. Don\u2019t keep anything in. \n\nyou may feel like talking to your family might burden them. But they know exactly what you\u2019re going through and would understand. \nYou can grieve together.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d also be questioning your girlfriends reaction to you needing help. Is this how all future issues will be dealt with?", "NTA. She\u2019s pretty selfish and now you know you\u2019re not her priority and can\u2019t count on her in a moment of need. I would break up with her.", "NTA that was a perfectly reasonable and normal ask of a partner, when faced with tragedy and shock.  You didn't ask her to give up her socializing permanently, you asked for 2 days.  That's fair.  Her not giving that to you is very cold, IMO.", "NTA but dude, you don\u2019t want to burden others with your feelings so you bottle them up? Talk to your family. They miss your cousin too and there\u2019s comfort in shared memories.\n\nAnd seek some therapy for yourself - you\u2019re viewing your emotions as a burden that you put on other people. \n1. That\u2019s not healthy for you. \n2. That\u2019s not healthy for your partner (I mean in general, I\u2019m not siding with your GF here). If you had a partner who was supportive the way you are, they still can\u2019t be your only emotional outlet or support. \n\nThey can and should be your main one, sure. But not your only one. So you need to get more comfortable talking to others and find some emotional outlets outside your relationship. This is unrelated to Your (current) GF as her response sucks.", "NTA, You do need support but not wanting to burden your family just means you want to place all responsibility on your partner and that\u2019s not fair either. You might find that talking with your family is super helpful and cathartic because they knew your cousin and can share in your grief. Your grief isn\u2019t a burden btw. It\u2019s ok to ask for support when you need it. Your feelings are valid.\n\nThat said, her taking a few days out from socializing to focus on you shouldn\u2019t detract from her mental health. She is coming off pretty selfish here. You should tell her how it makes you feel that she isn\u2019t willing to be supportive during a really hard time. Her reaction will be really telling.", "You are most certainly NTA. She sounds very dismissive, selfish, and quite honestly, cruel. \n\nYou are going through a traumatic experience, and a good partner would SUPPORT their significant other. You verbalized you need support and how she can give it. She refused and prioritized herself.\n\nMy advice is to bail while you can. When things get tough, partners truly reveal themselves. This is a red flag of epic proportions.", "NTA if staying with your SO is a mental health risk, they shouldnt be your SO", "NTA\n\nThere are women out there who actually care about and support their partners btw OP. This girl isn't all that, you can do better.", "Nta", "People\u2019s responses to grief are so weird. NTA, OP! That was a reasonable request. I could see her wanting a night out if she had been staying in with you for weeks after your loss, but not from 1 night.", "You should tell her exactly what you put in this post. In a nice way. If she still holds her ground, and is unwilling to compromise, you may need to reevaluate. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour partner of 6 years is showing you where you stand.  You are not a priority to her when it inconveniences her.  That is a red flag.  I'd have a serious sit down conversation with her about it.", "She\u2019s selfish, mate. She\u2019s showing you her true colors. Staying in with you for a couple of nights isn\u2019t going to do anything bad for her mental health. She just chooses herself over you. Having a good time is more important to her than supporting her partner during a difficult period. \n\nCut her loose, mate. She ain\u2019t the one.", "First, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nI'm going with NTA, with a little N A H and I'll go into why.\n\nFirst, I don't think that asking for two nights is unreasonable, especially when this death JUST happened. I worry what your partner believes the state of her mental health is and how fragile it must be that she thinks missing two nights is going to have a massive effect on her.\n\nHowever, her mental health is going to come in to play as you process your grief. I'm 14 months into grieving the death of my mom. Like you, I am the stoic one in my family. I haven't cried in front of my dad. I keep things under control so as to be his support. \n\nMy partner, however, sees *everything* and has had to be my support. This has put a major strain on him and on our relationship.\n\nGrief takes a massive toll not only on us but also on those around us. Because we feel emotional safety with our partners, sometimes it can be easy to forget that they do have to actually maintain their own mental health first in order to be there for us.\n\nAgain, I went with NTA because I don't think two nights is unreasonable at all, especially so close to the death. It's true she'll need to keep up her mental health, but you're not even in the thick of it yet.\n\n(Also I found this and the book it came from helpful in understanding my grief and asking for support. The PDF is to the folks in your life who may not understand what you're going through: https://refugeingrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/grieving-friend-essay-PDF.pdf)", "NTA. You're grieving and feeling isolated, and, because it was a sudden shock to your whole family, you feel you don't have a support system outside of your partner. It's totally reasonable that you'd want her to prioritize you during this difficult time.\n\nHowever, I wonder if your attitude toward not wanting to burden anyone, and communicating with your partner now \"as if everything's cool and okay\" is leading her to believe your emotional needs aren't really as serious as you know they are. She may feel that she's meeting you halfway, when you know you need more than that.\n\nIs there a chance you'd be willing to leave the house and participate in an activity with her? Not with her group of friends, but just the two of you? You might find it beneficial to get out of the house regardless (from personal experience, I know that stewing in your grief at home can make that loneliness worse), and then she would also feel that you're meeting her halfway with HER emotional needs as well.\n\nEither way, I think pretending everything is fine will probably give her the wrong impression, and she'll be less likely to understand how much you're hurting. If you haven't already, you definitely need to have a serious, sit-down conversation about how you're feeling, how all this is affecting you, and what, specifically, she could do to help you feel less alone.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I hope the coming days and weeks bring peace for you and your family.", "I'm wondering if she's committed to you or her social life. Seems like you've been there for her but she can't return the favor.", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable for you to ask and she should be there for you. She can\u2019t miss a couple of days? What\u2019s going on there that\u2019s more important to her.", "NTA. And if you are thinking of marrying this person, remember, she can't be there for you for a few days, 'for worse'.", "Info: what is her socialization? Is it a commitment that she has made? \n\nInfo 2: is she your only support system? As someone who feels others pain, I do recognize the strain that it puts on me. If she socializes 3 times a week, she\u2019s already said she\u2019ll stay home once - that means 5 days of emotional support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its not like you have been wallowing in misery for months and demanding that she drop everything she is doing for you.\n\nIm really sorry for your loss, hope you and your family are doing alright.", "NTA, that is very selfish of her.  Do you ever get invited to these things that take up multiple days a week?  What is going on there that it is more of a priority for her than you?", "NTA. You asked her to stay home with you for 2 nights not 2 years. Has she not experienced a close loss before? My ex didn't understand my feelings of grief regarding my grandfather, he actually said stuff like \"People in Africa are suffering a lot more than you.\" He apologised for that after he lost his Grandfather about 2 years later.", "Think if this is the person you\u2019re want to spend the rest of your life with, she\u2019s taking a \u201cmental health day\u201d when you\u2019re the one who needs those\u2026", "She is a selfish partner NTA. These types of people take from you as much as they can and they won\u2019t reciprocate", "NTA, and you\u2019re asking her for two nights, one week. You haven\u2019t asked her to give up two nights a week perpetually (I think).\nI\u2019m honestly curious about these friends also\u2026if I were out with friends and they found out my boyfriend was grieving from something so recent they\u2019d be flabbergasted I was picking them over him.", "While they go out and have fun, too. I\u2019m shaking my head. NTA!", "This! \u261d\ufe0f He asked for two nights. Honestly I\u2019m appalled that she wouldn\u2019t want to spend longer with him when he needs her. Why doesn\u2019t she need him? Your partner should be good for your mental health too.", "I cannot upvote more this comment unfortunately. But she is been selfish. Op ask for only 2 days\u2026 not even the entire day but just two nights. She is showing her true colors op. NTA at all.", "Maybe... or maybe she does have mental health issues and being OP's support system is more than she can handle right now. That seems to be what she is saying, so why shouldn't that be the case?", "This!!  I\u2019m sure it was difficult for OP to ask this of his partner (cause you know men are supposed to be strong at all times /s).  It\u2019s honestly appalling that a partner of many years would deny his reasonable request). \n\nOP I\u2019m sorry for your loss and your gf\u2019s lack of empathy.  You are NTA.", "I agree 100%. It's so little he's asking for, and IMO he shouldn't even have to ask at all! It sounds like OP has been supporting her a lot throughout their relationship and it makes me wonder if they perhaps now have this unhealthy dynamic where he's always the giver and she's the taker?", "To be fair, the OP asked for two nights.", "She doesn\u2019t seem like any of those things any more than OP seems likes like a manipulative clinger.", "Amen!", "Please, like her mental health would be so badly affected by staying home for two days. Two days!", "So you now can\u2019t ask a partner to support you for a few days after a loved one dies?   That is insane to me, if she can\u2019t be there for him then why stay together?", "They\u2019ve been together for 6 years as well, chances are gf might also be pretty upset about the sudden death of the cousin", "Put it all on her?   It\u2019s TWO DAYS he asked for support, how is that putting it on her?  They have been partner for 6 years, that\u2019s a basic level of need from your partner that she can\u2019t push through!", "She's still a massive AH though.\n\n\"Sorry cousin died last week OP, but Mondays are for girls night!\"", "But he is burdening his gf?", "It's 2 nights in with her bf, I think she will be fine.", "You know people can have jobs and still have time to social in the evening right?", "This is a wild take, do you not do things on weekday evenings?", "Do you... think that having a job precludes you from going out with friends during the week? This is such a wild take lmao.", "So, we found the person who's never been in a healthy relationship in their life. When you love someone, you want to help them. You're supposed to be able to talk to your loved ones when you're grieving. The GF clearly cares more about seeing her friends, than helping her partner through one of the hardest times of his life. The OP shouldn't need to go to therapy, just to have a shoulder to cry on for two days.", "Yea, it\u2019s not even an obligation or a work thing or something they couldn\u2019t miss!  It\u2019s a fun night out that they can\u2019t give up for two nights after a family tragedy?", "Those are her nights with her AP. Can\u2019t cancel those without\u2026questions.  \n\nHonestly talking out my ass, no real idea. But it does sound suspiciously freaking weird. \u201cMy mental health is sooo very important. But yea, go figure your own shit out hun\u201d", "He has been her rock when she needed. She cannot stay at home two night for him when he most need her. This is selfish no matter what.", "The audacity to ask for two nights with their significant other after a family member died. He should be ashamed. /s I don\u2019t even see the reason to point this out asking for two nights from your the person you\u2019re in a **relationship with** shouldn\u2019t be a big ask to anybody.", "You are right", "It's not just the staying home, it's the bearing someone else's trauma (which is appropriate for a partner). If she's not in the mental state to do that, then all that would happen is both people would be in the same boat. Sometimes your partner is just not the person that can provide that, and it's okay in a relationship.\n\nNAH", "I agree with both of you. OP please don\u2019t ask your partner to be your only source of support. That\u2019s too much to ask of anyone, especially someone who has their own mental health struggles. Your partner may be doing her own grieving, or this could have triggered something for her. If she\u2019s going to support you to the best of her ability, she has to make sure she\u2019s healthy herself. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m happy that you recognized and voiced that you need support. There are a lot of resources out there to help you through this. \n\nNAH", "Yeah - shared grief lightens the load. Grieving around someone who is not also grieving the same event is a burden to them. \n\nIts one partners should accept to the extent that they can, but it can be hard on them.", "[deleted]", "Then that makes her a terrible parter and the asshole.  Don\u2019t be in a relationship with a human being if you can\u2019t be there TWO DAYS after a loved one passes away.", "She is a terrible partner and a massive AH in this situation. She just wants to go to get fun while his 6 years old relationship partner is needing her for only two nights. That sounds selfish AF. NTA", "If that\u2019s the case, I hope she\u2019s getting professional help along with support from her friends.", "She literally won't miss 2 nights out to support him.\n\nIf he was asking for 3 weeks in a row or something then she has a point but he isn't?", "Or she\u2019s cheating and doesn\u2019t want to abandon her affair partner.", "[deleted]", "Stretch", "I mean even that sounds pretty harsh but yea at least some consideration for her long term partner would be great.\n\nRight now she's like \"sorry cousin died on Friday OP but Tuesday nights are girls night, see ya!\""]}
