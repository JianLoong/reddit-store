She is 9 months pregnant.\n\n On my birthdays, usually mum comes to my city (4 hours away) and celebrates with me, the only day of the year they can stand together. \n\nThis year, by coincidence, my father and mother were unable to travel to celebrate my birthday (my father for health reasons and my mother being extremely pregnant), but my father insisted that I go there once. \n\n\nMy birthday is this Thursday and I've been at my mother's house since Sunday. \n\nI always liked to go to a pizzeria in my mother's city and when she asked what I would like to do for my birthday, I said that I would like to go to this pizzeria. It's one of the more expensive ones, but my dad gave me money so my mom and I could go. \n\nToday, my mother came to talk to me asking if I could choose another option, as it would be extremely expensive for her husband and stepdaughter to go (Example fictitious value, they earn 4k together and it is 400 two people) and she would like us to have that moment in family, in addition to being complicated just the two of us going and leaving them at home. \n\nI was honestly and said that I don't want, because it's something I go a few times and I like it a lot (it makes up for it even though the price is high), besides I came to celebrate with HER and we can both go , if they can't go, I don't think it's fair to have to give up something I want for my birthday because of them. \n\nShe kept insisting to think about it and what it would be like to celebrate with everyone and I got irritated, saying that if she kept this up I would catch a bus tomorrow and go back to my dad's house. \n\nShe started crying and became a mess. Her accusing me of blackmailing emotional by threatening to leave and how petty/selfish I was being about a pizzeria when there are lots of other options in town cheaper. \n\nMum is not talking to me right now and her husband/daughter is criticizing me for making her stress in late on her pregnancy about something so futile. \n\nMy dad said I should give in and that whatever's left I'll keep for myself, but I think it's so unfair and I'm strongly considering leaving. \n\nAITA?\n\nDon't speak english so well..

Hmm. NTA", "NTA\n\nOP just go back to your dad and leave the drama behind.", "NTA\n\nYour dad gave you the money to cover you and your mom at the restaurant you wanted to go to.  Cost is not the real issue because that has been covered or offset by your dad.\n\nThe real issue is that your mom wants to invite additional people that you, the guest of honor, do not want to come.  People your dad did not cover because you don't want them there.  And THOSE people are the ones who cannot afford to go to the restaurant you chose.  There's nothing wrong with holding your ground here.\n\nYour mom can have a 1:1 birthday dinner with you without her husband and his child there.  There is no reason they need to come, and if they can't afford to come, then there's the answer right there.\n\nInsisting you change your birthday to accommodate people you don't want to invite is wrong.  Your mom shouldn't be forcing you to invite your step-family along to begin with, and she especially shouldn't be forcing you to choose a different restaurant so that they can come.  It's YOUR birthday.", "NTA, it\u2019s your birthday dinner in a place you love but rarely get to go to, why should you change it for her new family? You\u2019re there to celebrate with her, not them.", "NTA at all. Your mom lives 4 hours away so you obviously don\u2019t get much of a chance to go to this place you really like, and on a special occasion like your birthday you should absolutely be able to go where you want. Your mom is being an entitled asshole. There is no need for her partner and stepchild to attend. Again, it\u2019s your birthday and you are well within your rights to want some one on one time with your mom. As a mom myself I kind of can\u2019t believe she wouldn\u2019t want to spend that kind of quality time with you. She sucks. Being pregnant is not an excuse for being a selfish asshole. NTA, get the pizza solo, then get the F outta there ASAP.\n\nOh and happy birthday!!! \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA.\n\nYou want the birthday to be you and your mom, thats fair, especially since your dad is paying for it.", "NTA\n\nGo to the pizza place by yourself, catch the bus back to your dads, and then pocket the rest. It\u2019s your birthday. Go where you want to go. It sucks that it would be by yourself, but that\u2019s your mom\u2019s decision. \n\nYes, mom has other people to think about but it wasn\u2019t an issue before. When you were planning to go to you mom\u2019s that was the time for her to bring this up. Waiting until after you\u2019re there to try and trap you into the decision was not fair on your mom\u2019s part. She should have brought up wanting to do the group thing while discussing your visit. Not 3 days into the visit. You told her where you wanted to go and she came to you today to change it. \n\nI feel this was your mom\u2019s plan all along. Instead of springing her trap, this discussion should have been had before you got there. Since it\u2019s your birthday and something you don\u2019t get to do often I would say go alone and then go back home. Your dad is trying to keep the peace, but you shouldn\u2019t have to change the plan because your mom couldn\u2019t have this discussion beforehand. \n\nHappy early Birthday!", "NTA.  I think your mom misunderstood.  YOU invited her to dinner, not her husband or stepdaughter.  Just her.  If she doesn't want to go then she should just decline then she can go out to dinner with her husband and stepdaughter, but you didn't invite them and it is VERY RUDE to invite them as a guest to a dinner.", "NTA. \n\nI could be wrong, so correct me if so, but it seems you don't really spend a lot of time with your mom. I can understand her wanting to include your step sis and her husband, but at the same time, it's your birthday and a special occasion for when you see your mother. \n\nMaybe explain to her that you just want a nice dinner with just her as you don't really get alone time to be with her. If she's still not giving in, I would just go back home with your father and see if he'll celebrate your birthday with you at a place of your choosing. \n\nAs you get older, your birthday sort of loses its special-Ness, so enjoy it as a kid, because I can promise you, my birthday is just another day of the week in my life.", "NTA.\n\nJust hop on the bus and go back home!  Don\u2019t stay somewhere that seems toxic.\n\nYou went there to spend time with your mom.  If you don\u2019t want to spend your bday with her husband and his daughter that is fine.  I\u2019m not sure why your mom expects you to accommodate them on your special day.  If she wanted to celebrate your bday as a \u201cfamily\u201d then they could have arranged another dinner elsewhere on a different day.", "NTA.  Your stepfather and stepsister do not need to go.  It's not a complication that they can't go especially since your stepsister is 18.  The real problem here is your mother refuses to do anything with just you.  It's clear she doesn't see you as a priority and is putting your step-relations before you on the one day of the year that should be about you.    \n\n\nJust go home to your dad.  It's not emotional manipulation if you follow through on your ultimatums and pregnancy isn't an excuse to treat your kid like they are last place on their birthday.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry your mom is so selfish", "NTA - You are allowed to eat wherever you want to on your birthday and if people want to join you, they can. If they don\u2019t want to spend that money, they don\u2019t have to.  \n\nYou aren\u2019t forcing anyone to come. If they don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money at the restaurant then they can see you another time. Maybe at a cheaper place or even just pop over and see you. \n\nIf you were asking people to come it would be different. But you\u2019re not. If anything you\u2019d rather it was just you and her. \n\nNTA", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake the bus, go back. Your mom is an AH.", "NTA\n\nYou want to spend your birthday and time alone with your mom and that\u2019s ok. I would just go alone and then catch a way back to my dads. Idk how the relationship with mom would be after that but it would be no one\u2019s fault but her own. She can\u2019t force you to let them come. Your mom lives 4hrs away from you and she can\u2019t just take this one special day and leave her husband and stepchild at home?", "NTA. I say this as a \u201cchild of divorce\u201d as well as a parent. \n\nYour birthday tradition was disrupted. It\u2019s the one day of a year you get to talk to both of your parents at the same time. You already lost that opportunity this year. Your mom shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you into taking advantage of that to fulfill her wishes. Your dad gave you enough money for each of you. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t just get on a bus and leave; but I would try to talk to your mom alone and explain how you\u2019re feeling. If she still doesn\u2019t understand, you could choose somewhere cheaper and leave immediately after. Let her know you\u2019re disappointed and will acquiesce this time, but in the future you won\u2019t visit her on your birthday should similar circumstances arise. \n\nIn the grand scheme of your life, it\u2019s one disappointment that isn\u2019t worth extrapolating into a massive fight. That\u2019s what it\u2019ll become if you leave. Either that, or after the convo you could say you\u2019d rather celebrate with your father than stay to celebrate with them and you find it hurtful that she isn\u2019t considering your feelings and you\u2019re expected to change to consider hers. You needing to be the \u201cbigger person\u201d at 17 is laughable. Your mom should step up here. \n\nEither way, talk to your mom first again. Don\u2019t just leave.", "NTA.   Your mom sucks and is the one trying to blackmail you.  Go back to your dad\u2019s or better yet go by yourself to the pizzeria and keep the change!", "NTA. Go back to your hometown.", "NTA\n\nYour birthday should be celebrated at a place you would enjoy. Your birthday should not revolve around the wants of mom\u2019s new husband and his daughter.\n\nIt is actually pretty sad that your mom is pregnant again. She clearly isn\u2019t interested in the whole parenting gig.", "NTA. See if they will do a frozen or un-baked pizza for you and take it to your dad's if you can.\n\nLeave your mom's house either way.", "NTA you came to celebrate with her. She doesn\u2019t even have to pay because your dad gave you the money. It\u2019s your birthday it should be your choice.\n\nSince your mom isn\u2019t talking to you maybe it\u2019s time for you to go home.", "NTA - I'd try to explain to your mom one more time, that you wanted some time with only her, especially since her baby will come soon. You said the pizza place is expensive, so maybe if you point out you have the money as a special thing for just you and your mom - not the stepdad and stepdaughter - maybe she'll agree. Talk about wanting \"mom and me time\".\n\nIf she's insisting on step family being there or not going, rescind the invite. If you have friends in your mom's area, go out with one of them to the pizza place maybe the night before your birthday, and then go back to your dad's. Even if you end up going alone, you'll still have the experience of the restaurant and the food. \n\nAlso, have you talked to your dad about this situation? He might be able to get you a ride home or something (I'd say talk to your mom on your behalf but you said they don't get along). \n\nThe min thing I don't understand is *why* your mom is insisting on including your step family. is she afraid she's going to go into labor early or something like a health/safety issue? or is this her prioritizing her \"new\" family over you?", "Buy the cheapest take out pizza in town, and keep the money.\n\nNTA", "Info  do i read number right - 2 pizzas makes 10% of their whole family income?", "NAH. I understand it's your birthday, but they have another baby about to arrive. Obviously finances would be on their minds.
