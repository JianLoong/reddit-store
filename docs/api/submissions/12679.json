Which I'm fine with, since I live with him.  I just remind him to take walks and weigh himself daily, make sure he doesn't eat anything too terrible.\n\nBut for awhile now, there's been a thing where he refuses to get a larger package of anything from the store that he'll eat too much of-- desserts, snacks, etc.-- even if they're intended only for me.\n\nI get the logic behind it, but this has been going on for over a year now.  Sometimes I just want a specific flavor of ice cream we both like, but he refuses to get it because he's afraid he'll eat it all.\n\nSo I blew up at him last night when he asked me what was wrong after a heavy sigh.  No harsh words, but I, admittedly blunt and frustrated because I'm on spectrum and have a hard time being subtle and controlling tone, told him that I wish we could improve his relationship with food.\n\nI suggested he needs to find a way to just measure the stuff he wants to eat- scoops, handfuls, food scale- rather than sitting there eating the whole thing.  That he needs to learn self control.\n\nHe shot back with how restricting what's in the house is how Alcohol Anonymous handles problems, which is true.  But I told him straight up that I feel that's different, because unlike alcohol, food is necessary, and while a lot of the stuff I'm frustrated with is luxuries and niceties, I haven't had a lot of things like ice cream in months just because he'll proclaim he'll eat it all and we never buy it.\n\nI just feel frustrated, like he's not approaching the issue in a healthy way, and that restricting it is an easy way versus facing the real problem of learning to have a better relationship with food and being mindful of what and how much you eat.\n\nI genuinely had no issue with it at first, since he needed to lose weight, but sometimes it really feels like he does the bare minimum and skates on by, even with all my reminding and pushing.\n\nNot to discredit what he does do-- he weighs himself in the morning, and will take walks with a gentle reminder.\n\nI love him, I genuinely do, but I'm growing to be in a spot where I might have to separate myself from him before he suffers medical issues and I lose my mind.\n\nSo AITA for blowing up at him and immediately critiquing his reasons?\n\nEdit: Someone recommended I add that, due to circumstances, I have no access to a vehicle, so shopping by myself isn't really an option.", "created_utc": 1679234646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vm9wk/aita_for_growing_frustrated_with_my_partners/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, you are understandably frustrated by your SO's issues with food and the resulting limitations. That doesn't make you an AH, that just makes you human.\n\nEqually, he has realized where his strengths and weaknesses are. His weakness is in not being able to resist those foods when they are easily available, like they are when they're in the pantry. He has realized his strength is in not bringing those foods into the house at all. That's not being an AH, that's just playing to his strength in an attempt to improve his health.\n\nI don't think either of you are being AHs. I think you both need to be able to discuss this without getting angry at each other, because that's the only way you're going to find a solution. So you're going to have to work with him to find a time to have this discussion. When neither of you are annoyed at the other about this. There is probably a compromise that you can both live with.\n\nThat said, I suspect you're going to need to compromise more than him. And I suspect this because I personally have the same weakness, despite decades of trying to overcome it. It's easy to say just go to a nutritionist or a therapist, both of which I have done multiple times, and neither of which have worked. I know what works for me, and I've been fortunate enough that my family accommodates me.\n\nGood luck!", "Buy a cabinet with a lock from home depot or something and don't let him have a key and don't tell him what's in it.  If you've got room get an extra fridge and do the same.", "NTA \n\nHe needs to be in control of his weight loss and frankly I'm disturbed his medical team are making this your problem.", "YTA. You should never have agreed to be his personal trainer. I was a personal trainer but would have never trained my obese husband. I wasn\u2019t his mommy. This is so unhealthy. Get him a therapist that specializes in eating disorders. Actually. He needs to find a therapist. Not you. Seriously unhealthy dynamic.", "NTA This is not a fair position for you to be in. Are you supposed to never enjoy treats in your own home again?", "YTA. Not for being frustrated - your frustration is understandable - but for your lack of empathy and suggestion that he needs \"self-control\" as if it were something that he could (easily) learn.\n\nYou are on the spectrum, yet you have zero empathy for his situation. How? \"That he needs to learn self control.\" Seriously? How many times have people in your life told you that you need to learn something with the same implication - you know, one where it's set up like all you needed to do is just try harder and BOOM it would magically happen? I'm sure he'd **love** to have self-control, but if he *knows* he doesn't have it, then he is correct that he needs to eliminate the temptations.\n\nYou label this as an \"easy way out\" - as if there was **any** easy way to handle obesity and a major shift in diet. It's not an easy thing to do even if you don't have disordered eating tripping you up. Do some alcoholics in recovery find a way to successfully live in a house with alochol without relapsing? Sure. But some of them simple cannot, and those who do may find it a very difficult to do -- too difficult to take on early into their sobriety. They might be able to do it for a short time, then need the alcohol out of the house (or locked away) later. Someone with disordered eating/behavior eating issues is likely in a similar boat as someone dealing with an addiction.\n\nAlso, there are many ways for you to have ice cream without it tempting him. Get a lockbox for your ice cream, for example. Get a separate fridge. Make a section of the cabinents \"your\" cubby area, and setup a Ring camera (or whatever) to monitor it & stop him if he tries to eat anything there. It's 100% possible to have food in your home that he can't eat WITHOUT relying on him having better control over what he eats.\n\nWhile it sure sounds nice for him to develop a healthier relationship with food, that kind of thing can take **years** to develop. By your own account, he is already obese and has a crapton of work ahead of him related to losing fat and getting to a healthy weight. Does it make any sense to delay that process - possibly for years - in order for him to develop this more healthy relationship with food? I bet if you asked a doctor, they would say no.\n\nMe personally? I can't cook a batch of 20+ cookies \"for the week\" -- these will be eaten before anything else. Firstly, they are tasty. Secondly, they're super-easy/ready-to-eat. Knowing these truths about myself, I now get the cookie dough bucket thing that allows me to cook as few as 2 cookies at a time. If I want a cookie, I need at least 20 minutes to cook it. Now it's no longer an immediate/ready-to-eat food in my kitchen, and therefore I'm far more likely to go for the banana or orange as part of my breakfast.\n\nYou should also look into the kitchen safes. They're time locked, so you can get something out of them, but it then locks for X amount of hours. If your SO simply sits and eats a whole contianer of something, then it may not help--but if you go to a place like BJs or Sam's Club and can get large sets of smaller serving sizes (e.g., single serve bag of chips), a time safe can help with forming healthy habits -- he gets one bag of chips or popcorn or whatever, then he's locked out from the next bagfor 4-6 hours.\n\nNo matter what, this process is going to take years. So you need to find ways to keep the luxury foods you want without risking him eating it. If you can't do that, then you need to live separately or breakup.", ">But I told him straight up that I feel that's different, because unlike alcohol, food is necessary, and while a lot of the stuff I'm frustrated with is luxuries and niceties, I haven't had a lot of things like ice cream in months just because he'll proclaim he'll eat it all and we never buy it.\n\nYTA. Just because you feel like alcohol is different doesn\u2019t mean it is. He is very clearly telling you he has an addiction to food and is doing the only thing he knows how to do to prevent himself from binge eating.  Instead of supporting him and encouraging to get therapy for a very real addiction issue, you blew up at him because you can\u2019t have ice cream in the house. Food addiction is very real. Get Dairy Queen on your way home from work or something. You both should attend therapy on your own and as a couple.", "NAH. Youre both frustrated at the situation, not really at each other. \n\nI feel for you but I'm also someone who can't have certain foods in the house because I'll eat it all so I feel for him too. Thing is that it's just as frustrating for me. Luckily I live alone so there's no one else to worry about, but when I really want some ice cream I have to go to a fast food place or corner store to get it. \n\nMy life would be so much easier if I could get a handle on portion control, but when I try and fail I feel so much worse. But I do understand the feeling of wanting to just have something at home so it's there when you want it. \n\nMaybe get a lock box for the freezer or a locking mini fridge? It's not perfect but it does allow you to have more of the treats you want. Your best bet is to sit down and talk this out a little better because really you're both right, but you're both going to have to work to make this work.", "I lost 150lbs. My relationship with peanut butter and chocolate used to be like his \"addiction\". I didn't want any in the house. (I 54f am my mother's (88) full-time caregiver, so of course, I buy what she wants.) To this day, I still fear a tiny bit that if I take one bite, I'll eat the whole thing, even though I eat both occasionally. That said, I was able to work through that on my own. I genuinely feel that your husband needs therapy. NTA", "NTA \n\nHe needs to address his food issues because it\u2019s affecting both of you.

Honestly, I know it\u2019s not ideal, but if you could get your own little mini fridge / bar fridge with a lock on it for your snacks. It\u2019s not fixing the issue but you won\u2019t have to hide food or anything from him.", "YTA- I get your frustrations but him limiting portions before they ever come into the house is a viable method for weight loss. \n\nHe\u2019s essentially trying to save his own life and you\u2019re worried that you can\u2019t buy bulk of your favorite goodies. If it were me, I\u2019d apologize and explain the frustration you\u2019re having. See if you two can come up with a conflict resolution.\n\nAs for his relationship with food, I do think it would be beneficial for him to work with a therapist and a real nutritionist. They can help give him the tools to help him with his food addiction.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. When I read the title, I was expecting myself to have the opposite opinion, but you really are being supportive. You're also right that he needs to figure out better ways of dealing with his food issues. Has he seen a therapist to get to the root of why he overeats? \n\nI suppose you could go out for an ice cream or whatever when you feel like it, but it's definitely not the same as being able to grab some from the freezer after dinner. I honestly can't blame you for not wanting to live in such a restrictive way in the long term.", "Wow.\n\nThere is no \u201ceasy\u201d way to lose weight. Statistically, most people who try fail.

You're looking at it as what you're losing rather than what you could be gaining. You could gain a healthy partner who lives happier and longer. You could use this as an opportunity to become healthier yourself. You could gain bonding with your partner by going through this together.

Which I'm fine with, since I live with him.  I just remind him to take walks and weigh himself daily, make sure he doesn't eat anything too terrible.\n\nBut for awhile now, there's been a thing where he refuses to get a larger package of anything from the store that he'll eat too much of-- desserts, snacks, etc.-- even if they're intended only for me.\n\nI get the logic behind it, but this has been going on for over a year now.  Sometimes I just want a specific flavor of ice cream we both like, but he refuses to get it because he's afraid he'll eat it all.\n\nSo I blew up at him last night when he asked me what was wrong after a heavy sigh.  No harsh words, but I, admittedly blunt and frustrated because I'm on spectrum and have a hard time being subtle and controlling tone, told him that I wish we could improve his relationship with food.  \n\nI suggested he needs to find a way to just measure the stuff he wants to eat- scoops, handfuls, food scale- rather than sitting there eating the whole thing.  That he needs to learn self control.\n\nHe shot back with how restricting what's in the house is how Alcohol Anonymous handles problems, which is true.  But I told him straight up that I feel that's different, because unlike alcohol, food is necessary, and while a lot of the stuff I'm frustrated with is luxuries and niceties, I haven't had a lot of things like ice cream in months just because he'll proclaim he'll eat it all and we never buy it.\n\nI just feel frustrated, like he's not approaching the issue in a healthy way, and that restricting it is an easy way versus facing the real problem of learning to have a better relationship with food and being mindful of what and how much you eat.  \n\nI genuinely had no issue with it at first, since he needed to lose weight, but sometimes it really feels like he does the bare minimum and skates on by, even with all my reminding and pushing.\n\nNot to discredit what he does do-- he weighs himself in the morning, and will take walks with a gentle reminder.\n\nI love him, I genuinely do, but I'm growing to be in a spot where I might have to separate myself from him before he suffers medical issues and I lose my mind.\n\nSo AITA for blowing up at him and immediately critiquing his reasons?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As someone who has had a binge eating discorder, I cannot have candy and other unhealthy snacks in my house.

Your partner is working on their relationship with food (as you put it) and this is part of them working on it.  You said you may need to separate from him, you're probably right.  It's a lot easier to lose weight when you have a health minded partner.
