Which I'm fine with, since I live with him.  I just remind him to take walks and weigh himself daily, make sure he doesn't eat anything too terrible.\n\nBut for awhile now, there's been a thing where he refuses to get a larger package of anything from the store that he'll eat too much of-- desserts, snacks, etc.-- even if they're intended only for me.\n\nI get the logic behind it, but this has been going on for over a year now.  Sometimes I just want a specific flavor of ice cream we both like, but he refuses to get it because he's afraid he'll eat it all.\n\nSo I blew up at him last night when he asked me what was wrong after a heavy sigh.  No harsh words, but I, admittedly blunt and frustrated because I'm on spectrum and have a hard time being subtle and controlling tone, told him that I wish we could improve his relationship with food.\n\nI suggested he needs to find a way to just measure the stuff he wants to eat- scoops, handfuls, food scale- rather than sitting there eating the whole thing.  That he needs to learn self control.\n\nHe shot back with how restricting what's in the house is how Alcohol Anonymous handles problems, which is true.  But I told him straight up that I feel that's different, because unlike alcohol, food is necessary, and while a lot of the stuff I'm frustrated with is luxuries and niceties, I haven't had a lot of things like ice cream in months just because he'll proclaim he'll eat it all and we never buy it.\n\nI just feel frustrated, like he's not approaching the issue in a healthy way, and that restricting it is an easy way versus facing the real problem of learning to have a better relationship with food and being mindful of what and how much you eat.\n\nI genuinely had no issue with it at first, since he needed to lose weight, but sometimes it really feels like he does the bare minimum and skates on by, even with all my reminding and pushing.\n\nNot to discredit what he does do-- he weighs himself in the morning, and will take walks with a gentle reminder.\n\nI love him, I genuinely do, but I'm growing to be in a spot where I might have to separate myself from him before he suffers medical issues and I lose my mind.\n\nSo AITA for blowing up at him and immediately critiquing his reasons?\n\nEdit: Someone recommended I add that, due to circumstances, I have no access to a vehicle, so shopping by myself isn't really an option.", "created_utc": 1679234646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vm9wk/aita_for_growing_frustrated_with_my_partners/", "score": 1617, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, you are understandably frustrated by your SO's issues with food and the resulting limitations. That doesn't make you an AH, that just makes you human.\n\nEqually, he has realized where his strengths and weaknesses are. His weakness is in not being able to resist those foods when they are easily available, like they are when they're in the pantry. He has realized his strength is in not bringing those foods into the house at all. That's not being an AH, that's just playing to his strength in an attempt to improve his health.\n\nI don't think either of you are being AHs. I think you both need to be able to discuss this without getting angry at each other, because that's the only way you're going to find a solution. So you're going to have to work with him to find a time to have this discussion. When neither of you are annoyed at the other about this. There is probably a compromise that you can both live with.\n\nThat said, I suspect you're going to need to compromise more than him. And I suspect this because I personally have the same weakness, despite decades of trying to overcome it. It's easy to say just go to a nutritionist or a therapist, both of which I have done multiple times, and neither of which have worked. I know what works for me, and I've been fortunate enough that my family accommodates me.\n\nGood luck!", "Buy a cabinet with a lock from home depot or something and don't let him have a key and don't tell him what's in it.  If you've got room get an extra fridge and do the same.", "NTA \n\nHe needs to be in control of his weight loss and frankly I'm disturbed his medical team are making this your problem.", "YTA. You should never have agreed to be his personal trainer. I was a personal trainer but would have never trained my obese husband. I wasn\u2019t his mommy. This is so unhealthy. Get him a therapist that specializes in eating disorders. Actually. He needs to find a therapist. Not you. Seriously unhealthy dynamic.", "NTA This is not a fair position for you to be in. Are you supposed to never enjoy treats in your own home again?", "YTA. Not for being frustrated - your frustration is understandable - but for your lack of empathy and suggestion that he needs \"self-control\" as if it were something that he could (easily) learn.\n\nYou are on the spectrum, yet you have zero empathy for his situation. How? \"That he needs to learn self control.\" Seriously? How many times have people in your life told you that you need to learn something with the same implication - you know, one where it's set up like all you needed to do is just try harder and BOOM it would magically happen? I'm sure he'd **love** to have self-control, but if he *knows* he doesn't have it, then he is correct that he needs to eliminate the temptations.\n\nYou label this as an \"easy way out\" - as if there was **any** easy way to handle obesity and a major shift in diet. It's not an easy thing to do even if you don't have disordered eating tripping you up. Do some alcoholics in recovery find a way to successfully live in a house with alochol without relapsing? Sure. But some of them simple cannot, and those who do may find it a very difficult to do -- too difficult to take on early into their sobriety. They might be able to do it for a short time, then need the alcohol out of the house (or locked away) later. Someone with disordered eating/behavior eating issues is likely in a similar boat as someone dealing with an addiction.\n\nAlso, there are many ways for you to have ice cream without it tempting him. Get a lockbox for your ice cream, for example. Get a separate fridge. Make a section of the cabinents \"your\" cubby area, and setup a Ring camera (or whatever) to monitor it & stop him if he tries to eat anything there. It's 100% possible to have food in your home that he can't eat WITHOUT relying on him having better control over what he eats.\n\nWhile it sure sounds nice for him to develop a healthier relationship with food, that kind of thing can take **years** to develop. By your own account, he is already obese and has a crapton of work ahead of him related to losing fat and getting to a healthy weight. Does it make any sense to delay that process - possibly for years - in order for him to develop this more healthy relationship with food? I bet if you asked a doctor, they would say no.\n\nMe personally? I can't cook a batch of 20+ cookies \"for the week\" -- these will be eaten before anything else. Firstly, they are tasty. Secondly, they're super-easy/ready-to-eat. Knowing these truths about myself, I now get the cookie dough bucket thing that allows me to cook as few as 2 cookies at a time. If I want a cookie, I need at least 20 minutes to cook it. Now it's no longer an immediate/ready-to-eat food in my kitchen, and therefore I'm far more likely to go for the banana or orange as part of my breakfast.\n\nYou should also look into the kitchen safes. They're time locked, so you can get something out of them, but it then locks for X amount of hours. If your SO simply sits and eats a whole contianer of something, then it may not help--but if you go to a place like BJs or Sam's Club and can get large sets of smaller serving sizes (e.g., single serve bag of chips), a time safe can help with forming healthy habits -- he gets one bag of chips or popcorn or whatever, then he's locked out from the next bagfor 4-6 hours.\n\nNo matter what, this process is going to take years. So you need to find ways to keep the luxury foods you want without risking him eating it. If you can't do that, then you need to live separately or breakup.", ">But I told him straight up that I feel that's different, because unlike alcohol, food is necessary, and while a lot of the stuff I'm frustrated with is luxuries and niceties, I haven't had a lot of things like ice cream in months just because he'll proclaim he'll eat it all and we never buy it.\n\nYTA. Just because you feel like alcohol is different doesn\u2019t mean it is. He is very clearly telling you he has an addiction to food and is doing the only thing he knows how to do to prevent himself from binge eating.  Instead of supporting him and encouraging to get therapy for a very real addiction issue, you blew up at him because you can\u2019t have ice cream in the house. Food addiction is very real. Get Dairy Queen on your way home from work or something. You both should attend therapy on your own and as a couple.", "NAH. Youre both frustrated at the situation, not really at each other. \n\nI feel for you but I'm also someone who can't have certain foods in the house because I'll eat it all so I feel for him too. Thing is that it's just as frustrating for me. Luckily I live alone so there's no one else to worry about, but when I really want some ice cream I have to go to a fast food place or corner store to get it. \n\nMy life would be so much easier if I could get a handle on portion control, but when I try and fail I feel so much worse. But I do understand the feeling of wanting to just have something at home so it's there when you want it. \n\nMaybe get a lock box for the freezer or a locking mini fridge? It's not perfect but it does allow you to have more of the treats you want. Your best bet is to sit down and talk this out a little better because really you're both right, but you're both going to have to work to make this work.", "I lost 150lbs. My relationship with peanut butter and chocolate used to be like his \"addiction\". I didn't want any in the house. (I 54f am my mother's (88) full-time caregiver, so of course, I buy what she wants.) To this day, I still fear a tiny bit that if I take one bite, I'll eat the whole thing, even though I eat both occasionally. That said, I was able to work through that on my own. I genuinely feel that your husband needs therapy. NTA", "NTA \n\nHe needs to address his food issues because it\u2019s affecting both of you.

Also sounds like you\u2019re doing a lot of work for him already, like reminding him to go on walks etc when it should be his own priority. Honestly, I know it\u2019s not ideal, but if you could get your own little mini fridge / bar fridge with a lock on it for your snacks. It\u2019s not fixing the issue but you won\u2019t have to hide food or anything from him.", "YTA- I get your frustrations but him limiting portions before they ever come into the house is a viable method for weight loss. \n\nHe\u2019s essentially trying to save his own life and you\u2019re worried that you can\u2019t buy bulk of your favorite goodies. If it were me, I\u2019d apologize and explain the frustration you\u2019re having. See if you two can come up with a conflict resolution.\n\nAs for his relationship with food, I do think it would be beneficial for him to work with a therapist and a real nutritionist. They can help give him the tools to help him with his food addiction.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. When I read the title, I was expecting myself to have the opposite opinion, but you really are being supportive. You're also right that he needs to figure out better ways of dealing with his food issues. Has he seen a therapist to get to the root of why he overeats? \n\nI suppose you could go out for an ice cream or whatever when you feel like it, but it's definitely not the same as being able to grab some from the freezer after dinner. I honestly can't blame you for not wanting to live in such a restrictive way in the long term.", "Wow.\n\nThere is no \u201ceasy\u201d way to lose weight. Statistically, most people who try fail.

You're looking at it as what you're losing rather than what you could be gaining. You could gain a healthy partner who lives happier and longer. You could use this as an opportunity to become healthier yourself. You could gain bonding with your partner by going through this together. Is your ability to eat snacks in your home more important to you than your partner's health? They're telling you what they need and you're not listening. If you're not willing to be supportive in the ways they need, ask yourself why. Maybe there's a bigger issue there.", "YTA.

Which I'm fine with, since I live with him.  I just remind him to take walks and weigh himself daily, make sure he doesn't eat anything too terrible.\n\nBut for awhile now, there's been a thing where he refuses to get a larger package of anything from the store that he'll eat too much of-- desserts, snacks, etc.-- even if they're intended only for me.\n\nI get the logic behind it, but this has been going on for over a year now.  Sometimes I just want a specific flavor of ice cream we both like, but he refuses to get it because he's afraid he'll eat it all.\n\nSo I blew up at him last night when he asked me what was wrong after a heavy sigh.  No harsh words, but I, admittedly blunt and frustrated because I'm on spectrum and have a hard time being subtle and controlling tone, told him that I wish we could improve his relationship with food.  \n\nI suggested he needs to find a way to just measure the stuff he wants to eat- scoops, handfuls, food scale- rather than sitting there eating the whole thing.  That he needs to learn self control.\n\nHe shot back with how restricting what's in the house is how Alcohol Anonymous handles problems, which is true.  But I told him straight up that I feel that's different, because unlike alcohol, food is necessary, and while a lot of the stuff I'm frustrated with is luxuries and niceties, I haven't had a lot of things like ice cream in months just because he'll proclaim he'll eat it all and we never buy it.\n\nI just feel frustrated, like he's not approaching the issue in a healthy way, and that restricting it is an easy way versus facing the real problem of learning to have a better relationship with food and being mindful of what and how much you eat.  \n\nI genuinely had no issue with it at first, since he needed to lose weight, but sometimes it really feels like he does the bare minimum and skates on by, even with all my reminding and pushing.\n\nNot to discredit what he does do-- he weighs himself in the morning, and will take walks with a gentle reminder.\n\nI love him, I genuinely do, but I'm growing to be in a spot where I might have to separate myself from him before he suffers medical issues and I lose my mind.\n\nSo AITA for blowing up at him and immediately critiquing his reasons?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As someone who has had a binge eating discorder, I cannot have candy and other unhealthy snacks in my house.

Your partner is working on their relationship with food (as you put it) and this is part of them working on it.  You said you may need to separate from him, you're probably right.

Or maybe it\u2019s time for a second opinion - as other people have pointed out, some of their medical advice is a little sketch.\n\nI\u2019m spectrum-y myself, so I get how easy it can be to become excessively responsible for other people, how hard it can be to maintain boundaries when someone you love is struggling, and how overwhelming a seemingly small thing can be. But needing to adjust where you eat your favorite snacks and how you store them isn\u2019t the root of your pain - it\u2019s the other ways in which you\u2019ve already been made responsible for your partner, and the way that responsibility has become internalized. Much love, hope you get some better support!", "Imagine a bright blinking light from a lamp in your kitchen that just turns on sometimes. It blinks and blinks and blinks. It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re trying to focus on, it is in your face blinking, over and over, searing into your retinas. \n\nThe light is so bright you can even see it when your eyes are closed. The lamp is so big you can be anywhere in the kitchen and you will see the blinking.\n\nHow do you get it to stop? You could leave the room. But\u2026 that\u2019s your kitchen. How are you supposed to make food? \n\nYou could cut all the electricity to the whole house. That\u2026 seems a little severe and it will turn off the lamp, but cause a lot of other problems. \n\nSo what would most people do? They would just turn off the lamp.\n\nThat blinking light is the feeling of addiction. It is a screaming constant signal telling you to do something you don\u2019t actually want to do, just to make it stop. \n\nFor a food addiction, when you eat a bunch of food, usually high-carb food, it calms those signals down for a while. It turns off the light and you can actually focus and do things with your life now\u2026 but what else happens? It adds unneeded sugar to your system which your body converts to fat because it doesn\u2019t need to burn it. That added fat and the other negative effects of too much food damage your body and your health. \n\nSo feeding the addiction is like cutting all power to the house. You turned off the light but now you can\u2019t see in the other rooms, can\u2019t run your appliances, heaters and so on. \n\nYou get that you don\u2019t want your partner to never be in the kitchen again. What he is trying to do is *turn off the lamp.* He doesn\u2019t want to leave the kitchen and he doesn\u2019t want to cut all power to the house, he just wants to turn the lamp itself off. Keeping addictive food out of the house is turning off the lamp. He\u2019s not cutting all power to your house and he\u2019s not keeping himself from ever using the kitchen in his life, he\u2019s just turning the lamp off.\n\nFood addiction isn\u2019t a matter of actually being hungry or not, and it isn\u2019t a matter of things like \u201cself-control\u201d or \u201cwillpower.\u201d The body is sending messed up signals that tell you to eat eat eat. They are unwanted and often can be unstoppable like that blinking light.\n\nUnfortunately with food/sugar/carb addiction, it\u2019s not \u201ca point\u201d when it comes to having these foods in the house. It\u2019s THE point. \n\nThis is actually like alcoholism. Being around these substances in the home is not safe. But it\u2019s also much harder than alcoholism because as you noted elsewhere, people have to eat. Therefore it\u2019s not like how people can stop drinking or smoking. So the best thing many people can do to respond to food addiction in a healthy, managed way is to restrict what foods come into the home. \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong that it\u2019s hard on you. It is very difficult because this restrictive behavior can be in conflict with the needs of others in a home. It\u2019s also challenging because restrictive behaviors around food both contribute to and are symptoms of eating disorders.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say but this is one of those things in life that is like whether a couple has children or not. You can\u2019t have half a child. Nor can you have half-management of an addiction and have good healthy outcomes.\n\nThere absolutely are solutions. Locked cabinets and separate fridges are absolutely viable. Yes it\u2019s really hard to have to do these things. Yes it sucks. Yes it adds mental duress on non-addicted family members.

Being overweight is more than just food.  Depression, loneliness, loss, or simply home and/or work environment  can play key roles.  Your SO has an emotional addiction that goes hand in hand with physiological traits that make losing weight much more of a challenge.  The CDC issued some treatises on the subject of weight gain, and there is now some evidence that inherited traits may be playing a role in how difficult it is to lose even just a few pounds.\n\nAll this being said, your SO and I share a lack of control on some substances.  In my case, it's chocolate covered raisins.  Have you ever vacuumed up ball bearings?  That's me and chocolate raisins.  Just the staccato sound, and they're gone.  My husband controls all food purchases, so I only get the raisins maybe once in a year.  Not more.  I'm fine with that too.  What I'm saying badly is that your SO has set boundaries for himself and he also recognizes his weaknesses.  If you want to eat sinful treats around him, it's cruel, because he's trying to be good, and your treats only serve to weaken an already thin resolve.  If he fails, he knows you'll be right there to remind him.  He truly doesn't want to lose you, either, but what he's going through is a lot like him crossing a river on a rotten bridge.\n\nEach step he takes is shaky, and uncertain, and if he loses his footing, it could ruin him or set him back months if not years.  His whole life revolves around his weight, and to cope, he's very clear about where he's likely to break a board and drown.  What you're saying is that the food things you want are important enough to you to risk his failure.  Depriving yourself is not fun.  I'm sure he gets it.  He probably always has.  But to stay together, you are going to have to be clever and stealthy.  You have friends or coworkers who can pass the sweet stuff to you, or, many grocery stores now deliver.  Amazon does too.  Have you ever has haggis potato chips?  Very interesting, I must say.\n\nBe kind.  He's in a personal hell and needs all the support he can get.  The medical community is indifferent or outright hostile, so he has little chance of help there. (That's been my experience, IMHO.  F*** off and die, y'know. That sort of thing.) Relationships are best served by a meeting of the minds, so you two need to come up with a way for you to feed your sweet tooth without destroying your partner's willingness to keep moving forward. Best of luck to you both!", "YTA While I understand your frustration with not being able to keep indulgent food in your house; I also understand that having easy access to indulgent food promotes overeating it. \n\nWhat makes you T A is calling his efforts to eat more healthful food, \u201cthe easy way\u201d.

I\u2019ve been in his shoes. He\u2019s doing what it best for him- which is what\u2019s best for your relationship. He has a food ADDICTION. Just like with drugs or alcohol, he can\u2019t stop himself once he starts. I\u2019m the exact same way. I stay away from pizza because if I have one slice, I end up eating a whole large pizza by myself because I\u2019m addicted to food.", "YTA. Not keeping it in the house IS a form of self control. It's the same reason I don't buy potato chips very often. And food addiction is a very real thing. How is he going to learn to have a healthy relationship with food without breaking the unhealthy patterns he has first? This doesn't happen overnight. And eating has a much bigger impact on weight loss than exercise. Don't get me wrong, exercise is important, but him getting a hold of his eating habits is the priority.", "YTA. you can't just 'improve one's relationship with food'. It's deeply psychological and physiological.", "Being in the position of your partner, having issues with food, it really is harder to control the amount eaten than it is to cut out alcohol. A body does not require alcohol to live but does require food. This makes it much harder to control. If I have a large amount of a food that I like available, I will eat the large amount. My husband loves potato chips, cookies and ice cream. They don't usually bother me. I love chocolate, the darker the better. Mixed with coconut, even better. If it is in the house, I will eat it, and in a very short time. I handle this by buying a bag of miniature candy bars. I give the bag to my husband, he stashes it someplace in his workshop, and brings me one if I feel like I really need a candy bar to satisfy my craving. If it were in the house and I knew where it was, the entire bag would be gone in one or two days. I don't know what the answer is for you, I just wanted you to hear the perspective of someone else who does have food issues.", "YTA. Not a big one, but if he nearly died and he knows he doesn\u2019t have the self control to not eat junk food if it is there (I\u2019m the same) then not buying it in the first place is the easiest way for him to control what he eats (I also do this) \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s not green veg and clean meat your taking about, it\u2019s ice cream. You don\u2019t need it to survive. Just do without until you both reach a healthy weight.", "As someone who has lost a significant amount of weight, YTA. Having junk food visible at your house all the time exponentially increases the temptation to eat it, and the best way to control that temptation for me has been to simply not have it in the house. You can still eat such things, just eat them somewhere else. You talk about this being the easy way out versus \u201clearning to have a better relationship with food and being mindful of what and how much you eat\u201d. This is his way of doing that.

That's just how it is with addiction. Freely indulge in what you want, as long as it's away from home or hidden from them at home.\n\nAddiction is an impossible thing to understand unless you've found yourself in the throes of it. I've found myself struggling with alcohol, and my partner has found herself struggling with eating, particularly sweets. Both have caused us to gain weight in our respective ways, and both have made us realize changes need to be made. We don't keep alcohol in the house. I'll drink it in weak moments if I know where it is. We'll have a drink socially together but keeping it out of the house is important as I recover. She doesn't have to regulate herself like I do, because she doesn't have a problem, she hardly drinks. But if she wants to have something on hand when she feels like it? She puts it somewhere I'm not aware of, or goes out with a friend. We don't keep stocks of desserts in the house. Similarly I like a bite or two of a treat from time to time. But if it's in the house and she knows about it, she'll eat it. If I want a treat to be available to me when I feel like it, I hide it, or buy it at the gas station on the way home and eat it before I get there. She gets a package of something sweet she likes and has me hide it. She asks for me to get her one once a day, because if the whole thing is accessible, she will eat it.

At least, with alcohol, at the end of the day you can tell yourself objectively, \u201cthis is poison.\u201d Food isn\u2019t the same. Food is NECESSARY to survive. It\u2019s much more complicated.

So you\u2019re obsessed with making sure food addiction isn\u2019t discounted. But in your obsession, you\u2019re not acknowledging that food addiction is actually worse. It\u2019s harder to find understanding and community, because capitalistic society trains us to hate our bodies.\n\n\nTwo things can be true at once.

I went with weigh daily, average for the week, and track monthly. That way, I could see the trend line, but I didn't panic if the scale went in the wrong direction for a day. That process helped me see the larger trend, while not worrying about the day to day. For women especially, our weight can shift 5-7 pounds easily during the month, but that's just water retention and bloating.
