{"id": 4467, "submission_id": "zitm69", "title": "AITA for not taking a stand on unequal Christmas gifts between my daughter and step-niece?", "selftext": "My (34F) mum met her husband Jeff when I was 15. Jeff has a son, Harry (35) who has been dating Chloe since 2019. Chloe has a daughter called Sam (6) who is a year older than my daughter. Because of the global situation over the past couple of years, my parents have only met Sam in the second half of 2021. I don't believe this is relevant, but my parents also don't really like Chloe.\n\nThe whole family (me, husband, daughter, my other stepbrother and his boyfriend, plus Harry, Chloe, and Sam) were supposed to go to my parents' house for Christmas. It's too long to explain how, but Chloe found out what my parents were planning to buy my daughter, and what they were planning to buy Sam, and that my daughter's gifts were larger than Sam's. She and Harry demanded the kids get equal presents, but my parents said they didn't think that was fair, since Sam isn't their granddaughter. This started an argument because Harry and Chloe say that because Harry is only father figure in Sam's life (her bio dad isn't involved and neither are his extended family), that my parents are her grandparents. My parents said they barely know Sam and while they acknowledge how Harry feels, they haven't had a chance to form that connection with Sam yet, so they don't think of her the same way they think of my daughter.\n\nHarry and Chloe then contacted me and said that I should also put pressure on my parents to buy equal gifts or I should refuse the gifts they got my daughter in solidarity. I refused because I don't think it's my place to bully my parents about their own money, or to deprive my daughter of presents for something that doesn't have to do with her. He says Sam is too young to understand why she wouldn't get as big a gift but I disagree, I've had the talk with my daughter about why she doesn't get as big of a present as me from her dad on Valentine's Day, how is this any different? Chloe then said that as a stepchild I should understand how hurtful it can be to be treated differently, but it has never bothered me that I had to build a relationship with Jeff rather than feel entitled to one, and even today I wouldn't say he considers me like his own child, just like as much as I love him, I don't view him the same way as my bio dad. I certainly never felt entitled to gifts or money from Jeff. I love him dearly but that relationship developed, it wasn't forced on either of us. I told Harry that his stance is based off how he feels about Sam, without any acknowledgement that our parents have a right to feel differently, but Harry thinks this is a reflection on how they feel about Chloe, which I think is untrue.\n\nMy other stepbrother has taken Harry's side, because he thinks it's unfair and will make Sam feel left out, but I think the only reason that would happen is because Chloe and Harry don't want to be parents and explain it to her. So AITA for not taking their side?\n\nEDIT: Since everyone is asking about the actual gifts, both girls are getting clothes. I haven't seen these clothes, so I don't know if they're similar quality. The thing my daughter is getting that's caused the argument is a piece of jewellery. To be honest I'm not sure the kids would have noticed the difference, since they don't know/care too much about designers/stones. The only thing they'd have notice is that my daughter got one extra gift. The price is only relevant if you're an adult.", "created_utc": 1670768075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zitm69/aita_for_not_taking_a_stand_on_unequal_christmas/", "score": 882, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is making a bigger deal than necessary.  And it really isn't your battle to fight", "NTA OP everything you said makes complete sense. I am baffled by people that think they can force relationships and feelings onto others just because they choice to be in a relationship with someone. Your parents barely know Sam. Your brother isn't engaged or married to Chloe. So why is it that Chloe thinks she has to right to force your parents to see Sam as their grandchild? The relationship has to develop overtime and even if they do get married your parents may never see Sam as their grandchild because she isn't. Reddit is the only place I have seen were the notion of being a step family means that the adults in the extended family have to treat the step kids exactly as the biological children even if the relationship/bond hasn't developed that way. As you stated you and your stepfather have a good loving relationship yet you don't love him the way you do your bio dad and you don't expect him to treat you the way he does his biological children. Not treating step kids the exact same as your biological children doesn't automatically mean you don't love or care about them. You can have healthy loving relationships without it being the exact same as the one that you have with your biologically child. The same goes with extended family. Overtime your parents can develop a healthy loving relationship with Sam as their stepgrand child without it being exactly the same as the way they treat their bological grandchild. The only way it becomes an issue is if you put an unrealistic expectation that the relationships have to be the same. You can't dictate how people feel. You can't force people to care about someone way the you want them too.", "NTA\n\nI'm a Dad / Grandpa.   If one of my kids tried to tell me how much I needed to spend for gifts, I would ask them if they were feeling mentally okay?

They don't have to get equal presents because the reality is that they are not equal in terms of the relationship.\n\nThere is a rule of reason and it is pretty normal for people to have different feelings for biological children as they do for essentially the children of strangers. Again these are not adopted children or even step children - they are children of a friend in a relatively short relationship - it is not even long standing relationship where the children have been in their lives for a long period of time\n\nIt is very odd to me that people are justified in disliking their step parents who tried to force a relationship and yet the grandparents are potentially excoriated for not having a relationship with a child who isn't even a step child but essentially the child of one of their children's friends.\n\nAs a compromise, let OP's child open up the expensive gift in private - after all she knows this is coming from grandparents and not Santa as most kids even when they are young get presents from Santa and presents from specific people.", "NTA, umm, Sam is not a step child.

If it's become this big of an issue maybe give that present separately. \n\nAs stated nobody really knows each other yet they still made an effort to get her gifts, and again seems similar aside from the necklace. The only reason this kid will know and take notice and feel a certain type of way is if the adults make a huge deal about it. \n\nI grew up with actual differences in gift giving from grandparents. For example one year I got a watch and a $15 AMC gift card for christmas and watched my cousins open phones, expensive brand name clothes, toys worth hundreds of dollars each for the Littles and more.\n\nOne necklace will not make or break that child and it is NOT up to someone else's grandparents to fill a role that someone else couldn't fill especially when your parents are still making an effort to not exclude her.", "NTA Your brother and his gf are getting upset that your parents spent more on clothes for one than the other.

Harry is not an AH for picking up on this and challenging it.\n\nTo be honest I think Harry should walk away. If my parents didn't respect my relationship I'd say a big 'see ya'.  Especially if there was a child involved. \n\nIt's easy to say it's not your problem but ask yourself what you've hope for if this situation was reversed. Noone's asking you to 'bully' your parents; Harry wants support and you saying 'oh I don't think that's true' is not supportive. You're quite literally refusing to see or acknowledge Harry's point of view throughout this post. I'm leaning YTA for that, and not because you're refusing to get involved.", "Explaining to Sam that she gets lesser presents from the family because she isn\u2019t a real part of the family isn\u2019t the same as explaining daughter vs. wife valentines gifts.", "Info: how big is the disparity in gifts? Is it something a 6 year old would notice? If so, your parents should be kind and make Sam feel welcome. They don\u2019t need to feel the same way about Sam and your daughter, but it\u2019s Christmas and these are just presents. It\u2019s super easy for a grown up to spend an extra $40 on a couple extra gifts to make a child happy. They don\u2019t need to take a stand by making an innocent child feel badly. If they can do a little extra to make sure Sam has a good time and doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being purposefully made to feel less than, then they should. \n\nThe question is, what is your role? If I were you, I\u2019d encourage your parents to be the bigger people, to think about Sam, who hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and who is not responsible for having a mom your parents don\u2019t particularly like. I\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t get behind any situation that makes a kid feel bad, no matter who is technically \u201cin the right.\u201d  It\u2019s not bullying to remind your parents of their better angels.", "NTA.

If giving your daughter one extra gift is going to cause a conflict, this is easily solved by giving it to her privately, not in front of Sam. Normally I get angry when step children are being obviously treated unfairly or excluded but it doesn't sound like this is the case. Sam will be receiving gifts and won't be left out.

It's Sam's parents' responsibility to manage their child's expectations and feelings so the disappointment doesn't occur at all, or gets somehow compensated so it doesn't devastate her. But also, this could very easily be made a lesser drama/not-a-drama by changing the choreography of which presents get opened when.
