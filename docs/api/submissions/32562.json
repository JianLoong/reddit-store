She let him use all the makeup that he wanted.\n(And he broke a mirror) \n\nI'm not happy with the idea that a 5-year-old child can enter my room, mess with everything he wants, and that she didn't do anything about it. (She saw him ruining the lipstick, didn't do anything, and then didn't apologise to me)\n\nI was really upset, but I planned to solve this when my father got back from work, and I also didn't want to get angry anymore before going out.\n\nI took my bag, went to the entrance and she asked me where I was going, I told her (including that I was going with my bf), and she told me to take John with me, I simply said I didn't want to, especially after he ruined my lipstick, and that my boyfriend and I wanted to spend time together to talk, hold hands, etc., and that we wouldn't want to run after a 5-year-old child, and that I wasn't a baby-sitter to take care of her son.\n\nShe said that I was being rude and that she would tell my father that he spoiled me too much, and that I should take care of my brother and whatever. So, in case you're wondering, I didn't raise my voice to her, I wasn't rude, I wasn't ironic, I didn't say \u2018bad words\u2019, I didn't insult her, etc. I just said I didn't want to take him with me.", "created_utc": 1701987160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d757d/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_step_brother_with_me/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also talk to your dad about this, that you need time to yourself and your friends, and that you will play/hangout with your step brother other times. Maybe plan am activity like taking him to the park another day for an hour, just to keep the peace amd so your step mum can't argue that point.\n\nStand your ground but remain polite otherwise step mum will paint you as the bratty child who is refusing to bond with their step family.
