There are a few tasks we've noticed she likes helping out with more than others, so we've modified them so she can participate. She really likes helping with our cats, in the kitchen, and is low key obsessed with our swiffer mop.\n\n\nCurrently, her chores are to feed the cats, empty the cutlery from the dishwasher, and help mop. These chores are supervised and made appropriate for a 2.5 year old. When it comes to the dishwasher, I take everything sharp out and then she puts the rest away or hands me stuff to put away if she can't reach. With the cats, she feeds them twice a day and we've been using her scooping the food to help teach her numbers. When it comes to mopping, she helps push the mop around then we let her go ham with the swiffer after we're done with the initial mopping. We don't force her to do chores nor do we punish her for doing them \"wrong\".\n\n\n\nHere's the issue: my mom and aunt came over the other day to pick some jewelry up for my cousin's wedding. While they were here, my kid woke up from her nap and helped unload the dishwasher. My mom joked about how that was my first chore and that it was funny it's my kids first chore, too. My aunt then told my mom and I that it wasn't appropriate and abusive to give young children chores and that I'm using my kid to be lazy and get out of work. That kids should spend their childhoods playing and that they have plenty of time to learn life skills when they become adults.\n\n\n\n\nI told my aunt she had no business speaking on my parenting when she permanently lost custody of her 3 kids by the time the oldest was five because she she chose drugs and boyfriends over her kids. My aunt left dramatically sobbing and I am now on day 3 of constant twxts from family about what a piece of shit and forcing my kid to grow up too fast and I'm starting to question myself.", "created_utc": 1688016245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lw3ub/aita_for_giving_my_toddler_chores/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All toddlers go through that crucial stage where they want to help. The \u201cme do it\u201d stage. That\u2019s the perfect window to give them age appropriate jobs to help out. Sometimes their \u201chelp\u201d isn\u2019t really helpful and it takes you twice as long to do it with them but that\u2019s part of the parenting process. To get your child to the point where they can function independently. There isn\u2019t going to be a magical time where your kid just figures out how to do things on their own. And yeah, you\u2019ll find yourself clapping and praising over the most ridiculous things \u201cyay you flushed the toilet\u201d.

I'm sure you've saved hours and hours of time by forcing your toddler to do this labor for you (rolling eyes.)/s\n\nYou're providing bonding opportunities for your child.

They want to be involved and feel a sense of worth and contribution by helping. By having a safe environment in which to start building the skills they are developing a sense of self sufficiency and responsibility.

You went on the attack with no real benefit to yourself other than maybe self-satisfaction.\n\n>My mom joked about how that was my first chore and that it was funny it's my kids first chore, too.\n\nThis is the angle you should have used to dispute your aunt's argument. \n\n- Point out that your mum had you helping at the same age, and that you never felt abused. \n\n- Highlight the benefits of you helping out around the house and it being a normal thing from a young age, rather than suddenly saddled with full-on chores at a later age.", "ESH.

What you're doing with your kid is not \"chores\". It is about doing stuff within a house that everyone needs to contribute to to make the household work.

Yes, kids can spend their whole childhoods not learning life skills and then when they move out, wonder how the fuck they are going to pay bills, or how does a toilet get cleaned, or whatever.

You know what is best for your child. Ignore the nonsense your aunt is sprewing.", "I would say yes your are probably T A but would need more INFO\n\nNot for the chores, that is solid good parenting. However if the situation is how I imagine it and someone makes and offhanded comment and you go in guns blazing that makes you an A.\n\nIf someone bumps into you on the street you don't proceed to throw them off a bridge. Now if they are coming at you full force of course, set them a flame and do them a favor by then throwing them off a bridge.", "NTA and read Hunt, Gather, Parent for more support, strategies and arguments!", "Nta. You\u2019re doing the right thing by letting her have age appropriate tasks to do.", "My 5 yr old does exactly the same, she helps with dishwasher and sweeping, has done for years.  I actually have to actively stop her from \"helping\" some days as she wants to do everything! \nIt's good for them to learn, ready for adult life.  Come teenage years they'll do as little as possible!!", "There have actually been some recent studies indicating that involving children with these tasks when they\u2019re very small is great for their development. I can actually remember that phase of my own life when I wanted to imitate Mom and \u201chelp\u201d with everything.\n\nAs for your aunt. Yeah. Wow. It\u2019s generally inappropriate to criticize other people\u2019s parenting decisions even if you were a stellar parent yourself. How TF did she expect you to respond?", "This is how you avoid having to come back to Reddit in 30 years asking why your adult child is still living at home, won't get a job, and refuses to learn how to load the dishwasher.", "NTA. And it's also great to get the kids doing chores while they are keen! My kids have been responsible for making their own breakfast and setting the table since they were 3, making their own lunch since they started school.", "And to them, they aren't chores.  It's fun because they get to do stuff with mommy or asserting independence by doing what the big people are doing.", ">NTA. This is so adorable and wholesome.\n\nExactly how I felt too. \ud83d\ude2d", "and his language and comprehension is actually amazing, and its amazing to see that develop.

Unless there's some history here that OP didn't mention, it sure seems like OP is oddly thin skinned. Some variation on \"that's an oddly hostile remark - what makes you say that?\" would have allowed OP to keep the moral high ground.", "I have a hard time having sympathy for someone who put her children in such danger/neglect they had to be taken away. She has no place to talk about abuse.", "People so caught up in adorable and wholesome that they are not even realising spewed what\u2019s probably the most traumatic/disappointing thing that has ever happened to her sister in her life (granted self inflicted) over a comment that is really not that deep", "Imo chores know no gender, there's no sich thing as \"boy\" chores and \"girl\" chores. Everyone in a household should be pulling their weight. Everyone should know how to take care of themselves and their own household. I hate the sexist bs of \"boys should do this\" and \"girls should do that\".

Aunt was way out of line. NTA imho", "Absolutely! My job as a mum is to make myself redundant by the time the kids are grown. I want to send functional adults out into the world\u2026not overgrown children who expect their SO to take my place. We start official chores at 6 (before then, they help us or their big siblings as they are able). And even at 6 we have to do a LOT of directing and helping. But my teens can do laundry, clean a toilet, do dishes, cook an entire meal, tend to the farm animals, etc. We rotate chores weekly, so no one is stuck with one job all the time, but they rotate through everything about once a month and it has worked really well. \n\nOP, you are not only NTA, you\u2019re also a great mum!", "In my experience its the worst parents who have the types of opinions the Aunt has. \u201clet kids be kids\u201d. She\u2019s the \u201cfriend\u201d parent. \n\nCourts usually don\u2019t take all the kids from a household just because of drugs. I know this from experience. There was more to the situation and it sounds like the Aunt has absolutely no business in saying anything about parenting.", "Then not an asshole at all. I just asked cuz some parents are that dumb to only teach their daughters to do chores.", "And I agree with you in theory. But in execution, she went so harsh on her words, that no one heard what she meant. They heard \"I kick my aunt in her damaged area\" and not \"my aunt needs to mind her own business\". Second is more helpful", "I definitely understand why you asked, there are far too many people living in the olden days where chores were a lot more gendered and people weren't taught the life skills they need to learn due to sexism.\n\n\n\nKeep on asking the good questions and making people think more deeply!", "Thank you.
