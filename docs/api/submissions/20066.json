You say you will never go back but the issues are typical of a brand new restaurant.", "YTA\u2026 you checked out a brand new restaurant and unsurprisingly there were some kinks in the operation because, duh, they\u2019re still figuring things out. Even if this was a strangers restaurant, your \u201copinion\u201d isn\u2019t fair considering the circumstances.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t a random restaurant, it was your friend\u2019s brother\u2019s and that friend was present when you were asked about the restaurant. In this situation you failed to display any empathy, understanding, or concern for your friend\u2019s feelings.", "YTA and the type of reviewer that restaurants do not like to have, especially for a new restaurant.  The one-time entitled restaurant snob. Even many regular restaurants have delays, staff shortages etc. occasionally and bad nights.  A little bit of consideration and reading the room was needed, both for the restaurant visit and for your group of friends.  They gave you a discount and apologized which says alot for a new place.\n\nFor the record, I tend to give a restaurant a couple visits before I make up my mind about it, as long as not grievous issues like cleanliness.  Being busy and slow on food delivery, meh.  Not liking a dish?  Don't order again or ask for something else.\n\nI bet your friends won't trust your restaurant reviews going forward after this.", "\nAs a 20 year-restaurant manager, starting a new one always comes with some growing pains, and what you described is indicative of what normally happens at the start. New menu, new employees, new Point of Sale system, everything. This should bear some consideration when forming an critique. \n\nAlso, being honest is important, but so is grace and tact. \u2018A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.\u2019 As Mary Poppins said. I\u2019m convinced that your response to your friends\u2019 curiosity was negative and probably a bit condescending, and therefore received the same tone in which it was delivered.\n\nPlus, from the way you\u2019ve related the story, it seems that it went like-\n\nOP: So, I went to the new place last night.\n\nFriends(including owner\u2019s sister): Really? How did it go?\n\nOP: It sucked.\n\nSo, not only did you slam Mae\u2019s brother (and make no mistake, this was personal to her), you OPENED UP the conversation that allowed you to do this.\n\nYTA", "So brand new restaurants in your area get overwhelmed by locals during their first weeks of business. You go there knowing that. You experience the problems of too high demand and a brand new staff but somehow it doesn\u2019t compute why it happened. And then you trash it in front of your friend who\u2019s personally connected to the owner and you don\u2019t see how that\u2019s rude either. YTA, Mae is right, you do need to reflect on why your socially unaware.", "YTA. It had just opened, there are going to be hiccups, overload of customers, possibly new servers or kitchen staff. Always go twice and then give a review. Jerk move saying what you did to your friend.", "YTA.\n\nBrand new restaurants generally have hiccups.  It may take a bit of time to get the kinks out, and that includes food all arriving together, recipes, staff efficiency, etc.  It would have been nice if you said there were some problems with your experience but you hope they can work them out.  Maybe it will improve and maybe it won't but you painted the picture with wide brushes and not just your experience.\n\nAnd complaining that you had to wait for a table at a busy restaurant is ridiculous.  Unless you had a reservation, when the restaurant is full, you wait.  That is normal.  That should be expected.", "I agree - YTA and you are classless and tactless. **You know** you deliberately instigated the discussion the restaurant so that you could share your negative opinion with everyone, including the restaurant owner's sister. That was a very destructive and inconsiderate action on your behalf.\n\nI don't understand why anyone with half a brain would expect a brand new restaurant to deliver a perfect dining experience? You sound like you enjoy being able to \"make or break businesses early on\" like some wannabe influencer with no moral compass.", "YTA this is a newer restaurant, they are going to have some delays and hiccups. They discounted you to make up for it. \n\nBut the part about having to wait doesn\u2019t make sense to me. You can see how busy a restaurant is by just looking at it, you knew they were busy but complained when the food took a little longer, how long of a wait are we talking 10 minutes? \n\nAnd the staff are going to be quite uncoordinated given that this I would assume was opening night, or was one of the following nights so will still need some time to get used to it.", "You described extremely normal new (successful) restaurant things. You had to wait ages for a table\u2014make a reservation then, that\u2019s not something the staff or restaurant can fix if they\u2019re that packed. They can\u2019t conjure seating. It\u2019s a new restaurant, of course the staff are fumbling a bit/of course they still haven\u2019t figured out how much seating they need. Have you never interacted with someone who works customer facing jobs that is being trained? Not once? By 33? Dishes being late makes sense if they\u2019re busy, that is in fact how restaurants work, especially if it\u2019s new and the cooks are still adjusting. They also cannot conjure perfectly cooked food out of thin air, it takes time. Unless it was like three hours this isn\u2019t valid. I can\u2019t believe they gave you a discount, that\u2019s insane. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if you didn\u2019t like the food, but the rest of it makes you sound entitled and obnoxious as shit, or like you\u2019ve never been outside in your life. YTA. One thing out of your list of complaints was valid and you frankly could\u2019ve just shut the fuck up in front of your friend or said something vague or just \u201cit was fine/interesting but not my usual taste\u201d. Is that so fucking hard? To not be a complete ass about something so normal? \n\nEdited to add: the fuck do you mean you can\u2019t change your opinion about places you\u2019ve had a bad experience at? Yes you can, that is the whole point of choice and trying things more than once.", "Long waits, unorganized staff and long wait times for food are typical for a newly opened place. That's all excusable.\n\nBut if the food is meh... yeah I wouldn't go back either. The whole reason your there is to eat. NTA for having an opinion.", "YTA. There\u2019s a trial and error period for a new restaurant, finding out what does and doesn\u2019t work. You listed all of this in your issues, and it\u2019s very likely those issues won\u2019t persist.", "YTA - because you blasted a brand new restaurant shortly after they opened. Those are growing pains, stuff that's going to happen at the beginning. And, you got a discount but still followed up with a scathing review.\n\nIf they've been open for quite some time (more than a month at least) maybe you can call them out on it. But don't get the discount and then burn them to the ground.", "This is one of those examples where yes, you didn\u2019t break the law or whatever, but you were an asshole. Would\u2019ve cost nothing to tell a white lie. Not even a lie, but a half truth, something like \u201cit was very busy!\u201d would suffice. Or you could\u2019ve said literally nothing, seeing as your the one who brought it up. So yeah, YTA. Rude for no reason", ">\"I can\u2019t change my opinion on the ones I\u2019ve had a bad experience at.\"\n\nSure you can.. by giving it a second chance. If it gets overwhelmingly positive reviews and you had a bad experience, then maybe its a fluke. You owe it to yourself, the restaurant and the sister of the restaurants owner to verify your newly formed biases before passing them on. YTA", "YTA, this sounds like any restaurant on opening weekend. there are going to be those growing pains with everyone still learning how things run and how things function practically during service. the staff seemed like they didn't know what they were doing because *it was literally their first or second day at the job -* and by your own admission, it was busy, which is going to be more difficult even for an experienced staff to handle. YTA for not taking this into account and having any empathy for the restaurant staff or the owner's sister. you sound like the \"brutally honest\" type.", "YTA. In general new restaurants are a shitshow the first couple of weeks that they're open to begin with, so going in during that early opening period is really a toss-up whether the place will end up being any good or not.   \n\n\nTo give a review to that new restaurant owner's sibling during that early opening time is ludicrous. Bad judgement all the way around on this.", "YTA. The only ever reason to shit on the restaurant is if they didn't try and were rude. \n\nDid you have a reservation?? If not, you have no right whatsoever to complain about the wait.\n\nWas the food actually terrible , or was it not to your taste?? There's a different, big difference. Like, I don't like squid. Now, if the burnd it or not seasoned it properly, it's on the restaurant. But if I didn't like it just because of my preferences, it's on me. \n\nThe only real complaint you have is that food didn't get served at the right time. And you got a discount to make up for it.", "Considering the restaurant was clearly busy and overwhelmed, you could've stretched your empathy muscles a little. If you truly didn't enjoy it that's your opinion to hold but going to some place once when the staff are obviously struggling and expecting their best is pretty ridiculous.\n\nYour opinions are yours to have and share but don't be surprised if you messed up a friendship because your expectations were unreasonable. yta", "YTA.  Tbh, you give off a really negative vibe and the restaurant sounded really normal for a new business.", "YTA, it\u2019s people like you that make our jobs so much more difficult. Brand new place, yes there will be a wait. Brand new place, yes the staff is still learning. \nTry out a new place sure. But go back again in a few months once they get the gears greased and working before you badmouth them around town, especially a small town. \nI\u2019d like to see you get a good review from everyone on your first week on the job. Sheesh. Everyone\u2019s a critic.", "YTA for the way you expressed yourself in front of the owner's sister, also the restaurant acted in good faith giving you a discount for the issues. Yeah I wouldn't go back either, but why being so indiscreet?", "I mean, you are being rude. You KNOW it\u2019s a NEW restaurant in a small town. That usually means they have new staff and are slammed when they first open. Of course there will be some minor issues when it\u2019s opening weekend and whatnot. You need to learn some grace YTA", "YTA\n\nYou state plenty of reasons why this NEW business would reasonably have a rough night as an establishment. The restaurant knew things weren\u2019t as good as they could have been and made efforts to rectify that for you. Nothing about your description says the restaurant was neglectful, rude, gross etc. You were being mean just to be mean.", "YTA. It's fine to give your opinion when asked. What you lack is tact. Think about your audience and make your statement accordingly. You can say you didn't like something without being blunt.", "YTA, everyone who eats out regularly knows that the first month of service is not indicative of the quality of the place. You've got new, often understaffed staff because they're still hiring, the chefs are still working out the local taste and request volume, and they're always 100% swamped past capacity when that happens. \n\nYou could have just acknowledged that you didn't like the place at first pass, but you understand being so new that they've got some kinks to work out before you go back again, like a normal, reasonable adult. You also said all that with the full knowledge that the businesses family was present, in which you didn't have to change your opinions, just have some fucking tact like the fully grown adult that you are.", "YTA - expecting perfection on the first few nights of a new restaurant is ridiculous.", "This really reads as someone that has never been to a new restaurant. And someone that has no social awareness. Are you an AH for having an opinion no, but YTA for for not having the awareness of when to speak it.\n\nThe restaurant also did their best to make it up to you even though there is next to nothing they can do about a long wait. Dishes coming out at different times can be annoying but really it ruined the night? \n\nWhen I do new restaurants that don't impress me right away. I try them when they open, then again about six months later and then one more time once they seem settled in and in a routine", "YTA you mentioned you went there, knowing that was gonna be asked/that you were going to say that. I'm presuming with that friend right in front of you at the time. You were chomping at the bit to shit on the restaurant.", "Ruined your evening huh?", "If you were aware the owners sister was present in the group when you voluntarily brought up that you had went there, then yes definintely YTA. You had already decided on your negative opinion of the place, so why bring up that you went there when you reasonably should have known you would be asked your opinion? \n\nYou have every right to your opinion, and to share it, but that doesn't mean you still weren't an inconsiderate AH.", "YTA and maybe a little sociopathic.", "Yta. You knew the restaurant was owned by your friends brother and you really thought she'd appreciate your negative review? You have no tact. Or you don't actually care about your friends feelings.\n\nEdit to add: there's a great quote that fits along the lines of \"Honesty without kindness is cruelty.\" Your honest opinion doesn't need to be shared if you can't be kind. In consideration of who you were speaking to,  it wasn't kind.", "YTA. \n\nHonestly I am baffled by the N T A responses with justifications like \"they shouldn't have asked if they didn't want an answer.\" If your SO or mother asked if you thought a dress looked nice, would you guys honestly respond that it looks horrible on them, even if you truly thought so?\n\nEven if you thought that the restaurant was truly awful, you should've taken into account that the OWNER'S SISTER was a part of the conversation. Like imagine if your best friend made clothes for a living, and the next thing you hear is another friend rattling on about how shit their clothes are, you would be pissed like Mae was.\n\nYou don't need to sing the restaurant's praises, just say something like \"I didn't have the best time, it just wasn't my taste.\"\n\nHuman Decency 101.", "YTA. It takes a while for new restaurants to work out the kinks. Your friend didn\u2019t ask you your opinion of \u201cany new restaurant\u201d. She asked your opinion of her brothers restaurant.", "YTA\u2014 you\u2019re entitled to your opinion but why trash a new business that is clearly going through growing pains.  You could have said, \u201cit clearly was not their night, I\u2019ll wait until they settle in a little before trying again\u201d or left it at \u201cnot my favorite style of food\u201d so that the others could go and form their own opinions.  Sounds like you have unreasonable expectations, so why go to a brand new restaurant before they\u2019ve had a chance to work out the kinks?", "YTA\n\nMost of your complaints are specific to this being newly opened: \u201c*The place was bustling, great crowd for a new place - the servers are still working out the details but they were courteous and working hard. They gave us a discount to make up for the wait.\u201d*. That\u2019s all the same details but without the negativity. \n\nAs far as the food, we really do not know what OP didn\u2019t like. Is it an unfamiliar ethnic cuisine? Is it seafood or vegan when OP prefers steak? Overall too spicy? Too bland?  Without details, there\u2019s no way to interpret - most of OP\u2019s comments are complaints about the *experience*. \n\nOP, YTA because you are tactless and take no responsibility for the impact of your words.", "The \"I'm only being honest\" approach is no excuse to lack empathy or tact, especially when discussing something directly linked to a friend's family. Your bluntness wasn't constructive, it was harmful. Learn to communicate criticism in a supportive and helpful manner. YTA", "imma agree with mae you seem so judgey oh no the food took a bit longer oh no things werent perfect a small family owned business that just started oh no you got a discount to counter act the flaws oh no you didnt deem the food to your (probably bland and fast food loving self) standards oh no you lack self awareness YTA  times infinity\\]", "NTA. You weren\u2019t shitting on it for any reason other than the bad experience you had. If the experience was as bad as you say, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re far from the only guest who felt that way. Everyone saying you\u2019re in the wrong is making excuses for a bad experience", "These other responses are bullshit.  It sucked and you explained why. Let the hearer decide if it is new restaurant stuff.  \n\nEveryone calling you the asshole is the reason reviews mean nothing anymore.  Everybody gets five stars and everybody gets a 20% tip because their life is hard and anything else is tearing them down.  Fuck that, you had a bad experience and said as much\n\nNTA", "NTA.... You gave an honest opinion. Even if it's opening weekend, it's still your money that you worked very hard for and if someone ask your opinion, give it to them.   I have worked in food service and have been anything from a delivery driver for an established restaurant chain to someone working at a business that just opened. I'm also a customer. I don't have much expendable income at the end of the month, so if we do splurge and eat out or order in, I expect the experience to be worth the money that I paid. I leave generous tips as I have worked in the industry, and I will usually reach out to the restaurant directly If I have an issue and not leave a bad review unless I didn't hear back, especially if it's a small or local restaurant because I do recognize they don't have as many resources as a national chain would possibly have and I want to support them. But if someone were to ask me directly what my experience was, I would be honest.  If you had given it a good review and all of your other friends had horrible experiences, they would be upset with you.", "Yeahhhh YTA. You brought up the restaurant in front of the owner's sibling. It would've been one thing if she'd asked if you'd been, but you brought it up. Very poor taste. Not to mention, you seem to hold a brand new restaurant to the standards of a well established one which is asinine.", "YTA. This is a brand-new place, a lot of new places need a little bit of time to work out the kinks. Haven't you heard the term \"read the room?\" You weren't asked your opinion, but chose to bash the place to several people including the owner's SISTER. I think it's odd that  you wouldn't be willing to try a new place again, after they've been open a while and had time to smooth things out, especially considering it's owned by the brother of a supposed friend.", "Are you known by your whole friend group to be a harsh critic? You mention that Mae said you don\u2019t like anywhere.

That's all a big yikes. \n\nYou say you can't change your opinion, but you can certainly work on when and where you decide to deliver it as well as how. There is a difference between what you think and how you say what you think and you're too old to not know that.\n\nThis is basic social graces that most kids learn at a much earlier age (before being hosted at others homes for dinner, for instance) and the fact that you even did it/ have to ask suggests you're probably an asshole in other areas too.\n\nIt's especially obnoxious because you're the one who brought up that you went there. Given your experience and who you knew was present, the most polite thing here would have been to never bring it up unless directly asked.

I mean, did she say that with a straight face?!\n\nMore seriously - if you knew that it was Mae's brother's restaurant, then you should have been more tactful about your experience, especially since it was in their early opening period. But at the same time, restauranteurs can't go into the business being thin-skinned and over sensitive, and they have to earn every table, every time. That's the challenge of it.

Unless you were taunting her and said the restaurant should be shut down or something, I don't think you did anything wrong. \n\nThough I get writing off something if you have a bad experience, another thing to consider is that the restaurant is still growing and making mistakes, but it doesn't mean it will be like that if you went again. Just judging from them giving you a discount, it sounds like they are making mistakes but are aware of that. Not a lot of restaurants, even the good ones, offer discounts. But, obviously, it's up to you and your family and if you found the experience so bad that you don't think a second time would be better, that's your decision.

I've been to a new restaurant that explained that they only had soda, ice tea, and water because their liquor license had been held up. I was  willing to return to all of them a month or so later. But a restaurant that was slow, screwed up orders, missed orders, and had food that didn't taste good? Yeah, never going back.", "Penny said, \"I think it is a good idea to use reddit for the most part and not have to worry about that too much\"", "ESH.

That being said, your friend shouldn\u2019t expect you to basically lie about your experience, just because it\u2019s her brother\u2019s restaurant. You can be honest and say you didn\u2019t like it. It could also be helpful for your friend to relay your feedback to her brother, so he is aware of what\u2019s being said and he can look into possible adjustments.", "Hmm...I'm saying NTA for giving your opinion when asked. \n\nBUT- IF this place is brand new and new places are as popular as you say in your area, I feel your review is unfair and saying you'll never go there again, under the circumstances, does sort of make you look like an A. H. \n\nI've worked in restaurants/food service off and on, in various positions, since I was 16 (34 now). I did culinary and hospitality management in college. I also now live in a small town. \n\n1. Blaming a place for the wait (indicated by it being the 1st thing you mention after you said it was a terrible experience) *WHEN THEY'RE BUSY* is ridiculous. What would you like them to do? Toss people out the minute they've taken their last bite? Allow customers with invites only? You chose to go knowing they were new and knowing how excited people get in your area for new restaurants, you should have managed your expectations better. That shouldn't be part of the negative review. \n\n2. The staff didn't seem like they *always* knew what they were doing/dishes coming late:\n They're new. If your area is like mine, they probably don't have a huge selection for staffing. \nEither way, you can do all the training you want,  but until you're live, and until you get a big rush like that, you'll never really know where your big weaknesses are. \nThis isn't your fault as a customer, but come on. You can cut them some slack. ESPECIALLY, considering they discounted your meal and apologized. AND you know that negative talk can seriously impact businesses starting out in your area. \n\nThe only area I feel is completely fair is that you guys didn't enjoy the food all that much. Unless it's like some specialty food. Like I know I don't like sushi so I wouldn't go to a sushi place and complain that the flavor wasn't good. Other than situations like that- not enjoying the food itself is a valid complaint. This could still be down to staffing (especially new staff) and dinner rush. Maybe they became overwhelmed and didn't prepare the food properly. Or maybe it's not that great. \n\nI wouldn't personally write them off fully after 1 visit while they've just opened. If they'd been defensive or rude, then sure. Since they apologized & reduced the bill it seems more like they've accepted fault and as a new business would likely work to improve what went wrong. If you're open to it, maybe give them another try after they've been open a bit and had time to work through the kinks. \n\nOverall NTA because you were asked how your experience was and you gave the honest answer from your perspective. Even if it's your friend's brother's business you're still allowed to give honest feedback. Most places would rather hear that vs someone lying saying things are great but only bc they're friends with someone close to the business. It's also \"not your problem\" that they're new and still adjusting. Your experience was what it was regardless of whatever is happening on the business end.", "You\u2019re NTA for offering your opinion when asked YTA for badmouthing a business that is new you are aware it\u2019s new complained to the management and sounds like they did everything they could to make it okay and you still feel the need to persuade others not to go", "Honestly NTA. Everyone has the right to have an opinion. Yes, they gave a discount. But it was still mediocre food and not that pleasant experience. And the fact that the restaurant gave the discount only confirms that they have admitted causing this negative experience. So why would Mae try to blame OP so aggressively when: a) the restaurant admitted their fault, b) it\u2019s literally none of her business, c) she started attacking personally by saying that OP always gives negative opinion (which should be irrelevant). Sounds like a overprotective and childish behaviour to me.\n\nAnd since when the apology from the restaurant equals to not going around badmouthing? Seems more like bribing than a genuine apology, doesn\u2019t it?", "YTA.  Don\u2019t you know that you don\u2019t go to a restaurant until at least it has a month and they have gotten all the kinks worked out.

It sounds like everyone in your town is more interested in being the first to try a new place than to give it a week or two to work out the opening day kinks. And then, when the kinks appeared \u2014 imperfectly trained staff, a long wait, slow food, all of which are symptoms of a new restaurant being overwhelmed by people trying to be the first \u2014 they addressed them, apologized, gave you a discount. Literally, there was nothing more they could do. So instead of saying \"the restaurant was super busy and overwhelmed so I can't fairly judge it,\" you decided to tell others that you'd never go there again based upon the worst day in any new enterprise's life. Not a fair assessment; the restaurant offered a sincere apology, and now people who might have enjoyed it in two weeks when they organize the right amount of staff, the timing of seating, the kitchen's timing, and an assessment of the food preparation and flavor and adjust the menu accordingly. This is why restaurants often have a soft friends-and-family opening, so they can get practice in on supportive folks.", "YTA.

The building used to be a small small shop on the bottom floor and a living area on the top floor. They had like 5 tables and only one thing to make the crepes on.

If someone didn\u2019t like what they got one time they talked about what they would try the next time. They had enough business that they were able to buy a bigger building and more equipment so now they can keep up with all the customers.

As long as you gave the full picture - long wait for a table (to be expected with a new place in a small town), disorganized staff (also not surprising), some dishes weren\u2019t great (the most valid point IMO) and they gave you a discount (excellent customer service - manager fixing what they can control). It doesn\u2019t sound like anyone who has been to a new restaurant would actually be deterred from going, but they\u2019d wait a couple weeks for the kinks to get ironed out. \n\n\n\n\nNAH you gave an honest review when asked.

Even with a kitchen working what they knew, bar working what they knew, waitstaff, hostesses, bussers, everything set up optimally\u2026even with all of this you can\u2019t chase out people on vacation or trying the restaurant for the first time. Wait times were long. And as the night progressed, more and more people were angry by the time they were sat, even being told it\u2019s a 2 hour wait, because they were hungry. Outside of putting time limits on tables, which the owners were not willing to do, I can\u2019t move people. \n\nAnd complaints ran across the board. People who had been drinking all day thought the drinks were weak.

You should be treated with professionalism.  But look around. The place is a zoo. You\u2019re stopping a waitress with a tray full of heavy plates to ask her when you can sit (she doesn\u2019t know.) You\u2019re sitting at unclean tables outside of your turn and then mad no one is cleaning your table or asking for your order. There\u2019s sections, there\u2019s allergies, there\u2019s handicap accessible tables, there\u2019s a whole system in place. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hungry.

There are very few normal and polite conversations where it is acceptable for *anything* to come up. Conversation is always tailored for the company that you are with and rarely is it true that literally anything at all would be a fair game topic of conversation for any given group of people and any given context and relationship. \n\nEither you have some manner of neurodivergence that you haven't mentioned (and no disrespect to those folks who do!), or else you already fully well know this. \n\nGenerally speaking, people are capable of choosing their topics of conversation with tact, foresight and empathy and if they don't, it's reasonable for others to think of them as rude. \n\nWhy are you incapable of tact?", "Your friends are truly unfortunate to have you in their life", "how do you know?", "My apologies, they didn't have a wedge salad so everything on the menu is disgusting.", "A discount means very little if the experience was bad enough to not consider returning.", "If waiting during the packed soft open of a new restaurant is a deal breaker for someone, that\u2019s the kind of dining patron you don\u2019t want returning to your restaurant.", "reread her first paragraph. they\u2019re brand new, how else are they supposed to find their footing if not making mistakes & fixing them?  \nbadmouthing the new place in front of the owner\u2019s relative & an entire circle of friends is insanely tactless. they deserve another chance."]}
