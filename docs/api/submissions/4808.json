You own the house/lease and have roommates/friends who have since moved in and invited their GFs to come with. First of all was that agreed upon by everyone? \n\nIt sounds to me like the roommates weren't pulling their weight to begin with and they just brought in freeloading GFs who just feel entitled to whatever they want. Do they ever cook and offer food to you? If they sincerely feel that you're the roommate from Hell they could make different arrangements. Its awful Aholey to come into someone elses situation and make these demands and changes all while berating them. NTA!", "NTA Entitled AHs, expecting you to pay to look after them.

You are their roommate not their parent its not your job to feed them.", "NTA, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are trashing your place now that you've left.

I could see you asking if they want something if you're going out to pickup food but in no way should you have to pay for their food. That's just nuts.", "Talk to a lawyer who knows your local laws about this.  You might be able to get them to leave faster, if they have been threatening to you, or because you feel unsafe with them in your house now, to the point where you are sleeping elsewhere.  You should be able to make them move out, not you; some places have different laws when you live in the house with the tenants.  And change the locks.", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable for you to tell them to get out - this is such entitled behaviour and moreover, it's **your** house.

Unfortunately that can be enough for people not to like someone and they then will find fault in everything you do. If you have the power to I would be giving them the 60 days if it was me", "NTA. The situation has become too much, therefore it must end. You only have the option of evicting, you can't move, since you own the house. \n\nNTA. No one deserves to be insulted like that in their own home. No one should be threatened; this is a threat \"I would go back in my room if I knew what's good for me\"\n\nI think you should have gone with 30 days or less. \n\nYou are getting taken advantage of and they're treating you less than anyone deserves. \n\nINFO request. Did they ask if they could move the GF's in and are they paying rent? Or are they splitting rent with original roommates?", "NTA.\n\nIn shared living situations it's generally expected that each person pays for their own food, cooks it, and cleans up after themselves. There may be some exceptions. For example, in one of my shared houses we had a \"community shelf\" (one in the pantry and another in the fridge) where people would take turns buying items that the whole house used and anyone could use what was on the shelf (to avoid having 6 open jars of peanut butter or 6 bottles of ketchup, for example). Also, different people would buy household products (TP, paper towels, dish soap, etc) and we'd reinburse that person for our share. There are simpler/more complicated ways of dividing up shared costs depending on how honest the people involved are.\n\nIt sounds like your current living situation is stressful for you because the others feel entitled to more than they give. That's never a good environment. They sound like the kind of people who will expect more the more you do for them. I think you made the right choice in evicting them. However, if they are really as entitled as they sound, they may try to be vindictive by damaging the apartment in some way before they leave. You may want to think about ways you can document or prevent this from happening as much as possible.", "NTA, they sound really awful", "NTA. Make sure you have everything done legally first. They are your roommates, not guests. It isn\u2019t your job to provide for them. It\u2019s not your job to buy them food, clean up after them, or give them your toilet paper. Fife then their notice and tell them it\u2019s pas time they grow up. Also you shouldn\u2019t be hiding in your room to eat. It\u2019s your house and if they don\u2019t like you are eating and they aren\u2019t then too bad for them.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even need to read the whole thing to know my stance. I don\u2019t agree with you berating either of the girls but I totally get why you did. Get them out", "Info: do they ever provide food for you?", "NTA \u2026 that seems very entitled of them. Do they offer you their food? Do they ever offer to cook for you? \n\nI\u2019d say get them out and start fresh with others and maybe be upfront before they move in with an agreement on how to handle groceries", "NTA - and thank God you kicked them out.  Let's see how long it takes for them to get at each others throat because they didn't buy food for everyone else.  Watch, they'll will take their aggressions(insecurities and irresponsibility really) out on the next person that doesn't cater to them.", "NTA and please stick to kicking them out. It's kind you wanted to help them, but they are taking advantage of you. I truly hope you can find better roommates in the future.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to make them food.\n\nIt would be one thing if y\u2019all have an arrangement to switch cooking for each other but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.", "NtA. Unless its prearranged that some of their rent goes to food purchases its not your problem. (I have roommates but i pay the rent, they each pay an extra 100 on top of their share of rent so that i can buy groceries for the household but this is all prenegotiated)", "NTA it\u2019s time for some new roommates", "NTA by a long shot.\n\nHoly hell do you live with some entitled leeches. The girlfriends have some nerve doing what they did, and shame on the others for letting their significant others even act that way. These people are grown ass adults renting, not living at home with mom and dad.\n\nGet these leeches out and never look back. If anybody talked to me like that in my own house, they\u2019d be getting out the fastest legal way.", "Totally NTA on both things, eating your own food and kicking them out. They are clearly unbearable, I would have already considered kicking them out for leaving everything in a mess and trying to brush it off on you.\nBut watch out what they may take from your house or destroy on their way out.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve never had a roommate who had the expectations of free stuff that these people seem to.", "NTA. How often do they prepare food that they share with you?", "NTA. \n\nIf they dislike it so much they can get out of YOUR house. \n\nIma make this clear: its ONLY going to get worse.
