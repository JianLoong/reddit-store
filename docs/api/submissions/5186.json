My youngest daughter still lives with me and my wife (her mom). My oldest daughter moved out a few years ago. Ever since my oldest daughter moved out, she doesn't visit much. Occasionally she'll attend a family dinner that we invite her to but for the most part she enjoys her space and privacy. She's also very introverted. I'm not sure if it's because of the fact that she's on the autism spectrum but I still love her dearly nonetheless and support her. The last three Christmases she spent with her ex-boyfriend at his house (they eventually broke up).\n\nWe invited her to spend this Christmas with us again. She has a new boyfriend now but said she probably will spend it with us this year. Recently we invited her over for a family dinner. She noticed there were 5 stockings hanging up. Mine, my wife's, my youngest daughter, the dog's, and the cat's. There was no stocking hanging that had my oldest daughter's name. We used to hang it up each year until after she moved out and started spending Christmases over at the house of her ex. That's when we naturally got accustomed to her not being over for the holidays and this year hanging up her old stocking wasn't the first thing on my mind. \n\nWe honestly thought she would stop spending holidays over here permanently so naturally we stopped hanging her stocking. We didn't expect after 3 Christmases of not spending here that she would start spending it here again. When she noticed that her old stocking that we used to hang (back when she lived here) wasn't up with everyone else's, she got mad and left shortly after dinner. I tried to explain to her that it was NOT intentional and I reminded her how much we all love her. We thought she would be spending another Christmas away from the family like the past three years (except this time with her new boyfriend instead of ex).\n\nFrom what she told me her relationship with him is too new to be spending over there on big holidays so that's why she agreed to spend it here. The no stocking was out of sheer habit because we were so used to her not spending Christmas here ever since she moved out. She's almost 30 and is very upset with me and has been crying. I feel like she's overreacting and not sure how to calm her down. The name stockings are only for decoration. There's no gifts in them. I already bought a nice gift for her and will be making one of her favorite foods for Christmas dinner.

It sounds like you're just being spiteful.", "For me NTA as you explained it wasn't intentional,  I see where you are coming from my kids don't visit often since they moved out mostly due to everyone's work schedules. I toyed with the idea of do I keep hanging their stockings up? Even though they rarely visit during the holidays we do meet up every Christmas at their grandmother's. Out of habit I do still hang them up just incase they decide to visit and for nostalgia plus I also think it would upset my husband too if I didn't, but in the last 2 years I've often stood going it doesn't quite feel right and that question often nags me around Christmas time too if I don't will they be upset if they visit which is rare? If I do is it really that important? They are just cheap stockings that were only ment to last a year or two it's been 8+ years \n\nI grew up very family orientated , my husband had the opposite upbringing his family are very aloof and independent of each other  so from what I've seen his mom doesn't hang their stockings up anymore either just hers she stopped with other stockings when everyone either hit adulthood or moved out.\n\nJust explain hey just because a stocking isn't up it doesn't change our feelings, we felt it wasn't needed to be hung as visits never happened I'm sorry we hurt your feelings now I know to just keep hanging it up out of tradition. Maybe invite your daughter over more and make a family day of hanging stockings and decorations next year so she feels included again. \n\nShe may also be feeling a bit lost she went from having a relationship where she knew the plans probably had visions of settling down and starting her own traditioa  to a new relationship one that doesn't have anything of her old life. She may be  finally having to admit she has nowhere really to spend Christmas except with family. Whilst seeing her stocking missing she possibly came to  realise that in her absence over the past few Christmases the traditions had changed slightly, everyone had moved on to doing things differently while sh is having to revisit what she ust assumed  would stay the same sven with her not attending or living with you. This is often a sobering thought for many people, doesn't matter her age that stocking was in her eyes a.symbol that things were different in her life now vs 2-3 years ago. Christmas is hard for many and often a time of reflection of the year good and bad. And a huge factor in the name the holiday blues we yearn for past times and revel in nostalgia and traditions with loved ones alive or gone", "I\u2019m going against the masses here to say NTA. Your daughter is an adult who never spends the holidays with you and has changed her habits (by her own admission) because its \u2018too soon\u2019 to spend it with her new bf. You forgot to put up her stocking when you found out she was coming, fair enough. It\u2019s not nice but it doesn\u2019t sound like anything intentional, she\u2019s taking it way too hard. Say sorry, put it up now, send her a picture and tell her you want her there!", "NTA. What is everyone talking about?? It\u2019s a stocking. It\u2019s normal to hang stockings for the people that live in the house, and the daughter not only doesn\u2019t live there but also hasn\u2019t been to Christmas there for years. They\u2019re just supposed to put an empty stocking up for her every year? No, weird. If daughter had said \u201chey where the heck is my stocking\u201d and dad had said \u201cI refuse to hang your stocking\u201d, then that would be Y T A. This is not that. They just weren\u2019t hanging it anymore because it didn\u2019t make sense. Dad can just hang daughter\u2019s stocking now, daughter needs to cut it out. Even if her reaction is due to her autism, that might be N A H, but dad still isn\u2019t T A.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Holy guacamole OP you\u2019re a bad father. genuinely.", "This need to be the top comment.\n\nRemember that post, and him arguining in the comments because he wouldn't accept the YTA judgement too.\n\nThis guy is a piece of fucking work.", "The stockings on the wall aren't supposed to be an attendance list. She's still part of the family, so she should be up there. Soft YTA.", "YTA,I'm one of 6. No matter where in the world we are,  mum always hangs our stockings. I lived in a different hemisphere for 3 years and didn't come home and she STILL hung my stocking out.\n\nIt's not Christmas yet, hang her stocking up and apologise sincerely", "Our kids took their stockings as they moved out. My wife knitted similar ones for their SOs. If they stay with us over holidays we remind them to bring them along. If they forget, oh well, IT\u2019S JUST A CHRISTMAS STOCKING.  \n\nNTA. Give it to her in a velvet wine bag or something.", "YTA. Look at OP's previous post about his first child compared with the child he has with his wife.", "Wait your youngest still lives with you? But you said she\u2019s getting married in your last post. Is this all fiction writing?", "YTA", "Soft YTA. You put the stocking up even if you put nothing in it. It\u2019s that connection to family. Me and my sisters are in our 30\u2019s and our parents put all the stockings up even now.", "We never had stockings when I was growing up.  My parents were European and we did things differently.  So I don't really get why stockings are important.", "YTA.\nIf you knew she was coming for Christmas and you used your stockings for gifts then what was she going to do while everyone, including the pets, were going through their stockings? Then you mentioned they were only for decoration which makes it even worse.\n\nIf you had a custom ornament on the tree that had all of your kids' names on it did you scratch hers off after she moved out?", "YTA. How hard is it to hang one stocking even if she's not there? It's Christmas time and for family. By taking her stocking away, you are showing her that she not really family anymore. Horrible.", "no one's TA, although it sucks to not see your stocking up, she was overreacting but you already said she was autistic, I am myself. think about it this way for many autistic people it's hard to cope with change and that expectation don't meet reality.\n\nwhat happened here was she expected her stocking to be up, she links it to being welcome. her feelings are valid but her reaction was probably due to her autism.\n\nwhat makes you a little bit of an asshole is that you try to act like there should be a solid reasoning to not put it up which there doesn't have to be, the best course of action is to apologize for it, and then asking if she wants to come over soon and that you love her, as I can see you truly care about her.", "NTA", "INFO : did you sell her stockings to pay for your other daughter's wedding? Did you tell her she has to wait a few years to have a stocking too?", "Yta, you were on here a few days ago asking because you couldn't see that you favoured your younger daughter- and apparently you can't see how this would hurt her? You suck", "NTA she doesn\u2019t live there and hasn\u2019t spent Christmas with you for years. Plus it\u2019s not like you did it on purpose.", "\nI have friends & know some parents with deceased children who still hang stockings out for them.", "YTA. I don\u2019t understand why you would hurt her like this.", "I hung stockings for my step-kids, their spouses, the grandbabies and my step-nephew... even though they can't all be here this year. In my family, you hang stockings for everyone regardless of attendance... I love seeing them up and the kids (grown people) know that this is their home... albeit in a weird way since they've never lived in this house (kids were grown when we got married).\n\nYTA but a redeemable one.\n\nMerry Christmas", "YTA. Just because she's an adult and moved out doesn't mean she doesn't exist as your daughter. I have three kids, neither that live with us anymore. But I still have their Christmas things set out because they're still family. This is their family home. I now have grandchildren and theirs are out as well even though they don't live with us", "Plus there is literally zero effort in putting the stocking up.\n\nI mean, even the cat and dog got one...", "This but I would go with strong YTA. I would even put it up if my kid doesn't come. Because it is your kid and the stocking should be up if you put the others up. YTA", "I don\u2019t know. I think they should hang the stocking whether they are there or not. I don\u2019t think it is valid to leave them off. It is about thinking about family and those you love when you look at them during the Xmas period. Especially if they are just decoration and not being filled. \n\nI know I have Xmas baubles that are for loved ones and hanging them on the tree, even those who are not with us, actually especially those who are not with us, makes it special. You think about them and what they mean to you when you hang them. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hurt someone would feel to actually be at their own families house and see they were not thought of, not included. How sad. What a way to show an absence of love and thoughtfulness at Xmas.", "Exactly. Surely it just lives in the same box as all the other stockings for most of the year. You get out the box, you hang up all the stuff then you take it all down in the new year. Who looks at the stockings and picks and chooses which ones are going up?"]}
