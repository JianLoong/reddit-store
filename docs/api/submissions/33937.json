We're in Ontario, Canada.  \n\nA few years ago, Canada started some stuff with additional gun control.  For reasons (good ones, actually) my husband, I and kids, are all licensed and own a few guns.  My husband and son TRAIN safety, by certification, as well as the law, here.  We are, understandably, very very fussy about compliance and safety, in my house.  My Mom knows this.\n\nShe hates guns. I have no idea why, and she would tell me if she had a reason, but she doesn't.  I'm okay with this. Honestly.  She can hate guns all she wants. It's honestly cool.  I have NEVER tried to make her like guns. She is entirely within her rights to hate them.\n\nBut, one day, during the news coverage about the new controls, my mother decided that I should hate guns too.  I told her to go jump.  The argument got a little heated, because she could not understand why I didn't tow her family party line, and hate guns too.  Apparently, my husband brainwashed me. I don't know when that happened ... I always thought that my formal training taught me about them, and they weren't as evil as my mother believes.  I also tend to very much have a mind of my own ... that's an understatement ... so how my husband managed a brainwashing of me, I have no clue.\n\nAnyway, she decided that all guns had to leave our possession because she hates guns. Then she tried what she thought was her trump card, and announced that she'd never set foot in my house, again, so long as there were guns in it.  \n\nThose guns, BTW are in a locked room, in locked safes, in locked cases, with trigger locks.  The ammunition is on a different floor of the house, also in a locked safe.  The keys are very well hidden.  It all might not stop a thief but it might slow them down enough to get caught.  And we don't publicize our ownership to reduce the chance of someone breaking into our locked house.\n\nAnyway ... She wouldn't set foot in my house until the guns were gone.\n\nImagine her shock when I said that I rather liked this arrangement because she tended to be a little critical of my housekeeping and I could relax a bit, knowing she wouldn't be turning up to find the only cob web that I'd missed.  And, frankly, I really can do without her gardening \"advise\", so a moratorium on her visits would be a nice break.\n\nCool.  She wouldn't come to my house.\n\nBecause the guns weren't going anywhere.\n\nAs I recall, this happened in 2020.  She stubborned it for longer than I thought she would. Then began hinting that she'd kind of like it if I invited them for dinner at my house. I'd remind her that the guns weren't going anywhere.

I tried many things, prescribed by a series of neurologists, including some brain specialists at a large hospital in Boston. I started with the triptans, then worked through other, well-known alternatives. I also tried Botox, then started experimenting with the newer Aimovig, Ubrelvy, and a couple of others, before finding Qulipta. It was like throwing a switch in my brain. My constant 4-8 of 10 levels of pain dropped almost immediately to 0-1. I am a Qulipta success story and talk about it whenever asked.\n\nNow, there are a couple of important things to consider. Qulipta works brilliantly for me, but I appear to be a relatively rare case. I am the only patient it works for, out of all the patients seen by my current neurologist. It has not helped my son, who also suffers from migraines. In fact, I am the only person who gets it at my very busy suburban pharmacy. They have to special order it for me when I need a refill.\n\nAdditionally, Qulipta is expensive, new enough, and not widely used, which means that it\u2019s not generally covered by insurance. When I started, they had a program that allowed me to get it for free. Once I started on Medicare (government insurance), they had to remove me from that program, because of our idiotic, unhelpful medical system and its arcane laws. That means I\u2019m paying for it out of pocket now, which hurts on my fixed income. I can\u2019t function without it and life is wonderful on it, so I have little choice.\n\nI still keep a small supply of medical marijuana on hand for the rare occasional migraine flare.\n\nMy advice: do some research on prescription medications for migraines and talk to your neurologist. Ignore the claims of weird alternatives, diets, and other BS. Look for actual medical double-blind trials. Your neurologist should have samples to try. (My son just got one dose of a new med that\u2019s a nasal spray, which he needs to try again.) If something doesn\u2019t work, advocate for yourself and ask to try something else.
