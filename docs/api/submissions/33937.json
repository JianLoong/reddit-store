We're in Ontario, Canada.  \n\nA few years ago, Canada started some stuff with additional gun control.  For reasons (good ones, actually) my husband, I and kids, are all licensed and own a few guns.  My husband and son TRAIN safety, by certification, as well as the law, here.  We are, understandably, very very fussy about compliance and safety, in my house.  My Mom knows this.\n\nShe hates guns. I have no idea why, and she would tell me if she had a reason, but she doesn't.  I'm okay with this. Honestly.  She can hate guns all she wants. It's honestly cool.  I have NEVER tried to make her like guns. She is entirely within her rights to hate them.\n\nBut, one day, during the news coverage about the new controls, my mother decided that I should hate guns too.  I told her to go jump.  The argument got a little heated, because she could not understand why I didn't tow her family party line, and hate guns too.  Apparently, my husband brainwashed me. I don't know when that happened ... I always thought that my formal training taught me about them, and they weren't as evil as my mother believes.  I also tend to very much have a mind of my own ... that's an understatement ... so how my husband managed a brainwashing of me, I have no clue.\n\nAnyway, she decided that all guns had to leave our possession because she hates guns. Then she tried what she thought was her trump card, and announced that she'd never set foot in my house, again, so long as there were guns in it.  \n\nThose guns, BTW are in a locked room, in locked safes, in locked cases, with trigger locks.  The ammunition is on a different floor of the house, also in a locked safe.  The keys are very well hidden.  It all might not stop a thief but it might slow them down enough to get caught.  And we don't publicize our ownership to reduce the chance of someone breaking into our locked house.\n\nAnyway ... She wouldn't set foot in my house until the guns were gone.\n\nImagine her shock when I said that I rather liked this arrangement because she tended to be a little critical of my housekeeping and I could relax a bit, knowing she wouldn't be turning up to find the only cob web that I'd missed.  And, frankly, I really can do without her gardening \"advise\", so a moratorium on her visits would be a nice break.\n\nCool.  She wouldn't come to my house.\n\nBecause the guns weren't going anywhere.\n\nAs I recall, this happened in 2020.  She stubborned it for longer than I thought she would. Then began hinting that she'd kind of like it if I invited them for dinner at my house. I'd remind her that the guns weren't going anywhere.
