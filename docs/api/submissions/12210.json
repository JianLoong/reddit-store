{"id": 12210, "submission_id": "11qcxgl", "title": "AITA for not letting my neighbor park in my spot?", "selftext": "Hi there.\nSo a bit of background. \nI (39F) live in a 13 floors, 50 apartments building with an adjecent parking lot that has one assigned spot for each apartment and a few unassigned extras. \nMy mother lives a few floors above me. She drives but has no car (takes mine when she needs to). \nI have been parking in her assigned spot for as long as she's lived there, about 20 years now, when I visited, and continue to park there now that I've moved into the building myself, out of routine, and her spot is just a better location than the one my apartment has assigned. \n\nThe neighbors in the spot next to mine randomly use my parking for their 2nd car, without asking me. Annoying but not a huge deal. \n\nRecently my sister and her family came for a visit and stayed with us for a week, so I gave them access to my parking to use as they come and go freely.\n\nAbout a day after they arrived, I get a message from my neighbor (late 60s early 70s woman) that a strange car has been using my parking. I wrote back that I know, thanks. \nShe wrote back that she just want to make sure I know who they are because if they have access to the parking lot they can also get in the building. (The lot is not underground so not sure what point she was trying to make other than being nosy).\nTo ease her mind I told her the car is my sister's and she's here for a week and will be using my parking. \n\nI get a phone call from her yelling at me that I should have told her that I will be using my parking for a week, and now she has no parking place for her car and what is she to do. \n\nI reminded her that she is using my spot without permission, and I don't owe her anything whatsoever. \n\nShe kept on yelling at me that I am being unreasonable and eventually called me a slut and said she feels bad for my baby. (I am a single mom by choice and went through IVF to have my daughter.) She also said she'll call my landlord to evict me.\n\nI told her in no uncertain terms that she cannot park in my spot ever again and there will be consequences if she does. I may have also lost my cool and had a few choice words for attacking my 2 year old.\n\nMy sister and her husband said they are willing to park on the street, so she can keep parking in my spot to keep neighborly peace and it was an AH move to tell them to park in my spot since our street is not that busy, my mom says I am right but should not have used bad language (I agree with her on that).\n\nNow I am wondering if my sister and BIL are right and I used this as an opportunity to get back at the woman and therefore an AH.", "created_utc": 1678721732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qcxgl/aita_for_not_letting_my_neighbor_park_in_my_spot/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think she was wrong to make sure you were aware that someone else was using it, but when you said you knew about it and had given permission, that should have been the end of it. It's your spot and let your guests use it, if you choose to. And she *definitely* shouldn't have been insulting you and your daughter or trying to threaten you.\n\nTo be clear, I asked, since if you *had* given them permission, then you would have owed them a heads up in advance. As is, they had no reasonable expectation that you would never make use of it, and certainly weren't entitled to anything.", "Not that it will change whether you're an AH or not but why does your neighbor not have their own parking? It sounds like parking is written into the rental agreements for each unit. Does your neighbor have more than 1 car for their unit? If so, they need to take their concerns up with management.\n\nThe apartment we rented, before we bought, only allowed 2 vehicles per unit but because my husband had a work truck & a personal car, our rental agreement was altered, at the time of leasing, to include a third vehicle (he had to park his personal car in an unassigned spot but was given a sticker so he would not be towed).", "It is in many urban areas if property management has it automatically built into the rental agreement & refuses to remove the cost if it's not being used by the assigned resident.", "OP says for their second car, so yes."]}
