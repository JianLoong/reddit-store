And you aren't coming off as open to figuring out what could work for you both to be okay, and you're supposed to be an equal team, not a coach and a player.\n\nMy immediate thought is wondering about how you plan to setup and clean up. Since you'd be handling the Elf on a Shelf, are you planning on something like [ruining the kitchen](https://images.app.goo.gl/bXL73FpqzWsQAVzT7)? If so, food waste and the possibility of cleanup falling on her already full Christmas plate could be the main issue. Do you know what other potential EotS setups are giving her anxiety? Can you work together on solutions? \n\nMaybe your Elf is outdoorsy and is outside only. Your Elf only likes to pee their name in the snow and use all the good markers to color the snow and use the clothesline to climb a snow mountain or the side of the house.

People are getting caught up on the friend when in reality she is taking out her issues with Brett on her kids.", "I agree with you totally. Some people tell their kids that every night the elf goes back to the North Pole to report about behavior to Santa, but I think that\u2019s creepy so that\u2019s not part of it at all at our house.

That\u2019s why your awful friend cut his families\u2019 hair. The elf is supposed to get into mischief every night (not straight up abuse though). Jesus, man! Do your research!

They don't have the capacity contribute to household funds, and don't make final decisions about household decor and trips because they're elementary schoolers.\n\nBecause they're elementary schoolers, they can be easily distracted by some other shiny new toy. If dude can't keep his wife's opinion in mind for this one small thing, how is he with larger decisions? Is he just going to steamroll her every time he *feels* her anxiety is illogical? Sounds like an unsustainable way to handle a partnership, and dismissing her concerns undermines the whole shebang.
