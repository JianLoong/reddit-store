Your wife has anxiety. No, it isn't logical- but she told you that this would make it worse and you did it anyway. \n\nSecondly, I also say that, from an outsider perspective? I wouldn't trust you either. Look at the company you keep. Cutting someone's hair without their permission is *abusive*. That is a part of someone's body. That is a violation of bodily autonomy. Your wife has VERY good reason not to like Brett- I sure as hell wouldn't want that kind of person around me, or my kids. You say that you've never done anything like what Brett did, but you're sure fine with being friends with and defending him. That *alone* tells me that I can't trust you. \n\nThirdly, and this is a personal opinion, but the Elf on the Shelf is just... Iffy. You want a toy in the house that teaches your kids to be okay with *every single second* of their day and night being watched and reported back to someone, who will then decide to reward or punish them based on what they do in their most private moments?

Just because everyone is an AH doesn\u2019t make all their deeds ok.", "What exactly wouldn't he tolerate in your marriage?", "That\u2019s not an extreme prank, that\u2019s an extreme violation of personal space and extraordinarily creepy thing to do. You don\u2019t seem to grapple how weird and unnerving that is.", "That's like trying to handwave physical abuse because \"it's normal in their family.\" \n\nDude, no.", "**It REALLY sounds like you're crossing the wires on two issues here.**\n1. Your buddy is someone your wife doesn't care for nor want to be around. \n2. Elf on a Shelf being done in your household, despite your wife's (diagnosed or witnessed) anxiety.\n\nBased on your defensiveness about him, I have a feeling she might be pressuring you to distance yourself from him since she's seen his negative behaviors influencing your marriage's everyday dynamics. Question: did your friend say that him doing Elf on a Shelf brought him closer to his kids and made more family Christmas memories? If that's what you're trying to do too that's admirable! It would feel super frustrating that your wife doesn't see that upside! But I think she's frustrated too. Even if it's not about your friend specifically, her anxiety is linked to you doing Elf on a Shelf. And you aren't coming off as open to figuring out what could work for you both to be okay, and you're supposed to be an equal team, not a coach and a player.\n\nMy immediate thought is wondering about how you plan to setup and clean up. Since you'd be handling the Elf on a Shelf, are you planning on something like [ruining the kitchen](https://images.app.goo.gl/bXL73FpqzWsQAVzT7)? If so, food waste and the possibility of cleanup falling on her already full Christmas plate could be the main issue. Do you know what other potential EotS setups are giving her anxiety? Can you work together on solutions? \n\nMaybe your Elf is outdoorsy and is outside only. Your Elf only likes to pee their name in the snow and use all the good markers to color the snow and use the clothesline to climb a snow mountain or the side of the house. Or the elf came by after you shoveled the driveway this morning just to throw a snowball right in the middle of your hard work!\n\nI think you're invalidating your wife in this decision. And it's so low stakes that you're digging in because \"it's small potatoes, why can't I do what I want to do?\" Which isn't how healthy adult relationships thrive.\n\nIn all your comments I've read you've never *explicitly* stated that you wouldn't do something like cut your wife's hair. The closest you've gotten is saying that the other family's prank setup/dynamic \"isn't our style,\" but doesn't say you wouldn't ever do it.", "Why is it hard for *you* to accept that your perspective on that is unhealthy after so many people telling you?", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because you\u2019re not acknowledging how traumatic it can be to have your hair cut when you don\u2019t want that. Obviously a little strand that can be easily hidden in not as bad as shaving a chunk (or the whole head, why do you think prisoners have their heads shaved at concentration camps?) but the fact that you\u2019re brushing off something that is considered assault shows you\u2019re a poor judge of character.", "\u201cMy friend assaulted his wife and child but neither of them said anything about it to me personally so its 100% fine! Other families do their own thing so how could I possibly judge him for doing that to them? \n\nAnyway my wife is worried I find that acceptable and asked me not to buy the doll but fuck her amirite? Why would she think I\u2019d ever do something like that to her?\u201d", "I think the point is that you are rationalizing your friends abusive tendencies, directly followed by crossing your wife\u2019s boundaries and making her uncomfortable, and saying things like \u201cstuff were okay with, they couldn\u2019t live with\u201d.
