Sounds harmless, right?\n\nIf his underlying thoughts are: no expectation it has been done, he literally just wants information so he knows if he might go and do it soon - that will come across in his tone of voice, and I will respond with the information, because it was just a request for information. \n\nHowever - if his underlying thoughts are: *she should have done the washing up, OMG how annoying, I bet she hasn\u2019t done it* then that will very clearly come across in his tone, and it will piss me off, and I will react to how judgemental he is being. \n\nHe can use EXACTLY THE SAME WORDS but in one scenario it\u2019s not a big deal, in the other he is being an AH and we\u2019ll have a fight about it. \n\nHe used to think that if he said \u201cI am not judging, I am asking a neutral question\u201d that it would cancel out his judgmental tone of voice. \n\nIt really, really doesn\u2019t\u2026!\n\n(To be fair, he was lying to himself as much as me in those moments, because he didn\u2019t think he should be being judgy.

Do you live in a macmansion somewhere that your kitchen and your living room and the balcony with the door are all in their own separate zip codes, that you couldn\u2019t have walked and done it?\n\nAnd now let me gaze into my crystal ball - you\u2019ll respond in a way arguing with me telling me why I am wrong to expect you to step away for the min it\u2019d have taken you to close the door. \n\nIn 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 \u2026", "That's because they don't want to get into a annoying discussion with you, they know when they disagree you start one of your tantrums.", "Does she get upset when the plans change or things go wrong?

The issues are too small tbh", "Maybe it's the way you do it? Idk, I'd poll other people to see if they've noticed that sort of vibe from you.

You\u2019ve been told by your girlfriend and multiple replies that your current stance is annoying. It might be better to reflect on these judgements rather than continue to argue with them.

You think you have to voice your opinion. I was told this very same thing and I had to check myself. Unless someone is in danger just let people do something you may think is stupid or could be done a different way.\n\nThe fact that you think you should never have to hold your tongue is you always wanting to be right.

No. People do not have to be corrected every time they're wrong. It's super annoying. It makes people feel bad. There's a very old saying: Do you want to be happy or do you want to be right?", "A few things. No, you don't actually -have- to voice your opinion all the time. Especially if you're just doing it to be contrary. No, people do not like being \"corrected\" all the time. And, just because you are \"correct\" doesn't mean other people are wrong.
