NTA.", "So women who request women practitioners are also sexist? Just making sure you're consistent.", "It\u2019s completely normal to want a doctor of the same sex. My irl friend feels uncomfortable with a male doctor, and chooses to have 1 of the same sex. She isn\u2019t sexist, it\u2019s just a preference that normal people have.", "It aint sexist, hes simply more comfortable with a man lmao. I personally agree with him, Im a woman and i feel way more comfortable with a female gyno or a female doctor if my body is going to be touched or exposed in any way. SPECIALLY if I have certain things I want to ask or speak about. \n\nIll go to men in emergencies. \n\nIm sure men gyno are experienced and great doctors, but I am much happier with a woman and will go out of my way to find one.", "But isn't he dealing with his problem by requesting a cancellation of his appointment? He wasn't rude, he wasn't mean. He just asked to cancel his appointment. I work in the healthcare and I am a woman. If he is uncomfortable discussing certain issues, he can request for another doctor. If the roles were reversed and it was a woman saying that she cancelled her routine gynaecology appointment with a male doctor because she was uncomfortable, would you react the same way?\nThe receptionist could have been more professional. Working in healthcare, she needs to learn to treat people without bias and that also includes male patients being uncomfortable with discussing certain issues with female practioners.\nI would say NTA.", "Yeah, lesson learned there. I just went by the name listed on the website and didn\u2019t even think that there was probably a whole team in the office.   It\u2019s bee like 12 years since I\u2019ve had to switch doctors!", "But this is going to be his GP going forward and would then have to do the things you listed in the future", "I mean if he wasn't comfortable  he just wasn't. I'm sure if a woman wasn't comfortable with having a male doctor she wouldn't be labeled as sexist. Also alot of people feel awkward when telling a doctor of the opposite sex about certain problems than they would with someone of the sane sex", "And yet during the exam OP may need discuss the issues with his penis, ED or lack of sex drive. Which a male would probably relate to better than a female.  \n\nSo yeah, NTA OP. This comment is tone deaf. \n\nSome medical items are understood better by a person of the same sex who may have experienced them. How many times have women complained about heavy periods, issues with cramps and male doctors just chalk it up to \u201cit\u2019s something all women go through\u201d. It isn\u2019t and most female doctors will actual discuss and look at options as they deal with it monthly too. It\u2019s a known issue of bias when males a women\u2019s health\u2026..I would think the opposite is true too!", "Haha, nicely put. I\u2019ve had a woman insert a catheter and a man stick his fingers up my butt and neither experience was made any better or worse because of the gender of the medical professional involved.", "I\u2019m a woman. Does me wanting my primary care doctor to be a woman make me sexist? No. Does it make me a big baby? No. \n\nIt\u2019s okay for men and women to have a preference for primary care doctors. It\u2019s not cool to make fun of a man for having a preference any more than it would be for a woman. It\u2019s actually a bit sexist to call OP a big baby.", "Why do you assume his discomfort with different sex doctors stems from his junk?", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big baby thing. Women often want a female OB-Gynecologist \n\nI personally don\u2019t care, but no one should be shamed for this", "I agree, if he was all weird about someone at the ER or a cardiologist or something that\u2019d be different, but PCP is very different", "The best care is the one that puts the patient at ease to disclose everything to the doctor. If you\u2019ve noticed, doctors usually will ask lifestyle leading questions to get a well rounded view of the patients daily life so they can catch markers for preventable issues. If a patient doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with their doctor (regardless of gender) they will not be as open as they need and markers will be missed. I would not be comfortable with a male doctor describing my menstrual issues and would definitely leave things out that would\u2019ve probably been useful information like I do to my female doctor.", "As a cis woman, I feel more comfortable with biologically female practitioners because they can often relate more directly to what\u2019s happening so it\u2019s easier for me to explain things to them. Other people might feel more comfortable with providers of a certain sex due to factors like trauma. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s sexist because it\u2019s not discounting another providers abilities or saying they are inferior in any way, they just aren\u2019t the right provider for the patient.", "That's ridiculous. People can choose whatever gender they want for their doctor\n\nNTA", "What a fucking horrible take", "It is never unreasonable to ask for a doctor that you\u2019re comfortable with.", "I don't see why you're being aggressive about this. If OP was female, and felt uncomfortable with a male practitioner would that be acceptable to you?", "So....I'm sorry, but I regularly see women request female doctors, and they are told it's perfectly okay and not sexist at all. So are you saying it's wrong for someone of any gender to request the same gender doctor?", "So all women that prefer female doctors are also sexist?", "I purposefully chose a female primary care doc because as a female I know I\u2019ll be more comfortable discussing my body and my needs with a woman, and it\u2019s been my experience that women doctors are more likely to listen to my concerns and not talk over me.  (Not always the case, but it\u2019s a pattern I\u2019ve noticed). \n\nGuess I\u2019m sexist too.", "It\u2019s for an annual physical. With a new PCP. \n\nNot dental work.", "Where the hell did you get dentist from?  This is a general practitioner, which is for annual full body physicals.", "It's an annual physical.", "It\u2019s not a dentist, it\u2019s a general practitioner or PCP\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly acceptable to want a PCP of your own gender", "Clearly you didn\u2019t read the post", "No, it a general practitioner, like your main doctor. I specifically said I wouldn\u2019t care if it were a dentist or something.", "Why does it matter? If women can ask for a female doctor, a man can ask for a male doctor.", "It isn't a matter of confidence in the abilities of a female practitioner. It is a matter of his comfort. Many people prefer same-gender practitioners for primary and sexual health care. I could be presented with the choice between a man who is the top rated gynecologist in the country and a woman who is a well-rated but not outstanding gynecologist, and I would choose the woman every single time. I am not comfortable with a male provider looking at or touching my genitals unless it is an emergency and they are the only doctor available. OP is not comfortable with a female provider giving him a prostate exam or testicular exam. That is 100% fine.", "His preference doesn't imply that female doctors aren't competent.\n\nIf you have a moment to actually read his post, I think you'll find your answer there.", "I'm going with NTA.  \n\n\nHe didn't say anything bad about woman doctors. Just like how you prefer to have a woman doctor, he prefers to have a male doctor.", "Nice straw man fallacy there, or can you actually direct me to where op said \u201cbecause she\u2019s a woman and what would she know about male anatomy when she doesn\u2019t have it\u201d?", "Ahhh i see it now.. thanks for clarifying it and i agree with her", "Yeah my bad", "NTA. You\u2019re not TA, but this is a bit of a silly issue.", "My obstetrician was a man. He\u2019s a great doctor & has seen more of me than people need to ever see. I have 4 kids.", "If the only doctor you can get in to see is a man ... would you delay your care?", "For the same reason woman don\u2019t want a guy all up in their private space. \n\nAlso... as I said I would respond to my husband the same way. Physical exams are intrusive for men & women. If you\u2019re not comfortable with your doctor... then you won\u2019t go to your doctor. Never a good plan.", "There\u2019s no shame here... it\u2019s just reality. Both men & women doctors are capable of treating any gender but if you\u2019re uncomfortable having a conversation about your body with only a specific gender & the only person you can get in to see is the opposite gender ... then kind of you\u2019re a baby. It\u2019s their job to hear & see things. \n\nAs I said everyone needs to be comfortable with their doctor.", "Seriously .I\u2019m a woman and I\u2019m not comfortable with male doctors cause of my anxiety I can\u2019t talk about certain things with them. I prefer female. If the genders were reversed people wouldn\u2019t be saying he\u2019s(she\u2019s)  an asshole", "part of the issue is the question *why* OP is uncomfortable with a female doctor. If it's just \"oh well I feel like I'd be able to better open up to a male doctor\" OP needs to get over that. It's a doctor not a therapist. \n\nAlso female doctors aren't known for not taking male patients seriously, which is why it's a lot more justified (in my opinion) when women ask for male doctors. For women their doctor's gender can be a question of life or death, for men not so much.", "No, it isn't. A patient who isn't comfortable talking to their provider about something is a patient who isn't going to be treated for that issue in a timely manner.", "That\u2019s a pretty lazy generalization.", "Would you say this about woman?", "There\u2019s no issue because it\u2019s all a personal choice. People get to decide who their doctor is. Men deal with life & death issues. If they feel better in an exam room with another man that\u2019s their choice. It\u2019s not sexist. \n\nWe aren\u2019t talking about a mechanic to fix a car. This is a human being that should be comfortable with their doctor. Period. OP may be sexist but this isn\u2019t an example of that.", "What\u2019s your opinion on females preferring female doctors?", "Yes", "by life or death issues I mean that women are dismissed by male doctors *extremely* often and this can have serious consequences on their health. It's scientifically proven that women have better health outcomes when treated by female doctors.\n\nand yes, it is a personal choice which doctor you go to, but to me in this case it's like a straight man not wanting to see a gay urologist because gay men have sex differently.", "as I said, I believe it's way more justified since women are scientifically proven to have *significantly* better health outcomes when treated by female doctors. Also women, on average, have a way bigger reason to be scared of sexual assault by male physicians (or men in general).", "Kinda feels like you\u2019re just saying women aren\u2019t capable of sexual assault. You\u2019re part of the reason men don\u2019t come forward more often."]}
