The disabled/pushchair/large baggage barrier is frequently out of service due to kids pulling it open forcibly to avoid tapping in. This is a regular issue, unfortunately.\n\nI just got back and the lady in front of me needed the larger barrier exit. Two girls, about 14, were waiting on the other side. One had an oyster card out. Instead of tapping to open the barrier, the girl with the card pulled on the barrier as the woman passed her, preventing it from closing. She and her friend slipped through. Now, the TfL staff in the office were unlikely to have seen this as the station was busy in that moment (terminating station).\n\nKnowing this has been an issue in the area, I waved to the staff and asked if they'd seen the two skip the barrier. The woman working made a frustrated sound and said 'again?' She told me that kids were doing it a lot lately and she would report it, but they themselves couldn't get involved due to safety concerns.\n\nA man came through as I was speaking to her and started shouting at me for grassing up little kids. I ignored him. He kept going. He then left the station and started telling everyone in the street how I was an awful human being for grassing up two little girls and how people like me should rot in hell. Most people ignored him. A couple shrugged. One said 'so?' and kept walking. He followed me for a few metres, still shouting, before cycling off in the other direction.\n\nNow, had these girls been outside and asking for help covering the \u00a31 fare (child fare) I would have, and have in the past, topped up their cards to get them home. Alternatively, they can get the bus anywhere this line goes completely free of charge. It just takes a little longer. Additionally, by not tapping in, if they exit at a station where they are forced to tap out, they will be charged the max fare (something like \u00a37/\u00a38). Another issue I have is that yes, the tube is still pretty cheap, but being down in travellers there has been a lot of talk about selling it off, reducing services and raising fares of late... \n\nFinally, I don't think it's right to teach our young people that it is okay to steal services and to damage property through misuse... Maybe I'm wrong, but kicking the can down the road doesn't start to solve the problem. \n\nBut the reaction of this guy got me wondering?

I probably would have said something prior to this. Especially with places like Morrisons having an area at the front of store to pick up free essentials when in need.)", "Fair.

It wouldn't be pleasing to me at all... I just meant that I would and have actively helped anyone in that situation. I hate to see anyone in that position. There is also the TfL bus service which is free to under-15s and the area has better bus links than the tube. \n\nI'll not get involved in future. I should not have said anything and I accept this judgement.", "Yeah, the staff can't do anything directly unless an enforcement officer is at the station or police happen to be there. At most they could check the barrier to see if it needed maintenance again (it stopped working - having had to make a quick trip this evening, it has been taped off yet again, unfortunately) but TfL isn't in the best spot funding-wise. The only enforcement is limited and clustered around zones 1 and 2 (understandably).\n\nI won't tell you it wasn't because, as much as I didn't know what, if anything, would be done beyond continued monitoring, I think anyone reporting something like that is, at the very least in part, self-gratifying. I don't know if I would use the word smug. It felt like the right thing in the moment. But after I was not so sure and now, having read more responses, I understand it was not (and why most people don't speak up about anything anymore). It is better to not get involved.\n\nThis is reddit... While anyone may hope not to be 'attacked', as with anything online, it can be expected. At the end of the day, barring a couple of messages, I think everyone replying has made very valid points and given me a clear stance to take should I see the same thing again in future. I'm a big girl. I can handle some justified vitriol levelled my way (though, the guy shouting set off a lot of issues I've been working on, so maybe not so much in person just yet).", "Thank you for responding.\n\nI didn't speak to the girls at all and would not interfere directly. Nor did I demand on any action being taken. It was more an FYI to staff especially given the persistent barrier damage (This prevents wheelchair/pushchair access to the station entirely). \n\nThat said, your judgement makes sense. I'll keep my head down in future and not say anything. I don't want to put anyone in harms way. I shouldn't have gotten involved.", "It WAS your place to raise it. Do not listen to any YTAs. As a society it\u2019s our job to help keep it civilised. Stealing and vandalization have no place in a civilised society. Their personal situation doesn\u2019t matter. Just because someone is in a shitty situation doesn\u2019t mean they can commit crime and it be okay. \n\n\nStealing adds up and results in higher prices for everyone. Vandalisation results in lost money for repairs, higher prices for everyone and stricter controls on everyone bc a few assholes can\u2019t behave. Unless they learn the lesson and face consequences now, they\u2019ll just become an even worse menace to society later.", "Sounds like your city didn\u2019t think their public accommodations through. If your door isn\u2019t tough enough to withstand being held open, perhaps it wasn\u2019t an ideal design. \n\nDon\u2019t be a narc. \u2728", "It sounds like the commenter you are replying to is in the US or somewhere else where homeless people are criminalised to a greater degree than in the UK. In light of that, you not saying anything about people sleeping outside isn't all that important, because socially if you tried it, the police are unlikely to do anything about it other than tell you to mind your own business. Which is what you should have done in this situation as well.", "This is why I love that the buses are free for kids year round... So they can travel when needed, regardless of their situation.\n\nI think my biggest takeaway from these comments though is something we all know... TfL needs better funding so this can be enforced properly or barriers can be upgraded to prevent forced openings. Rather than a member of the public speaking up where nothing can really be done. \n\nI didn't achieve anything with regards to the girls learning something from this. I didn't speak to them. If they cannot learn these lessons publicly, then I have to continue to hope that addressing what we can in school/with parents will prevent that. (Yes, kids at my school have been sanctioned for similar stunts at the station by the school. SLT now have someone on duty at the station before and after school to prevent further issues there.)\n\nI don't know. I understand your point and is solidly where I would have placed myself before this evening, but I also understand where others are coming from. \n\nI also understand more now why people don't speak up for anything seen/heard or to help/intervene from these comments. It's not the way I would like society to trend but it is the one we live in. One person isn't going to change that.", "They are perfectly well designed. No automatic closing door is designed to be held or forced open against the motor drive. \n\nIt's not about being a narc - it's about people not destroying infrastructure that disabled people need to use. They can jump the barriers, or run through after another person, until the cows come home and nobody will care. But if they start selfishly damaging accessibility gates then all my sympathy has gone. OP wasn't reporting anyone because of fare dodging, he was reporting people damaging the station. \n\nBeing broke doesn't give you the right to break stuff that the rest of us rely on.", "From my experience at uni, at most the police direct vulnerable homeless to a shelter that might have space that night if it's particularly cold or direct Shelter volunteers to clusters where they can offer the most help. It's incredibly sad that some places criminalise the homeless to such an extent. Shelters are full, emergency housing has incredibly long waits... Most of those you meet on the street appreciate some food, a hot drink or even just some time and company. They don't need to be treated as criminal os for existing. It's heartbreaking that people still end up in such a position and I don't see the value in a few people gaming the system (like those that brag about how much they can make 'begging') stopping anyone from helping *when they are able to*. \n\nTo your last sentence - I understand that now and will do in future.", "You\u2019re mad at individual poor people for scraping where they need to. \n\nYou should be mad that your city puts up gates against the poor and then convinced you that it was to help you. \n\nAn open door answers both of your needs. Perhaps the blame lies with those who decide to lock them to begin with.", "You are totally missing what I have said repeatedly about there being easy and non-harmful methods of dodging fares, by jumping barriers or following people through them. \n\nI am not mad at people scraping by. I am mad at them for choosing to vandalise the gates as a way of avoiding the fare. \n\nThere are real questions as to how transit should be funded, and whether a gated approach to payment control is more Draconian than a policed approach. \n\nBut none of that is relevant here - these kids are needlessly damaging gates, when that is not necessary to skip the fare. I don't get why you are so invested in them being utterly blameless, when their behaviour is objectively anti-social."]}
