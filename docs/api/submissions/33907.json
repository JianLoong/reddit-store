That's a perfect gift for literally anyone and needing to be special or favorite and get more than someone else is a wild red flag.

That says a LOT about your sisters parenting if she's raising her child to believe that she's owed more than anyone else, but nothing about you.

It\u2019s actually a great opportunity to pull up with Mia and see if she\u2019ll open up about her perspective, and for you to hear out her feelings and reinforce that you love her (not more than her cousin, but it just seems like she\u2019s feeling a little discounted).  \n\nAt 9, Mia is likely starting to feel less like a kid and getting the same exact gift as her younger cousin might lead her to feel like she\u2019s still considered a little kid. I can also see a perspective where she doesn\u2019t feel like the gift was reflective of anything uniquely her.  A 6 year old, otoh, might feel more grown up because she got the same gift as an older child.  A 3 year age difference starts to be more significant probably around their ages and less so as they become older teens.  \n\nNone of this is to say you gave them bad gifts!  The cookies sound lovely!  I just remember being around that age - where I started to consciously understand gift-giving as a way to express knowledge of another person\u2019s interests, which is a demonstration of caring - and getting nice things from well meaning relatives but also feeling like they were generic \u201cgirl gifts,\u201d especially if another relative was given the exact same thing.  It was nice to be remembered, for me, those generic gifts didn\u2019t have a lot of meaning for me personally and were an indicator that they were just checking my name off on their list.  Mia may be feeling a little of that.  And feelings are neither good nor bad, they just are. \n\nNow, if her mom\u2019s response indicated she agreed with Mia or included something like \u201cwhat are you going to do to make it right,\u201d then she is TA.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you went to some time & effort to make the gifts.

Her mom should be ashamed for raising her like that.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s 9 so there\u2019s hope, but your sister should have explained to her child while her response is not ok and left you out of it.  \n\nYou did the appropriate thing by giving them equal gifts.

All cousins are the same, giving one more or better leads to resentment.", "I think the older child needs a dash of reality sprinkled on that entitlement she\u2019s carrying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. This is precisely why when buying gifts for my grandbabies, I always consider so many factors. I often give *gifts* of no money value, like baked goods and soups and stews because I know my son struggles and his wife cannot cook. I also provide help financially when it is needed. Home cooked/baked food is a goddamn blessing. Someone cared enough to spend time, specifically making something special! This year I was also able to make a  blanket for my newest grandson and a big boy blanket for my oldest grandson and a baby blanket for my granddaughters baby dolls (I crochet). The older daughter (and mother)  are wrong. No shame in heartfelt, homemade gifts.", "NTA\n\nThe gift was age appropriate to both kids. The mom is extreme ah for encouraging this behavior. Age would be relevant if say you got them both CandyLand and it\u2019s not an appropriate gift for the older one.", "NTA. Mia is entitled and your sister indulges that behavior. She can have that feeling and speak with her mom, who should have a conversation explaining how it's a selfish and entitled complaint and that's where it stops. Don't feel bad and don't enable a brat.", "NTA. You did treat Mia as special when you took the time to make home-made themed cookies. True, you similarly treated Zoe as special, but that doesn't detract the thought which went into the themed cookies Mia received.", "NTA, neither are the kids. The mother is for not handling it herself.", "NTA.  Mia's Mum should never have spoken to you about this in the first place.  She shouldn't be encouraging her child to think being older equals getting a bigger, better present.  Also, encouraging her thinking that she is the favourite niece is out of order.", "Mia is being a little brat and her parents are condoning it. That was a sweet and thoughtful gift. NTA", "NTA, there are none here.\n\nI wouldn't have thought that a 6 year old and a 9 year old were far enough apart in age that a dozen cookies for each wouldn't be appropriate.  I have kids, and didn't differentiate between them to that degree.\n\nMia is a kid, they get to feel the way they feel and show it as long as it isn't too disruptive.  Sounds like it wasn't, and she was able to work it out with you.\n\nThe sister could have been an AH had she came to you in an accusatory fashion or supported her daughters hurt feelings, but it sounds like she just explained the situation to you.  \n\nBased on the story here, everybody is just fine and Christmas was saved!", "Whoa! NTA! It is time that Mia realizes that she does not deserve anything different or better than her cousin.", "NTA at all. and tbh if you'd given mia a gift that made her feel more special and like she was your favorite, you would've been an AH.", "NTA. Why would Mia get more cookies for being older? What makes her think she\u2019s supposed to get unfair treatment?", "NTA, but your SIL surely is and she is teaching her daughter to be one, too.", "I totally get her. I got some products my SIL made, and I got the same amount as my other SIL who is 3 years younger than me (I'm 37 and she's 34).  \n\n\nKidding. This is ridiculous. How embarrassing for an adult to go and \"confront\" an 18 yr old for something like that. Wow.", "So basically, Mia told her mom that she deserved more because she loves you more, and mom agreed. \n\nI would let these two work it out for themselves. If you address it like it is a real issue, it becomes more real to them. I would just say \"how would Zoe feel if she got less? I didn't make them cookies to make either of them feel bad. I didn't know Mia felt entitled to more than others\". Then I would add in that sis should work on that before it affects Mia's ability to maintain friendships later in life. \n\nFrom there, they can chose to be narcissistic or chose to treat people how they want to be treated. But you were right to keep it equal!", "NTA. This is Christmas not a birthday. I can't blame the kid for sounding so entitled and princess like considering it has to be the parents that are raising her this way. Being an only child can be hard when said child gets everything they want and it comes time to share or be treated equally as they usually are treated like the only girl/boy in the world. But again it's up to the parents to teach their kid(s) that just because mommy and daddy may spoil them to death doesn't mean someone else should have less or that they should always have more. I would've sat her down and told her this. Wspxually bc Christmas isn't about gifts or who has what better or who got the most expensive thing. It's about being with loved ones. Mother should've explained tht to her kid instead of trying to get OP to bend to what her niece wanted which was ultimately \"I get more and better bc I'm older and special and the favorite\"", "Mia's mom is a rude cow and it seems to be rubbing off on Mia.", "NTA. What disgusting behavior. Mia needs to be socialized soon", "NTA, and it's WEIRD that Not only does the child believe you being HER favorite aunt should automatically mean she's your favorite niece and should therefor get a bigger/nicer Gift from you, but also that her PARENT confronted you about it and brought absurd reasoning into it. Being quantitatively fair in Gift giving for children a GOOD Thing to prevent rivalry,  because the one who received less feeling left out is supposed to be seen as worse than someone not being treated as Special as they feel entitled to. Also there is no reason to justify why a 9yo should get more sweets for Christmas than a 6yo. (It's MAYBE sort of reasonable that a toddler who is physically much smaller so gets mood-altering sugar rush from a smaller amount, or an adult who is supposed to be proud of valuing \"Moderation\", would get less sweets than either a 6yo OR a 9yo)", "NTA - Mia is just being a typical kid with her kid logic. They think they are getting the shorter end of the stick because their younger siblings will get something better when they are older.\n\nJust tell Mia you love the siblings equally, but when some gifts are age universal, you are expected to make things equal so that the younger one doesn't get upset. Since she is the older sibling, they will be the wise one who may have to sacrifice her age privilege to help the adults have less crying kids to parent.", "NTA; your sister is risking raising an entitled brat.", "NTA\n\nMy kids both got exactly the same things from their uncles - a Cadbury selection box and either \u00a310 cash or \u00a320 gift card.\n\n9 year old B doesn't like milk chocolate but isn't upset that she got them, or that 4 year old N got the same selection packs as her (although I did buy B some sweets the next day, to make up for it).  She's more excited about spending her money.\n\nB was more upset when she thought N had gotten more for Christmas from my parents - my parents gave N a set of colouring books and a pack of pencils, B got a spirograph set and a full ream of paper.  Both girls got a giant LOL doll, B had an aquabead set and N had an LOL vet set.  More Cadburys for both, but I knew in advance & had a white chocolate selection pack to swap straight away.  Similar amount spent on both, same number of presents each.", "NTA. Reading the title I was prepared to swing the other way. For instance if a 3 year old niece received some Paw Patrol toys and her 12 year old cousin got identical Paw Patrol toys, not so great. This was a cute thoughtful age appropriate gift!\n\nI also have many niblings and their gifts are of roughly equal value, I wouldn't think to give the older ones \"more\" than the younger ones?", "NTA - Your sister comes from a big family so she has enough experience to know that you don\u2019t get different amounts of food in gifts. She\u2019s raising a brat and she\u2019s going to regret it when that brat hits her teen years.", "NTA. This was a teachable moment, and your sister completely flubbed it.", "NAH. Mia is likely not sad that she didn't get more cookies or the other niece didn't get less, she's upset because you're her favorite aunt and you got the nieces the same gift which made her feel like she wasn't special to you. She's nine, she's just bad at figuring out why she feels the way she does. \n\nHomemade cookies are a great gift, especially for a broke college student, but I do have to say that sort of gift doesn't feel to kids how it feels to adults. If the kids get homemade cookies, they were never the ones to put the work in-- or if they did, baking was a fun game. So theres no \"oh i get to have delicous homemade cookies but didnt have to do the work\" that adults appreciate so much.

The mom would've came up to you and asked why you gave Mia more cookies as the younger daughter is upset. \n\nEither way, lose-lose situation. \n\nMia's mother is TA in this situation. She should've told her to be appreciative. It's unfair for one child to be treated differently than the other. You gave them an equal gift.", "NTA.\n\nMia's parents are on track to creating an unpleasant child and terrible sibling dynamic.", "The mother should have shut this down. Her being older does not entitle her to more.", "NTA it's food nothing to complain about and they barely have a age difference", "NTA.\n\nYour niece's reaction is very typical for that age. She thinks that her sister is a \"baby\" and she is so much older and more mature and that everything should reflect that.\n\nHer mom should have taken her aside and given her a little talking to.", "The day that a pre-teen niece or nephew starts giving me shit will be the day I cease being a Favorite Uncle.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Mia is a brat.", "Absolutely, positively NTA!!  \nYour sister is the AH for entertaining such an entitled attitude and major AH for missing out on a perfect teaching opportunity. How would Zoe feel about being treated as the \"lesser\" niece? Of course they should be treated the same in this situation.", "NTA - Mia\u2019s mother obviously thinks *her* child should get special treatment over her cousin, and has obviously told Mia as much because why else would she be upset? By giving them the same gifts (which, as a 28yo, I would have been THRILLED to receive btw), you communicated to both Mia and Zoe that that\u2019s not the case, at least in your eyes. I\u2019m guessing that Mia\u2019s mom is always dismissive and rude towards Zoe; prioritizing your own kid is one thing, but she doesn\u2019t get to demand that other people do the same. If your title as \u201cfavorite aunt\u201d is contingent upon her getting special treatment from you, it\u2019s not worth holding onto lol\n\nW Aunt moment", "NTA- they better nip that in the bud now. Lol", "NTA \n\nher mother on the other hand, should have talked through this with Mia so she understands the importance of 'sharing' / 'equal treatments' \n\nI mean her mother should probably have handled certain things differently beforehand if Mia expects this kind of entitlement (and no blame to her, she's a kid who's just dealing with life as she's learned to).", "NTA By this reckoning, Mia will always get a better gift because she is older. If it were an age dependent gift, it would be different, but it isn't, so Mia's mom is raising her to be an entitled little AH in a few years. By this reckoning, it wouldn't be just gives either. Mia will always get a bigger piece of cake, a larger slice of pizza. Can't you see her at 30 doing the same thing? \"I get first dibs on the vacation condo beds because I'm older.\"", "You didn't do anything wrong and your sister should have told Mia she shouldn't expect more cookies just because she's older. Your sister is raising Mia to be a brat. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nBut your sister is for not nipping your entitled niece in the bud.", "Are you worrying about gift giving etiquette based on the behavior of a 9 year old?", "NTA. Socks and batteries for Mia next time since she wants to be an adult. That\u2019s what my parents put in my stocking, among other things adults might use, like a fancy sewing kit, and I\u2019m not going to lie I was super content with it.", "NTA. Your niece is just a kid so maybe she has an excuse but her mom should understand that you are being fair and kind by doing identical or equal things for your niblings. I have a niece and nephew and make a point of giving them a similar dollar amount of gifts for Xmas or birthdays. I don\u2019t have a favorite nibling and I\u2019m not going to show favoritism. I know how much that sucks to feel like you\u2019re the least favorite.", "NTA.  \nI was honestly expecting it to be something like they were 13 and 23 and you bought them both a 'my first make-up kit' or similar.", "nta\n\nyou should give her MORE cookies because she's older?  That's not how gifts work\n\nWill she expect you should in future buy her more expensive gifts because she's older? Again, not how that works.\n\nIf this is typical behavior on Mia's part, I would just say she's old enough not to get gifts.  I don't give truck to enabling selfish greed.", "Tell her you love both of your nieces equally and that you don't pick favourites. It wouldn't be fair on Zoe for her to get less just because you favour Mia, and likewise, it wouldn't be fair on Mia if you decided to favour Zoe. She is just a kid and she is being petty and selfish about it, just calmly explain that it is only fair they get the same and that is that :) She likely won't even remember it as she gets older, kids get upset about the most ridiculous things sometimes\n\nEdit: NTA lol", "NTA\n\nIt's a really nice gift.... for anyone of any age.  It had a specific theme where 12 cookies is the optimal number to give.\n\nSounds like Mia is learning this at home.  I'm not sure what Mia's mom is teaching her and how but it deals seem like she thinks she's now an 'adult' or at least needs a more mature present than her 6 year old cousin.  Is there a competitiveness between the two mothers?  Or between the two girls ie does the 6 year old always want to play with the 9 year old regardless of what she's doing?\n\nThis is not really about the cookies but something underneath.  \n\nThe present is no different to buying them each the same box of chocolates (but with more effort and thought).  But that might have been a problem too.\n\nI guess the lesson from this is to not give them the same present regardless of how appropriate it might be.", "NTA, Mia is acting like a child her mother should have told her be thankful for what she has and it\u2019s not a competition. Her mother needs to get her head out of her a$$ and parent her.", "NTA, but I can see why Mia is upset. It\u2019s not about \u201cI want more cookies\u201d (even if it comes out like that; kids aren\u2019t very good at parsing their emotions), but wanting to be seen as different from her little cousin. Next time, just personalize the cookies in their favorite colors! It\u2019ll go a long way \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA", "I\u2019m 33 id have loved that gift lol.

That doesn\u2019t mean one gets more than the others because you are their favorite.  \n\nIt means they both should grow up knowing you care for them and will be there for them equally.  In short there is no golden child. \n\nI think the baking of the cookies was a great idea and hopefully next year there won\u2019t be any confusion.", "NTA\n\nThe 9 year old being upset? Typical kid behaviour, no biggie. The mum coming to complain to you??? That makes her the AH. \n\nShe should\u2019ve dealt with that herself and told her not to be greedy. You were doing what good adults do and treating the kids equally.", "NTA: You were fair and it will help her learn that being older doesn\u2019t mean special privileges", "NTA and your sister grossly missed a parenting opportunity and was rude about your gift.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't say Mia is being petty, I would say she's behaving like a 9-year-old. She will honestly get over it before too long, and her mom should be encouraging her to get over it. (with positive vibes, like \"it's ok to be disappointed. But remember: our feelings are our own, and we're the ones who manage them. So how can we manage our disappointment here? Maybe we can ask if we can do makeup with her? How does that sound?\" This is assuming OP's sister knows about these techniques for helping children understand and regulate their emotions, but I'm trying to be the most positive here.) BASICALLY it's not OP's job to manage Mia's disappointment, it's her mom's job to encourage her. And in a few years she'll realize how petty it is to be mad over \"not having more cookies than my sister\". The goal is to help her move past it before \"a few years\" passes.", "NTA it's absolutely ridiculous to complain about equal treatment", "Agree completely! It can also just be a side effect of having siblings/cousins you feel competitive with. My siblings and cousins definitely did this to each other, and it's certainly a trope we see in media. But Mia, as you said, is old enough to learn from this if her mom would actually be a parent and talk to her. Her mom can acknowledge her feelings while also explaining that she should be grateful, etc.", "This exactly.", "I will second the NTA and the part about Mia. She is about that age where hormones start to come into play. I teach middle school and I can confirm in Mia's mind you treated her like a young child and she isn't 6 anymore. She wanted to be visually treated like an older kid. Mom needs to work on her choice and Mia might need a little chat too but I understand where she is coming from.", "It\u2019s honestly embarrassing that this was even brought up to OP at all. This was a good parenting opportunity completely wasted.", "She's not a horrible brat, and I totally understand her emotions, as I had an older sister, but we were still close in age. She HATED anything we got together that didn't acknowlege she was the older sister. Or if I did something earlier than she did or was allowed to (such as, I stole my dad's razor and shaved my legs when I was 12--my sister didn't bother doing it until she was older, but she threw a fit when my mom wasn't mad at me. Other than the stealing the razor part.) \n\nAnyway, point being--they're cookies though. And apparently of the twelve days of Xmas. Was the younger girl supposed to only get the six days of Xmas? She's being a bit ridiculous and needed to be reminded as such.", "This is a perfect example of what's slowly happening to kids today. (I sound old cause I am. Next, I'll refer to you all as \"young'uns.\")\n\nLife is full of moments that people deem unfair, no matter what the age; it's all dictated by the emotional maturity of the person in question. Certain kinds of parents are taking that process and screwing it up by stepping in, not allowing the feelings to develop and be expressed, and immediately claiming their kid is being wronged, or is special or should somehow have a different outcome in a given situation. The terms helicopter and lawn mower parents is apt, and it's creating monsters.", "I'm child free (and plan to stay that way) but I also love gentle parenting. I have always believed that children deserve to be respected as human beings and that they can be engaged with in a manner that is both respectful and developmentally appropriate. \n\nBut you're totally correct. Some people have taken \"gentle\" to mean \"shield from all consequences and discomfort\" (which is, obviously, not what is actually meant by \"gentle parenting\"). Uncomfortable emotions are a part of life and it's essential to learn how to deal with them. \n\nI honestly think the parents in these stories don't, themselves, know how to manage jealousy, anger, disappointment, or whatever other difficult emotion. If their own strategy is to blame others any time they're unhappy, it would make sense that they teach their kids to do the same.", "Honestly I think she would be TA if she did give more to the older niece because the older niece is always going to be older. Maybe it's because I'm the youngest person in my family but I still get a cot in the office for holidays because I'm the youngest. I'm in my 30's.  Even before my siblings had spouses this was happening. It wasn't being younger and smaller because I've been the biggest sibling since I was like 12.", "Exactly(on cookie quantity).\n\nWhen OP does have money, this kid will be expecting double the money the younger one gets(unlike the fact that many relatives will send out gift cards or in the olden days cash tucked in xmas card--in the same amount for all the kids).\n\nAlso, tho i'm not an advocate of the \"it's(always) the thought that counts\", Sometimes you suck it up and just say thanks.  My Grandmother NEVER remembered which \"favorite\" colour her TWO grandchildren had.  No writing it down or something.  SO every year sibling got something in my fav. color and vice a versa.  Did I complain, No.  Did sibling? No", "And she also wasn't particularly rude about it, just wasn't super enthusiastic about it. That's a pretty mature response for a nine year old! \n\nI was the oldest in an age set and while I was generally a good kid, I realize now that I picked fights with my younger sister when I didn't feel like I was being treated as an individual. She was close in age and about the same size/bigger than me, so people always assumed we were twins and treated us the same. We both acted out against each other because of it, though it was never super serious. Kids are just oblivious assholes sometimes.\n\nThe mom, on the other hand, was super immature.", "I mean, I hate going back to the obvious.. but older cousin IS still a little girl. This is on her mom to be a mom and not try to pander to \"Waaa I deserved more!\" OP is absolutely NTA, although the sister/niece are little shits.", "It IS about the cookies. A 6yo would be filled up by fewer cookies than a 9yo, so the 9yo technically received a smaller gift by proportion. I don't make the cookie laws here.", "Or even just different boxes.", "Exactly my point. She's 9, it's normal to be upset about stupid things. It's her mom that is entitled. Not her.", "Gentle, compassionate parents are rearing gentle, compassionate kids. Shielding and making the kid a center of universe isn't a good, gentle parenting.", "NTA. What nonsense and poor parenting!!  Mom of 3 here.  There are times when gifts are either equal or FAIR. There are times when only one child receives a gift. It is the PARENT\u2019S JOB to teach their children the difference and learn to gracefully accept whichever situation it is\u2026no matter the ages. Obviously, the lesson should be age appropriate. NO MATTER WHAT THE AGES (including adults!), whenever cookies are the gift, EQUAL distribution is the ONLY way to gift!!!", "NTA. As a mom of a 16 year old, I feel so sad that the 18 year old was considered an adult and did not get presents. 18 is so young. My 18-year old neighbor is home for his first Christmas break, so we made sure to bring over a Christmas card with cash. That's a hard age to be responsible for so much.", "NTA. Gifts should be equal though not required to be identical. No reason to give Mia more because she's older. That smacks of entitlement as foes the implied threat yo demote you from favorite aunt if you don't comply.", "NTA.\n\nMia's mother's raising her to be one, however.", "NTA - this is a great opportunity for this kid to learn that it would have been seen as unfair by the younger girl or less valued or important to receive less cookies. I have a niece and nephew and although they don\u2019t get the same gift we always spend the same amount of money on them to make it fair.", "NTA\n\nAgree with top comment, that Mia isn't the problem as much as her mother is. Her mother (/father) should have talked to her about (1) how much love and time you had put into making such beautiful cookies for both her nieces - and that she needs to appreciate that, (2) that she is only hurting herself if she tries to bean-count and compare gifts, and (3) she is really hurting herself if she expects to be given MORE than someone else. If she's THAT grown-up, then maybe she shouldn't get a gift at all and be one of the gift-givers to the \"little kids\" or she can appreciate all the love she was shown by all of her family.\n\nBTW, your gift sounds so beautiful and thoughtful. I think any grown-up would have also been pleased to receive it. You are definitely a great aunt.", "NTA.. you can love her and she can find you her favorite but she's not entitled to \"special \" treatment just because she wants it", "NTA. I have many niblings and amazing relationships with them. Sometimes, kids can be kids and they get a little \"i'm the favorite..\" I am open and honest with them. I tell them that each of my nieces is special in their own way. I love that they are kind, smart, funny, and loving.  I would explain how much time and effort I spent. Then calmly ask why they were unhappy after getting the cookies. Kids will usually tell you how they feel. Listen, and reassure them.  You don't have to agree with what they said to make them feel heard.", "I'm a grown-ass man and if a family member gave me a tin of cute cookies as a gift I'd be ecstatic. Hard NTA.", "In what way is simply being a little quiet considered a tantrum", "Ha! Reminds me when Burger King came out with the \"big kids meal\". It had a double burger or a whopper jr in it, and I think the drink was a size bigger.

If it meant buying one kid a gumball it would be the same. I got wonderful leather driving gloves w cashmere lining one year. Marked down to $25 but her friend bought them w her store discount so they met the $20 limit.", "No. No. There's a formula that must be followed. The 6 year old got 12 cookies, so the 9 year old should get 18. If cookies are given to a 20 year old they should get 40 cookies. A 60 year old gets 120 cookies and so on. ;-)", "Younger cousin tho"]}
