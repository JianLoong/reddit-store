And I did warn him about it.\n\n\nTL;DR; AITA for looking a gift horse in the mouth, and making my boyfriend sad?

On the other hand I go through this with him every once in a while, and I don\u2019t like having to act grateful for things I dislike. A similar thing that happened was that he wanted me to try mushrooms and he insisted that they were better than acid. And kept going on and on about how I must admit I liked them better.

Relationships need healthy communication and mutual respect where boundaries are respected. Just because you have broad boundaries doesn\u2019t mean your bf can\u2019t respect the few you have. If he loves the crystal glasses so much then he should keep them and not force them on you.

Sounds like you guys live together, so he should be well aware that you put effort into the style of your home.  Despite the fact you were skeptical about the glasses, you were open into seeing and even keeping them. He got pushy and tried to turn them into a \u201cfree\u201d gift.  That puts you in an awkward situation because he was never open to you not liking them.  He should\u2019ve brought them over to see if you liked them first.

If he'd seen them, noticed they were to your taste, and decided to gift them to you that would be different. It seems instead that the fact that they were free and made of crystal was enough for him to ignore your objections.\n\nAlso, the source of these things sounds dodgy. Is his friend in a house clearing business? \n\nNTA. Ignore the people saying you're a brat. They are likely compulsive regifters.", "INFO: do you live together?", "How is this not handling stolen goods? You can't just take other people's stuff, dead or otherwise.", "Yeah honestly that\u2019s bang on the money. He also did it with this MLM perfume a while back but that was the perfume his late mother used. I didn\u2019t think it smelled bad at all and it wasn\u2019t hard in that situation to be moved by it and to tell him I was happy with the gift. But his presents and gestures often feel loaded like that. I know he just wants to make me happy though and that he probably feels rejected when I don\u2019t react with enthusiasm.", "Oooooohhhh! This!", "Yes, this. It is ok to have different taste, and if you guys stay together, he will have to learn to live with your stuff, and you with his. This includes ugly mugs and tacky toilet seat covers. \n\nOne thing though, ugly chunky old crystal can be very valuable if you know what you are looking at, and Eastern Europe produces some of the best crystal and china i  Europe. He might just have recognized it even if he personally is poor. At least google it and check the price on ebay before you say too much..\n\nNAH", "I know. He\u2019s honestly pretty great with everything I decide and choose. He moved in with me as a tenant (which lasted 2 days lmao) and he lived out of a suitcase.

That\u2019s why I feel like an asshole cause he does do this type of thing once in a while but otoh, he\u2019s a great guy and he\u2019s so nice to me.

I guess I can\u2019t put glasses on display in the bathroom though.", "The poor thing was kind of a joke but I guess a bad one. I\u2019m poor too. I just notice that some poor people think stuff is fancy when it isn\u2019t. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him I hated them right away, btw. I just did it cause he kept going on about them and how I must love them and how I must have changed my mind. And I was like, no, I actually don\u2019t like them, and it was annoying having to keep lying that I did.", "I agree with this. If OP hadn't immediately rejected them (and by extension, rejecting something her partner was excited about), I would say N A H, it's just differing taste. People are allowed to like different things; personally I know my taste is not for everyone, I love Gothic style and use Halloween decorations as year round decor, but I don't bash minimalists who only use light neutral tones in their house. OP, read up on \"emotional bids.\" Your boyfriend found something *he* liked, for free, and was excited about it and you immediately rejected it. That doesn't bode well for a relationship long term. Even if you don't like something, you have to respect your partner does like it, and it's a *shared* living space. Even if he said he's okay with you handling the decor, you need to allow him some input or he's going to turn into one of the those man cave guys because it'll be his only space to reflect his likes", "Lmao you are right! I guess I groaned internally a bit cause my ex MIL used to pawn off all this crap on me that cluttered up her house. Since then I always feel a slight wave of panic at the idea of getting things and having to give them a place.", "Wow, what an imagination people on Reddit have. I am certainly not, nor have I ever been, rich lmao.", "If the bf stays with her, it sounds like he will get no input on much of anything.

But what is a house clearing business and why is it dodgy? I\u2019m really curious cause I have never heard of that.", "He wanted you to wear the perfume his late mother wore?  Or maybe he wanted to have it as a memento, and he felt weird buying it for himself?", "\u201cHe just wants to make me happy\u201d\n\nAgain: he wants to make himself feel good by doing something he can claim should have made you happy, even though he didn\u2019t put an ounce of effort into it.", "Hopefully he learns to not get you gifts", "It's good for him to know not to buy you things", "You do realise that \"fancy\" is a matter of opinion, right? It's not like \"crystal\" that it either is or isn't. \"Fancy\", just like \"beautiful\" is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nAnd yes, joking that someone has bad taste because of their origin is a bad joke.", "TBH he also didn\u2019t know what they looked like, just that his friend was giving them to us.

I\u2019m pretty passive and my bf decides most things, and I like it that way.

So he\u2019s the one who has to get his way?", "Excellent input, anything else or is your ego soothed now?", "A house clearing business isn't dodgy - it's just a company that is hired by people to empty a house.  The house clearing business gets to keep whatever they want from the house.  Usually hired by people inheriting from a distant relative, or someone who bought a house 'as is'.  \n\nWhat I was thinking is that if he isn't in a house clearing business, then taking things from houses that are abandoned is illegal (as would be taking from houses where the owners are deceased).", "I think he wanted me to wear it so he could smell it on me. Because he lost most of his family and I think he misses her a lot.", "Well he just got me flowers and brownies so I guess he never learns \ud83d\ude43", "It\u2019s a bad joke because it could make others think that you are serious and make dumbasses think that that stereotype is true and means something bad. It\u2019s not dumb to shoot the shit with people you know if you have a certain background yourself and they do too. I don\u2019t think you understand what stereotype I was half-joking about. It\u2019s actually a thing for (mostly older) ex-communist people to think some tacky shit is the cream of the crop. But I like tacky shit myself, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fancy.", "Ah so he's a \"yay free stuff\" type of guy lol. Try to figure out somewhere they can go that suits both of you and apologize for \"yucking his yum\" as I like to put it. It's not a *huge* deal, but overtime it can slowly wear away at a relationship so it's important to be mindful of it, you know?", "Yes because that part is just not relevant and not true. I am not a spoiled brat. I spend like 3-4 hours a day in the kitchen making him food and I do everything in the house except on Sundays he sweeps and mops for me. And I also have my own income, even if it isn\u2019t much. It\u2019s really not a relevant comment but so typical of Reddit with the assumptions. I can understand thinking I\u2019m the asshole, obviously, but you\u2019re missing the mark here with the spoiled (rich) brat comment so completely.", "Ooh no I don\u2019t think he steals, lmao. He has a good paying and respectable job, he just has all these hobbies on the side. Just one of those people that are excited to exist. Everyone stays on the rught side of the law though.", "Oh dear. To me that is a red flag. One time hanging out at home with my son when his girlfriend came over. They greeted each other with a hug and a kiss and my son (with concern and alarm in his voice) said \"OH! You smell like my mom.\" His gf replied \"yes, I love the fragrance she wears, so I got some.\" He told her \"when I am getting romantic, I DO NOT WANT TO SMELL my MOM'S fragrance, that is just <shudder> icky.\"  I said \"oh dear, yeah, that is completely understandable.\"  So yeah, bf is creepy for that thing and ALSO for trying to manipulate your feelings because he thinks YOUR decisions on taste are NOT as VALID as HIS. Manipulating and creepy = ick factor.", "Yeah I guess you\u2019re right. I will talk to him and make sure he knows that I do appreciate the gesture and didn\u2019t mean to hurt him.", "Oh but I didn\u2019t think it was creepy. He just misses his mom a lot :/. She died and he doesn\u2019t really have anyone else in his life. I only wear it occasionally, I think it just reminds him of home to smell it.", "Hopefully your din dumped that psycho"]}
