My roommates (m&f) have a habit of leaving the front door of our apartment unlocked and unattended. I've mentioned many times it makes me uncomfortable unless someone is in the common area hanging out or something. If they're in the common area, I don't care.\nMy TV is out there for everyone to use. But with the door being unlocked, I have felt unsafe with it since I can't afford to replace it. The door being unlocked has happened so many times, and I finally told them that if it keeps happening, I'm going to have to move my TV into my room to have my own peace of mind. \nSince I told them that, it happened a good couple more times and I kept thinking to myself \"you know, it's daytime, they're getting used to it, one more chance,\" and I'd just locked the door and carry on. \nThe issue came when last night, everyone was in there rooms, I couldn't sleep. I got up around 4am to go get water. I walk into the living room (no one in it), and the door is unlocked. It was 4am. Way different then daytime. And that was my last straw. I immediately moved the TV into my room and didn't say anything. \nWhen asked the next day, I said \"oh the door was unlocked at 4am and no one was in here, so I felt safer with it in my room from now on.\" And there was some arguing saying it wasn't when I know it was, because I locked it afterwards, and then silent treatment.\nAnd I feel guilty because I don't want them to hate me, but I couldn't keep having my boundaries disrespected, as I've respected all of their's, and I don't feel safe having it at risk anymore. I feel like it was my right, and it's not even to punish anyone, it's just to protect my thing that I worked hard to purchase. \nAITA for moving it in my room?\n\nUpdate: Thank you to everyone who commented. It made me feel so much better. \n(1) I am in a year long lease with about 10 more months to go, so moving out isn't an option.\n(2) I lock my bedroom door constantly. Even right now as I'm in it. It is locked. And I've finally set up a camera in my room for when I leave.\n(3) I'm glad I'm not the bad roommate here. Im being made to feel like I am, which sucks. I've been told by a friend that I should try to \"keep the peace\" and \"be friends\" because I have to live with them, but tbh, (1) I've never blamed them. I gave many warnings and stated that it had everything to do with ME being anxious about the door being unlocked. And (2) if someone gets this mad/rude over someone setting a simple boundary, then why would I want them as a friend. As a roommate friendship isn't my priority; respect for each other (and each other's boundaries) is most important. (Also, this isn't the first instance of me setting a boundary and being treated differently after, so I started to think I was the problem). \n\nAnyway, thank you guys so much.

You were clear that leaving the door unlocked made you uncomfortable and what you'd do if they kept leaving it unlocked. You gave them multiple chances and they didn't care sbout your feelings enough to change their actions, so they can biy their own TV if they want one in the common room. My college roommate drove me nuts because she refused to lock our dorm room, even when she'd leave for class. I've watched too many true crime shows to not double check that my doors are always locked. I'd tell your roommates you're just trying to make sure you all don't end up like the 4 college students that were just murdered in Idaho USA in an off campus house. They sound like they could use a scare to learn to be more responsible.", "NTA  And it's not just the security of your property, but your safety compromised at night as well.", "NTA this is beyond worrying about just a TV, this is a major safety hazard. I can't imagine being a person who's just ok with the front door being unlocked at 4am, especially after being told many times it makes a roommate anxious. You did all you needed to let them know what was going to happen, they're the ones who didn't bother to either listen or care. If your bedroom doesn't have a lock I'd maybe invest in one.", "NTA. Only thing you could've done better was to pretend you didn't know where it went and that you'd been robbed. At least for a few minutes.", "Yeah, this. Also OP? Start thinking about when your lease is up. Time to find different quarters.", "I'm in a year long lease, so I'm here until next summer:/ \nI keep my room door locked constantly, whether I'm in here or not.", "Good call.", "Used to live in a situation like that except my roommates at the time kept inviting a ton of strangers over without anyone else home. We had some expensive equipment in there and like OP, couldn't afford to replace it. Got to the point we started asking for spare keys back and only those whose names were on the lease could hold a key. \n\nSo totally NTA. You stuck to your boundaries and now they know you mean business hopefully. I wish you luck with the rest of your lease \ud83d\ude4f"]}
