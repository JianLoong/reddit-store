Or taking the LSAT the next day after cramming for the exam all night? \n\nWill your husband rush to his side throughout his life to secretly take care of these menial tasks?\n\nI feel a better approach would be to help your son (with or without your spouse\u2019s assistance) to make charging a part of his nightly/bedtime routine, so that it eventually becomes \u201cmuscle memory\u201d to him, like brushing/flossing his teeth. Maybe creating some sort of a bedtime checklist for him could help (in a respectful, non-demeaning way lol; not by awarding gold stars posted on a refrigerator \ud83d\ude02).

The lesson is not minor at all.  It's reinforcing the idea that personal responsibility matters in life.  Our kids' school had a policy specifically about coming to school with your device not being charged.  There were certain exceptions in place, but kids that did not come to school with a charged device were reprimanded if there wasn't a good excuse.", "NTA. Tell son that if his computer isnt charged for school then he can take his charger with him. At least the school I work at lets students sit near an outlet so they can charge while they work.

No one, at least if he doesn't learn now.", "NTA your son is old enough to take responsibility for things like making sure his laptop is charged for school. By your spouse stepping in and fixing things for him they are not helping him learn how to be a successful and self sufficient adult. In fact they are teaching your son how to use weaponized incompetence to get people to do things for him. When exactly does your spouse think children learn about responsibility, do they think a switch will just flip when he moves out?", "He needs not to be coddled.  NTA", "NTA. What\u2019s spouse going to do in 18 months when he heads to college? \n\nBut, instead of just dropping the enabling, start by not plugging it in and instead having spouse remind son to plug it in each night.", "NAH. I have to say, as someone who works at a high school where every student has a laptop, that this is more common than you think. We have a charging station in the library, a cabinet with 8 chargers where students can park their laptops. The chargers cannot be removed from the cabinet bc whenever we lend one out it never comes back. A student needs to either charge their laptop at home or bring their charger to school - it's on them to ensure that the equipment they need is properly maintained.\n\nMaybe you could put the charger in his room? next to the door, or his bed? Your hib is not doing this kid any favors.", "YTA. It's arguably better for kiddo to do the charging, but I also think it's VERY minor in the grand scheme of things and not worth an argument. Your kid is doing well in school, relatively responsible, managing their own time, etc. There's no reason to suppose they wouldn't get into a charging routine if your spouse stopped doing it, but they seem not to mind and it's not a skill your kid is deficient in, so I don't think it's something you should try to force. \n\nI teach 17-18yos and it's pretty common and harmless for very responsible, mature kids to occasionally get 'babied' by their parents. Maybe dad packs their lunch every day, mom picks them up after practice instead of making them walk half a mile. Those same kids are also showing responsibility in other ways like cooking dinners for the family, volunteering, juggling homework and sports and a job, driving younger siblings around. \n\nThere's a balance between fostering independence and taking care of each other. If the balance is off in general, that's worth fighting for. But one single habit is not.", "NAH while it\u2019s a good opportunity for a life lesson on being self reliant it\u2019s also a chance to show how little kindnesses are built into relationships. That in a healthy relationship kindness and giving should happen but should never be taken for granted. If your kid otherwise pulls their weight and does well in school and treats others with kindness this is a place to gently point out or even wait for life to point out once they\u2019re in college how other people do things for us and give where they don\u2019t have to.", "NTA. Your viewpoint is a good one here. Particularly here:\n\n>But I suggested son is being done a disservice and being deprived of the opportunity to learn how to self-manage and take on the responsibility for himself.\n\nOr put in other words, to learn how to be a functional independent adult. Isn't that what all parents should be wanting to do?\n\nYour spouses viewpoint on the other hand seems a bit askew.\n\n>My spouse sees this as me meddling and trying to control a minor little thing that doesn't need to be a life lesson.\n\nHow is wanting to not do something for your child so that they can learn to do it themselves \"controlling\". Isn't it more a thing of relinquishing control?\n\nAs for the \"life lesson\" thing. Those happen whether we want them to or not. Because your son is not taking responsibility for this, the \"life lesson\" is inevitable. It is only a matter of when it happens, not whether it will happen. The only thing you are doing is being willing to allow it to happen now rather than at some nebulous point in the future.\n\n>Instead, spouse says they'll stop doing this only if our son does it for himself -- so spouse seems unwilling to not be the safety net.\n\n??? The logic of this confuses me greatly. \"I'll keep doing it until I don't need to.\"... How will they know they don't need to. Like, at what point in the evening do they know they need to? If your kid is still awake, how do they know that they've forgotten and will fail to do it themselves? Are they really going in and checking after your son is asleep? And how many times of doing it themselves will be adequate for your spouse to say \"I don't need to check this anymore?\"\n\nHonestly, I think the answer to that last is \"too many\". Too many for your son to gain the needed responsibility while still in your household.\n\nThe puts me in the mind of Maxim 70 of the 70 Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries.\n\n>Failure is not an option. It is mandatory. The option is whether or not to let failure be the last thing you do.\n\nMore life lessons are learned from failures than from successes. But in order to learn through failure, you have to have the opportunity to fail. If you are never given the opportunity to fail, how can you be expected to learn?\n\nOr putting it into the context here. How can a teen learn to be responsible, if they are never given the opportunity to have responsibility?\n\nRight now, your spouse is the one responsible for managing the charge on your son's laptop. He likely knows this. If he does, he is not going to change, because he does not have any incentive to do so.\n\nIn this one thing, even if in no other, your spouse is being a helicopter/snowplow parent. Hovering over your child, and dealing with this for him, so as to keep it from being an obstacle in his path to success.\n\nBut if they truly want him to succeed, they need to allow him room to fail.", "YTA - parents should be helping our children learn how to grow, but instead of just letting your kid suffer the consequences of being... a fucking kid... you could offer him some solutions.
