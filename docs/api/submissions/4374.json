You realize that just kills the vibe of it and makes it awkward.

And then you seemed to like that they were both competing for your attention (and if you suspect cyan is gay, then you liked that they both maybe were attracted to you).\n\nThen you left and they\u2019ve bonded.  Now you came back and the dynamics changed.  It\u2019s no longer wife + you and you + cyan.  Now there\u2019s a very real wife + cyan relationship you aren\u2019t a part of.

So after the comments I get the feeling that you don't understand or want to accept that now there is a bond between the two.

You should apologize to Cyan and discuss with both of them (separately) to understand their feelings.", "so, i think either 1. they have a romantic thing going on or 2. you said she didn\u2019t make any friends - sounds like that\u2019s her only friend. and that\u2019s why she darted to him, and all that. and it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s upset about it. you make it seem like she\u2019s annoying him, and like she\u2019s a burden. so, are you assuming cyan is just too nice to set boundaries or do you know that?? because when he called you an asshole it sounds like he genuinely cares for her. though.. how he cares for her.. i\u2019m not sure. like i said, it\u2019s one of two.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re having an affair. I think that she\u2019s probably gonna divorce you though since she now knows what it feels like to be around someone who doesn\u2019t hate her. You knew she was having surgery and you still left. You\u2019re one of those men who hates their wife and eventually starts getting weekly handy j\u2019s from a sw behind a Burger King. You sound insufferable. I\u2019m glad y\u2019all don\u2019t have kids.", "YTA. You're not jealous that your wife might have developed feelings for Cyan, you're jealous he might have developed feelings for her. You HOPE she's forcing him to spend time with her (because you assume nobody would genuinely enjoy your wife's company) because you hate the idea that he might like her more than he likes you. You are a horrible husband with your attitude about your poor wife's after surgery care. I hope she realizes she deserves better and dumps you for someone better.", "YTA for assuming that Cyan doesn\u2019t want to be friends with your wife. All this bullshit about \u201cprotecting her feelings\u201d is all about protecting *your* feelings. Cyan was upset when he left because you called his friend clingy and assumed he didn\u2019t want to hang out with her. You\u2019re jealous because you don\u2019t get to spend time with him.

All you do is talk shit and complain. You seem to expect that you can put your friend and your career above your wife and she\u2019s supposed to smile and accept whatever scraps of attention you see fit to give her. Of course she\u2019s close to Cyan now, he actually helped her and cared for her when she really needed it. But you never wanted them to get along, you seem to have wanted to be able to continue to push her aside for Cyan and have her be upset about it, but now she\u2019s happy to have him around and is friends with him in her own right. You\u2019re upset that your favorite way to hurt her doesn\u2019t work anymore.

Why are you projecting on your friend and speaking for him, as if he was a helpless child that can\u2019t stand up for himself? If he has a problem with your wife, he\u2019ll say so. Sounds more like you\u2019re jealous and hoping he\u2019s bothered by her attention.", "YTA so much I don\u2019t know how you can\u2019t see it. \n\nSo it\u2019s okay for you to be friends with Cyan, but not your wife? And you\u2019re not jealous of them bonding, but that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019re posting on Reddit? Because if they didn\u2019t bond there wouldn\u2019t be an issue, correct? You invited him on date nights with your wife, but HE doesn\u2019t know how to set boundaries? Sounds like you can\u2019t either because who wants a third wheel on a romantic date with their spouse (besides you apparently). \n\nYou literally cannot understand why they\u2019re now hanging out, are you threatened by her friendship with Cyan? Is it that you want to be the only important person in his universe? He should have eyes for no one but you? Because my guy, your post and subsequent comments are seem to say the same thing: you want Cyan all to yourself and now you have to share with your wife (who I\u2019m convinced you don\u2019t even like, given the way you\u2019ve talked about her throughout this entire thread).", "This is the most unwholesome love triangle I\u2019ve seen since I was forced to read Ethan Frome in grade seven", "I swear the more comments you write OP the more of an absolute asshole you are.", "So you shame your wife for not making any friends like you and then get mad/jealous when she finally sees Cyan the way you do? If you don't think they have a romantic relationship then what's the issue? You don't like being in her shoes. It wasn't an issue when you ignored her for Cyan.", "YTA - But only conditionally. If it comes out there was ever some sort of affair or anything like that, disregard my judgement. I\u2019m basing this strictly off of what you said.\n\nAnyway, the reason I\u2019m going with my verdict is because it sounds like your wife is clinging to him because the entire time you were away, she was in a very vulnerable place and he was the only one there for her. Things like that can make people bond very quickly and strongly. Aside from that, but if he\u2019s the only person she was really around during that time, she very well may have just gotten used to his antics, hence the flipped switch. And as far as treating him as well as she does, given the personality you\u2019ve said she has, it\u2019s entirely plausible that it\u2019s all part of her way of showing gratitude. Assuming their relationship is truly just a platonic one, I\u2019d let it go and let them be friends without the additional commentary.", "YTA - Has your wife started keeping Iranian yogurt stocked?\n\nYou realize they're at least emotionally intimate now  even if nothing has happened physically?\n\nEDIT: I'm not even sure why I wrote nta when all my responses to OP have come from the viewpoint of him not realizing his wife and Cyan are  at the very least, very close friends.", "Ok I won\u2019t say YTA but I also won\u2019t say your NTA you need to talk to your wife and Cyan", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren\u2019t/weren\u2019t there for her, you don\u2019t appreciate her, you didn\u2019t care enough to have date nights alone with her or be there to take care of her after surgery. He did all of that and more, when you wouldn\u2019t! Now he makes her feel special and appreciated while you act like there\u2019s something wrong with her. Obviously, you can see they have gotten close and have strong feelings for each other, and I think you\u2019re right to feel that way, and you literally pushed for it to be this way. He now has lost any respect for you because he sees how shitty you treat her and take your wife for granted. She is now being treated well and feeling good with another man. I mean, they\u2019re both done with you and honestly that\u2019s exactly what you deserve for being such an AH to your wife. Don\u2019t act surprised! Again, you asked for this and the only thing you can really do is learn from this. When you have a good thing, don\u2019t take it for granted. The way you talk about her being clingy and what not is really gross, you\u2019re going to wish she was still clinging to you. YTA. It\u2019s funny because all you did by saying that to him was show how insecure their relationship is making you and prove to him how much you don\u2019t deserve her, making him not feel so bad about falling for your wife.", "YTA for the way you talk about your wife, just to start with", "YTA. You wanted them to be close, now they are.

Cyan has seen how you treated your wife and didn't like it and has chosen not to be friends with somebody like that. His response at the party shows he is clearly frustrated with how you just don't get it. He is giving your wife the care and attention she deserves. Unless you switch things up soon, you'll have no wife and no friend.", "YTA. Do you even like your wife?\n\nEverything you describe about her is negative. Her wanting to have intimate alone time with you on date nights is PERFECTLY REASONABLE. Her feeling hurt that you prioritized Cyan over her and sent HIM to care for YOUR WIFE while she recovered from surgery is PERFECTLY REASONABLE.\n\nYou're being a horrible husband and a bad friend. Of course your wife has latched onto Cyan; she isn't receiving any love or support from you.", "I think something happened between them while you were away. I'd ask each of them separately if they have feelings for one another", "Tsk\u2026 your wife sounds terrible. Clingy, weird, silly. You should just leave. I know a guy who would be very happy.

I can\u2019t image her not by my side.", "That\u2019s ridiculous", "I never said any of that.\n\nI didn\u2019t prioritize a promotion. This promotion could literally change our lives. I had no idea how badly my wife would take her surgery.", "This right here! Agreed! \n\n1. So, have you tried hanging out with them together and bonding all three? \n\n2.

All of this right here. Also, if OP doesn\u2019t want to be the butthole, why doesn\u2019t he have a frank conversation about his feelings with his wife and his friend? You know, without assuming their motives or how they\u2019re feeling before/during talking to them.", "Yes! All of this.", "I\u2019m not jealous. \n\nMy wife hasn\u2019t said anything about me not being there in person for the surgery.", "No, I haven\u2019t brought it up to her only because she\u2019ll feel hurt that he\u2019s too awkward to say he doesn\u2019t want to be friends.", "You sound like my wife used to. She constantly accused me of choosing Cyan and my friends over her.", "Her surgery was planned before I left for right in the middle of the project. She wanted me to be there but it wasn\u2019t possible. She complained she couldn\u2019t do anything and was basically sobbing at me to come home. It was constant complaining no matter when I picked up the phone.", "No but he\u2019s clearly in love with Cyan", "He seems absolutely incredulous that someone would choose to spend time with her and enjoy her friendship. The only possible explanation is that she\u2019s so overbearing that he can\u2019t tell her to back off bc\u2026.? Reasons? Idk. \nHe already corrected you on that point when you shit talked your own wife to a mutual friend ( shitty in an of itself) so I\u2019m not sure why you won\u2019t just believe him that he enjoys time with your wife.", "Oh the tears! \nYour dad is awesome!", "I don't think they're there yet, but it's definitely headed that way, isn't it?", "hahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha", "Not funny", "Exactly my thoughts!!  But it could also be that they either developed......\n\na) genuine friendship\n\nb) romantic feelings\n\nc) brotherly/sisterly connection and she feels motherly to him\n\nHow are they together when you\u2019re with them?  Do they have stolen glances or do they act more like siblings or parental?", "I highly doubt it. \n\nFirst of all, my wife would rather dump someone than cheat on them. I\u2019ve seen all her texts with Cyan and there\u2019s nothing inappropriate.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m 95% sure Cyan is gay. He lets my wife put makeup on him, he loves cute things almost as much as my wife and he loves being called \u201cpretty\u201d by her. I\u2019ve never seen him date anyone.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s 5 years older than him which is pretty uncommon. It\u2019s probably more older sister or motherly feelings.", "I really hope OP starts seeing it this way", "Idk. I\u2019m really rooting for the three of them. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, it sounds like they\u2019re both into Cyan.", "Actually if you read his comments it gets WAY worse. To the point I actually think the lack of an affair makes him a BIGGER AH.", "Na reading the rest of his comments, I ship Cyan and OPs wife.", "What\u2019s Iranian yogurt?\n\nI don\u2019t really believe in emotional affairs sorry.", "That\u2019s how she acts with all of her friends.", "I feel like it\u2019s safe to say no-OP does not like his wife.", "Might want to check on some of the dudes comments he knew about the surgery before he left for 4 months and he had thought she could take care of herself. He called her weak and dirty and says he doesn\u2019t believe in emotional affairs. Cyan took care of her for 4 months.", "Have you ever been there for her?

And your only solution for helping your wife who had surgery, was to invite someone you knew she did not like (at the time) into her home, while she is VULNERABLE and ALONE, to help her.

Your actions and results say otherwise.", "You\u2019re actually a bad husband and person at that, in this entire post you complain about your wife like you hate her, but you act joyfully with your friend like he is perfect, do you even like your wife? There\u2019s nothing wrong with not having friends, why brag that you have one and your wife doesn\u2019t? You sound like a child who wants everything but wants to give nothing.\n\nIf you love your friend than marry him, but don\u2019t bash your wife and act like your perfect, it\u2019s like your happy to see her sad\ud83e\udd40\n\nYou\u2019re more sad about losing your friend than you were about your wife having surgery!

You didn't know at the start, but she told you when she wasn't coping and needed you. \n\nShe was begging to have her husband with her for help. All you could be bothered to do was push another man on to her who turned out to be supportive and caring to her when she was vulnerable.

She had to follow OP for *his* new job to a place where she knew nobody, so when her husband ditched her it was natural she would have some issues with Cyan, but being abandoned to heal from a surgery (which I doubt was elective bc why would she schedule it when she would be alone?) lead to her dropping the resentment and getting to be friends with Cyan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I'm wrong then that's egg on my face, but regardless OP is a major AH, not necessarily for making her move to a strange place and not being able to care for her after surgery, but CERTAINLY for ignoring her complaints about Cyan, getting pissy when he comes back to them having bonded, and for **assuming his wife was annoying his friend without good reason**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike we get it dude, you don't want to hang out with your wife.

You guys aren't related, he isn't financially dependent on you guys, you aren't his boss or have some other kind of power over him to make him spend time with either of you. If he is it is because he likes you two. You have to realize; he likes her now. And she likes him. They are at the very least real friends now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I went to work, my **wife packs Cyan a lunch too- and his is a lot better than hers or mine**. \"\n\nShe like him a lot and cares about his wellbeing over herself and others - that says a lot about how strongly she feels for him.\n\nCyan needs this or that or whatever. **She showers him with attention. My wife can be overbearing like that.\"**\n\nA lot of people, apparently Cyan, like being showered with attention and don't consider overbearing. Some people want to be with people who are like that - not you apparently - but it seems your friend is like that and your wife is too.\n\n\r  \n\"At a small party, I came with my wife and she immediately zoomed to Cyan and monopolized all his time. after he went to the bathroom, which was basically the only time she left him alone, **I pulled him aside and told him I knew my wife was clingy and it was okay if he kept boundaries. he wasn\u2019t obliged to hang around my wife.** I said it kindly. **He turned red, told me I was an asshole, and stormed away. He left without saying goodbye to anybody but my wife.\"**\r  \n\r  \nHe is mad at you. I hope you realize this - the person he is mad at is you because you insulted him and his friend (who also happens to your wife). That is why he didn't say goodbye to anyone but her. She was the only person in the room that mattered to him, and he didn't want to hurt her feelings. by leaving without saying goodbye to her. \n\n**\"AITA?\"**\n\nYes, YTA\n\n\"I told some mutual friends about this and most of them are on my side. They said Cyan didn\u2019t know how to stand up for himself, he was embarrassed.\"\n\nDid you tell them this whole story the same way you posted it - because I somehow doubt you did.\n\n **\"Cyan is still pissed.\"**\n\nAt you, Cyan is still pissed at you.

Then please come back and update everyone.", "How are you protecting her feelings?", ">If I didn\u2019t care about her why would I be protecting her feelings?\n\nYou're not.

Sounds like you read it very wrong and aren\u2019t that great at it. \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t ask if you know, I asked if you talked to your wife about  it.

YTA.", "That might originally why he did it but it sounds like he and your wife bonded. Likely in part because her husband refused to help her after her surgery.

Ironically it wasn't the larger incision that was problematic. It was the tiny one that went through for the drain. It was only 1/2\" at most but because of the location it went through multiple layers of muscle that moved differently from each other.
