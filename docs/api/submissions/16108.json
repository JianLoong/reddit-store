Ever since he was old enough (around 10 or so), he would make his own lunch or I\u2019d give him money to buy. This school year, however, he told me that he had a new friend \u201cSam\u201d who\u2019s mom, \u201cLinda\u201d often made lunch for the group. I thought this was very sweet and reminded him to thank her when he saw her. Leo spends a lot of time at Sam\u2019s house. Sam\u2019s family has a pool, Linda is always cooking great snacks or meals, etc. I never thought much of it. Linda is a super sweet woman. She\u2019s just one of those people with a kind, giving spirit. Sam\u2019s also a great kid. When he\u2019s over our place, he\u2019s always polite and offering to help. I\u2019ve seen him around his parents at events, he talks to them with respect. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s perfect by any means, but it\u2019s clear his family has a respectful dynamic that works for them.\n\nI admit, I am not one of those moms who cook like Linda. I will make dinner, obviously, but it\u2019s usually pasta or chicken. Lately, I\u2019ve been buying those meal prep boxes, since they\u2019re so easy. When Leo\u2019s had friends over in the past, I\u2019ve thrown some frozen appetizers in the oven or ordered a couple of pizzas. He\u2019s never seemed to care before. There have been a few times since becoming friends with Sam where he\u2019s asked me to cook something for his friends and sometimes I will, but if I say no, I hear \u201cLinda would\u201d. I\u2019ve shut that down, or I thought I did.\n\nOn Saturday, Leo told me he was having some friends over and asked if I could bake cookies. I said we had a couple packages of Oreos in the cabinets. Leo started on that his friends were going to want chocolate chip cookies. I pointed out we live right around the corner from a bodega, he can go grab either grab a package or make some cookies himself. Leo then asked what was for dinner and I said I would order pizza. He asked why I couldn\u2019t cook his friends something. I said I had a long work week and I\u2019m tired. He got an attitude and called me lazy, saying that Linda works too and she manages to make the family what they want.\n\nI told him once again, I\u2019m not Linda, and I won\u2019t pretend to be. The next part is where I may have screwed up. I asked if Sam ever spoke to Linda the way he just did me. Leo admitted no. I said yeah, because Sam respects his mom and appreciates everything she does for him. Clearly, Leo isn\u2019t as appreciative. Leo walked out of the room and his friends didn\u2019t end up coming over (his choice). He hasn\u2019t said anything to me since.\n\nI was venting about this to a friend and she said I was absolutely wrong for comparing Leo and Sam like that. She says I got on Leo\u2019s level and made him feel bad. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t think I explained myself well on our diet at home.\n\nI do not only feed my son processed food, chicken or pasta. The latter two were just examples to show that I don\u2019t make intricate meals. We eat a variety of things, most of it fresh, it\u2019s just not intricate meals like his friend\u2019s mom makes. It is when his friends come over, that I am ordering a pizza or serving frozen food as there\u2019s a lot of them, it\u2019s cheaper and easier.", "created_utc": 1682922800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134eq2c/aita_for_comparing_my_son_to_his_friend_after_he/", "score": 381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Comparing kids against their friends is a shitty thing to do and it messes them up (as I know from my own experiences) but what you said seems pretty fair in the context of the exchange. It would be a different ballgame if you were comparing your kid against his friend's talents or self-expression (clothes, hair), that is never cool.\n\nBut you may have come upon a teachable moment. Assuming you aren't a hypocrite and don't set impossible standards for your kid (like you don't get mad if he gets a B on a test), you could talk about it like: \n\n\"Look, I could bake cookies but I'm tired and I want some time just to chill out. You could have gotten an A instead of a B on the algebra test if you had studied all Saturday and Sunday, but I know that school is a full time job and I don't expect you to never relax or have fun. Nobody should be driving themselves to their breaking point just to be as productive as possible, it's no way to live.\"", "NTA. Based on details provided, you are a great mom. Comparing individuals isn't ideal, and your 16-year-old son has now hopefully learned this lesson.  You rock!", "Comparing him to his friend in relation to academic performance would be mean (e.g. \"Sam did much better than you in the last history test\"). But for his bad attitude to you? NTA.\n\nfor what it's worth I don't think Leo is an a-hole either, just a teenage boy and often they suck. You sound like you're doing a great job with him.", "NTA but kids this age compare themselves a lot to their peers. That's just how teenage is. He was comparing the food at Linda's place to his own and wished for more homecooked food to show off to his friends that his mom is also cool like Sam's mom.\n\nHe's not old enough to weigh he pros and cons and to be happy with how good he already has it. You, on the other hand, are a mature adult person who knows they have a temperamental teenager. You should've used some tact to address this issue.\n\nNot calling you AH. I can understand how hard it can be being a single mother. But the responsibility falls on you to address such problems in a healthy way. That being said, you need to teach your son to be a little grateful. He's clearly acting a little entitled.\n\nEdit: Edited a spelling error", "NTA, you sound great and 16 is a good age to be cooking, for friends, even for his mum.", "NTA.  You showed your son how it felt to be compared against someone, he didn't like it.  When things calm down, have a talk with your son.  You sound like a good mom.", "NTA. You could have handled better, but it is built up frustration and he is 16 so ultimately not unacceptable. I am a strong advocate for not comparing children and showing your children love and affirmation. However, it is a situation where he should be able to either cook/bake himself or accept take outs. \n\nI think you should apologise to him for comparing him to Sam, tell him you love him and sit down to talk to him about. Tell him that you are often stressed and tired from work and genuinely don't enjoy cooking, especially large meals for multiple people. Linda might, but you don't. If he, with or without his friends, wish to borrow the kitchen to cook or bake together as an activity then that is OK, he should just inform you before and clean up after. I think these are viable options.", "Is this real, because when I was 16 pizza and oreos sounds awesome, we wanted as much independence from our parents as possible, not expecting beef wellington and freshly baked cookies.", "NTA. My mum is a single mum. Growing up there were things she couldn\u2019t do as it\u2019s harder being a single mum. You\u2019re doing the job of two parents. I never compared her to my friends\u2019 mothers. It\u2019s just not fair. She did her best and she is a great mother. As I\u2019m sure your are too. Leo needs to be more appreciative. Maybe sit him down and talk to him about how you feel. Rn he\u2019s sounding rather unappreciative.", "NTA and he has an age where he can cook for himself and for his friends he wants something specific.

Please, do his future girlfriend a favor and remove those ideas from his brain", "NTA\n\nInfo though - is Linda a single mum, or does she also have a partner that she can share the emotional/ mental/ physical/ financial load with that allows her the joy of being able to / not as exhausted that she can cook and bake to her sons and his friends hearts desires. \n\nThis is something that you could also point out to your son.", "NTA. Your son is old enough to understand how to respect and appreciate his mom.", "Absolutely NTA. What you said to him did not even approach the entitled, mean things he was saying to you. He needs to learn women are not just there to be his servants.", "NTA your son is being a bit of a brat. It's natural to make comparisons but if he wants cookies he should make it. He'll be 18 in two years he needs to start maturing a bit.", "NTA but definitely talk to him about this and clarify why you said that. He\u2019s 16, he\u2019s old enough to learn to bake cookies himself, more than old enough to learn that the woman of the house isn\u2019t the only one who can sort things like this. Young enough to be very and reasonably hurt by what you said - but also old enough to understand that what he said hurt you and that it\u2019s unfair.", "I get where he\u2019s coming from so I\u2019ll say YTA.", "Nta  you got your point across .", "NTA. He was comparing you to his friends mum. You did the same to make a point. He is old enough to understand that and show you respect.", "NTA - but it is probably worth a follow-up conversation or 6 with him about different life choices & different personalities. \n\nIt sounds like the whole scenario is a useful coaching moment & something for the 2 of you to chat about in a \u201cnearly two equals\u201d way - maybe take him out for whatever easy/cheap treat meal you guys do together & bring it up. \n\nHe\u2019s about the right age to move from \u201cmum tells you\u201d, to \u201cmum is interested in your emerging adult view of the world & (while demanding basic respect in both directions) would like to hear what you have to say\u201d.\n\nETA: it can also cover eg \u201cI probably got a bit too defensive because it sounded like criticism of me & the way I\u2019ve raised you. But I\u2019m actually ok with my life choices & I didn\u2019t really need to be defensive. But I was tired & people generally don\u2019t act completely perfectly when they\u2019ve had a long week. So I\u2019m happy to apologise for saying what I did with \u201csnark\u201d (although I\u2019m not really apologising for the words / the concept behind them).\u201d", "ESH- your kids love language is obv acts of service", "Soft YTA since you are the adult and could have handled it a bit better. But honestly, I feel you. Parenting is hard, you cannot be perfect in your reactions all the time.\n\nTalk to him again about how his comment made you feel, apologize for your reaction and talk it out. Could  be a very good moment for the two of you. Good luck, OP!", "Im sorry but NTA. He fucked around and found out.", "YTA. You\u2019re the parent not the child, control what you say to your children when you\u2019re offended/upset. He\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s going to say things to intentionally hurt you. Is it inappropriate and time for a lesson? Yes. Is it appropriate for you to act like a teenager back? Absolutely not. \n\nAlso would it kill you to make one thing your kid asks for for his friends? How much effort do you put into your relationship with your son? He\u2019s constantly making bids for your attention and affection by asking you these things and saying yes sometimes will probably do wonders for your relationship with him. I know you\u2019re tired and that you don\u2019t have to do it, but every once in awhile it would be nice to make some cookies to make your son feel loved and heard.", "ESH.  But you only have so much more time to polish up some of the lessons you should be imparting to him.  One of these is that not everybody lives the same way.  Another is that you shouldn't be changing who you are OR asking the people who love you to change who they are to impress a new friend.  That's what he's doing here.  It's a classic case of *keeping up with the Joneses* and that is never sustainable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just take a breath, apologize for being mean to Leo and just have a discussion about how different people do different things and comparing people to other people is mean and disrespectful.", "Best response ever.", "I honestly thought I had taught him to be grateful. This behavior is fairly recent and I do think it stems from seeing a home so different than ours.", "We've gone over these things throughout his childhood. We haven't always had the newest whatever. I'm a single mom, so he doesn't have a two parent household like some people. We talk often about being grateful for what we \\*do\\* have and the grass always being greener.\n\nIt's not as if I've avoided these things for 16 years. It's why I'm genuinely surprised this is happening now. While a lot of his friends have two parents (even divorced) and have different lives, Linda and Sam's life is a lot different than ours and I think it's a bit jarring for him.", "When I was a teenager, I used to see friends' homes having much better stuff than the below average ones we had at home.

If she refused, that would be the end of it.\n\nSo I can understand that he wants to have some of the nice things his friends have but his behavior and the way he puts it across is unacceptable. So I guess you need to try a different method to teach him some manners. He's growing and so is his circle. So its gonna get more difficult. You'll just have to keep a cool head about it and still get your point across. You can't go down to his level no matter how offended you are. Be strict and stern though (it is very different from going down to a teenage boy's level).\n\nThis is just my opinion.", "I didn't mean to imply that you haven't addressed these...I said you have time left to polish them.  Clearly, he's fascinated with this kid and is going too far out of his way to impress him.  It happens to everyone at least once.  I'm sorry he's taking out his fears on you.  He fears not being good enough for this friend right now.  That's a hard thing to deal with.  Eventually, he'll learn how to relax or he'll see that a relationship should not come with so much anxiety.  He's listening to you, like he has with other things growing up.   \n\nIt's completely understandable that you lost your cool.  He was being bratty.  It happens.  \"Parents are adults\" for sure, but we're also not perfect.

My friend would get driven around by her mother.  Her mother would always be home when I'd be my friend's house, and there would always be a nice spread of food and soda.  Meanwhile, my parents would get home late, so if I had a friend over, it was just us and whatever lame-ass snacks I could cobble together.  The disparities in our households made it so that I never wanted to invite my friend over to my place.   I could invite my other latchkey kid friends over, but not her.\n\nBut!  I was around 17 when I began to notice something.  My friend was kind of a spoiled brat with her mother.

I waited for her mother to pull over on the side of the road and give her daughter the what-for, but she kept driving like nothing had happened.  After that, I stopped being so jealous.  I realized that I'd rather have a \"good enough\" mother with a backbone than a sweet, devoted mother without one.\n\nNot saying that Sam is anything like my friend.

Or she got really lucky with her interests way back and was able to study something that brings in a lot of money with little time working.\n\nEither way what your son is asking for in understanable but reality just doesn't work that way and I think both of you said things y'all shouldnt have.\n\nSo ESH but this is just a conflict not a war and you guys will be able to figure it out I'm sure.\nMaybe he can take over some of the housework so you have more time cooking or or you guys try to find a way to do meal prep together and you at the end do the majority of the cooking but he could go get the groceries or something like that.\n\nGood luck to you two! :)", "NTA.

You give him money to go to the bodega, or order pizza. He wanted something cool to impress his friends, and you're like \"we have some oreos.\" You could have spent more time explaining your situation, rather than \"what do you want from me? Effort?\"\n\nChocolate chip cookies are insanely easy to make. There are thousands of recipes online.

If you don't have the time, that's fine. If you're too tired, that's fine. It sounds like what he wants is effort.

When I went over to their houses, it was impossible not to compare how they had multiple gaming consoles, or like even multple rooms besides a kitchen and living room, or that their rooms were so big and ceilings so high.

And its not like shes giving him nothing (ordering pizza for his friends etc, I come from an only homecook household, so yay ordering!).\n\nSo he compares her (unfairly) to push her into a task she cant do right now (exhausted from work). She does the same to show him its not good to compare people with one another. Im saying as an alternative they could bake togheter (wow bonding time and a similar love language) and or cook with his own friends since his goal appearently is that they get a homecooked meal.\n\nAnd on that hand, because I just realised that. We dont know if he wants homecooked food because he likes it more or because he wants to show off that his mom can do it too etc (which is wrong?)", "Yea she should definitely be the adult in the situation and figure out where this is coming from. \n\nDoes he want her to show more interest in his life/friends? \n\nDoes he want acts of service to feel loved? \n\nIs it a competition thing? \n\nTeens don\u2019t ask for that type of attention without a reason."]}
