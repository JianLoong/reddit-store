Ever since he was old enough (around 10 or so), he would make his own lunch or I\u2019d give him money to buy. This school year, however, he told me that he had a new friend \u201cSam\u201d who\u2019s mom, \u201cLinda\u201d often made lunch for the group. I thought this was very sweet and reminded him to thank her when he saw her. Leo spends a lot of time at Sam\u2019s house. Sam\u2019s family has a pool, Linda is always cooking great snacks or meals, etc. I never thought much of it. Linda is a super sweet woman. She\u2019s just one of those people with a kind, giving spirit. Sam\u2019s also a great kid. When he\u2019s over our place, he\u2019s always polite and offering to help. I\u2019ve seen him around his parents at events, he talks to them with respect. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s perfect by any means, but it\u2019s clear his family has a respectful dynamic that works for them.\n\nI admit, I am not one of those moms who cook like Linda. I will make dinner, obviously, but it\u2019s usually pasta or chicken. Lately, I\u2019ve been buying those meal prep boxes, since they\u2019re so easy. When Leo\u2019s had friends over in the past, I\u2019ve thrown some frozen appetizers in the oven or ordered a couple of pizzas. He\u2019s never seemed to care before. There have been a few times since becoming friends with Sam where he\u2019s asked me to cook something for his friends and sometimes I will, but if I say no, I hear \u201cLinda would\u201d. I\u2019ve shut that down, or I thought I did.\n\nOn Saturday, Leo told me he was having some friends over and asked if I could bake cookies. I said we had a couple packages of Oreos in the cabinets. Leo started on that his friends were going to want chocolate chip cookies. I pointed out we live right around the corner from a bodega, he can go grab either grab a package or make some cookies himself. Leo then asked what was for dinner and I said I would order pizza. He asked why I couldn\u2019t cook his friends something. I said I had a long work week and I\u2019m tired. He got an attitude and called me lazy, saying that Linda works too and she manages to make the family what they want.\n\nI told him once again, I\u2019m not Linda, and I won\u2019t pretend to be. The next part is where I may have screwed up. I asked if Sam ever spoke to Linda the way he just did me. Leo admitted no. I said yeah, because Sam respects his mom and appreciates everything she does for him. Clearly, Leo isn\u2019t as appreciative. Leo walked out of the room and his friends didn\u2019t end up coming over (his choice). He hasn\u2019t said anything to me since.\n\nI was venting about this to a friend and she said I was absolutely wrong for comparing Leo and Sam like that. She says I got on Leo\u2019s level and made him feel bad. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t think I explained myself well on our diet at home.\n\nI do not only feed my son processed food, chicken or pasta. The latter two were just examples to show that I don\u2019t make intricate meals. We eat a variety of things, most of it fresh, it\u2019s just not intricate meals like his friend\u2019s mom makes. It is when his friends come over, that I am ordering a pizza or serving frozen food as there\u2019s a lot of them, it\u2019s cheaper and easier.", "created_utc": 1682922800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134eq2c/aita_for_comparing_my_son_to_his_friend_after_he/", "score": 1571, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Comparing kids against their friends is a shitty thing to do and it messes them up (as I know from my own experiences) but what you said seems pretty fair in the context of the exchange. It would be a different ballgame if you were comparing your kid against his friend's talents or self-expression (clothes, hair), that is never cool.\n\nBut you may have come upon a teachable moment. Assuming you aren't a hypocrite and don't set impossible standards for your kid (like you don't get mad if he gets a B on a test), you could talk about it like: \n\n\"Look, I could bake cookies but I'm tired and I want some time just to chill out. You could have gotten an A instead of a B on the algebra test if you had studied all Saturday and Sunday, but I know that school is a full time job and I don't expect you to never relax or have fun. Nobody should be driving themselves to their breaking point just to be as productive as possible, it's no way to live.\"", "NTA. Based on details provided, you are a great mom. Comparing individuals isn't ideal, and your 16-year-old son has now hopefully learned this lesson.  You rock!", "Comparing him to his friend in relation to academic performance would be mean (e.g. \"Sam did much better than you in the last history test\"). But for his bad attitude to you? NTA.\n\nfor what it's worth I don't think Leo is an a-hole either, just a teenage boy and often they suck. You sound like you're doing a great job with him.", "NTA but kids this age compare themselves a lot to their peers. That's just how teenage is. He was comparing the food at Linda's place to his own and wished for more homecooked food to show off to his friends that his mom is also cool like Sam's mom.\n\nHe's not old enough to weigh he pros and cons and to be happy with how good he already has it. You, on the other hand, are a mature adult person who knows they have a temperamental teenager. You should've used some tact to address this issue.\n\nNot calling you AH. I can understand how hard it can be being a single mother. But the responsibility falls on you to address such problems in a healthy way. That being said, you need to teach your son to be a little grateful. He's clearly acting a little entitled.\n\nEdit: Edited a spelling error", "NTA, you sound great and 16 is a good age to be cooking, for friends, even for his mum.", "NTA.  You showed your son how it felt to be compared against someone, he didn't like it.  When things calm down, have a talk with your son.  You sound like a good mom.", "NTA. You could have handled better, but it is built up frustration and he is 16 so ultimately not unacceptable. I am a strong advocate for not comparing children and showing your children love and affirmation. However, it is a situation where he should be able to either cook/bake himself or accept take outs. \n\nI think you should apologise to him for comparing him to Sam, tell him you love him and sit down to talk to him about. Tell him that you are often stressed and tired from work and genuinely don't enjoy cooking, especially large meals for multiple people. Linda might, but you don't. If he, with or without his friends, wish to borrow the kitchen to cook or bake together as an activity then that is OK, he should just inform you before and clean up after. I think these are viable options.", "Is this real, because when I was 16 pizza and oreos sounds awesome, we wanted as much independence from our parents as possible, not expecting beef wellington and freshly baked cookies.", "NTA. My mum is a single mum. Growing up there were things she couldn\u2019t do as it\u2019s harder being a single mum. You\u2019re doing the job of two parents. I never compared her to my friends\u2019 mothers. It\u2019s just not fair. She did her best and she is a great mother. As I\u2019m sure your are too. Leo needs to be more appreciative. Maybe sit him down and talk to him about how you feel. Rn he\u2019s sounding rather unappreciative.", "NTA and he has an age where he can cook for himself and for his friends he wants something specific.

Please, do his future girlfriend a favor and remove those ideas from his brain", "NTA\n\nInfo though - is Linda a single mum, or does she also have a partner that she can share the emotional/ mental/ physical/ financial load with that allows her the joy of being able to / not as exhausted that she can cook and bake to her sons and his friends hearts desires. \n\nThis is something that you could also point out to your son.", "NTA. Your son is old enough to understand how to respect and appreciate his mom.", "Absolutely NTA. What you said to him did not even approach the entitled, mean things he was saying to you. He needs to learn women are not just there to be his servants.", "NTA your son is being a bit of a brat. It's natural to make comparisons but if he wants cookies he should make it. He'll be 18 in two years he needs to start maturing a bit.", "NTA but definitely talk to him about this and clarify why you said that. He\u2019s 16, he\u2019s old enough to learn to bake cookies himself, more than old enough to learn that the woman of the house isn\u2019t the only one who can sort things like this. Young enough to be very and reasonably hurt by what you said - but also old enough to understand that what he said hurt you and that it\u2019s unfair.", "I get where he\u2019s coming from so I\u2019ll say YTA.", "Nta  you got your point across .", "NTA. He was comparing you to his friends mum. You did the same to make a point. He is old enough to understand that and show you respect.", "NTA - but it is probably worth a follow-up conversation or 6 with him about different life choices & different personalities. \n\nIt sounds like the whole scenario is a useful coaching moment & something for the 2 of you to chat about in a \u201cnearly two equals\u201d way - maybe take him out for whatever easy/cheap treat meal you guys do together & bring it up. \n\nHe\u2019s about the right age to move from \u201cmum tells you\u201d, to \u201cmum is interested in your emerging adult view of the world & (while demanding basic respect in both directions) would like to hear what you have to say\u201d.\n\nETA: it can also cover eg \u201cI probably got a bit too defensive because it sounded like criticism of me & the way I\u2019ve raised you. But I\u2019m actually ok with my life choices & I didn\u2019t really need to be defensive. But I was tired & people generally don\u2019t act completely perfectly when they\u2019ve had a long week. So I\u2019m happy to apologise for saying what I did with \u201csnark\u201d (although I\u2019m not really apologising for the words / the concept behind them).\u201d", "ESH- your kids love language is obv acts of service", "Soft YTA since you are the adult and could have handled it a bit better. But honestly, I feel you. Parenting is hard, you cannot be perfect in your reactions all the time.\n\nTalk to him again about how his comment made you feel, apologize for your reaction and talk it out. Could  be a very good moment for the two of you. Good luck, OP!", "Im sorry but NTA. He fucked around and found out.", "YTA. You\u2019re the parent not the child, control what you say to your children when you\u2019re offended/upset. He\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s going to say things to intentionally hurt you. Is it inappropriate and time for a lesson? Yes. Is it appropriate for you to act like a teenager back? Absolutely not. \n\nAlso would it kill you to make one thing your kid asks for for his friends? How much effort do you put into your relationship with your son? He\u2019s constantly making bids for your attention and affection by asking you these things and saying yes sometimes will probably do wonders for your relationship with him. I know you\u2019re tired and that you don\u2019t have to do it, but every once in awhile it would be nice to make some cookies to make your son feel loved and heard.", "ESH.  But you only have so much more time to polish up some of the lessons you should be imparting to him.  One of these is that not everybody lives the same way.  Another is that you shouldn't be changing who you are OR asking the people who love you to change who they are to impress a new friend.  That's what he's doing here.

I'm a single mom, so he doesn't have a two parent household like some people. We talk often about being grateful for what we \\*do\\* have and the grass always being greener.\n\nIt's not as if I've avoided these things for 16 years. It's why I'm genuinely surprised this is happening now.

If she refused, that would be the end of it.\n\nSo I can understand that he wants to have some of the nice things his friends have but his behavior and the way he puts it across is unacceptable. So I guess you need to try a different method to teach him some manners. He's growing and so is his circle. So its gonna get more difficult. You'll just have to keep a cool head about it and still get your point across. You can't go down to his level no matter how offended you are.

He fears not being good enough for this friend right now.  That's a hard thing to deal with.  Eventually, he'll learn how to relax or he'll see that a relationship should not come with so much anxiety.  He's listening to you, like he has with other things growing up.   \n\nIt's completely understandable that you lost your cool.  He was being bratty.  It happens.  \"Parents are adults\" for sure, but we're also not perfect.

Meanwhile, my parents would get home late, so if I had a friend over, it was just us and whatever lame-ass snacks I could cobble together.

You seem like a good mother, in fact, I wish my mom was sensible like you when I was a teen, especially when I was very reactionary and argumentative. My mom was similar with food except she was naturally a super good cook and loved cooking for the family. She, however, would get burnt out really easily from both unresolved mental health issues, abuse from my dad, and with me being a pretty rebellious pos trouble kid, so I would have to kind of make whatever was in the fridge work for me and the little sibling. My mom would do a very poor job respectfully communicating with me growing up and both the lack of communication and disregard for any of my opinions and views made me resent her. In fact, she STILL doesn't properly acknowledge how poorly she treated me when I was growing up with her, even when I now am rational enough to acknowledge how problematic I was. I have done things on the side to take care of myself like therapy. I have zero issues with my partner of 5 years and have a much easier time socializing normally regardless of my past trauma. I'm trying to get my mom to do the same now, but she is pretty resistant, which obviously puts a strain on our relationship.\n\nCommunication is such an important thing in any relationship that you value and it took me a while to understand this. I really hope you don't close yourself off because of how your son hurt you because while he was in the wrong in this situation, moments where you show where you make efforts to effectively and respectfully communicate when disagreements take place will leave a positive impression on him and will serve an invaluable lesson that he will appreciate tremendously when he is older.\n\nPlease have a heart to heart with him.\n\nAlso, side recommendation: Occasionally you and your son should cook really good food together. Like maybe once a week you two can make a really good recipe or something to help with two things: 1) your son appreciate the effort that is put into cooking 2) to help better set him up for being an adult 3) for doing something together as a team. While you are the \"big dawg\", you and little dawg would benefit from team building exercises as it opens up for more opportunities to communicate as one adult to another soon to be adult.

I work my butt off I hardly have energy left for myself sometimes. I wonder how parents like YOU do it.\n\nSo good for you.

Explain that the comment about Linda hurt your feelings (because whether you actively realize it or not, it sounds like it did), and that he also owes you an apology for comparing you. \n\nIt sounds like he really wants home cooked meals. Honestly, those meal kits are so helpful, and they come with recipe cards so you can make them in the future. Why not have a weekend night where you guys make the meals together? Or take the time to show him how to bake. Baking cookies isn\u2019t hard, but it does take time. Taking the time to teach him does multiple things: gives you time to bond with a teenage son who\u2019s going to be out of the house soon, teaches him a life skill to take to college, university, or a future apartment, teaches him baking cookies actually does take time and energy (so he can understand and appreciate it), and gives him context to appreciate anyone making him cookies in the future. I dated a guy for 5 years who would just demand cookies or steak but had never cooked or baked in his life. I left and 6 weeks later he apologized for the way he treated me once he had to make food for himself (straight from mom\u2019s house to my house sort of deal).

OP can only do meal boxes, and refuses to try to learn anything else.\n\nBeing tired after a long workweek sucks. I understand.

I just cannot understand OP not being able to make an attempt, ever. Like never. With 2 weeks prep? Never. With a full year prep? Never. I really do not understand that.\n\nHe's not asking for a 7-course meal. He's asking for one of the easiest possible foods that you can make, with the easiest possible cooking method (baking) that is the most forgiving and hardest to ruin. \n\nI really cannot understand \"here's some oreos\" instead of sitting down and talking to son about why it's hard to make these meals.", ">Yeah, without any notice. And she still can say yes or no to baking cookies.\n\nYou're saying that actually pizza and oreos are better and he should enjoy those, but he clearly doesn't. She can say no. She's said no every time thus far. I find it strange that OP does not want to try to find a way to make her kid happy ONE TIME, or if that is not possible to at least understand his request and what else she can do to make him happy in other ways.\n\n> I baked and cooked regularly at his age.\n\nIn my day we walked to school 1000 miles in each direction, uphill both way, with newspapers around our feet because shoes hadn't been invented in those days.\n\nYou know, OP could suggest that they bake together or if son can't bake she could offer to learn with him. That's something parents can do. \n\n>This makes no sense as the comparison, the son here didn't asked to do something together.\n\nWhich is something OP could have suggested, and probably had better results than she did here.", ">have you ever thought that maybe he's embarrassed or his friends give him a hard time because it's frozen or pizza everytime\n\nthen the **sixteen year old** can cook something else. The thing he is trying to say is that he thinks this is somehow her responsibility. It's not", "Sometimes kids need things pointed out to them.\n\nLeo is only thinking about cooking, he's not thinking about the reduced mental load Linda has because she has a husband around to help with the family and chores.\n\nWhich is why OP needs to have a genuine conversation where she points out the full picture.  If Leo continues to be unappreciative after that, okay, he's a bit of an AH, but right now he needs perspective he doesn't have, he's not an AH for not realizing the family differences.  If anything the fact that his mom being a single parent isn't something in the forefront of his mind all the time, shows what a great job OP has done being there for her son.  Many kids of single parents can't help but see all the compromises in their life pretty early, so it's part of their day to day. OP's son hasn't gotten there yet, that doesn't mean he's an AH.", "Sure, I get that. He\u2019s a teenager though and while that doesn\u2019t necessarily excuse him being an asshole to his mom, most teens tend to be self centered and selfish which explains his reaction. OP did the right thing making this a teachable moment and hopefully the kid will be more empathetic in the future because of it.", "Precisely. Teens are still kids and need guidance and to be corrected when they throw self centered tantrums like this.\n\nThat said, if OP just snaps at the kid and doesn\u2019t follow up that could quickly switch this to a Y-T-A for me.", "Comparing a single parent to a married parent is still an unfair comparison.", "Have you seen Last of Us? \"Love me the way I want you to.\"\n\n>The point is yeah Leo asked her to do something that is easy for me and sure, just one time, but it\u2019s not like his friends are suffering at his house.\n\nOP admits that EVERY SINGLE OTHER TIME she's just reheated pre-made frozen foods, and her son asked her THIS ONE TIME for cookies.\n\nThings OP could have tried:\n\n* Talk to son honestly about how tired she was, and asked for alternatives he would accept (instead of telling him oreos would suffice)\n* Ask if frozen was ok for now, but see if they could plan something home-cooked in the future\n* Offered to cook together with son to take some strain off of her\n* Asked if son could do the cooking, though she'd give money for ingredients\n* Asked if there was any special takeout she could get that would work just as well\n\nInstead, she just said \"here's some money and cookies. What do you expect from me?\"\n\nI just cannot understand how OP is shocked that her son responded in this fashion. I mean, I feel like you can give her NTA all you want but is it making her life better? Is calling her son entitled rather than having an honest conversation going to improve their relationship?", "Yikes thanks for sharing that but I wouldn\u2019t blame your friend\u2019s mom for his sexism. It\u2019s more likely that he learned it from the men around him.", "One of the reasons that kids cannot drive, vote, or other things until they reach a certain age is they don't always make good decisions.\n\nPresumably, OP, as the adult, could come up with some situations that could help her son look like a hero in a way that works with her life.\n\nOP is NTA for not making the cookies, but how does telling her she acted perfectly and she should keep acting this way achieve her stated goal - having a better relationship with her kid.\n\nKid isn't Andrew Tate here, as far as I can tell. OP could sit down with him and go through what it takes to make complicated meals. She could even work with him to make some to show how much work it is. She could suggest he learn to cook. She could ask him if he feels that, as a woman, she needs to cook for him. If so, where did he hear that?\n\nOr, you know, she could throw him a few dollars and tell him to get some oreos. Which do you think gives her a better outcome?", "Just to piggyback.  Teach him how to bake cookies or get some frozen cookie dough and let HIM bake cookies.  Putting cookie dough in the oven isn't that hard and he gets to help his hard working mom out.  So next time he asks for cookies you tell him \"Its in the freezer, have at it!\"\n\nI also suggest teaching him how to cook or at least helping you out when you are cooking.  Here's an idea....how about he makes dinner one night a week with whatever's already in the kitchen....with your guidance of course.  I can guarantee your future IL will love you for this.\n\nNTA btw.", "You are correct. The children do not ask to be born , so true, she could try. I don't think she never tries, tho. And it could be some mental health exhaustion at play, too. I know that for me, it was. However, i still think the child should be taught not to compare households. And please understand when i write it down,  i hate cooking/baking/creating food. I had to feed us, so i did. I still do ( I'm still alive daym \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude04). But the lovely times that exist now, we can also order food in. And food includes anything, and desserts,  depending on the budget \ud83d\ude01 .  I was about to forget to address your last sentence. Son is 16. You may explain it in all types,  but teenager brain will still hear \"mom is bad\" and act out. I feel that's why she reacted this way. She should still try to communicate. You feel not heard. But they do hear you. They just store these words for later and process them differently. My mom gave me this advice. Opened my eyes when i was struggling with my teenage-at-the-time daughter. \"You have raised your child with all your love. Trust that all your teachings are heard. You will see it later. She will be the way you raised her.\" I was looking at her face with my adult eyes remembering all my teenager outbursts.", "maybe the mo. should teach him to cook that's herjob as a mom t make sure he's self suffient he can't cook that's on mom", "He called her lazy \u2026 he is definitely the asshole here. He might not be AN asshole in general, he is just the asshole in this situation. Everyone is the asshole from time to time.", "An honest conversation would involve pointing out that her son is behaving in an entitled manner.\n\nTo omit that would make it a dishonest conversation.", "It is entitled, when OP explained she was tired after a long week of work (as a single parent, nonetheless), and his response is \u201cwell Sam\u2019s mom works and has no problems doing it\u201d.\n\nHow would you feel if Leo did badly at a test because he had football practice, and mom\u2019s response was \u201cwell Sam also had practice, and he got an A\u201d.\n\nAlso, per OP, Linda works part-time, has an involved partner and a house cleaner. \n\nIt sounds to me like Leo wanted to show his friends his mom also could treat them to home made stuff, but when mom offered him a different solution, which was something he did not want, he then compared her to Linda to hurt her feelings. \n\nIs that a \u201clove me the way I want you to\u201d situation?", "I don\u2019t pretend to understand you and your mom\u2019s entire relationship after this quick exchange, but moms usually love to be told that their kids have grown to appreciate their childhoods and Mother\u2019s Day is coming up :)", "Also, if given opportunity I\u2019m sure OP she would love to do all those thing Sam mom did but life isn\u2019t fair like that. It\u2019s hard being parent sometimes.", "I completely understand that comparing households is difficult, but again you were taught that. Was Leo? Another commenter said \"I baked from a young age.\" Has Loe? As a parent though, I really found I need to ask \"why are they doing that\" before I get mad.\n\nDoes the kid really feel women need to bake for him? If that's the case, that's a huge problem and it needs to be addressed. You have to talk to the kid to know.\n\nDoes the kid just want to be the hero like Sam? Maybe mom could help. Or put the kid in a better position to succeed?\n\nMaybe the kid doesn't understand the struggle mom is facing. Why not have the kid plan meals for a week and see how hard it is?\n\nI mean, none of those things are easy. But I just cannot understand how OP seems almost ready to write off the kid as an entitled asshole without even trying to understand where this is coming from.", "Telling someone \"you're an entitled asshole, let me lecture you\" is rarely a good way to get them to listen to you.\n\n>And I think at 16 it\u2019s totally fair to say \u201chey you could make the cookies\u201d. That\u2019s something my friends and I did all the time as teenagers (together as part of hanging out often).\n\nBut OP didn't say \"hey you could make the cookies.\" OP said \"here are some oreos, or go buy pre-made.\" OP didn't bother (and doesn't seem to plan to bother) to find out why Leo made these requests. She didn't bother to find out of he's jealous of Linda as a mom, or if this is a one-time thing he wants to impress his friends. She didn't ask if he's saying this because she's a woman and he expects it, or where he got that idea from? \n\nAgain, does OP want to win a NTA judgement or does OP want to understand where her son is coming from, possibly make him happy and come to some agreement where he's not constantly comparing her to Linda unfavorably?\n\nYou guys are saying that he should be really happy to have the pizza and oreos, but he isn't. So saying \"you should be happy with oreos\" isn't going to work.", ">How would you feel if Leo did badly at a test because he had football practice, and mom\u2019s response was \u201cwell Sam also had practice, and he got an A\u201d.\n\nThat's basically exactly what mom said. I would hope, if my son was disappointed in something I didn't do, I wouldn't fire back with \"well you suck too, son.\"\n\n>Is that a \u201clove me the way I want you to\u201d situation?\n\nOffering pizza and oreos and being shocked that he's not happy about it - yes.\n\n>It sounds to me like Leo wanted to show his friends his mom also could treat them to home made stuff, but when mom offered him a different solution, which was something he did not want, he then compared her to Linda to hurt her feelings.\n\nA 16-year-old boy said an assholish thing. Have you ever been 16? Again, what are OP's stated goals? If dunking on her son with an amazing comeback line like \"why do you suck so much more than Sam\" and having him not talk to her is her goal, then she's already won.\n\nDoes OP understand why son is asking this? Is he going down an Andrew Tate rabbit hole and expects women to bake for him? Is he jealous of Sam and Linda as a mom? Does he see his friends loving Linda's cookies and want to be a hero like Sam? Does he feel that mom is half-assing the food every time and wants to see if she'll make an extra effort? Does he hate her cooking, but just not want to say anything?\n\nThese are all things OP could learn, if she asked. That's all I'm saying.", "I mean\n\nI didn't read all that\n\nbut OP specifically didn't tell her son he was entitled asshole (even though he totally was, and someone should tell him) and she didn't lecture him.\n\nYou, on the other hand went off on a mahooosive rant with very little provocation. By your own logic I'm already disinclined to listen. Physician, heal thyself. \n\nSide note: I am so fucking sick of the way women in particular have to trade so carefully around the male ego in every interaction. Men can t be told anything outright by a woman, even their own mother, they have to be finessed and \"handled\" lest they bridle and and become hostile. Tone policing tells us a lot about who we think is allowed to speak and set boundaries and who isn't. \n\nFuck that. He was TA and she handled it way more politely than he deserved.", "I\u2019ve been 16, and even at 16 I knew when I was being an asshole (even though it never stopped me).\n\nWhat *did* stop me from acting like an entitled princess was my parent\u2019s reality check responses from time to time. \n\nA 16-year-old boy mad at mom for not hosting his friends with a home made meal and comparing her to another mom does feel awfully like Andrew Tate behavior.\n\nAnd no, I do not see anything wrong with how OP replied to her son\u2019s snarky comment.\n\nHe is 16, he knows better. Maybe Sam\u2019s mom is nice to him because Sam shows respect and doesn\u2019t act like an entitled little jerk when he hears the word \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nBeing a teenager is not an excuse for AH behavior.", ">A 16-year-old boy mad at mom for not hosting his friends with a home made meal and comparing her to another mom does feel awfully like Andrew Tate behavior.\n\nDo you think that's something she might be concerned about and want to get to the bottom of? OP, as stated, doesn't seem to really care.\n\n>Being a teenager is not an excuse for AH behavior.\n\nSo if your teen is an asshole, your response should be to fire back equally hard? My son can say \"I don't like you 10,000 times,\" but if I say \"I don't like you\" one time he will probably remember that for the rest of his life.\n\n>How would you feel if Leo did badly at a test because he had football practice, and mom\u2019s response was \u201cwell Sam also had practice, and he got an A\u201d.\n\nFrom a comment above. Again, this is literally what OP did with her response.\n\nAs a parent, you should always want to first ask \"why did she/he do that\" before condemning/punishing. Maybe the kid is just an asshole. Or maybe he doesn't understand how much easier Linda has it and thinks OP is lazy or doesn't care enough. Maybe he's into Andrew Tate hardcore and hates women.\n\nShouldn't OP want to find that out?", "No, comparing test scores is not the same as what OP did, as test scores would involve a lot more than just how a person chooses to behave when they hear the word \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nAlso, we aren\u2019t dealing what a toddler. This wasn\u2019t an \u201cI hate you\u201d and \u201cI hate you more\u201d situation.\n\nThe time for \u201cgentle parenting\u201d has passed. This boy needs adult interactions, and intelligent conversations. If he wants to go back to middle school insults like *\u201cbut Sam\u2019s mom can do it\u201d,* he needs a reality check. Even a 10-year-old is capable of understanding that families have different situations, and people have different talents.\n\nThis is a young man could very well be in a relationship and treating a girl like that. He needs the example of a woman that can show him that she can\u2019t be manipulated, and can\u2019t be talked down to."]}
