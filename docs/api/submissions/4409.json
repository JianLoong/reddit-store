I work hard and look after my beautiful home. We\u2019re also lucky to enjoy nice holidays. I share most of this as well as venting about say poor customer service and most of my friends expect this. I accept this isn\u2019t for everyone but they can just scroll past. \n\nThis involves my sister\u2019s SIL (her DHs sister). Let\u2019s call her Sam (45). We are linked on SM and see each other occasionally at my sisters. Sister and Sam post a bit but not much and rarely comment on my posts. Up to them. \n\nSister has 2 kids, late teens. Sam does not have kids. I heard unofficially from sis a few years ago that she\u2019d had fertility treatment which hadn\u2019t worked. We\u2019ve never spoken about it. \n\nSister\u2019s daughters ADORE Sam. She\u2019s also their Aunty. When she\u2019s there I don\u2019t get a look-in. She spoils them. I think she does it on purpose. \n\nWe were at sister\u2019s house for a pre-Christmas party. I was taking photos and eldest niece (16) wanted to vet them before I posted them. This went on a bit too long (she looked good in all of them). \nMy daughter does the same and I eventually made an executive decision to post the perfect picture anyway. Niece was upset. Sam took her side (sis was out of the room) and said it was up to niece.  I said she couldn\u2019t always get her own way, she needed to learn life was about compromise. Sam said we weren\u2019t the Kardashians ! and niece had the right of veto. \n\nCalling me Kim Kardashian felt so disrespectful and I said I was proud of family and she would understand if she\u2019d had her own kids. She flinched but didn\u2019t really respond and was icy to me all evening. My DH apologised to her on my behalf (!) which she didn\u2019t even accept,  and niece actually shouted at me. Later my sister and even BIL were angry when they found out (called me later). \n\nBut I didn\u2019t refer to her infertility and what she said was really disrespectful, as if she was better than me.

You sound insufferable.", ">she needed to learn life was about compromise\n\nFirst things first: You wanting to post pictures of someone else on social media, them not consenting to it, and then posting them anyway is not \"compromise.\" You said yourself that you made an executive decision. That is the opposite of a compromise.\n\n>Calling me Kim Kardashian felt so disrespectful and I said I was proud of family and she would understand if she\u2019d had her own kids.\n\nAnd second of all...she makes an offhanded comment about you not being the Kardashians, and you bring up her FERTILITY PROBLEMS???? Jesus Christ in heaven, I can't imagine a more disgusting, petty, and mean-spirited way to respond to that.\n\nShe didn't even call you Kim Kardashian.

There is so much wrong with this post I'm not about to begin to unwrap it, but, yes. You are very much TA.", "YTA. First of all Sam was absolutely correct. You shouldn\u2019t have posted the picture knowing your niece didn\u2019t like it. This isn\u2019t about compromise, it\u2019s about consent and you didn\u2019t have your niece\u2019s consent to post the picture. \n\nSecond, having kids has nothing to do with this. You\u2019re not your niece\u2019s mom and neither is Sam. The two of you were having this conversation as aunts. You only threw in the comment about Sam not having kids to shut her up. \n\nFinally, you know that Sam wanted kids and was unable to have them so for you to use the fact that she\u2019s childless to win an argument was just wrong.", "YTA. You posted a picture of someone else when they explicitly told you NOT to and then attacked someone\u2019s medical condition when they advocated for your niece. \n\nAlso it is absolutely not your right to share photos of others without their consent. You should look up how many of the OG influencer parents are being sued by their adult kids for exploitation and other things now. Sounds like something you might need to be educated on for your future lawsuit, just saying.", "YTA.\n\n1. You posted a picture of someone without their consent. That's illegal in my country, possibly yours, and is an AH thing to do in all countries.\n\n2. When called out on it you then use her personal struggles to hurt her. Even if you hadn't acted like an AH to her niece already you still would be a total AH just for saying that to her. She simply told you to respect boundaries, while you on purpose hurt her as much as you could. That's two completely different things.\n\nI mean this whole post makes you seem like such a garbage sort of human I even struggle to believe this is real. It's as if a stereotype of a entitled, self centered human wrote this.", "YTA 100%\n\n>I eventually made an executive decision to post the perfect picture anyway.\n\nYou don't get to just post other people on social media without their permission \n\n>But I didn\u2019t refer to her infertility and what she said was really disrespectful,\n\nShe didn't call you Kim Kardashian, she said the family wasnt the Kardashians, get the fuck over yourself. You inadvertently DID refer to her infertility by using her lack of children as a point. \n\nYou are such an asshole and sound remarkably self absorbed.", "YTA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I eventually made an executive decision to post the perfect picture anyway. Niece was upset. Sam took her side (sis was out of the room) and said it was up to niece.\n\nIt *was* up to the niece; you don't post pictures of people without their consent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Sam said we weren\u2019t the Kardashians ! and niece had the right of veto \u2026 Calling me Kim Kardashian felt so disrespectful\n\nHow did you interpret \"we weren\u2019t the Kardashians\" as her \"calling you Kim Kardashian\"?!

I expect he gets a lot of practice with that?", "YTA. Your niece didn't want a certain picture posted and you told her you were going to post it anyhow. That's not okay. \n\nThen you insulted Sam's infertility - a medical condition which she has no control over of. That was so low and cruel.\n\nYour actions were far more disrespectful than Sam's at every single step.\n\nYTA", "YTA - you sound obnoxious and cruel. The only reason it felt disrespectful is because it\u2019s true.", "YTA. For so many reasons. \n\nYou accuse Sam of spoiling her nieces 'on purpose'? Do you honestly believe she is showering them with affection solely to get one up on you?? \n\nYou comment on her lack of children, knowing full well she struggled with infertility... Then you claim you weren't actually commenting on her infertility...\n\nYou are shocked that an apology for your husband wasn't good enough... Would you ever accept an apology from a third party? \n\nIt's disappointing that you lashed out in such a hurtful way to someone, and used their pain against them.", "YTA.

If you gave your niece the option to choose which photos to be posted and then went \"nevermind I'm taking your choice away\" that's a shitty thing to do and you were right to be called out on it.

You know she's so unlikely at this point to have children and that she desperately wanted at least one child.\n\nBeing called \"Kim Kardashian\" and having her say a child should have veto power over the posting of a photo or something is so irrelevant.  Calling attention to someone not having kids who desperately wants kids is a HUGE A-hole move.  You KNEW she had fertility treatments and wanted children.  This was your retaliation to being challenged, and it came across as harsh.", "YTA. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse. The fact that you think you can post pictures of other people (especially teenagers) without their permission, and this is some sort of learning moment? BS. \n\nOr that that you would fling that back-handed comment at Sam knowing her situation. That was mean, and it\u2019s obvious you are jealous of her, so I don\u2019t doubt you did it on purpose. \n\nAnd the best part, your anger over being compared to the Kardashians when you clearly share a lot of their values is priceless.", "YTA \n\nYou should be the one apologizing to your niece and Sam. Sam is not wrong in taking your nieces side. \nYou didn\u2019t even state that she directly called you Kim Kardashian she said your family is not the Kardashians it\u2019s not critical to post the picture and make your niece upset.\n\nJust because you were told  NO got some pushback on your \u201c executive decision \u201c that would clearly make your niece upset you decided to say some evil shit\u2026.\nsomething that you weren\u2019t even supposed to know about casually\u2026\nNow you want to know if you\u2019re the asshole \u2026..? girl bye", "YTA\n\nFirst things first, your niece has autonomy on whether or not she wants to be on ANY social of  yours.  There are some occasions I take the perfect pic of my kid, but my kid asks me not to post it, so I don't.  One of my nieces HATES  pics on social media, so I DON'T post her on it EVER.\n\nSecond,  you never comment on anyone's fertility or choice to not have kids in retaliation for anything.  I was Sam for 11 years before I had my kid, but also super close to my now oldest niblings.  That's an AH  move, and if this post is any indication, your niece gravitates to Sam because she's more respectful of her autonomy.", "You're the asshole twice over.

Also, posting pictures of someone over their objections is an asshole move, no if, and or but, it's inappropriate. YTA.", "YTA. Your niece doesn't need to compromise about what photos of herself are posted. You sound selfish and entitled. Your attitude is disgusting.", "YTA. The fact that you feel a weird need to put your entire life on social media does not mean you get to put other people's lives on it.", "YTA - you know you are", "Yes, YTA. Let me count the ways.\n\nFirst, you have no right to post photos of other people\u2014let alone minors\u2014on the internet without their consent. This is not a subject for legitimate debate. You were flat out wrong.\n\nSecond, the comment about you being a Kardashian was a slap on the wrist.

So there's that.", "YTA\nI\u2019ve made a comment like this before to a friend who was judging me about my divorce.. I told her you have no right to judge since you\u2019ve never even been in a serious relationship.\nIt ruined our friendship and I didn\u2019t understand until later now when I am single for quite some time how hurtful that comment actually was.\n\nThere are levels of pain that are deeper and harder to understand just like you feel she doesn\u2019t understand your parenting decision since she doesn\u2019t have kids.\n\nHer saying you aren\u2019t a Kardashian probably hurt you because on some level you feel insecure about your social media posting.\n\nBut you saying she doesn\u2019t understand because she doesn\u2019t have kids hits a nerve deeper than you are I can understand. \nWhat I don\u2019t think you realize is you are \u201cpunching down\u201d here.\n\nYou have the very thing she wants and you are pointing that out to her because you felt slighted.\n\nI hope this is helpful.

Apologize to both and learn when someone says no to accept it.

If a child doesn\u2019t want their picture on social media take one without them to post. That\u2019s an insanely low blow to comment on somebody\u2019s infertility. There\u2019s not really ever a justifiable reason to say something like that to someone OP.", "Wow, YTA. How dare you say that. That's so disgusting.

Like, SUPERNOVA level YTA. \n\nThe picture in question was of your niece so it\u2019s absurd to even say \u201cif you had children you\u2019d understand\u201d because both of you have the same relation to her. \n\nYour SM is not of utmost importance to anyone but uou. Your niece said no. End of. It was wrong, selfish, entitled and narcissistic of you to overrule your niece\u2019s decision.

I think she does it on purpose. \n\nWe were at sister\u2019s house for a pre-Christmas party. I was taking photos and eldest niece (16) wanted to vet them before I posted them. This went on a bit too long (she looked good in all of them). \nMy daughter does the same and I eventually made an executive decision to post the perfect picture anyway. Niece was upset. Sam took her side (sis was out of the room) and said it was up to niece.  I said she couldn\u2019t always get her own way, she needed to learn life was about compromise. Sam said we weren\u2019t the Kardashians ! and niece had the right of veto. \n\nCalling me Kim Kardashian felt so disrespectful and I said I was proud of family and she would understand if she\u2019d had her own kids. She flinched but didn\u2019t really respond and was icy to me all evening. My DH apologised to her on my behalf (!) which she didn\u2019t even accept,  and niece actually shouted at me. Later my sister and even BIL were angry when they found out (called me later). \n\nBut I didn\u2019t refer to her infertility and what she said was really disrespectful, as if she was better than me. Am I really the AH here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
