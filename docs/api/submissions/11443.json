Simon has some very strange and entitled expectations of friendship. Your character predates him and has nothing to do with him.

Good riddance.", "I'm going to go with NAH.\n\nThis isn't just a case of him having the same name as a character, that's going to happen all the time (especially with a name like Simon, it's common enough to pop up sometimes in media). It's also a case of you specifically making the character, and him not really being into the roleplaying scene.\n\nI play D&D. I know that I am not my character, and other players are not their characters. An IC/OOC divide is a vital part of gaming. But for people who don't game, that concept can be a little difficult to understand. It's likely that he sees you using 'his' name and assumes you made your character to specifically be him, because why else would you give a character a name of someone you know?\n\nThe reason why I say NAH instead of N.T.A is that outside of gaming, if someone does what you're doing it's generally not for good reasons. Bullying and harassment come to mind. So I can't blame him for assuming that when he doesn't know what gaming is like.\n\nIn the end, it's probably best to let the friendship go.
