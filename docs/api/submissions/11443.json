Simon says it's time to find a friend who lacks the object permanence to realize other people can have the same name.", "NTA - He's over-reacting & doesn't \"own\" a name. If it were me I'd be pretty chuffed & find it to be a funny coincidence", "NTA. Does he also complains to other actual people who have his same name?", "NTA \n\nIt's a game and you've used that name before you even knew him. He will get over it.", "NTA you arent using his name, it would be different if you knew him when you made your character. He just happens to have the same name as the char.", "NTA. Is it so a special name that only he has it? It is childish of him to think he has the sole right of a name. \n\nHave you told him, that you have the character longer than you know him? I get why you could freak out, if someone name a character after you. But if they have the same name coincidentaly, there is no need to think about it twice. It's like when a book or movie character has the same name like you - you find it cool or creepy as achild but grow out of it when you turn about ten years old?", "NTA. It would be completely different if you started using the name **after** you had met your friend.", "Am I the only one wondering what the name is\u2026???", "NTA. That\u2019s \u201cyour name\u201d in the game so why would you change it? There are a lot of people on earth with the same name", "NTA\n\nYou made the character before you met the guy, if you made the character after meeting him then I could understand.", "NTA, does he also overreact when he meets other people with the same name? Does he refuse to watch shows or play games that have characters with the same name? If the answer is yes to either of these questions, then he probably needs professional help, he probably needs it anyway over that 'playing with him' comment.\n\nAlso, you wouldn't be the one throwing away a relationship over a name, that would be HIS decision. Personally, I think it's more selfish to claim all rights to a name, and then end a friendship when you don't get your way, but maybe that's just me.", "NTA, losing a friendship over something like this means the friendship wouldn't last anyway because it was too fragile..People come and people go, not everyone will like you..", "Tell him to stop using your character's name.

You named the character long before meeting him. Weird to try controlling you and use of his name. I mean, Rumplestiltskin is an uncommon name but he's gotta realize everyone's familiar with the story.", "NTA \n\nLOL \"his friendship\" was not worth your time if hes so entitled as to think he Owns the name Simon and can dictate who and what is called Simon. \n\nI mean. Maybe you could have explained it better idk exactly how that interaction went down, but overall from what you have said here: Good riddance.", "NAH\n\nYour character predates your friendship with this person. It sounds like they're making a strange connection between them and your character. If you had a pet named Max and later befriended someone named Max, would you have to change your pet's name to something different?\n\nIt sounds like your (ex?) friend has some deeper stuff going on. They're not an asshole for being weirded out, even if their reaction is a little strange, but it sounds like this might just be one of those deal-breakers for your friendship.\n\nTl;dr: I don't think you're being selfish, but it's also okay for your friend to be weirded out and not want to hang with you anymore.", "NAH.
