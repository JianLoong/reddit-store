Is it so a special name that only he has it? It is childish of him to think he has the sole right of a name. \n\nHave you told him, that you have the character longer than you know him? I get why you could freak out, if someone name a character after you. But if they have the same name coincidentaly, there is no need to think about it twice.

If the answer is yes to either of these questions, then he probably needs professional help, he probably needs it anyway over that 'playing with him' comment.\n\nAlso, you wouldn't be the one throwing away a relationship over a name, that would be HIS decision.

This name has a meaning to you, and a value. Plus, it is part of your relationships to other people, other players, from my understanding. Those are also valid relationships, and if your game involves a somewhat bigger community, a name change might complicate your interactions there.\n\nThat's really weird of your \"friend\" to expect. Please don't let him (and yourself) devalue something that's meaningful to you!", "It doesn't reflect well on him that he believes your coincidental use of the same name reflects on him when no one else in the game even knows of his existence.  You aren't affecting his reputation in the slightest (or the reputation of the boatload of other Simons in the world).\n\nHis demand is unfounded and unreasonable, and if you were to remain friends with him, it might not be the last. He was also rude afterwards.\n\nIt's a glimpse of colors you don't want to see in a new friendship and you should consider your parting ways a positive thing."]}
