Although the area is safe I do not like walking alone at night. The day after this the same thing happened again where she didn't come until 7:00 p.m. and when I ask her If she could give me a ride to where I lived she said she wouldn't be driving in that direction and left. \n\nFast forward to two days after that and I was left standing there until around 7:30 this time. I was extremely tired and hungry and I repeatedly tried to call the mother but she didn't respond. This time her child needed to use the bathroom and I had no choice but to take them to the back of the school, which was inconvenient and unsanitary.

Where I live after 8:00 p.m. even in the commercial area taxis generally stop running so I had no choice but to take her kid to the police station that was about 5 minutes away. I left her a voicemail explaining that her child was waiting for her there and went home.\n\n The next day when I went back to the daycare she was there and extremely angry and was demanding that I be fired for leaving her child at the police station. She said I made her worry and he didn't know where her child was, it was only when she went to the police to make a report that you found out her child was there. I tried to explain that I left a voicemail but she was unwilling to listen to my side of the story.\n\n As for the daycare/school, they have a policy that no one is allowed to take a child off the property without permission of their parents so there was a meeting to discuss what would happen.

I have noticed a lot of parents look at daycare teachers as servants. It\u2019s gross and sad. You have a family too!! I\u2019m surprised the center isn\u2019t standing by you in this. You were held liable for that child and the center after close for hours. No job is worth you potentially being held legally liable for anything that happened to the center or that child after closing time/the end of your shift.  That\u2019s not your responsibility. The only other thing I can think of that might have been an option and moving forward if this happens again- is next time maybe try calling the police to the center instead of taking the child yourself. That way you can say the police made a lawful choice you had to agree with if they were to take the child into their custody till the parent could be contacted. You did what you could. You were really put in between a rock and hard place. I\u2019m so sorry. That center should have policies in place to prevent these type of situations from occurring frequently or rarely at all. Typically, an emergency contact plan. Being late to pick up your child a few times, fine. All parents have crazy schedules - I get it! But to this extent? I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s time for the center to remove this family from the center\u2019s care. What\u2019s even worse is that this child will always remember their mom doing this and wondering why. she will have to answer to that when the child becomes older, which is just a shame. I would also recommend keeping a log of how often this mother is late and by how much time she is late as well for your job security.

Obviously.\n\nBut I'm having a very hard time believing this story is true, OP, for the following reasons:\n\n* No daycare I've ever heard of would be so cavalier in letting parents arrive whatever time they damn well please to pick up their kids. All the ones I've heard of start charging parents in 10 or 15 minute increments if they're late! e.g. $20 if you're 10 minutes late, $50 if you're 20 minutes late, $100 if you're 30 minutes late, and so on. The cost rises exponentially the later you are. It's to teach parents to *pick up their kids on time*, or pay for it.\n* No daycare I've ever heard of would lock an employee out of the building if they were left with a child who hadn't been picked up yet.\n* No daycare I've ever heard of would consider it reasonable for an employee to wait around for THREE HOURS after closing time because a parent had failed to collect their child.\n* No daycare I've ever heard of would fail to support the employee if the employee did the only reasonable thing under the circumstances, namely, dropping the child at the police station. The idea that the daycare center is blaming *you* for this, and is considering forcing you to go on leave, is outrageous.\n\nYou say it's not located in America. I don't live in America either.\n\nWhat the hell kind of daycare is this?", "NTA and you really should consider to change employer if they don't back you up with what you did.", "INFO: why is it always you that gets stuck waiting with this child? Why is no one else (preferably with a car) doing this?", "NTA and then your boss etc suck. When I used to work at a preschool we also had that. We were open till 5 and a parent kept coming late. So the boss talked to them and put their foot down. That's what your boss should do. Also, do you get paid for the extra hours? Did you talk to your boss before? The only thing I would have done if I were you to talk to my boss before and also to call them before bringing the kid to the police.", "NTA, the parents are arseholes.\n\nThey should never have left you in that position.  Being half an hour late once or twice perhaps... Life, traffic etc might cause this but to be consistently late and for it to be 3 hours after expected pick up is total bullshit.\n\nTaking the child to the police station seems like the only reasonable thing to have been done.\n\nIf the nursery had any backbone at all they would side with you and either ban them from the school or charge them double time after 5, until they get the picture that it's not ok to be so late to pick up their child.", "NTA. If you're not allowed to take the kid away from the property call the police to come and pick up the abandoned child if the parent is late and not answering her phone. Also, your boss sucks if you get into trouble for this, it's the parent who's an AH. Why her kid still has a place in the daycare if she constantly disrespects the hours the daycare is provided?", "So someone locks up the day care and leaves you sitting outside with a kid? Why don\u2019t they leave you the key to lock up or they stay? I get that the daycare is closed and that mom is a jerk, but there could be a legitimate reason/emergency one day, there needs to be a better plan for a late kid than sitting outside.

My cousin owns a nursery. Most places have a 10 minute grace period from closing time. They then can charge \u00a330-\u00a350 if parents do not collect their child within the next 30 minutes. After that time, legally they are supposed to take the child to a police station as the child is deemed as being abandoned. Also two members of staff have to stay with the child INSIDE the building.

You need an explanation for this, not just so a solution can be found (although this sounds like it might be a bigger issue than some planning can hash out) but also for the kid\u2019s safety. \n\n2) her phone was off/she was not picking up the phone. There are places with bad reception and there are places where they don\u2019t want you to be on your phone, but that\u2019s something parents usually mention or make note of on their contact forms. \n\n3) why are you the only one staying with the kid? Especially with your transportation situation. The preschool that was connected to my elementary school had the adults rotate, yes there were times where the same person closed a few days in a row but this sounds like more than a few days problem. \n\n4) why is there no policy for children suspected of being abandoned/when you can\u2019t contact a guardian? You are a child care facility, there are people who have abandoned their kids by just dropping them off at daycare and never coming back, the parents can get into accidents and are unable to pick up the kid (although you\u2019d hope if that were the case they\u2019d call)\n\n5) why is there no policy for excessive late pickups? You already have a 30min window and she still gets there any where from 30min- 1hr + after that, that\u2019s not a good sign. \n\n6) is there no one else to pick up this kid?\n\n7) the current execution of that policy (no one can remove a child from the property without parents permission) in this situation is stupid and honestly a bit suspicious. They removed you and the kid from the property when they locked up the building with the two of you outside. They left you the sole guardian of that child, with no access to shelter or bathroom facilities. (Honestly I would\u2019ve started making a fuss after having to piss in a bush)\n\n8) you left the kid with the cops, did they open a child services ticket on the kid? Did they try contacting the mother? \n\n9) when did she make it to the station?\n\n10) why has no one tried to come up with a sustainable solution before this point, again, this is well known and repeated behavior, the fact that no one has tried anything to correct it is honestly concerning. And makes me wonder about the credentials, legality, and overall safety of this facility. \n\nNote: I am an American, and working under that lens.

The daycare dropped the ball here. OP was doing her job and not being paid. The daycare should have been putting financial pressure/fees in the mother for showing up 1 to 3 hours late.
