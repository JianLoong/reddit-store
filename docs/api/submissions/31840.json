First I would agree with your mom, you're not the one paying for the tickets home and most of the people I know who go to other countries to visit relatives are there for a minimum of a month because of how expensive it is. I would say talk to your parents first about ticket prices to see how expensive they are with your travel habits. Secondly how long have you been dating this guy? If it's been less then two years then he has no standing on whose family you visit for the holidays since you see yours once a year. If you guys have been dating longer then maybe a compromise of him tagging along for some of the holiday to meet your family and friends would help him with his loneliness. Now for the giant red flag, the immigrants don't go home bull. That's a lie and was used to make you feel guilty about leaving him. Immigrants go home all the time and just because they immerse themselves in their new country doesn't mean they're gonna completely abandon their family in their home country.

Your boyfriend sounds like a selfish whiny asshole. How dare he say that you're not committed to living in the UK if you want to go home ONCE a year? I mean it's ONCE a year it's not multiple times a year! So you have a pet and that pet might need to go into a kennel for a couple of weeks, so what? There are people that travel a lot and their pets are either taken care of by a trusted friend or they're put into a kennel so that they're taking care of adequately while they're away.

For him to not only renege on his promise to take care of your pet, for him to accuse you of not being committed to living in the country that you MOVED to (what he's really saying is that you're not committed enough to HIM because you refuse to neglect your family) only demonstrates his level of immaturity!", "NTA. Once a year isn't that often. Lots of people I know do try and get home at least yearly if they can afford it. Hell, I live in the UK and only usually made it home about once a year maybe twice because I chose to go to uni 10 hours away from my parents and it wasn't a convenient place to make flights worthwhile etc etc and I ended up with a weekend job that became a summer job.

Of course you should study the place, try to talk to some people that have used their services to be certain they will be well taken care of, one thing that is important is if they need you to provide their vaccine reports and stuff like this (I don't really know what's necessary for your pets) for you to also be sure that the other pets present will be healthy too. Honestly feels like they would be much more safe in a facility then with your boyfriend. I think he's been totally unreasonable about this. Even if he actually thinks like this and is not just saying these things to convince you to stay, he should understand that to you is important to be with your family, which is absolutely understandable. Also, giving up an entire week with your family, who you'll see again only in a year, to be with him, who you'll be able to be with a lot more often, shows you are committed to meeting him halfway, the least he could do is the same for you.

Your SO probably isn't magically going to adopt your family, culture and way of life, and if he/she does, at some point he/she may feel he/she is losing his or her identity. First generation immigrants are often caught between two worlds, and may feel even further lost and isolated when their children grow up as natives of their new home.

If you want to spend the last week with your boyfriend that is OK but what is not OK is excepting pressure from either side. Your mother is being inconsiderate by one and you did the whole three weeks irrespective of your life in the UK.

I can understand feeling bummed out.\n\nThe rest, though? Nah. And frankly, I find his comments about you \"needing to assimilate\" as an immigrant really gross and xenophobic. Lots of immigrants go back to their country of origin once a year or more. I used to go visit my parents across the ocean for Christmas and the summer (these days, they come visit me, as they're retired and I have young children). Assimilating doesn't mean forgetting where you come from, or not seeing your family for years.\n\nIdk, I'm not very impressed with this dude.", "NTA, very obviously. I don't get the \"massive red flags, break up with him weeks ago\" vibes others are claiming. He isn't being straightforward and fair in this discussion, so has taken a manipulative turn with calling you \"irresponsible\" and trying to build an argument for that claim. It's wrong, but if he can see that he is wrong and apologize, then it's something that can be worked through.\n\nI believe the truth is that it's really hard for him to have you gone for three weeks, especially over the Christmas holidays. It is genuinely harder for an adult with little family: many things are closed, there is an expectation and memories of family togetherness that you aren't a part of, and even if you hated family holidays, it can all feel very empty.\n\nI suggest gently reinforceing that you will be gone for three weeks. You understand that these trips are difficult for him and would be willing to brainstorm ways to make it easier while you are gone. But also make it clear that it is not \"irresponsible\" of you to fulfill a family obligation of visiting them for 3weeks a year, and that you can arrange for your pets care if he wants the freedom to travel or do something else, though you appreciate any time he does choose to care for them at home. It is not okay to insult you because he is lonely while you are gone and wants you to make a different choice. I would also let him know that unless he his comfortable being thought of as a rather racist, anti-immigrant Conservative that he should never use try to manipulate someone with the \"you would better integrate into UK society if you...\" ever again, and to not use it with you in any case. He is hopefully just clueless, but statements like that have an awful history.", "NTA your going to visit yourfamily for the holidays like millions of people do.

NTA", "NTA but he really is! I have a lot of issues with his points of view. Going home to spend Christmas time with your friends and family once a year is absolutely more than reasonable and he's a jerk for having a problem with it and giving you a hard time! He might miss you, which would be natural, but he should wish you well and be happy that you are getting to see your family and friends and spend time with them. The fact that he's not, that's very telling. Plane tickets aren't cheap, and you're only going once a year, so it very much makes sense to go for three weeks instead of two, to maximize the money being spent on the tickets and also because again, you're only going once a year so it gives you time to spend with everybody there before leaving. You said he does not have many friends or family, I don't know whether that means he literally has no one to spend Christmas with? But not for nothing, it's not your responsibility to figure that out for him. What did he do every year until he met you at Christmas time?? And why is he so focused on you integrating into the uk? Have you decided for sure that you are definitely staying there after you finish university? Please don't make that decision based just on him. You need to decide for yourself what you want to do and where you want to live. And that does not need to be a permanent decision. Integrating into another country's culture and community does not mean you need to abandon your other one. Those two things can coexist. He is acting like a spoiled brat and he sounds controlling. If I were you, I would place very firm boundaries. It's okay to tell him no, and it's okay if you don't do what he wants you to do. As far as watching your rodents while you were gone, he had already agreed to do it. It's only once a year. If he decides to go back on his word now, he will be doing it just to be revengeful because he doesn't like the fact that you're going and not doing what he's telling you to do and following his demands instead. I think there are some big red flags here, but the good news is that you're not married to him so you're not tied down to him. Please don't sacrifice what you want to do because he doesn't like or agree with it. Please think very carefully before getting more seriously involved with him.", "NTA, he shouldn\u2019t depend on you so much that he doesn\u2019t want you leaving for 3 weeks?

As long as you aren't disruptive to your neighbors and other UK residents, it doesn't matter how British you feel or act, as long as you're happy...

Especially if he doesn't have any family or friends to spend it with other than you and the pet rodents that he will be taking care of for you. That would absolutely test my commitment to the relationship and send any insecurities i have about the relationship through the roof.  \nHe is upset and lashing out at you in frustration and hurt. He is obviously being an asshole in how he is lashing out at you and how he is doing it, but he has completely valid feelings of abandonment about this whole situation. It is understandable that he is feeling hurt or betrayed here, and people say stupid shit when they are hurting.\n\nIt doesn't help that on top of that you had made an agreement with him that you would spend the last week of vacation with him, presumably meaning Christmas eve, He had agreed to the compromise so that you got to see your mom, and he got to spend Christmas with his partner. Then you reneged on it because mommy dearest didn't think two weeks with you was a good enough return on investment. That must have been a real punch to the gut.\n\nShe is not respecting that you have social obligations in the UK too now. would it not be possible to do it every second year, maybe then both of you travel to your mom instead? \n\nHe has completely legitimate grounds for being upset and frustrated here when his girlfriend consistently choses her mom over him every single Christmas. I can't imagine you would have been fine with him **choosing** to leave you alone for weeks at a time around your birthday, every single birthday.", "He is not a boyfriend. He is a place holder.  He is expected to spend the next 4 Christmas and New Years  without a Girlfriend until she graduates and goes back home.", "I wouldn\u2019t want my partner disappearing EVERY XMAS", "Why not consider his feelings though?  That he wants to enjoy the season with you or that he'll be alone for the holidays? ..because you want to play sports?  That can't be right.  YTA.  I try to make sure not one of my loved ones are alone for the holidays. If my aunt 1,000 miles away was going to be alone I'd go there or invite her here.  Why not invite him?\n\nI think everyone is saying not the ahole because you've left it open for everyone to assume he's racist and they're triggered.", "Neither are the a*hole. It's not about you going home, it's about him wanting to spent time with you. I have a similar situation. Met my GF in Germany while she was an Expat, now I'm an Expat in her home country.\n\nFirst, I was not happy with her wanting to go back every year, now she's not happy with me wanting to go back every year.\nIt's the perks of being an international couple. \n\nHe's a young guy and obviously not great in expressing his needs, he might not even be fully aware of them himselves. \"Irresponsible\" is something that maybe only would be applicable to your pets and that became the center of the argument. Without knowing the details, he might have a point in that case that he's tied to where you guys live because he's taking care of the pets, so he can't even take the same time off and go to family etc. Anyway, find a compromise going forward. Maybe every other year celebrate Christmas back home, while the other year you go home for a different holiday or during summer break. \n\nHow some people here directly jump to \"controlling vibes\" \"major red flag\" etc etc is not understandable for me.", "Neither is TA.\nYou've both got fair points. \n\nA fair compromise might be every second year but for longer? Or could he be invited? \n\nAs your partner, I think it's fair of them to expect to have you dedicate some time to them over xmas.

Probably with narcissistic traits. I\u2019m surprised that you have not noticed it by now with other conflict that you both have on other issues. I hope that you are brave enough to leave this relationship. All of the therapy in the world will not fix this person or this relationship. Protect yourself.", "NTA\n\nConsidering \"irresponsible\" is the word he chose, seems his only real qualm/point is that he has to watch your pets. Which, he did agree to at one point, but it's reasonable to later find what that entails or the potential time frame and decide to back out, though this should be communicated as early as possible.\n\nIf yall came to the compromise of making it 2 weeks instead of 3, and he's good with watching them for that long, and your mother's only issue with that is the price of airfare/days home ratio, maybe see if he's willing to chip in on the ticket cost so she'll feel a bit better about it? Obviously i don't know what the tickets cost or yalls personal financial situations, but if yall could absorb some of that cost it could be a good solution for all.", "I\u2019m sorry but what kind if needy child is your boyfriend?

And she is doing it because she feels December is more comfortable and convenient for her, not because it is the only time she can visit her mom.\n\nOn top of that he already compromised and was OK with her being there two weeks, then presumably spending Christmas eve with her boyfriend.
