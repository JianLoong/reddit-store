Similarly, his talk of \"integration\" is equally silly. Are British people who go on holiday at Christmas second class citizens as a result?\n\nIf it doesn't work out with your boyfriend, pick one with a better vocabulary next time.", "NTA...his behaviour is controlling. The part about having to become more British is just a gross way of trying to manipulate you into staying for him.", "NTA. He is trying to control you. \n\n>2. i should try to integrate into the u.k. and make an effort to \u201cbecome more british\u201d,\n\nTotal BS, IMHO. If you are comfortable studying at the university, you are integrated. You should not become British, you should be yourself.", "Speaking as a Brit, this boy is a knob. Go and enjoy your Christmas, hug your family, play sports and have fun. Your pets will be fine. You are not responsible for the happiness of another adult. You can integrate into being British, or choose never to, in your own way. We have room for all sorts in our funny little island, make your own path. Have a lovely holiday.", "There are many issues to unpack.  the first and foremost being is that you are NPOT married , nor do you talk about what YOU want for your future.\n\nThis is about what YOU want, not what your BF wants.\n\nYour family is paying for the trips.  So you are not being financially irresponsible.  Your family will only see you once a year, during this break. You sound young (late teens, early 20's) and are starting the adult life that wyou have int he future.  it is natural to want to spend time with your family.\n\nDo you plan on emigrating to the UK?  You don't mention it.  Maybe you haven't really thought about.  Lots of people return to their home country after finishing their education.\n\nThe pet thing is a non starter.  you mention a pet boarding facility.\n\nYour BF seems to want to dictate or control you, what activities you will do.  That is the major red flag.  \n\nIt is not up to YOU to spend time over the holidays with him, solely because he has a small social circle.  That is ON him.\n\nNTA for traveling home to see your family over the holidays.", "NTA - sounds like your boyfriend is being kind of xenophobic along with him trying to control you.

You haven't made a serious commitment to him. Your primary allegiance is still with your birth family, not this cute dude.\n\nI love the way that this 20 year old, with all that experience, thinks he knows what \"Immigrants who are properly committed\" do with their holidays. Arrogant of him, even considering that he's at an arrogant stage of life. \n\nYour pet care is the only thing that he's right about. When you get pets you have to provide for their care when you aren't there.\n\nNTA - Visit your parents when you want to. Use your holidays the way that you want to. You are a young, single woman and should explore that to the extent you want to before making commitments that tie you down (e.g. pets that are more complicated than rodents).", "NTA - bf is high demand. If you want to go home for three weeks out of 52 then go. He can survive as he gets to see you for 49 weeks and your friends and family for three. If he\u2019s not happy I suggest you look for a new bf. It is not irresponsible to visit family and friends for three weeks each year. He is gaslighting you. Really consider whether this sniveller is the person you want to be with long term.", "NTA What did I just read? Become more british? WTF is that supposed to mean? I live in uk and go to see my family as often as I can. My british partner would never say anything like that to me. Last 2 times he stayed home with our pets when I went to see my family. \n\n *I am not integrating into the u.k. if i have the desire to go back to my home country once a year*\n\nI hope you laughed in his face when he said that.", "NTA your BF is trying to manipulate and isolate you from your family and home country. You\u2019re not irresponsible nothing you\u2019re doing adds up to being irresponsible at all!", "NTA. BF sounds insecure and like he wants you to be lonely with him.\n\nDaughter of an immigrant - my dad was not made more British by sitting around eating turkey while it rained outside.\n\nHolidays are a time for family and rest. How is replacing your family obligations with boyfriend obligations a trade up?", "NTA  your bf is trying to control and gaslight you. Leave him immediately.", "NTA totally. I still go home for Christmas after 9 years in UK and all my British patients and friends found it really strange that I was thinking of NOT going this year (takes me forever travelling with trains with my dog). My ex who I dated in uni just accepted that I would not be here over Christmas and summer holidays and that what it was for dating someone who is not from UK. If he is so unhappy about your pets maybe look if you have another friend that could look after them while you are away if he doesn\u2019t want to care for them.", "NTA at all, you aren't being irresponsible at all.\n\nCan he come with you?  How long have you been together?", "NTA dump the boyfriend, too many red flags girl", "NTA. As others have pointed out, red flags are in abundance here, like you could make bunting from how many there are.\n\nYou are not an asshole for going home for your Xmas break nor are you an asshole for putting your pets in boarding, if he chooses to go back on his word to care for them.", "Nta your bf is only thinking about himself and his \"reasons\" are unreasonable. Your family are also your loved ones and it's not your responsibility if he doesn't have many friends (his neediness may explain that. )", "Wow! He is so racist! He has no idea of what he is talking. Of course immigrants want to go back to their home countries to visit, however many can\u2019t afford it. \n\nDo what you want to do. If you want to go, go. If you want to stay, stay. But don\u2019t let anyone manipulate you.", "NTA.\n\nHis first point actually reinforces your argument, unless he thinks you don't love your family?\nHis second point is nonsense, many British Uni students go to stay with their parents over Christmas break, to reconnect with friends and family.\nHis last point has more to do with owning pets than with visiting family.\n\nHe sounds lonely, and maybe a bit too dependent on you. Stick with your own plans, it's a bad idea to rearrange your life around a boyfriend at Uni, but maybe explore ways to help him get through the time that you're away.", "NTA. \n\nIt's nearly impossible to explain the feeling of not being able to see your family and to feel like an outsider when you're an immigrant. Going away for three weeks is not irresponsible and it won't ruin you \"integrating\" in UK. \n\nI've been in the UK for six years now and I can only go back a few times a year but I would love to go more. I don't even have the words to explain just how much your bf sucks for saying all this shit.", "Unless your home country is unsafe: NTA\n\nI can get behind his first point though and him being unhappy about beind left behind lowkey lonely during holidays for so long, I can see how this is not a nice thing from his pov. But that doesn't make you irresponsible (given the place is actually safe to go to).", "I think going home to celebrate Christmas with your family is pretty common in Britain, so I don't know what he's on about. If he had a British gf she'd probably go home to her family too.\n\nNTA He's a wanker.", "His behavior is a red flag. I'd reconsider the relationship. Please read why does he do that by Lundy. Here is a free copy https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat\n\n\nSeeing your family once a year for 3 weeks isn't irresponsible or unreasonable . If he can't live without you for 3 weeks he's got a problem he needs to work on. If I were your mom I'd be pissed if you told me you can't come for 3 weeks cause you want to hang out with your bf you see 344 days out of the year", "I\u2019d say in general NTA for the most part, but unilaterally deciding he has to stay put to care for your pet is a little unfair.
