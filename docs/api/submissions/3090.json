In my experience, alas, very few people want to be corrected and have an adverse reaction to it. Personally, I appreciate corrections. For instance, English is not my first language, and although I am now old as the hills, I would still like to improve my English. Grammar, spelling, idioms, the lot.

It puts the awkwardness back on Taz and leaves you in the clear. It let's Jenny know that while she may not always say things right, it's okay to be imperfect. Language is a form of communication, as long as everyone understands what you are saying, the rest really doesn't matter. \n\nI have a linguistics friend and she had this same issue, it's hard when you learn something like this and want to share it with those you love.

It's just a) there's a similar Arabic proverb, blood thicker than milk, meaning the opposite, and b) people got tired of blood/water being used as a \"but faaaamily\" cudgel, so the covenant/womb interpretation got invented.  \n\nOn the one hand I get where you're coming from, but linguistically speaking language is what native speakers use it as.  \"Proper\" English is a concept that has its roots in classism, racism, and educational snobbery.  Does it bug  me that \"irregardless\" is now a word? Yes, a little, but I don't correct people who use it.\n\nMy current stance is that language is about communication, and so as long as the meaning is clear, it's not worth nitpicking.  \"Could/couldn't care less\" both mean \"its unimportant\", so they're both correct.  \"I ain't got no X\" almost always means \"I don't have X\", so both are correct.  Etc.", "NTA.  The issue here is that where you to constantly correct her you might actually be in the same situation based on the feedback your friends have given you about this.  You have made a conscious effort to alter your behavior as not to upset people as you had been told it does and in doing so have upset someone else.  It sucks, but honestly that is just how it goes and you need to decide if you will end up being more upsetting to those you care about by staying quiet or always correcting them.  \n\nJust remember these quotes that seem appropriate here: \n\n\"You can please some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but you can not please all of the people all of the time\" - John Lydgate\n\n\"He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away\" - Raymond Hull", "NTA.

My dyslexia and general scattyness makes it super hard to remember terms right. Luckily I don\u2019t really care.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to quietly tell someone, rather than then continuing to embarrass themselves. \n\nThough there will be folk that, you know will take clear offence, so make a judgement call.

If Taz wanted to correct Jenny's language so badly, then they should have done it instead of pressuring you.

You\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s best to not correct people because of the history you have in doing so.  The best you can do is explain that to her, and why you didn\u2019t correct her.  I would then ask if, going forward, she would like you to correct her whenever you notice she says something wrong. \n\nIt didn\u2019t help that your other friend laughed at her mistake making her feel more embarrassed like she was supposed to know.

Correcting people\u2019s grammar/language etc is ableist & classist. It also operates under the assumption that English is the superior language everyone should know. Not everyone has the same education and if you know what someone means when they say something, it\u2019s kinda controlling to correct or shame them and makes folks feel like they can\u2019t be themselves. It can also be triggering for folks who are survivors of abuse/were criticized all the time. If you don\u2019t know what someone means, ask for clarity. Otherwise, as long as someone isn\u2019t saying something harmful, definitely NTA for not correcting them. It doesn\u2019t sound like Jenny has ever asked you to correct her in the past and it wouldn\u2019t have even caused her any insecurity if Taz hadn\u2019t brought it up/pushed it. Kinda rude on Taz\u2019s part, but I can also see them just noticing the behavioral change & thinking it was no big deal to mention lightly. I think Jenny just got anxious & in her head about looking \u201cstupid\u201d \u2014 but she isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s definitely a healthy habit to not go around correcting folks over stuff like that \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA.
