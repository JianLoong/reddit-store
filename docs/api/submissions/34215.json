If you want to see her before she passes, she's going to force you to interact with your sister. Us commenters can't know how unfair an ask that may be - curse of being vague on details - but either way it's the hand you've been dealt.   Only you get to decide which choice you can bear. Either you risk not saying your goodbyes in person to your mother, or you risk exposing yourself to a person you've cut out of your life. \n\nNone of us know which choice will make you an asshole, either to your mother or to yourself. You have to reflect on your morals, your boundaries, and your needs, and make the choice that serves all three best. There's not a right answer, just the choice you can live with. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss, and I wish you and your loved ones as peaceful a grieving process as is possible.", "Refusing to give the reasons for the estrangement makes a lot of us believe you\u2019re the asshole in this situation who\u2019s desperately trying to get a judgement in their favor", "Without more info I can't make a decision.

Funny how that works.  While we don't need to know the specifics, clearly your sibling(s?) did something unforgivable.

That said, I think it's possible that your sister did not encourage your mother to have this reconciliation moment. It think it's entirely possible that after talking to you, she had the idea that she could foster a last minute reconciliation moment and die knowing that her family is reunited. It's a fantasy, but I can see how she might come to that fantasy by herself. It's equally possible your sister had a hand in it. \n\nAll that said, I think that if seeing your mother before she dies is important to you, or is something you'll regret not doing, you need to do it. If the possibility of having to deal with your sisters is more awful than missing the chance to see your mother, then you don't need to do it.

You haven\u2019t provided your reasons, but without any- then I\u2019m going to have to go with YTA because you won\u2019t go see your mother on her deathbed in case you are forced to deal with your sibling/s and really I\u2019m sure you could go there, and ask to see your Mum alone.\n\nInstead you are just not going at all. To me, you could work around this and without any context you do sound like you have created a giant issue without reason \n\nWill you really feel okay later in life not going to visit your dying mother??? \n\nYou may have some really strong reasons for why not, but your post and info in there sounds fairly petty - and you can go see her, and keep sibling interactions to a minimum but really, if it\u2019s a minimal issue you are only hurting yourself and your mother by refusing to see her \n\nI hope you reconsider and am sure you will be able to arrange to see your mother alone for a short time at least alone. I think you will probably regret it if you don\u2019t and also if your unspecified issue is with siblings, then you can still see and honour your mother without having to get into that with them\n\nJust say it\u2019s Mum, I\u2019m here for that and I can\u2019t and won\u2019t get into that now etc", "I can see my mother without my sister, assuming that my mother still wants me to visit. I live overseas and my sister is on the other side of the country as my mother. A short visit means 1-3 days and nights. \n\nMy mother was enthusiastic at the thought of me visiting at first, then came up with the idea that my sister and I should overlap our visits (did my sister suggest this). Since I nixed that idea my mother is very very upset with me. I say shame on my sister for egging my mother on. \n\nNo one seemed in pain about my estrangement until this week. Now my mother is inconsolable. My sister looks like a rose. And I am the stubborn, sulking, unreasonable black sheep causing all this pain to the family. If I do visit, it will be clouded by the horribleness that is me. \n\nWhen my father died it was the same story with a different sister. \n\nUnfortunately", "It\u2019s hard to make any judgment without knowing what led to you being estranged but in this situation I\u2019m going to say NTA.

Yes, but it\u2019s infuriating the way some people think a death or impending death should erase any and all bad feelings.\n\nMy aunt is dying and my mom (her sister) and I have been talking about closure. Our conclusion is that it\u2019s a lie. If you have problems with someone that you can\u2019t work out, they\u2019re not getting solved on a deathbed. My mom loves her sister, but their relationship was always challenging and, with her drifting into dementia, there\u2019s not going to be any sorting through the issues now. My father passed last year after being out of contact with me for 20 years and while I\u2019ve endured as kindly as I can my stepmother telling me he missed me so much and thought of me every day\u2026 it doesn\u2019t change anything. He\u2019s still TA to me for making zero effort.\n\nI do recommend visiting your mother, by yourself, although you may have to endure her talking about reconciling with your siblings. Sometimes telling a dying person what they want to hear is a real kindness so it\u2019s worth considering saying \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d even if you don\u2019t intend to do so. No easy answers in these situations.", "From the information you\u2019ve given - your mother is not asking you to reconcile or have a relationship with your sister.

Unless you know for a fact that she is going to be abusive towards you, I feel like faking niceties for a little while to be with your mom might be worth it. Then again, I do not know the reasons you went NC, nor the dynamics that would be at play. I guess it comes down to what will you regret more? Not seeing your mom again or temporarily being around your sister?

You're allowed to be clear about why you're there, and what you are and are not doing or discussing.
