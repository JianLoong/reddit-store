Her relationship with her late husband/their father was not a happy one. They married too young and were not really good together but he adored my older nephew and was so excited for my younger nephew. He passed away days after the youngest was born. My sister admitted to me she didn't miss having her husband around and realized how unhappy she was with him. She was quickly talking about finding a father for her boys and how they all needed to be part of a loving family. She ended up meeting a widower with children 9 months after her husband died and they moved in together after a year of dating and married six months later. They divorced after a year. The divorce came about because their wishes for the marriage could not be met. She wanted a family for the boys, a dad for them, and any kids in the home to be their siblings. But her ex's kids were not willing to be close to the kids, did not want a new mom, hated their dad being called my nephew's dad. He didn't want to force it on his kids. She wouldn't stay married where her kids were simply tolerated. She admitted while divorcing him that she had never actually asked if his kids would want to have her boys as just brothers. She assumed things would work that way.\n\nWhile she was divorcing her ex-husband she met another man, this time a guy who was divorced, who was older, with older kids, and they were engaged for more than a year. That relationship broke down because his much older kids (older teen and adults) did not want to be doting siblings for my nephew's and essentially ignored their existence outside of the house. They did not seek a relationship beyond casual hi and bye. My sister was so upset about it. She tried pleading with these kids of her ex-fianc\u00e9 to love her boys as brothers and give them the family they deserved. They told her that her boys would always just be kids to socialize with when seeing their dad, not siblings and not people they would count as part of their nuclear family.\n\nNow she's looking again for a new dad for them. I spoke to her about giving it time and taking the time to talk to the boys about their dad more, or at least let them have some more time with their dad's family. She said that would be bad for them. I know from her late husband's sister that their family was heartbroken to see that the boys had no idea who their dad was, and they thought daddy and mommy broke up because his other kids didn't want them. My sister has not really told them that their family is from their daddy. They speak to them and see them very rarely but it's enough for no grandparents rights to take effect. I told her it won't be good for them in the future to realize their dad passed away and that she saw him as disposable. She said a living dad is more important and brought up how she knows I judge her for making the same mistake twice. I said I would judge her if she makes it again instead of accepting reality.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671468952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpwv8b/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_would_judge_her_for/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anything else means you aren't emotionally over it and/or are holding at bitter grudge. \n\nFather of your children died?

Before she got married, did she bounce from boyfriend to boyfriend with little or no time between partners?\n\nThere are some people who can\u2019t be alone and need to always be in a relationship. I know of women who have never gone 24 hours without a boyfriend. Some have new ones lined up before ending the current one. Some will date anyone because they are afraid of being alone\n\nHell a guy I dated years ago encountered this. Ran into a girl he knew from high school, she tells him her boyfriend just dumped and would he be her new boyfriend because she hated being single. Thankfully he saw the red flag and politely declined. She had a new boyfriend before the end of day. That poor guy\u2026\n\nWhere are your parents in all of this? Are they able to help try and talk some sense into her? Would her in-laws be able to take in the boys for a bit to give her some space? Sometimes when people start families too young, they get a bit crazy when they\u2019re suddenly single. They try to act and date like they\u2019re still teenagers completely ignoring their responsibilities to their children. Add in an abusive or toxic or just crappy relationship to the mix and well, you get your sister\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, suggest she go to therapy to help her deal with the lose of her first husband, and the end of her second marriage. But at the end of the day, you can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want to be helped. And just try to do your best to be there for the boys. They will need a stable adult in their lives. Hopefully your parents and his parents will be able to help them as well", "INFO: The boys don't know that their father died? \n\n\"My sister has not really told them that their family is from their daddy.
