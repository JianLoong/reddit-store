I find death less devastating than a breakup in the short term, but more devastating in the long term. so there isn't a death that could affect me more than my breakup in the short term, unless it was the death of my kid (I wouldn't be able to survive that)", ">in the long run this breakup shouldn\u2019t be prioritized over your relationship with your family. those relationships will matter for your whole life - this breakup will not. also, a year or two from now you will likely regret not taking this opportunity to be present and make memories with your son because you allowed your entire family\u2019s holiday to be compromised by someone you dated for one year.\n\nThis is the issue. I know all of this will happen, and I agree. My feelings right now are temporary and they've led to me doing things (bathing in misery) that I will surely regret in the future, but stopping all of that mindset at this moment is impossible. I need time to dissociate things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>i wonder why you seem to understand that his plans shouldn\u2019t have to change because of your breakup, but seem to be okay with upending the plans of two children who have been looking forward to this trip and did nothing to deserve it being cancelled. could you explain that?\n\nI don't think it's OK, otherwise I wouldn't have made this post. I just wanted to see what others think.", "that's a different situation..... if I lived in the same city as my ex, then I would already have preexisting memories of the place. all my other exes were local and I didn't have issues living in the same city post breakup. \n\nPR is different.

It felt as serious or more serious than my 4 year relationship with my kid's mom and the other 2 year relationship I had afterwards. I didn't feel this devastated about those 2 breakups compared to this one. so I don't think length of the relationship is a factor for me when it comes to processing post breakup emotions. \n\nI'm definitely someone that struggles more with getting over shorter relationships than longer ones", "A recent post suggests OP is 30", "1 year", "I guess I have mental health issues that make me feel stronger towards these kind of things, which isn't healthy. I also hold the weight of the issues that led to the breakup, so that also weighs heavily on me. \n\nI wasn't taking my kid there with the intention of meeting her.

Will you be staying in a specific area of PR you associate with her or going to places you went to with her?", "So you want to prioritize a 1 year failed relationship's memories over a healthy positive relationship with children.

He doesn\u2019t need to meet anyone that you aren\u2019t in a serious, long-term relationship with. You cannot introduce him to girlfriends because it\u2019s convenient.

Even when they are adults, situations will arise when you may put them - and your grandchildren - before yourself.\n\nSometimes the only way to do it is main force. You. Just. Do. It. You don't get a medal, you don't get any tangible rewards. It hurts like hell.

You shouldn't have waited until the last minute to cancel. Talk to your kids and say that you're going to FL instead of PR, so they can at least see your Dad. I think you'll regret it more if you let the breakup influence your decision. At least you can go make happy memories with your kids and their grandpa.", "Honestly it sounds like instead of creating Christmas magic for your family- you want a pity party. If you can\u2019t go to PR change the plans and go somewhere else- Florida, mountains, beach etc. if you can\u2019t handle PR fine- but the fact you don\u2019t have a back up plan for the trip is your fault.
