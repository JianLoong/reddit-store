That is your spot and if they want a second parking spot they need to take that up with the building owner/management.", "Perhaps the pregnant neighbor can ask the apartment complex for an extra spot close by?\n\nIt is not your problem, you are paying for that spot, you should be able to use it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It sucks because it's bound to cause ill will and friction, but your choice was continuing to be inconvenienced and have your safety at risk, or have them irritated. It's your spot. They'll have to figure it out.", "NTA - Getting pregnant does not automatically mean you get special treatment. Dr. will even recommend you continue to do your normal daily activities. I'm not saying it's not difficult, but to expect everyone to cater to you as a bit much.. You pay for the spot, the spot is yours. Perhaps a tow truck would help get the point across..", "NTA if parking spaces are assigned to your place.", "Being pregnant doesn't mean the world has to cater to your demands.

It's so frustrating that people let pregnancy be the excuse for everything.  I have had a child, and I was perfectly capable of walking the whole time during pregnancy.", "NTA", "NTA its your assigned spot", "NTA.\nActually you're being too nice. You asked them politely to leave your spot alone.  Next time anyone is in your spot block them in with a note or call a tow truck.

Report them every single time to the landlord (or whomever you're paying for this spot) - insist the spot is either available per your lease or you will seek legal remedy. \n\nI hate to be that person who complains all the time, but this is simple, clear, and completely unfair to you.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to fix their parking issues. You are not inconsiderate for wanting to use the parking spot included in your rent.\n\nFunny how they\u2019ve decided to just harrass one tenant about this.", "I had three with with a disability and never used it as a crutch yes when I got father along and it was harder for me to walk I limited my outings and made my ex so more of the grocery shopping but other then that I never said I couldn't do something because I'm pregnant.", "The woman who lived there before me allowed them to use it so I think they thought it could continue I only been there a month", "That's nice of her but again, they are not entitled to it. She was doing something nice but you are not a bad person for not doing them that favor. They need to make a different plan."]}
