He takes care of the kids & the mortgage. I take care of all bills, car notes/insurance, & major purchases. I have plenty left over to spoil myself & Jim. His relationship with the girls is great, & my relationship is pretty good. We get them for a weekend every month & most breaks. We also try our best to attend extracurricular events.\n\nJim pays child support half of extracurriculars & health insurance costs, but also gives allowance, purchases most of the girls\u2019 clothing, pays for their hair to get done, & more. Their mother does not think it is enough & constantly berates him. She says she barely makes ends meet. I believe her, she is on disability for her asthma, & refuses to work. She has two degrees but says that because she has not worked in 16 years she won\u2019t now.\n\nLately she has been commenting on my lifestyle. She tells Jim that I should help more financially with the girls. He lets her know that the girls aren\u2019t my responsibility finically & that I support them in other ways. He lets me know that he is fine with me doing the extras for the girls (gifts, vacations, nails & such when they are with us).\n\nFor xmas she wants to do as they \u201calways have\u201d where Jim provides $1000 & she buys xmas gifts \u201cfrom mom & dad\u201d.

Note: the girls will be with us on Christmas\n\nAlso, their birthday is coming up & they are turning 16. Jim wants to buy them a car & put it in our name & on our insurance.

If you're contributing any part of that $1K, then you should get a vote, though. If you want to buy your own gifts for the girls, of course, you can do so. \n\nYou make good points about the car insurance situation. While you can't control how Jim spends his own money (again, assuming finances are separate), the kids being on your (plural) insurance makes the car thing your business too. Jim could try to get mom to pay for the insurance - and probably should do that.", "INFO: would Jim be buying the car and paying for insurance, or would it be you?\n\nAlso, a car is not a right or entitlement. Do they have part time jobs to help pay for gas and repairs?", "NTA.  Since when do you get disability for asthma?\n\nDo not put the car in your name and insurance.  You know damn well those girls are not going to drive that car, and you will be liable for any accidents.", "NTA.  The ex-wife needs a swift kick in the posterior to get off her butt and stop being a drain on the OP's husband and on society.  It sounds like she could work, but prefers to milk what she can get.\n\nI also see where buying the kids a car is likely to open up a whole can of worms.  The Christmas gift thing is tougher, but I could see room to split the largesse where $500 goes the traditional route and $500 goes the new route.  \n\nIs there a chance your husband could get full custody instead?  What would the kids prefer?", "I see a lot of comments calling OP TA for wanting to give the girls gifts with her husband and not wanting the gifts to be from \u201cmom\nAnd dad.\u201d Honestly, I think OP is correct with this. The girls know OP is now married to their father and they would be hurt if there were no gifts from her. They are also old enough to realize the dynamics have changed as a result of the marriage. This isn\u2019t some tradition that should be kept up indefinitely. It\u2019s something OPs husband did out of kindness to his ex, and with love for his daughters. It\u2019s honestly time he also includes his wife in his family, especially considering how she is also financially supporting the girls.", "Keep your finances away from him and safe, To him whats his is his & whats yours is his.

If she can't afford to live on what she currently is given/earns she should see a lawyer and get child support or something reassessed. There is a difference between ensuring your step children are taken care of and subsidising the mother. Giving her money so she can buy her children Xmas gifts is subsidising her. That might be an unpopular opinion but it is true. I completely understand why you would expect and want yourself and your husband to buy gifts together for the girls. You're expected to help find their lifestyle/ wellbeing, you want to be included. That is completely fair. If she cannot afford presents herself and this is something your husband won't budge on, then the presents should be from the 3 of you. Or she gets given less money from your husband to buy them presents from her, and you two can buy the girls gifts for Xmas day.", "Leave the Christmas gift thing alone. It\u2019s only a couple more years before the girls turn 18 and this won\u2019t be an issue anymore. YTA on this one.\n\nNTA at all about the car. Your concern with others driving the car is 100% valid because if something were to happen then you\u2019re just as much on the hook financially as your husband. Not to mention the additional wear and tear and increased maintenance costs. There\u2019s a possible middle-ish ground with the car though. Get them the car and put a motion detecting tracker on it. Even LoJack could be an option. Make it very clear to the girls and the ex that the car is the girls\u2019 car and not for anyone else to drive. Tell them all up front that if y\u2019all find out anyone else has been driving it then you\u2019ll take it back. Or you could deregister and uninsure it and not hand over the title for the ex to put it in her name until they\u2019ve pad you back for half the cost of what you paid. Either way, a car is a privilege and abusing that privilege will cause them to lose it.", "I don't see how you can control how the vehicle is managed considering you only see the girls every other weekend. While you are NTA in my opinion leave it up to their father and mother to purchase, maintain and insure the vehicle, otherwise this will only lead to resentment and anger if it's not managed the way you want it to be managed. \n\nAs for Christmas presents why mess with the status quo?  As long as the girls are happy then don't mess with it. Leave it with the parents and purchase your own gifts if you wish. If your husband is ok with letting the ex wife manage the presents let it be. His daughters, his money.", "$1000 for Christmas gifts from their mom and dad is fine. If he wants, he can give her $500 for gifts from mom, and buy his own gifts for his kids on his own. They\u2019re 15. There\u2019s only a few years left of his obligation to their mother. YWBTA to make a fuss over this now. I\u2019m sure the girls know their mom can\u2019t afford this, but considering they live with her, he might as well help her provide a good Christmas for their kids.\n\nNTA for having reservations about the car, and especially car insurance. I would not have a car and car insurance in my name for minors that I could not monitor and enforce rules on. I would not trust that the adults wouldn\u2019t use the car, which could be an issue for many reasons I can imagine. I\u2019m not even sure that you CAN insure a vehicle for minors who don\u2019t live with you. You might look into that. Do the girls have jobs? I would not give a car to kids who can\u2019t afford the insurance, annual registration, gas, and oil changes. This is only a nice gift if it teaches them responsibility and they are prepared to accept those responsibilities. You\u2019re also giving two girls 1 car? What will happen if they go to different colleges? How will they manage sharing it with different work schedules or when they don\u2019t live together? Will this create tension between the two of them and result in fights down the road? \n\nYTA for expecting the mom to chip in half for the car. Despite your feelings about her disability status, and whether or not she should be able to work, it\u2019s obvious that she cannot afford to chip in half. I don\u2019t know what price range their dad is considering, but cars are expensive and you shouldn\u2019t float it out there for her to chip in when she doesn\u2019t even own a car.", "NAH so long as the situation doesn't change. I think the whole 'from mum and dad' thing is dumb, they're old enough to know where the money is coming from, but if you can spare the money, it's a dumb hill to die on for 2-3 annual payments. \n\nThe insurance thing is valid. Can you add them for like 3-6 months and tell them they're responsible for it themselves after that? Gives them some time to find jobs; having a car will make that easier. But only if you want to; their expenses are not your problem, especially since it's a luxury item (and sounds like the adults in the house will utilise it at the girls' expense). \n\nI disagree with the sentiment that you should be contributing to their expenses, especially since it sounds like you largely have seperate finances. They're not yours, and you came into their lives long after the point where they might have grown up with you as a parental figure. But you should also let it go if you can manage with what he's currently paying. It's only a few more years.", "NTA.  You and Jim are a family now.  You and Jim and his daughters are your own unit when they are with you.  It is possible to keep the car in Jim's name only, have the girls covered on Jim's car insurance and specifically exclude all other drivers in the household the girls stay in while they are with their mother.  There could possibly be technology (biometrics) which would exclude others besides the girls from driving the vehicle.  It is worth exploring.  As far as Christmas, at almost 16 the twins are old enough to see through the 'mom and dad' Xmas gift lie.  Make sure Jim educates his ex that tradition is done.", "Difficult one. Now you are married your money is his and vice versa so any large expenditure should be approved by you both. The bio mum has a cheek, refusing to work now and expecting to live partly off your earnings when it comes to the girls. Talk to your husband and find some common grpund but don't bow to the demands of the mother, especially when she is expecting so much. I'd definitely not have the kids on my insurance if there are potentially others in the house who may not be able to be trusted.", "ESH   Stay out of the Christmas present issue if it is your husband's money that is going to the gifts.   I would also advise you to buy the girls a gift or two from you.   I would say that it's fair to say that giving mom the money to do the shopping ends when the girls graduate from high school. \n\nHis ex should not be demanding that you pay any expenses for the kdis,  they have two parents.  \n\nYour husband wants to buy his kids a car that he really cannot afford without your help.  Additionally there is a huge liability issue.  I don't know how far you live from the ex, but I wouldn't be comfortable with buying and insuring a vehicle that didn't stay at my house in this scenario since the ex doesn't have her own car.  If anyone is hurt or injured by your vehicle, it will be you gets sued.", "If Jim (their dad) wants to do these things and provide for them financially so they DONT struggle in their primary home (as long as he talks about it w/ you and doesn't disrespect you)....then LET him. \n\nHowever, if you interfere then yes....YTA", "If Jim can afford to buy the car with cash or take a\ncar loan and pay the car payment \nand pay for the insurance under his name, then great. If you don\u2019t want the liability, then don\u2019t have it in your name. In regards to the gifting, I would not disrupt that tradition. It will just breed resentment, his kids are 15, they are almost 18. His child support obligation is almost over.  Enjoy your life with Jim and try to be empathic for the kids. It sounds like you think the mom lacks motivation so keep in mind they are dealing with that every day. Also being 5 hours away the mom is doing the bulk of the child rearing. If there are two other adults in the house that use the car and maybe get a job from using it fantastic! Maybe it will help the entire family overall and wouldn\u2019t that be a great thing for everyone. It\u2019s not uncommon in a divorce for one person to make a lot more than the ex.  In that case you can\u2019t expect everything to be split 50-50.", "The thing that would worry me is the concern that other people in the home would be driving the car. It sounds like a distinct possibility. As far as the insurance goes, whether you or your husband add the car to your insurance, you will (as a married couple) both be responsible if the girls, God forbid, (or anyone else driving) get in a terrible accident and there are law suits. Do you really want to take that chance?", "NAH. He should not be giving his ex wife money for Christmas. She can figure that out on her own. You and your husband are capable of picking our gifts on your own. Also, I wouldn\u2019t be giving them cars. Too much liability. They are 16, but not entitled to a car. If they want a car they can save, work, take the bus etc.", "YTA on the Christmas gift thing.  Make sure your name is on there but excluding mom knowing she is poor is petty.\n\nNeed more info on the car situation. Under no circumstances should insurance policy be same as yours or under your husbands name, but I\u2019m not convinced there is no workable solution.", "YTA. Why do you care that the gifts appear to be from you instead of their mother? That seems worse for everyone except you.", "Info: so he\u2019s expected to give mom money for Christmas, she buys the gifts, I assume to open with her. But they\u2019re going to be with you on Christmas sooo, are you expected to buy additional presents for them to open with you?", "NTA.  Don\u2019t feel bad.  The girls can have a car in your name in your house.  Not at mom\u2019s house.  At mom\u2019s house mom can have a car in her name for the girls to use.  Or not.  Her choice.  The insurance and liability should not extend to the ex\u2019s household.  That\u2019s a recipe for danger.  That\u2019s how YOU get sued for the ex\u2019s car accident.  \n\nAs for gifts, if it\u2019s your money being spent, you control the spending.  Don\u2019t let the ex take your money for a ride at the mall.", "NTA,  my spouse and I have separate accounts, share home expenses. He can spend his extra income on what he wants( unless saving for vacation,  extra) , me same. He wants to buy a new Harley, I save/ invest. He is usually broke, no extra funds from me for his kids. It was agreed.  I do buy all grandbabe(not mine, but love them, soo fun) birthday, Xmas presents. Keep it separated, everyone needs to know what the limits are. You bend once, game over...2nd Harley, now we have none, not my expense. Plus your spousal kids are old enough to know how finances work.  Need car,/ insurance...jobs.....I  did it, anyone can", "YTA\n\nLet the girls enjoy joint gifts from their father and mother. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about Christmas from their mom and dad. They love both their parents and probably enjoy some stability around the holidays. \n\nLet their father gift them a car if he would like to as well. It\u2019s fine and it\u2019s not hurting you so don\u2019t be mean spirited about it. \n\nAlso, you sound a bit bitter and nasty when you talk about the ex wife\u2019s asthma disability. Don\u2019t be ableist, it\u2019s ugly.", "Yta.  It really isn\u2019t your place to get involved in his support of his children.  It\u2019s a wonderful thing that he and his ex can come together and buy joint gifts for the kids.  It\u2019s super petty to insist your name be on the gifts and leave their mother out.  If he want to buy them a car, stay out of it.  These kids are 15.  You\u2019ve been in their lives for 5 minutes.  Its not your place to dictate how your husband supports them. If you don\u2019t want to be responsible for the car, that\u2019s fair.  No reason for your name to be on it anyway.", "YTA you married a man with kids.

I think it needs to be made very clear who is allowed to drive the car or who's name it will be in.", "OK, so my view is based on some of the stuff from the comments as well as the main text. I've summarised here:\n\n1. OP did not know about the $1k for Christmas thing until after they married. Original post seems to say she did, but OP confirmed in a comment that she didn't.\n\n2. OP and Dad are sharing their first Christmas together as co-habiting partners as well as married ones.\n\n3. On Christmas day, the twins will be with OP and dad and not with mum. My logical assumption, following on from 2 above, is that this will be for the first time.\n\nMy view: NTA\n\nGreat that Dad stands up and does pay for more stuff than his legal obligation requires him to. I just needed to say that, because this sub is filled with posts about people being rubbish parents and he seems not to be being that.\n\nI think on the $1k thing, you need to express this differently. I get that because of the disability situation (and I'm not sure how bad your asthma needs to be to class as a disability but leaving that aside) he wants the twins to have a good Christmas and the kind that their mum can't afford which is why they've had joint gifts for this long, but as Christmas is with you this year, the gifts should be too. Previously, the money has always been so that there are presents for the twins to open on Christmas day from mum and dad. On Christmas day they will be with you and OP. On that basis, happy for him to set aside the $1k to buy gifts from mum and dad, but he buys them and they're under your tree as they'll be with you this year. Next year, if they're with her on Christmas day, she gets the $1k and the presents are under her tree. It gives consistency of experience to the twins and is fair. Do tell him that he needs to agree an end date for this. After all, they aren't married so joint gifts from him and her won't be expected forever. \n\nOn the car, bang on. In all honesty, in my country (UK) the insurance rules are different so I'm not sure exactly what impact it will have putting them on your insurance. However, setting that aside, a car is a significant asset and it wouldn't be right to put that in a situation where it might be ruined or misused (not even if the misuse is not by the recipient of the gift). My question: are there ways you can protect the investment so the girls can have the car which it sounds like OP and hubby are both in favour of, without allowing the possibility of mum using it? That would be easy in the UK (not on the insurance for the car = illegal to drive it - even policies which allow you to drive other cars do not allow you to do that for cars belonging to other members of your household). Can you do something similar? Alternatively, agree to wait until they're turning 18 and need one for university (and won't be living with mum presumably). If not, get them something cool that only they can use. Give them a budget to plan a family holiday for the four of you during one of the breaks and then book it if they like that kind of thing, maybe one of them has a fascination for stamps and there's a good collection you could buy them that they'd really love.", "The insurance is a tricky thing. Once your name is on that car and a bad accident happens? They can come after your assets. Also, most insurance companies won\u2019t insure a car not kept at the same household. So\nYou need to check on that too.", "NTA\n\n16 year olds don\u2019t NEED a car. Plus, it is obvious that he will just be buying a car for his EX and whoever the other adult in the home is.", "You should speak to your insurance agent about the car. If your husband is on the title you both may be liable for any damage caused by that vehicle. Even if the mother has the primary insurance policy. You would be wise to get an umbrella insurance policy just in case something happens to.protect yourself and your property. With that being said, if you're not in the US, then just ignore this.", "NTA. The mom can work but chooses not to", "Why not buy a car for the girls to use when they are at your place? the more you make your home attractive to them. The more likely it is They will want to spend more time with you. I agree about the Christmas money.

If he chooses to get a car, be damn sure he gets a Ring car camera or similar so he can monitor where it goes and with who.", "I\u2019m sorry, but why would a 16 year old need their own car? \nNTA by the way.\nYou are already contributing when they are with you. Are helping with Christmas gifts, and just because the mother wants to put her name and not yours on it should make you give in?\nNah.\nNTA.", "NTA.  Car solution- put it in your name-the girls leave it at your home and only drive it when staying at your home. Split the $1000. Use half for your gifts. Give the other half to the bio mom so she can also buy gifts. You only have a few Christmases left before the girls are 18. Then you won\u2019t be obligated to pay bio mom anything.", "Nta. Not your kids, not your problem. You already do more than enough and the ex is trying to mooch off your money bc she hasn't worked for 16 yrs and doesn't want to try.

When it comes to the Xmas money just give her half or less if you want. Not his job to provide that but if he wants to whatever.  $1000 for gifts for 2 kids is insane! Give her $500 at the most from mom and dad for under her tree. Then you guys can do $500 plus whatever you want to contribute from you and him. \n\nThe car is a hard pass. They're with you 1 weekend a month and a few breaks. They live 5 hours away. You would never see that car to monitor anything and bio mom would 100% use it. She doesn't sound responsible enough for a vehicle and it's not on you to provide one. If they want girls to have one mom needs to hold the car insurance since she's the primary custody holder. It's to big of a risk. Mom sounds like a gold digger. Does she actually spend all the Xmas money on gifts for the girls? Your income isn't part of her support payments, it's his only. If she fights it just say you could always go back to alter the custody agreement. Sounds like you have the more stable home.", "I\u2019d they\u2019re married, isn\u2019t her and his money \u201ctheir\u201d money?

I would be paying for the insurance. I already pay for our two cars.  \n\nThe girls are really good girls they are straight A students, never in trouble.

Because i can. And my kid is a good kid.  She does great in school, volunteers, extracurriculars, and so on. She doesn't have a job because she needs to focus on school.  Is that privileged. Absolutely. So?  \n\n\n\nIf jim can afford it and wants to do it for his kids, that's Jim's business. It is his money and his kids. If all his obligations are met, and he has the cash.

Lol.", "I hope they have prenup or atleast a separate account that his husband can\u2019t easily touch. Sometime i wonder why people marry into this situation and it baffles me how ex partners demands so much from the step parents (who have money)..", "This ^^^^^^^^\n\nDo not , out of your money, buy/insure a car that goes home to their mother\u2019s house. The girls will not drive it, their mom will. She\u2019s unemployed, I\u2019m assuming at home all day, while the girls are at school.

She\u2019s going to be running all over town in her new payment free car. \n\nYou need to draw the line that you are Jim\u2019s family now. If you are pitching in money your name goes on the gifts.

Lol.", "Yes, we would still need to buy additional gifts for our home", "She would be paying for the girls' car insurance. That means it is \"hurting her.\"", "This is giving me mooch vibes. Lol.", "Disagreed.  Step-parents are parents too, and since he is using money that is partially the OP's, she has every right to be involved.  It is not petty to put her name on the gifts when she is helping to pay for them, and the mother isn't contributing squat.", "I would have to help pay for the car, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get it on his own. Also, I pay car insurance for both of our cars. So the car would have to be added to our insurance.", "The bio mom contributes nothing.\nThe gift money is from dad, not joint.\nAnything else is from her supposed disability e.i tax payers.\nThe stepmother has to contribute in order for a car to be purchased in the first place so it is absolutely her business.", "In this same spirit, should I go on my annual solo vacation that I take during Christmas.

There is no logical reason for you to purchase or insure the car. Jim needs to separate his finances from his ex wife. Your idea of the $1000 for Christmas from the two of you is the right approach.  Jim isn\u2019t responsible for his wife\u2019s Christmas presents from his ex.", "This is a tricky one. I agree that the adults in the other house would probably try to use the car. Could you make it crystal clear that if you two got the car, that anyone other than the twins using it would be reported for theft or twoc? I\u2019ve heard of some people protecting their cars with a PIN code, might that be something you could do?", "Don\u2019t do it! The $1K, if that is from Jim\u2019s money outside of the financial agreement you both have, stay out of that. Put your foot down on the vehicle.

Also Jim cannot afford to do this. The post was clear that this would be a joint financial venture between OP and spouse. But even if it was only Jim doing this, if both he and OP are on the deed to the home they share, this can still come back and indirectly screw the OP if there is an accident and subsequent damages or a lawsuit. They can come for their house.

Lol.", "So you're saying she should love and treat them as her own but at the same time she should have no say over big decisions and no inclusion for their Xmas gifts?

It's not OP's responsibility to provide a free car and insurance for the girls and the other people who live in a household that is not hers. Car insurance for teenage drivers is f-ing expensive.

He definitely should have told you that. \n\nI think this should be more of a discussion between the two of you. And the car thing, I'd just say no.

Most working conditions that wouldn\u2019t help her asthma would be in factories or doing manual labor, since she has degrees she likely wouldn\u2019t have to work somewhere like that anyway. \n\nIt\u2019s also treatable, if it\u2019s truly the asthma the reason she can\u2019t work at all, not even a part time job or temporarily to make ends meet, she\u2019d likely be demanding op\u2019s husband to pay for the treatment so she could. As an asthmatic who has experience with the disease , and without projecting my experience too much, if hers is truly that bad then she wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe and would end up in the hospital more often than not due to asthma attacks and wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of her daughters either (the aftermath of an asthma attack leaves you needing nothing more than rest, specially when you have them often)."]}
