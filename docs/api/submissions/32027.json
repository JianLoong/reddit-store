He has two children with his ex-wife, twin girls 15 years old who live 5 hours away. I have no children. I have a great job, I have a rental property, & I have two other side hustles that adds to my income. Jim works full time but doesn\u2019t make as much as me. He takes care of the kids & the mortgage. I take care of all bills, car notes/insurance, & major purchases. I have plenty left over to spoil myself & Jim. His relationship with the girls is great, & my relationship is pretty good. We get them for a weekend every month & most breaks. We also try our best to attend extracurricular events.\n\nJim pays child support half of extracurriculars & health insurance costs, but also gives allowance, purchases most of the girls\u2019 clothing, pays for their hair to get done, & more. Their mother does not think it is enough & constantly berates him. She says she barely makes ends meet. I believe her, she is on disability for her asthma, & refuses to work. She has two degrees but says that because she has not worked in 16 years she won\u2019t now.\n\nLately she has been commenting on my lifestyle. She tells Jim that I should help more financially with the girls. He lets her know that the girls aren\u2019t my responsibility finically & that I support them in other ways. He lets me know that he is fine with me doing the extras for the girls (gifts, vacations, nails & such when they are with us).\n\nFor xmas she wants to do as they \u201calways have\u201d where Jim provides $1000 & she buys xmas gifts \u201cfrom mom & dad\u201d. I let Jim know that this was not ok now that we are married & a family. We can take the $1000 & buy the girls gifts from him & I. He is on the fence & does not think she will have money to buy the girls gifts. I think it is not our problem. Note: the girls will be with us on Christmas\n\nAlso, their birthday is coming up & they are turning 16. Jim wants to buy them a car & put it in our name & on our insurance. I think it is a bad idea because there are 2 other adults in the mom\u2019s home that don\u2019t work /don\u2019t have a car. I think they will bully the girls into \u201cborrowing\u201d the car & it will be more of a communal car.

My compromise is if we could go half on a cash car & their mother pays the other half, put the car in her name & on her insurance. He does not think their mother will be able to come up with the money & he feels bad because if we don\u2019t buy the car, they won\u2019t get one.\n\nI am starting to think that I may the a-hole because I don\u2019t help financially with the girls needs only their wants when they are with us, & I keep saying no to Jim.\n\nAITA because I don\u2019t want Jim to give his ex-wife money for xmas gifts from \u201cMom & Dad\u201d Also, AITA because I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to buy the girls a car in which I would have to help pay for.", "created_utc": 1701313091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1877z05/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_give_his/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're contributing any part of that $1K, then you should get a vote, though. If you want to buy your own gifts for the girls, of course, you can do so. \n\nYou make good points about the car insurance situation. While you can't control how Jim spends his own money (again, assuming finances are separate), the kids being on your (plural) insurance makes the car thing your business too. Jim could try to get mom to pay for the insurance - and probably should do that.", "INFO: would Jim be buying the car and paying for insurance, or would it be you?\n\nAlso, a car is not a right or entitlement. Do they have part time jobs to help pay for gas and repairs?", "NTA.  Since when do you get disability for asthma?\n\nDo not put the car in your name and insurance.  You know damn well those girls are not going to drive that car, and you will be liable for any accidents.", "NTA.  The ex-wife needs a swift kick in the posterior to get off her butt and stop being a drain on the OP's husband and on society.  It sounds like she could work, but prefers to milk what she can get.\n\nI also see where buying the kids a car is likely to open up a whole can of worms.  The Christmas gift thing is tougher, but I could see room to split the largesse where $500 goes the traditional route and $500 goes the new route.  \n\nIs there a chance your husband could get full custody instead?  What would the kids prefer?", "I see a lot of comments calling OP TA for wanting to give the girls gifts with her husband and not wanting the gifts to be from \u201cmom\nAnd dad.\u201d Honestly, I think OP is correct with this. The girls know OP is now married to their father and they would be hurt if there were no gifts from her. They are also old enough to realize the dynamics have changed as a result of the marriage. This isn\u2019t some tradition that should be kept up indefinitely. It\u2019s something OPs husband did out of kindness to his ex, and with love for his daughters. It\u2019s honestly time he also includes his wife in his family, especially considering how she is also financially supporting the girls.", "Keep your finances away from him and safe, To him whats his is his & whats yours is his.

That is something that should have been discussed before you got married, not after. \n\nEspecially because it sounds like he's done this for awhile, without you. I get you don't like the set up, but it's not your arrangement or your kids.", "You are overstepping , the car thing I understand anything else involving his daughters you need to mind your business and watch from the sidelines unless he asks for your input", "ANNNND\u2026this is why people who do not have kids should date/marry people with kids.

The kids always get caught in the crossfire and its terrible for them.", "Jim has nothing but liabilities. I hope you have a prenup.", "NTA. The mom is using your husband and by proxy you for money. If she can't afford to live on what she currently is given/earns she should see a lawyer and get child support or something reassessed. There is a difference between ensuring your step children are taken care of and subsidising the mother. Giving her money so she can buy her children Xmas gifts is subsidising her. That might be an unpopular opinion but it is true. I completely understand why you would expect and want yourself and your husband to buy gifts together for the girls. You're expected to help find their lifestyle/ wellbeing, you want to be included. That is completely fair. If she cannot afford presents herself and this is something your husband won't budge on, then the presents should be from the 3 of you. Or she gets given less money from your husband to buy them presents from her, and you two can buy the girls gifts for Xmas day.", "Leave the Christmas gift thing alone. It\u2019s only a couple more years before the girls turn 18 and this won\u2019t be an issue anymore. YTA on this one.\n\nNTA at all about the car. Your concern with others driving the car is 100% valid because if something were to happen then you\u2019re just as much on the hook financially as your husband. Not to mention the additional wear and tear and increased maintenance costs. There\u2019s a possible middle-ish ground with the car though. Get them the car and put a motion detecting tracker on it. Even LoJack could be an option. Make it very clear to the girls and the ex that the car is the girls\u2019 car and not for anyone else to drive. Tell them all up front that if y\u2019all find out anyone else has been driving it then you\u2019ll take it back. Or you could deregister and uninsure it and not hand over the title for the ex to put it in her name until they\u2019ve pad you back for half the cost of what you paid. Either way, a car is a privilege and abusing that privilege will cause them to lose it.", "I don't see how you can control how the vehicle is managed considering you only see the girls every other weekend. While you are NTA in my opinion leave it up to their father and mother to purchase, maintain and insure the vehicle, otherwise this will only lead to resentment and anger if it's not managed the way you want it to be managed. \n\nAs for Christmas presents why mess with the status quo?  As long as the girls are happy then don't mess with it. Leave it with the parents and purchase your own gifts if you wish. If your husband is ok with letting the ex wife manage the presents let it be. His daughters, his money.", "$1000 for Christmas gifts from their mom and dad is fine. If he wants, he can give her $500 for gifts from mom, and buy his own gifts for his kids on his own. They\u2019re 15. There\u2019s only a few years left of his obligation to their mother. YWBTA to make a fuss over this now. I\u2019m sure the girls know their mom can\u2019t afford this, but considering they live with her, he might as well help her provide a good Christmas for their kids.\n\nNTA for having reservations about the car, and especially car insurance. I would not have a car and car insurance in my name for minors that I could not monitor and enforce rules on. I would not trust that the adults wouldn\u2019t use the car, which could be an issue for many reasons I can imagine. I\u2019m not even sure that you CAN insure a vehicle for minors who don\u2019t live with you. You might look into that. Do the girls have jobs? I would not give a car to kids who can\u2019t afford the insurance, annual registration, gas, and oil changes. This is only a nice gift if it teaches them responsibility and they are prepared to accept those responsibilities. You\u2019re also giving two girls 1 car? What will happen if they go to different colleges? How will they manage sharing it with different work schedules or when they don\u2019t live together? Will this create tension between the two of them and result in fights down the road? \n\nYTA for expecting the mom to chip in half for the car. Despite your feelings about her disability status, and whether or not she should be able to work, it\u2019s obvious that she cannot afford to chip in half. I don\u2019t know what price range their dad is considering, but cars are expensive and you shouldn\u2019t float it out there for her to chip in when she doesn\u2019t even own a car.", "NAH so long as the situation doesn't change. I think the whole 'from mum and dad' thing is dumb, they're old enough to know where the money is coming from, but if you can spare the money, it's a dumb hill to die on for 2-3 annual payments. \n\nThe insurance thing is valid. Can you add them for like 3-6 months and tell them they're responsible for it themselves after that? Gives them some time to find jobs; having a car will make that easier. But only if you want to; their expenses are not your problem, especially since it's a luxury item (and sounds like the adults in the house will utilise it at the girls' expense). \n\nI disagree with the sentiment that you should be contributing to their expenses, especially since it sounds like you largely have seperate finances. They're not yours, and you came into their lives long after the point where they might have grown up with you as a parental figure. But you should also let it go if you can manage with what he's currently paying. It's only a few more years.", "NTA.  You and Jim are a family now.  You and Jim and his daughters are your own unit when they are with you.  It is possible to keep the car in Jim's name only, have the girls covered on Jim's car insurance and specifically exclude all other drivers in the household the girls stay in while they are with their mother.  There could possibly be technology (biometrics) which would exclude others besides the girls from driving the vehicle.  It is worth exploring.  As far as Christmas, at almost 16 the twins are old enough to see through the 'mom and dad' Xmas gift lie.  Make sure Jim educates his ex that tradition is done.", "Difficult one. Now you are married your money is his and vice versa so any large expenditure should be approved by you both. The bio mum has a cheek, refusing to work now and expecting to live partly off your earnings when it comes to the girls. Talk to your husband and find some common grpund but don't bow to the demands of the mother, especially when she is expecting so much. I'd definitely not have the kids on my insurance if there are potentially others in the house who may not be able to be trusted.", "ESH   Stay out of the Christmas present issue if it is your husband's money that is going to the gifts.   I would also advise you to buy the girls a gift or two from you.   I would say that it's fair to say that giving mom the money to do the shopping ends when the girls graduate from high school. \n\nHis ex should not be demanding that you pay any expenses for the kdis,  they have two parents.  \n\nYour husband wants to buy his kids a car that he really cannot afford without your help.  Additionally there is a huge liability issue.  I don't know how far you live from the ex, but I wouldn't be comfortable with buying and insuring a vehicle that didn't stay at my house in this scenario since the ex doesn't have her own car.  If anyone is hurt or injured by your vehicle, it will be you gets sued.", "If Jim (their dad) wants to do these things and provide for them financially so they DONT struggle in their primary home (as long as he talks about it w/ you and doesn't disrespect you)....then LET him. \n\nHowever, if you interfere then yes....YTA", "If Jim can afford to buy the car with cash or take a\ncar loan and pay the car payment \nand pay for the insurance under his name, then great. If you don\u2019t want the liability, then don\u2019t have it in your name. In regards to the gifting, I would not disrupt that tradition. It will just breed resentment, his kids are 15, they are almost 18. His child support obligation is almost over.  Enjoy your life with Jim and try to be empathic for the kids. It sounds like you think the mom lacks motivation so keep in mind they are dealing with that every day. Also being 5 hours away the mom is doing the bulk of the child rearing. If there are two other adults in the house that use the car and maybe get a job from using it fantastic! Maybe it will help the entire family overall and wouldn\u2019t that be a great thing for everyone. It\u2019s not uncommon in a divorce for one person to make a lot more than the ex.  In that case you can\u2019t expect everything to be split 50-50.", "The thing that would worry me is the concern that other people in the home would be driving the car. It sounds like a distinct possibility. As far as the insurance goes, whether you or your husband add the car to your insurance, you will (as a married couple) both be responsible if the girls, God forbid, (or anyone else driving) get in a terrible accident and there are law suits. Do you really want to take that chance?", "NAH. He should not be giving his ex wife money for Christmas. She can figure that out on her own. You and your husband are capable of picking our gifts on your own. Also, I wouldn\u2019t be giving them cars. Too much liability. They are 16, but not entitled to a car. If they want a car they can save, work, take the bus etc.", "YTA on the Christmas gift thing.  Make sure your name is on there but excluding mom knowing she is poor is petty.\n\nNeed more info on the car situation. Under no circumstances should insurance policy be same as yours or under your husbands name, but I\u2019m not convinced there is no workable solution.", "YTA. Why do you care that the gifts appear to be from you instead of their mother? That seems worse for everyone except you.", "Info: so he\u2019s expected to give mom money for Christmas, she buys the gifts, I assume to open with her. But they\u2019re going to be with you on Christmas sooo, are you expected to buy additional presents for them to open with you?", "NTA.  Don\u2019t feel bad.  The girls can have a car in your name in your house.  Not at mom\u2019s house.  At mom\u2019s house mom can have a car in her name for the girls to use.  Or not.  Her choice.  The insurance and liability should not extend to the ex\u2019s household.  That\u2019s a recipe for danger.  That\u2019s how YOU get sued for the ex\u2019s car accident.  \n\nAs for gifts, if it\u2019s your money being spent, you control the spending.  Don\u2019t let the ex take your money for a ride at the mall.", "NTA,  my spouse and I have separate accounts, share home expenses. He can spend his extra income on what he wants( unless saving for vacation,  extra) , me same. He wants to buy a new Harley, I save/ invest. He is usually broke, no extra funds from me for his kids. It was agreed.  I do buy all grandbabe(not mine, but love them, soo fun) birthday, Xmas presents. Keep it separated, everyone needs to know what the limits are. You bend once, game over...2nd Harley, now we have none, not my expense. Plus your spousal kids are old enough to know how finances work.  Need car,/ insurance...jobs.....I  did it, anyone can", "YTA\n\nLet the girls enjoy joint gifts from their father and mother. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about Christmas from their mom and dad. They love both their parents and probably enjoy some stability around the holidays. \n\nLet their father gift them a car if he would like to as well. It\u2019s fine and it\u2019s not hurting you so don\u2019t be mean spirited about it. \n\nAlso, you sound a bit bitter and nasty when you talk about the ex wife\u2019s asthma disability. Don\u2019t be ableist, it\u2019s ugly.", "Yta.  It really isn\u2019t your place to get involved in his support of his children.  It\u2019s a wonderful thing that he and his ex can come together and buy joint gifts for the kids.  It\u2019s super petty to insist your name be on the gifts and leave their mother out.  If he want to buy them a car, stay out of it.  These kids are 15.  You\u2019ve been in their lives for 5 minutes.  Its not your place to dictate how your husband supports them. If you don\u2019t want to be responsible for the car, that\u2019s fair.  No reason for your name to be on it anyway.", "YTA you married a man with kids.

I think it needs to be made very clear who is allowed to drive the car or who's name it will be in.", "OK, so my view is based on some of the stuff from the comments as well as the main text. I've summarised here:\n\n1. OP did not know about the $1k for Christmas thing until after they married. Original post seems to say she did, but OP confirmed in a comment that she didn't.\n\n2. OP and Dad are sharing their first Christmas together as co-habiting partners as well as married ones.\n\n3. On Christmas day, the twins will be with OP and dad and not with mum. My logical assumption, following on from 2 above, is that this will be for the first time.\n\nMy view: NTA\n\nGreat that Dad stands up and does pay for more stuff than his legal obligation requires him to. I just needed to say that, because this sub is filled with posts about people being rubbish parents and he seems not to be being that.\n\nI think on the $1k thing, you need to express this differently. I get that because of the disability situation (and I'm not sure how bad your asthma needs to be to class as a disability but leaving that aside) he wants the twins to have a good Christmas and the kind that their mum can't afford which is why they've had joint gifts for this long, but as Christmas is with you this year, the gifts should be too. Previously, the money has always been so that there are presents for the twins to open on Christmas day from mum and dad. On Christmas day they will be with you and OP. On that basis, happy for him to set aside the $1k to buy gifts from mum and dad, but he buys them and they're under your tree as they'll be with you this year. Next year, if they're with her on Christmas day, she gets the $1k and the presents are under her tree. It gives consistency of experience to the twins and is fair. Do tell him that he needs to agree an end date for this. After all, they aren't married so joint gifts from him and her won't be expected forever. \n\nOn the car, bang on. In all honesty, in my country (UK) the insurance rules are different so I'm not sure exactly what impact it will have putting them on your insurance. However, setting that aside, a car is a significant asset and it wouldn't be right to put that in a situation where it might be ruined or misused (not even if the misuse is not by the recipient of the gift). My question: are there ways you can protect the investment so the girls can have the car which it sounds like OP and hubby are both in favour of, without allowing the possibility of mum using it? That would be easy in the UK (not on the insurance for the car = illegal to drive it - even policies which allow you to drive other cars do not allow you to do that for cars belonging to other members of your household). Can you do something similar? Alternatively, agree to wait until they're turning 18 and need one for university (and won't be living with mum presumably). If not, get them something cool that only they can use. Give them a budget to plan a family holiday for the four of you during one of the breaks and then book it if they like that kind of thing, maybe one of them has a fascination for stamps and there's a good collection you could buy them that they'd really love.", "The insurance is a tricky thing. Once your name is on that car and a bad accident happens? They can come after your assets. Also, most insurance companies won\u2019t insure a car not kept at the same household. So\nYou need to check on that too.", "NTA\n\n16 year olds don\u2019t NEED a car. Plus, it is obvious that he will just be buying a car for his EX and whoever the other adult in the home is.", "You should speak to your insurance agent about the car. If your husband is on the title you both may be liable for any damage caused by that vehicle. Even if the mother has the primary insurance policy. You would be wise to get an umbrella insurance policy just in case something happens to.protect yourself and your property. With that being said, if you're not in the US, then just ignore this.", "NTA. The mom can work but chooses not to", "Why not buy a car for the girls to use when they are at your place? the more you make your home attractive to them. The more likely it is They will want to spend more time with you. I agree about the Christmas money.

New wife shouldn\u2019t impact on the kids and the circumstances. \n\nThe car is less clear - maybe purchase the car and put it on her insurance? \n\nYou married the man and his scenario. His ex wife botching about your circumstances means nothing, you need to deal with it.", "NTA I agree that it's his money and so ultimately his choice but it can be difficult seeing someone you care about clearly taken advantage of and want it to stop", "NAH \nIf it's not hurting your finances the yearly 1k is probably worth it to keep the peace for 3 more years.\n\nThe car however is a different thing.  That's going to to use your money and that's your decision. If you buy them a car it should be used, in they're name and their own insurance, paid for by them.  There's a huge chance 16yo twins and a couple of other unauthorized drivers will be getting in an accident in the next couple years.", "NTA Jim needs to understand that he doesn't have to give money for the mom to play. Mom can work and get herself together or do side hustles but chooses to complain. Buy the children gifts from you guys. If ex can't afford she can say that. Nothing wrong with being honest with the children. For the car I would get it and have it in exs name so she would take the fall for any damages. However the children would still get it. Speak to them about responsibilities and how it's theirs. If mom doesn't have a license she cannot drive it or withhold from them. Actually you might wanna get it in the kids name or you guys so she doesn't sell the car or keep it from them. Actually definitely speak more about it this can be tricky.", "That sounds good in the abstract-- but how are 16 year old girls supposed to afford car insurance--not to mention the liklihood that the mom or other people living in the household will drive the car without insurance??", "This is the correct answer \n\nNAH but you are drifting into AH territory", "As minors, they probably can\u2019t get their own insurance and they\u2019d be even more vulnerable to exploitation by the other adults in the house.", "I agree. But I also see where OP would want to give the girls separate gifts from dad and stepmom as a family unit. Why not split the usual $1k. Heck - give their mom $200 to buy them each a gift from her. Then OP and their dad can buy their own separate gifts for the girls.\n\nI would also be more inclined to offer cash towards a vehicle and let the girls title and insure it themselves or with their mom.", "It must be really bad, like COPD on oxygen bad.", "She might have COPD. My cousin's MIL developed COPD after a lifetime of asthma and was on oxygen for the last decade of her life. But she was in her 70s by then.", ">NTA. Since when do you get disability for asthma?\n\nYeah I call BS on that and either the post is fake or OPs husbands EX is lying and i would be asking hubby to discuss with a lawyer about whether or not they can look into that and adjust CS especially if he is paying that more than the court ordered amount already and she is still needing more.\n\nAs for the car, insurance and gifts, OP is NTA, but if OP did put them on the insurance make it so that only named drivers are covered and ONLY NAME THE KIDS, OP and Husband, keep the cars in OPs name and report the car stolen if husbands ex or her partner drive it (although that would depend on the kids informing OP if that happens)", "Especially now that there are a lot of WFH opportunities, if her issue is not wanting to go ou5 and be exposed to allergens or infections. NTA", "You\u2019d be surprised the lengths people will go to get on disability. My SIL is trying for migraines. She lies, exaggerates, and has even refused to drive for the last year to bolster her case (she\u2019s on her last appeal this month, she\u2019s been denied like 4 or 5 times). \n\nI\u2019m on disability for a horrible blood disease where my organs will literally fail in the next 10 years and it pisses me off to no end when people manipulate the system. And yet my SIL thinks we\u2019re \u201cthe same\u201d.", "\u2018If she can't afford to live on what she currently is given/earns she should see a lawyer and get child support or something reassessed.\u2019\n\n\nOr she can get a damn job, right?! Plenty of people with asthma work. What is she going to do in 3 years when child support stops?! I really don\u2019t understand such mums who refuse to work after a divorce, although sounds like she may have a new partner to depend on.", "Also,mother is aware that child support ends in 2 years? But not your problem just be prepared for another round of guilt when the child support stops getting sent.", "I think OP mentioned that whilst her husband will be forking out $1000 for the gifts, the biomum will get to put her name on it. Why promise kids such lavish gifts that parents can\u2019t afford. \n\nI get it, new step mum is rich and because of this, it can appear \u201cselfish\u201d if she appears reluctant to spend money on the girls. Even if it\u2019s her husband pulling out the money, he is able to do so because stepmom is taking care of other financial matters so he has more to spend on other things.\n\nThe thing is, if she does this, her contribution is unseen and she\u2019s inadvertently buying a gift on behalf of her husbands ex. She doesn\u2019t need to do that. \n\nBut do get the girls a gift from you & your husband, but it does not need to be $1000", "She is also the primary contributor to the home income. That gives her some say.", "Why would OP finance the joy of the mom?", ">He takes care of the kids & the mortgage. I take care of all bills, car notes/insurance, & major purchases. I have plenty left over to spoil myself & Jim.   \n>  \n>He lets her know that the girls aren\u2019t my responsibility finically\n\nHow could you possibly read this and think her and his money is \"their\" money?\n\nNo being married does not make his and her money \"their\" money.  That would be a choice, a choice they very obviously have not made", "I have COPD. I have had to change my job so that I am in less contact with people ( cigarette smoke, perfumes, etc) but have never not worked because of  it.", "Maybe hers is a lot worse than yours.", "That makes me angry. I have migraines that put me in the hospital, the kinds that literally make me blind with pain, and I still work. I should try for disabilities because some days I can\u2019t move with feeling sick (and I\u2019ve definitely lost jobs over my migraine severity/frequency) but I refuse because I prefer to save those benefits for people who truly can\u2019t work and need it. I have a lot of migraine days (15+/mo) but I can still work. Shame on your friend.", "I\u2019d stay firm about the car situation. Maybe compromise that when they move out from their mom\u2019s house that a car can be purchased so it removes the liability of other people driving the car.", "/u/mspooh321", "What also jumped out to me is Jim paying the mortgage. Are you on the deed?", "I agree, I just didn't want to get into a \"she can't work she has health issues\" argument with anyone lol", "Why can\u2019t you and your husband buy the gifts? Still put ex\u2019s name if them if you must, but I don\u2019t see why you need to give her the money to buy them.", "No it does not if he is using his money and been doing this before they were married .. she needs to take a step back", "Though, if buying the car, paying the insurance and upkeep impacts his ability to make the mortgage payments then it's absolutley her business.", "[deleted]", "Haha don\u2019t worry there people on here with bad asthma who are like \u2018thats bullshit, I work!\u2019!", "First off, I don't think so. \"I\u2019d they\u2019re married, isn\u2019t her and his money \u201ctheir\u201d money?\" is the attitude and ridiculous assumption that can be lost. By you.\n\nIt is very obvious they have seperate money. When people have one account and one pot of money they don't even know where the money that goes to each thing comes from. It goes in one pot and mixes. The only way to interpret that the way you said is a massive stretch trying to make it fit the way you want it to. OP did explicitly state he pays for x and I pay for y. That is seperate money. Obviously seperate.\n\nShe also has a comment saying he wouldn't be able to buy the cars alone she would have to help. Seperate money confirmed. As if it wasn't already.", "It was a valid question to a commenter who was also respectful back to me. You are a sad individual. I hope you get the help you need so you can learn to treat people nicely. Both online and in person.", ">It was a valid question to a commenter\n\nIt wasn't though, there was exactly zero reason to question \"If they\u2019re married, isn\u2019t her and his money \u201ctheir\u201d money?\"\n\nAnd \"To me, it sounded like their finances were shared \" wasn't a question it was a statement of your baseless assumption", "Oh, with this information, for sure no on the car. NTA, if you cannot check and be present on who is driving the car, that is a solid no.\n\nNow if your finances are separate,  your husband can scrimp and save extra funds and gift them a lump sum to purchase a car with their mother, but definitely nothing in your name or insurance. Zero guilt of fuck to give about that.", "LOL! Just gotta laugh at this point \ud83d\ude02", "Since when lmao", "Read OP\u2019s replies. Jim needs her help to buy the car and they put the car in their insurance that OP is paying. Obv, is not the only who\u2019s going to spend money on \u201ckids\u201d.", "Tag me under the reply, so I can see it please?", "So my OG comment:\n\n\"If Jim (their dad) wants to do these things and provide for them financially so they DONT struggle in their primary home (as long as he talks about it w/ you and doesn't disrespect you)....then LET him. \n\nHowever, if you interfere then yes....YTA\"\n\n\n\n\nso AGAIN, as long as HE (Jim) pays for the car(s)....fine!! Whatever that means for him budgeting, them creating an equitable house budget, him getting additional sources of income....the responsibility is HIS. \n\nI stated she'd be TA is she interfered.....aka stopped/meddle/cause problems. Otherwise, she's NTA", "thanks for the tag, I still stand by my previous comment....but dad (hopefully) isn't going to buy TWO brand new cars. He should buy starter cars, something safe to get from point A to point B."]}
