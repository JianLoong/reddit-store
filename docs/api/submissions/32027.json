He has two children with his ex-wife, twin girls 15 years old who live 5 hours away. I have no children. I have a great job, I have a rental property, & I have two other side hustles that adds to my income. Jim works full time but doesn\u2019t make as much as me. He takes care of the kids & the mortgage. I take care of all bills, car notes/insurance, & major purchases. I have plenty left over to spoil myself & Jim. His relationship with the girls is great, & my relationship is pretty good. We get them for a weekend every month & most breaks. We also try our best to attend extracurricular events.\n\nJim pays child support half of extracurriculars & health insurance costs, but also gives allowance, purchases most of the girls\u2019 clothing, pays for their hair to get done, & more. Their mother does not think it is enough & constantly berates him. She says she barely makes ends meet. I believe her, she is on disability for her asthma, & refuses to work. She has two degrees but says that because she has not worked in 16 years she won\u2019t now.\n\nLately she has been commenting on my lifestyle. She tells Jim that I should help more financially with the girls. He lets her know that the girls aren\u2019t my responsibility finically & that I support them in other ways. He lets me know that he is fine with me doing the extras for the girls (gifts, vacations, nails & such when they are with us).\n\nFor xmas she wants to do as they \u201calways have\u201d where Jim provides $1000 & she buys xmas gifts \u201cfrom mom & dad\u201d. I let Jim know that this was not ok now that we are married & a family. We can take the $1000 & buy the girls gifts from him & I. He is on the fence & does not think she will have money to buy the girls gifts. I think it is not our problem. Note: the girls will be with us on Christmas\n\nAlso, their birthday is coming up & they are turning 16. Jim wants to buy them a car & put it in our name & on our insurance. I think it is a bad idea because there are 2 other adults in the mom\u2019s home that don\u2019t work /don\u2019t have a car. I think they will bully the girls into \u201cborrowing\u201d the car & it will be more of a communal car. I don\u2019t want Jim & I to be responsible for anything happening if anyone other than the girls drive it. Jim understands & shares my concerns. My compromise is if we could go half on a cash car & their mother pays the other half, put the car in her name & on her insurance. He does not think their mother will be able to come up with the money & he feels bad because if we don\u2019t buy the car, they won\u2019t get one.\n\nI am starting to think that I may the a-hole because I don\u2019t help financially with the girls needs only their wants when they are with us, & I keep saying no to Jim.\n\nAITA because I don\u2019t want Jim to give his ex-wife money for xmas gifts from \u201cMom & Dad\u201d Also, AITA because I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to buy the girls a car in which I would have to help pay for.\n\nUpdate:\n\nA lot of people are asking if I have a prenup, yes I do.  We are keeping finances separate at least until after the girls turn 18 and child support obligations are over.\n\nWe have talked about getting custody of the girls. They don\u2019t particularly care for their home life but they don\u2019t want to leave their friends, school and activities to \u201cstart over\u201d here when they only have two years of school left. They know that they are more than welcome here at anytime.\n\nChristmas money. A lot of people think I have an issue with the amount of money. I absolutely do not. I have a problem with Jim facilitating Xmas in another household.  And then Jim and/or I will still need to facilitate a Xmas here in our household as we will have the girls. I like the idea of the send $500 to their mom and keep $500 to get gifts from us.\n\nThose that say I should just let it be because this is the way it\u2019s been done. Well I usually go on a solo Christmas trip. Should I pack up and go on my trip, because it\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done or should I change things because I have a new family?\n\nI am not trying to bash their mother. She does have really bad asthma. But she also refuses to work in any way shape or form to make sure her children have what they need. She truly thinks it is Jim\u2019s responsibility to take care of her household. I don\u2019t know and really don\u2019t care what she is going to do after the child support payments stop in two years. \n\nThe car, I\u2019ve pretty much told him that the car is a bad idea. Jim and I talked it over last night and settled on that if their mother isn\u2019t willing to insure the car then we would wait until they are 18 before getting them the car.

If you're contributing any part of that $1K, then you should get a vote, though. If you want to buy your own gifts for the girls, of course, you can do so. \n\nYou make good points about the car insurance situation. While you can't control how Jim spends his own money (again, assuming finances are separate), the kids being on your (plural) insurance makes the car thing your business too. Jim could try to get mom to pay for the insurance - and probably should do that.", "INFO: would Jim be buying the car and paying for insurance, or would it be you?\n\nAlso, a car is not a right or entitlement. Do they have part time jobs to help pay for gas and repairs?", "NTA.  Since when do you get disability for asthma?\n\nDo not put the car in your name and insurance.  You know damn well those girls are not going to drive that car, and you will be liable for any accidents.", "NTA.  The ex-wife needs a swift kick in the posterior to get off her butt and stop being a drain on the OP's husband and on society.  It sounds like she could work, but prefers to milk what she can get.\n\nI also see where buying the kids a car is likely to open up a whole can of worms.  The Christmas gift thing is tougher, but I could see room to split the largesse where $500 goes the traditional route and $500 goes the new route.  \n\nIs there a chance your husband could get full custody instead?  What would the kids prefer?", "I see a lot of comments calling OP TA for wanting to give the girls gifts with her husband and not wanting the gifts to be from \u201cmom\nAnd dad.\u201d Honestly, I think OP is correct with this. The girls know OP is now married to their father and they would be hurt if there were no gifts from her. They are also old enough to realize the dynamics have changed as a result of the marriage. This isn\u2019t some tradition that should be kept up indefinitely. It\u2019s something OPs husband did out of kindness to his ex, and with love for his daughters. It\u2019s honestly time he also includes his wife in his family, especially considering how she is also financially supporting the girls.", "Keep your finances away from him and safe, To him whats his is his & whats yours is his.

I get you don't like the set up, but it's not your arrangement or your kids.", "You are overstepping , the car thing I understand anything else involving his daughters you need to mind your business and watch from the sidelines unless he asks for your input", "ANNNND\u2026this is why people who do not have kids should date/marry people with kids. The logistics/money/parenting/moral issues you have to navigate with your partner\u2019s ex could really make or break your peace, and you simply have no control. The kids always get caught in the crossfire and its terrible for them.", "Jim has nothing but liabilities. I hope you have a prenup.", "NTA. The mom is using your husband and by proxy you for money. If she can't afford to live on what she currently is given/earns she should see a lawyer and get child support or something reassessed. There is a difference between ensuring your step children are taken care of and subsidising the mother. Giving her money so she can buy her children Xmas gifts is subsidising her. That might be an unpopular opinion but it is true. I completely understand why you would expect and want yourself and your husband to buy gifts together for the girls. You're expected to help find their lifestyle/ wellbeing, you want to be included. That is completely fair. If she cannot afford presents herself and this is something your husband won't budge on, then the presents should be from the 3 of you. Or she gets given less money from your husband to buy them presents from her, and you two can buy the girls gifts for Xmas day.", "Leave the Christmas gift thing alone. It\u2019s only a couple more years before the girls turn 18 and this won\u2019t be an issue anymore. YTA on this one.\n\nNTA at all about the car. Your concern with others driving the car is 100% valid because if something were to happen then you\u2019re just as much on the hook financially as your husband. Not to mention the additional wear and tear and increased maintenance costs. There\u2019s a possible middle-ish ground with the car though. Get them the car and put a motion detecting tracker on it. Even LoJack could be an option. Make it very clear to the girls and the ex that the car is the girls\u2019 car and not for anyone else to drive. Tell them all up front that if y\u2019all find out anyone else has been driving it then you\u2019ll take it back. Or you could deregister and uninsure it and not hand over the title for the ex to put in her name until they\u2019ve paid you back for half the cost of what you paid. Either way, a car is a privilege and abusing that privilege will cause them to lose it.", "I don't see how you can control how the vehicle is managed considering you only see the girls every other weekend. While you are NTA in my opinion leave it up to their father and mother to purchase, maintain and insure the vehicle, otherwise this will only lead to resentment and anger if it's not managed the way you want it to be managed. \n\nAs for Christmas presents why mess with the status quo?  As long as the girls are happy then don't mess with it. Leave it with the parents and purchase your own gifts if you wish. If your husband is ok with letting the ex wife manage the presents let it be. His daughters, his money.", "$1000 for Christmas gifts from their mom and dad is fine. If he wants, he can give her $500 for gifts from mom, and buy his own gifts for his kids on his own. They\u2019re 15. There\u2019s only a few years left of his obligation to their mother. YWBTA to make a fuss over this now. I\u2019m sure the girls know their mom can\u2019t afford this, but considering they live with her, he might as well help her provide a good Christmas for their kids.\n\nNTA for having reservations about the car, and especially car insurance. I would not have a car and car insurance in my name for minors that I could not monitor and enforce rules on. I would not trust that the adults wouldn\u2019t use the car, which could be an issue for many reasons I can imagine. I\u2019m not even sure that you CAN insure a vehicle for minors who don\u2019t live with you. You might look into that. Do the girls have jobs? I would not give a car to kids who can\u2019t afford the insurance, annual registration, gas, and oil changes. This is only a nice gift if it teaches them responsibility and they are prepared to accept those responsibilities. You\u2019re also giving two girls 1 car? What will happen if they go to different colleges? How will they manage sharing it with different work schedules or when they don\u2019t live together? Will this create tension between the two of them and result in fights down the road? \n\nYTA for expecting the mom to chip in half for the car. Despite your feelings about her disability status, and whether or not she should be able to work, it\u2019s obvious that she cannot afford to chip in half. I don\u2019t know what price range their dad is considering, but cars are expensive and you shouldn\u2019t float it out there for her to chip in when she doesn\u2019t even own a car.", "NAH so long as the situation doesn't change. I think the whole 'from mum and dad' thing is dumb, they're old enough to know where the money is coming from, but if you can spare the money, it's a dumb hill to die on for 2-3 annual payments. \n\nThe insurance thing is valid. Can you add them for like 3-6 months and tell them they're responsible for it themselves after that? Gives them some time to find jobs; having a car will make that easier. But only if you want to; their expenses are not your problem, especially since it's a luxury item (and sounds like the adults in the house will utilise it at the girls' expense). \n\nI disagree with the sentiment that you should be contributing to their expenses, especially since it sounds like you largely have seperate finances. They're not yours, and you came into their lives long after the point where they might have grown up with you as a parental figure. But you should also let it go if you can manage with what he's currently paying. It's only a few more years.", "NTA.  You and Jim are a family now.  You and Jim and his daughters are your own unit when they are with you.  It is possible to keep the car in Jim's name only, have the girls covered on Jim's car insurance and specifically exclude all other drivers in the household the girls stay in while they are with their mother.  There could possibly be technology (biometrics) which would exclude others besides the girls from driving the vehicle.  It is worth exploring.  As far as Christmas, at almost 16 the twins are old enough to see through the 'mom and dad' Xmas gift lie.  Make sure Jim educates his ex that tradition is done.", "Difficult one. Now you are married your money is his and vice versa so any large expenditure should be approved by you both. The bio mum has a cheek, refusing to work now and expecting to live partly off your earnings when it comes to the girls. Talk to your husband and find some common grpund but don't bow to the demands of the mother, especially when she is expecting so much. I'd definitely not have the kids on my insurance if there are potentially others in the house who may not be able to be trusted.", "ESH   Stay out of the Christmas present issue if it is your husband's money that is going to the gifts.   I would also advise you to buy the girls a gift or two from you.   I would say that it's fair to say that giving mom the money to do the shopping ends when the girls graduate from high school. \n\nHis ex should not be demanding that you pay any expenses for the kdis,  they have two parents.  \n\nYour husband wants to buy his kids a car that he really cannot afford without your help.  Additionally there is a huge liability issue.  I don't know how far you live from the ex, but I wouldn't be comfortable with buying and insuring a vehicle that didn't stay at my house in this scenario since the ex doesn't have her own car.  If anyone is hurt or injured by your vehicle, it will be you gets sued.", "If Jim (their dad) wants to do these things and provide for them financially so they DONT struggle in their primary home (as long as he talks about it w/ you and doesn't disrespect you)....then LET him. \n\nHowever, if you interfere then yes....YTA", "If Jim can afford to buy the car with cash or take a\ncar loan and pay the car payment \nand pay for the insurance under his name, then great. If you don\u2019t want the liability, then don\u2019t have it in your name. In regards to the gifting, I would not disrupt that tradition. It will just breed resentment, his kids are 15, they are almost 18. His child support obligation is almost over.  Enjoy your life with Jim and try to be empathic for the kids. It sounds like you think the mom lacks motivation so keep in mind they are dealing with that every day. Also being 5 hours away the mom is doing the bulk of the child rearing. If there are two other adults in the house that use the car and maybe get a job from using it fantastic! Maybe it will help the entire family overall and wouldn\u2019t that be a great thing for everyone. It\u2019s not uncommon in a divorce for one person to make a lot more than the ex.  In that case you can\u2019t expect everything to be split 50-50.", "The thing that would worry me is the concern that other people in the home would be driving the car. It sounds like a distinct possibility. As far as the insurance goes, whether you or your husband add the car to your insurance, you will (as a married couple) both be responsible if the girls, God forbid, (or anyone else driving) get in a terrible accident and there are law suits. Do you really want to take that chance?", "NAH. He should not be giving his ex wife money for Christmas. She can figure that out on her own. You and your husband are capable of picking our gifts on your own. Also, I wouldn\u2019t be giving them cars. Too much liability. They are 16, but not entitled to a car. If they want a car they can save, work, take the bus etc.", "YTA on the Christmas gift thing.  Make sure your name is on there but excluding mom knowing she is poor is petty.\n\nNeed more info on the car situation. Under no circumstances should insurance policy be same as yours or under your husbands name, but I\u2019m not convinced there is no workable solution.", "YTA. Why do you care that the gifts appear to be from you instead of their mother? That seems worse for everyone except you.", "Info: so he\u2019s expected to give mom money for Christmas, she buys the gifts, I assume to open with her. But they\u2019re going to be with you on Christmas sooo, are you expected to buy additional presents for them to open with you?", "NTA.  Don\u2019t feel bad.  The girls can have a car in your name in your house.  Not at mom\u2019s house.  At mom\u2019s house mom can have a car in her name for the girls to use.  Or not.  Her choice.  The insurance and liability should not extend to the ex\u2019s household.  That\u2019s a recipe for danger.  That\u2019s how YOU get sued for the ex\u2019s car accident.  \n\nAs for gifts, if it\u2019s your money being spent, you control the spending.  Don\u2019t let the ex take your money for a ride at the mall.", "NTA,  my spouse and I have separate accounts, share home expenses. He can spend his extra income on what he wants( unless saving for vacation,  extra) , me same. He wants to buy a new Harley, I save/ invest. He is usually broke, no extra funds from me for his kids. It was agreed.  I do buy all grandbabe(not mine, but love them, soo fun) birthday, Xmas presents. Keep it separated, everyone needs to know what the limits are. You bend once, game over...2nd Harley, now we have none, not my expense. Plus your spousal kids are old enough to know how finances work.

It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about Christmas from their mom and dad.

It\u2019s fine and it\u2019s not hurting you so don\u2019t be mean spirited about it. \n\nAlso, you sound a bit bitter and nasty when you talk about the ex wife\u2019s asthma disability.

It\u2019s a wonderful thing that he and his ex can come together and buy joint gifts for the kids.  It\u2019s super petty to insist your name be on the gifts and leave their mother out.  If he want to buy them a car, stay out of it.  These kids are 15.  You\u2019ve been in their lives for 5 minutes.  Its not your place to dictate how your husband supports them. If you don\u2019t want to be responsible for the car, that\u2019s fair.  No reason for your name to be on it anyway.", "YTA you married a man with kids.

I think it needs to be made very clear who is allowed to drive the car or who's name it will be in.", "OK, so my view is based on some of the stuff from the comments as well as the main text. I've summarised here:\n\n1. OP did not know about the $1k for Christmas thing until after they married. Original post seems to say she did, but OP confirmed in a comment that she didn't.\n\n2. OP and Dad are sharing their first Christmas together as co-habiting partners as well as married ones.\n\n3. On Christmas day, the twins will be with OP and dad and not with mum. My logical assumption, following on from 2 above, is that this will be for the first time.\n\nMy view: NTA\n\nGreat that Dad stands up and does pay for more stuff than his legal obligation requires him to. I just needed to say that, because this sub is filled with posts about people being rubbish parents and he seems not to be being that.\n\nI think on the $1k thing, you need to express this differently. I get that because of the disability situation (and I'm not sure how bad your asthma needs to be to class as a disability but leaving that aside) he wants the twins to have a good Christmas and the kind that their mum can't afford which is why they've had joint gifts for this long, but as Christmas is with you this year, the gifts should be too. Previously, the money has always been so that there are presents for the twins to open on Christmas day from mum and dad. On Christmas day they will be with you and OP. On that basis, happy for him to set aside the $1k to buy gifts from mum and dad, but he buys them and they're under your tree as they'll be with you this year. Next year, if they're with her on Christmas day, she gets the $1k and the presents are under her tree. It gives consistency of experience to the twins and is fair. Do tell him that he needs to agree an end date for this. After all, they aren't married so joint gifts from him and her won't be expected forever. \n\nOn the car, bang on. In all honesty, in my country (UK) the insurance rules are different so I'm not sure exactly what impact it will have putting them on your insurance. However, setting that aside, a car is a significant asset and it wouldn't be right to put that in a situation where it might be ruined or misused (not even if the misuse is not by the recipient of the gift). My question: are there ways you can protect the investment so the girls can have the car which it sounds like OP and hubby are both in favour of, without allowing the possibility of mum using it? That would be easy in the UK (not on the insurance for the car = illegal to drive it - even policies which allow you to drive other cars do not allow you to do that for cars belonging to other members of your household).

Split the customary $1k he gives for presents three ways-- so she gets $335 to buy presents from \"mom\"  and you and your husband get $665 to buy presents from \"dad and stepmom\". \n\nMake it clear to the ex that this arrangement will just be until they turn 18. \n\nThe real elephant in the room is that you have an ex who has two degrees and is refusing to work because of asthma (a condition that MILLIONS of people here in the US have and still get up and go to work [ever.single.day](https://ever.single.day).)\n\nIn two years that child support is likely going to stop-- not sure what his legal arrangements are or what child support looks like if you live out side of the US-- and the ex is going to need to support herself for the rest of her life without that monthly stipend from your husband. \n\nHe needs to sit down with her NOW and give her the lay of the post child support landscape while there is still time for her to find suitable work or vocational rehab.  I suspect she intents to keep badgering him for money OR that she'll expect the girls to forgo college and support her. \n\nALSO who are the other people living in the house with your stepdaughters?", "partial, soft YTA. You both sound like a responsible parent and stepparent. \n\nYour concerns about the car are TOTALLY reasonable.

Do you want to appease their mother just to keep the peace? There are pros and cons to every decision. Maybe starting new traditions will start building even stronger bonds that you and their father have with them. Maybe keeping the peace is a great short term but then long term you'll find their mother taking advantage of your kindness.

I have other friends that had to buy their own cars with the minimum wage jobs they got after school and were financially dependent at 17. You'll have to decide what works for your family... My point in all this is just to tell you that you shouldn't feel like you are expected to do anything other than what works for you, your husband, and your step kids as a unit and a family.", "NTA. The mother showed some greediness toward you and taking it seriously is the only way to stop it before escalates", "NTA honestly his ex has been skating by for years.

Why is that a problem? You say you are well-off financially, you\u2019re willing to consider buying these girls a car, but $500 for Christmas, which is a long-standing agreement between hubby and his ex is a problem?  You bringing up your solo Christmas trip is ridiculous. You married a man with children. If you weren\u2019t willing to change your life for him and then you should divorce him now. \nYou sound very selfish, which isn\u2019t surprising given you are nearly 40 and never had children. \nYou need to back off trying to control how your husband interacts with his ex-wife regarding their children. \nYour concerns about the car are valid. I would first discuss with your husband if the girls truly need a car.

If she wants to buy them gifts she can get a job.", "NTA, but... I would leave the Christmas present arrangement be. The girls are 16. I'd let things remain as they have been this Christmas and next. That way your marriage to their father will not be seen as something that changed how they experienced Christmas before adulthood. Your husband should warn his ex that the arrangements change the first Christmas the girls turn 18.  Get them each a nice gift from you, and you can do joint presents with your husband when they are adults if you want. Honestly, my stepfather always gave me a gift separate from my mom's, and it never seemed odd even though my dad had died. \n\nAs to the car - I would not fund that, nor would I insure it. They are 5 hours away so neither your husband nor you will be able to monitor the situation or enforce ground rules. You've made it clear that there are other adults living in the house and you will not be able to stop them from using the vehicle. Your insurance rates will go through the roof. I guess you could offer to do the car if the girls moved in with you, but I'd make the offer gently, acknowledging that you know they would not want to do it since they are in high school. If there would have been any custody changes, it should have happened before they started grade 9. If this was something that the girls proposed, the reason for no I'd give them is that you could not make the vehicle insurance work with 5 hours of distance between your households. Don't tell them it's mainly because you don't trust their mother. That will only breed resentment. Be careful with their emotions and diplomatic, and hopefully the next few years will open their eyes to what kind of person their mother really is.

You are doing right by keeping things separate, that you have a pre-nup, and not wanting the car on your insurance, especially if it's 5hrs away with a different household, would be different if the car was at your place, but since they don't live with you that would also be a bit silly.\n\nYou are not an AH for not providing their needs and only their wants. The needs is the responsibility of the parents. Plus if you start funding needs where will it stop for you? Their college fund? House deposit? Wedding? Obviously if you want to help with those things I'm sure your husband and the girls would appreciate it, I'm just trying to show where it might lead if people start feeling entitled to your money, especially his ex-wife.

Saying the presents are from mom and dad versus Mom and OP? Not critical. The girls know who provides and who to think. OP gets more points from stepping back from that, or from compromising and saying: Mom, Dad, and OP.\n\nThe car: you can\u2019t compromise on this. The girls can\u2019t have a car as long as they live with their mother. Too much liability For you guys on the line.", "Even with a prenup, in some states she would be liable if the car(s) given to the daughters has an accident. Doesn't matter if the drivers are the daughters or not, they could be sued, and the courts will include her as part of the lawsuit. Personally, I think they should wait until the daughters are 18, then buy the cars and put them in the daughter's names and they can assume the liability.\n\nHonestly, I think Jim has no backbone. He sounds like he feels guilty that he is living better than the mother of his kids, but I have a hard time believe she only has asthma and got disability, especially with two degrees. Usually if you have a college degree, it's harder to qualify for disability, since you have many desk job options.", "You can get disability if your asthma progresses to COPD....but this happens to a woman   in her late 30s or late 40s from congenital disorders, or bad drug/alcohol/nicotine use.

It would take some work but in theory you could track them by phone location with \u201cfind my\u201d or some other app and track this car to check that at least one of the girls is with the car? I get this is time consuming and not a perfect solution but it\u2019s worth considering.\n\nETA: NTA for feeling this way but it may be best to compromise for the girls. I\u2019m sure they see it and appreciate it. It sucks his ex is a dead beat and a leech. If the genders were reversed that\u2019s what everyone would be calling her.

With two degrees and the WFH culture I find it hard to believe she can\u2019t manage ANY work at all. The fact she\u2019s shacking up with two other unemployed adults is odd. I suppose I\u2019d begrudgingly suggest that there 3 parents here. He can give the ex $500 to buy gifts, keep $500 to spend himself, and you should spent $500 for gifts from you (or combing yourself and his as together).
