They went through your private stuff and broke sentimental letters meant for you and only you. And their excuse was that they wanted to read them? Invading your privacy and breaking your stuff. I'm sorry about your girlfriend, I hope she recovers", "NTA. The fact they knew what those letters were and they didn't even try to be careful with them is complete bs.

I am so so sorry that your girlfriend has cancer. Those letters were priceless. I can\u2019t believe that these my took them out of your bag at all, much less destroyed them.

And they damaged something incredibly sentimental bc.... they couldn't contain their excitement and curiosity and ripped things apart in their fervor?! WTF. \n\nMy condolences on your gf's illness.", "During this whole time my brother has been telling me to move on. That I need to get over this. He wants me to stay with her but that I should end my feelings because he thinks her death is inevitable and when that happens it would hurt. I hate him for this", "Gently, friend, your brother is right that it WILL hurt.    He's trying in a misguided way to look out for you. \n\nListen to him,  acknowledge what he says, but do what YOU want.  They're YOUR feelings to manage.", "It doesn't have to end with her dying. It's not confirmed by anyone. Everyone assumes she'll die", "Cancer or not, but the fact that writing letters has become such a rare thing, it has way more sentimental value than what it had in past. Week long suspension is not enough.", "NTA i'm so sorry to hear that your girlfriend has cancer, wishing her all the best in her treatment (f\\*\\*\\* cancer). but you were totally in the right to report those girls, they had no right to violate your privacy like that. i hope you're doing okay OP.", "NTA\n\nFirst, I'm sorry for what you and your girlfriend are going through. This can't be easy on either of you. I pray that you both find the strength and comfort you need. \n\nSecond, these girls had no right to go through your personal belongings, nor did they have any right to read your personal letters. They certainly didn't have the right to destroy your property, \"accident\" or not. \n\nI'm glad you went to the principal and reported this violation. I'm even happier that something was done about it. It was not an overreaction on your part at all. \n\nI really hope these girls learned something from this, but somehow I doubt they did.", "NTA  They destroyed something valuable to you that can never be replaced.

It's invading your privacy for a start. And if they were that concerned about being in trouble they wouldn't have done it", "NTA \n\nHang in there, cancer is hard. It's hard for everyone, trust me. Find yourself a cancer support group for close friends and family. Mine is on SM and it works for me. \n\nWhile your brother thinks he's helping, he definitely is not. He's what my cancer crew would call a cancer muggle. Because he says things he shouldn't, about things he doesn't understand. \n\nMy best to your gf, you and her loved ones.", "NTA. You don\u2019t go into other peoples bag, and you don\u2019t mess with sentimental items. These aren\u2019t \u2018just letters\u2019.

The first two were like a sequel so I stapled them. They happened to tear those one..", "Have you told him that? If you have next time he  starts to say something just hold your hand up and say no, that's not what I need right now I'm aware of all the possibilities so I dont need to be told anymore.", "Yeah, I understand. This sucks super bad. Did the girls properly apologized?", "How do you just 'end your feelings'? And what's wrong with grieving for a beloved person? The brother should be supporting OP in my opinion.", "I've told my parents the first time they made me realise. He knows too but thank you", "They did Infront of the principal atleast", "People without the emotional attachment to hope for the best will prepare for the worst long before those with attachment will. \n\nI do think brother's intent is to protect you from potential pain. But you should tell him that it hurts more to see others \"give up\" when you haven't. Especially if those people are close to you.", "Tell them everytime they start. Don't allow them to finish their sentence. Interject your thoughts upon them instead of them on you.", "Thank you sm I will", "Certainly will"]}
