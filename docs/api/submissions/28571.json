So they were venting their worries in a private setting after the meeting.\n\nIf you hadn't intervened and shared their worries directly to your brother there might have been a bunch of other meetings in which they would have the opportunity to build a better picture of what his gf is like and if she really cares about your brother or has different motives.

Maybe your brother suspected they thought so, but until he asks them directly probably they would have kept their tongues in front of him. Now he knows for sure and is this benefitting him in any way? Your parents don't have the opportunity to change their opinion in their own time, because they are now branded by what you revealed without their concent. Your brother don't have the benefit of thinking/hoping that his parents like his partner from the get go.

Would you like your potential future partner to share with his coworkers what you are telling to him in the bedroom? There are different levels of private information and conversations.", "Yeah, your parents are the big mouth rats here, not you.

She met the girl, talked and had dinner with her, waited for her to leave, then formed her opinion. That's like 2-3 hours. And even after I pushed back and after I disclosed everything to my brother, she doubled down on her statements and made it clear that she thought the girl was a gold digger. So for about a week now, she has had this opinion.\n\nMy brother was very wary about dinner with my parents. He had a bunch of demands before he agreed to come over.

You think I'm trying to strain my brother's and parents' relationship because I want to inherit everything? What gives you that impression?\n\nMy parents accused my brother's gf of being a gold digger without evidence. All I did was tell him what they were saying behind his back. Whether he reconnects with them is his choice.", "Respectfully, I know my parents. When they form their opinion of someone, they are very unlikely to change. \n\nAlso, them voicing their opinions on this girl that they have only known for about two hours while I am in the room is very different from a private thoughts, or what's being told to a partner in the bedroom. They stopped being private thoughts the second my mom spoke them in my presence. She had time to think them over, and decided to speak them while I was around.", "Obviously from their reaction afterwards, including saying to you that it was a private conversation, they considered it as such. And I agree, you know your parents, maybe they would never change their opinions. But your brother and his partner wouldn't have known about them unless the parents actually say them out loud. And maybe your parents would have kept their mouths shut because they obviously want to reconcile with your brother.\n\nNow you are talking about rocky relationship, but you also say you are still living with them out of financial reasons. So they are taking care of you and you still live in their home and share their private space. So you \"being around\" and them having this \"in your presence\" is a benefit to you that they extend to still support you and that you can live with them.
