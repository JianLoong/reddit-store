Do you really want to continue living with this person?\n\nI agree with the other commenter-see if there is something in tenants rights that would require a landlord to act on this situation.\n\nIn the meantime, do you have a relative you/the kitten can stay with? That sounds unlivable for humans and kitties", "NTA\nIf you\u2019re roommate is so careless that she just ignores/let\u2019s a flea problem get so bad for her own animals then she probably shouldn\u2019t have any to begin with. It\u2019s bordering on animal abuse for her to completely just ignore such a infestation. She should not be responsible for these animals if she can\u2019t even keep with monthly preventative care. \n\nI would most definitely ask her to pay for at least half the vet bills of your kitten and then immediately find a new place to live if you can. If she cares so little about her own animals and lets her house get so bad infested with fleas I don\u2019t think this is someone you want to be living or for your kitten to grow up with. I hope you\u2019re baby gets better soon!", "NTA. This is so sad, and your roommate is the asshole.  Completely disgusting and unethical. She should pay the entire bill. This is entirely her fault. I hope you can move someplace else ASAP.", "INFO: Is the roommate also the landlord who's renting out the place? If not, is it possible that it's the landlord's fault and it's causing both of you problems rather than something that's coming from the roommate's negligence?", "ESH, do you guys ever check out the house? Like isn't it a basic rule when you going to rent or share an apartment that you need to check the house? It is your negligence for not checking it and putting a poor animal in flea invested the place. And is she the house owner or even someone else homeowner, does not it fall upon the homeowner to do flea removal service? Yeah, the homeowner is in the wrong but you were also negligent in taking care of the cat. As a cat owner, you are more likely expected to visit the house. Look up health codes or housing laws to do flea removal services and get payments for the vet. And for god sake, move your cat somewhere else for the time being.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA.", "NTA, but as other posters have mentioned you do have a much bigger issue than just the current vet bill- what on earth are you going to do about your living situation longer term? Can you get out of your contract if you provide proof to the landlord of the unsanitary living conditions? \n\nAlso, I highly doubt a person that lied to you, appears to possibly be heavily in denial about their ability to care for animals and themselves is going to ever agree to pay up in this situation - you might be better off concentrating on getting out of there- good luck to you and kitty x", "Nta. At night put blue dawn and water into several small bowls around the apartment. The fleas will jump into them and die", "We definitely do not want to stay. We are looking for another place. This is honestly the icing on a cake that\u2019s just rotten all around. \n\nWe do not have any other options right now. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating because we just got out of an even worse situation, thinking this was the break we\u2019ve been waiting and fighting for. Now we\u2019re back to square one of rehoming ourselves.", "I didn\u2019t add it to the post so as to keep it concise, but I will reply to this comment with full disclosure: she is incredibly negligent for more reasons than this. \n\nHer single ferret is kept in a tiny cage with pine shavings and is fed the same Friskies kibble her cats get. If you know anything about ferrets, you\u2019ll understand how terrible all of that is. \n\nShe is breeding her cats because they had an oops litter and she was able to sell them for a decent profit to someone who happened to think the litter was cute. She is hoping this will happen again. This came to light after we had moved in and were told they were fixed. \n\nHer bearded dragon is under a single heat bulb with no substrate, is fed some sort of reptile kibble? and is tossed a handful of crickets at a time that aren\u2019t gut loaded or coated in calcium powder. \n\nMoreover, when we moved in, she became incredibly scarce. We\u2019ve been here a month and I think she\u2019s stayed here about a week total. She basically lives at her mothers house and comes in on the weekends. This is fine by us in terms of privacy, but is incredibly irritating because now I am responsible for all of these animals while she is gone. It has been a fight to get her to pay for litter and food. Most of her animals live in her room, which suits us fine because the smell is contained to that, but it breaks my heart to think that at least two of them are slowly dying. We absolutely cannot afford to pay for them and she is incredibly dismissive about bettering their care. I do what I can, but I have my own obligations and no money to spare. \n\nWe are currently looking for another place. This has been disheartening because she put on a really good facade to get us here, and because we left a (somehow) worse situation to be here.", "No, she is not the landlord. She was on the lease, and then added us on when we moved in. This is an apartment.", "You do know you can treat for fleas inside the house, yes? Get rid of the fleas in the house, put all the animals on flea meds and make her pay for her animals flea meds and the flea treatment costs.", "Please report this person to your country's animal control", "Can they really do anything, though? Maybe besides the fleas, I feel like their \u201cbasic needs\u201d are met, even if they are met incorrectly. They have food and water. There aren\u2019t any laws that are species-specific, to my knowledge. \n\nBy all means, if I\u2019m wrong please correct me and I totally will but i am sad to say I don\u2019t think anything would come of it.", "Asking them if they can do something is better than doing nothing at all. The animals need help, you cannot afford to help them, they aren't your financial responsibility, and your roommate is basically abandoning them for days at a time. If Animal Control can't help, contact animal rescue groups. Maybe they can convince your roommate to surrender the animals.", "If she\u2019s not even taking care of them herself most of the time? Yes, like honestly none of these animals deserve to live in that. And if she\u2019s barely paying for litter/food on top of rarely taking care of them? More fuel. Tbh I\u2019d be willing to throw some money your way to help them, but I don\u2019t know how comfortable you\u2019d feel with that especially with them not actually being your pets. \n\nHer letting them all be screwed over is already disgusting but using the cats to try and make some money while barely taking care of them???"]}
