Why are you expected to support your family, especially your older brother.  I understand your dad paid for your college, did the same for your brother but your brother has never worked all these years.  Your money that you earn from doing your job is not up for grabs by your dad or brother.  I found it strange you made no mention of your mom at all.  The men in your family are TA, not you.

It's such a pity that you're getting paid just enough to pay your bills and, if you feel like it, to send a small amount to your dad. Play pretend. It's sad, but your family doesn't want you to be an independent person, this is a way to keep you in their control, no matter how far from them you might be.

In this day and age I'm not really sure what you're saying! Lol", "she is a woman. I think you did the same as me, she is 25f and the brother is 28m . i originally had it as \u201cyoung man\u201d"]}
