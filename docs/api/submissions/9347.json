He's always been aware of his adoption as my husband and I have never hidden it from him, but we've also never made a big deal out of it either. He's just a regular kid and we love him just as much as we would any biological child.\n\nYesterday, we were all at my husband's parents' house for a family gathering. The situation started when my 4 year old niece innocently asked why my son's skin was a different color than everyone else's, not knowing about his adoption. Before I could even respond, one of the grandparents said, \"That's because he's from a different planet!\". Fortunately, no one laughed. However, my son turned red and looked down, seemingly upset and embarrassed, and didn't say anything.\n\nI immediately stood up for my son and told the grandparents that they were being disrespectful, but they just laughed it off and continued making jokes about his adoption to my son's cousins. My husband also stood up for our son and told them to stop, but the grandparents just ignored us and said we were being sensitive.\n\nThe situation just escalated and it became clear that the grandparents had no intention of stopping. I didn't want my son to feel any more uncomfortable or embarrassed. This was not the first time that his step-grandparents had made these kinds of jokes about him. It was becoming a regular occurrence at family gatherings, and my son was getting increasingly upset each time. I felt like I needed to step in and put a stop to it, so I decided to take him and leave the gathering.\n\nMy son was quiet on the way home, but when I asked him how he was feeling, he simply replied, \"I'm adopted.\" This broke my heart and I could tell he was hurt by the whole situation, and I feel terrible that I hadn\u2019t done anything until yesterday.\n\nI'm now considering never meeting the grandparents again because, as I said before, this has happened more than once, and I don't want my son to continue to be the target of their jokes.\n\nMy husband was not happy with my decision to leave and thought it was going too far. He complained that I was overreacting and that I should have stayed and dealt with his parents. He told me that it was his family and that I needed to be more understanding.\n\nWas I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE!: I just had a heart-to-heart conversation with my son and I'm left completely shocked by his confession. Apparently, they say even worse things (I will not give details) when my husband and I are not around and my son had never said anything because he didn't want to cause problems and upset anyone. I am absolutely appalled by what I have learned and after our discussion I have made the decision to NEVER visit my husband's parents again, as I will not subject my son to any further emotional harm. This is straight up abuse and I am even considering suing them. I will definitely have a talk with my husband.", "created_utc": 1675742439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vrxnl/aita_for_standing_up_for_my_son_and_causing_a/", "score": 729, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course, I tend to be an asshole alot, so I most definitely would have gone off on them before leaving. \n\nFurthermore, your husband is UNDERreacting, here. Family or not, they were horrible to your son. I'm sorry, but just because someone is blood does NOT give them a pass to be mean, cruel, insensitive and all around....well, I'll stop there so I don't get banned. Bottom line, sometimes you have to walk away from family when their behavior is toxic, but even more so when that toxic behavior is directed towards a child. \n\nI'm sure you've done this already, but please, do everything you can for your son, letting him know how blessed and loved he is. See, most kids are simply just \"born\" to their parents, which isn't a bad thing.  You, on the other hand, CHOSE him. He has to know how awesome that is that out of all the kids who were up for adoption, you and your husband chose him. And he's no less your son than had he been a biological son. Trust me, I kind of speak from experience here. My step-dad \"adopted\" me and my brothers, after marrying our mother in the early 80's. It's not quite the same, but still. He chose to do that for us, because of his love for us. It's always a wonderful feeling being chosen. Please, let your wonderful son know how special he is. (I'm sure you are.

Transracial and transnational adoptions are hugely harmful to the children who go through it, and there are massive communities of adults who are speaking out about it. Just because you go through the world with blinders on about racism, you should not have assumed that\u2019s ojos be your son\u2019s experience and you failed him by putting him in that situation to begin with. Everyone but the son is the asshole in this case. \n\nDo better, his life depends on it.", " NTA but tell your husband clearly \"This is a hill I'm willing to die on. I won't stop you visiting your family but if you want a home where your parents are welcome and a wife who tolerates them, then that is the end of our marriage. I'm sorry its escalated so quickly but their abuse was hidden from me and if hearing about it doesn't change your mind then that changes the man I thought you were irreconcilably.\"", "NTA, I was the adopted differently colored kid at family gathering for years. Why I didn't hear the comments often I did hear them, and the people who would say those comments kids would start to say other things to me because they heard it from their parents. I eventually told my mom what was happening and the comments did eventually stop. Family gatherings became really bittersweet and I really don't keep in touch with many of them now that I'm an adult.", "I can't help but think that on some level, the husband is on the same wavelength as his parents....as in the boy is not his \"real\" child so its okay.", "Honestly, mom is also the AH for not seeing this coming and preparing for it or stopping it sooner. There is a big problem with usually yt folks who think tranracial and transnational adoption are no big deal, but there are huge communities of adopted children who have grown up and talk about how they have suffered. Mom better start listening to those communities ASAP and learn more about how to support their adopted child including seeking out experiences for him to not be the only person who looks like him in the room.", "NTA, that\u2019s completely over the line.", "Okay we're going to need an updated on the convo with your husband after he hears what's been said when you were not there.", "Why is your husband defending racists? NTA", "NTA. You need to let your husband know about the level of abuse he's suffering from. If your husband still thinks your over-reacting, you might need to separate your child from him too, as he would still drag that poor child over to his parents house.", "NTA protect your baby", "NTA, your husband a behavior moving forward will be very telling!!", "NTA.", "NTA: You are a wonderful parent. And I would be proud to have you for a friend. And your son is blessed to have you for a mom. Great job.", "Nta. This kind of thing is the reason my kids aren\u2019t allowed alone with my mother. I don\u2019t know what kind of bullshit will come out of her mouth.", "NTA, you did right,  and you should never communicate with that part of the family again. Your good parents, keep your kid away from those vile people.", "NTA, sooo NTA. You hubby is pushing on TA, and if he doesn't fully endorse, support, and help you remove contact with his parents, sounds like you have some serious thinking to do. His parents are toxic, hateful AHs. They should be excised from your life with prejudice. What they've done is unforgivable. Seriously, if hubby can't let go of that level of toxic hate, you may need a different arrangement.", "NTA!!!!  Omg this is absolutely horrifying!  He\u2019s a KID!  So what if he\u2019s adopted and/has a different shade ok skin, HE IS STILL A KID!  Who even CARES if someone is adopted, YOU chose him, YOU are his mum, that IS REAL, and your husband and his shitty family should be ASHAMED, horribly ashamed. Not only were they being racist, but they were bullying a KID. I would be MORTIFIED if my family behaved like that.", "NTA", "NTA. Good parenting there, Mama Bear.", "Why is your son's skin a different colour? Because he's adopted... fine.\n\nThe bigger question, and one that you should have asked, is \"why are his grandparents such raging AHs.. and bigots?  Why are they incapable of behaving like decent people?\"  And then leave.  \n\nYou are NTA.  Keep protecting your son from these utterly contemptable people. I hope your husband changes his mind after hearing the other things his parents say.", "Wait, step-grandparents? Has your husband adopted your son as well? \n\nHonestly, the whole lot of them can go straight to hell for being so cruel to a child. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA but please do not allow those people around your child again.", "NTA and lmfao if your husband was gonna \u201chandle it\u201d he would have already done that", "I agree, my vote would be ESH (except the kid). OP writes that is has happened on more than one occasion and yet they still keep bringing this poor kid around those gross people??", "Top kek, mom is not AH here, she's NTA."]}
