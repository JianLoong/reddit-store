Just do what Mary does and when she complains tell you that you're following her example.", "NTA, here\u2019s an approach you can take. With all your roommates around, ask Mary why the rule is specifically for partners. It\u2019s not about noise because a bunch of friends are just as noisy. If it\u2019s about sex, then the rule should just be about sex. \n\nSo either the rule gets limited to no sex with partners or the rule gets broadened to no friends without permission. That\u2019s the ultimatum. \n\nIf she disagrees with both, I would just outright ask if she has a problem because you\u2019re gay.

Unless this is some kind of campus housing that had laid out rules about how late guests can be there (doubtful since this would be critical to the story and I've only heard of this at strict religious universities).

So, it's not a rule. Period. Full stop.\n\nI mean, you can say \"I have a new rule, at the beginning of every day, each roommate must give me $100\". Nobody is going to agree to it, nor should you expect the money... because they haven't agreed to it.\n\nI still find it weird that you'd agree to the rule in the first place (even excluding the fact that you didn't formally agree to it / sign).", "My dorm experience is already almost two decades behind, but we had to sign agreements then. Basic consideration things like don\u2019t steal, keep it clean together, overnight guests must be agreed on since we shared the same bedroom. There was an option to add custom things with examples - like peanut free room if there\u2019s an allergy. Cutoff times for male guests in a room with someone who covers their hair for religious reasons, etc. I don\u2019t think it was called a roommate agreement - more like a code of acceptable conduct and it was overseen by housing.", "Tell her you do not consent to her having people over in the evenings anymore. Period. And if she continues to do so without your permission, then she has voided the roommate agreement and you can do what you want.", "Just tell her you broke up and gf is now simply a friend. Problem solved.", "Stop being Mary's doormat. Stick up for yourself!", "You should tell her your school will not accept that rule, it is actually discriminatory if they allow it because they can have members of the lgbtq+ community, or of different races being discriminated against. You have to have an RA or RD for your floor or building I would tell them about the bias going on and ask if there is anyway they can help you resolve this or have a conversation. Believe me your school would not approve or want their name on this unless its BYU or a catholic u.", "Having a bi best friend doesn't mean she cannot be homophobic.\n\n\"I am not racist, my cousin married a black man.\" /s", "You keep saying 'she set this rule.'  Why are you giving her authority over you?", "Why can she unilaterally declare house rules? Or why did you agree to such a ridiculous rule? Whatever, time for a change.", "Are you bi? Mary might be okay with a bi friend because maybe she personally believes that friend is going through a phase. Or maybe she's known this friend long enough/cared about them enough prior to finding out that they're bi that she's willing to \"overlook\" this part of them. Maybe she wouldn't be okay if she was living with that friend and they asked to have a partner of the same gender stay over. \n\nJust personally speaking as a bi person myself that a lot of times people say they're okay with us but they're actually not/they use us to \"prove\" they're not homophobic because they think bi people are close enough to straight people. I definitely know people who are \"friends\" with bi people but are bigoted toward other queer people. \n\nDoes anyone else have a significant other? And has Mary ever allowed anyone else's SO to visit after dark?", "OP, you need to grow a backbone. This is all fucking ridiculous.", "Yeah then she really has no say in what you do in the space you rent if it is not something in the lease. She just sounds awful to be honest", "Many bigots make exceptions, and then don't consider themselves bigoted.  Think, \"but I have a black friend!\".  She's a homophobe.  Stop asking and instead send a heads up text- girlfriend is coming over for a movie tomorrow night. She'll be here past sundown\".  That way, you've given a courtesy but you're an adult, so you're not asking permission.", "i\u2019m a lesbian, and mary\u2019s best friend is allowed to have her boyfriend over, although he almost never stops by.", "Everyone is saying she's homophobic; but I think she's trying to not be hypocritical and give the gay special rules.\n\nI'm going to assume the house rules were made before people were even aware of orientations because this makes more sense in a timeline where you're meeting new roommates.\n\nNext, they have been fed a steady diet of every dude is out to rape you on campas, so the rules were made so everyone was aware of who would be in the house and when.  And even without being fed the diet of rape statistics, seems like a good idea, not so much getting permission but at least letting others know someone is here.\n\nSo they all made up this rule to ease their men/rape concerns but now one of them is a lesbian so their partner will be a girl; but now if you let her come over and bypass the rules others will now want to.\n\nJust yelling homophobe only really seems to make sense if you don't want to think about it.", "I agree on the phobia bit, but Mary is following all the rules from what I can see. \n\nThe rule was **friends** can be over any time of the day, but **partners** need permission past sundown. \n\nNo mention of Mary having a girlfriend/boyfriend, so she just gets to do whatever she wants while contemptuously looking down her nose at people who do.", "I initially thought the same but after reading OPs comments about Mary\u2019s best friend and the theater group\u2019s numerous LGBTQ+ members it made me rethink.", "Homophonic hehehe", "That\u2019s exactly what I think the problem is here.", "Please do not put your gf in the position of confronting your roommate bc you won\u2019t. As many others have said, Mary is not the boss of you. She has her friends over all the time and yet you cannot have your gf over ever. Tell Mary that you are no longer following her rules. What\u2019s she gonna do about it? Stand up for yourself- be respectful about it and don\u2019t back down. Also, don\u2019t let them continue to use your streaming apps. They can get their own.", "It's on you to address this with Mary, not your GF.", "*She is currently in a relationship with a man*\n\nAh yes, this is exactly what I expected when you said her best friend is bi. It\u2019s very likely that Mary is homophobic, and her best friend is the exception\u2014likely because she\u2019s dating a guy. The story might change if she ever dates girl. \n\nNew house rule: everyone has to ask before using anything you own or pay for, and then you always say yes to the others and no to Mary. Is it petty? Absolutely but it makes for a great illustration of how she treats you. Alternatively just stop listening to her rule and have your girlfriend over. If she refuses to be reasonable she doesn\u2019t get the courtesy of being asked.", "NTA. Is something missing from this? So...you have to ask permission for guests but Mary does not? Just do what Mary does and when she complains tell you that you're following her example.", "When she says that \"mary has people over almost every night\" I took that to mean past sundown...hence, she's not following the rules.", "Not really. Implicit in an agreement like this is that all parties would act reasonably and not unjustifiably withhold permission. The fact Mary has turned this into a de facto ban is a modification of the initial deal that no one agreed too.", "The past sundown clause only affects romantic partners from my understanding."]}
