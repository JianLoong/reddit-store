At this point, I wonder if it\u2019s homophobia.", "NTA.  Is something missing from this?  So...you have to ask permission for guests but Mary does not?  Just do what Mary does and when she complains tell you that you're following her example.", "NTA, here\u2019s an approach you can take. With all your roommates around, ask Mary why the rule is specifically for partners. It\u2019s not about noise because a bunch of friends are just as noisy. If it\u2019s about sex, then the rule should just be about sex. \n\nSo either the rule gets limited to no sex with partners or the rule gets broadened to no friends without permission. That\u2019s the ultimatum. \n\nIf she disagrees with both, I would just outright ask if she has a problem because you\u2019re gay.

Unless this is some kind of campus housing that had laid out rules about how late guests can be there (doubtful since this would be critical to the story and I've only heard of this at strict religious universities).
