A decade, maybe. \n\nRecently (in the last year or so) she found god and has gotten in with the local church. And I\u2019m happy for her - she seems to be having a good time and she\u2019s happy. All cool. \n\nExcept every time I see her now, she tells me that I need to find Jesus, read the bible, that my lifestyle is going to lead me to an early grave and that there will be nothing waiting for me beyond that. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 frustrating. \n\nFor a start, my lifestyle is just fine. I don\u2019t drink often, I don\u2019t smoke\u2026 I\u2019m just not religious.

We were sitting in the garden (it\u2019s hot rn) and we\u2019d been chatting about her upcoming birthday. She told me that if I wasn\u2019t willing to even try to find Jesus in my heart, I couldn\u2019t go. \n\nOkay, cool, have a great time? I wasn\u2019t really sure what to say. When I told her that if that\u2019s what she wanted, then I hope she has a great party, she got really mad at me and started quoting the bible at me. \n\nI asked her to please just stop trying to push her religion at me - that it\u2019s not cool to do that to anyone, and how would she like it if I started bad mouthing her religion every time I saw her. \n\n(I wouldn\u2019t, but I think it\u2019s a legitimate point.) \n\nShe devolved into name calling and telling me that I would be going to hell, so I told her to leave. \n\nMy sister-in-law later told me that I should have just told her I\u2019d try to find Jesus, and that people can be touchy about religion and I shouldn\u2019t have told her to stop pushing it on me. \n\nSo now I\u2019m not sure.

Have to have boundaries. On the other hand, your sister is partially right that people's attachment to religion is sometimes all that separates them from a dysfunctional life. You're clearly compassionate about that. There is just no need for you to put up with the verbal abuse.", "NTA,  but as an ex religious people, I think people who have never been religious misunderstand when religious people try to share their religion. She truly believes with all her heart that if you don't believe in Jesus, you will have an eternity of suffering. Therefore, she will do everything in her power to prevent that from happening. Penn Jillette had a good metaphor for it. It's as if she sees a train coming and your standing on the tracks, but you don't see the train and don't believe that it's going to hit you. She'll ask you to get off the tracks, but you say no, I don't believe there is a train. At some point, if she truly cares about you, she's gonna push you off the tracks so the train that she thinks she sees won't hit you.", "NTA, sounds like she\u2019s been sucked into a Bible-thumping cult. Also, new believers are also the most zealous.", "**NTA** \\- The newly found often go through an evangelical phase.", "Definitely NTA. That\u2019s great she found god but that\u2019s no excuse for you to condescendingly speak down to you about it. It\u2019s foolish she would tell you you\u2019re going to hell/there will be nothing in the afterlife for you.", "NTA. Those people are some of the actual worst. So obnoxious.", "NTA.  People are touchy about religion.  That's why she should have stopped trying to force it on you.", "Ah, the ego of the newly converted. You're worldly so it's her job to convert you. She'll eventually give up and cut you out of her life cause you're a bad influence.\n\nAs shitty as it'll feel, you might as well cut your losses and move on now. \n\nNTA\n\nWas she having a hard time before she joined? Some churches prey on those that feel a lack of control following a difficult time in their life.", "NTA! You are very gracious to acknowledge that your friend is very zealous at the moment, and to try to be forgiving. I am a Christian myself, and it grieves me when I hear stories like this. If you want to stay friends with her you should ask her what the appeal is for HER, what was it that made HER decide SHE wanted to have a relationship with GOD? Ask her if it was the idea that she might go to hell or if she wanted to get close to God because he thought she was a bad person. Because that is how she is making you feel, and if she is an ambassador for Jesus, SHE is making YOU (and anyone else she is talking to like she's talking to you) not want any by being so JUDGMENTAL. If she believes Jesus loved her right where she was, acting no different than you, why can't she love you right where you are? Why is she only going to act loving if you do what she wants? She should be loving no matter whether you and her have the same lifestyle anymore or not, and quite honestly the \"love\" she is showing you is no love at all. She will probably get very angry, but she will walk away and think about it and become kind of ashamed. The point is not to shame her, but to point out to her that nowhere in the Bible does Jesus talk to people like she is talking to you, it is a huge anti-advertisement. If she really does think she has something great she should share her joy and not her judgment.", "NTA ! Your friend is, by the way.. is great that she found Jesus but she is not right to push her beliefs into other people and giving ultimatums.", "NTA", "NTA.  I'm 100% with you in that I honor and am happy for all my religious friends if that is what works for them.  However, I am not at all interested in joining any church and I have my personal reasons for this that I do not feel compelled to foist on anyone.  Your friend \"requiring\" you to be of like mind is taking her fervor a step too far.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  She backed you into a corner and left you no option but the one you took.  No way should you have lied to her or pretended to be something or someone you are not.  Your SIL is dead wrong on this one.\n\nSometimes people get into things we can't embrace and it does change our relationships going forward.  Looks like this is what is happening here.  The fact that your longtime friend would get so upset with you and even stoop to not being very nice is surprising and not okay.  It is what it is, I guess, and it's not for you.  That's totally okay.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s entitled to her beliefs & you\u2019re entitled to yours. They don\u2019t have to align by any means.

Sort of means, you do you and all good, but not once it affects me.\n\nShe is free to profess her love to whatever God she likes, and worship how she likes. She is not free to impugn on you to follow suit. Don\u2019t you dare stop sticking up for yourself!\n\nNTA", "NTA, and she is NOT your friend.  Maybe she was, but not anymore.  I don't have many friends myself, but I do know, friends accept you \"just as you are\".", "Tell her a missionary told you that it\u2019s up to God to convert people in God\u2019s time and in God\u2019s way. Her ego is getting in the way of God\u2019s work. \n\nNTA, if you told her that you try to find Jesus, she will be over everyday to do Bible study with you I like my weekly Bible study but don\u2019t believe in hitting people over the head with the Bible.", "Absolutely NTA. \nI say this as someone who grew up in the church and was super devoted until adulthood. Your friend is completely brainwashed (and is the actual AH). Even as a Christian, I knew that it was wrong to push my beliefs onto others. I always took the stance of \u201cwho am I to judge someone else when I\u2019m not perfect either\u201d \nYour friend is way too sucked into religion, and will likely be pushing away more valuable people in her life from acting that way. Which is ironic because Jesus spent a lot of his time hanging out with the non-religious folks. But I digress. \n\nLive and let live, like you said. But I wouldn\u2019t bother trying to be friends with someone like that.", "NTA - What else were you supposed to do? You aren't required to follow her religion just because she \"found Jesus.\" The thing about Jesus (mind you, I'm Buddhist, so I might be a little off) is that he teaches his followers to be accepting of everyone.", "NTA. Sorry, it sounds like you've lost a friend. I'm Christian and am dating a person who doesn't like or believe in religion. I couldn't imagine trying to push my beliefs on him. He'd just end up leaving because that's annoying.", "Christian here and you are definitely NTA. \n\nOne thing that you could mention to her that might get through is that God gave people freedom of choice and does not force people to serve him, nor does he want worshippers that only follow him for the sake of \u201cnot burning in hell.\u201d  Ask her if God has given you the freedom of choice, why isn\u2019t she giving you that same right?\n\nAlso, her resorting to name calling and telling you you\u2019re going to burn in hell is not Christlike. You can tell her that too.\n\nYou\u2019ve respected her choices, the least she can do is respect yours even if she doesn\u2019t agree with them.", "NTA: time to find new force who need to accept your beliefs and not force something on you. Lol when i was reading this it\u2019s remind me of my dad", "I\u2019ve had to tell my parents to stop. They converted to a different religion after I grew up.\n\nIt\u2019s hard.", "NTA  Sounds like she has dived into this church head first. This really feels like it's going to lead to a point of you snapping on her, so you might just do best to walk away now.", "OP it's time for your own \"come to Jesus\" moment and realize that you two are going in different directions like a lot of friendships do.  She's not changing her mission, which is to get you and likely everyone else she knows and meets into her religious indoctrination drive (just like what we gay people have been trying to do all of these years) .  It happens, for whatever reason, and you may never know why she's changed this way.  You're not going to change her outlook, she's not going to change your outlook, so you just need to slowly move away from the situation to save yourself from further heartbreak.  It's never easy giving up long-term friendships, but nothing lasts forever sadly.", "NTA. Not even remotely.\n\nChristian here. I apologize on her behalf that your friend is acting this way. Any telling someone they can't spend time with you because you don't share their beliefs-- that aren't harming anyone, mind you, AND you've set clear boundaries on before-- is just ridiculous. She is not your friend.\n\nThis is, indeed, pushing religion on someone. You deserve to have your boundaries respected. I hope this helps.", "NTA and I think it's time to find a new friend.

These people are hard to be around", "NTA religion is nonsense and should not be forced upon anyone if someone wants to believe in a man in the sky they can but they do not get to demand others do the same nor do they get to demand they follow their arbitrary rules", "NTA\n\nIs she in a cult? Or did sth impactful happen? She sounds unhinged tbh", "Honestly... if you'd told her that you'd try to find Jesus on your own, like your SiL suggested... your friend wouldn't stop.  If anything, she'd probably try even harder because then she'd know that she was getting through to you, and with a little more pushing, you'd convert to Christianity and your soul would be saved.  Pretending would not help.  Not pretending to consider converting. Not pretending to be converted.  \n\nI know whereof I speak here... my family were born again Christians when I was young, and exhibited the same zeal that your friend has.  It took a LONG time for my parents to finally accept that I was not going to convert... but there was a time that I did start going to church on my own, to see if (just maybe) there was something in it that would work for me.  That was about the time (I suspect it was not a coincidence... /s) that they grew much more enthusiastic about having me in their lives again.  Taking me to church. Getting me to participate in Christian groups. etc. etc. etc.  This phase where I tried out church didn't last very long (a few years) and ended when I realized that I simply didn't believe any of it.\n\nMy parents were disappointed, to say the least, and kept trying for years to get me to change my mind... but how am I supposed to give their religion a try again, when I can't actually believe that the most important aspects of it are real? I said as much.  they kept trying though. \n\nYour friend is not going to stop. She'll do whatever it takes to get you to change your mind. In her mind, you are wrong, sinful, and condemned to an eternity of torment (in H E double hockeysticks) and she has taken it upon herself to save you... whether you want to be saved or not. Whether or not you even believe any of it.  Because... again... you're wrong.  And you need to be saved. NTA but the friendship is going to be... difficult to maintain. Unless your friend moderates her views and accepts that you are not going to change (won't be anytime soon) or you convert (ditto.)", "NTA.  Let me be the one bursting your bubble. Your friendship is over. You will be sad for a wile, and mourn your friend and her friendship. And then you will move on and find new friends.  Let me explain you why. There are two kinds of people who find their religion. The not fanatics and the fanatics. The not fanatics just found a new beleive sistem that makes them happy, and will cassually bring it up to everybody. But at the end, will respect everybody's choices. Now, the fanatics, will try to force their new found feith in everyone near them. And they strongly beleive that if the people arround do not \"convert\" and joy in, then they are \"Satanas followers\" and are their \"enemys\". So my dear girl, let me be the first to tell you, I am sorry for your lost. RIP your friendship. Hugs.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t like it if you started pushing Islam/Buddhism/Satanism/etc at her.\n\nIt\u2019s comical that she would force her religion as a requirement to go to her party, but then gets mad when you refuse. Hopefully it\u2019s a phase for her, but if not, you may need to reevaluate the friendship.", "NTA. One of my best friends is evangelical. Once every two or three years he reminds me that if I ever want to embrace Christianity, he'd love to talk about that and then we play video games and let it be. She's not a friend, she's in a spiritual MLM. You don't have to buy the soap", "Just like recent non-smokers and newly clean alcoholics, new baby christians are some of the most annoying and obnoxious people on earth. Hopefully she\u2019ll outgrow the judgmental attitude and learn about grace and mercy.\n\nNTA", "Another Christian here and I second this!", "This made me laugh, not gonna lie.", "That sucks. Do you still work closely with her?", "Christian here too and from my own experience, I got really \"passionate\" when I re-dedicated my life that I lost friends. I've heard this can happen to a lot of young Christians, young being new. I admit, I was pretty judgmental then (early 20s) and regret my behavior, but I still talk about my beliefs when people ask and have cordial conversations with people, or try to.\n\nI will never tell a friend she can't come to my birthday because she's not a Christian. Getting into biblical talk here: Jesus word spread so fast because he hung out with everyone and people asked about Him. He would be preaching to a crowd and more would join. He wouldn't stop someone from hanging with Him just because they didn't believe.", "Op there is a sermon Jeus gave in, I want to say Matthew, about how people who pray loudly and in public are sinning against God because they've turned their acts of devotion into acts of self gratification by showing the rest of the world how pious they are. The passages talk about how you are to pray in private behind closed doors because it is a holy act between you and God not something to be put on display.\n\nIf you really want to know more to quote back at your friend I can look it up for you. I'm not a Christian but I was raised pentacostal.", "That might be a very good idea. You are a good friend to try to work this out, she will probably get more laid back and you won't be sorry that you stopped her from blowing up this relationship. It sounds like you can afford to be generous.\u2764", "Thank you \ud83e\udd17", "Those are all really good points. You've got observations of behavior, and you've placed yourself in her shoes. You understand that faith helps her, and you don't mind, but you've got the important distinction of framing. (Very important in standing up for yourself). \n\nThere's something called the Situation-Behavior-Impact method that helps provide feedback to people. There's a fourth pillar that you can add after, Intent: essentially asking what she was hoping to accomplish with her action. There's this article on it that I've used to give feedback to coworkers and such. I hope it's helpful. [Situation-Behavior-Impact](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-vs-impact-sbii/)", "I'll take that advice on the hard conversations. Thank you.\n\nThat said, I don't know very many in my community who are like OP's friend, but I'll keep an eye out."]}
