Some have suggested that you still invite him to the wedding, but downgrade him from being a groomsman - perhaps this is a good compromise, but I personally don\u2019t think I would want him there on my big day... I understand that he was intoxicated when saying this stuff, but will there be alcohol served at your reception? If so, then wouldn\u2019t it be likely that he would say the same or do worse? Not to mention that he might be trying to \u201cmake a move\u201d on a female who was drinking\u2026 super gross. I would let your brother\u2019s girlfriend know what was said, either way. This is predatory behaviour and she needs to be prepared If she ever runs into him in the future. As for the drama it would cause in uninviting him, in my mind, I\u2019d rather have drama before my wedding day, and have a drama-free big day.  I guess it depends on how close you and your hubby are to this person.

One little stupid comment when he is drunk at the wedding could easily ruin the night for her brother and his girlfriend.

Hopefully that means he'll be receptive if you did decide you want a conversation with Dan", "I'd for sure bring it up to her. You may find out Dan has done or said some creepy shit to her in the past.

You don't need to dredge up a past your brother may or may not be familiar with. Could be totally fine, could be uncomfortable for one or both of them. I'd just let her make that call.\n\nAlso, your husband may want to let Dan know that if there is even a hint that he is being weird about this at the wedding, he is out in the curb.\n\nPersonally, I really doubt Dan is gonna be able to make it through the entire wedding without saying something. He's gonna make a little comment about their past in front of your brother, and it's gonna fuck up your brother's night. I suspect your husband knows this too, but doesn't want to do the very uncomfortable task of telling Dan he is out, so he is pretending it won't be an issue.\n\nFortunately, it's kinda fun to be the person tasked with running interference at the wedding.

I think it's critical to her safety to let her know what his plan is, regardless of whether he goes to your wedding. I would feel a moral imperative to avoid allowing him around any women I know while they or he are drinking, and to warn folks about him.

But honestly, Dan's even laid out a specific plan with a specific date and location--and it is a plan to make a move on her \\_while she is drunk\\_ . I think you and your husband need to take this as a real threat. I've run events where speakers had stalkers. Usually only slightly elevated security is necessary. But when a stalker has actually named an event of mine--a specific named date and location--as one they'll show up at, police and security take it \\_extremely\\_ seriously (and in my experience, the stalker shows up).
