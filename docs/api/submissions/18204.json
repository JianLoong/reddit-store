But basically he was saying how he's going to use my wedding (which girlfriend will be at) as a chance to make his move, everyone will be drinking, etc and my husband was saying nah man don't say that and that's messed up bro and you need to back off and stuff so I walked towards them when my husband was getting kind of loud and then eavesdropped and thats how i heard. \n\nSo now I'm saying to my husband wtf and Dan needs to not be invited to the wedding and certainly not be a groomsmen. But my husband is saying your overreacting and I said has he said that stuff before sober and my husband confirmed never like that but he's made it pretty clear he's still into her. \n\nSo now my husband is saying we can't kick him out of the wedding but he'll talk to him and make it clear he needs to not be saying that stuff and I'm saying no hes out and my husband is saying he sees where I'm coming from but he doesn't want the drama and we need to think about it \n\nAita", "created_utc": 1685084215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13s5sxb/aita_for_wanting_to_uninvited_husbands_groomsman/", "score": 536, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One little stupid comment when he is drunk at the wedding could easily ruin the night for her brother and his girlfriend.

I'd just let her make that call.\n\nAlso, your husband may want to let Dan know that if there is even a hint that he is being weird about this at the wedding, he is out in the curb.\n\nPersonally, I really doubt Dan is gonna be able to make it through the entire wedding without saying something. He's gonna make a little comment about their past in front of your brother, and it's gonna fuck up your brother's night.

I would feel a moral imperative to avoid allowing him around any women I know while they or he are drinking, and to warn folks about him.

But honestly, Dan's even laid out a specific plan with a specific date and location--and it is a plan to make a move on her \\_while she is drunk\\_ . I think you and your husband need to take this as a real threat. I've run events where speakers had stalkers. Usually only slightly elevated security is necessary. But when a stalker has actually named an event of mine--a specific named date and location--as one they'll show up at, police and security take it \\_extremely\\_ seriously (and in my experience, the stalker shows up).
