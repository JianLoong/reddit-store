But basically he was saying how he's going to use my wedding (which girlfriend will be at) as a chance to make his move, everyone will be drinking, etc and my husband was saying nah man don't say that and that's messed up bro and you need to back off and stuff so I walked towards them when my husband was getting kind of loud and then eavesdropped and thats how i heard. \n\nSo now I'm saying to my husband wtf and Dan needs to not be invited to the wedding and certainly not be a groomsmen. But my husband is saying your overreacting and I said has he said that stuff before sober and my husband confirmed never like that but he's made it pretty clear he's still into her. \n\nSo now my husband is saying we can't kick him out of the wedding but he'll talk to him and make it clear he needs to not be saying that stuff and I'm saying no hes out and my husband is saying he sees where I'm coming from but he doesn't want the drama and we need to think about it \n\nAita", "created_utc": 1685084215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13s5sxb/aita_for_wanting_to_uninvited_husbands_groomsman/", "score": 1056, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's gonna make a little comment about their past in front of your brother, and it's gonna fuck up your brother's night.

But honestly, Dan's even laid out a specific plan with a specific date and location--and it is a plan to make a move on her \\_while she is drunk\\_ . I think you and your husband need to take this as a real threat. I've run events where speakers had stalkers. Usually only slightly elevated security is necessary. But when a stalker has actually named an event of mine--a specific named date and location--as one they'll show up at, police and security take it \\_extremely\\_ seriously (and in my experience, the stalker shows up).

My cousin got married and his bff was the groomsman. I was invited and took Kay as a plus one. My cousins best friend kept hitting on her all night, she denied many times. Of course it was a wedding and we got sloshed, I went to use the bathroom and couldn\u2019t find Kay when I came back. I kept calling her and walking around, I heard her phone by chance over the music and it was coming from the coat closet. Opened the door and I was ready to murder, Kay was drunk and passed out being raped by my cousins friend. I was away/looking for her 10-15 mins and that\u2019s all the time it took to happen. I don\u2019t want to go into detail but to this day I always blame myself for taking her as my plus one.
