They are things that grown-ups say sometimes because it makes them feel better, but kids can get in trouble when they say them.  \n  \nI feel like that's a better strategy.  It doesn't make them a taboo, something \"bad\" for kids to use in private for thrills, just something that they know they might get in trouble for if they use now, but can use when they are older.  She's heard many of them but never used one, so I think it's working.  \n  \nNTA Tell your son that he might get in trouble if he uses some of those words and he is overheard by you or his mom, or a teacher, or even a parent of one of his friends.  And that the punishment for using some of the words is for using them as a kid and getting caught.  Also clarify that there are some words for which the punishment is for using them at all, for even having them in his vocabulary, assuming you consider some bad enough to warrant that.  \n  \nThat way, it's not that you are hypocrites, it's that the words are appropriate to use at some ages and situations but not others.", "NTA Your wife has to stop trying to keep him a little boy. She cannot continue to treat him like an eight year old, he needs to have room to grow and form his own identity among his peers.

Your wife is a hypocrite because your son learned how to curse from both of you during your every day activities, most likely while still a very small child. He just hasn't exercised it socially til more recently.", "Worrying about a 16 year old cursing with their friends is silly. At the same time, you don't want your son to develop verbal habits where only one strong adjective is used and the rest of the dictionary is bypassed.\n\nNAH both you and your wife have valid positions, but the deep reason for my judgement is that whatever you and your wife decide, it won't change a thing. Your son is at that age where what the parents loose control over things like how they talk.

Come to a conclusion that you are both ok with, and stick to it.", "YTA for teaching your kid to sneak around your wife\u2019s back.

Wife's point may be that you don't want him to think of cursing as something to use every day in normal conversations. \n\nMaybe raise your child in a way that will encourage life success. Using curse words on a routine basis will not make your son respected. It's a bad habit if that's what he's learning. Maybe you/spouse could model for him when/where such words are appropriate. Habits are hard to break once well-established.", "YTA for so many reasons.", "Not going to vote because I'm in the minority who would agree with your wife and I find cursing disrespectful in almost any context; just because you're among peers doesn't mean they like hearing it, but it's a bit awkward to say something about it if you feel that way. Granted, cursing (especially when it's done a lot at once or angrily) is also an anxiety trigger for me, hence why I still feel this way as an adult so my reasoning's a bit different from most.\n\nHowever, if you and/or your wife don't want him cursing when you both liberally do it yourselves, then yes, it's hypocritical. If your wife believes cursing is disrespectful in any context, then she shouldn't be doing it in any context.", "YTA. Dont complain if hes rude, belligerent, or anything of the like.

It's useful for a person to be able to kind of get that swearing out of their system when they're younger so long as it's being done in a way that isn't derogatory, allows them to be more mature when they get older I think and understand that swearing doesn't really add anything intelligent to conversation most of the time. Swearing is also way better than the alternative for venting pain/frustration, sometimes you find that people who don't really ever swear turn to venting by physical altercations, which I think is way worse than throwing out some shit fuck god damns every now and again.\n\nEdit to add NTA forgot the most important part of the thread lol", "Hubby and I \u201callowed\u201d our kids to curse in front of us from Jr High on told them no other adults that it was disrespectful, but at home with us was acceptable, even allowed their friends too.
