This man has a million red flags and is clearly trying to ensure all family and friends shut her out and stop contact - a clear sign of an abuser. They stop contact with everyone so that she's stuck in the relationship and has no one else to turn to. IMO I would apologise and say you are always here for her no matter what because ultimately that could be her lifeline.", "YTA. She's not okay, as you know she's in a very unhealthy relationship, and she's just a kid, but legally an adult so there's nothing you can do about that EXCEPT REFUSE TO ALLOW HIM TO ISOLATE HER!!!! Don't help that bastard. Be there for her even if you don't like her choice. It's going to end, but she won't have anywhere to turn. DO NOT HELP HIM ISOLATE HER.

I remember being a mature 19 year old dating a 35 year old and looking back now, I know I was a fool! I dumped thue looser because I came to my senses and listened to dad.\nDon't give your daughter ultimatums if you want her back in your life. You want her to come to you when she's hurting, not swallow har pain/shame because \"who will have my back or want me if even my parents don't!\"\n\nBe the shelter from the storm, the guiding voice.

If this is an abusive situation? Then you're threatening to cut the safe people out of her life. Mission accomplished for him. If its a young woman being completely wrapped up in herself & her relationship? Then you're cutting your nose off to spite your face. I completely understand wanting her to be more considerate but cutting her out of your life, which is what you'll be doing because she's in love & not going to leave him, seems extreme. Edit for spelling mistake.", "YTA. What are you hoping to achieve with this behaviour of yours? I get it that you don't like the dude. You probably think he is too old for her, and he probably is. He is buying her affections, well it certainly looks that way. But the fact remains that your daughter is not a minor any more, and by making her choose between you, you are just pushing her further away. So much so that she very likely will not feel that she could turn to you, if her relationship should turn sour in the future. Is that what you want?", "YTA. If you are giving an ultimatum, it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed you\u2019re the AH. (Ultimatums and boundaries are different, btw, and boundaries is not what you did).\n\nIf you really believe he\u2019s abusive, you need to support your daughter, not abandon her. If the time comes where she wants to leave him and can\u2019t rely on you for support because you tried to strongarm her into doing what you wanted earlier, she\u2019s lost what could be a very valuable part of her support system. Love her, be patient, and be there if things fall apart.", "YTA- even if he is abusive, your actions are just pushing her further into this relationship and that\u2019s if we can trust your side of the story. As far as I can tell she\u2019s not spending enough time (by your measure) with you and that\u2019s enough to claim he\u2019s abusive. You don\u2019t need ultimatums you\u2019ve already pushed her away. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t help but think she entered a relationship with a much older man, for his ability to get her away from you.", "Soft YTA, as a domestic abuse advocate this is always the starting point for may survivors, she has met this older man who is giving her everything she asks for, she is young , just an adult and he has come in with security of not having to worry about money. He has isolated her from her family and probably her friends once he has successfully done this and married her, this is where it can deteriorate quickly for her. \n\nYou giving her ultimatums pushes her to him, my advice like others have said is let her know that you\u2019re there for her, voice your concerns but leave jt there, otherwise she may be pushed away too far. \n\nThere is a reason no women closer to his age want him, and a reason he goes for younger women. The younger you are with less life experience the easier you are to manipulate and have rose tinted glasses on till it\u2019s too late", "NTA, but this is exactly the wrong way to handle this. He's manipulating her, isolating her, and that ultimatum plays right into his hands. Tell her you'll be there for her, let her know she can always come to you, otherwise she'll stay because she'll believe she has no other place to go when the relationship turns bad.", "WTH does it mean to \"choose\"? Does that mean if she decides to stay with her fiance then she is no longer welcome to her family?\n\nI would never tell my daughter (or son) that for that will push her away.  You are metaphorically kicking her out of your home.  I view a parent's role is to provide that sense of safety and security for all in the family especially for our children.\n\nI think that if we kick out our children every time they behave like asshats then they would never live with us at all.", "YTA.  If you're worried that she's being manipulated by this man, but consider that _this is exactly part of his manipulation_.  You're not an asshole for being concerned, but you desperately need to accept that she, as a legal adult, is being manipulated.  Yes, you and me and most people see it, but she doesn't, and hopefully one day she will.  When that happens, do you want his manipulation to be _so_ complete that she can't get out?", "YTA \n\nYou mean well, but the execution will just push her further into the arms of that pervert.\n\nStay in touch with her. Make sure she knows she can always come back home to you and that you love her and will be there for her.", "YTA. Either it's completely innocent relationship and your daughters priority has shift from you her parents to her spouse (which is part of growing up) or he really is controlling her and is isolating her which is the first stage of abuse. Either way as a parent your priority should be your child and supporting them, either being happy that they are growing up and starting a family of thier own and I you are hurt expressing it softly without ruining thier happiness and respecting them as an adult or being by thier side incase thier partner is bad news and you want them to know they have you as support and always come to you if need an out.", "YTA I understand completely where you were coming from however, it seems from what you stated that he\u2019s completely manipulated her and brainwashed her. There\u2019s nothing you can do at this point. Giving her an ultimatum is only going to push her farther away. You need to keep the lines of communication open. You need to continue to let her know that you are there for her. You cannot push her completely away or you will lose her forever.", "YTA, you should be doing absolutely everything to support her because she's obviously going to need it with a guy like that. If you cut her off now you might never get her back and you won't be able to help her when things eventually go wrong.", "Rough\u2026.giving ultimatums in situations like this rarely goes well. I understand you\u2019re concerned for her, but giving her that ultimatum is just going to give her fianc\u00e9 more fuel for saying \u201clook how ridiculous they\u2019re being\u201d. Pretty much between a rock and a hard place.\n\nI\u2019m saying soft YTA for the ultimatum, not for being concerned for your daughter. I would be concerned too. But I would want to be there for my child if/when this falls apart, and honestly to keep an eye on the relationship. Personally I\u2019m weirded out by that age gap\u2026", "\u2026 no judgment bc the whole thing is sad.\n\nlisten, you literally just told your daughter to leave you forever without any guilty conscience.  i am frankly shocked that you gave her an ultimatum when she has all the leverage.\n\nyou have nothing.", "YTA for how you\u2019re going about this. \n\nThis 36 year old man is into your TEEN daughter, this is unsettling and not normal. All you are doing by giving her an ultimatum is isolating her, making her more vulnerable, and dependent on this man. I don\u2019t really understand how this is \u201cunjust or disrespectful to your parental relationship\u201d ? She\u2019s young, naive, and probably being manipulated by him. You said she\u2019s already cutting contact with other members of her family. This situation should be worrying, not seen as disrespectful. By making her \u201cchoose\u201d you\u2019re just making things worse.\n\nIt\u2019s wrong to punish her for being in a toxic situation.", "YTA, this is not the right way to deal with someone who is being manipulated! If you want her back at some point than you need to show her unconditional love - that is, that she can always come back if she wants to no matter what. By giving her an ultimatum like this she is more likely to be pushed in his direction.", "NTA but she already chose and it's not you! That said he sounds like a predator, she was 18 years old, and he was 35 that's one year off. Did you condome the relationship when it first started? Him pursuing a girl her ahe was the first red flag and this just shouldn't have been allowed to happen.\n\nShe's in trouble even if she doesn't realise, and I don't think you should completely alienate her because she needs to have somewhere to go when she realises his true colours. Don't give him the opportunity to control her by manipulating her into believing he's all she has", "YTA\n\nThis could turn really bad for her. Your description of her fianc\u00e9 and their relationship gives me the heebie jeebies.\n\nIf he\u2019s trying to isolate her, giving her this ultimatum is playing directly into his script. \u201cSee, babe, it\u2019s us against the world!\u201d You need to make it crystal clear to her that if she ever needs you, if she ever needs a safe place to turn, no matter how long it\u2019s been or what\u2019s happened in the meantime, she can always ALWAYS find a safe haven with you and you will always ALWAYS be there for her.", "YTA solely for the ultimatum. this sounds like some sick predator type of stuff, and the fianc\u00e9 definitely seems to be trying to put a hole in your relationship with your daughter. giving her that ultimatum will ultimately push her into his arms, as she probably cannot see how odd his behavior is. she's young, i'm only a year older than her, and i doubt it would be easy for a person her age to notice these signs.\n\nshe'll need your help as the parent in her life to get out of this situation if it truly is as sick as it sounds to me. the ultimatum won't help, and could possibly drive her directly into an even worse scenario without you in it as a result.", "YTA\n \nI can\u2019t tell if this is a real situation or not\u2026 \n \nShe\u2019s 19. A legal adult. And I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s not financially dependent on you. So\u2026 what will be \u201ctolerated\u201d by you is a non-issue. You don\u2019t have a say in her decisions, because you don\u2019t have any leverage here. \n \nYou\u2019re gonna need to do a radical perspective and attitude change. If you are rude to her, if you act cold to her fianc\u00e9, if you are judgmental, or negative about her or him or their relationship, she\u2019s perfectly within her rights to just walk away from you. \n \nYour job as a parent to an *adult* is to be there for them. Is that super hard in this situation given the age gap and the concerns you have? Yes. \n \nBut if the concerns you have turn out to be valid, then sometime in the future she\u2019s gong to *need* you and your support. \n \nYou taking a hard line here is going to push her further away from you, and make it so she won\u2019t feel comfortable turning to you for help if she needs it.", "Oh boy, I\u2019m sorry that was an AH move and you may have lost your daughter. you think he was talking shit about you two before your ultimatum? You just handed him the ammunition to take you and her dad out of the picture forever.", "YTA but let me explain \n\n\nI'm really sorry to hear this\nI have a terrible relationship with parents and giving an ultimatum will only get it worse.\n\nI understand the parenthood thinking behind loosing a child due to unwise life choices like this but you need to her go, let her burn or let her be right. People learn on others mistakes but not everyone, she must fail to learn from it and get up stronger. If she fail, she will be smart enough to come back to you. If she'll make her choices right, she'll also come back, but only if You let her go now.\nI know You see this by a \"young and stupid\" glasses and I see it too by what You describe, but she wants you to be happy for her, which You can't because of her actions.\nSo don't force her to anything... Let her learn in the most human way.\n\n\nAnd by saying all this i have my own exactly the same experience, except i didn't choose a person, but a different life than what parents wanted for me\n\nBest wishes < 3", "YTA\n\nYour response to thinking your daughter is in a (psychologically) abusive relationship is to try and cut her off.\n\nSure you can say if she accepted the ultimatum then she's the one cutting you off, but you knew that's how it would go so its immaterial. Like when someone treats their romantic partner badly because they want to break up, but have the other person do it.\n\nIf you truly believe their relationship is coercive and manipulative why are you trying to create a reality where if you daughter one day realises that and wants to escape, she has no where to go?", "Info: have you been making snide comments to her about her fianc\u00e9?", "YTA - My father didn\u2019t approve my relationship in the first place and he said something similar but he ended up being there for me at my wedding and walking me down the aisle. \n\nYou should not put your daughter in a position to pick one or the other. I understand that parents sometimes do not approve the choices of their kids but you should respect her choices and try to understand the actual problem. \nSit down with her and tell her your feelings, looks like you feel abandoned since she is engaged. Talk it out. \n\nAs a parent you should be there for her, no matter what. It\u2019s your daughter!", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult. You may not like her current life choices, but you have no say in them (despite being her mother). Your ultimatum is unjust, and will only make her retreat to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s arms for comfort.", "Well, considering how resistant you are to idea of her having her own life and how you want to control her choices, it's no wonder if she's found her way into an abusive controlling relationship. That is what you've taught her love looks like. \n\nCongratulations, you've succeeded in creating the perfect controllable puppet and then you lost control of it to a more skilled manipulator.\n\nESH except your daughter, because at this point she can't know better, but all the rest of you should.", "YTA there is absolutely no reason for your behavior. Your ego is getting in the way of your relationship. I understand you\u2019re hurt because she\u2019s pulling away but if you would just let her go through this she will come back around. You need to apologize", "YTA. You decided to cut off your daughter, who you admit is in a vulnerable position, because she chose to not have Thanksgiving with you. Her choosing to not visit you isn't disrespecting your wishes.", "NTA- you should be worried about your daughter because that is a scary age gap, however she\u2019s legally an adult and will live the life she wants. I don\u2019t think the ultimatum is the right move because it just pushes her further away.", "I understand why you\u2019re concerned, but this was a colossally misguided way to handle it. Your daughter is being manipulated by a man twice her age. But she\u2019s still young enough to be naive in the ways of the world. In issuing this ultimatum, you\u2019ve treated her like someone who\u2019s worldly enough to know what she wants and what she\u2019s doing, which she\u2019s not. You\u2019ve basically forced someone who\u2019s clearly not mature enough to make big life decisions to make another big life decision. You\u2019re setting her up for failure. You two need to examine your daughter\u2019s situation, not just her behavior, and act accordingly. You\u2019re too eager to make this about your emotions and it\u2019s left you blind to your daughter\u2019s reality. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She is your daughter, no matter what. Sure, she is distant to you at the moment, might we call it something like \"Love is blind\"?  Have you been at their place lately? It seems like the ball is always in her court when it comes to visiting.\n\nShe is young, she is still discovering life.  She will make mistakes and that is when she needs you most of all. Be there for her.", "YTA, people going to chew me but WTH. although i understand your frustration and pain but the truth is daughter is an adult. you don't have any rights to her life. as a parent you had your 18 years to teach them and guide them.\n\nIn your post you did not explain your daughter fianc\u00e9 character. it seem like you have problem with his age. you did not inform any bad character. do you think your daughters stop responding because you always naggings about her boy friend.'\n\nUltimatum is always ends in resentful. talk to her be support her. if you feel she going to fail be there for her to support.", "So\u2026 she\u2019s being brainwashed and your response is to give her an ultimatum\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s 19. So she\u2019s an adult but just barely and I\u2019ll agree this sounds worrying but - what happens if she picks him? And then realises this is an issue in 5 years time? Will she feel trapped and that she has no choice but to stay because her parents made her chose and she chose and now has no way out?", "YTA and you don\u2019t want them together because you \u201cdon\u2019t like what\u2019s she\u2019s become\u201d.  Perhaps he really loves her? You don\u2019t like he gives her gifts, you don\u2019t like he proposed. You say he\u2019s brainwashed her. I\u2019m afraid you will drive her further into his arms by giving her an ultimatum.  What sort of parent does that?", "Why respect your wishes?  It is clear that you hate her being with him and have made it so miserable that she has decided to distance herself from you both.\n\nYou talk about him buying things for her as manipulative but don't see the hypocrisy of you giving her an ultimatum.\n\nYTA.", "Your daughter is **clearly** in an abusive relationship. Instead of trying to help her, you threaten to abandon her.\n\nAnd then you have the gall to come here and ask if YTA? Yes. Yes, you are. YTA.", "YTA how did you think that would help?\n\nShe already chose him and your ultimatum only removed her ability to come running back to you when he starts beating her.", "YTA  I'm just not buying your explanation for why you don't like him.  She may be distancing herself from you because she picks up vibes that you don't approve of him.  She is old enough to make choices of who she wants to be in a relationship with.  While he might not be your choice for her, you need to be supportive of her right to date the person who makes HER happy.  If you don't, and you draw a line in the sand and make her choose, be prepared to lose.  That isn't a fair ultimatum to give to your daughter.", "YTA at some point you need to step back. Your daughter is a grown ass woman. If it is indeed a bad relationship be there for her when the light bulb comes on.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry she's in a relationship that you disapprove of, but this sort of ultimatum isn't the way to hold on to her; it's the way to drive her away.\n\nIt's not unreasonable to spend Thanksgiving with his family instead of hers, assuming they will alternate. And perhaps your obvious disapproval makes his family more attractive than your own.\n\nIf they're \"hiding out\" at his family's cabin (i.e. not spending Thanksgiving with *either* family, but by themselves), then that's pretty immature, but still fully within their rights; certainly not something worth going *no-contact* over.

I think you probably have to apologize for the ultimatum. That wasn't a good idea. It would only make her cling to her boyfriend more.  She's making a mistake. You know that but you really can't do anything about it. Accept that and learn to live with the new normal.", "Yta....be prepared for her to write about her JNM(justnomom) of the JNMIL(justnomotherinlaw)", "YTA\n\nThe ultimatum will archive the exact opposite of what you want her to do. She needs your support so when she herself came to the conclusion that she needs to leave him, she has you to help her out. Pushing her to break up will just play into his hands.", "So you see signs your daughter is in an abusive relationship and is being manipulated into distancing you, and you... go along with this? Yeah, YTA here. Reach out to your daughter and let her know you're here for her. Don't let him isolate her.", "YTA - because you will lose your daughter and if her fianc\u00e9 is an abuser (mentally, verbally or physically), you just made it that much easier for him.", "YTA. She\u2019s young and there\u2019s a high chance this won\u2019t work with him. Now if things go wrong she won\u2019t feel she can come to either of you. \n\nYou say \u201cthat\u2019s not it\u201d regarding not wanting them to be together. You obviously don\u2019t support the relationship- which is totally understandable given the age gap but you need to be realistic and honest with yourself.", "Your child needs your help !!!!! The age gap is a major red flag and he's probably manipulative and is manipulating the situation so she stops having contact with her family.  This is a classic abusers tactic alienate the victim . If you love your daughter you will find a healthy way to try help her out of this situation.  Please note I said help because unfortunately she has to come to the decision on her own that this man is not  good for her at all .SHE NEEDS YOU RN!!!HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT . Try thinking about this from her POV  and you might better understand she is young vulnerable and naive and needs to learn with hopefully the help of her family YOU!!!", "All right, let's do this: get her to come home with him or without him. take her to another room saying you wish to speak to her, but take her to the room and idk call the cops or take it from there. it's honestly creepy how she selected a guy 6 years younger than her own mom but try.\n\nyou're at fault for isolating her though", "YTA. If everything you say or fear about your daughter's relationship is true, then you did exactly the worst thing possible. You need to show her unconditional love, and show her that you will be the soft spot she can land, if she's in trouble. \n\nOf course you can't tell her that it's you or him. Any 19 year old will always pick him. That's what 19 year olds do: separate from being dependent on their parents. \n\nI hope you haven't done irreparable harm to your relationship with your daughter, or even lessened her chances of being physically safe.", "\nYTA. Your daughter is in an abusive relationship. She doesn\u2019t know it yet, but she will. Please be there for her. Don\u2019t discount her. Don\u2019t make her choose.", "YTA instead of pulling her aside and telling her you'll always be there when she needs to and is ready to leave him for discovering who he is you're abandoning her and being 19 and dumb you've turned yourselves into what he is telling the two of you are.  Of course he's using her he's 36.  I understand going mad but you're preventing her from getting help in the future.", "YTA. Your daughter is most probably manipulated by her fianc\u00e9 as the age difference is indeed appalling and her behaviour seems on par with a toxic relationship. However what you essentially just did is trap her further in said relationship as she now only has him and his side of things to rely on. She won't leave him because you tell her to, nobody does that, but by making sure your relationship with her remains healthy, consistent, solid and happy, you allow her to see that her fianc\u00e9 may not be all that and that if she needs out, she has you. Your course of action here is to call her, tell her you're sorry because the holidays coming up has been stressful to you, that you understand that she has plans and that they're invited when it suits her/them best to celebrate with you as they're now both family. I know it will cost you but it's the only way.", "YTA. This man is a whole-ass predator, a 36yo man preying on a TEENAGER.\n\nAnd you know why she's so distant? Because that's what abusers do! They isolate their victims until the victim has *nobody left* they can turn to.\n\nAnd you just played *right* into his hand.\n\nGood job on doing his work for him and simultaneously showing your kid that your support for her wellbeing is conditional as hell.\n\nYou should be fucking ashamed.", "You don't like the way your daughter behaves because you can't control her? The way I'm seeing this is that she got with this man because he has the ability to get her away from you guys but you're missing all the red flags of how he's isolating her. Don't slam the door on her because she will be gone if you push. And if it escalates, the next time you'll see her is in her casket", "YTA Despite the obvious red flag of the age gap it doesn't sound like he's trying to control her, but if does sound like you are. Given you obviously desire to control her is it any wonder she's looking to escape you and that is what has caused the breakdown in the relationship. She's not a child any more, and you need to respect that you won't always come first.\n\nIt's you ask her to choose, you'll lose.", "She is very likely being groomed and abused. Please be a safe place for her to fall.", "YTA way to push her right to him. You need to stop with ultimatums. Already may be too late.", "INFO \n\nOP, when you said she needed to respect his wishes or yours, did you consider she might have her own wishes? \n\nThe relationship sounds abusive, but it also sounds as though you're pretty controlling; she may have been trying to escape one bad situation, only to land in one that's worse. \n\nIf you really care about your daughter, tell her about your feelings - you're hurt by her neglect, you're concerned about her, you miss her, you want to hear what's happening in her life. \n\nAlso, if she is in a bad situation, make sure she knows that your door is always open for her.", "NAH\n\nyou made your choice. \n\nshe has too.\n\nfair enough. everyone move on", "YTA She already chose and you did not win. Pretend that you never had that conversation.", "YTA your doing exactly what he wants and helping him isolate her. You're her mother, you tell her you're going to be there for her. You're approaching this all wrong.", "YTA she's an adult and if he is the manipulative guy your saying he is how does making her more isolated help exactly?", "Esh. \n\nMy math.. you are 42-19 means you had her at 23? Pregnant at 21-22 depending on birth month\u2026 but she cant decide at 19? It seems like you did? \n\nShe can spend holidays with someone else?!  She can decline your invitation.. if you think she is being treated poorly - be available when she needs you. \n\nHe is looney if he thinks she will stick around when she is 29 and he is 60 but they get to play that out, not you.", "Soft ESH because it doesn't sound as if you're helping much with the attitude. She is \"technically\" an adult but there's all sorts of different levels of maturity at that age. I have an autistic daughter of a similar age who I know for sure wouldn't be an equal partner in that kind of relationship. If a guy who was in his thirties when she was 12 started sniffing around her I'd threaten him with a hammer. \n\nThat said, because of the age demographic on Reddit I suspect you'll get called assholes because \"she's an adult\".\n\nI would say that if you have concerns about this guy try having a heart to heart with her rather than making ultimatums. If you don't have that level of relationship with her then unfortunately that's probably on you.", "Yta. She is 19 not 9. If she wishes to be in this relationship then she is going to be with who she wants for as long as she wants. You giving her an ultimatum is only going to push her farther away. Is he manipulating her? No idea. Do you know for sure? You have speculations but do you have proof? Have you or your husband done anything to upset her other than the current situation? Have you tried talking to her when her fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t at home?", "men like him prey on younger women cause they\u2019re easier to manipulate & control them. You\u2019re worried but giving her an ultimatum won\u2019t make her leave him.", "I think ESH. You don't give ultimatums and you don't make people choose between you and other people. That being said... This man just flirted with a girl half his age and is love-bombing her and imposing a fast pace on the relationship? That's a huge red flag, I am afraid this will not end well.\n\nI suggest you tell your daughter you are concerned about her, and send her links to pages that explain what is pathological narcissism.", "ESH except your daughter.\n\nShe. Is. Not. OK.\n\nHer behaviour is a real warning sign, and you need to be ready to help her, not cut her off and leave her in a dangerous situation. Your ultimatum enables the fiance to say \"see? I told you they were unreasonable. Listen to me, I'm right.\" And further embed his control over her.", "NTA. He is clearly abusing her, get her out.", "YTA for telling her to choose. She's a kid in an adults body and there's going to come a time she'll wake up and need you but she won't come to you at that time if you make her choose.\n\nJust let her know you'll always be there for her and let her come around", "YTA\n\nThis man is alienating your daughter from friends and family and you are making it easier for him to manipulate her.\n\nYou cannot control her or her decisions. There are some things that she will have to learn the hard way. The only thing you can give her is to have a safe place when things go bad.\n\nBetter if you can keep a \"good\" relationship to allow you to continue advising her. She doesn't have to answer or respond, but it will give her something to hold on to.", "YTA but a softer y t a as I can see where you are coming from and why.\n\nThis dude sounds like a predator with three of the big red flags.\n\nBig age gap early on (young people are easier to manipulate)\n\nGrand stand gift giving and a Lux life ( get them used to things they can not provide for them selves, develop dependence)\n\nIsolating from family and friends (no where to run)\n\nYour ultimatum whilst coming from a good place of concern is helping with the last one.

If she marries this dude, she will also want to go to her in laws for holidays or spend it with her husband", "YTA for playing right into that dirt bags hands. This is what he wanted, to drive a wedge between you and isolate her and you fell for it. You should have told her that you love her, and that while you don't support her relationship you will always be there for her, and if there ever comes the point where she realizes she needs out you will be there to help her every step of the way.
