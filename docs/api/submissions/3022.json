This man has a million red flags and is clearly trying to ensure all family and friends shut her out and stop contact - a clear sign of an abuser. They stop contact with everyone so that she's stuck in the relationship and has no one else to turn to. IMO I would apologise and say you are always here for her no matter what because ultimately that could be her lifeline.", "YTA. She's not okay, as you know she's in a very unhealthy relationship, and she's just a kid, but legally an adult so there's nothing you can do about that EXCEPT REFUSE TO ALLOW HIM TO ISOLATE HER!!!! Don't help that bastard. Be there for her even if you don't like her choice. It's going to end, but she won't have anywhere to turn. DO NOT HELP HIM ISOLATE HER.

I remember being a mature 19 year old dating a 35 year old and looking back now, I know I was a fool! I dumped thue looser because I came to my senses and listened to dad.\nDon't give your daughter ultimatums if you want her back in your life. You want her to come to you when she's hurting, not swallow har pain/shame because \"who will have my back or want me if even my parents don't!\"\n\nBe the shelter from the storm, the guiding voice.

If this is an abusive situation? Then you're threatening to cut the safe people out of her life. Mission accomplished for him. If its a young woman being completely wrapped up in herself & her relationship? Then you're cutting your nose off to spite your face. I completely understand wanting her to be more considerate but cutting her out of your life, which is what you'll be doing because she's in love & not going to leave him, seems extreme. Edit for spelling mistake.", "YTA. What are you hoping to achieve with this behaviour of yours? I get it that you don't like the dude. You probably think he is too old for her, and he probably is. He is buying her affections, well it certainly looks that way. But the fact remains that your daughter is not a minor any more, and by making her choose between you, you are just pushing her further away. So much so that she very likely will not feel that she could turn to you, if her relationship should turn sour in the future. Is that what you want?", "YTA. If you are giving an ultimatum, it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed you\u2019re the AH. (Ultimatums and boundaries are different, btw, and boundaries is not what you did).\n\nIf you really believe he\u2019s abusive, you need to support your daughter, not abandon her. If the time comes where she wants to leave him and can\u2019t rely on you for support because you tried to strongarm her into doing what you wanted earlier, she\u2019s lost what could be a very valuable part of her support system. Love her, be patient, and be there if things fall apart.", "YTA- even if he is abusive, your actions are just pushing her further into this relationship and that\u2019s if we can trust your side of the story. As far as I can tell she\u2019s not spending enough time (by your measure) with you and that\u2019s enough to claim he\u2019s abusive. You don\u2019t need ultimatums you\u2019ve already pushed her away. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t help but think she entered a relationship with a much older man, for his ability to get her away from you.", "Soft YTA, as a domestic abuse advocate this is always the starting point for may survivors, she has met this older man who is giving her everything she asks for, she is young , just an adult and he has come in with security of not having to worry about money. He has isolated her from her family and probably her friends once he has successfully done this and married her, this is where it can deteriorate quickly for her. \n\nYou giving her ultimatums pushes her to him, my advice like others have said is let her know that you\u2019re there for her, voice your concerns but leave jt there, otherwise she may be pushed away too far. \n\nThere is a reason no women closer to his age want him, and a reason he goes for younger women. The younger you are with less life experience the easier you are to manipulate and have rose tinted glasses on till it\u2019s too late", "NTA, but this is exactly the wrong way to handle this. He's manipulating her, isolating her, and that ultimatum plays right into his hands. Tell her you'll be there for her, let her know she can always come to you, otherwise she'll stay because she'll believe she has no other place to go when the relationship turns bad.", "WTH does it mean to \"choose\"? Does that mean if she decides to stay with her fiance then she is no longer welcome to her family?\n\nI would never tell my daughter (or son) that for that will push her away.  You are metaphorically kicking her out of your home.  I view a parent's role is to provide that sense of safety and security for all in the family especially for our children.\n\nI think that if we kick out our children every time they behave like asshats then they would never live with us at all.", "YTA.  If you're worried that she's being manipulated by this man, but consider that _this is exactly part of his manipulation_.  You're not an asshole for being concerned, but you desperately need to accept that she, as a legal adult, is being manipulated.  Yes, you and me and most people see it, but she doesn't, and hopefully one day she will.  When that happens, do you want his manipulation to be _so_ complete that she can't get out?", "YTA \n\nYou mean well, but the execution will just push her further into the arms of that pervert.\n\nStay in touch with her. Make sure she knows she can always come back home to you and that you love her and will be there for her.", "YTA. Either it's completely innocent relationship and your daughters priority has shift from you her parents to her spouse (which is part of growing up) or he really is controlling her and is isolating her which is the first stage of abuse. Either way as a parent your priority should be your child and supporting them, either being happy that they are growing up and starting a family of thier own and I you are hurt expressing it softly without ruining thier happiness and respecting them as an adult or being by thier side incase thier partner is bad news and you want them to know they have you as support and always come to you if need an out.", "YTA I understand completely where you were coming from however, it seems from what you stated that he\u2019s completely manipulated her and brainwashed her. There\u2019s nothing you can do at this point. Giving her an ultimatum is only going to push her farther away. You need to keep the lines of communication open. You need to continue to let her know that you are there for her. You cannot push her completely away or you will lose her forever.", "YTA, you should be doing absolutely everything to support her because she's obviously going to need it with a guy like that. If you cut her off now you might never get her back and you won't be able to help her when things eventually go wrong.", "Rough\u2026.giving ultimatums in situations like this rarely goes well. I understand you\u2019re concerned for her, but giving her that ultimatum is just going to give her fianc\u00e9 more fuel for saying \u201clook how ridiculous they\u2019re being\u201d. Pretty much between a rock and a hard place.\n\nI\u2019m saying soft YTA for the ultimatum, not for being concerned for your daughter. I would be concerned too. But I would want to be there for my child if/when this falls apart, and honestly to keep an eye on the relationship. Personally I\u2019m weirded out by that age gap\u2026", "\u2026 no judgment bc the whole thing is sad.\n\nlisten, you literally just told your daughter to leave you forever without any guilty conscience.  i am frankly shocked that you gave her an ultimatum when she has all the leverage.\n\nyou have nothing.", "YTA for how you\u2019re going about this. \n\nThis 36 year old man is into your TEEN daughter, this is unsettling and not normal. All you are doing by giving her an ultimatum is isolating her, making her more vulnerable, and dependent on this man. I don\u2019t really understand how this is \u201cunjust or disrespectful to your parental relationship\u201d ? She\u2019s young, naive, and probably being manipulated by him. You said she\u2019s already cutting contact with other members of her family. This situation should be worrying, not seen as disrespectful. By making her \u201cchoose\u201d you\u2019re just making things worse.\n\nIt\u2019s wrong to punish her for being in a toxic situation.", "YTA, this is not the right way to deal with someone who is being manipulated! If you want her back at some point than you need to show her unconditional love - that is, that she can always come back if she wants to no matter what. By giving her an ultimatum like this she is more likely to be pushed in his direction.", "NTA but she already chose and it's not you! That said he sounds like a predator, she was 18 years old, and he was 35 that's one year off. Did you condome the relationship when it first started? Him pursuing a girl her ahe was the first red flag and this just shouldn't have been allowed to happen.\n\nShe's in trouble even if she doesn't realise, and I don't think you should completely alienate her because she needs to have somewhere to go when she realises his true colours. Don't give him the opportunity to control her by manipulating her into believing he's all she has", "YTA\n\nThis could turn really bad for her. Your description of her fianc\u00e9 and their relationship gives me the heebie jeebies.\n\nIf he\u2019s trying to isolate her, giving her this ultimatum is playing directly into his script. \u201cSee, babe, it\u2019s us against the world!\u201d You need to make it crystal clear to her that if she ever needs you, if she ever needs a safe place to turn, no matter how long it\u2019s been or what\u2019s happened in the meantime, she can always ALWAYS find a safe haven with you and you will always ALWAYS be there for her.", "YTA solely for the ultimatum. this sounds like some sick predator type of stuff, and the fianc\u00e9 definitely seems to be trying to put a hole in your relationship with your daughter. giving her that ultimatum will ultimately push her into his arms, as she probably cannot see how odd his behavior is. she's young, i'm only a year older than her, and i doubt it would be easy for a person her age to notice these signs.\n\nshe'll need your help as the parent in her life to get out of this situation if it truly is as sick as it sounds to me. the ultimatum won't help, and could possibly drive her directly into an even worse scenario without you in it as a result.", "YTA\n \nI can\u2019t tell if this is a real situation or not\u2026 \n \nShe\u2019s 19. A legal adult. And I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s not financially dependent on you. So\u2026 what will be \u201ctolerated\u201d by you is a non-issue. You don\u2019t have a say in her decisions, because you don\u2019t have any leverage here. \n \nYou\u2019re gonna need to do a radical perspective and attitude change. If you are rude to her, if you act cold to her fianc\u00e9, if you are judgmental, or negative about her or him or their relationship, she\u2019s perfectly within her rights to just walk away from you. \n \nYour job as a parent to an *adult* is to be there for them. Is that super hard in this situation given the age gap and the concerns you have? Yes. \n \nBut if the concerns you have turn out to be valid, then sometime in the future she\u2019s gong to *need* you and your support. \n \nYou taking a hard line here is going to push her further away from you, and make it so she won\u2019t feel comfortable turning to you for help if she needs it.", "Oh boy, I\u2019m sorry that was an AH move and you may have lost your daughter. you think he was talking shit about you two before your ultimatum? You just handed him the ammunition to take you and her dad out of the picture forever.", "YTA but let me explain \n\n\nI'm really sorry to hear this\nI have a terrible relationship with parents and giving an ultimatum will only get it worse.\n\nI understand the parenthood thinking behind loosing a child due to unwise life choices like this but you need to her go, let her burn or let her be right. People learn on others mistakes but not everyone, she must fail to learn from it and get up stronger. If she fail, she will be smart enough to come back to you. If she'll make her choices right, she'll also come back, but only if You let her go now.\nI know You see this by a \"young and stupid\" glasses and I see it too by what You describe, but she wants you to be happy for her, which You can't because of her actions.\nSo don't force her to anything... Let her learn in the most human way.\n\n\nAnd by saying all this i have my own exactly the same experience, except i didn't choose a person, but a different life than what parents wanted for me\n\nBest wishes < 3", "YTA\n\nYour response to thinking your daughter is in a (psychologically) abusive relationship is to try and cut her off.\n\nSure you can say if she accepted the ultimatum then she's the one cutting you off, but you knew that's how it would go so its immaterial. Like when someone treats their romantic partner badly because they want to break up, but have the other person do it.\n\nIf you truly believe their relationship is coercive and manipulative why are you trying to create a reality where if you daughter one day realises that and wants to escape, she has no where to go?", "Info: have you been making snide comments to her about her fianc\u00e9?", "YTA - My father didn\u2019t approve my relationship in the first place and he said something similar but he ended up being there for me at my wedding and walking me down the aisle. \n\nYou should not put your daughter in a position to pick one or the other. I understand that parents sometimes do not approve the choices of their kids but you should respect her choices and try to understand the actual problem. \nSit down with her and tell her your feelings, looks like you feel abandoned since she is engaged. Talk it out. \n\nAs a parent you should be there for her, no matter what. It\u2019s your daughter!", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult. You may not like her current life choices, but you have no say in them (despite being her mother). Your ultimatum is unjust, and will only make her retreat to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s arms for comfort.", "Well, considering how resistant you are to idea of her having her own life and how you want to control her choices, it's no wonder if she's found her way into an abusive controlling relationship. That is what you've taught her love looks like. \n\nCongratulations, you've succeeded in creating the perfect controllable puppet and then you lost control of it to a more skilled manipulator.\n\nESH except your daughter, because at this point she can't know better, but all the rest of you should.", "YTA there is absolutely no reason for your behavior. Your ego is getting in the way of your relationship. I understand you\u2019re hurt because she\u2019s pulling away but if you would just let her go through this she will come back around. You need to apologize", "YTA. You decided to cut off your daughter, who you admit is in a vulnerable position, because she chose to not have Thanksgiving with you. Her choosing to not visit you isn't disrespecting your wishes.", "NTA- you should be worried about your daughter because that is a scary age gap, however she\u2019s legally an adult and will live the life she wants. I don\u2019t think the ultimatum is the right move because it just pushes her further away.", "I understand why you\u2019re concerned, but this was a colossally misguided way to handle it. Your daughter is being manipulated by a man twice her age. But she\u2019s still young enough to be naive in the ways of the world. In issuing this ultimatum, you\u2019ve treated her like someone who\u2019s worldly enough to know what she wants and what she\u2019s doing, which she\u2019s not. You\u2019ve basically forced someone who\u2019s clearly not mature enough to make big life decisions to make another big life decision. You\u2019re setting her up for failure. You two need to examine your daughter\u2019s situation, not just her behavior, and act accordingly. You\u2019re too eager to make this about your emotions and it\u2019s left you blind to your daughter\u2019s reality. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She is your daughter, no matter what. Sure, she is distant to you at the moment, might we call it something like \"Love is blind\"?  Have you been at their place lately? It seems like the ball is always in her court when it comes to visiting.\n\nShe is young, she is still discovering life.  She will make mistakes and that is when she needs you most of all. Be there for her.", "YTA, people going to chew me but WTH. although i understand your frustration and pain but the truth is daughter is an adult. you don't have any rights to her life. as a parent you had your 18 years to teach them and guide them.\n\nIn your post you did not explain your daughter fianc\u00e9 character. it seem like you have problem with his age. you did not inform any bad character. do you think your daughters stop responding because you always naggings about her boy friend.'\n\nUltimatum is always ends in resentful. talk to her be support her. if you feel she going to fail be there for her to support.", "So\u2026 she\u2019s being brainwashed and your response is to give her an ultimatum\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s 19. So she\u2019s an adult but just barely and I\u2019ll agree this sounds worrying but - what happens if she picks him? And then realises this is an issue in 5 years time? Will she feel trapped and that she has no choice but to stay because her parents made her chose and she chose and now has no way out?", "YTA and you don\u2019t want them together because you \u201cdon\u2019t like what\u2019s she\u2019s become\u201d.  Perhaps he really loves her? You don\u2019t like he gives her gifts, you don\u2019t like he proposed. You say he\u2019s brainwashed her. I\u2019m afraid you will drive her further into his arms by giving her an ultimatum.  What sort of parent does that?", "Why respect your wishes?  It is clear that you hate her being with him and have made it so miserable that she has decided to distance herself from you both.\n\nYou talk about him buying things for her as manipulative but don't see the hypocrisy of you giving her an ultimatum.\n\nYTA.", "Your daughter is **clearly** in an abusive relationship. Instead of trying to help her, you threaten to abandon her.\n\nAnd then you have the gall to come here and ask if YTA? Yes. Yes, you are. YTA.", "YTA how did you think that would help?\n\nShe already chose him and your ultimatum only removed her ability to come running back to you when he starts beating her.", "YTA  I'm just not buying your explanation for why you don't like him.  She may be distancing herself from you because she picks up vibes that you don't approve of him.  She is old enough to make choices of who she wants to be in a relationship with.  While he might not be your choice for her, you need to be supportive of her right to date the person who makes HER happy.  If you don't, and you draw a line in the sand and make her choose, be prepared to lose.  That isn't a fair ultimatum to give to your daughter.", "YTA at some point you need to step back. Your daughter is a grown ass woman. If it is indeed a bad relationship be there for her when the light bulb comes on.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry she's in a relationship that you disapprove of, but this sort of ultimatum isn't the way to hold on to her; it's the way to drive her away.\n\nIt's not unreasonable to spend Thanksgiving with his family instead of hers, assuming they will alternate. And perhaps your obvious disapproval makes his family more attractive than your own.\n\nIf they're \"hiding out\" at his family's cabin (i.e. not spending Thanksgiving with *either* family, but by themselves), then that's pretty immature, but still fully within their rights; certainly not something worth going *no-contact* over.

Meaning both of them. Otherwise a) you\u2019ll loose her forever b) you won\u2019t be able to see what\u2019s happening if it is potentially abusive.\n\nGiving her an ultimatum when she is likely in danger is shortsighted. You should back down and look at the long game of how to support your daughter.\n\nThat way you can have conversations that will help you keep her safe. This is not about you. It\u2019s about her, so YTA.", "YTA x 100. You should heed your daughter's advice and get some sleep. You literally drove her so far from you with that ultimatim, and now she's going to think twice about reaching out to you if she ever gets in an unsafe situation!", "So your teenage daughter is in the hands of a predator, and you decided to shame and cut ties with her- the victim- because you're upset she's in such a vulnerable position?  How does that do anything other than ensure that when the real abuse begins that she feels like she has nowhere else to run?  Good job mom-hope you feel just as self-righteous when the police call you to identify the body. YTA", "NTA. Talk it out with your daughter to explain your concerns about her partner.", "NTA your methods are questionable but not as questionable as that guy", "Bad move..u flucked up.", "\n\nAn ultimatum isn\u2019t going to do anything. Nothing you do will change what she does. So by putting down ultimatums like that, you\u2019re just pushing her away more. Soft YTA but only because what you did won\u2019t get you what you want", "YTA for pushing your child away. How do you think this will end for her?\n\nWhen this relationship comes crashing down, you want her to run to you, not away. YTA again.", ">...she just told us to sleep because we seemed sleep deprived from the foolish questions we were asking.\n\nThat's her giving you a last chance to rethink that question before you never see or hear from her again.", "Wow YTA and trust me\u2026this will backfire on you and you will not get the results you want. First of all, she\u2019s an adult and giving her an ultimatum is disgusting. Secondly, she is going to need her parents when this relationship fails. You need to rethink this and fast. Shame on you!", "YTA. You may be pushing her to stay with a guy who is abusing her. \n\nETA I see I'm not the only one who sees the red flags.", "YTA please tell her because she will need your help in the future against her groomer. He is on his way to reach his goal of alienating her from her family.\n\nKeep your contact with her. Tell her you love her and show her that you trust her. If you tell her she is making a mistake, she will just stick more to him. You need to be a person of trust to her!", "YTA. Listen to the podcast \u201csomething was wrong\u201d season 1. he\u2019s clearly an abuser and your daughter needs your help.", "Yta this seems more of a \u201che can\u2019t be controlling only I can\u201d", "YTA and lack a basic understanding of parenting. And psychology. And life.", "So I think I always have a problem with the language load in a lot of these posts.   You put yourself on a pedestal and then tear him down then ask AITA? \n\nIt sounds like you never gave him a chance because you don't approve of the age difference.  Is it possible that this isn't some grand psychological manipulation but rather your daughter is not interested in spending the holidays with you because you're acting like a jerk? \n\nSo yes YTA.\n\nAlso which one is it fellow redditors? Is she a human being capable of making decisions about her own life? Or is she a girl in need of protection?", "YTA - Simply because from what you say, she's in an abusive relationship and the last thing she needs is for her parents to give up on her.", "YTA. She needs you now more that ever, and sadly this may be a mistake she must make for herself. She needs to know you will always be there, even when you don\u2019t agree with her choices.", "YTA. You will only be pushing her further away, you're clearly expecting her to choose you and you will probably be bitterly disappointed. What you are doing is manipulation and cruel and will cost you your relationship with your daughter and any future grandchildren.", "She's going to chose him and if he's abusive she's going to have nowhere to run to. I know you don't want your daughter in that situation.", "Agreed that abusers often alienate the victim. Don't shut her out, that's what he wants. Also shutting her out continues to put her man on a pedestal. She needs to learn the red flags herself. It's unfortunate that an upcoming marriage is involved, but don't give this guy what he wants and separate her from you guys.", "Exactly, he\u2019s spent a year grooming her and his isn\u2019t going to stop. At least keeping a pulse on her will give you an idea of how deep the hole is", "It\u2019s not surprising she fell into this trap if you look at how her parents treat her.", "This. OP please, please PLEASE apologise to your daughter, do whatever it takes to maintain contact, read Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft, and be ready to swoop in when she\u2019s ready; this may save her life. Abusive controlling manipulative men are some of the most terrifying people.", "Yeah, this is not going to end well for Op's daughter, and OP you need to be a safe line for when shit hits the fan, and it will. That girl is gonna end up at the very least baby trapped, and probably worse. \n\nThis is not a sorting holiday situation, it's a \"how to keep contact with my daughter and be there for her when she will need it\" and giving her an ultimatum is not what is going to save her life down that abuse road. \n\nYou have the right to disagree with her choices and telling her, but if you want to still have a daughter in a few years you need to assure her you'll always be her safe place and that you'll get her out when she needs it. She'll scoff and call you paranoid now, but when he'll hit/assault her, she'll remember.", "This! She needs to feel like she can leave him when she\u2019s ready Bc she has a place to go. The last thing you want is for her to stay with him Bc she feels trapped and alone. Be her escape plan! Don\u2019t cut her off!", "I should have listened to dad but felt his words were contradictory since he abused my mom.", "What can the police do? Seriously though, I get the age gap is extremely alarming, but she is 19 (a legal adult) and the police can't do anything, there aren't any laws being broken. Doing what you suggest would only make things worse.", "I felt truly sick reading this because I have been there too. Its hell. I'm glad you're free now \ud83e\udde1\n\n\n@OP YTA don't shut her out or cut her off with ultimatums or the next time you see her in person could be her hospital bed or funeral. It sounds dramatic but that's because it IS dramatic. Abusive relationships are extremely dangerous and far too often fatal.", "Oo, and I agree with you it will probably be used that way, but how can OPs parents know that? Like I'm not defending them cutting her off or anything but it's not like most people even believe domestic abuse is real let alone able to read the signs and react accordingly", "Don't stand, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me", "My mom told me the only reason she got mixed up with my alcoholic, abusive dad was because she desperately wanted to leave her repressive parents. She jumped into a relationship with the first guy that showed her any interest. Within a year she got pregnant twice and had me a month after her 18th bday. She stayed, in part, due to her parents reactions.", "No one ever said parenting is easy. But the first job of a parent is to protect their child.", "The two are not mutually exclusive and I feel sorry for you because you seem to think that they are. You can be hurt by your kids' behavior and still do your absolute best to keep them safe.", "Yes. I'm a parent. Shockingly, I have not always agreed with my kids' choices! Sometimes, I have even been hurt by their choices. \n\nBut you know what? I'm their goddamn MOM. I am employed, I work sick hours, but it is my PRIMARY JOB in life to ensure my kids are independent and OKAY. If they go out with friends and they don't make sure the DD stays sober? Call me. I don't want it to even cross their mind to see if *maybe* the DD is sober enough to get home. Why? BECAUSE I'M THEIR MOM AND THEIR SAFETY COMES BEFORE MY FEELINGS.", "And they *wonder* why she equates someone having power over her with love!", "Yup. That\u2019s exactly how I ended up with my abusive and rapey first husband.", "Same. I later learned about how when you grow up in such environments, the control seems familiar to you so you don\u2019t pick up red flag early enough and with desire to leave your current shitty family situation you can end up in really rough relationships. Took me a while to break out of it. And now I\u2019m so much better, I\u2019m also low contact with my repressive parents", "Not if they deatache themself... and thats a shitty excuse to let one beeing treadet as a doormate.. \"i need to be there for every asshole because live sucks for them otherwise and it may end bad for them\" guildtrip someone else please", "she is not a child .. she is an adult who treads her parents badly", "....Ohem thats totally Different.....I have No Problem helping them Out of someone Else f...uped its Not their fault when dd Drinks....also Here they are legally allowed to Drink with 16..If they f...Up I will bail them Out anyway.  But of course their may be consequences (my 2 daughters forgot their Ballett Gear their father left Work Early to Bring them...but they Had to pay the gas (it was half their allowance for a week so they are fine i would handle it the Same If they are drunk and the dd) but this Kid does Not want to be bailed Out....she is hurting her Patents......its Like watching a Kid driving drunk from the Seat beside", "Having those kind of relationships with your parents makes you more likely to end up in similarly bad romantic relationships, IMO", "Damn, that's rough. I'm glad you got out.", "Sorry the were so many typos in this sentence I may not have understood it, but are you seriously saying if parents have to plan their child's funeral, they can avoid being hurt by \"detaching\" from it? That's not a thing. No one can turn off emotions of dealing with possibly the worse thing one could ever deal with.", "Your lack of empathy is astonishing. And it\u2019s actually the parents treating their daughter badly.", "Eighteen is a baby adult. They just became an adult and they lack experience. Would your answer change if you knew that this girl was being coerced or abused by this predator?", "You are projecting. Are you a parent? Were you hurt by your child? Or have you seen this happen to someone you love? Regardless you are obviously speaking from personal hurt, and that's not really useful on AITA.\n\nI hope you get better!", "You are playing right in to this guys hands. He wants your daughter to be cut off from you. \n\nI understand that you feel disrespected by your daughter, but the reality is that she has him whispering in her ear. \n\nShe feels like she is between a rock and a hard place. Everyone is pulling her. If she goes to you she upsets him, if she goes to him she upsets you.  He is going to use those negative feelings to manipulate her. \n\nPlease call your daughter and apologise. Say that you hope she had a wonderful thanksgiving and you hope to see her soon.  Invite her to the cinema, something low stakes and easy.", "Oh certainly. Like it's not impossible that despite the age gap they just happen to match well and the distancing herself is her distancing from toxic family and finally as a young adult having that capability.\n\nBut it's probably toxic on both ends the guy and the parent more or less. Parents that throw out ultimatum like that are auto red flags to me.", "Thank you so much. Things are much better now.", "Detaching from the Kid..Not the fureral...they have two Options...stay in contact...watch the child get hurt AND get treaded Like shit...or nc...Not watching and Not getting hurt..nothing they say and do will make Said child Change Her behavior...she is an adult they have No leverage....so I know what i would do...but you do you....I am Not an machoist", "I am very empathic to the Patents...and lol nope", "Baby adult lol......you cant carry a Horse to the Water...she is legally and adult....If she wants to be in an abusive relationship their is nothing I could do...but i would def. Not stand beside her and and watch it...I am Not a machoist....And I also do Not enjoy being hurt...she wants to come.back...great ..bit I would certainly expect her to make Up what she did to me...because my child or Not...I expect everybody to be a decent human beiing . If you are Not i do Not want to be arround you...because lI have Selfworth. You do Not get a free Pass Just because  your my Kid.", "You are a much nicer person than I am. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you for being.", "Yes,.No, No .....nope Not personal", "Yeah, agreed. The \"will not be tolerated\" is a dead giveaway. \n\nSo is the guy being in his mid 30s and interested in an 18 year old. \n\nShe's stuck in the middle with probably not a lot of great options."]}
