I don\u2019t like tipping myself, but when you\u2019re in a foreign land, you have to adapt to local cultures. Your uncle is a huge AH.", "As another Australian YTA\n\nYou know that tipping is important in the US and hiding behind your uncle being a jerk as a reason does not change that. If your uncle says no to tipping why not pay it yourself? \n\nYour age isn\u2019t listed but you must at least be a teenager so old enough to do the right thing instead of being an AH and pretending it\u2019s out of your hands", "YTA and so is your uncle. You're acting like you don't have a mind of your own but you do; you're either a coward or as selfish as your uncle. It's one thing not to tip if the service is bad but that isn't the case. If you all don't want to tip, don't stuff your faces at restaurants. Stay in and cook instead.", "YTA", "Many of us Americans believe that the restaurant industry is the ultimate AH for lowballing pay and benefits for their employees and relying on customers to make up the difference via tips.  That point aside, being a non-tipper in the US is absolutely YTA behavior.  Tips are used by many to supplement their horrible below minimum wage in this country.  They are not luxurious add-ons.  When you don't tip at a sit-down restaurant, it's assumed that you were either deeply dissatisfied with your meal and service or you're a cheapskate who doesn't care about underpaid workers.", "You don\u2019t say what state your in, which impacts how much of an A your uncle is (he is TA regardless, we\u2019re just talking levels). US waitstaff are typically paid less per hour than other workers on the theory that tips will bring them up to at least minimum wage. \n\nMinimum wage varies by state so I\u2019ll stick with the federal minimum wage to explain the math here. The federal minimum wage is the absolute lowest someone can be paid legally, but states can pass laws for higher minimum wages.\n\nThe federal minimum wage overall is $7.25/hour. The minimum wage for tipped employees is just $2.13/hour, and the tips are supposed to bring them up to $7.25/hour. If waitstaff are not making enough tips to get to $7.25/hour, the restaurant is supposed to make up the difference but if they don\u2019t, waitstaff rarely have the resources to sue for what they are owed. \n\nYes it\u2019s a stupid system but you and your uncle are taking it out on the wrong people. If your uncle feels so strongly about it, he should exclusively eat at restaurants where tips are already included in service fees, also known as tipless restaurants. Why would you go to a place knowing you\u2019re one of the worst customers they\u2019ll have that night and then just blame it on your uncle like you have a free pass for being Australian? If Americans come to Australia and break well-known social customs, do you give them a break if they say an Australian relative told them they could?", "YTA. Tipping is the custom here. Stiffing someone doing a service for you does not do anything or send any message to anybody but a \"fuck you\" to the server. Tip.", "YTA", "Can I come to your country and stick with all my customs, or should I follow Australian customs?\n\nYTA\n\nTipping is BS, and needs to go away. However, it;s how people make a living. DO it or don;t go out. You and your uncle are assholes here.", "YTA \u2014 you\u2019re in US, you tip. If you\u2019re not tipping then there should be a service-based reason for it. Even then, the degree of the service issue is reflected on the percentage given. \n\nIt\u2019s a real Asshole move to go to the same restaurant and do it repeatedly. \n\nThey definitely know who you are and you can bet the cooks know who you are too\u2026", "The servers get something like 2.15 (like 3.25ish aus$) an hour and rely on tips. Any american that doesnt tip in u.s. is a cheapskate ah.\n\nSoft YTA since yer aussie and didnt know", "YTA. We all know the tipping/wage system in the US is terrible and unfair, but that\u2019s the system we have and we have to use it. You can\u2019t just choose not to pay the servers because you think their bosses should pay them, even though you know that\u2019s how it works. \n\nWhen I go to other countries, I don\u2019t order food in a restaurant, then decide the food is overpriced and pay less than I owe. If you don\u2019t want to spend so much total money then go to a restaurant where the food is 20% cheaper and leave a tip.", "Tips is how waitstaff in the US get most of their pay. Minimum wage for food service is vastly lower than for anything else, because the government believes the owners, that good staff make enough tips. I would say, according to the waitstaff, YTA, but if you're merely ignorant and believing your uncle, your uncle ITA and you are his tool.", "YTA. Well, not you necessarily but your uncle definitely is. Most people in the service industry live and die by their tips. It\u2019s is literally factored into their wages.", "YTA if you keep going along with this. If he wants to pull this kind of thing, then your uncle should be the one paying the bill himself in person.", "If your Uncle said to jump off a cliff.......\n\nYTA OP--- you will never meet a wealthy waitress in the USA.", "Aussie here. Your uncle is an asshole. Not \u2018believing\u2019 in tipping in a place where tipping is an inherent part of the wage system, is 100% asshole. \nIf you follow his lead or listen to his advice, then you are an asshole too. \n\nYou asked here because you know better. Be better.", "YTA.  you are not wrong about being mindless.  you don\u2019t have a backbone and just do what you uncle told you to do.", "YTA. You're a visitor to the U.S. and your uncle is willfully ignorant about tipping because it serves his purposes by saving him money.\n\nThe people serving you don't get paid a living wage and rely on tips to survive. Just because your uncle is an AH doesn't mean you need to be one.", "Your uncle is a huge AH, and by association YTA too.\n\nPeople working tipped wage jobs in the US do not earn even minimum wage (not a viable living wage either). Here's a table from the department of labor of tipped wages by state: [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped). $2.13 an hour is deplorable.\n\nPlease tip your wait staff and vote for ballot initiatives that include increasing minimum wage.", "YTA- you can afford a vacation in the US from AUS. Use your uncle\u2019s money to pay for the dinner and pony up for a damned tip you cheap ass. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a big one.", "The part that will come back to bite you and your uncle is the waitstaff will learn you don't tip and your service will reflect that.", "I mean I guess NTA but your uncle is a huge asshole\n\nI\u2019ve worked service jobs in the US - tipping is the expected custom. You cannot visit a foreign country and apply your own customs to it.", "Wait, did I read this correctly? You are going to THE SAME restaurant every night and stiffing the server!?!?  Dude, you are a brave person!", "YTA \n\nAnd also, if your uncle can't deal with tipping, he should have opted for a different vacation destination.", "NAH - the real ah are the restaurants for not paying their employees a livable wage and your Uncle for not tipping since it's his money. Though you could tip and just tell him you didn't unless he asks for receipts", "Time to stop taking your cousins to restaurants for a few of reasons. You are their cousin and not their parent and he is passing off his responsibilities on you. He's TA for that alone. Then, he's using his money to control you. He's a TA for that. Finally, he's insisting that you violate the customs in the country you are visiting and this can affect how the people there view & treat you. He's an AH for setting you up to fail socially. Your parents need to know these things, especially if you are a minor (you didn't specify so I don't know). \n\nIs he otherwise abusive? \n\nI hate for you to miss out on the benefits of this trip but should he continue his BS behavior it might be best to cut the trip short, if possible.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t be a c#nt. Tip a minimum of 15% for decent service.", "ESH. We tip at a sit-down restaurant (with wait service) in the US. Anyone can look up where to tip or not tip .. and how much $/%. If your uncle was smarter, then he'd perhaps try to understand *why* we tip in this scenario. The wait staff is not paid a normal wage for this job. For example, in Texas, normal wait staff will earn $2.13/hr plus tips. The minimum wage (for a normal job) is set at $7.25. And most places like fast food restaurants and retail are paying $15/hr +/-. So that's why you're supposed to tip.", "Don't tip if you don't want to not because your uncle says not to", "NTA on your end, but your uncle is a massive AH. You can't be expected to go against his wishes with his money. It's illegal to spend his money without his authorization.\n\nWhat you ought to do is refuse to take them out. Tell him if he's going to make you behave like an AH. He can do it himself.", "Only one asshole here to be honest, he's right.  It's his money so he has the right to decide how it's spent.  And tipping should be for people who do an excellent job.  The only asshole is the business that's so shitty it can't operate without slave labor.  A tippers wage needs to die and tipping needs to go back to a BONUS for a job well done.", "NTA. He is though. Tell him to go home. If you can, see if you can get your own money to tip since he obviously isn't brave enough or too lazy to go himself.", "NTA. People act like tips replace the wage but they only supplement. Servers will make minimum wage without tips. And by sitting here and getting mad at consumers for not tipping, you just let the companies win as usual. Classic infighting when you should be taking those dollars and doing something productive with em.", "Nta, tipping is voluntary and if your uncle doesn't have enough money to tip, it is what it is\n\n\nEdit: if you are always at the same restaurant without tipping, I'd consider changing it up a bit", "I always like people who say \"I like to save money so I don't tip\".
