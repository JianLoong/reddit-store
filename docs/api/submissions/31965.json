I don\u2019t like tipping myself, but when you\u2019re in a foreign land, you have to adapt to local cultures. Your uncle is a huge AH.", "As another Australian YTA\n\nYou know that tipping is important in the US and hiding behind your uncle being a jerk as a reason does not change that. If your uncle says no to tipping why not pay it yourself? \n\nYour age isn\u2019t listed but you must at least be a teenager so old enough to do the right thing instead of being an AH and pretending it\u2019s out of your hands", "YTA and so is your uncle. You're acting like you don't have a mind of your own but you do; you're either a coward or as selfish as your uncle. It's one thing not to tip if the service is bad but that isn't the case. If you all don't want to tip, don't stuff your faces at restaurants. Stay in and cook instead.", "YTA", "Many of us Americans believe that the restaurant industry is the ultimate AH for lowballing pay and benefits for their employees and relying on customers to make up the difference via tips.  That point aside, being a non-tipper in the US is absolutely YTA behavior.  Tips are used by many to supplement their horrible below minimum wage in this country.  They are not luxurious add-ons.  When you don't tip at a sit-down restaurant, it's assumed that you were either deeply dissatisfied with your meal and service or you're a cheapskate who doesn't care about underpaid workers.", "You don\u2019t say what state your in, which impacts how much of an A your uncle is (he is TA regardless, we\u2019re just talking levels). US waitstaff are typically paid less per hour than other workers on the theory that tips will bring them up to at least minimum wage. \n\nMinimum wage varies by state so I\u2019ll stick with the federal minimum wage to explain the math here. The federal minimum wage is the absolute lowest someone can be paid legally, but states can pass laws for higher minimum wages.\n\nThe federal minimum wage overall is $7.25/hour. The minimum wage for tipped employees is just $2.13/hour, and the tips are supposed to bring them up to $7.25/hour. If waitstaff are not making enough tips to get to $7.25/hour, the restaurant is supposed to make up the difference but if they don\u2019t, waitstaff rarely have the resources to sue for what they are owed. \n\nYes it\u2019s a stupid system but you and your uncle are taking it out on the wrong people. If your uncle feels so strongly about it, he should exclusively eat at restaurants where tips are already included in service fees, also known as tipless restaurants. Why would you go to a place knowing you\u2019re one of the worst customers they\u2019ll have that night and then just blame it on your uncle like you have a free pass for being Australian? If Americans come to Australia and break well-known social customs, do you give them a break if they say an Australian relative told them they could?", "YTA. Tipping is the custom here.

We all know the tipping/wage system in the US is terrible and unfair, but that\u2019s the system we have and we have to use it.

If you don\u2019t want to spend so much total money then go to a restaurant where the food is 20% cheaper and leave a tip.", "Tips is how waitstaff in the US get most of their pay. Minimum wage for food service is vastly lower than for anything else, because the government believes the owners, that good staff make enough tips.

You cannot visit a foreign country and apply your own customs to it.", "Wait, did I read this correctly? You are going to THE SAME restaurant every night and stiffing the server!?!?  Dude, you are a brave person!", "YTA \n\nAnd also, if your uncle can't deal with tipping, he should have opted for a different vacation destination.", "NAH - the real ah are the restaurants for not paying their employees a livable wage and your Uncle for not tipping since it's his money.

You are their cousin and not their parent and he is passing off his responsibilities on you. He's TA for that alone. Then, he's using his money to control you. He's a TA for that. Finally, he's insisting that you violate the customs in the country you are visiting and this can affect how the people there view & treat you. He's an AH for setting you up to fail socially. Your parents need to know these things, especially if you are a minor (you didn't specify so I don't know). \n\nIs he otherwise abusive? \n\nI hate for you to miss out on the benefits of this trip but should he continue his BS behavior it might be best to cut the trip short, if possible.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t be a c#nt.

If your uncle was smarter, then he'd perhaps try to understand *why* we tip in this scenario. The wait staff is not paid a normal wage for this job. For example, in Texas, normal wait staff will earn $2.13/hr plus tips. The minimum wage (for a normal job) is set at $7.25. And most places like fast food restaurants and retail are paying $15/hr +/-. So that's why you're supposed to tip.", "Don't tip if you don't want to not because your uncle says not to", "NTA on your end, but your uncle is a massive AH.

And tipping should be for people who do an excellent job.  The only asshole is the business that's so shitty it can't operate without slave labor.  A tippers wage needs to die and tipping needs to go back to a BONUS for a job well done.", "NTA. He is though. Tell him to go home. If you can, see if you can get your own money to tip since he obviously isn't brave enough or too lazy to go himself.", "NTA. People act like tips replace the wage but they only supplement.

So $23.23AUS is about $15US, which is minimum (or less than) in many HCOL places. The coffee shop near my work (HCOL area) has a barista position for $22-23/hr (about $33/hr AUS). I would assume that living in a LCOL place in Australia is better than the US due to wage discrepancy but in the HCOL places it\u2019s probably closer to par but this is a huge assumption and you\u2019d really need to go on a city to city basis, I mean you can compare New York with Sydney with a vast spreadsheet on how expensive different brands of milk are but I can easily tell you St Louis or Pittsburgh or Houston are vastly cheaper.\n\nKeep in mind fast food is untipped labor in the US so\u2026 the prices for Big Macs *should* roughly be the same.\n\nI\u2019ve worked service, I know people who do, and trust me - there is really no group more reviled uniformly in the US than non-tippers. You have this custom where you are *obliged* to give 15% or $1 or whatever and you violate the social contract and stiff - you\u2019re an asshole in this culture.\n\nOverall though you can say \u201cah well to everyone who isn\u2019t American this custom is dumb\u201d and I can come back and say the custom exists exactly like this in Canada (and supposedly Columbia, as well as a lot of central and South America), to a certain degree in Egypt, and to a muted degree in Western Europe (and - in fact - tipping was first hated in the US because it was associated *with* Europe) but even assuming it was just an American thing - this is an arbitrary distinction. What if they US split into 20 countries, would that make it more acceptable now that it\u2019s \u201cinternational?\u201d Ultimately some places are just weird and you do have to take them as they are. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to anyone else\u201d isn\u2019t really an excuse if it isn\u2019t a crime against humanity. There are things I don\u2019t understand in many cultures but I just take it as they are.\n\nThis is probably not the place but I do feel westerners in particular struggle to understand the US as a country because for a long time it very aggressively sought a non-European identity and pushed itself away from Europe in a way that most of the rest of the world did or could not, and this has created cultural divergence.\n\nEd: this turned into a weird screed but hopefully this kind of summarizes why if you don\u2019t tip you are TA, really I would say not understanding a custom is not an excuse (anywhere) and the uniqueness of the custom is arbitrary\n\nIf you really think im nice and want to know more on my experience in the service industry in the US you can DM if you don\u2019t feel like making huge threads, idc. Just keep in mind I have work in the morning", "I think most rational people here in the States would probably agree that the fact that our minimum wage is not a living wage is ridiculous (especially for the service industry).\nBut, it still exists, and people have to live on their pay.\nA lot of people want change, but our Congress runs at a glacial pace, and people still need to live and eat and take care of their kids. So, just fucking tip in the US. As I said in a previous comment elsewhere, tip according to the service received, but tip something (unless they were godawful).\nAnd OP (and his uncle) are unequivocally TAs.", "Good for you", "You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve met that admits to being a white supremacist in order to defend your choice in stealing from poor people.", "Minimum wage is minimum wage in most developed countries - none of this nonsense of a reduced minimum wage for employees being paid tips", "Its not allowed to pay more?", "Because paying 2-3$ per hour is a shitty culture", "Tipping origins come from chattel slavery in the US. You would give a penny or two to slaves at the house you were visiting to show how generous and kind you are to the other highly performative antebellum white people.", "Nope can\u2019t do. It\u2019s my money and my time. If I want to go to a sit down restaurant to eat and the prices without the tip are within my budget, I\u2019ll do just that. I\u2019ll tip what I can. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I will be back in the US anytime soon because it\u2019s really not the most appealing country. But if I were to go back, I\u2019m enjoying myself. It\u2019s getting ridiculous.", "I life in a country where the employees are paid by the employers.\n\nThey dont need the tipp to survive.\n\n\nWhy you dont want to tell me how many tipp you get a month?", "What is impressive is that in one of the most evolved (?) countries in the world, people need the tips to survive, while in other less evolved places in the world people are actually paid for doing their job.", "Is this the maximum or minimum wage?\n\nAre manager allowed to pay more?", "i know", "I never did.", "Yeah. America's fucked up, right?\n\nDo you get it now?", "\"Its\" is referring to what/whom? The employer? The minimum wage? The tipper?", "JFC. If they're getting tipped, they're making minimum wage. Or even better. Maybe gratuities should be at a fixed rate everywhere. But then the chances for a server to make a 30, 40, or even 50% tip just disappear\n\nSomeone who doesn't tip in America is just a shitty person. Y'all can die on your hill, I'll RIP over on mine", "Then you're an asshole.", "So do I. I'm Australian. I don't tip waiters in Australia. But we're not talking about Australia, we're talking about America. And in America, you tip because that's how servers make ends meet. And if I were to go to America, I'd tip. And  if I thought the system needed to change, I would rather boycott instead of stiffing the waiters. You can't just change the context halfway through the debate.", "The employer.\n\nCan he just pay more so the tipp is not necessary?", "But thats not my problem that they accepted a low wage and the hope for luck to make money.", "Thats why i would boycott tipping", "Yeah, they totally could. They're just allowed to pay less than minimum because America always has, and sadly will (for now), continuously exploit the poor and working class :/\n\nThe bottom line is: if you don't tip, you aren't hurting the system, you aren't hurting lawmakers, you aren't hurting employers. You're hurting people who expected it for their service. It's a service fee, the amount of which the customer decides.\n\nAnd it isn't hard to do the math on a 15-20% tip for an item before you buy it. And if it is, most of us have phones with calculators on them", "They don't hope. They expect somewhere between 10-20%"]}
