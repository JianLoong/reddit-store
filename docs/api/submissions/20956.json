I have attributed this to a few factors but there could be more. : \n\n * the guest that booked read the rules and description and knows what they are getting into, the guests guest, did not and may not have chosen this particular listing.  \n * the guest will be reviewed by host (repurcussions) the guest of guest will not and thus has no repercussions.  \n * the guests guest may be a bad guest that most hosts would never accept, the booking guest may be a great guest and going to be pulled down ( due to association with their friend).  \n\nThere are a set of people that view institutional (large corporations, government, etc) property as lesser value than personal property (free game or communal ).  Some of these people assume that vacation homes / Short Term Rentals are always some big company (not a private owner letting out their personal home or vacation home when not in use by themselves), and thus by association, the vacation home property is lesser value...", "That's completely untrue about the spoons.

And she was kicking our butts on making it up the mountain.", "YTA\n\nBoth of you are being overly dramatic. \n\nI regularly run both the good knives and my wooden stuff through the dishwasher. They are fine. She didn't cause irrevocable damage to either item. A little olive oil and your wooden spoon will be exactly as it was. \n\nAs to treating stranger's stuff well...it's an Airbnb. No one leaves nice stuff in an Airbnb. If they didn't want it run through the dishwasher, they would not have it in the Airbnb. That is an extremely safe assumption to make.\n\n I also suspect your mother regularly runs her own good knives and wooden things through the dishwasher at her house. Because she didn't think twice about doing it here.\n\nShe was sorry because she knows *you* prefer your stuff be hand washed and were getting upset. She was apologizing because she knows your preference and accidentally didn't go along with it. \n\nHad both items belonged to the Airbnb, then she would have been following their wishes on how to treat them: they would 100% prefer kitchen things were cleaned and sanitized *in the dishwasher* than risk the potential oogie getting stuck on them for the next guest.\n\nOn the whole, you seem overly controlling and need to unclench. Is it seriously worth ruining the entire vacation over a made up morality situation you won't let go?", "YTA if you bring items that are hard to maintain or clean then you need to do the work  of cleaning or maintaining them yourself.", "YTA. Do you want to be happy or right? She apologized for accidentally mistreating your things. It's absolutely bonkers of you to think that an Airbnb's kitchen utensils need to be handwashed so you can flex some sort of moral high ground here.", "NAH... often resort items go through wash when it's more ideal for them to be hand washed.

I think NAH, just different perspectives.\n\nPersonally, I think if a rental has like specific utensils that shouldn't be put in the dishwasher, it should be stated somewhere. On the agreement, on the washer, etc. It isn't like she took the wooden utensils and threw them away, broke them, etc. \n\nSo there really isn't any damage, any party foul - she just is on vacation and didn't want to go the extra mile. Unfortunately, they were yours, which she apologized about.", "ESH. Your mom didn't show respect for your belongings. Would she treat her own things that way? I think not from your message.\n\nOn the other hand, they were your items and you should have ensured they were taken care of appropriately. Sorry, lesson learned here.", "I agree, but I mean to be fair, at the prices AirBNB charges, I should be able to burn their furniture in the yard and still get my deposit back.

It seems like OP is just looking to create drama.", "Years ago I worked for a guy that had a little sign over his desk that said \"without profit there is no point\". And maybe I'll sound greedy, but that's true.  Why would I rent out my place for short term rental if I'm not going to make some kind of profit?  And if I have to keep fixing or replacing stuff at my place the margins just aren't there.\n\nThat being said I have had a few rare occasions where I'll let a return guest book a short stay at a rate where I'm just about breaking even.  It gives my cleaner a bit of work and a regular guest gets a spot they like.  But this is definitely the exception not the rule.\n\nYeah and as far as the cleaning fees go, it literally costs me $200 to clean my place.  I'm not making money off the cleaning fee, I'm just being upfront about where your money as a guest is going.", "As it should. A few GayCatDaddy tornados may also be appropriate.\n\nFuck it - add a few sharknados too.", "NOTHING IS SAID about these items being ruined. They survived just like all the other times guest put them through the dishwasher. \n\nDRAMA - why does everything need to be amped up? Wouldnt it be wiser for the family to enjoy the vacation they paid for and to use their time to show mutual support and understanding? No wonder people are having relationship problems.", "Definitely.  Not okay, for OP to fight with her mother about a hypothetical situation in which they would have belonged to a rando", "If you're paying someone $200 just to spot-clean a house between weekend guests, you aren't doing what you can to maximize profits. You could do the two hours worth of work yourself for the cost of materials. That's just being lazy and making it something the guest pays for. Which, if it works for you, go nuts! That's the beauty of the system for the hosts. But you can't possibly sit here and try to justify it to guests when they say it's stupid, because it *is* from that side. Nobody is faulting anybody for making a profit, and AirBNB hosts doing it right certainly aren't struggling in that department either; it's just funny that hosts are willing to pay exorbitant prices to just spot clean the house, and then try to tell guests it's 'barely breaking even'.", "Nah, the coating is removed and the mom will need to go through a thing to clean off any rust and then built up the coating again.\n\nYou need dynamite or a metal shredding machine to kill off cast iron.", "NTA. This is why you generally can't find nice knives etc at rentals. People like your mom ruin the experience for everyone and add to the throw-away mentality that makes our landfills grow and grow and grow.", "Why can't you put good knives into a dishwasher?", "NTA. I work in hospitality and you OP, are becoming the exception to the rule.

And too many do not respect things that aren\u2019t theirs.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA but your mom is and she sounds like an entitled, rude guest.", "Wow - just so much drama over very little.", "Same.", "It speeds up dulling the blade.", "if you have a problem with cost then don't fucking rent from them. just because you think it cost to much doesn't give you the right to disrespect the owners possessions.", "With that mindset she\u2019d probably be fine with shitting on the carpet too because she\u2019s paying a cleaning fee after all. And just like the utensils, the carpet can be washed but it\u2019ll never be quite the same again.", " We have wooden spoons we\u2019ve had for at least 20 years, and we never hand wash.  They are still fine/great.  If we ever needed new ones, they\u2019re super-cheap anyway.", ">if you have a problem with cost then don't fucking rent from them\n\nSimmer down, sweetie. I don't use AirBNB for this exact reason.\n\nAlso, I don't disrespect people's properties. \"I should be able to\" versus \"I do\" are two very different sentences.", "Unless the knife got chipped in the dishwasher, it's going to be fine. And you can run a wooden spoon through a dishwasher twice a week for a year or so before it'll start deteriorating.", "I didn't say I was barely breaking even.  I'm not going to clean the place myself it's 4 hours away from where I live.  And beyond that my place takes about 3-4 hours to clean. At the hourly rate I make at work it would be significantly more expensive than paying a cleaner.  I'm not going to try and pay somebody complete shit wages to do their job. \n\nThere's a reason so many places charge $200 for cleaning, that's the cost of labor. A hotel is able to bring that cost down by having a cleaning staff and typical rooms and supplies. Yeah cleaning an Airbnb is going to cost more.  But what you get from an Airbnb is typically different than what you get from a hotel.  When I travel I use both options depending where I'm going and what I'm looking for. If you think the prices are \"exorbitant\" then you don't have to use the service.", "Spot clean? My cleaner charges 180 to clean a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 2 living room, property, which includes all the laundry, the scrubbing of the bath, shower, toilets, sinks, cleaning all the mirrors and windows, cleaning the oven, the toaster, thr fridge, plus all the standard mopping, vacuuming and so on. It's not a \"spot clean\". It's a full deep clean every time.", "I don't get out of bed for less than $1k...\n\n$200 to clean a house seems more than reasonable to me. Stop acting like it's the 1980's. Wages are so depressed it's ridiculous and you think someone charging $200 for a few hours of work is too much...", "My new band name", "I'm not saying *you* are barely breaking even by any means, I don't know your financial situation, nor am I going to assume how well your AirBNB is doing for you. What I'm saying is that it is a common complaint for guests about exorbitant cleaning fees, and the common response from hosts is 'we're barely breaking even', which can't possibly be the case because nobody would be doing it anymore. And a $200 cleaning fee for a larger home is one thing, but a $200 cleaning fee for a small apartment is absurd. What I'm saying is that too many hosts who have the capacity to clean their spaces themselves choose not to do so because they want the 'no/low-effort, passive income' experience, but then wonder why people are dumbfounded by their insane prices coupled with exorbitant cleaning fees because they'd rather pay an inflated rate to barely clean their 900 square foot shoe box than go spend two hours doing it themselves. A $200 cleaning fee for a week-long stay in a larger, reasonably-priced home is very different from a $200 cleaning fee for a 2-night stay in a sardine can. $200 is just a number I put out for an example, as well.\n\nEven then, though, I know quite a few people who clean AirBNBs. Unless your home is huge and the place is trashed, they're making a killing off of you at $200 per visit. If I didn't have a screaming toddler with me all the time, I'd do it myself.\n\nEdit to add: Also, I don't use AirBNB anymore. I don't need to pay hotel prices for some host trying to pass off their damaged property on me because they're too cheap to fix it themselves, or trying to charge me for 'stealing utensils' when they're literally in the dishwasher they demanded I load. Also, if I'm paying a cleaning fee *anyway*, I'm not going to also clean the place up before I go. I'm not going to trash it, I'm not an animal, but I'm definitely not wiping things down just for the hosts to charge me $200 for someone to come in behind me with a swiffer to do *slightly* more than I just did for free.", "Then maybe leave short term rentals to hotels and resorts instead of hoarding houses?", "Then you've either gotten a steal of a price, or your cleaner is very much exaggerating what they're actually doing. Laundry and wiping visible surfaces, sure. Cleaning an oven? Probably not unless the guests have trashed it to a noticeable point. \n\nLike I said in another comment, $200 for a sizeable home like that is justifiable (hell, maybe even generous on the host's part). $200 for an apartment? Nope.", "I'm not saying the cleaner is charging too much for a few hours of work. I'm saying:\n\n(A) the work most AirBNB cleaners are doing isn't worth that much because almost every AirBNB host I've encountered makes the guest do most of that work for them before they leave anyway\n\n(B) Hosts who choose to use an expensive cleaning service rather than clean the place themselves can't feign surprise when people complain that the price is absurd, or be shocked nobody wants to rent from them", "LOL!!!", "Every once in a blue moon I'll get a guest that complains about the cleaning fee it's usually few and far between.  Those are also typically the worst and most demanding guests.  It is what it is.\n\nAll I can say is businesses with poor business models usually won't make it and consumers should abide by the old adages \"buyer beware\" and \"you get what you pay for.\" \n\nAs well as being a host I'm also a frequent guest at Airbnbs, with overall positive experiences.  I've also never stayed at any of these places I hear about on reddit with stringent check out instructions.  I think the most I've ever had to do is strip the beds.  I really think all these horror stories and stuff are really the minority, or maybe they're exclusive to the cheapest places in town or something.", "That's a ridiculous point of view.  Short term vacation rentals are a completely viable business model.  And if somehow you think that me, a working class individual who was able to save up enough to open an Airbnb, is somehow stealing or depriving resources from you that a giant hotel conglomerate would not be, then I think you've fallen for their propaganda.  \n\nThe town I own my Airbnb in is a vacation town that relies on tourist money to keep it's economy afloat.  Whole home rental has been a popular thing there decades before Airbnb showed up.  Do much to the hotel lobby and people convinced by their propaganda that Airbnbs were the cause of the rising prices in housing costs the town passed a pretty strict STR regulation.  Home prices continued to rise after that however.  The local economy did suffer some however due to less vacationers (they didn't all just come to stay at the hotels like locals thought they would instead)\n\nThere is almost no evidence supporting the theory that the rise in STRs is the driver in the housing price boom.", "How is a cleaner able to exaggerate when I see the before and after? I do agree with you about the price being different for a smaller space. Clearly it takes less time if there's only say 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. As I mentioned, my place is quite big and sleeps up to 10 people.", "(A) your anecdotal experience does not represent everyone's experience. I rent a home for 1 week each summer and have never had an unreasonable chore list. It is possible to avoid unreasonable hosts, let them figure out why they have a lack of business, something something invisible hand of the market place...\n\n(B) my kid has a better understanding of opportunity cost and the value of time than you do. Also how can you think that a cleaner charging $200 is ok, but the host passing that cost through to the renter is absurd? You are really trying to be on both sides of this argument at the same time...", "I'm glad you've had better experiences than I with AirBNBs, I've had some of the worst interactions of my life with them. Only tried it three times and two of them were nightmares. Weren't cheap places, either. Most of the stories I've heard from peers are similar in nature. Maybe thats just the norm with touristy areas, but I can't justify going back when I can guarantee less headache with a hotel.", "It's not hard to polish a messy environment. I can make my house look real pretty for pictures or even a walk through, but I definitely didn't do hours of work to get it there.", "(A) I've only spoken to my experience and what I know from others. I haven't at any point said this is fact\n\n(B) A cleaner can charge what they want. And a host doesn't have to pay that. There are people who will do it cheaper, or they can do it themselves. If your prices are so high that it should include a cleaning fee built in but you still charge X amount for a cleaning fee, people aren't going to be happy. I'm not on any side of any argument but my own", "Have you ever considered opening your own Airbnb?", "And as the owner, I can easily tell the difference.", "Not particularly interested in it, personally. All the headaches of homeownership with the added annoyance of dealing with both the general public AND the company on a regular basis? Not my cup of tea.", "If you're there in person, I'm sure you can. If you're like other people who are halfway across the country and only see pictures, then I'm sure your cleaners like that you think you can.", "NTA. With some of the AirB&B stories I've heard recently I'd expect the host family to charge an extra fee for damage to their property if the utensils she put through the dishwasher belonged to them. She should be considerate of **other people's property**, not just her relative's property.", "NTA but you are being a little dramatic", "Not putting wooden spoons in a dishwasher is fucking ridiculous. Its wood, not sugar. Water isn't going to hurt them. I've been putting my wooden spoons in the dishwasher for 16 years and they're still perfectly fine. The only damage they've suffered from the dishwasher is that time one of them fell off the rack and landed on the heating element.", "Stayed for 2 months at an AirBNB last spring.\n\ncompletely equipped kitchen, and teh owner actually went out and bought a new blender when the old one died.\n\nIt was like finding a unicorn -hosts were awesome, lived upstairs, no insane lists of rules and chores.\n\nAlso -her husband was an artist, and it turned out he knew a lot of my profs and contacts from Fine Art.", "Haha yep. Hell, I grew up with my parents using the same wooden spoons for 17 years and I'm sure they were around before I was born. They were nigh indestructible. Meanwhile I buy new ones now and treat them like glass only for the wood to start coming apart after a month like wtf are they putting in them, damn functional obsolescence.", "I guarantee you the fact they're 16+ years old contributes to this, they really don't make them like they used to and the old ones could stand up better to long term moisture exposure and use.", "Well thats sweet of her. Certainly not every AirBNB host is bad, but the ones that *are* taint the whole thing, and they're too common for my liking.", "My dude, these were $1 spoons I bought from Walmart when I first moved out. They're not special. \n\nWhen was the last time that you actually washed your wooden spoons? Are you saying that it's bad to wash them because you've had several sets degrade in the wash. Or are you just parroting what you were told without ever testing it?", "I've been doing that for 16 years and my wooden spoons are still fine. This seems like that old advice to not mix colors and whites when doing laundry. It used to be solid advice back in the day, but now it's useless because things aren't as shitty as they used to be.", "Your beef in this department isn't with the average person owning a second home for short-term rentals; it's with companies like Progress Residential who own 60,000 homes across the US and inflate the rent prices absurdly high because they know there's a shortage, and then leave their tenants with water leaking up through their floors."]}
