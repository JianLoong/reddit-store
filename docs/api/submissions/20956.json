It's important to communicate your expectations and preferences regarding the care of personal items, but it's also important to consider the intentions and perspectives of others.\n\nIn this situation, it doesn't necessarily make you the asshole for expecting your mother to treat strangers' belongings with the same care she would treat her own. However, it would be helpful to approach the conversation with understanding and seek a resolution through open communication and mutual respect.", "YTA why are you fighting with an apologetic 74 year old? That\u2019s like a unicorn.", "YTA, you brought stuff that shouldn\u2019t be put in the dishwasher and didn\u2019t tell anyone. \n\nIn the context of a vacation rental it is expected that everything can go in the dishwasher and without you telling other people about your special tools no one knew to treat them differently.", "YTA,  if you are in a rental you should assume that every utensil has been through the dishwasher multiple times. That is how rental customers do things.  So therefore you should assume that the rental owners are ok with it. \n\nIf you have items that require special care, perform that special care yourself. Or don\u2019t bring them out for use. No reason to assume that others will always without fail make the same decisions you would.", "YTA. If your that specific on how you want your items washed then you need to wash them yourself. When I\u2019m staying at an Air B&B I\u2019m assuming that items are dish washer safe.", "YTA. If they were good kitchen tools, you should\nhave kept an eye on them and ensure you had washed them yourself.

You were huffy for trying to continue getting mad about hypothetically situations in which the items belonged to a rando.  Let it go.", "YTA. I have stayed in multiple rentals, and everything there is put in dishwasher. In fact, that is preferred because the water is so hot that it  sanitizes the dishes.
