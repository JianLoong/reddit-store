My mom had the same rules for us growing up, yet somehow loaded 2 wooden utensils into our dishwasher and started it last time she was here \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA\n\nBravo OP! This is why some places won\u2019t provide nice things. If all people took care, then everyone would be taking care of each other and our things.", "NTA \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t matter whose belongings they are, it doesn\u2019t take much to put a little care into it. Washing a couple extra things isn\u2019t that big of a deal.", "NTA\n\nAnd pls tell your mom a stranger from the internet wants to tell her: \n\nThank you mrs ops mom, thank you very much. You are EXACTLY the kind of person who ruines everything for everybody else. Yes, you see no big deal in ruining your airbnbs host knives, but soon we all have to pay a fee for ruined stuff. You don't see a problem leaving your leftovers and garbage at the park, but now we all are not allowed to picknick there anymore and i could go on and on. Your behaviour is selfish and antisocial and you can not be shamed enough for your bad manners. 74 yrs old and still the maturity of a 12 yrs old, congratulations!", "NTA my grandparents and parents both instilled it in me that you take care of other peoples thing BETTER than you would treat your own! If you damage something of someone else\u2019s you replace it with same or better!", "NTA, I'd be bothered by knowing someone I looked up to as a parent or otherwise had that kind of mentality. It's a bit unsettling and rather individualistic. \"Screw anyone else but I would've taken care of the things if I knew they were yours.\" It's not that hard to be considerate, I don't understand why we have to maintain apathy for people or things unless we personally know or care about them.", " NTA Tell her that you\u2019re surprised at her, because she raised you better than that.", "NTA. It's not only good manners, but ethically good, to care for others as you want to be cared for (and this includes their things). \"I got mine\" is not a value I'd choose to live by (ie as long as I and my things are ok, who cares about others and their things). I'm glad you called your mum out on her disrespectful behaviour.", "NTA. These y t a people have never seen a good knife in their lives.", "NTA. Tbh, I wouldn\u2019t have known that. But the fact that she does and did it for the sole reason that it didn\u2019t belong to her and didn\u2019t realize it belonged to you is telling.", "NAH\n\nI mean, sure, you have a point, but so does she. Because when at a rental you:\n\nA) don't expect items to be a good or exoensive knife\n\nB) can fairly assume people already have been putting the items in the dishwasher anyway\n\nI think that is what she meant, were they yours, she'd know they were special AND well taken care of.", "I was tossing up between N A H and YTA but settled on the latter. You\u2019re in a rental property that is probably used exclusively as such. They provided a dishwasher for ease of use, and your mum used that appliance for its intended purpose.\n\nShe knew they wouldn\u2019t break, the dishwasher would not ruin them for someone else, and most likely every guest would put utensils like these in the dishwasher. I\u2019m not kitchen savvy, so I would have put them in the dishwasher not knowing I wasn\u2019t supposed to.\n\nThe only thing that would have changed it to N A H is if you were just upset that she did that to your utensils, which you would have been allowed to be a little upset about as it\u2019s always annoying and that initial reaction is normal.\n\nHowever, when finding out she was willing to \u2018damage\u2019 the equipment in the rental and being upset about that instead, means you need to relax.

Leave them soaking overnight, or run them through the dishwasher (especially without the heated-dry function)", "Jeez, brutal... But fair.", "How can there be mutual respect when the mom's mentality of apathy unless otherwise informed prevents such? \"If I knew they were yours I wouldn't have ruined them\" like really....", "Who happened to act like a rude, selfish hypocrite.", "Except mom knows that knives and wooden utensils don't go in the dishwasher.  This wasn't about some gadget she'd never seen before. Why would you treat a stranger's things differently than you do your own?", "To clarify my response. I was a butcher for years and our butcher shop also did catering as long as it didn't interfere with our busy season. Our knives were ALWAYS hand cleaned with special cleanser. We didn't use wooden utensils for catering but due to my job I took food safety courses and culinary classes. Wooden utensils can lose their natural oil after 4 or 5 times in the dishwasher. They also are more likely to cause scratches on your pans. The life span of wooden utensils is greatly diminished by using a dishwasher.", "My boyfriend has his own set of knives for this exact reason. No way in hell he'll touch my knives. Because if they end up in the dishwasher he'll have to replace them all. And he hates hand washing anything. So he uses his knives, which are horrible because they go in the dishwasher every day. And I have my knives, which I handwash. Works. \nBut even he wouldn't throw someone else's knives in the dishwasher.\nHe did accidentally ruin my set of wooden spoons, because he didn't know how horrible the dishwasher would treat them. He was really surprised they were ten years old, and within a couple of months looked permanently gross and felt \"soggy\".", "I absolutely love your response!!!", "It's a 74 year-old person though, they get flustered easily, especially when you come on them strongly.

Hell my hubby left one of my brand new wooden spoons overnight in the sink and it wasn't even sitting in water but was ruined. They don't make 'em like they used to.", "I'm a 71-years-old woman,  and I take exception to your statement that the 74-years-old woman would be easily flustered.   What a ridiculous assumption to make!\n\nOP's mother was wrongety wrong.  OP is NTA.", "The women in their 70s (and 80s and 90s) that I worked with in a local community garden would laugh in your face at the idea that people in their 70s \"get flustered easily\" just because of their age. \n\nGetting flustered is more of a personality thing, not an age thing. Nothing OP wrote sounded in any way like their mother was flustered, she just didn't give a crap about someone else's stuff.", "Yeah. No way. Neither my parents, nor my in-laws get \"flustered\" when I ask them strongly to do or not do something. They are all way over the 74y.o. mark.", "The old ones could be used to tan my rear. A lot of them now of days can't stir anything that is too thick. You can actually find some really good ones if you do the research and you are willing to pay the money for an artisanal product.", "Ma'am, I'm glad that you're in great health and I apologise if the statement/assumption has offended you. There are people I know around this age that gets flustered easily and needed to be treated gently (hence the generalization- still a mistake tho).
