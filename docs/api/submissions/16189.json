You outright told him you wouldn't keep secrets for him, if he's stupid enough to tell you that's on him.  Your dad can go eat rocks, I'd be proud of my daughter for having good morals.

Pretty sure you have to do it at sign on but you can make it so you can access pretty much anything on another person's phone if you're the one paying the bill. This is worrying in its own right if that is indeed the case.", "he tried to talk to his ex gf and everyone that told her what has ever happened she took screenshots as evidence and sent them to him", "all he did after cheating was hang out with a bunch of girls and i told her some things he did while he was in the relationship with her", "No i\u2019ll definitely apologize no matter what. i had no intention of telling her but she asked so i had no intention of holding back", "ik him and he will be over this in a week. but i didn\u2019t insert myself. she asked me for information so i told her", "she asked me what happened and for info so i told her. i had no intention of telling her if she didn\u2019t ask", "i\u2019ll still apologize and i had no intention of telling her but she asked so i told her", "she messaged me asking what happened and i told her. i told my brother i would snitch because he has cheated on all his past girlfriends and needs to learn a lesson.", "his ex girl friend had texted me and asked for everything i knew so i told her. i understand if im the Ah", "i didnt go out of my way because i wasn\u2019t going to tell her but she asked. and her and i were friends", "Why apologize?

You're doin great by sticking with your morals and telling the truth. We need more people like you in this world.", "Let it be a lesson learned then.

Do you think if someone asked your step brother something about you that you don't think should be shared, he should give them the information just becaused they asked him???\n\nYou say he will be over this in a week which makes me think you must do things to him all the time that he gets over.", "YTA, and you\u2019re doubling down on it. You inserted yourself. You could have stopped yourself at \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened\u201d, and you clearly premeditated ratting him out.

People need better morals, wtf.", "OP, you are so not the AH. If I were you I would have done the same thing and possibly even told her about the cheating before they broke up cuz that just ain't right. Being cheated on sucks hard and if I were that girl I would have wanted to know if my bf was cheating too, even after a breakup. STIs are more rampant than we think, you just never fucking know. People saying you should have minded your own business are probably cheaters and/or have very little empathy towards people who have been cheated on. I for one agree with the fact that your brother needs to learn a lesson.

She waited till the relationship was over to pour salt in the wound. YTA.", "Regardless it would explain the origin of the screenshots pretty well.", "Ok yeah I forgot it said that. That's a short time to get a single phone plan. So either they jumped into that really quick or she sent the screenshots. I mean he could have installed something into her phone to keep track of her as well but it seems less likely than a shared plan.", "no i\u2019m straight he just is a compulsive cheater", "Then what are you saying?", "Naah this wasn't no \"pouring salt on the wound\". The ex gf knew he cheated, hence why shes an ex. She was probably reaching out to OP for clarification and info for closure.", "You\u2019re reaching reaaaaaaaaally hard", "The ex gf forwarded the screenshots as proof according to the OP. You can give the conjecture a break- the ex did it.", "I\u2019m saying when people start contradicting themselves between the post and the follow up responses, they are usually TA. \n\nIf she was going to inform the girlfriend what her brother was like, she should\u2019ve done so earlier in the relationship, not wait until after the breakup to unload a bunch of gossip like he was hanging out with some girls after the breakup. \n\nShe didn\u2019t know anything about the actual cheating in this instance until the brother told her after the breakup, so there was nothing she had to lie about to protect the brother. \n\nWhen I said \u201cNo\u201d to the previous post it was because it was entirely tangential to my previous statement.", "So I gotta ask. Why is this particular point a sore spot? And it's no more if a each than any other theory. Sheesh calm down.", "Omg. Mystery solved then. That's a relief."]}
