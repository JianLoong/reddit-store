My mom married my step father about 3 years ago, he has a daughter Emma (17F).\n\nI've been incessantly bullied by Emma and her side of the family (small town, everyone knows each other) because of my mixed race background, and that my dad's side are not wealthy. My dad passed away when I was a lot younger. So Emma and I do not get along at all.\n\nThis family heirloom (a bracelet) has been in Emma's mother's side of the family for 5 or 6 generations and has been passed down from mother to first daughter. It's not valuable financially, it's not made of gold and has no precious stones. The value is mostly sentimental. Emma was NOT in line to receive this, as she has an older sister Ava.\n\nThere have been tension between Emma and her mom because Emma believed she should get this heirloom as Ava has a drug addiction problem and Emma believed Ava would not take good care of this. However in the end their mom gave it to Ava.\n\nA couple of weeks ago Ava pawned the bracelet at a pawn shop which my friend works there. He noticed Ava pawned a bracelet and knew about the bracelet so he gave me a call and told me what happened. I went there and bought it for myself. I didn't tell anyone and am keeping it at my uncle's house with my cousin.\n\nOnce Emma learned the bracelet has been pawned she went there to buy it but as I had already bought it they came back empty handed and Emma has been complaining about this (and Ava) NON STOP. She does not know that I have it.\n\nI can end it by telling her that I have it and offer to give (or sell) it to her but I'm keeping it for myself because why not. It's mine as I've purchased it legitimately. She's been racist to me and I don't need to do her a favor.

So Emma and I do not get along at all.\n\nThis family heirloom (a bracelet) has been in Emma's mother's side of the family for 5 or 6 generations and has been passed down from mother to first daughter. It's not valuable financially, it's not made of gold and has no precious stones. The value is mostly sentimental. Emma was NOT in line to receive this, as she has an older sister Ava.\n\nThere have been tension between Emma and her mom because Emma believed she should get this heirloom as Ava has a drug addiction problem and Emma believed Ava would not take good care of this. However in the end their mom gave it to Ava.\n\nA couple of weeks ago Ava pawned the bracelet at a pawn shop which my friend works there. He noticed Ava pawned a bracelet and knew about the bracelet so he gave me a call and told me what happened. I went there and bought it for myself. I didn't tell anyone and am keeping it at my uncle's house with my cousin.\n\nOnce Emma learned the bracelet has been pawned she went there to buy it but as I had already bought it they came back empty handed and Emma has been complaining about this (and Ava) NON STOP. She does not know that I have it.\n\nI can end it by telling her that I have it and offer to give (or sell) it to her but I'm keeping it for myself because why not.
