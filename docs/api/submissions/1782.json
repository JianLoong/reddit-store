Thank you for holding the boundary for your daughter.", "NTA\n\nYou are protecting and looking out for your child.

My child is learning to drive and during a lesson with me in a parking lot last week, she mixed up the brake and gas and hit a stop sign with my car's side mirror, causing 4 figures of damage to my car.  I was upset of course.  But I didn't yell at her. Because it was an accident.  She didn't do anything wrong, she just made a mistake, something that every single one of us does now and then.

I\u2019m sure your mother still sees both of you as children and all that BS, but at the end of the day, the things she says and the way she says them to a 7 year-old are despicable and disgusting. No matter what the circumstance.", "Info: did she yell AT her or as a reaction to soup being spilled?", "Everyone is an asshole- your mom - obviously.\n\nBut you - you have a 7 year old who is having extremely obvious signs of anxiety and mental health issues, and you just tell people to be careful with her?\n\nYour kid needs help, and you are an asshole for not getting it.", "ESH. You really should learn to handle conflicts without screaming.", "INFO: did your mother yell AT your daughter, or did she yell out of surprise? Obviously your daughter is going to react either way because she\u2019s 7 and sensitive to noise. But it makes a difference in how you should respond to your mother. If she yelled AT your daughter, that\u2019s something that needs dealt with. If she let out a noise of surprise, that\u2019s as out of her control as your daughter dropping the bowl was out of your daughter\u2019s control. Things happen. \n\nAlso, there would have been another loud sound in the mix\u2014the bowl breaking. Since your daughter is sensitive to ALL loud sounds, I don\u2019t think your mom would have had to be that loud for your daughter to react. A surprised yelp on the heels of the sound of a bowl breaking could easily be enough to cause a reaction, from how you describe your daughter\u2019s sensitivity to noise. Heck, sometimes it takes me a few minutes to calm down after I hear something drop and break, and I\u2019m nowhere near as sensitive to noise as your daughter.\n\nIt was definitely not okay if your mom yelled AT your daughter. Never, never, never, whether the child was sensitive to noise or not. But sometimes people make noises in surprise, you know? My mother lets out a horrifying shriek if a spider surprises her, it\u2019s involuntary.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m not a fan of your reaction of yelling at your mother in turn. Good that you got the daughter out of the stress location. Good to address the situation with your mother. Bad to address the issue with mom by screaming at her in turn. Adults should not be getting into screaming matches. Especially with a vulnerable child in the mix. Although I\u2019m more than willing to accept that your daughter couldn\u2019t hear any of that from the car and she was safely out of the splash zone, as it were.\n\nThe bigger issue is that if that\u2019s in your toolkit of problem solving, you need to get some better tools. The more you rely on a tool, the more easily it will come to hand. Habits are a matter of practice and consistency. If you\u2019re in the habit of screaming at people,  that\u2019s something to think about and work on. That can\u2019t be your go-to method of conflict resolution. It has its place: toddler in oncoming traffic, just saw a bomb in the road, person driving a tractor didn\u2019t see a pedestrian, just saw a wild animal and want to scare it away. Anything along those lines.\n\nAnd I definitely get that you\u2019re upset. Your daughter is sitting in a corner, clearly reacting  to something your mother did, regardless of your mother\u2019s intent. That is upsetting! That\u2019s valid!\n\nStill not a reason to start yelling. If your mother yelled at your daughter on purpose (as opposed to an involuntary reaction), it\u2019s time to lay down rules with your mother as another adult. No more unsupervised time for a while. Family therapy. Definitely an apology from your mother to your daughter. If your mom won\u2019t do what you need her to do, that\u2019s her problem. And that\u2019s not an exhaustive list of your options, obviously, but the idea is to take action to reinforce the rules to your mother and let your daughter know everything is okay. Yelling won\u2019t accomplish that. If your mother won\u2019t talk to you without yelling, that\u2019s on her\u2014your move is to tell her you won\u2019t engage while she\u2019s behaving like that, take your daughter, and leave. \n\nSome of the best advice I ever got is to always be the most reasonable person in the room. They were talking about jury trials, but it\u2019s not a bad life philosophy, either. In my experience, people respond to that attitude by either escalating to get a reaction (in which case, you make it clear you won\u2019t play that game and stop engaging), or they calm down to your level (and you can talk with them as rational adults).\n\nI have one other question: what did your mother do after the incident? Did she apologize to your daughter and try to calm her down? Did she follow whatever methods you have to soothe your daughter after something like this triggers her? It sounds like she didn\u2019t do anything at all, which is a huge issue regardless of what her intent was. If she yelled as a reprimand, she should have apologized and soothed immediately (or as soon as possible, if your daughter needs time to settle before being approached). If it was involuntary, she \u2026 well, again it should have been an apology and soothing actions, it\u2019s just that the content of the apology would be different. Instead of \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it was wrong of me to yell at you and it wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d it would be more like \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you, I reacted badly because I was startled. It wasn\u2019t your fault and I was NOT yelling at you. Sometimes adults respond to noises too.\u201d Or something else that makes it clear that no one is mad, daughter is safe in the environment, and your mom is still a safe person to be around.\n\nAnyway. If your mom yelled as an involuntary reaction AND tried to apologize and comfort your daughter, Y T A. If she yelled as a reprimand OR (inclusive) didn\u2019t try to comfort your daughter, E S H (except for your daughter, obviously).", "NTA at all. But have you ever had your daughter evaluated for autism or sensory processing disorder? My sons and I are all autistic and sensory issues are very common. For my oldest son it's loud noises. He's in high school and thanks to being diagnosed he has an IEP at school that allows him to be able to step out of a classroom if it gets loud and he starts getting overwhelmed. \n\nIf you're in the US, public schools have people on staff that can do evaluations. Doctors recommend going that route first because it's free and then it opens the door to a specialist and gets your child the resources they need in school. \n\nAn ASD diagnosis does not mean your kid gets stuck in Spec Ed classes either. It just means the school will inform their teachers and work with you to make a plan to help them thrive in class. My oldest is in highschool and taking dual credit courses but without his IEP he probably would have struggled too much to even function in classes. \n\nLook into getting your daughter evaluated and keep her away from your mom until your mom is educated on the issue and can keep her temper under control.", "NTA.

I don't do well with being yelled at, never have.  \ud83d\ude14", "Clearly the mother never learned the saying \u201cno point crying over spilt milk\u201d", "Except for when cats spill things, then it is never an accident\n\nAll jokes aside, clear NTA, please keep standing up for your kid OP!", "Talk about crying over spilt milk... I mean soup...", "NTA. I agree with the NC", "She could be autistic and/or something could have happened that impacted her early in childhood that OP is unaware of. IMO, the child sounds severely traumatized, with the shaking and stimming. Regardless, she definitely needs professional support.", "i think, to the child it wouldn't have mattered.", "You can still punish your child without yelling. For example, a stern talking to would be an alternative to yelling. \n\nAnd why should people get yelled at in general? Except for dangerous and/or generally loud situations, yelling is just a showcase for your poor communication skills and emotional regulation. \n\nIt's not even preperation for adult life, because most adults don't use yelling to reprimand you (barring special circumstances like military). And in my experience, those who do also do it for the most stupid things. Like a teacher of mine who yelled at me, a minor at the time, because my father wouldn't send over the money for a school trip. Apparently it was my job to walk him through the process, when I didn't even know how it works (especially because of the paperwork because we were below the poverty line and got financial aid).\n\nAnd I want to note that I'm like that girl, only that I'm an adult and can handle it a bit better now but still not well. Also have a partner who also had a problem with loud noices as a child. So yelling didn't work with both of us and we are still very functioning adults, who can communicate without yelling.", "Tell me when I said she doesn\u2019t get help?", "If someone has a strong physical reaction to loud noises therapy isn't going to make that disappear.", "Did she never lose her temper like this when you were a kid? If not, then either she's having problems with hormone changes from menopause or there's something else going on with her. Either way, she needs to regulate her reactions. \n\nAlso, you don't mention specifically getting your daughter therapy that will help her cope with her (possible) sensory processing disorder, but if you're not getting her therapy for it I would strongly advise it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. By the way, when I was about your daughter\u2019s age, I was diagnosed with hyperacusis, a hearing disorder regarding loudness of sound. It might be worth your while to look into.", "Intent definitely matters though as far as OPs reaction.", "Do you think your mom''s mistreatment of your daughter has to do with her father's relationship with your sister?", "This makes me wonder if it was a surprise sound rather than a full shout. \n\nIm sorry the kid is now way put off from being around Gma. One incident ruined it.", "There are so many things this could be (anxiety disorder, sensory processing disorder, on the spectrum).\n\nI've had chronic headaches my whole life (I apparently started telling my parents about them when I was 4-5 but that's probably when I figured out how to vocalize it). Nobody believes a small child when they say they have headaches all the time. People \\*do\\* believe children when they cry and are afraid. It was easier to get adults to do something about it by crying than telling them what was happening.", "That's a possibility", "Possibly, but there are so so many things that can cause children to be averse to loud noises. There really isn\u2019t enough information to even speculate here.", "It depends if it\u2019s a physical reaction or a fear/anxiety reaction", "I agree in the sense that the two adults should determine if it was surprise/frustration or yelling directly at the child. But to the child, who has a problem with yelling, it won't make a difference. Mom only saw the results of GMa's reaction and went momma bear on her.", "Which depending on what happened could make OP an asshole. \n\nNo one is saying the child was wrong for reacting the way she did. The question is whether OP is the AH for their reaction. \n\nIf OPs mom cried out in surprise at a dropped bowl of soup and OP lost it on her, then OP is TA. If her mom shoulder at her daughter for dropping the soup, then the mom is TA.", ">Those are not weighted the same\n\nThe comment you replied to clearly said:\n\n>  It's not as bad as screaming at a child, especially one with sensory issues\n\nThey didn't say they were weighted the same. They just said you can solve this issue without screaming at someone.", "I agree, but I also understand the knee jerk reaction to seeing her daughter a puddle. Whatever happened, it scared the daughter enough to not want to go back again. \n\nI guess it's hard to really make a call since we don't really know what level of loud sets the daughter off. If it's minor noises, then it would be hard to never upset her. If it's legit loud noises, then I would suggest that GMa's possible suprise/frustration repose could have been over the top for daughters comfort level. OP doesn't really say so it's hard to know for sure how to land.", "So OPs mom can\u2019t have an involuntary surprise reaction but OP can have a knee jerk reaction?\n\nI can understand how OP could overreact to her mom in the moment, but it would still make her TA on that situation and she would still owe her mom an apology.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the scenario though and OP has not clarified.", "I guess I'm sort of projecting a little. I had a family member who overreacted to things (like the spilling of soup/breaking the bowl). She would go over the top and get everyone worked up for nothing. I get the feelling that there's more to the story but we don't have that so I'm trying not to put too much on either OP or GMa. At least I'm trying not to. \n\nMy initial comment was solely directed at the daughters reaction. But you are right, the conflict between OP and GMa is what is being judged and we really don't have enough info."]}
