It makes it even worse that she yelled over spilt soup. Kids spill things, adult spill things, and it\u2019s always an accident. No one should be berated for that. \n\nI don\u2019t want to overstep but I would also suggest having your daughter in some sort of therapy to work through this, as you won\u2019t always be around to protect her from yelling. Wishing you both the best", "NTA!\n\nWhat is wrong with your mom?? She is a CHILD! Getting mad over a 7 year old for accidentally breaking a bowl? Gotta get her temper checked out- There are other ways to explain it to a child that she has done wrong instead of just yelling at her. Good job for standing up for your kid\ud83d\udc4c", "Nta. Your mom can\u2019t handle children. She\u2019s still emotionally a child herself. Supervised visits only, if that from now on. Personally that would have been the last time she saw my child.", "NTA. A kid with such a known reaction should be handled carefully. Also, all this fuss because of spilling soup and breaking a bowl?   \nI sincerely hope your daughter is ok and that you can give her professional treatment. She's most probably autistic and need support and therapy to learn how to cope with it.", "NTA.  It wasn't until I was an adult that I learned screaming at a child for a pure accident is abusive.  Thank you for holding the boundary for your daughter.", "NTA\n\nYou are protecting and looking out for your child. Your mother needs to understand that a bowl of soup or a carpet isn't more important than her grandchilds well being. \n\nShe needs to either learn how to control her temper, or stop seeing your child.", "NTA. \n\nBut if you have to remind your mother not to scream at a child, and if your mother's temper is this fragile she is not a safe choice to look after your daughter.", "NTA. So, she agrees? That screaming at someone makes you an asshole? \ud83e\udd14 Fascinating. If she can\u2019t take it, maybe she shouldn\u2019t dish it to a literal child.", "Of course NTA and your Mom lost her chance with your daughter. She did damage that won't easily be repaired. She brought this on herself. Sucks you won't have an aid when it comes to watching over your child, but she needs to be safe first and foremost.", "ESH.  It sounds like you come by your screaming at people for their wrong doing honestly. \n\nYour mom had no business screaming at her granddaughter for what was,  essentially, an accident.  And you're certainly within your rights to end your mom's visits with your daughter as a consequence.  But what did it gain anyone for you to scream at your mother?", "Since your mom knew she shouldn't yell at your daughter, NTA.\n\nBut tactically, it was a bad, bad move, since it didn't accomplish anything. Just don't let your mom see your daughter until your daughter is comfortable with this.", "ESH - You screamed at your mom for screaming at your daughter? Do you see the irony? I think you both need therapy to address how you express yourselves during conflict.", "NTA. Who tf in their right mind yells at a 7y/o?", "IMO, NTA\n\nKids break things, shit happens. They make new bowls every day, and I know food is expensive but, it was an accident. She shouldn't have yelled at your daughter, it really wasn't warranted. I still break things, and I live with my bf. He doesn't yell at me, we just make do with what isn't broken. You're mom could have done the same, or had a conversation with you about it, instead of yelling at your daughter.", "NTA. If it's perfectly fine for her to yell at a 7yo, it's perfectly fine for you to yell at a grown woman. She shouldn't dish it out if she can't take it.\n\n(Sidenote: You already probably have but taking your daughter to a therapist in case she has sensory issues or an underlying condition/etc. might be a good idea.)\n\nWait I just did the maths you gave birth when you were 15?? Wow", "NTA\n\nI am old and still break things.\n So what, that's the reason dishes are to this days still produced/sold \ud83d\ude0e\nKeep your daughter safe", "NTA. Hope your mom only gets supervised visits from now on.", "You defended your child from somebody who was harming her wellbeing, of course you are NTA. Children drop and break things, it's part of the territory. It's why most children's stuff is plastic, not glass. It's bad enough yelling at a child for something even when they don't have the issues your daughter does.\n\nYour mother needs to take a hard look at her behaviour if she hope to ever see your daughter again.", "NTA. Don\u2019t scream at children, simple as. Don\u2019t leave them alone together again.", "NTA. Generally I think most points can be made without yelling, but she yelled at a child over a literal accident. After being told that was a clear boundary not to cross. \n\nNoise canceling earplugs. Some of them have a cute style to them. Feel free to ignore this unsolicited suggestion but, they make earplugs that dampens/filters external sounds (as opposed to completely blocking) that may help when your daughter gets overwhelmed by noise. They don\u2019t create noise, just block some of it so it\u2019s not so overwhelming. The brand I\u2019m thinking of are Loop, but I\u2019m sure there are others.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother was given instructions and she didn't follow them. She's essentially traumatised and burned a bridge with your daughter over a bowl of soup. That's not a good reason to yell in the first place, let alone at a child who appears to have hyper sensitivity to sounds. It was an accident made made by a literal child, what good is roaring going to do?\n\nThe fact that your mother called you a Major AH when she's the one who caused the issue should tell you all you need to know. Unless she recognises that she was the one who caused the issue and apologises to you and your daughter, you should not have her around your child. If she gives you further grief just make it very clear she chose a bowl of liquid food over her own grand daughter.  \n\n\nEDIT: If the reason people are downvoting me is because of me saying that the grandmother caused the issue, when the kid dropped a bowl of soup, you need to get your head checked. A child is not responsible for an adult shouting at them regardless of what it is. They are a child.", "NTA, my Mom isn't allowed to yell at my 17 year old. She did once and I gave her hell. I told her she was a grown a$$ adult and if she couldn't control herself, she didn't need to hang out with her grandchild.", "YTA the kid needs to toughen up", "Wait but, it dosnt sound healthy that your daughter even has problems with louder music??\nDid you look into getting her help? finding whats causing those problems with noises?\n\nYoure 22 your daughter is 7 so you got you kid with 15? seems like also your still a child at some extend which would explain you screaming at her back.\nSounds like both of you dont know how to talk like adults.\nESH", "ESH. Your mum definitely needed to be reminded that shouting at your kid, for an accident, wasn't on. But...we're all human and we all lose our shit sometimes-exactly like you did in this situation. It just seems a bit odd to reprimand someone for shouting by screaming at them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But still, that better be a very damn good reason to yell AND fail to apologize or comfort her scared granddaughter. You did nothing bad, OP.", "OP was angry with an adult who created an unsafe environment for her child. The Grandmother was angry about a bowl of soup. Those are not weighted the same and playing devils advocate for the grandmother feels a bit disingenuous. The only communication the grandmother understands as angry is shouting and screaming so that's what the mother did. She's not the asshole here because she retaliated when her childs safety was compromised when instructions were explicitly laid out for the grandmother."]}
