My child is learning to drive and during a lesson with me in a parking lot last week, she mixed up the brake and gas and hit a stop sign with my car's side mirror, causing 4 figures of damage to my car.

I\u2019m sure your mother still sees both of you as children and all that BS, but at the end of the day, the things she says and the way she says them to a 7 year-old are despicable and disgusting. No matter what the circumstance.", "Info: did she yell AT her or as a reaction to soup being spilled?", "Everyone is an asshole- your mom - obviously.\n\nBut you - you have a 7 year old who is having extremely obvious signs of anxiety and mental health issues, and you just tell people to be careful with her?\n\nYour kid needs help, and you are an asshole for not getting it.", "ESH. You really should learn to handle conflicts without screaming.", "INFO: did your mother yell AT your daughter, or did she yell out of surprise? Obviously your daughter is going to react either way because she\u2019s 7 and sensitive to noise. But it makes a difference in how you should respond to your mother. If she yelled AT your daughter, that\u2019s something that needs dealt with. If she let out a noise of surprise, that\u2019s as out of her control as your daughter dropping the bowl was out of your daughter\u2019s control. Things happen. \n\nAlso, there would have been another loud sound in the mix\u2014the bowl breaking. Since your daughter is sensitive to ALL loud sounds, I don\u2019t think your mom would have had to be that loud for your daughter to react. A surprised yelp on the heels of the sound of a bowl breaking could easily be enough to cause a reaction, from how you describe your daughter\u2019s sensitivity to noise. Heck, sometimes it takes me a few minutes to calm down after I hear something drop and break, and I\u2019m nowhere near as sensitive to noise as your daughter.\n\nIt was definitely not okay if your mom yelled AT your daughter. Never, never, never, whether the child was sensitive to noise or not. But sometimes people make noises in surprise, you know? My mother lets out a horrifying shriek if a spider surprises her, it\u2019s involuntary.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m not a fan of your reaction of yelling at your mother in turn. Good that you got the daughter out of the stress location. Good to address the situation with your mother. Bad to address the issue with mom by screaming at her in turn. Adults should not be getting into screaming matches. Especially with a vulnerable child in the mix. Although I\u2019m more than willing to accept that your daughter couldn\u2019t hear any of that from the car and she was safely out of the splash zone, as it were.\n\nThe bigger issue is that if that\u2019s in your toolkit of problem solving, you need to get some better tools. The more you rely on a tool, the more easily it will come to hand. Habits are a matter of practice and consistency. If you\u2019re in the habit of screaming at people,  that\u2019s something to think about and work on. That can\u2019t be your go-to method of conflict resolution. It has its place: toddler in oncoming traffic, just saw a bomb in the road, person driving a tractor didn\u2019t see a pedestrian, just saw a wild animal and want to scare it away. Anything along those lines.\n\nAnd I definitely get that you\u2019re upset. Your daughter is sitting in a corner, clearly reacting  to something your mother did, regardless of your mother\u2019s intent. That is upsetting! That\u2019s valid!\n\nStill not a reason to start yelling. If your mother yelled at your daughter on purpose (as opposed to an involuntary reaction), it\u2019s time to lay down rules with your mother as another adult. No more unsupervised time for a while. Family therapy. Definitely an apology from your mother to your daughter. If your mom won\u2019t do what you need her to do, that\u2019s her problem. And that\u2019s not an exhaustive list of your options, obviously, but the idea is to take action to reinforce the rules to your mother and let your daughter know everything is okay. Yelling won\u2019t accomplish that. If your mother won\u2019t talk to you without yelling, that\u2019s on her\u2014your move is to tell her you won\u2019t engage while she\u2019s behaving like that, take your daughter, and leave. \n\nSome of the best advice I ever got is to always be the most reasonable person in the room. They were talking about jury trials, but it\u2019s not a bad life philosophy, either. In my experience, people respond to that attitude by either escalating to get a reaction (in which case, you make it clear you won\u2019t play that game and stop engaging), or they calm down to your level (and you can talk with them as rational adults).\n\nI have one other question: what did your mother do after the incident? Did she apologize to your daughter and try to calm her down? Did she follow whatever methods you have to soothe your daughter after something like this triggers her? It sounds like she didn\u2019t do anything at all, which is a huge issue regardless of what her intent was. If she yelled as a reprimand, she should have apologized and soothed immediately (or as soon as possible, if your daughter needs time to settle before being approached). If it was involuntary, she \u2026 well, again it should have been an apology and soothing actions, it\u2019s just that the content of the apology would be different. Instead of \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it was wrong of me to yell at you and it wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d it would be more like \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you, I reacted badly because I was startled. It wasn\u2019t your fault and I was NOT yelling at you. Sometimes adults respond to noises too.\u201d Or something else that makes it clear that no one is mad, daughter is safe in the environment, and your mom is still a safe person to be around.\n\nAnyway. If your mom yelled as an involuntary reaction AND tried to apologize and comfort your daughter, Y T A. If she yelled as a reprimand OR (inclusive) didn\u2019t try to comfort your daughter, E S H (except for your daughter, obviously).", "NTA at all. But have you ever had your daughter evaluated for autism or sensory processing disorder? My sons and I are all autistic and sensory issues are very common. For my oldest son it's loud noises. He's in high school and thanks to being diagnosed he has an IEP at school that allows him to be able to step out of a classroom if it gets loud and he starts getting overwhelmed. \n\nIf you're in the US, public schools have people on staff that can do evaluations. Doctors recommend going that route first because it's free and then it opens the door to a specialist and gets your child the resources they need in school. \n\nAn ASD diagnosis does not mean your kid gets stuck in Spec Ed classes either. It just means the school will inform their teachers and work with you to make a plan to help them thrive in class. My oldest is in highschool and taking dual credit courses but without his IEP he probably would have struggled too much to even function in classes. \n\nLook into getting your daughter evaluated and keep her away from your mom until your mom is educated on the issue and can keep her temper under control.", "NTA.

Kids spill stuff sometimes, it is not worth yelling about.", "nta and your daughter sounds autistic", "You might have been an 'asshole' but note she called you one because you yelled at her the same way she yelled at your daughter.\n\nI don't think you should have yelled at your mother. But she definitely should not have yelled at your daughter. \n\nWho she won't be seeing much of in the near future.", "My cousin dropped a bowl of spaghetti when he was younger and my mom still laughs about that story. \nChildren drop and spill things, that's totally normal.

Please read this with an open mind. It may be difficult, but please try for the sake of your kid. I do want to note that this comment is assuming you are taking the neurotypical centric route of dealing with sensory issues. If you have taken more Neurodivergent created/ friendly approaches, then there is likely stuff here you can disregard. \n\nI would stop looking at her struggles with noise as fear and anxiety. They are not that and treating it as though it is won\u2019t help long term, and can cause harm.\n\nWhat she is experiencing is sensory overwhelm. Loud noises aren\u2019t scary, they are painful. There is a good chance she\u2019s experiencing something similar to physical pain when she hears loud noises. Any fear she has is secondary, she\u2019s afraid of the pain. \n\nTrying to \u201cget her used to\u201d loud noises is basically exposing her to this pain over and over again and expecting her to not react. It will do psychological damage. \n\nIn addition, by treater her pain as anxiety, you are likely doing something akin to gaslighting. (Not truly gaslighting, but I don\u2019t know a better word to use to describe this). Basically, you are trying to teach her that loud noises are nothing to be afraid of and she doesn\u2019t need to worry. But that\u2019s not true, they are painful, and that\u2019s scary. \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend seeking out autistic creators online and listening to their experiences and advice for dealing with this. As other commenters have said, noise canceling headphones can go a long way! Try to accommodate her rather than force her to fit a neurotypical standard. \n\nIn short, learn from people like your daughter what she is experiencing and how to help her. Neurotypicals think they know best how to help us but they really don\u2019t.", "Thank you I will most definitely check him out \ud83d\ude0a", "Thank you so much for this it truly does help me understand why she feels like this and I will definitely seek out other autistic people to help me understand even more.", "Yelling out to protect a kid from danger isn't the same thing as \"yelling at them\" because you're angry/as punishment.", "My son was 3 1/2 or 4 when he first told me his head hurt. I asked him when it started hurting and he looked very confused and told me his head always hurt, it was just worse that day. Took him to my chiropractor, which helped some, mentioned it to his doc who didn\u2019t really take it seriously, and brought it up with his dentist who said it was possible something oral was involved, but he couldn\u2019t see anything definitive. The chiropractor was able to help the most and kept him from having constant headaches. \n\nThen when he was 5 I had him evaluated by an orthodontist because he lost 4 top teeth at once and when the first 2 came in there was no room for the other two teeth. Turns out he needed braces at FIVE including head gear, IIRC, to correct his upper palate. Two weeks after starting braces his headache went away.", "NTA, but you will be if you don\u2019t get your daughter some help for her anxiety.", "Fuck no, your moms an asshole", "NTA.
