She lives somewhere. They could go there\n\nThis is a problem he created. He needs to find a solution since he can't follow your rules.", "bro shouldn't be making babies when he can't even afford a roof over his own head.\n\nyour house, your rules. your house isn't a hotel for him. but seriously, don't you need to evict him the legal way?\n\nnta.", "NTA.  He should have asked your permission and explained the situation.  Info, did he impregnate her?", "NTA \n\nHe knew the rules but broke them. He got himself into a bigger mess. He can stay with his new GF.", "NTA having my own place and things I work hard for I would have reacted the same. Deep down its about him needing to grow up, mature up, learn respect and get a damn job. If he wants to play house he can get his own.", "NTA. Your brother is a moocher and if you hadn't done that, you'd have two (soon to be three) living with you rent free. Change your locks immediately!!", "NTA, your space -  you were being gracious about it and he was trying to take advantage of it. Smart for not letting it linger and become harder to kick them out.", "NTA it's your house at the end of the day. Granted you should have made a contract for him to sign outlining the house rules of the house...-think the roommate agreement- \n\nHim thinking it was okay to bring someone else into your home without discussing it with you first then trying to guilt you with the 'she's pregnant' it isn't your job to house either of them. \n\nYour house. Your rules. If he couldn't stick with that then he needs to get a job and find his own place to live where he can bring home whomever he likes. You're not running a hotel since you don't charge him anything. So him taking advantage you had every right to ask him to leave", "They quite literally created this problem together. Not to mention the poor baby, lol. Change your locks to be safe. NTA", "NTA. Your brother is irresponsible, but also very disrespectful. He is also an adult, and he needs to figure out his situation, including getting a job to support his kid and girlfriend. This is not your problem OP, so stop blaming yourself.", "NTA. And you know you would have been responsible for that baby, right? Your brother can barely support himself, let alone another adult and a baby.", "Wait- so some random girl he knows is pregnant and needed a place to stay so he offered up your home?  That\u2019s a perfectly fine reason to kick her out. \n\nNow, if he got her pregnant then still ok to kick her out. She had to have been living somewhere before your bro met her. She can go back there. \n\nKicking him out is up for debate, but you allowing him to live there with no job was just stupid. I\u2019m just not sure exactly why. I understand house rules, but was this the first time? \nJust make him get a job so he can save up for his own apt with the pregnant freeloading maybe gf.", "Nta. He doesn\u2019t want to work and wants to be lazy bc you are allowing it. You have been enabling him to behave this way.", "You are NTA, but while it's understandable to be upset about your brother breaking the rules, kicking out your pregnant brother and his girlfriend might be seen as harsh. A better approach would have been to calmly discuss the situation with him and find a resolution that respects your boundaries while being empathetic to their circumstances.", "Going against the grain, YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but if your brother is a tenant, and in almost every state in the country based on your description he would be defined as a tenant requiring legal eviction to vacate premises, you do not get sole veto over him having any guests at all.\n\nFuck that, your house blah blah, no he\u2019s a tenant. Period. Should there be mutual agreement on reasonable times? Yes, but Im sorry you don\u2019t get to just say \u201cyou can never have a guest\u201d.\n\nEdit: also, if you just kicked your brother out, he probably has an Avenue to challenge that. Just because you are homeowner does not mean you can kick out a tenant whenever you want. \n\nI am so confident on this, provide the state you live in and I will provide you the state statute on it.", ">I told him I don\u2019t like company here\n\nSo he's never allowed to bring guests over? IMO, that's pretty unreasonable. ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
