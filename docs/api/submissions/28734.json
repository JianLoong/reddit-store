And I would never, ever go on a family vacation ever again.", "Nta", "NTA. Your older brother expected your parent to offer to pay for his trip, and now that he's been caught out he is trying to lay the guilt trip down thick. Unfortunately, your parents probably won't enjoy the trip as they'll worry about him while you all are gone. If it comes down to it, put a lien on his house, or his car, for the amount owed if your parents do decide to pay for his ticket.

Even though it's a gift to your parents from YOU, they won't feel good knowing your brother isn't with them, as he's also their child. So, for the sake of your parents, I'd suck it up.

Check on the cost of tickets six months out vs. six weeks out, just as an example.  Big difference.  So his prices did go up.

More than likely your parents think that whatever they leave behind for him will suffice, not understanding that they have not given him the tools to truly make it on his own.

When we went and did our own things, and totally ignored his horrible behavior, he escalated to kicking in the doors to our hotel rooms and physically trying to beat me (female), my two sisters, my other brother, and my sisters husband's up. My parents were mortified and had to send him home and pay for damages. \nGuess who hasn't been invited to a single family vacation in 20 years?  \n\nNTA and while your brother may not resort to violence, I am sure he may try to be a stick in the mud the whole trip just to make everyone miserable.", "You're a bigger person than I am.
