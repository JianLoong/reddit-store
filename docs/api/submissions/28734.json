I figured we could each pay our share as well as split the cost for my parents to treat them. My brothers are both adults (youngest 25, oldest 33) with well paying jobs. My younger brother was more than happy to contribute while my oldest brother made excuses.\n\nWe spoke to my parents about it and they were ecstatic, although I clarified I was unsure if oldest would be going. We were all having dinner together so it prompted them to ask him why he wasn't going. He gave a mirage of excuses which ranged from \"I don't know if I'll be busy that day\" to \"I am not sure I can afford it\" but he did not give a concrete answer. My parents tried convincing him that if he saved now he should be able to go, he said he'd think about it.\n\nFast forward to six months ago and I am giving updates for the no shows (oldest brother) and asked him to give me an answer as I was booking plane tickets. He said he hasn't decided and will book his own ticket given if he does go. Okay, fair enough.\n\nThree months ago I told him this was the last time I will be asking him, is he attending yes or no. He again made excuses but nothing concrete so I told him I will be taking that as a no.\n\nToday my younger brother and I had lunch together when he called us saying he will be going after all. We told him that was great and it'd make mom and dad happy but to be aware his share went up since last minute changes are expensive. He absolutely lost it and said it wasn't fair and that it wasn't his fault I was a shitty planner.\n\nMy younger brother jumped in and told him that we both paid for our parents share and have been asking and asking for months if he was going, it's not our fault you can't make up your mind.\n\nHe hung up on us.\n\nWe then got a call from our parents saying the oldest was very upset as he was excited to go but now he can't because he can't afford it. They offered to pay for him. I told them it wasn't right as this trip was a gift for them, we gave our oldest brother fair warning and he didn't care. Now hes saying I'm an asshole for excluding him from the trip.\n\nWanted to clarify some point as I did not expect this to blow up as much as it did:\n\n\\-My brother is able to afford the trip but chooses not to pay for it as my parents have a history of paying for things should he throw a fit. \n\n\\-We had discussed this plan well beforehand and I just pushed it forward as we (as siblings) were all on board. We even offered to help as long as he helped with parents share\n\n\\- He has a long history of indecisiveness and waiting until the last minute to accept (after my parents offer to fund). My mom actually agreed with me that his excuses/indirect answers mean it's a no and he has to learn his lesson if he stays behind. My dad is usually the one who offers to cover for him despite what we say.\n\n\\-I have absolutely no issue with them paying, although I don't think it's fair, I cannot control what my parents do", "created_utc": 1697069782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175t9z7/aita_for_excluding_my_brother_from_our_family/", "score": 3220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was non-committal because, to be honest, it's embarrassing to be the oldest sibling, and the poorest.\n\nHim not committing is as likely to be \"don't know if I can afford it yet\".

I'm seeing a lot of resentment from OP because bro gets bailed out, but no reason why - is he an addict?  Lazy?  Mental health?\n\nMy parents helped all their children, I may have gotten more, who knows?

As far as equity goes, like u/solo_throwaway254247, said: OP and her little brother will basically be funding their older brother if they continue with the trip. This is how rifts get started: 1 person is selfish (big bro), another wants them to learn their lesson (OP), which unfortunately means everyone loses out on something (trip cancelled), and then often what they lost out on overshadows the lesson (i.e. everyone remembers this as it being more important to OP that big brother pay for himself than that the family goes on vacation together). As a result, people then don't want to talk to each other or change their decisions, they dig in (\"I'm not paying for him!\" \"we can pay for him if we want!\"). And OP is then unfairly seen as an AH.\n\nIn a semi-perfect world, big bro would in fact step up and maybe give the \"I'll pay you back\" IOU. But in reality, he probably won't and mom and dad will be right back to shaking their heads about how \"petty\" OP is and how they can do whatever they want with their money. And then even if they say, ok, fine, we'll pay you and little brother back since you feel that way, then everyone's on vacation, with big bro still bankrolled by the parents, but now everyone's a little bit more annoyed/angry and maybe they don't *want* to be on vacation with each other anymore and then that's the last vacation they do. And then OP boycotts family get togethers because parents and bro won't admit the vacation wasn't fair, so she's not at Thanksgiving. Then maybe lil bro skips Christmas because Thanksgiving was sucked with all the tension and they are now angry too, at being stuck in the middle of something they weren't even that passionate about in the beginning. Then no one wishes anyone a Happy New Year because everyone's in sour spirits from the horrible Christmas. Then Birthday wishes are sporadically texted between whoever isn't fighting over the course of the next year and by the next holiday season, the fight has gone so long, everyone remembers the annoyance/anger/hurt more than what even really started this.\n\nSince no one's apologized, people make alternate holiday plans. And then the old tradition is broken and harder to recapture while new traditions might be popping up. By the third holiday season, someone's boyfriend wants to return to *their* family because no one's fighting and Jason and Alex just adopted a son! And then by holiday season 4, someone's getting married and their family wants to introduce them to the cousins while OP's family is still no talking to each other. And then by season 5, you have stockings with the new fam and your friend Oscar, who has tagged along the last two years, doesn't feel comfortable going to your SO's fam without you and you don't want to try to resolve this with a guest in attendance so you go back to your partner's family...and then it's been six years...then seven...\n\nOP, maybe you need to crystal-ball this with your parents so they can see that just letting big bro slide might lead to irreparable damage to the family structure.", "Hmm, I like your point. And you're right: OP didn't say that they came up with this idea together, so it does sound like she may have started something thinking they'd get on board. I see your point on that, but it does look like one of the issues behind OP's feelings about this is the fact that the parents \"bail\" this sibling out \"all of the time\". A second seems to be feeling manipulated: the brother stalled for time for months and OP and their little brother didn't have any objections because sometimes it takes a long time to sort out what you can and can't do, that's life. But then big bro yelled at his siblings for the price going up even though that's a known and expected consequence of waiting to make travel plans. And then went to their parents for apparently a full bail out (as it doesn't say that parents were going to float him the difference, but rather pay his whole bill). Now, it *is* their parents money. They can spend it how they wish, as can all of the adults in this situation. But if this was a first time thing, or if the big brother was good about paying people back, it probably wouldn't have become a fight in the first place. And if it's a consistent issue of richer family members wanting to do expensive things, big bro should address that and suggest more affordable things. It's not a conversation anyone wants to have (really, we'd rather all be able to afford everything we want to do), but if it's a problem and you're an adult, sometimes you have to just address it so everyone can make adjustments.", "OP says both brothers have well-paying jobs. So it's likely not lack of ability, but lack of planning on his part if he \"can't afford it\".

I'm not unsympathetic to not having the money to do stuff; most people are in that position at some time or another. It sucks and it can be embarrassing when you're the \"older\" person (or the person that started \"ahead\" and has been financially surpassed). But that's part of being an adult. If it's just affecting one person, then it's whatever, but if it's affecting a bunch of people and you see it causing all kids of strife, then it's not good times to not handle the situation."]}
