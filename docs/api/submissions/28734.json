Their parents pay the remaining balance.    \n\nAnd OP and younger brother can seethe at their older brother for being a fucking tool while on the vacation but their point of this was for their parents to enjoy a \"FAMILY\" vacation.     \n\nYes, yes, in the internet world justice isn't served.  But in the real world with so many people invested with so many emotions, live to fight another day.  Choose your battles.  And if they choose this one and older brother doesn't go on the \"FAMILY\" vacation then the parents are going to poo-poo while on this trip", ">  \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "it would be a bigger pain on OP's ass if OP were to make a scene out of it.\n\nparents are adults, they can do what they please with their money.\n\nsomethings are out of our control, like brother being an a-hole, and it's best to accept that than stir up more drama.", "Problem is, that defeats one of the main purposes of the trip: to treat their parents to a trip.

Because if the two other sibs paid for parents (no contribution from their bro). And then the parents turn around and pay for the bro, it's like the 2 sibs indirectly paid for their brother to come on the trip."]}
