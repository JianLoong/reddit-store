When I first introduced her to my friends, I noticed that she was getting along really well with my cousin, Dan (25M). They had a similar sense of humor and common interests. Seeing my girlfriend challenge him to a shots competition and get him drunk on tequila was the highlight of our first New Year\u2019s together. It made me really happy to see them become friends, since me and Dan are very close as well.\n\nDan started dating Joana (24F) a year and a half ago, and they got engaged last December. He called me last week and asked me if I wanted to be the best man at his wedding. Obviously I said yes. While we were talking, I mentioned how excited my girlfriend was for them and the wedding. That was the moment when he got quiet. I asked him if something happened, and he said that he and Joana decided to have a small wedding, with only family and close friends, and that no partners were allowed if they were not married or at least engaged. I got angry and asked how they could even think of this rule without taking our relationship into consideration. Dan told me that while he wanted my girlfriend there, if they made an exeption for us, then other people would expect it as well, so there was nothing he could do.\n\nWhen I told my girlfriend about what happened, she was visibly hurt. So 2 days ago I texted Joana and asked her if she Dan discussed about our \u2018situation\u2019. She said that she doesn\u2019t want a stranger at their wedding and that she doesn\u2019t consider her family, regardless of how serious our relationship is. I snapped and told Joana that most of Dan\u2019s family (therefore mine) see my girlfriend as part of the family more that they see her, since she didn\u2019t bother to build relationships with relatives other than Dan\u2019s parents.\n\nWell, Joana got mad and told my cousin about what happened. He called me an asshole and told me that I have to apologise if don\u2019t want to be replaced as best man. I told him to do it, because I won\u2019t be attending the wedding if my girlfriend isn\u2019t invited. Dan hasn\u2019t spoken to me since and my girlfriend keeps telling me that I should just apologise, because she doesn\u2019t want to be the reason why I don\u2019t have a relationship with my cousin anymore.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680114324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125wf12/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_that_i_wont_be/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This might even be reasonable if you were a regular guest...\n\nHowever, you've been with your girlfriend for 4 years! And you're the best man! Not allowing her to come is specifically callous.\n\nThey're literally saying \"it's her or us\", and your girlfriend is clearly the winner simply by not picking the fight.\n\nThey know her, she's not a stranger. But they're choosing to treat her like one. And if they lose her, and you by extension, that's the choice they made.\n\nThe groom's shame and reluctance at even bringing it up screams two things to me:\n\n1) he knows it's wrong\n2) this was the bride's decision (jealous, maybe?)\n\nKeep your heart open, but you're not the one started putting rifts in your friendship.

People are allowed to keep their wedding guest list super small if that\u2019s what they want to do. Weddings are expensive, and no one is entitled to an invitation to someone else\u2019s wedding. Plus ones can literally double the cost of a wedding, and you have to draw a line somewhere.

Getting angry that the couple did not \u201cconsider your relationship\u201d specifically before setting the guest list for their wedding is a super entitled reaction. Your girlfriend is a stranger to the bride, regardless of whose \u201cfault\u201d that is, and just because the groom hit it off well with her once doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s entitled to an invite. And especially now that you went off on her and insulted her, it\u2019s pretty surprising you expect an invitation if you threaten not to go yourself.

I don't think Dan's marriage will pass the test of time.  Any wagers on whether they last a year?", "Maybe they can\u2019t afford it, maybe their venue can\u2019t accommodate that many guests, maybe they want their wedding to be an intimate occasion and they barely know their loved ones SO well enough to include them. There are a lot of valid reasons which is why things like this should be taken on a case by case basis. Personally I do feel that long term relationships should be included but as I said in my original comment, even that can be a slippery slope because people have varying opinions on what that means."]}
