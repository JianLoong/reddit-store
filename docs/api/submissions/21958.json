I had no issues with that since I had already found another person to move in with me. I informed the other person that she can move in early if she wants (1st July instead of 10th)\n\nNow on 15th June while I was out of the apartment Jane come over takes all of her stuff out of the apartment, leave a whole load of crap outside of the apartment. I reach out to her telling her that she can't leave her trash outside the apartment as it breaks the community rules and I ask her what she's planning to do with the keys. \n\nI don't hear back from her for the next couple of days and I try calling her a couple of times but she doesn't answer my calls.\n\nI reach out a few days later asking whether she is planning to return the keys to me or the leasing office and there is no response.\n\nThe leasing office informs me that if the keys aren't returned, I'll be held responsible to pay for the new keys and lock change. I also inform the new roommate about the key situation and that i hope Jane returns the keys at the end of the lease. So my new roommate says if that's the case she will move in on the 10th since it would be inconvenient for her to stay in the apartment without the keys.\n\nOn the 9th, I remember that I have Jane's sisters number and I call her up. She tells me that Jane told her that she's returned the keys and she'll talk to Jane and let me know. An hour later Jane texts me stating that she will return the keys when the lease ends.\n\nOn the 10th, Jane strolls into the apartment, leaves the keys and tries to walk out. I tell her that there are a few pending charges that she needs to pay (previous months utilities and the 10 days rent for July)\n\nShe starts raising her voice and flat out refuses to pay for the 10 days since she had \"moved out\". I explained to her that since she still had the keys she technically hadn't moved out. \n\nShe starts yelling at me and tells me she'll pay the utilities and that I can call the cops on her if I want and walks out of the house. \n\nI am not sure if it was wrong of me to ask her to pay the rent for the 10 days!", "created_utc": 1689089739, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wumkn/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_pay_10_days_rent/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously this is the option if the friendship has run its course and you are certain that there will be no future interaction.  Yes, she had the keys and you are right on that.  They show ownership and her little plan to inconvenience you will massively backfire on her.  Also, her name was on the lease until July 10th.  That is where the judge will say that she is still responsible for her share of the rent.  She can't weasel her way out of a contract when facing a judge.  I say take her to court just so you are not inconvenienced financially by her.  You don't deserve that.\n\nETA:  When I say court I mean Small Claims.  Do not call the police because this is a civil matter.  Just go down to the court house and file the paperwork.  Doesn't take much time at all.", "Nta. She owes for the 10 days bc the other person couldn\u2019t move in. She prevented you from getting a second tenant to take her place.", "Our rent is usually monthly and I make the payments and then share the split with my roommate. So we pay on the 1st of the month for the next month. On June 1st, I paid for June 1st to 30th and the utilities for the month of May. Jane had paid for that month. \n\nOn July 1st, I had made the payment of the month of July and the utilities for June. I had informed her about the utilities share for June. I had made sure to send her the utilities for 15 days and had initially told her that since she's moving out on the 15th that I'll return the rent as well.", "She was on the lease but my apartment doesn't allow split payment. So one of us has to pay the apartment while we settle the payment split internally. \n\nI did try talking to the leasing office and they said there's nothing they can do because they see the apartment as a single household.", "Send her to a collections agency", "NTA. Jane knew you had a roommate lined up to replace her. She purposefully withheld the keys to be petty. You are correct in saying she did not move out until the keys were returned. If Jane will not pay her portion of the rent owed, take her to small claims court.", "if a new roommate can't move in, she's on the hook for the cost. Not sure what the legality of it is but I would think you could at least take it to small claims court if you're in the U.S. NTA", "NTA. This happens on Judge Judy every day! Take her to small claims court. You will 100% win!", "Actually, it wasn't wrong, per se, but the landlord should have done it. She owes for pro-rated rent since she kept the keys until the end of her lease and the landlord should be able to separate her off of your lease and send her a Final Accounting Statement. But you were NTA for letting her know and demanding her portion of the utilities.", "It's really common that rent covers from the first to the last of the month no matter what date you actually move in. If you move in after the first, they just prorate the first month's rent based on how many days are left in the month. Similarly, if the lease ends in the middle of the month, they will also prorate the last month as in this situation."]}
