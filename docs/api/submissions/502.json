She just recently dumbed me over text, but during the time we were dating she had picked up a zero-hour class since I also have one and I was able to give her a ride to it every day. Now that she broke up with me, pretty out the blue, I had continued to give her a ride for a while but seeing her every morning is making it really hard to move on for me, I still kinda have feelings for her, so I just told her she needs to find someone else for a ride. However, I'm scared she may not be able to and I really don't want her to fail or have to dropout of a class because of me.\nSo AITA? And what should I do? \nThanks for your advice.", "created_utc": 1667161629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhoyed/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_ex_a_ride/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's fine for her to ask, and it's fine for you to say no.  If she pesters you about this than she's an AH, but nobody has done anything wrong here and you shouldn't feel guilty.", "NTA. Don't forget that she knew she was going to have to get rides from other people when she broke up with you. You just surprised her and she's now taking advantage of you. Don't do this to yourself, you already know it's hurting you. It'll only get worse. Your mental health comes first. You come first.", "NAH - Ask her to try to find another ride. It might not happen overnight but....just say it like you told us.  If she goes nuclear.  Then she is TA. State your desire and reaffirm you did not give a deadline and just want to move on. If she continues to act immature.  Ask her if she would like a deadline.", "Personnally, I would not try to be nice to someone after being dumbed over text. NTA", "Good point!"]}
