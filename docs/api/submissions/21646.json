I\u2019m not hiding anything, but I\u2019m 20 years old and I feel like this isn\u2019t necessary\u201d he said \u201cHand over the phone, now.

Now give me your phone child\u201d I again said no, and informed him again that I am 20 years old, and I do not need my phone checked. He said whatever, and told me to go back to my room.

I went upstairs to figure out where it went, and sure enough, there was my dad, on the couch, going through it.
