When I first got it, there were daily phone checks. Meaning, my dad would take my phone at any random point during the day, check my search history, check my app search history, check my messages, and all sorts of things like that. this continued on until I was about 16. I haven\u2019t had a phone check in four years. However, the other day, my dad asked to see my phone when I asked him why, he informed me that he would be checking my phone. However, this phone check was different. He said that he would be checking everything, including my deleted search history, and my deleted photos. I asked him why and he said \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t checked in a long time, and I felt like checking it because I have a feeling you\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d I told him, respectfully of course, \u201cI do not want you to check my phone. I\u2019m not hiding anything, but I\u2019m 20 years old and I feel like this isn\u2019t necessary\u201d he said \u201cHand over the phone, now. If you aren\u2019t hiding anything, then why aren\u2019t you letting me check it? I pay for your phone, may I remind you, so I have every right to check it if I so please. Now give me your phone child\u201d I again said no, and informed him again that I am 20 years old, and I do not need my phone checked. He said whatever, and told me to go back to my room. The next morning, I found my phone was gone from my nightstand, where I put it every night to charge. I went upstairs to figure out where it went, and sure enough, there was my dad, on the couch, going through it. I took it out of his hand and told him that he had no right to take it without asking me first, or at least inform me that he was, and that I told him I didn\u2019t want him to go through it. He again informed me that he pays the bill and that he has every right to check it. I told him that he crossed a line of privacy and that I would never allow him near my phone again. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688799620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14twmgj/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_dad_check_my_phone/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He says he pays so he can do what he wants, then you'll need to pay for your own phone or risk him turning yours off. I wouldn't doubt that he'd try to pull some other controlling power move, though, like claiming since you live in his house he has a right to any phone.\n\nAll you can do is make preparations to move out when you can and live on your own.

You're not going to suddenly change who he is.", "NTA, tell him if you wanted to live in Communist China then you'd move to Communist China.", "NTA Your dad is a deeply and controlling. Get a new phone with your own number even if it\u2019s a cheap second hand one or something. Delete everything on your old and make sure nothing on cloud etc then do a full factory reset phone (multiple times), then hand him back his phone.  Then move out of the house asap.\n\nWhat exactly was he looking for on your phone, you could have intimate texts/images or videos on your phone for gods sake.", "NTA Change your PIN and turn off Face/fingerprint ID for starters and then take out your own phone contract if you can.", "NTA. Why is your phone unlocked when you know he wants to snoop? Only my wife knows how to get into my phone, no one else.", "NTA- as a minor I feel it was totally reasonable for him to do phone checks. But you\u2019re 20, and even though he\u2019s technically paying for it, so do most parents of their adults kids these days. A lot of the time it\u2019s cheaper for them to have a family plan.

If you want him off your back it might just be time to get your own plan though", "NTA. That\u2019s so controlling of him! I\u2019d change the passcode and make sure he never knows it.

He is also setting you up to think this behaviour is okay, one day you find you look past red flags with lovers.", "This is really creepy and intrusive.  Not okay and not normal.

That's really the minimum.", "Since he\u2019s paying for it, and it\u2019s likely in his name, he does have the right. It\u2019s an asshole move, but it\u2019s legally his phone.
