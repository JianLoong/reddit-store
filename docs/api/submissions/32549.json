{"id": 32549, "submission_id": "18d3xx9", "title": "AITA for not responding to my husband\u2019s calls when it was an emergency?", "selftext": "Hi all. Sorry if there\u2019s any issues with format, I\u2019m new to Reddit. I\u2019m only here to get some perspective because one of my friends said I could get unbiased opinions. I\u2019ll use fake names for privacy. \n\nI\u2019m a 36 yo woman with a husband (Tom) and 3 children - Kate (10yo), Mary (8yo), and William (5yo). Since my youngest was born, I haven\u2019t had any time away to myself. I haven\u2019t had a night out, a girls trip, or even just one afternoon to watch a movie and drink some wine. Before anyone comments, I don\u2019t want to do these things all the time. I know I have a responsibility to my kids. I just think it would be nice to take a break a few times a year maybe. \n\nBecause of this, one of my friends (Penny) asked me to come away on a girl\u2019s trip with our college friends to the beach for 7 days. Obviously I was skeptical since I don\u2019t want to leave my kids alone and I also don\u2019t want to force Tom to do everything himself for that long, but she eventually persuaded me. \n\nI asked Tom about this and he said I should go, he would handle everything around the house. He didn\u2019t seem worried at all, so eventually my worries faded too. I got very into the idea of an stress-free trip, so before I left, I told him to only call me for emergencies. He agreed. \n\nBut once I left and I was having a good time with my girls, Tom began calling me at least 7-8 times a day with the littlest things. Things like \u201coh Kate can\u2019t find her hairbrush, where is it?\u201d or \u201coh where\u2019s the salt and pepper\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the name of William\u2019s kindergarten teacher again?\u201d. This went on for 3 days. I kept reminding him he agreed to only call for emergencies, but he always brushed it off. \n\nEventually I got so sick of his calls because Tom promised me an stress-free trip, so I decided to just turn off my phone. But on the 5th day, Penny came up to me and said Tom called her and said I needed to come home immediately. Apparently Mary was riding her bike and hit a rock and went flying off, and she broke her arm in several places. Of course I cut the trip short and came right back home. \n\nBut when I got home, Tom was very cold and rude to me. I thought it was just because of the stress of Mary\u2019s injury, but it kept going on for days. Eventually I just asked him straight out what was wrong and he blew up at me. He said that I \u201cabandoned\u201d our kids by refusing to answer my phone and I broke my promise by not immediately responding when it was an actual emergency. He said I don\u2019t get to stop being a mother just because of a \u201cdumb vacation.\u201d I tried to defend myself and said he kept calling me over the tiniest inconveniences and interrupting the trip. Besides, he said he had everything handled. Tom responded that it \u201ccould\u2019ve been an emergency every time he called so it\u2019s my job to pick up.\u201d But I said this was exactly like the boy who cried wolf, and he said that was ridiculous. \n\nMy friends are all on my side, but Tom is still not really speaking to me. So I\u2019d just like other opinions on if I was wrong here.", "created_utc": 1701978847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d3xx9/aita_for_not_responding_to_my_husbands_calls_when/", "score": 862, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No he was weaponising his incompetence to punish you for leaving and try to make sure you never leave him with the kids again.\n\nHe didn't keep his promise, he was the boy who cried wolf and now he's trying to make you feel like it's all your fault.

Your husband is pathetic.\n\nI get the phone thing, but I'm sorry - NOTHING he called you about constitutes an emergency.\n\nIt's not going to be easy to wrangle three children if you don't do it a lot, but none of them are babies. He doesn't have to do any changes or night time feeds - maybe a bit of bath time, but nothing horrendous.\n\nEverything he asked would have been reasonable if you'd been at home - but he called you because he couldn't find a hairbrush? Here's an idea, Tom - look for it! Get your children to help look. This is not worth a goddamn phone call. Where's the medication? Call. Where's the salt and pepper? Find it yourself.\n\nI'm actually furious on your behalf. My wife had to go into hospital for a week when our first child was a few weeks old. No family was close by, so I was on my own. It was daunting as hell to try and cope with a newborn by myself, but  I did it because it was my responsibility.

Would he have dropped everything and come running if it had happened while you had the kids?\n\nYour relationship and division of labor seems incredibly broken, and it\u2019s up to you to determine how long and how far you\u2019re willing to live with it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I wonder how he thinks it was any different from The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\n\nHe promised to call only in an emergency, and then his threshold for what constituted an emergency was \"any trivial problem or question\".

He has to start taking some more of the mental load at home. Not knowing where the salt and pepper is, in his own house? Not being able to find a brush? \n\nYour husband sounds like he's an absent father who doesn't want to do parenting work.

It\u2019s his fault you were so exhausted by STUPID SHIT that you did not get his emergency call when he needed it because he abused the notion of \u201cemergency\u201d\n\nI also find it insane that she broke her arm the minute you go away. Wtf was going on in that house?", "NTA\n\nhe ensured he would handle things and did not. calling you for every little thing is wildly unprepared and inconsiderate. he said you don\u2019t get to stop being a mother, well he needs to start being a dad lol time to actually FIND the salt and pepper and learn your children\u2019s teachers names", "NTA\n\nClassic \"Boy Who Cried Wolf\".\n\nYour husband was there and dealt with it in any case. What else was supposed to be done that required ONLY you? You were not required, though you were probably missed, as you were in any case because you're not home which is good for all of them.

Tom shouldn't have promised a stress free holiday and call you for the little things. And him calling you earlier wouldn't have prevented your daughter's arm breaking anyway (not to sound insensitive)", "NTA, he agreed to only call for emergencies, and none of the things he called about prior to your daughter breaking her arm were emergencies, so you assumed (And I believe rightfully so) any future call would be the same.

Play stupid games; win stupid prizes! \n\nMen are literally capable of finding / doing things themselves, but chose to act helpless and pull their weaponized incompetence card too damn much.", "NTA - You should start calling him constantly every day over petty stuff like he was and see how long before he loses his mind over it.\n\nAlso, I know that your kid breaking their arm is a big deal, but I don\u2019t understand why your trip needed to be cut short over it. Was he unable to take her to the ER until you got back? Did you need to come home just to give mommy comfort kisses? What was it, exactly, that only you could handle and he couldn\u2019t (aside from everything, apparently)?\n\n-edit- \nTo be clear: Totally understand if you *wanted* to go back early because your kid was hurt, but as it\u2019s written he was demanding you come home early.", "NTA.

You were not unreachable. He was unable to handle it by himself. And frankly, a broken arm is a bummer, but not something to leave vacation over. Kids break their arms all the time.\n\nAsk your husband what he would do a single parent? and then ask why he couldn't do it for even one day?\n\nAnd then when he says yes to a trip, he doesn't let you enjoy it. There is zero respect there.", "You were not unreachable. NTA.", "NTA\nYa Tom is a crap parent,  he can't even find a hairbrush without you!!  He should be able to look after his iwn children without calling their mother multiple times a day.  He's the one who didn't stick to the deal  of only calling in emergencies.

Others have given a lot of good answers as to why, so I won't go into it now, I just wanted to add I tiny little thing: maybe it wasn't the best idea that for the first time your husband was alone with the kids, it was such a long time. I would have started off small, a day or two, so it's not such a big thing for anyone (you, husband or kids). A week as the first time away is a long time, and clearly your husband didn't realise what it was going to be like.\n\nHe's still the ahole for sure, and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. What he\u2019s really upset about is that you weren\u2019t there to be his buffer from responsibility. Your daughter was injured. I\u2019m sure she was terrified and in pain, and he was absolutely losing his shit because normally he would rely on you to comfort and make executive decisions.\n\nHe\u2019s angry because he had to be a father for a whole week and he didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly a broken arm was not emergency enough to end your trip for either. It is not life threatening and there is nothing you can do to fix the problem immediately. \n\nHe cried wolf too much on 'emergencies' before you turned the phone off to have any right to be upset for days about it.", "NTA. You both made promises, he actively broke his promise first (and did so constantly), which led to you passively breaking your promise. He's the boy who cried wolf.", "NTA\n\nHe was the boy who cried wolf.

Or take any trips? Or do anything for himself at all? I bet the answer is more than once every ten (10) years. \n\nFFS.

You may find you have more free time when you don't have this dude living in your house.", "I love that he said \u201cyou need to pick up because any call could have been an emergency\u201d well they weren\u2019t. She broke her promise that she would answer, he broke his promise to not call unless it\u2019s an emergency. He should be left alone with the kids more often, so he can learn how to be an adult parent. My dad always asked where stuff was. I would visit his house a couple of times a month and I knew where everything was better than him.", "NTA your explanation was correct. This is like the boy who cried wolf. Realistically speaking, even if he couldn't reach you, what could you do in that immediate second. Nothing. Once you found out you flew back up for support because again, what can you do, nothing except let doctors do what doctors do. \n\nThe fact that he knows so little about his children and household items should be a wake up call for him to realize how much of a backseat he's taken to raising the kids. It's as if you plugged a new babysitter there who hasn't really had much time with your kids or your home and asks you a q for every single thing, a babysitter I get, your husband shouldn't be as ignorant and ill prepared as a babysitter.", "NTA- Part of your responsibility to your kids, ESPECIALLY your girls is to show them that you have a balanced life. You are allowed to have a life with your friends outside of your family. Your husband is using your kids and his \u201cincompetence\u201d to control you/keep you at home. You need to explore that, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t have lunch/ dinner/ movie/shopping dates with your friends from time to time or a moment to yourself.

Don't answer his questions. Do not help. Bland dinner is not an emergency and he should know where the fkn salt and pepper are.\n\nKids fall off bikes, they get broken arms. It happens.

Sorry if there\u2019s any issues with format, I\u2019m new to Reddit. I\u2019m only here to get some perspective because one of my friends said I could get unbiased opinions. I\u2019ll use fake names for privacy. \n\nI\u2019m a 36 yo woman with a husband (Tom) and 3 children - Kate (10yo), Mary (8yo), and William (5yo). Since my youngest was born, I haven\u2019t had any time away to myself. I haven\u2019t had a night out, a girls trip, or even just one afternoon to watch a movie and drink some wine. Before anyone comments, I don\u2019t want to do these things all the time. I know I have a responsibility to my kids. I just think it would be nice to take a break a few times a year maybe. \n\nBecause of this, one of my friends (Penny) asked me to come away on a girl\u2019s trip with our college friends to the beach for 7 days. Obviously I was skeptical since I don\u2019t want to leave my kids alone and I also don\u2019t want to force Tom to do everything himself for that long, but she eventually persuaded me. \n\nI asked Tom about this and he said I should go, he would handle everything around the house. He didn\u2019t seem worried at all, so eventually my worries faded too. I got very into the idea of an stress-free trip, so before I left, I told him to only call me for emergencies. He agreed. \n\nBut once I left and I was having a good time with my girls, Tom began calling me at least 7-8 times a day with the littlest things. Things like \u201coh Kate can\u2019t find her hairbrush, where is it?\u201d or \u201coh where\u2019s the salt and pepper\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the name of William\u2019s kindergarten teacher again?\u201d. This went on for 3 days. I kept reminding him he agreed to only call for emergencies, but he always brushed it off. \n\nEventually I got so sick of his calls because Tom promised me an stress-free trip, so I decided to just turn off my phone. But on the 5th day, Penny came up to me and said Tom called her and said I needed to come home immediately. Apparently Mary was riding her bike and hit a rock and went flying off, and she broke her arm in several places. Of course I cut the trip short and came right back home. \n\nBut when I got home, Tom was very cold and rude to me. I thought it was just because of the stress of Mary\u2019s injury, but it kept going on for days. Eventually I just asked him straight out what was wrong and he blew up at me. He said that I \u201cabandoned\u201d our kids by refusing to answer my phone and I broke my promise by not immediately responding when it was an actual emergency. He said I don\u2019t get to stop being a mother just because of a \u201cdumb vacation.\u201d I tried to defend myself and said he kept calling me over the tiniest inconveniences and interrupting the trip. Besides, he said he had everything handled. Tom responded that it \u201ccould\u2019ve been an emergency every time he called so it\u2019s my job to pick up.\u201d But I said this was exactly like the boy who cried wolf, and he said that was ridiculous. \n\nMy friends are all on my side, but Tom is still not really speaking to me. So I\u2019d just like other opinions on if I was wrong here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
