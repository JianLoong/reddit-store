We were planning a small, intimate wedding with only close family and friends. Everything was going smoothly until I had to make the difficult decision of not inviting my sister (27F) to the wedding. This decision has caused a lot of tension within our family, and now I'm questioning if I am the asshole in this situation.My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. Growing up, she was always the \"favorite\" child in our parents' eyes. She received all the attention and praise, while I felt like the forgotten middle child. I was constantly overshadowed by her achievements and felt like I was never good enough.Fast forward to my engagement. From the moment I announced my upcoming wedding, my sister made it all about her. She started demanding to be involved in every aspect, hijacking decisions, and disregarding my opinions. It became clear that she was trying to take control of my special day, which left me feeling frustrated and overwhelmed.I tried to have an honest conversation with her about how I was feeling. I explained the years of pent-up resentment and how her behavior was triggering those emotions. However, instead of understanding my point of view, she dismissed my feelings and accused me of being jealous and insecure.Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. In an emotional moment, I uninvited her from the wedding, explaining that I wanted to celebrate our special day surrounded by people who genuinely supported and understood us. I didn't want our wedding to become another event where she stole the spotlight.Since then, our family has been divided. My parents are furious with me for excluding my sister, insisting that I need to \"get over\" the past and forgive her. Meanwhile, my husband's family is supportive of my decision, acknowledging the emotional toll my sister's behavior has taken on me.Now, I'm left feeling guilty and wondering if I made the right choice. A part of me believes that I should have risen above the past and extended the invitation, but another part of me thinks that it was essential to prioritize my own happiness on such an important day.AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?\n\nThank you all for the nice comments and after reading them all I decide to cut ties with my parents and my sister and schedule therapy for myself ", "created_utc": 1700476941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zlrlb/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/", "score": 304, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wedding your choice. As you know, choices have consequences and you are experiencing them. Just let it pass nothing your parents can do but complain and eventually that will stop.

She was a kid and the adult you see is a result of their actions. \n\nShe can change, and should change , I hope she does, but grow a spine, stand your ground and try to have a relationship with her. \n\nAlso, never let your  in laws divide you from your family. In their eyes, the less family you have, the more they get of their son and future grandchildren.  A daughter is always going to sway towards her own mother ( if it\u2019s a healthy relationship) when she has children, it\u2019s natural, and your in laws know that.

It backfired.", "they already got married", "Well let them know if they don\u2019t \u201clet this go\u201d then you will \u201clet\u201d their invite go to someone else", "Do you really think it wouldn\u2019t have been a negative experience when someone you don\u2019t want there is present? I think that memory would have been worse. Honestly, I think would have rescinded the parents\u2019 invite, too.", "I really think. Those actions do not give closure. There will be a lasting rift in their lives eith possible escalation. When her younger sister marry she will be excluded. When she have kids she will not be present and they will grow alienated from cousins and uncles. All becausebof a single night. Read OP post. She is not happy and sure about all this. There is no closure for her."]}
