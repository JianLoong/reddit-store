We were planning a small, intimate wedding with only close family and friends. Everything was going smoothly until I had to make the difficult decision of not inviting my sister (27F) to the wedding. This decision has caused a lot of tension within our family, and now I'm questioning if I am the asshole in this situation.My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. Growing up, she was always the \"favorite\" child in our parents' eyes. She received all the attention and praise, while I felt like the forgotten middle child. I was constantly overshadowed by her achievements and felt like I was never good enough.Fast forward to my engagement. From the moment I announced my upcoming wedding, my sister made it all about her. She started demanding to be involved in every aspect, hijacking decisions, and disregarding my opinions. It became clear that she was trying to take control of my special day, which left me feeling frustrated and overwhelmed.I tried to have an honest conversation with her about how I was feeling. I explained the years of pent-up resentment and how her behavior was triggering those emotions. However, instead of understanding my point of view, she dismissed my feelings and accused me of being jealous and insecure.Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. In an emotional moment, I uninvited her from the wedding, explaining that I wanted to celebrate our special day surrounded by people who genuinely supported and understood us. I didn't want our wedding to become another event where she stole the spotlight.Since then, our family has been divided. My parents are furious with me for excluding my sister, insisting that I need to \"get over\" the past and forgive her. Meanwhile, my husband's family is supportive of my decision, acknowledging the emotional toll my sister's behavior has taken on me.Now, I'm left feeling guilty and wondering if I made the right choice. A part of me believes that I should have risen above the past and extended the invitation, but another part of me thinks that it was essential to prioritize my own happiness on such an important day.AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?\n\nThank you all for the nice comments and after reading them all I decide to cut ties with my parents and my sister and schedule therapy for myself ", "created_utc": 1700476941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zlrlb/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm personally not that into weddings and don't really know what the expectation is, but if you want a special day for you and your SO, these people won't help.
