In addition to recovering from the oral surgery, I was also battling a sinus infection as well, so I was spending the weekend recovering from that as well.\n\nOn Sunday, my brother and his new girlfriend came to my parents\u2019 house to visit. My mom and brother had already planned this. My dad didn\u2019t know about them visiting until an hour before. My Dad already had an prior engagement,so he couldn\u2019t attend. My mom and my brother never told me at all. I had never met my brother\u2019s girlfriend and I was looking forward to it but not under this circumstance of being sick and recovering from oral surgery. When my brother and his girlfriend arrived at my parents\u2019 house, I was asleep. Like I stated before, I didn\u2019t know they were even coming or here. I woke up and I went to the kitchen to get some medication, eat, and return to my room to rest. When I got to the kitchen, I was surprised/confused to see my brother and his girlfriend here along with my mom. I was in my pajamas. I felt like I was put on the spot/ambushed. That was not how I wanted to introduce myself to his girlfriend. I tried to go along and make small talk with my brother and his gf but I wasn\u2019t feeling too well and I was in pain. Normally, I am pretty outgoing but that day, I just wanted to rest. I stayed in the living room with my mom, brother, and his girlfriend until the visit was over. \n\nAfter my brother and his girlfriend left, I asked my mom why didn\u2019t she or my brother tell me that my brother or his girlfriend were visiting. She said it was no big deal. I called my brother later to ask why he didn\u2019t mention he was bringing his girlfriend to visit. He didn\u2019t have an answer. My brother and I were already trying to setup some time for me to meet his girlfriend, but this was not the right time or circumstance. I feel like if my mom and/or my brother had told me about this planned visit, I would have been able to prepare (get dressed/eat before hand/medications/be awake), but they didn\u2019t. I feel ambushed in this situation.

Then he tried 3 more times to get you to meet, and you shot down every attempt.\n\nNow you act all dramatic and pissy because meeting his gf is such an important event.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m sorry you felt ambushed. I think your mom should have mentioned that company was coming but she\u2019s not an AH for not doing so.", "You are not the asshole", "NAH. I get being caught off guard, but you are at your mom's house, she's allowed to have company over whenever without informing you.", "NAH\n\nSounds more like you crashed their visit with your mom than them visiting you.", "NAH\n\nYou had a dental procedure. I understand not feeling well or looking your best but this isn't a huge deal that they stopped by. You weren't 'ambushed' and there seems to have been no expectation that you participate. \n\nIf you are staying as a guest in someone's home, even your parents, expect you don't have control over your environment. And this was your brother. It seems a ton of preparation and notification that he's stopping by is normal. \n\nI", "NAH here.\n\nIt really sounds like a spontaneous visit where your brother just wanted to drop by with his new girlfriend and, of course, your mum said yes. Your mother likely did not want to turn it into a big thing and assumed you would likely be sleeping through the visit and would be meeting his new girlfriend on a separate occasion.\n\nYou should probably let this drop and not keep pushing your mother and brother for an explanation. They weren't even thinking about you--your brother just wanted his mother to meet his new girlfriend.", "YTA. You live in a home with other people. You didn't feel well. Their lives should stop for that?  No.", "I'm a bit torn and leaning towards NAH: it's likely that no one had ill intent and more likely that they simply didn't think it through.\n\nThey may indeed all be easygoing sorts, and that's cool. It's also perfectly okay for you to want to feel presentable and at your best. \n\nI hope the next meeting has you all all smiles and relaxation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
