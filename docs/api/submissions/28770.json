Should I escalate this to HR?", "selftext": "Story 1- Back in June I got a new coworker to work the cell right by me. (We'll call him M) Another co-worker I had at the time (Called J) was the only other white person who worked in my area. \n\nM is very introverted like me. We show up, do our job, and go home. I enjoy having a coworker who doesn't want to engage in smalltalk, and think we were paired together for this similarity. J is very extroverted, and would often start up chats with me. We were a closest in age and had similar interests, so we talked the most out of my coworkers. \n\n J worked right by A. (They work in a cell about 15 feet away from me.) One day, A suddenly because very cold and short with J. He came up to me twice and asked \"Why does A hate me all of a sudden? Did I do something wrong? It''s making everyone uncomfortable\"\n\nWhich was true. I noticed many of my other coworkers giving me wary and suspicious looks. This went on for about 2 weeks until J asked him outright what was wrong. \n\nA said he was worried J and me were racist. Particularly against him because he is from Africa. M is also African American (born in USA). His reason for suspecting is because he felt discluded from conversations, and felt like we were ignoring M and singling him out. \n\n Things (I thought) were resolved. J resolved to talk more with him and M. For a bit I would make a bit of small talk with M so he wouldn't worry. Since then we've gone back to being quiet. \n\n I also would talk with A more. But it is difficult to because our workstations are far and blocked off from one another.  He even complimented my work hat saying it looked good on me and seemed like we were on good terms now. \n\nStory 2- This happen tonight. So one thing I do at night is taking out the trash. Part of this is going around and emptying everyones trash into a big wheely bin from their work station. I used to rotate this duty with J. But after he left, I've taken over and it's become part of my nightly routine. \n\n M helps empty the trash cans from the other stations. We've both gotten into a routine were we both go for the same garbage cans every night out of habit. \n\nA asks if he can talk to me for a second when im cleaning. Sure, of course. He asks \"Is there any reason I never come back here to get this garbage can?\" I then have to walk in to his work station to even notice it was there. I tell him genuinely I didn't notice there was a bin there. He asks me AGAIN, and I repeat myself. Feeling dumb for being unobservant now. \n\n He then says \"Well, M's been since J left.\" He then asked if there was a reason only M was getting it. I repeat I didn't know it was there, and it wasn't a personal thing. That me and M were just in the routine of grabbing cans in a certain order at this point. \n\nThen he says. \"Well I've been watching you for 3 weeks now doing this. I'll continue to keep an eye out just in case\" Was this a threat?

You should have reported this to management when it first began but it's not to late now. Report it to your manager and HR so they can hopefully resolve it.", "NTA - I think A is trying to intimidate you. You are an easy target because your a young, introverted female. Maybe work on a script to tell him to mind his own business next time, because I think he enjoys feeling like he can confront you and make you squirm.\n\n You could consider going to HR to talk to someone about this - just remember that HR is not your friend and they aren\u2019t there to protect *you*, so you really have to feel out your company\u2019s culture and consider whether HR would take you seriously, or would just assume you are in the wrong.\n\nFinally, getting another job is always an option.  Sometimes that is the best way to deal with a toxic work environment.", "This hasn't really escalated to a conflict yet. \n\nBringing up the possibility of racism, once, is probably not something worth escalating. If the accusations were frequent, or disruptive, then you could certainly make a case to HR that it's prohibited harassment. \n\nBut I wonder if you've got a problem you're not able to see. \"A\" seems to be concerned that \"M\" is not fully included, or is treated differently than other workers. \n\nIs it possible that \"M\" has confided some concerns or dissatisfaction with \"A\", and \"A\" feels like he has to interject on \"M\"'s behalf? \n\nIt's certainly possible that racism is not the root cause of anyone's unhappiness here. But it is possible that \"M\" is unhappy, they have confided in \"A\", and \"A\" (being a nearby employee of African descent) feels a need to intercede.", "NTA.\n\nReport his to HR, both incidents.  Be very clear that you do not want to engage in small-talk with this person, etc. but will do whatever work interactions are required.\n\nYou are not required to be \"social\" at work, just to do your job and be respectful.  If A doesn't like that you don't want to be friendly with him that's just too bad, but do not let any ideas of you being racist take root.  His history and issues aren't yours, and you're not obligated to deal with them.", "More context - The person in the story (I'll call A) is originally from Africa but moved to the USA. We work in a factory in the upper Midwest. Our city has a grim history of racism. We live a couple hours away from where George Floyd was murdered. We live in an area common for Africans to immigrant to now, and my workplace has a specific program for it. The percentage of people working here on this program makes up about 60% of the workforce. \n\n I (24F) am not very social. I'm incredibly introverted and don't talk much, if at all sometimes with my coworkers. I don't tend to talk to someone unless they talk to me first, to which I can hold conversations well. Which catches some off guard, as most people think introverted=social anxiety.", "NTA This seems like your coworkers are just busibodies who are prejudiced against introverts\n\narent you supposed to be working, not talking?", "NTA  \nExtroverts have been telling each other, and everyone else, for ever that there is something wrong with introverts, we are a disease to be cured. Many feel personally offended if you fail to talk to them/engage in conversation at every opportunity. Sounds like they were waiting on you to approach, for the garbage can, so they could force you to chat with them.  \nSounds a bit creepy, really. Definitely keep a record.", "NAH\n\nMaybe you can have a mediation with A and whoever else may be involved to clear the air. Being a minority in America, you are almost constantly faced with racist behavior, both direct and indirect. A maybe particularly sensitive to this and is thus attributing neutral behavior to nefarious reasons. Get a neutral 3rd party involved so you can come to an understanding before jobs get jeopardized over a misunderstanding.", "I loathe people that Always play the race card. \nit frustrates me.\nyou're not being racist, I'd definitely speak to HR.\nnta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had to shorten some of the story to fit on here because of the character limit. A longer version of what happened can be found on the previous post on my page where I posted this in the smaller AITAH sub. Here though main important points and trimmed unnecessary detail to be more concise. \n\n It definitely wasn't a joke, and was said plainly. I wish I would've outright stated then that this made me uncomfortable. Thank you again for helping confirm this wasn't a normal thing to say tona coworker", " I'm inclined to agree.

I could see him being protective over a younger person who shares his race. I don't know if A's ever encountered racism in the workplace and is hypersensitive to it. Or that A may be taking his job disatisfaction out on his co-workers. \n\nThank you for your insight on my situation. I'm thinking about giving A a three strike policy, if he doesn't something like this again I'll take it to HR.", "Honestly, it sounds like A is the problem person here. He\u2019s being passive aggressive because he doesn\u2019t understand introverts (and potentially doesn\u2019t understand American culture as much as he thinks). I would talk with M and explain that you don\u2019t care about coworkers because they\u2019re coworkers and small talk sucks. Coworkers don\u2019t have to be friends, just amicable towards each other. \n\nCould there be some internalized bias? Maybe, but missing a trash can because you didn\u2019t know there was one is not racism. Not talking to male coworkers because you\u2019re a woman is not strange either; especially being an introvert as well.", "This is something I considered too. I've had coworkers in a past workplace who've taken my introversion personally. When it's clearly not about them. \n\n And yup, that's part of what I like about my job. It requires some focus as we're working with our hands and taking measurements. Whenever I talk with someone it takes me away from my work.", "I would send an email to your boss and cc HR stating \n\n\"I'm concerned about a misunderstanding and don't know how to proceed.\"\n \nexplain the situation without embellishments or emotion and then end with\n\n \"Please advise.\""]}
