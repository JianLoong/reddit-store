Jake, Max, and my stepdad all say it annoys them that all she wants to talk about it the past. She is like this in person, too. No matter how many times we smile and nod and sometimes even say we are not interested in armchair therapy from her, she just says she has a right to express her feelings and she's trying to start a dialogue. Part of her whole thing is deciding that her dad basically replaced her with me because she reminds him of her mother, and that because he loves my mum and never loved hers, I am his favourite/golden child. \n\nThis all came to a head over Christmas, when Bella noticed the family photos my parents had on a shelf in their dining room. She asked where the picture of her and her dad at her graduation was, and he said they'd moved it to make room for a picture of me and him and my mum at my wedding, and her graduation photo was now in the lounge. Bella scoffed and sneered 'of course'. Over lunch, I was talking about a photoshoot I was working on, and Bella chimed in about how our parents will probably replace more photos of her with ones from my photoshoot. I told her this makes no sense because the photos aren't even going to be of me, and she just said it didn't matter, she was invisible when I was around and that I took her place in everyone's life - her dad's, her brothers', even my husband.\n\nAt this point I just snapped and said that that was an absurd accusation when she makes every family conversation about herself, and while we all appreciate she is deeply hurt by a lot of things, we're all sick of being psychoanalysed. I said that her obsession with me was ridiculous, because the only person I've ever head compare us is her, and that she needs to find someone qualified and appropriate to discuss these hurt feelings with and stop suffocating us all with her feelings because we're all bored. Jake just started laughing and Max shouted 'thank God someone said it', but Bella burst into tears and left the table.

Candidly, I can see why she felt that way. It must have been painful for a sixteen year old girl to see her father - and her brothers - adjust so quickly to a new family dynamic, with a brand new sister her own age, while she was struggling. \n\nThat said, her way of communicating her feelings clearly crossed a line with everyone. No one likes being psychoanalyzed or told regularly that they\u2019re a golden child/narcissist, and I bet that pushed her even further away from your family unit. You\u2019re not TA for snapping after years of those remarks. \n\nBella has very clearly been in a pain for a long time, and doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s part of her own family. I think that should be the main takeaway here. The easy thing to do is cut people out who go against the grain, but Bella seems like she\u2019s been asking for help and change, albeit with armchair therapy. If your family cares about her, I think it\u2019s time to try and listen.", "NTA.  Although, as someone else here already stated, you could have been more diplomatic.   I'm sure her family loves her very much, but it does sound as if her brothers and father *like* you more than they like her. All the psychoanalysis in the world isn't going to change one simple fact: People gravitate towards those whom they feel good to be around.  People avoid those that are unpleasant to be around. She's been told that no one appreciates her psychoanalysis.  It's really not much different from finger pointing and name calling.  I think it's really important that she get some help.  I don't think her relationships will improve much until she can start owning that she is, in fact, responsible for her own happiness and won't gain any points for creating stress and aggravation for everyone she's around.", "NTA", "NAH \n\nShe needed that wake up call and her dad seriously needs to convince her into getting therapy. She could def harm herself and that would be tragic. She's obviously hurting and channeling it down the wrong path. I think everyone should seek family counseling. Something has remained broken and the resentment isn't just going to go away on its own.", "NTA. In time she might come around, but if not then it will be to her brothers and dad to work on it. As for you just stay on the sidelines, as she will probably not listen to you.", "NAH\n\nOP, Bella is 30 yrs old. She needs to get herself into therapy to figure out more effective ways to deal with her issues. \n\nAt this point, she may be embarrased and you could reach out and let her know you didn't mean for her to remove herself from the family, but you  (and others based on the comments) simply wanted her to stop the armchair psychology. \n\nIf you feel you can as a stepsibling suggest she rejoin the group chat, but encourage her to participate in other ways. Also, privately if you feel you can, suggest she start some actual therapy for her issues.", "[deleted]", "ESH. \n\nBella clearly has some stuff she needs to work through. You all should have been encouraging her into therapy rather than just sitting there fuming. If you\u2019d collectively done something about this sooner this blow up likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\nIn particular her dad should have stepped in and discussed things. Also, knowing that Bella feels she\u2019s been replaced, it was tactless in the extreme to say her photo of a milestone event had been moved to make room for yours. \n\nBella lacks insight and manners. She should have sought therapy and dropped the topic with you all when it was clear that you weren\u2019t interested.", "NTA, but almost ESH. It would have been better to say this to her alone, so that it wasn\u2019t a humiliating moment for her. \n\nAlso, since she\u2019s someone you will probably have to be connected to for a long time, it\u2019s probably worth it to do the reparative work of giving her a call, telling her you don\u2019t all hate her, and telling her you wish she would relax and just enjoy being part of the family, because then she\u2019d discover that everyone does like her and that everything is okay, because the only reason she feels like an \u201coutsider\u201d is that everyone feels tense around her because she is always looking for conflict.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously really struggling and has been for a long time. While her efforts to start a dialogue weren\u2019t well executed, you have to appreciate that she tried. It would have been better for her to start counseling and maybe confront her dad privately, but you would obviously isolate her from the family if you publicly humiliate her after she\u2019s been open about how hurt she is. You can\u2019t pretend to be surprised that public ally humiliating someone and teaming up on her like children would cause her to withdraw.\n\nShe was out of line. You had valid points but your approach was cruel. The real issue here is probably her dad. No one is managing this well.", "ESH. I get why it's annoying but laughing at and humiliating her isn't going to help anyone. This kind of behaviour of hers rarely comes out of nowhere, as she said, she's trying to start a dialogue and her issues are being ignored by the people that are supposed to care about her. \nBella sucks for failing to realise that sometimes people just don't care about what you're going through. Perhaps isolating herself from all of you would be good for her. \nAlso, your parents replacing a photo of her with one of you was really sh*tty. Perhaps her point about you being chosen over her all the time might actually have some ground...", "Is this why therapists are always pegged as having the most personal issues? They first gain interest in the subject in order to psychoanalyze their own lives.", "NTA\n\nLook, if she feels like her dad and brothers replaced her with you then she should be angry/take it up with *them*. There is no need for her to attack you at Christmas over *your parents* choice of photo placement. \n\n You were a child when your parents got together and it is is no way your fault that she feels replaced. \n\nI have two bio sisters, my parents are constantly swapping around pictures of us from various important functions graduations, birthdays, weddings, etc, etc, \u2026 it\u2019s just what happens when you have multiple kids!

Unproductive and  absolutely incorrect. But regardless of trauma, the other behavior isn\u2019t correct either and she needs to be aware of it and deal with it.

I also think the OP should show step-siblings some empathy.  And honestly, it's the parents' fault for allowing this to go on so long that it's now affected their children's adult relationships.  Toxic parenting at its finest here. Your father obviously is aware that your sister has had these issues for years, knowing that he replaced her picture on the wall. Why not have both up?\n\nIf they all felt this way, if you valued her relationship, then you would sit down to work it out. Expressing the feels from all sides.

I\u2019d acknowledge what you say here- she feels alienated since her dad moved on and that\u2019s understandable, you\u2019ve seen it right? And she can get support for that from someone who knows how to deal with it, and you all are there for her. You (rightly) do not see how hashing out the past is solving anything given everyone has tried listening for so long, and it\u2019s not helping her to date. A professional would help apply what she\u2019s learning.\n\nShe clearly wants to be part of the family, I\u2019d think maybe you can still salvage it and get her help if your family can get on the same page and handle it with compassionate care. \n\nHer dad did remarry and since then she has been the outcast from what you describe. Has anyone acknowledged where she maybe rightfully entitled to her feelings? I think she will be more receptive to get help as a solution than to blame it on her if all of you acknowledge this and only this (not go in directions she can misinterpret, just listen and affirm you hear her - not get into if you see it the same, your experience is different like you described).\n\nYou are right, you all saying she is an outcast on purpose would be untrue and she\u2019s fixing on that, she does need to be focused on her inability to see and accept she\u2019s still there at the table.

I understand I'm exaggerating this but surely you must understand what a slap in the face replacing her picture was with you when she already is having problems because her father never properly helped her through the divorce and being forced into your family? I think you're being a little pretentious here. I think your entire family honestly did her dirty and now that stuff is coming up because none of you ever did anything about this earlier you're all acting like she's some weirdo and it seems like you guys have your own special family group and she's on the outside looking in and trying to relate or work her way in and you all just sat there and laughed at her and moved her pictures to the lounge.

My sister and I are closer as adults than either of us are to our brother, and my brother is closer to our parents than my sister and I are.  None of us think this is unfair.  We all get along fine, and we do things together as a family. It's just that my sister and I have more in common with each other than with our parents and brother and vice versa.  No one is going to want to spend time with an angry wet blanket though.\n\nShe needs to try.  There are a host of things that a grown adult, living independantly (and therefore not dependent on family for constant emotional support) could do:\n\nAsk her dad to hang out with her, doing an activity that they both enjoy. \n\nTry NOT talking about how she feels alienated all the time and actually join in on conversations about other topics. \n\nDO SOMETHING in her own life and talk about that.\n\nGo to therapy.

I do fall for the same sort of narcissistic BS my mother pulled sometimes by being overly empathetic to people who claim to be hurting.

OP and the other siblings were her same age when it happened; it\u2019s not their faults. I can\u2019t see OP or the brother as ah\u2019s because they\u2019re reacting the only way someone can with the stepsister\u2019s chosen methods of talking about things.

You all just don't care.", "NTA-funny she sends people articles when she needs to be working on herself and her issues", "You didn't isolate her from her family, her behavior did", "Based entirely what you have written here which is only your side, and without any other side, NTA.\n\ni don\u2019t see, though, why any of you bother rising to her bait.  She can try to open a dialog all she wants, but if no one responds, there is nothing to \u2018dialog\u2019 about.    \n\nas for the photo, which triggered this upset, it may help if they were rotated a bit more often in that prominent spot, and include some showing the brothers, the parents as a couple, the whole family, maybe even some nice shots of some vacation scenery in the rotation.  Kind of update that spot with successive major events in everyone\u2019s life.\n\nI had three brothers, and still have three sisters, so sibling issues are somewhat familiar territory for me, and mostly, we all manage to get along.  I do understand feeling frustrated and needing to tell one of your siblings to just shut the f up, but perhaps you need some more empathy, as rightly or wrongly according to the actual facts of her childhood, she does feel unheard, and less than the rest of you, especially you.\n\nGive her a pass on this one and ask her to accept your apology for being less sensitive to her feelings than you could have been.", "Of course you were and you know it.  You admit your stepsister is in pain and has been taking out her frustrations on people in the family.  You saw a picture she cared about get replaced with a picture of you and without any empathy imply she improperly reacted with a sneer and a scoff.  Instead of making a post months or years ago in an appropriate thread asking for suggestions on how to help your family member, you watch as her pain increases and causes more collateral damage to you and the rest of family.  This confirms what you mentioned earlier in your post, you just do not like her.  So you blow up on her in front of everyone, maybe irreparably damaging her relationship with the family, possible causing another /s \"wonderful\" no contact scenario. Then you come in here where you know many redditors enjoy seeing families implode and you'll get validation for your actions.\n\nListen, I'm not saying you are responsible for her well being.  She is obviously in pain and has been trying to figure out what going on by psychoanalyzing the situation but has gotten stuck on everyone else's possible role instead of focusing on healing herself.  She may or may not heal from this.  But a loving family member ie someone who tried to find a way to reach her at a more conducive time may have been a difference maker.  While it may be too late to prevent the damage that has been done, imo it is not too late to try to repair the relationship and find a way to support Bella in healing herself.  I sure hope this doesn't turn into another /s \"happy reddit ending\" frequently featured in these threads where no one in a family talks to one another.  Best wishes.", "Idk I feel bad for your stepsister. It sounds like she has a lot of wounds to work through. Idk either of your stories, but from the little you shared, it sounds like she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s part of the family unit. And as annoying as her armchair psychology can be, it seems like this might be her way of trying to bridge that gap and open up conversations about how she feels to hopefully feel better. When someone is struggle so intensely with something, the way you reacted to her can be very alienating. And before anyone says that I\u2019m in support of coddling her, I think it\u2019s important to hold space for people going through mental illness of any kind and be invited in very intentionally. It sounds like it\u2019s time to have a convo with her where you say that the arm chair psychology has been a lot for your family and you try to listen, but you would prefer to listen to her feelings without all of the psych terms she feels she has to use to feel legitimate or like she\u2019s taken seriously. The fact that she\u2019s gone silent and isolated herself is concerning to me and I think it would be kind of you reached out and tried to talk to her. Sometimes we all need a little extra love and it sounds like she\u2019s in need of that. I think her family blowing up on her and making her feel bad or embarrassed about what she\u2019s been sharing and maybe has been helping her understand herself is not the best route, so I\u2019d highly encourage OP and whoever else is able, dad, mom, siblings, to sit down and talk to her about her feelings and hear her out for real. From there you can make a game plan as do what would be most helpful to her, whether that\u2019s therapy, group therapy, treatment, changing up family dynamics etc. bc I can bet that she isn\u2019t bringing this stuff up to be annoying, there\u2019s something there and if u don\u2019t want to lose her for good it\u2019s worth really hearing her out.", "Yeah I'd feel pretty damn bad if I came home and my graduation picture with my dad had been moved for her wedding picture. Op is n-t-a but Bella isn't either. She's hurt. I honestly felt pretty bad for her.\n\nNAH", "She is 30 though\u2026 at that point she should be going to therapy, not her father sending her\u2026", "She\u2019s 30. There comes a point where she is responsible for how she handles herself. Yeah, her family messed up but she can\u2019t blame them forever saying that\u2019s the reason why she can\u2019t seek help. She needs to be placed with some accountability in this situation. She isn\u2019t a damsel in distress.", "Yeah, the more I re read the post, the more the family sounds like AH. Bella isn't handling it correctly, but most of us handle things incorrectly from time to time. She feels unheard and replaces, and I'm kinda understanding why. OP doesn't sound like an AH, really, but I can't tell for sure.", "Her graduation was years ago, unless she got a PhD; she's 30. She's in a different stage in her life. I think this is probably the more stressing factor. Her stepsister is married and has outshined her yet again.  \n\nBut I think it's perfectly natural for parents to replace older photos with newer photos. Especially as children grow and move through different stages in their life.  It sounds like they just moved the photo to a different room, it's not like they burned it in a ritual.", "I don't understand why everyone is so hung up on the picture. People are allowed to rearrange their photos, and someone who is 30yo needs to stop taking offense to that. My mom rearranges her photos like twice a month, and no one in our family is throwing a fit over it. It's not like they threw it out, they just moved it. She can't expect her parents to keep their home forever suspended in time so that she can feel like the most special.", "I want to know if that grad photo was the only one of Bella in that area before it was moved.", "The whole situation is a self fulfilling prophecy. She psychoanalysis everything ad nausium, people get annoyed she shoves it down their throats, she picks up on people liking her less and uses the consequences of her own actions as evidence she was right all along.", "Bella is a top AITA contributor then.", "I\u2019m not a narcissist, bitch I\u2019m Narcissus!", "Well duh that 16 yr old in Iowa knows all!", "It would be really tough to try to engage with someone about their mental health if their go-to is to accuse you of being a narcissist via group chat.", "Yeah that's it to me, seeking out material and sending it to family entirely to say that they are a problem isn't about a dialogue, it's I directly targeted action of her pointing at someone and telling them that they're a problem.", "Depends on how they\u2019re rearranged. Just moving one photo and having all kids but one in one room is a big yikes. Esp if it\u2019s been there since she graduated, which it appears like", "No is a complete sentence!", "Stop Making Sense is such a great rockumentary", "They just moved the photo to a different common area. Is the dining area the specialist place to put only the most special photos or something?", "Some people have their maturity stunted by some form of childhood trauma. Unfortunately for this theory, Bella's only indication of that in this story is that she **is** so immature. So more likely, she hasn't matured because life hasn't yet forced her to do so. She absolutely needs to learn how to ask directly for what she wants or requires, because she is going about it in a really counterproductive way. I assume she desires to feel validated by her family, and is instead acting in a way that only earns her scorn.\n\nBella's father is either extremely oblivious or doesn't care enough about her to consider how his actions will hurt her feelings. Replacing the picture of the two of them with a picture of him with OP was bound to play into her feelings of being replaced, and he doesn't seem to have any real reason to have done so. At most, he should have replaced it with a more up-to-date photo of him and Bella.\n\nThe rest of the family, including OP, sound at best slightly annoyed by Bella, but her misguided attempts to (presumably) ask for help could be the entire cause of that. Or she could, at least potentially, be the family scapegoat and they don't like that she's not taking everyone's crap the way she did growing up. But that's a huge leap given the utter lack of information given by the story, and thus isn't especially likely.\n\nIt's also possible that Bella herself has some sort of mental issue like a personality disorder and is doing this because she desires to cause drama amongst her blended family. But most people trying to manipulate others are a ton better at it than this, since her behavior is only working to unite them against her. Though, I suppose this could also be something like be a delusion where she perceived equal treatment as teens as unfairly favoring her step sister.\n\nI strongly suspect that whatever is wrong with Bella would be best treated by therapy of some sort. I don't think her goal has been negative attention from her family, so maybe being called out will be the catalyst she needs to actually get treatment instead of whatever it is she's attempting to do.", "Now I am not a professional and do get help.\nBut [insert advice I will give anyway].", "You two should get divorced.", "Help help! I\u2019m being oppressed!", "Wow - that\u2019s a really impulsive, angry reaction. Maybe that means you have ADHD. Or autism. Both! All the disorders.", "DARVO is a thing. I saw many cases of abusers using it to make themselves look like victims. Like a guy who beat up his girlfriend who was pregnant at the time she was bruised all over her face and was swollen. He had claimed the scratch on his face was because of her being hormonal and crazy. The issue neighbor heard her screaming for help and saw when she scratched him. I have seen the victims go to jail because an abuser used DARVO.", "This one is actually a weirdly helpful term - Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim Order. A person hurts or wrongs someone else, and then follows that pattern; *No, I didn't - How dare you accuse me of - I'm just so hurt that you think that of me/this is all your fault somehow.* Once you can recognize it, it's a pattern that crops up a lot! I think it's a pretty common immature response to wrong-doing that a lot of people can slip into, but it's the last stage that can cause real problems.", "so do you think that people with personality disorders ARE evil and can never improve? i'm confused haha", "I know my parents rotate out photos periodically. That doesn\u2019t mean they like my child more than my niece, for example, they just want to showcase different photos from time to time. It could be no deeper than that.", "I'm not annoyed at all, just looking at this from another perspective. I voted NAH, because I absolutely do sympathize with her step sister. I also had problems in my teenage years that went unhelped and it SUCKS. It doesn't just go away because nobody \"meant to\" let me suffer alone, but analyzing the situation alone from a psychology book didn't help me and it won't help her either. I need therapy and she does too. She won't stop suffering until she actually gets the help she should have been given in her teens. Parents aren't professionals and they often aren't qualified to help their kids through this transition alone. Therapy was always the answer, her parents failed to provide it, but that doesn't mean that she's doomed to feel this way forever. \n\nAlso, I never said that she SHOULDN'T talk to her siblings, just that she needs help to find a better way to communicate.    Of course she should tell them how she feels, but she should  also really work through them because it is so much deeper than seeing somebody as a golden child who is replacing you, guaranteed. There are so many mixed feelings and unspoken anxiety that she has no idea how to interpret and understand on her own, and she's not doing anybody any favors guessing. \n\nThat being said, I'm not expecting you to change your vote because this Reddit stranger has a little bit of a different opinion. You think everybody sucks, I think nobody does. That's fine. Doesn't have to be more than a dialogue, I'm not offended. Really I'm just clarifying that I'm not annoyed, angry, or upset nor do I think negatively of the stepsister because that's not at all what I was trying to say.", "My 16 yr old did this. She stopped when I started taking her to actual, reputable peer reviewed studies on psychiatric association websites for each condition she'd decided she or one of us had. Made her stop real quick. Damn TikTok straight to hell tho", "Things that are gaslighting: a series of abusive manipulation tactics and lies over a long period of time by someone you trust in order to unsettle you, make you question your own perception and trust their word over your own, thus making you more dependent on them and susceptible to their abuse.\n\nThings that are not gaslighting: defensiveness, misunderstandings, lack of accountability, run of the mill lies, jokes, immaturity, surprises", "What are you talking about sir. You need to get back on your meds", "Don't forget the word \"abuse\". That's way overused"]}
