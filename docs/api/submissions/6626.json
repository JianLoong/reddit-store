Jake, Max, and my stepdad all say it annoys them that all she wants to talk about it the past. She is like this in person, too. No matter how many times we smile and nod and sometimes even say we are not interested in armchair therapy from her, she just says she has a right to express her feelings and she's trying to start a dialogue. Part of her whole thing is deciding that her dad basically replaced her with me because she reminds him of her mother, and that because he loves my mum and never loved hers, I am his favourite/golden child. \n\nThis all came to a head over Christmas, when Bella noticed the family photos my parents had on a shelf in their dining room. She asked where the picture of her and her dad at her graduation was, and he said they'd moved it to make room for a picture of me and him and my mum at my wedding, and her graduation photo was now in the lounge. Bella scoffed and sneered 'of course'. Over lunch, I was talking about a photoshoot I was working on, and Bella chimed in about how our parents will probably replace more photos of her with ones from my photoshoot. I told her this makes no sense because the photos aren't even going to be of me, and she just said it didn't matter, she was invisible when I was around and that I took her place in everyone's life - her dad's, her brothers', even my husband.\n\nAt this point I just snapped and said that that was an absurd accusation when she makes every family conversation about herself, and while we all appreciate she is deeply hurt by a lot of things, we're all sick of being psychoanalysed. I said that her obsession with me was ridiculous, because the only person I've ever head compare us is her, and that she needs to find someone qualified and appropriate to discuss these hurt feelings with and stop suffocating us all with her feelings because we're all bored. Jake just started laughing and Max shouted 'thank God someone said it', but Bella burst into tears and left the table. She went home early and has since removed herself from the group chat and isn't talking to her dad or brothers.

Candidly, I can see why she felt that way. It must have been painful for a sixteen year old girl to see her father - and her brothers - adjust so quickly to a new family dynamic, with a brand new sister her own age, while she was struggling. \n\nThat said, her way of communicating her feelings clearly crossed a line with everyone. No one likes being psychoanalyzed or told regularly that they\u2019re a golden child/narcissist, and I bet that pushed her even further away from your family unit. You\u2019re not TA for snapping after years of those remarks. \n\nBella has very clearly been in a pain for a long time, and doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s part of her own family. I think that should be the main takeaway here. The easy thing to do is cut people out who go against the grain, but Bella seems like she\u2019s been asking for help and change, albeit with armchair therapy. If your family cares about her, I think it\u2019s time to try and listen.", "NTA.  Although, as someone else here already stated, you could have been more diplomatic.   I'm sure her family loves her very much, but it does sound as if her brothers and father *like* you more than they like her. All the psychoanalysis in the world isn't going to change one simple fact: People gravitate towards those whom they feel good to be around.  People avoid those that are unpleasant to be around. She's been told that no one appreciates her psychoanalysis.  It's really not much different from finger pointing and name calling.  I think it's really important that she get some help.  I don't think her relationships will improve much until she can start owning that she is, in fact, responsible for her own happiness and won't gain any points for creating stress and aggravation for everyone she's around.", "NTA", "NAH \n\nShe needed that wake up call and her dad seriously needs to convince her into getting therapy. She could def harm herself and that would be tragic. She's obviously hurting and channeling it down the wrong path. I think everyone should seek family counseling. Something has remained broken and the resentment isn't just going to go away on its own.", "NTA. In time she might come around, but if not then it will be to her brothers and dad to work on it. As for you just stay on the sidelines, as she will probably not listen to you.", "NAH\n\nOP, Bella is 30 yrs old. She needs to get herself into therapy to figure out more effective ways to deal with her issues. \n\nAt this point, she may be embarrased and you could reach out and let her know you didn't mean for her to remove herself from the family, but you  (and others based on the comments) simply wanted her to stop the armchair psychology. \n\nIf you feel you can as a stepsibling suggest she rejoin the group chat, but encourage her to participate in other ways. Also, privately if you feel you can, suggest she start some actual therapy for her issues.", "ESH. She\u2019s clearly experiencing trauma- you handled this very poorly. She was being annoying absolutely. But your response was also bad. And the guys who laughed and agreed are also wrong. \n\nNot a single person in this story sounds like they did anything positive or productive.", "ESH. \n\nBella clearly has some stuff she needs to work through. You all should have been encouraging her into therapy rather than just sitting there fuming. If you\u2019d collectively done something about this sooner this blow up likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\nIn particular her dad should have stepped in and discussed things. Also, knowing that Bella feels she\u2019s been replaced, it was tactless in the extreme to say her photo of a milestone event had been moved to make room for yours. \n\nBella lacks insight and manners. She should have sought therapy and dropped the topic with you all when it was clear that you weren\u2019t interested.", "NTA, but almost ESH. It would have been better to say this to her alone, so that it wasn\u2019t a humiliating moment for her. \n\nAlso, since she\u2019s someone you will probably have to be connected to for a long time, it\u2019s probably worth it to do the reparative work of giving her a call, telling her you don\u2019t all hate her, and telling her you wish she would relax and just enjoy being part of the family, because then she\u2019d discover that everyone does like her and that everything is okay, because the only reason she feels like an \u201coutsider\u201d is that everyone feels tense around her because she is always looking for conflict.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously really struggling and has been for a long time. While her efforts to start a dialogue weren\u2019t well executed, you have to appreciate that she tried. It would have been better for her to start counseling and maybe confront her dad privately, but you would obviously isolate her from the family if you publicly humiliate her after she\u2019s been open about how hurt she is. You can\u2019t pretend to be surprised that public ally humiliating someone and teaming up on her like children would cause her to withdraw.\n\nShe was out of line. You had valid points but your approach was cruel. The real issue here is probably her dad. No one is managing this well.", "ESH. I get why it's annoying but laughing at and humiliating her isn't going to help anyone. This kind of behaviour of hers rarely comes out of nowhere, as she said, she's trying to start a dialogue and her issues are being ignored by the people that are supposed to care about her. \nBella sucks for failing to realise that sometimes people just don't care about what you're going through. Perhaps isolating herself from all of you would be good for her. \nAlso, your parents replacing a photo of her with one of you was really sh*tty. Perhaps her point about you being chosen over her all the time might actually have some ground...", "Is this why therapists are always pegged as having the most personal issues? They first gain interest in the subject in order to psychoanalyze their own lives.", "NTA\n\nLook, if she feels like her dad and brothers replaced her with you then she should be angry/take it up with *them*. There is no need for her to attack you at Christmas over *your parents* choice of photo placement. \n\n You were a child when your parents got together and it is is no way your fault that she feels replaced. \n\nI have two bio sisters, my parents are constantly swapping around pictures of us from various important functions graduations, birthdays, weddings, etc, etc, \u2026 it\u2019s just what happens when you have multiple kids!

The main person to blame is the dad who sounds like he did nothing to help her.", "The problem is, she\u2019s trying to start a dialogue with people that don\u2019t want to talk, and she knows that so she just talks to herself.

What it does is inform the people around them about how to interact. If someone is constantly insecure and feeling replaced by you, you yelling at them isn\u2019t the correct response. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know that.", "Absolutely agree!", "She's trying to start a dialogue with her family, and the way the family intersects. Telling her her feelings about the family are irrelevant and you're not willing to discuss them is effectively isolating her. It sounds like she might have gone on too strong, but why are you surprised she's cut you all after you all told her you don't care about how she feels, and that her saying how she feels is annoying? \n\nAnd the replaced picture is a massive asshole move.", "No, but the psychoanalyzing shit at 30. \n\nYou can be informed of the situation based upon context but there\u2019s a basic human reality in that situation, which is everyone\u2019s temper. \n\nI agree with you on the yelling though. Unproductive and  absolutely incorrect. But regardless of trauma, the other behavior isn\u2019t correct either and she needs to be aware of it and deal with it. Because it\u2019s clearly affecting not only her but also the rest of her family.\n\nEdit: also just saw your fair Lol. I didn\u2019t even know that was a title one could acquire. Hilarious.", "Except it sounds like they\u2019ve tried other means of communicating to her that they\u2019re not interested in  the conversation psychology about them she wouldn\u2019t listen.

I also think the OP should show step-siblings some empathy.  And honestly, it's the parents' fault for allowing this to go on so long that it's now affected their children's adult relationships.  Toxic parenting at its finest here. Your father obviously is aware that your sister has had these issues for years, knowing that he replaced her picture on the wall. Why not have both up?\n\nIf they all felt this way, if you valued her relationship, then you would sit down to work it out. Expressing the feels from all sides. But how this family handled this shows how valid the step sister feels are.

It sounds like they wanted her to read their mind and only actually said no thanks to engaging a time or two which isn\u2019t the same as specifically asking an individual to stop bringing something up to them moving forward.", "Ohhh shit, that was actually totally my bad.

People are just glossing over that.

And it'd be solely due to her behavior. It's okay if she wants to have a conversation. But then she actually needs to have a CONVERSATION, not just throw commentary out into the air or talk one-sidedly while everyone else is simply wrong.\n\nShe does need a therapist.

Sounds like she could use a good psychologist or therapist.", "NTA but leaning towards NAH.\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong at all.  Bella is still having a hard time with her parents\u2019 divorce.  She badly needs therapy, and maybe you can offer to go with her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, these sites/people where she's picking up he pop psychology are telling her she's a victim and deserves some kind of retribution, while demonizing and diagnosing your family. She really does need therapy.", "NTA. I be love people who *think* they are experts because they read books about stuff.", "NTA It needed to be said, her brothers reactions verify that. She needs to get counseling/therapy for herself. She very clearly needs help, but she has to do it for herself. She is not punishing you by isolating herself, think of it as doing you a favor.", "But...you were just trying to start a dialogue?\n\nNTA", "Yta didn't mean to isolate her.. lol", "INFO: how did you take her place in your husband\u2019s life? Were they together first or something?", "NTA. she sounds like she has a lot of unresolved issues from the past and is projecting that on you and other family members she has resentment for. I hope she ends up seeing a therapist so she can be happy and secure with herself. I would say N A H but she\u2019s 30 and not still 16.", "INFO: did you talk to her about it gently in past, and encourage her to see someone?\n\nI hate to say it, y t a. Lightly.\n\nShe needed it to hear it like you said yourself and everyone agreed.\n\nI think she didn\u2019t need to hear it like this. You did effectively confirm her fears to her, knowing her fear is her fathers abandonment and being replaced.\n\nLastly, while I get you feel blamed maybe. She actually didn\u2019t blame you - she\u2019s speaking about her dad. Asking for some acknowledgement and commiseration.\n\nI would\u2019ve told her too but tried to gently before this already since it seems you are very aware. Hence my question.\n\nAlso saying go to therapy to her likely feels like you\u2019re saying she\u2019s imagining this. I\u2019d acknowledge what you say here- she feels alienated since her dad moved on and that\u2019s understandable, you\u2019ve seen it right? And she can get support for that from someone who knows how to deal with it, and you all are there for her. You (rightly) do not see how hashing out the past is solving anything given everyone has tried listening for so long, and it\u2019s not helping her to date.\n\nShe clearly wants to be part of the family, I\u2019d think maybe you can still salvage it and get her help if your family can get on the same page and handle it with compassionate care. \n\nHer dad did remarry and since then she has been the outcast from what you describe. Has anyone acknowledged where she maybe rightfully entitled to her feelings? I think she will be more receptive to get help as a solution than to blame it on her if all of you acknowledge this and only this (not go in directions she can misinterpret, just listen and affirm you hear her - not get into if you see it the same, your experience is different like you described).", "NTA.  Sounds like it needed to be said.", "So what's her username so we can go laugh at her comments on this sub?\n\nI kid, I kid.  But 100% NTA.  It sounds like she's still at least partial stuck in mental adolescence and hasn't matured past the difficulties of becoming a blended family in the teenage years.", "NTA.  What do you mean isolate her from the family, she was doing that all along?  You said that's all she talks about.  So now she's gone and ya'll don't have to hear it.  I see it as a WIN-WIN for all.  Do you really think she would stop or change if she came back into the group?  That doesn't sound like her personality from your comments.", "Im always amused when insufferable people don't realize they're insufferable.", "NTA, she needs to see a shrink and stop trying to be her own therapist", "NTA It's been 14 years. Plenty of time for her to either have it out with your stepdad or a therapist or both, but you're not obligated to be the target of her feelings forever.", "NTA", "Your father is the AH. You are NTA.", "You didn't isolate her from the family, she did. She left the gathering early, she stopped participating in the group chat. Etc. \n\nDon't  forget, you don't  control what she does!", "There's one thing that stuck out for me.\n\nINFO for OP: Why did Bella say you replaced her in your husband's life? Why would she say that?", "Agreed.  Someone as a non-professionsl with an agenda referencing psychology journals is a bad combination.  This is a person who will selectively pick out information to suit her agenda.", "I doubt she's reading psychology journals. She's probably just saying that so her family doesn't laugh at her for getting this stuff of Facebook, or tick tok or Instagram.", "You said what everyone else was thinking, NTA, with defiance. Someone else would have said it sooner or later if it wasn't you.", ">NTA - You didn't isolate her, she isolated herself. \n\nI was going to respond to OP with literally this word-for-word.\n\nSounds to me like Bella doesn't know how to express her hurt feelings regarding the change in her family dynamics, and is genuinely on the psychoanalysis binge in order to generate a dialogue where she can talk about it.", "Oh wow, I didn\u2019t think anyone would respond like this and I like it. Why not a group family therapy", "This is the best answer.", "I genuinely don\u2019t know what she could point to. Maybe at a stretch, I saw her dad more because I stayed with her dad and my mum for a while, when she had a job and didn\u2019t live with them. But that\u2019s not favouritism, really. I have my own dad as well so it\u2019s not like my stepfather ever stepped up to be a father to me. I\u2019m not sure how I became the \u201cfavourite\u201d child in her head when I\u2019m not even his child.\n\nI didn\u2019t live with them full time when I was a teen, but I know from when I was over there that she would just stay in her room, never participated in \u201cfamily\u201d stuff, so she\u2019s not as close to us now again that\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s fault. Her dad probably could have made more of an effort with her, or got her therapy, but he\u2019s not really in tune with mental health. \n\nSo, I don\u2019t know what her version would say, but from what she\u2019s said it\u2019s not a version the rest of us would necessarily recognise.", "Agreed with this completely.", "No, God no. \n\nMy stepdad owns a 3 bed flat in the city, that Bella was living in a few years ago. She lived there rent free but she had to let any of us other kids or parents use the spare bedrooms if we were in town. So, I went there one day, and she had people over, one of whom was my husband, who was a friend of her friend. They had met a couple of times, never dated, my husband was never interested in her.", "I\u2019m glad someone mentioned that - like, if you know there are issues with you daughter and step-daughter getting along, and your daughter is very vocal about you replacing her with her step-sister, I would think you\u2019d think a little more deeply about things like swapping an actual photo of your daughter with one of your step-daughter. \n\nNot excusing bella\u2019s behaviour and I do think NTA, but I wonder if there\u2019s even a tiny shred of truth in that part of the family dynamic, even if it\u2019s unconscious or overcompensating for OP being the single step-sibling joining with three bio siblings.", "My in-laws regularly move older photos to other spots to make room for current ones. He who sends the photos is the one whose photos are most prominent. If she wants more photos up maybe she should send some. I am not at all bothered that the in laws have mostly pictures of the grandchildren in the spots of prominence. If I send a picture they will put it up.", "How old is the graduation photo though? If it's recent I see your point, bit if it's older from say from high school, it was due for a downgrade.", "Right? The dad is an AH for that.", "She's 30. He can't get her to therapy, that's a choice she has to make as an adult", "Come now.  Her dad isn\u2019t a \u201cmassive AH\u201d for replacing a graduation photo of him and his daughter with a wedding photo of him, his wife and his stepdaughter at the stepdaughter\u2019s wedding.  \n\nOP\u2019s step sister\u2019s feeling hurt is valid, but I\u2019m certain her father didn\u2019t do this to hurt her intentionally.  \n\nNTA", "As an adult, it isn\u2019t rational to become that upset over minor sentimental objects to the point that you accuse your family of trying to replace you. It isn\u2019t dismissing her feelings if her family wasn\u2019t aware of the association.", "Rearranging your photos is not asshole behavior. People do that all the time. It's not like stepsis got put in a closet or something, her photo is still up.\n\nShe's an adult woman, if she still has trauma from her parent's divorce then she is responsible for seeking treatment for it at this point. It's hard not to dismiss someone's hurt feelings when they treat one photo being moved like they've been disowned. She's acting ridiculous and the only person aggravating her is herself. She'll get better when she takes some accountability for her own behavior. Yes, parents getting divorced is a shitty thing to deal with, but she'd rather be the perpetual victim than take the steps needed to move on from it.\n\nI doubt she'll get better. She'll just find some other group to feel unfairly excluded from - friend groups, colleagues, communities - and continue to assign nefarious roles to other people while never examining her own issues.", "I think it\u2019s a bit unfair to say her dad doesn\u2019t love her. He\u2019s not parent of the year to any of his kids, but he does love them. He has a dinosaur attitude to emotional well-being and that gets in the way of his communication. He could have done more for her, for sure, but I wouldn\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t love her.", "How is she experiencing trauma at 30 because her dad started a new relationship almost half her life ago?", "I think the removal of the picture is really telling, though. Not OPs fault but at this point parents sure know she felt replaced. Why make matters worse?", "Her parents aren\u2019t going to win any awards, I\u2019ll be honest. I don\u2019t know her mother well but she does seem to have some \u201cunhelpful\u201d behaviours. My stepdad is a good guy, loves his kids, but he\u2019s old school, he doesn\u2019t put as much as he should in mental health. That said, I don\u2019t think he sidelined her for me. Bella likes to say I\u2019m his favourite but actually one of my stepbrothers is, and the rest of us all joke about it constantly.", "Bella has had more than 15 years to get over it or seek therapy. It is not OP's responsibility to attend therapy with a grown adult that she's never been close to.", "No. I explained in more detail in another comment, but basically they had a mutual friend. When I met him she\u2019d met a couple of times before. They never dated, he was never interested in her, they\u2019d never spoken outside of gatherings with mutual friends", "Uh... *and here, on AITA, specifically*.", "It's unbelievable how much the word narcissist is thrown around tbh. I'm estranged from my mother and whenever I discuss issues in appropriate groups, I'll get supportive statements from people, which is nice, but they usually say something to the effect of \"narc parents gonna narc!\" And like. My mother has a myriad of issues that led to my estrangement. She is not narcissistic in any way, shape, or form. That's the last description on earth that matches her issues. Not every shitty parent is a narcissist.", "Reddit looooves to misdiagnose (and demonize) narcissists, its like the app's main \"thing\" right now.

OP said the parents divorced and married when the sisters were both 16, but now they're both 30? And Bella is still running around trying to blame everyone around her for.... what? \nBella seems a bit.... in need of some professional help instead of just yelling into the void.", "I mean, her dad did replace a picture of them with one of you and him. That's not your fault, but it sounds like her dad definitely did and does treat her as less than you. You even admit he could have made more of an effort or at the very least gotten her help. You weren't necessarily an ass, but you didn't handle this with any maturity. You kicked someone already down.", "I think taking you at your word for everything that leaves it at ESH for me and it does seem like maybe the best choice for your step sister is to distance herself.\n\nFrom your other comments it seems like she has lots of pain from the past but none of you want to talk about it so you think she should talk to a therapist who would care about what she is saying.\n\nI mean you aren't obligated to care but that is still an attitude from you guys that implies distance is best all round. She is probably still clinging to a hope that one day you can all finally have an open discussion with each other, and its just not going to happen. She needs to let go of the idea of ever getting validation or an equal level of comradery from you guys, and you guys want to not have her bringing up all this stuff all the time. \n\nIt seems like she never got to talk with her family about her unhappiness at the time, and doesn't get to now either because that would be \"dredging up the past\". That can really suck for a person and it seems like she just isn't capable of pretending her feelings aren't there. Some people aren't.", "Yeah I\u2019m going to bet good money she was interested in him though.", "He could have got her to therapy when she was younger. I mean, there\u2019s obviously a lot of resentment and trauma there. Probably should have started as soon as her parents were divorcing.", "You really missed almost everything I said. It just really drives home how little you care about her. I get she has been a drag the entire time you\u2019ve known her. And no one is owed a relationship. But people are owed respect and common decency. She may be annoying but she isn\u2019t cruel. You and the rest of your family have been cruel to her. You all have been gaslighting her for years and she\u2019s finally had enough of the pain. \n\nI\u2019m really curious, have any of you reached out to her at all? Or are you all having a big party to celebrate that she\u2019s finally gone?", "Also, I do t think it\u2019s unfair to say her dad doesn\u2019t love her. Based on your post and your comments there is not a shred of evidence that he does, in fact, love her. Actions show people how they really feel, and his actions/inactions are screaming he doesn\u2019t love her.", "No push back on anything else? Her brothers don't love her, and they made it pretty clear that they find her annoying, but how dare she not talk to them and her emotionally neglectful father!", "Cus she felt some type of way as teenager when it happened and it was never addressed", "Well, OP mentioned other people asking Bella to stop trying to talk to the family about psychoanalysis, but not OP specifically talking to her about this issue of comparing the two of them. I think there was potential for OP to sit down with her step-sister and parents and work this out more productively. \n\nBut as I said, Bella was clearly over the line, and it was certainly not inappropriate for OP to respond as she did. So I agree that doing something to respond to this was long overdue and even if this wasn't a perfect response, expecting perfection from people in situations like this is insane.", "You don't think he sidelined her for you but clearly she does e.g. by removing a photo of her and replacing it with a photo of you. She's very obviously hurting and has been for a long time and while she should potentially have \"gotten over it\", by your own admission her parents don't care and you just told her the rest of you don't care either and they all laughed at her. I think the parents are the worst here but in general no-one is winning any awards.", "Because they aren\u2019t hurt by it. Your not hurt. She is.\n\nBiggest AH response is always to say the past is the past and that others need to get over it.", "That's pretty selfish of your brothers and really sad that she's reached out again and again and all of you have just ignored her. She clearly has unresolved issues and as her family you all should care enough about that to go through them with her. You all, especially her dad, should want her to be okay. Why not suggest family therapy or something? \nI'm sure she's getting on your nerves because YOU aren't interested in her but people don't always act in a pleasant way when they've been hurt. \nI don't know, I just feel like all of you could do with showing a little more compassion and empathy. Or I could be wrong and shes just a spoiled brat.\nFor what it's worth, there's a similar issue in my family with my younger sister, except she's the one that spent years abusing and hurting all of us but particularly me. She disappeared for years then came back with a surprise baby and we've all gotten together to support her. Now she's got her life together but all the hurt that she caused hasn't gone away. Problem is that whenever i try to raise it, SHE doesn't want to \"dredge up the past\" so eventually i gave up. So we're pleasant to each other and get along okay, but I don't have much love for her and without that very important conversation where she acknowledges what she did and apologizes, I cant move forward to have a good relationship with her. It's going to be polite and civil forever unlike my relationship with my other sister which is warm and very close. \nAt the end of the day, all this is about how much you value your sister and her well being. If she's been hurt by her family, however unintentionally, she should be allowed to air that and not just be shut down because you all don't want to deal with it.\nThat's just my two cents. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "She\u2019s not trying to start a dialogue. She\u2019s trying to dictate a narrative", "That too but if her family has hurt her they should be a part of that dialogue. However if they don't want to then she should respect that, get her own therapy to accept that she isn't going to get the closure she wants and move on. Not everyone is going to care about your feelings sometimes, not even family, it's a hard lesson to learn but maybe her creating this distance is the start of her accepting that.", "I only offered it as a way to get Bella the help she needs and as a way to maybe build a relationship between the two of them, if that\u2019s what they would like.", "You trying to gaslight me bruh?", "That's it, the only solution here is divorce!", "Woah there stop making sense..FULL STOP cause I said so", "Yea that shits crazy people find a concept and just attach it to every damn thing. I also hate whenever somebody does some weird shit its all \u201care they autistic or do they have adhd\u201d give me a damn break stop insulting people that actually have these conditions, sometimes hell most times people are just assholes or just strange/weird and it has nothing to do with a diagnosis.", "What pisses me off is that a lot of people who get armchair diagnosed as narcissists, come from families with actual narcissists and so, they've picked up enabling coping mechanisms and small narc personality traits known as 'fleas'. They themselves aren't narcs, but they grew up around it and it's been normalized so they have some of the behaviors but not the diagnosed personality.", "She probably was.
