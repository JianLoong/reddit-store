Her dad and my mum got together when we were 16.Bella was very upset about her parents' divorce and was very hostile to my mother so obviously, she and I weren't going to be on the best of terms, and as we got older we just didn't bond. I always got along well with her two brothers, Jake and Max, and we're still close.\n\nOver the last year, Bella has been reading a lot about psychology and is always bringing up what she thinks everyone else's issues are. She will send articles about narcissistic parents, golden children, scapegoats, triangulation, etc. to our family group chat with messages like \"@(sibling) this is you\" or \"isn't this like Mum\" (their bio mum). Jake, Max, and my stepdad all say it annoys them that all she wants to talk about it the past. She is like this in person, too. No matter how many times we smile and nod and sometimes even say we are not interested in armchair therapy from her, she just says she has a right to express her feelings and she's trying to start a dialogue. Part of her whole thing is deciding that her dad basically replaced her with me because she reminds him of her mother, and that because he loves my mum and never loved hers, I am his favourite/golden child. \n\nThis all came to a head over Christmas, when Bella noticed the family photos my parents had on a shelf in their dining room. She asked where the picture of her and her dad at her graduation was, and he said they'd moved it to make room for a picture of me and him and my mum at my wedding, and her graduation photo was now in the lounge. Bella scoffed and sneered 'of course'. Over lunch, I was talking about a photoshoot I was working on, and Bella chimed in about how our parents will probably replace more photos of her with ones from my photoshoot. I told her this makes no sense because the photos aren't even going to be of me, and she just said it didn't matter, she was invisible when I was around and that I took her place in everyone's life - her dad's, her brothers', even my husband.\n\nAt this point I just snapped and said that that was an absurd accusation when she makes every family conversation about herself, and while we all appreciate she is deeply hurt by a lot of things, we're all sick of being psychoanalysed. I said that her obsession with me was ridiculous, because the only person I've ever head compare us is her, and that she needs to find someone qualified and appropriate to discuss these hurt feelings with and stop suffocating us all with her feelings because we're all bored. Jake just started laughing and Max shouted 'thank God someone said it', but Bella burst into tears and left the table. She went home early and has since removed herself from the group chat and isn't talking to her dad or brothers. While I stand by the points I made, I didn't mean to isolate her from her family, so I'm starting to wonder if I'm the AH.", "created_utc": 1673014041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104v26p/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_we_are_all_bored/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Candidly, I can see why she felt that way. It must have been painful for a sixteen year old girl to see her father - and her brothers - adjust so quickly to a new family dynamic, with a brand new sister her own age, while she was struggling. \n\nThat said, her way of communicating her feelings clearly crossed a line with everyone. No one likes being psychoanalyzed or told regularly that they\u2019re a golden child/narcissist, and I bet that pushed her even further away from your family unit. You\u2019re not TA for snapping after years of those remarks. \n\nBella has very clearly been in a pain for a long time, and doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s part of her own family. I think that should be the main takeaway here. The easy thing to do is cut people out who go against the grain, but Bella seems like she\u2019s been asking for help and change, albeit with armchair therapy. If your family cares about her, I think it\u2019s time to try and listen.", "NTA.  Although, as someone else here already stated, you could have been more diplomatic.   I'm sure her family loves her very much, but it does sound as if her brothers and father *like* you more than they like her. All the psychoanalysis in the world isn't going to change one simple fact: People gravitate towards those whom they feel good to be around.  People avoid those that are unpleasant to be around. She's been told that no one appreciates her psychoanalysis.  It's really not much different from finger pointing and name calling.  I think it's really important that she get some help.  I don't think her relationships will improve much until she can start owning that she is, in fact, responsible for her own happiness and won't gain any points for creating stress and aggravation for everyone she's around.", "NTA", "NAH \n\nShe needed that wake up call and her dad seriously needs to convince her into getting therapy. She could def harm herself and that would be tragic. She's obviously hurting and channeling it down the wrong path. I think everyone should seek family counseling. Something has remained broken and the resentment isn't just going to go away on its own.", "NTA. In time she might come around, but if not then it will be to her brothers and dad to work on it. As for you just stay on the sidelines, as she will probably not listen to you.", "NAH\n\nOP, Bella is 30 yrs old. She needs to get herself into therapy to figure out more effective ways to deal with her issues. \n\nAt this point, she may be embarrased and you could reach out and let her know you didn't mean for her to remove herself from the family, but you  (and others based on the comments) simply wanted her to stop the armchair psychology. \n\nIf you feel you can as a stepsibling suggest she rejoin the group chat, but encourage her to participate in other ways. Also, privately if you feel you can, suggest she start some actual therapy for her issues.", "ESH. She\u2019s clearly experiencing trauma- you handled this very poorly. She was being annoying absolutely. But your response was also bad. And the guys who laughed and agreed are also wrong. \n\nNot a single person in this story sounds like they did anything positive or productive.", "ESH. \n\nBella clearly has some stuff she needs to work through. You all should have been encouraging her into therapy rather than just sitting there fuming. If you\u2019d collectively done something about this sooner this blow up likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\nIn particular her dad should have stepped in and discussed things. Also, knowing that Bella feels she\u2019s been replaced, it was tactless in the extreme to say her photo of a milestone event had been moved to make room for yours. \n\nBella lacks insight and manners. She should have sought therapy and dropped the topic with you all when it was clear that you weren\u2019t interested.", "NTA, but almost ESH. It would have been better to say this to her alone, so that it wasn\u2019t a humiliating moment for her. \n\nAlso, since she\u2019s someone you will probably have to be connected to for a long time, it\u2019s probably worth it to do the reparative work of giving her a call, telling her you don\u2019t all hate her, and telling her you wish she would relax and just enjoy being part of the family, because then she\u2019d discover that everyone does like her and that everything is okay, because the only reason she feels like an \u201coutsider\u201d is that everyone feels tense around her because she is always looking for conflict.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously really struggling and has been for a long time. While her efforts to start a dialogue weren\u2019t well executed, you have to appreciate that she tried. It would have been better for her to start counseling and maybe confront her dad privately, but you would obviously isolate her from the family if you publicly humiliate her after she\u2019s been open about how hurt she is. You can\u2019t pretend to be surprised that public ally humiliating someone and teaming up on her like children would cause her to withdraw.\n\nShe was out of line. You had valid points but your approach was cruel. The real issue here is probably her dad. No one is managing this well.", "ESH. I get why it's annoying but laughing at and humiliating her isn't going to help anyone. This kind of behaviour of hers rarely comes out of nowhere, as she said, she's trying to start a dialogue and her issues are being ignored by the people that are supposed to care about her. \nBella sucks for failing to realise that sometimes people just don't care about what you're going through. Perhaps isolating herself from all of you would be good for her. \nAlso, your parents replacing a photo of her with one of you was really sh*tty. Perhaps her point about you being chosen over her all the time might actually have some ground...", "Is this why therapists are always pegged as having the most personal issues? They first gain interest in the subject in order to psychoanalyze their own lives.", "NTA\n\nLook, if she feels like her dad and brothers replaced her with you then she should be angry/take it up with *them*. There is no need for her to attack you at Christmas over *your parents* choice of photo placement. \n\n You were a child when your parents got together and it is is no way your fault that she feels replaced. \n\nI have two bio sisters, my parents are constantly swapping around pictures of us from various important functions graduations, birthdays, weddings, etc, etc, \u2026 it\u2019s just what happens when you have multiple kids! They also didn\u2019t take her picture down, they just moved it.", "Psychology journals\u2026probably more like reading memes on social media. The term narcissist is soooo overused on SM.", "It\u2019s been 14 years\u2026the time for kindness, especially when they\u2019ve asked her to stop doing it, is over. Sometimes people don\u2019t understand kindness.", "Trauma does not give someone a pass to act however they want. Especially when it a 30yo adult, you have to deal with your own problems. It\u2019s not up to everyone else to cater to them.", "Sounds like the dad never got her therapy after the divorce. The main person to blame is the dad who sounds like he did nothing to help her.", "The problem is, she\u2019s trying to start a dialogue with people that don\u2019t want to talk, and she knows that so she just talks to herself. I\u2019m not even counting myself really, but my brothers have said time and time again that they have no interest in dredging up the past.", "She needs to start dialogue with a therapist and work out the unhealthy obsession she\u2019s been carrying around for 14 years.", "It absolutely doesn\u2019t give anyone a pass. What it does is inform the people around them about how to interact. If someone is constantly insecure and feeling replaced by you, you yelling at them isn\u2019t the correct response. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know that.", "Absolutely agree!", "She's trying to start a dialogue with her family, and the way the family intersects. Telling her her feelings about the family are irrelevant and you're not willing to discuss them is effectively isolating her. It sounds like she might have gone on too strong, but why are you surprised she's cut you all after you all told her you don't care about how she feels, and that her saying how she feels is annoying? \n\nAnd the replaced picture is a massive asshole move.", "No, but the psychoanalyzing shit at 30. \n\nYou can be informed of the situation based upon context but there\u2019s a basic human reality in that situation, which is everyone\u2019s temper. \n\nI agree with you on the yelling though. Unproductive and  absolutely incorrect. But regardless of trauma, the other behavior isn\u2019t correct either and she needs to be aware of it and deal with it. Because it\u2019s clearly affecting not only her but also the rest of her family.\n\nEdit: also just saw your fair Lol. I didn\u2019t even know that was a title one could acquire. Hilarious.", "Except it sounds like they\u2019ve tried other means of communicating to her that they\u2019re not interested in  the conversation psychology about them she wouldn\u2019t listen. This is one of those times where sure it sucks and it wasn\u2019t ideal, but that Bella didn\u2019t respond to lower intensity requests and it finally built up to an intensity of communication that Bella would respond to.", "I agree it only made the problem worse.   I also think the OP should show step-siblings some empathy.  And honestly, it's the parents' fault for allowing this to go on so long that it's now affected their children's adult relationships.  Toxic parenting at its finest here. Your father obviously is aware that your sister has had these issues for years, knowing that he replaced her picture on the wall. Why not have both up?\n\nIf they all felt this way, if you valued her relationship, then you would sit down to work it out. Expressing the feels from all sides. But how this family handled this shows how valid the step sister feels are. Sneering and talking behind her back only makes this all worse.", "What part of \u201cESH\u201d makes you think I\u2019m saying that her behavior is okay? It\u2019s very clearly not.", "I wouldn\u2019t really say that \u201csmile and nod and sometimes even say we aren\u2019t interested\u201d is enough of a backstory of trying to communicate the point to validate yelling like this, but maybe I just feel different about the importance of effective and respectful communication than some people. \n\nIf the post was written to drastically undersell the amount of stern but polite conversations they\u2019ve had directly asking her not to talk to them about this, then I could absolutely consider that, but the way it\u2019s currently written doesn\u2019t seem to me like they actually tried to communicate clearly with her. It sounds like they wanted her to read their mind and only actually said no thanks to engaging a time or two which isn\u2019t the same as specifically asking an individual to stop bringing something up to them moving forward.", "Ohhh shit, that was actually totally my bad. I replied to your comment from notifications and mistakenly thought you voted N T A. \n\nMy apologies for being argumentative. We just agree on the matter lol.", "Hahaha all good!"]}
