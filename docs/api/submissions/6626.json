Jake, Max, and my stepdad all say it annoys them that all she wants to talk about it the past. She is like this in person, too. No matter how many times we smile and nod and sometimes even say we are not interested in armchair therapy from her, she just says she has a right to express her feelings and she's trying to start a dialogue. Part of her whole thing is deciding that her dad basically replaced her with me because she reminds him of her mother, and that because he loves my mum and never loved hers, I am his favourite/golden child. \n\nThis all came to a head over Christmas, when Bella noticed the family photos my parents had on a shelf in their dining room. She asked where the picture of her and her dad at her graduation was, and he said they'd moved it to make room for a picture of me and him and my mum at my wedding, and her graduation photo was now in the lounge. Bella scoffed and sneered 'of course'. Over lunch, I was talking about a photoshoot I was working on, and Bella chimed in about how our parents will probably replace more photos of her with ones from my photoshoot. I told her this makes no sense because the photos aren't even going to be of me, and she just said it didn't matter, she was invisible when I was around and that I took her place in everyone's life - her dad's, her brothers', even my husband.\n\nAt this point I just snapped and said that that was an absurd accusation when she makes every family conversation about herself, and while we all appreciate she is deeply hurt by a lot of things, we're all sick of being psychoanalysed. I said that her obsession with me was ridiculous, because the only person I've ever head compare us is her, and that she needs to find someone qualified and appropriate to discuss these hurt feelings with and stop suffocating us all with her feelings because we're all bored. Jake just started laughing and Max shouted 'thank God someone said it', but Bella burst into tears and left the table.

Candidly, I can see why she felt that way. It must have been painful for a sixteen year old girl to see her father - and her brothers - adjust so quickly to a new family dynamic, with a brand new sister her own age, while she was struggling. \n\nThat said, her way of communicating her feelings clearly crossed a line with everyone. No one likes being psychoanalyzed or told regularly that they\u2019re a golden child/narcissist, and I bet that pushed her even further away from your family unit. You\u2019re not TA for snapping after years of those remarks. \n\nBella has very clearly been in a pain for a long time, and doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s part of her own family. I think that should be the main takeaway here. The easy thing to do is cut people out who go against the grain, but Bella seems like she\u2019s been asking for help and change, albeit with armchair therapy. If your family cares about her, I think it\u2019s time to try and listen.", "NTA.  Although, as someone else here already stated, you could have been more diplomatic.   I'm sure her family loves her very much, but it does sound as if her brothers and father *like* you more than they like her. All the psychoanalysis in the world isn't going to change one simple fact: People gravitate towards those whom they feel good to be around.  People avoid those that are unpleasant to be around. She's been told that no one appreciates her psychoanalysis.  It's really not much different from finger pointing and name calling.  I think it's really important that she get some help.  I don't think her relationships will improve much until she can start owning that she is, in fact, responsible for her own happiness and won't gain any points for creating stress and aggravation for everyone she's around.", "NTA", "NAH \n\nShe needed that wake up call and her dad seriously needs to convince her into getting therapy. She could def harm herself and that would be tragic. She's obviously hurting and channeling it down the wrong path. I think everyone should seek family counseling. Something has remained broken and the resentment isn't just going to go away on its own.", "NTA. In time she might come around, but if not then it will be to her brothers and dad to work on it. As for you just stay on the sidelines, as she will probably not listen to you.", "NAH\n\nOP, Bella is 30 yrs old. She needs to get herself into therapy to figure out more effective ways to deal with her issues. \n\nAt this point, she may be embarrased and you could reach out and let her know you didn't mean for her to remove herself from the family, but you  (and others based on the comments) simply wanted her to stop the armchair psychology. \n\nIf you feel you can as a stepsibling suggest she rejoin the group chat, but encourage her to participate in other ways. Also, privately if you feel you can, suggest she start some actual therapy for her issues.", "ESH. She\u2019s clearly experiencing trauma- you handled this very poorly. She was being annoying absolutely. But your response was also bad. And the guys who laughed and agreed are also wrong. \n\nNot a single person in this story sounds like they did anything positive or productive.", "ESH. \n\nBella clearly has some stuff she needs to work through. You all should have been encouraging her into therapy rather than just sitting there fuming. If you\u2019d collectively done something about this sooner this blow up likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\nIn particular her dad should have stepped in and discussed things. Also, knowing that Bella feels she\u2019s been replaced, it was tactless in the extreme to say her photo of a milestone event had been moved to make room for yours. \n\nBella lacks insight and manners. She should have sought therapy and dropped the topic with you all when it was clear that you weren\u2019t interested.", "NTA, but almost ESH. It would have been better to say this to her alone, so that it wasn\u2019t a humiliating moment for her. \n\nAlso, since she\u2019s someone you will probably have to be connected to for a long time, it\u2019s probably worth it to do the reparative work of giving her a call, telling her you don\u2019t all hate her, and telling her you wish she would relax and just enjoy being part of the family, because then she\u2019d discover that everyone does like her and that everything is okay, because the only reason she feels like an \u201coutsider\u201d is that everyone feels tense around her because she is always looking for conflict.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously really struggling and has been for a long time. While her efforts to start a dialogue weren\u2019t well executed, you have to appreciate that she tried. It would have been better for her to start counseling and maybe confront her dad privately, but you would obviously isolate her from the family if you publicly humiliate her after she\u2019s been open about how hurt she is. You can\u2019t pretend to be surprised that public ally humiliating someone and teaming up on her like children would cause her to withdraw.\n\nShe was out of line. You had valid points but your approach was cruel. The real issue here is probably her dad. No one is managing this well.", "ESH. I get why it's annoying but laughing at and humiliating her isn't going to help anyone. This kind of behaviour of hers rarely comes out of nowhere, as she said, she's trying to start a dialogue and her issues are being ignored by the people that are supposed to care about her. \nBella sucks for failing to realise that sometimes people just don't care about what you're going through. Perhaps isolating herself from all of you would be good for her. \nAlso, your parents replacing a photo of her with one of you was really sh*tty. Perhaps her point about you being chosen over her all the time might actually have some ground...", "Is this why therapists are always pegged as having the most personal issues? They first gain interest in the subject in order to psychoanalyze their own lives.", "NTA\n\nLook, if she feels like her dad and brothers replaced her with you then she should be angry/take it up with *them*. There is no need for her to attack you at Christmas over *your parents* choice of photo placement. \n\n You were a child when your parents got together and it is is no way your fault that she feels replaced. \n\nI have two bio sisters, my parents are constantly swapping around pictures of us from various important functions graduations, birthdays, weddings, etc, etc, \u2026 it\u2019s just what happens when you have multiple kids!

The main person to blame is the dad who sounds like he did nothing to help her.", "The problem is, she\u2019s trying to start a dialogue with people that don\u2019t want to talk, and she knows that so she just talks to herself.

What it does is inform the people around them about how to interact. If someone is constantly insecure and feeling replaced by you, you yelling at them isn\u2019t the correct response. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know that.", "Absolutely agree!", "She's trying to start a dialogue with her family, and the way the family intersects. Telling her her feelings about the family are irrelevant and you're not willing to discuss them is effectively isolating her. It sounds like she might have gone on too strong, but why are you surprised she's cut you all after you all told her you don't care about how she feels, and that her saying how she feels is annoying? \n\nAnd the replaced picture is a massive asshole move.", "No, but the psychoanalyzing shit at 30. \n\nYou can be informed of the situation based upon context but there\u2019s a basic human reality in that situation, which is everyone\u2019s temper. \n\nI agree with you on the yelling though. Unproductive and  absolutely incorrect. But regardless of trauma, the other behavior isn\u2019t correct either and she needs to be aware of it and deal with it. Because it\u2019s clearly affecting not only her but also the rest of her family.\n\nEdit: also just saw your fair Lol. I didn\u2019t even know that was a title one could acquire. Hilarious.", "Except it sounds like they\u2019ve tried other means of communicating to her that they\u2019re not interested in  the conversation psychology about them she wouldn\u2019t listen.

I also think the OP should show step-siblings some empathy.  And honestly, it's the parents' fault for allowing this to go on so long that it's now affected their children's adult relationships.  Toxic parenting at its finest here. Your father obviously is aware that your sister has had these issues for years, knowing that he replaced her picture on the wall. Why not have both up?\n\nIf they all felt this way, if you valued her relationship, then you would sit down to work it out. Expressing the feels from all sides. But how this family handled this shows how valid the step sister feels are.

It sounds like they wanted her to read their mind and only actually said no thanks to engaging a time or two which isn\u2019t the same as specifically asking an individual to stop bringing something up to them moving forward.", "Ohhh shit, that was actually totally my bad.

People are just glossing over that.  And I don't think this has been the only incident. \n\nI think Bella has been using the psychoanalysis as a way of trying to communicate how she's felt over the years.

And it'd be solely due to her behavior. It's okay if she wants to have a conversation. But then she actually needs to have a CONVERSATION, not just throw commentary out into the air or talk one-sidedly while everyone else is simply wrong.\n\nShe does need a therapist.

Sounds like she could use a good psychologist or therapist.", "NTA but leaning towards NAH.\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong at all.

She badly needs therapy, and maybe you can offer to go with her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, these sites/people where she's picking up he pop psychology are telling her she's a victim and deserves some kind of retribution, while demonizing and diagnosing your family. She really does need therapy.", "NTA. I be love people who *think* they are experts because they read books about stuff.", "NTA It needed to be said, her brothers reactions verify that.

Were they together first or something?", "NTA. she sounds like she has a lot of unresolved issues from the past and is projecting that on you and other family members she has resentment for.

That\u2019s alienating for sure, to insert yourself and block her getting answers\u2026from her dad\u2026why?\n\nI hate to say it, I am leaning to y t a. \n\nShe needed it to hear it like you said yourself and everyone agreed.\n\nI think she didn\u2019t need to hear it like this. You did effectively confirm her fears to her, knowing her fear is her fathers abandonment and being replaced.\n\nLastly, while I get you feel blamed maybe. She actually didn\u2019t blame you - she\u2019s speaking about her dad. Asking for some acknowledgement and commiseration.\n\nI would\u2019ve told her too but tried to gently before this already since it seems you are very aware. Hence my question.\n\nAlso saying go to therapy to her likely feels like you\u2019re saying she\u2019s imagining this. I\u2019d acknowledge what you say here- she feels alienated since her dad moved on and that\u2019s understandable, you\u2019ve seen it right? And she can get support for that from someone who knows how to deal with it, and you all are there for her. You (rightly) do not see how hashing out the past is solving anything given everyone has tried listening for so long, and it\u2019s not helping her to date. A professional would help apply what she\u2019s learning.\n\nShe clearly wants to be part of the family, I\u2019d think maybe you can still salvage it and get her help if your family can get on the same page and handle it with compassionate care. \n\nHer dad did remarry and since then she has been the outcast from what you describe. Has anyone acknowledged where she maybe rightfully entitled to her feelings? I think she will be more receptive to get help as a solution than to blame it on her if all of you acknowledge this and only this (not go in directions she can misinterpret, just listen and affirm you hear her - not get into if you see it the same, your experience is different like you described).\n\nYou are right, you all saying she is an outcast on purpose would be untrue and she\u2019s fixing on that, she does need to be focused on her inability to see and accept she\u2019s still there at the table. With you.\n\nAnd no effort to ensure she\u2019s visible in photos or deflect her concerns cause you took how the parents place photos is not right. Why do that?

Problem is that whenever i try to raise it, SHE doesn't want to \"dredge up the past\" so eventually i gave up. So we're pleasant to each other and get along okay, but I don't have much love for her and without that very important conversation where she acknowledges what she did and apologizes, I cant move forward to have a good relationship with her.

Frankly Speaking With the way all of you acted at her Outburst makes me think that she has kind of a valid point there. Instead of anybody getting her help over the years and understanding that this is her trying to process grief and hurt and obviously going through something y'all just roll your eyes and make fun of her buying her back and then you stand up and do a pygmy moment of a victory clapping back at her where everybody stands up and applauds you and she leaves in tears. I understand I'm exaggerating this but surely you must understand what a slap in the face replacing her picture was with you when she already is having problems because her father never properly helped her through the divorce and being forced into your family? I think you're being a little pretentious here. I think your entire family honestly did her dirty and now that stuff is coming up because none of you ever did anything about this earlier you're all acting like she's some weirdo and it seems like you guys have your own special family group and she's on the outside looking in and trying to relate or work her way in and you all just sat there and laughed at her and moved her pictures to the lounge.
