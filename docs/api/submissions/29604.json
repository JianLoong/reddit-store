I (F28) am currently 7 months pregnant, expecting my first child with my husband (M32). We have been married for a year, together for 5.5 years. I\u2019ve always strived to have a great relationship with his family, he is the youngest sibling with two older sisters, let\u2019s call them Ally (F36), and Carli (F39). Ally had a baby a few years ago and we have been bonding over baby life which is great. Carli was a bit cold towards me when I first started dating my husband but has warmed up to me in the last few years. \nWhen we announced our pregnancy to his family, MIL immediately offered to help host the baby shower with Carli. I thanked them profusely. \nA few months passed, and I was about 6 months pregnant and figured it was time to start planning the shower. I invited Carli to lunch for a planning session. I told her that we were moving on a certain date and didn\u2019t want the shower before that date because I wanted to get thru the move first. She agreed, and then told me she had to get a surgery done pertaining to her fertility. She told me her husband and her had been trying and miscarrying multiple times. I offered my condolences and internally worried that the shower might be too sensitive a subject for her with her losses. But she agreed to go forward with the planning of the shower, but couldn\u2019t nail down a date due to her surgery. i totally understood. \nFast forward a few weeks, my MIL reached out to me and told me Carli could no longer host the shower, they had ordered invites and set a date (before my move) at a local steakhouse restaurant. I was very upset that they didn\u2019t communicate the change of plans with me before ordering the invites and making these plans, so I asked her to please not send those invites, I would make a plan B. \nI contacted my dad, and he & my stepmother offered to host the baby shower instead. We set a date for November. I then reached out to my MIL and Carli and thanked them for the hard work they had put in and offered my stepmoms contact info if they still wanted to be involved. My MIL skirted the text completely by saying that she needed to care for Carli during her healing period. And Carli responded with saying how she didn\u2019t think it was cool that they put money & time into the shower and how it didn\u2019t work out. She called the $80 spent on invites our gift and she wouldn\u2019t be attending. I called my husband crying and he called Carli to see what was going on. Carli said she \u201cneeded a few days to cool off\u201d and she would reach out to me and make amends. I haven\u2019t heard from her in over a month.

They ignored your one constraint, so they're off the planning committee.  It sounds like Carli is having a rough time listening and dealing with her fertility issue at the same time, so it's better that she not attend your shower.", "NTA. They ignored your wishes completely. And Carli spending $80 on invites and gift meant $15 on invites that she shouldn't have printed up and $65 on a gift she'll just return. Let your stepmom know who to invite, including your in-laws and accept they may not attend.", " NTA. She and MIL are.  Take the break in communication as a gift. Do things the way you want.  If they can make it fine, if not, fine.  It is absurd they did this.  Better set some firm boundaries with these two hens!", "I think you handled the situation beautifully and respectfully.\n\nIf they have problems, it\u2019s on them and for your husband to take care of.", "Nta, fingers crossed that her surgery goes well and the rest of your pregnancy.

Not only was it before the date OP said not to have it before, she could have something going on on that day! Dang, maybe she is taking a cross country trip that week. Sorry, you don't book something and make invites without letting the guest of honor know. They were being petty. Probably did not even order invites", "No one can get along with everyone. You had a calm discussion about your desires. You explained about having a plan B. They didn't say anything. Yes, there are circumstances with your SIL and her fertility issues, but that doesn't explain or excuse your MIL unless Carli didn't communicate your wishes. At this point, let your husband deal with his side of the family.  Concentrate on the move and your own health."]}
