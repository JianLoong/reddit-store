We haven\u2019t moved in together yet.\n\nAbby is quite smart, she has a phd and works in her field. I only have a BA so you can imagine my surprise when hot and smart woman wanted to date me. Anyway, I digress, Abby\u2019s passion is writing although she\u2019s never allowed me to read anything she wrote. She dreams of writing a book and says she\u2019s practicing and trying to draft things. \n\nOne day, I was staying over and fell asleep and she went to her office to write. When I woke up I peered over her shoulder when she was writing and saw names that sounded familiar. I asked her about this and sure enough, she admitted to writing Fanfiction. Apparently, she already wrote 100k Fanfiction and is working on her third one. She says it\u2019s writing practice and she loves it. I told her it\u2019s cringy and if she was serious about her book, she\u2019d write it by now because she\u2019s pretty much already wrote 2 books if only they weren\u2019t Fanfiction. She got silent and told me to leave her alone.\n\nWhen I introduced her to my family, I mentioned that she has a phd. My brother and sister got impressed and asked about it. Abby tried to tell them but I interjected and told them to not be so impressed because she wastes her time writing silly Fanfiction so Idont know how she even got her doctorate. It was meant to be a joke but Abby was angry. She called me an asshole She wouldn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the day and asked me to drive her home. I tried to come in but she told me she wanted to be alone and write her Fanfiction. I told her she was childish but left anyway.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard back from her since then and I told my sister and my sister agreed with Abby.\n\nI tried to call Abby but she texted me with \u201casshole,\u201d and nothing else. My sister thinks I owe Abby an apology but I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong and yet Abby is annoyed.\n\nWas I really the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1681324796, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12juqgd/aita_for_making_fun_of_my_girlfriend_for_writing/", "score": 3426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fanfiction is writing. Ever heard of 50 Shades of Gray? That series started as Twilight fanfiction. \n\nYou were rude, insulted her writing hobby, her degree, and her intelligence. \n\nYes, you really were a massive asshole and I think this is a case where you don't realize it yet, but you're already an ex.", "YTA.\n\n> you can imagine my surprise when hot and smart woman wanted to date me\n\nWe're surprised, too. But thankfully she's seen the light and broken up with you.", "YTA and this post reeks of jealousy. You try to dismiss the work she put in to earn her PhD because you don't like what she writes? Who made you the writing police?", "YTA\n\nIf she's writing, it's writing. Doesn't matter if you approve of the subject matter or not. Being a gatekeeper and judging your girlfriend's hobby so contemptuously makes you the asshole, every time.", ">she admitted to writing Fanfiction\n\nshe admitted this to you privately because she trusted you, and you made fun of her publicly for it. YTA.", "Yes, YTA. You took something your gf enjoys and humiliated her for it in front of your family. You played down her amazing accomplishments specifically to belittle her choice of relaxation? Something that has helped many writers get the practice and feedback needed to launch their own books! That's not loving behavior, it's bullying. Yet you call HER immature?", "YTA - Wow. Dumping on her harmless hobby and dissing her in front of her family. Yeah, you... you're not really a prize, are you?", "YTA - You are an AH and she is your EX girlfriend. You feel insecure about her level of education compared to hers to you decided to make fun of her and put her down in front of your family. The only one acting childish is you.", "YTA. Sounds like you are so intimidated by her intelligence that you would find anything to publicly humiliate her and make you feel better about the relationship. Yikes.\n\nWriting is writing, whether or not YOU personally love the subject or not.", "YTA. Did you really think you would get any other reaction? You mock her for doing something she enjoys, you belittled her education because it, and tried to make her look silly in front of your family. Hopefully she doesn't give you another chance. You seem to have a complex about her being better educated than you. You should build your partner up, not knock them down. Encouraging her to write a book is great, but not at the cost of making her love of fanfiction seem meaningless. You are entirely TAH here.", "YTA. This story is as true as your imaginary gf with a Phd.", "YTA. Multiple people have told you already that you are. Do you even like her? What you did was mean and insulting. She deserves better.", "YTA- obviously you have no idea about writing. .. Fanfiction is a valid way to learn the writing craft, gain followers and then write your own series. And she is not the one being childish, you sneaked in, read over her shoulder! Then you insult her..", "YTA. Of course it's real writing. You absolutely owe her an apology, and readjust your attitude if you want to stay with her.", "Yta\nAnd just FYi, you are most likely single. So stop calling her your girlfriend.  \n\n\nNext time, stop being so insecure because she is more accomplished than you.\n\n\nYou sound like a miserable person.", "I didn't read the post, but YTA because fan fiction is writing and you sound like a judgmental butthole from the post's title alone.\n\nEdit: Read the rest of your post and my snap judgment was correct. Are you legit saying that she didn't earn her degree that she worked hard on because she has a hobby that she finds fun and enjoyable that happens to be writing fan fiction?\n\nAnd then you made fun of her in front of your family. Wow. Read this part again and think about how your girlfriend felt when you did this to her:\n\n>When I introduced her to my family, I mentioned that she has a phd. My brother and sister got impressed and asked about it. Abby tried to tell them but I interjected and told them to not be so impressed because she wastes her time writing silly Fanfiction so Idont know how she even got her doctorate\n\nSeriously, demeaning your SO and her academic accomplishments is emotional abuse.", "YTA - You shouldn't even need to ask.  You sound like someone who can't play a sport making fun of someone who plays in the minor leagues because they are not Major League players.  Do you realize that the difference between you and the minor league player is way bigger than the difference between a minor league player and the major league players? \n\nSame here.  And the comment she made that she is practicing is even more of a giveaway that you are the AH.  That is exactly what is going on.", "YTA; how could you think otherwise? You insulted your partner's passion, called her childish, then berated her in front of your family. In what realm does that make you not an asshole? I hope she never responds.", "YTA.\n\nWhy are you putting her hobby down? If she likes it and it makes her happy, support her in it. How can she improve with you being a negative ass?\n\nWhat do you do that's so exciting and interesting?", "YTA and sound insufferable.  Have you any idea the value of fanfiction?  The extended Star Wars universe wouldn't even exist if it weren't for authors creating stories and diving deeper into character archs. And that's just one example.  Writing is writing regardless of the subject matter.\n\nEarning a doctorate is no easy task and for you to simultaneously insinuate to your siblings that she's not that smart because of her hobby and then SHIT on that hobby?  You're a giant dick and honestly I think maybe you feel threatened by Abby's brain so you pick on her choice of hobby so you can feel superior.\n\nI hope she dumps you and finds someone who will lift her up and support her hobbies and endeavors and view her as a human and not a \"Hot AND Smart\" trophy like you seem to be.\n\nSeriously, Who are you to decide what makes someone happy?  Sheesh - for someone with a BA you come off pretty dumb and seem to confuse cocky smugness with intelligence.", "'Hey internet, I insulted my girlfriend's passion, embarrassed her and put her down in front of my family and everyone thinks I'm an ah, so am I ?\"\n  \nyea, 10000% YTA and it's cringy that you care so much about belittling something that someone you love/care about feels passionate about.", "YTA\n\nYes, you really were the asshole here.  You found an amazing and smart woman, and decided to mock her to her face and to your family about her writing.  She told you she loves doing something and you told her that her hobby is cringy and childish.\n\nHow do you not see that you're an asshole here?  And get ready, because she's dumped you and you just don't realize it yet.", "YTA you basically called her stupid in front of your family. why are you with this woman if you're not proud of who she is and chooses to be.", "You can't be as stupid as you want us to believe.\nYTA", "YTA, a major one at that. What gives you the right to belittle her hobbies? Or judge her writing as cringy or less than other writing from it being fanfiction? Apologies to your girlfriend. You seem about as emotionally mature as a highschooler.", "YTA. Fanfiction IS writing, same way fanart is art. If she is as smart as you say she is, she should reconsider your relationship. I wouldn't be with someone who invalidated me the way you invalidated her", "YTA, and you\u2019ll be lucky if you\u2019re not back on the singles market soon. Fanfiction is real writing; it\u2019s simply fiction inspired by another writer\u2019s characters and, sometimes, plot. I\u2019ve read fanfics that have been better written than their source material. And as for your telling your family not to be impressed by Abby\u2019s Ph.D. because she writes \u201csilly Fanfiction,\u201d that\u2019s not \u201cjoke.\u201d That\u2019s 100% jerk, made worse by your calling her childish when she\u2019d clearly had enough of your idiocy for one day. Are you sure you\u2019re not simply envious because she has the discipline and talent to actually write?\n\nMy guess is that this smart, hot writer is rethinking whether you\u2019re worth it right now, given that she\u2019s not taking your call. Yeah, you\u2019re the asshole, all right. Probably a single asshole by now, too.\n\nEdit - sentence", "YTA. She found joy in writing and now you\u2019ve made her feel bad about it. And you proved she was right not to share it with you. I\u2019ve been shamed by a partner for my fic writing and I\u2019m still not over it and I was never able to look at them the same way again. Although it sounds like she probably will never look at you again, period.\n\nI have written several novels worth of fanfic. It\u2019s been read by thousands of people. No, I don\u2019t make money off it, but I enjoy writing it, it helps me make sense of my own issues, I\u2019ve made friends through it, and I\u2019ve been told by many people my work has positively influenced their lives. Other people\u2019s stories have helped me, too. Fanfic is how I\u2019ve come to process and accept my sexual orientation, understand and leave a toxic relationship, express myself and my desires with my partner better, and generally just feel happier and more confident being myself.", "YTA, and you're too old to not realize it. Looks like her instincts of not letting you read her work was spot on. Writing is writing. Just because she's working with existing frameworks doesn't mean she isn't doing creative work (which will undoubtedly lead to her own original characters and stories).", "YTA. You embarrassed her in front of your family and put her down. You're making her feel bad for something she likes to do that isn't hurting anyone and is a creative outlet/practice for her.", "YTA. Cassandra Clare got started writing fan fiction and now she's a well published author with TV adaptations of her books.", "You are so much the AH. I am offended for her. We all start life in the womb as an AH, but judging from this, it sounds like you didn't develop beyond that before you were shitted out. It's a shame, she sounds like a wonderful human being, and according to you, a great GF. You couldn't see beyond your own shallow views, you judged her for doing something that made her happy, and you felt that YOU, of all people, were in a position to pass judgement on her. Even with all that, you still felt the need to come here and ask if you were the AH. I don't know if you enjoy being ridiculed or if you truly can't see the AH-ishness of your actions, but you sir, are a grade A ASSHOLE.", "YTA\n\nFanfiction IS writing. She's putting words to paper isn't she? And how does her hobby have any impact at all on her intelligence or PhD? The university isn't going to rescind it because she has a hobby you don't approve of.\n\nAnd even if you had a right to comment on said hobby, you are so shitty and petty for bringing it up while introducing her to your family.", "Yes, YTA. (1) Fanfic can be great writing practice that will lead to writing an original novel; (2) fanfic can be great writing practice that could lead to a job as a TV writer; (3) fanfic can be a great hobby that makes her happy and fulfilled, like woodworking or painting for other people. Your \"joke\" was nasty and hostile, and contained zero humor and 100% attack on her intelligence. Basically, there is no reason why she should want to ever talk to you again. Mazel tov.", "YTA - and single", "Yta. You are mocking your (for now) girlfriend. How can you possibly think that is okay?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with fanfiction.

As long as she enjoys what she is doing - good for her.", "You are a total asshole.  \nLet me repeat, You Are A Total Asshole.   \n\n\nI don't even know how you even have to ask. What is wrong with you? What, in your head, is justification for being cruel and mean to your girlfriend? What a judgmental asshole you are. \n\nAsshole. Asshole. Asshole. Oh, and she's not annoyed. She's furious and hurt and likely humiliated and making a voodoo doll of you as we speak.

I hope she leaves you and makes her fortune writing", "You are absolutely the asshole. Not only are you mocking her simple pleasures, you belittle her in front of others. She deserves so much better and I hope she finds happiness with a better partner someday.", "MAAAAAAAJOR YTA. Like, Nuclear, you\u2019re condescending and reductive.

If you actually cared for her you wouldn't make fun of something she loves and enjoys doing.", "Youre absolutely the asshole", "YTA And, call it a hunch, but I think you're going to be single very soon.", "YTA majorly.

You admit that this girl is out of your league.  \n\n\nShe enjoys this specific kind of writing, and your plan is to insult her hobby to her face, and then once again in public even after she was clearly sad after the first time?    \n\n\nIs this some sort of insecurity thing?  I really don't get how you can be this dense.  Maybe she really IS that much smarter than you.  She said she likes doing it what's the problem.

In the future, wonderful advice for holding down a successful relationship starts with not publicly humiliating the people you want to date. \n\nAlso as someone who makes a living writing many people start their careers with fanfic.

We haven\u2019t moved in together yet.\n\nAbby is quite smart, she has a phd and works in her field. I only have a BA so you can imagine my surprise when hot and smart woman wanted to date me. Anyway, I digress, Abby\u2019s passion is writing although she\u2019s never allowed me to read anything she wrote. She dreams of writing a book and says she\u2019s practicing and trying to draft things. \n\nOne day, I was staying over and fell asleep and she went to her office to write. When I woke up I peered over her shoulder when she was writing and saw names that sounded familiar. I asked her about this and sure enough, she admitted to writing Fanfiction. Apparently, she already wrote 100k Fanfiction and is working on her third one. She says it\u2019s writing practice and she loves it. I told her it\u2019s cringy and if she was serious about her book, she\u2019d write it by now because she\u2019s pretty much already wrote 2 books if only they weren\u2019t Fanfiction. She got silent and told me to leave her alone.\n\nWhen I introduced her to my family, I mentioned that she has a phd. My brother and sister got impressed and asked about it. Abby tried to tell them but I interjected and told them to not be so impressed because she wastes her time writing silly Fanfiction so Idont know how she even got her doctorate. It was meant to be a joke but Abby was angry. She called me an asshole She wouldn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the day and asked me to drive her home. I tried to come in but she told me she wanted to be alone and write her Fanfiction. I told her she was childish but left anyway.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard back from her since then and I told my sister and my sister agreed with Abby.\n\nI tried to call Abby but she texted me with \u201casshole,\u201d and nothing else. My sister thinks I owe Abby an apology but I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong and yet Abby is annoyed.\n\nWas I really the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But yeah Persephone and Hades is constantly revamped and Hadestown is a huge fanfiction musical that's gotten massive success.\n\nMost King Arthur stories are fanfiction, Robin Hood is mostly fanfiction, just...people suck about hobbies.

Well, hopefully she cuts him out!", "This might be a hot take, but as someone who writes both Fanfic and OG content - Fanfic is almost harder to write than OG stuff. With original works, you get to make the rules, where as when you write fanfiction, you're stuck following the rules that someone else made. If someone is out of character or if you write something that contradicts the established canon, people can and will call you out on it, and they're not always nice about it.", "The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood (huge bestseller) started as a Kylo Ren fanfiction \ud83e\udd23", "People insulting hobbies makes me so angry. \n\nIf she danced, but OP found out she danced contemporary and not ballet, would he say that that\u2019s not real dancing? Of course not. Because it is real dancing!!! Is she writing? Yes. That\u2019s all that matters. She likely says she\u2019s \u201cpracticing\u201d for her novel specifically because of people like OP who dismiss fan fiction as \u201cnot real writing\u201d and it\u2019s been ingrained in her that it\u2019s not legitimate writing unless she\u2019s working towards something more \u201cmeaningful\u201d or whatever bullshit reason people give to say fanfics aren\u2019t real writing.", "So many people are falling for it, and itbis beautiful to watch.", "Looks like he no longer has a partner with a PhD.", "Wait... at this point his relationship is fan fiction.", "Well, at least he got one thing right.\n\nHe ISN'T worthy of a beautiful, intelligent woman.", "EXACTLY what I was thinking!

And your (possibly former) GF is absolutely correct. It\u2019s great practice and a way to both develop her writing style AND get positive feedback (something you are obviously incapable of giving). \n\nOP, you are without a doubt 1000% the a-hole here.

No one needs people like that in their life - people who only want to discourage, criticize, and belittle your accomplishments rather than being supportive. Who tf cares if writing fanfic doesn't make you a \"rEaL aUtHoR\" in the eyes of people like this?? Anyone with half a heart and half a brain can see that ultimately, you're writing fiction to a relatively large audience that enjoys reading it. Which is an awesome thing for both you as a writer, and the audience who gets to read about their (generally fairly niche) interests. Shame on people like OP who try to shame that and act like if you're not some sorta massive mainstream published author then you're just writing \"silly\" pointless stories that somehow don't count as actual stories. It's just absurd.", "Imitating someone else's work was basic practice in Roman education. Students would imitate a famous speech for just those reasons: to get a feel for dialog, pacing, etc. The advanced practice was to rework the famous piece in a creative way to make it your own.

And my aunt was stunned but very puzzled why people were writing things of such quality despite knowing that they could never earn any money from them. I had to explain that that's kind-of the point, to write something for your own pleasure in writing and your audience's pleasure in reading.

They dropped the ball HEAVILY on that part. a lot of it is wrong in the community hence why it got so much backlash. because no one did proper edits on those parts. Writing out a Dom/Sub relationship and all that it entails...its difficult. because its...not entirely black and white, nor is it \"master x slave\" because thats a WHOLE different part of BDSM its a spectrum so they did drop the ball. \n\nI loved the movies my partner hated Gray though because his acting/voice put him to sleep XD   \n\n\nAnd thanks! I'm gonna try to get into A03 to kinda push myself into writing more because nanowrino helps but its not as \"pushy\" as being on A03 would be. I'm gonna have it tagged as \"marvel\" but explain to people that \"James\" was based on Bucky to a point so was Angel. I mean her code name is the Angel of Winter! or Winter Angel in English (she's part Romanian so I prefer the Romanian translation because it flows better) but she morphed into her own character, James is his own character he may or may not have a metal arm but thats just fanservice for me now. Theirs no really \"steve\" coming to save his ass either. \n\nBut fanfics can do so much for a writer. it starts as fanfic then we do get books like shadowhunters, hunger games, Divergent , 50 shades etc because it turns into its own story where things are def not the same as the original. And yea it may not turn into a multi-million best seller but some money is money to me. And being able to say \"i published something good \" is nice lol. I mean i've published a smut book but it needs a total revamp and dialogue added.....yeaaa I can say i published but i dont lol", "I remember reading about it all on Live Journal!
