The person you recommend for a job is a direct reflection on you. If your cousin does not have a good track record with employers it could hurt your chances for success.", "NTA - having your company hire someone you know may not be a good employee would not look good. You did the right thing. You already helped him out once and look what happened.", "NTA.  He is completely unreliable.  When he inevitably screws up at work, it will reflect on you.  Don't recommend him, and don't feel bad.", "NTA - he\u2019s only coming to you because he needs something. He\u2019s also proven he isn\u2019t reliable so that isn\u2019t someone I\u2019d want to recommend for a job, I\u2019d do what he did and just avoid him like the plague", "NTA, I mean, you gave this guy 12,500 and make no mistake, you definitely gave it to him, and it honestly sounds like you don't expect it back at this point, so just stick to no.", "NTA.
