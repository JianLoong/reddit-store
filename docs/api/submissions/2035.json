About a year after the divorce, he passed away. My ex was paying child support but that stopped the day he died. The girls inherited their father\u2019s estate but since he was fresh into his career, it wasn\u2019t much. Things could have been rough as a single mother but his brothers stepped into his shoes.\n\nThey took the girls on the weekends and basically bought the girls anything they needed from clothing to school supplies and bought our groceries. They also indulged the girls\u2019 every whim. Stacy loved horses when she was little so uncle John paid for her lessons and riding fees. Emily thought she wanted to play the piano so uncle Jeff paid for her lessons and bought her a piano. When the girls grew out of those phases and got interested in something else, their uncles were there ready to indulged them. I tried talking to the uncles about not spoiling my girls but they said that their nieces needed to explore their own interests and those explorations will help their brain developments. I disagree but was not in a financial situation to push too hard because they were paying so much for the girls, I was basically responsible for only the rent.\n\nI later remarried a wonderful man who brought 2 kids into the family. We had 1 more kid together and things are good for the most part. However kids are smart so my daughters\u2019 step and half siblings started to notice their sisters having more experiences and things than they do. My husband didn\u2019t like the situation and we had some arguments about it over the years. Things came to a boiling point recently when we were discussing how to pay for our two oldest kids\u2019 colleges (Stacy and her step brother Rick 18m). Both are good students and while they haven\u2019t gotten their acceptance letters, I have no doubt they\u2019ll get into good schools.\n\nMy husband and I make enough money to live a middle class lifestyle with 5 kids but not enough to put them through college. The reality is that they\u2019ll have to take out school loans. We talked to both of them about loans and this is when I found out Stacy had already talked to her uncles and they\u2019re paying for her tuition and cost of living wherever she wants to go. This floored us and made my husband extremely mad. He got red and started to scream how it\u2019s not fair Stacy and Emily will get to go to expensive colleges and graduate with no loans while our other kids will have to go to state schools and take out loans. He wanted me to call John and Jeff to tell them to stop spoiling the girls. On one hand I agree 100% with my husband that it\u2019s not fair to my other kids but on the other hand I can\u2019t hold my daughters back from something so wonderful.\n\nIn the end, I told my husband I\u2019m not going to tell my ex-BILs to stop spoiling our daughters. Was I wrong to tell him that?\n\nUpdate - thank you all for reading my post and answering my question. Things have gone downhill and I\u2019m now crushed.\n\nI was at work and without my knowledge, my husband called John and yelled at him to mind his own business, told him we don\u2019t want their money, and to stay out of our lives. My husband then went and yelled at the girls as they packed their bags and as they were leaving for their uncle\u2019s. When I got home, my husband wanted to call the police to report them as runaways but I talked him out of it. I went over to John\u2019s house and his wife led me to the kitchen where we stood in silence watching John holding my girls while they cried. For a minute, I pictured their father holding them. Stacy and Emily refused to talk to me when they walked pass me on their way upstairs to their room. John and I had a long conversation about the whole situation. He basically told me he\u2019s doing what his brother couldn\u2019t and both me and my husband can go to hell if we don\u2019t like it. He said the girls should stay with him and his family until things calm down and I agreed. So this is where we are for now.\n\nAlso to answer some common questions:\n\n1. My husband makes less money than I do so he\u2019s been unable to save up college tuition.\n2. His ex is still in the picture and have visitation rights. She makes less money than him so have nothing saved up much less tuition.", "created_utc": 1668170137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys97jv/aita_telling_my_husband_im_not_going_to_tell_my/", "score": 2221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wants his children to live a certain lifestyle, it\u2019s his responsibility to provide that lifestyle.  Sounds like he shouldn\u2019t have had that 3rd child with you if he wasn\u2019t even financially capable of providing the 2 children he already had with the material goods and experiences he thinks they deserve.\n\nBottom line - he has no right to complain or even comment on what Stacy & Emily\u2019s uncles do for them.  It is absolutely NONE of his business.  If anything, he should be grateful!  I\u2019m sure their financial assistance has taken a great deal of financial responsibility off of yourself and HIS children have only benefitted from that!\n\nTell your husband to grow up and start taking responsibility for his own decisions and failings as a father.  Tell him to stop whining about what other people\u2019s children have and do something to provide his own children with the things he thinks they deserve.  Get a second job.  Get a higher paying job.  Start making sacrifices by spending less on whatever he spends on his own hobbies etc.", "NTA. Your husband and you both need to cut this shit about your daughters being spoiled though. Its not spoiling kids to help them explore their interests or to pay for them to launch their lives debt free. Just because many won't have those advantages does not mean your ex's brothers are wrong for offering it to your girls. They don't need to suffer and struggle or be unfulfilled until everyone else has equal access to those advantages.

If not for their paying for this, who would pay for it? You or you and your husband would probably end up funding a large amount of it. The uncles paying for their education frees up the money you & husband would have spent on education for Stacy & Lucy to spend on the other kids\u2019 education or whatever else you want. The correct response is, \u201cThank you for your generosity\u201d. \nEdit: I read the update.

There is literally no upside and would be totally out of spite.

It's not fair your kids grew up without a dad. It's not fair their dad will will every milestone they have.  Not fair at all.", "NTA no you are not wrong and your husband is an AH that he thinks it's OK to take away from your daughters' family just because it gives them something his kids don't get. It's selfish, self-absorbed, and a sign of his own insecurities about money.", "NTA. Also a: now you don\u2019t have to worry about the two girls, just paying for the other kids. That is a win for you, right? B: how he does plan to STOP your girls uncles (because you refer to them as ex-BIL a lot, but there is nothing ex about their relation to the girls) spoiling them? Stacy is old enough she doesn\u2019t really need either of your permission to do anything. Your youngest might be cut off from them for awhile, but how are you going to stop them from paying for college for her once she goes? All that will accomplish is making her dislike you and probably jump ship to stay with her uncle the minute she is old enough.", "NTA.  Even if you were on your husband\u2019s side, I\u2019m not sure how either of you think you\u2019re supposed to interfere with an arrangement your soon-to-be 18 year old has worked out independently with her uncles, or stop Emily from doing the same when she comes of age.  This is clearly happening whether you like it or not, so your husband needs to accept that and come up with ways to support the other kids using available resources and scholarship research instead of resenting your older girls\u2019 good fortune.", "NTA. Your husband is. Assume that it\u2019s not your girls uncles but their father doing this, how would it be different? It wouldn\u2019t. Your girls have some awesome family and I am so glad they didn\u2019t miss out on life because they lost their dad. Your step children also have another parent, what if she were providing extravagance for your step children? How would that be different?

I wanna give that guy an award.\n\nYour current husband now only needs to pay for his own children, that saved him a lot of money.

You can\u2019t deprive your daughters just to be \u201cequal\u201d and it\u2019s rich that he\u2019s so worried about that when it\u2019s his kids but seems to have no problem with subjecting your daughters to massive debt she doesn\u2019t have to have.", "NTA - but I do agree it's a tricky situation to navigate as it's hard to see your other kids envious of their siblings advantages in life. I think that's incredible of their uncles to be so involved and I would never want to rob them of that relationship either, even if it means they might be getting more out of this arrangement than the other kids. \n\nAnd hey, one day they might be the aunts and uncles helping their siblings out or spoiling their nieces/nephews.", "NTA.  Wow, talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth!  Every time your BILs \"spoil\" two of your children, that frees up resources you would have used on them for your other children.  They're doing your whole family a huge favor - 2 out of 5 kids get basically a free ride to college!  That's huge!  I'd be grateful beyond belief, and would look at that as an opportunity to help out the other 3 kids more than I thought I could when I thought I had to help out 5 kids.  This is crazy ego-driven logic your husband is employing and it's bad for your whole family.  Sit him down and do some math - if he doesn't see what a gift your family is receiving and can't find at least enough gratitude to just stay out of the way, then I don't know what to say.", "NTA for not telling the Uncles to stop caring for your daughters. BUT your husband is DEFINITELY one, and if you allow him to treat your daughters and their uncles- who have literally been angels- then you WILL be. The financial situation with your husband and his ex is a THEM problem. It is absolutely NOT your daughters or their Uncle's problem. Their relationship with their Uncles is 100% not your husbands business.", "You need to get a backbone. Is John single?\n\nNTA", "NTA but also YTA for allowing your husband to yell at your daughters if he hadn\u2019t married you how would his kids have an education? And  it\u2019s none of his business if a family member stepped up for another family member(s)", "Your husband is a diiiiiiick!!! And you will 100% be the AH if you attempt to stop your daughters family from supporting them.", "NTA. \n\nPeople need to realize they are not entitled to anything just because someone else has it. Siblings included.", "NTA your husband is being greedy. The girls' family are taking care of them financially in place of their lost father. That's a beautiful thing. Your husband should be more appreciative.", "Your kids are very blessed, they have uncles who are helping them out financially, and I\u2019m assuming their spouses are ok and on board with them doing this. \nIt\u2019s a rare find these days where people are so generous. Usually a spouse or their own kids take priority. In hope you and your kids know how lucky they are. Their uncles really stepped up after their Dad passed away. They could have done just the minimum, if that. They had no obligation. And you\u2019re blessed their spouses are ok with it.", "NTA With blended families, fair is what occurs in the household. What the outside family of either chooses to give their child relatives is out of bounds for the steps to make a fuss about. Why? because extended family is a reality and them showing their love through generosity is one way that they do it. To throw that in their faces is essentially telling them that their relationship to the child(ren) doesn't count when it counts for a hell of a lot. This should have been explained to the steps when you blended. 'While we will treat all of you the same in this house, Stacey and Emily have extended family through their deceased father who love them very much and have been very generous with them as their uncles and as a stand-in for their late father.' Your husband is shitting on your daughters' connection to their late father through their uncles and the uncles themselves. Because he and his kids are jealous. Well, I'm sure that your girls would rather have their dad back. The next best thing is a great relationship with their uncles.", "NTA \n\nwhilst i see where your husband is coming from, it\u2019s coming from a place of jealousy instead of thinking what\u2019s best for the girls. yes it sad that not all your kids will be afforded the opportunities it\u2019s just sometimes the way it goes", "In fo: is your husband a crab in a bucket? \n\nHis mentality of everyone should suffer just because I do (or in this case his other kids do) is incredibly toxic. If anything the fact that your two daughters have amazing uncles who are willing to spend money on them and their interests  and education is a blessing. This way the two of you can spend/save a little more for the other kids. If you haven't been accounting for that in your budgets you guys are both assholes.", "Additionally, if their dad hadn\u2019t passed, they would have still had a dad would have contributed to their college expenses and not to their step/half-siblings. That\u2019s still something OP and her husband would have had to explain to their kids. It just likely would have been accompanied by them spending time with their dad and his side of the family. But the kids would have noticed their siblings came home from dad\u2019s Christmas with a bag of new gifts and stuff.\n\nFrankly the best time to explain this would have been when they were young. Just say that their step siblings have a different dad and his family. Which may or may not mean that sometimes they get things from their grandparents or uncles that step siblings might not. And that\u2019s just the way things are sometimes, just like their friends might get more or less than them for Christmas or get to try out expensive after school hobbies that they can\u2019t afford, etc.", "I think it\u2019s actually esh. Op keeps calling her daughters \u201cspoiled\u201d. But I fail to see how paying for extracurriculars makes a child spoiled. Or paying for their college.", "Your last paragraph is straight delusion. It isn't spoiling children by taking care of them and supporting their needs.", ">Having your girls' uncles assume  the financial burden for their living expenses will free you up to help the other kids, where you can.\n\nI thought of this immediately. How is OP missing this?", "Not to mention, it probably makes the uncles feel like they are keeping the brother close by doing things for his children.", "And don't forget, his kids still have another parent that has an obligation to contribute. Any college funds that he and OP have saved should go further with his two, since his ex should be contributing as well. Her two would have been in the same situation, if their father was still alive. An ex is never obligated to contribute towards children that aren't theirs, so the remaining 3 would never have seen a penny of his money, nor should they.", "Henceforth the reason they packed their bags and went to the Uncles.", "I get it. He sees his stepchildren getting all this extra stuff from their rich uncles and his kids are jealous. It's a rough spot to be in for sure, to not be able to provide the same things to your children that their step-siblings get due to outside forces.\n\nBut it's not OP's fault, nor should the uncles be forced to care for the children of their ex-SIL's new husband. And as others have pointed out correctly, since the uncles are absorbing a huge financial burden that means they can distribute more of their own resources to his and their children - they essentially only have to pay for three kids because his brothers have stepped into late ex-husband's financial role.", "> keep in mind that OP calls it spoiling.\n\nOffering a niece a piano or riding lessons (you're not giving yourself) as just the first example do sound like that.\n\nBut it's not out of place for uncles who are apparently wealthy (or at least have more than enough), lost who I assume was their kid brother (\"fresh into his career\") and basically decided to make good lives for their nieces.", "This. All day.", "I thought of that. Wonder why OP didn't mention her.", "And cover up the fact that he's embarrassed that he makes less money than his wife and the girls uncles.", "But did she though?", "With his attitude, I would doubt they have the greatest coparenting relationship.", "She did. Apparently the ex-wife makes even less than the current husband and neither have savings- much less college funds.", "I actually wonder if late ex-husband had several brothers, or if he had a brother who married another man. A gay couple financially adopting their brother/BIL's children after his death is a tale as old as time.", "You have NO idea how much I wish my parents had fostered a mentality of \u201cTRY THE THING!!!!\u201c in me. I have a really, really hard time as an adult getting involved in things that interest me because of my crippling fear of failure and my general feelings of malaise about starting and subsequently dropping things if I\u2019m not into them. It results in me only doing things I *know* I could succeed in, which is extremely limiting and honestly not a great way to live life. It\u2019s stuff I\u2019m working through, but man if that mentality had been given to me earlier\u2026 you\u2019re a really good mom. You are doing right by your daughter, fostering self-confidence and an inquisitive mind will only serve her well later in life.", "I really, really hope you've told your daughters that you are upset at how your husband has treated them and that it's not okay for him to have done that to them. If you don't directly say that you don't like what he's done, they will assume your silence is condonement and it will permanently damage your relationships with them.", "OP, can you not lie? \u201c I later remarried a wonderful man\u201d This has been proven to be false. Is it unfair his kids cant afford to go to college? Yes,  college should not cost kids to go into such great debt. However, he should not be so passionately hateful towards his step daughters getting their tuition covered by their uncles. Why do so many people have this \u201cMy situation sucks so everyone else\u2019s situation sucks\u201d. NTA.

It's not fair that your daughters from your first marriage get extra stuff from their uncle's? Is he freaking serious? Their dad DIED FFS. What about that is fair to two small children? \n\nYou need to either get your husband to counseling to deal with whatever this is or you need to kick him out. Otherwise there's a very good chance your daughters will never see you once they graduate. Seriously, the way they feel right now and how you handle this will likely decide whether they visit you and their uncle's going forward, or if they come home from college to their uncle's house(s).", "NTA Read the edit, what your husband did was absolutely unacceptable. You need to make it clear to your daughters that he went behind your back to do that and you are furious with him. That you had already told him that he was not to talk to their uncle about this. Yes, I get that he feels bad his own kids won't have the same opportunities, but how is that your fault? If the money was all from your late husband's estate his children would not be entitled to it, even your shared child would not be. Likewise if he and has ex had saved all their kids lives and had enough to put their kids through college, your daughters would not magically be entitled to that money", "Would he make a child give up a scholarship because it wasn't fair to the other kids? NTA People from different families have different amounts of resources and help. Your older kids have partly different family to the rest of the kids, it's just how it is.", "NTA- you need to tell your husband that he has no right to dictate how your daughter's paternal family take care of them. His jealousy is gross and unbecoming of someone who calls themselves and adult. His calling their uncles and trying to take their future away from them is abusive. If I were your girls I wouldn't ever want to talk to him again, nor would I talk to you if you stayed with him.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad their uncle is willing to take in your daughters, clearly their home life is toxic. However, you\u2019re a major AH for staying married to a man who thinks your daughters should suffer just because you guys can\u2019t afford to give the rest of the kids the same advantages.", "NTA but after seeing the update, if you let your husband get away with this then massive YTA", "BuT hE iS wOnDeRfUL", "Right?  They should\u2019ve lived with the uncles their whole lives.", "Honestly, I feel like the damage is already done.

Her current husband is a lazy ass. We are in a job market that is saturated with people needing work. He needs to make some sacrifices for his kids and stop pulling down her kids for getting better opportunities. Taking a second job you could have the money for 2 college tuitions to Bachlors within 4 years. Is it going to be any college they want? No but it will be paid for. And the youngest they have together there is plenty of time to work together on. My son is 5. I work for the military and do 3 side hustles, I had his college paid off to masters within those first 5 years of his life. I\u2019m not the smartest tool in the shed.
