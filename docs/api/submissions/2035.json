About a year after the divorce, he passed away. My ex was paying child support but that stopped the day he died. The girls inherited their father\u2019s estate but since he was fresh into his career, it wasn\u2019t much. Things could have been rough as a single mother but his brothers stepped into his shoes.\n\nThey took the girls on the weekends and basically bought the girls anything they needed from clothing to school supplies and bought our groceries. They also indulged the girls\u2019 every whim. Stacy loved horses when she was little so uncle John paid for her lessons and riding fees. Emily thought she wanted to play the piano so uncle Jeff paid for her lessons and bought her a piano. When the girls grew out of those phases and got interested in something else, their uncles were there ready to indulged them. I tried talking to the uncles about not spoiling my girls but they said that their nieces needed to explore their own interests and those explorations will help their brain developments. I disagree but was not in a financial situation to push too hard because they were paying so much for the girls, I was basically responsible for only the rent.\n\nI later remarried a wonderful man who brought 2 kids into the family. We had 1 more kid together and things are good for the most part. However kids are smart so my daughters\u2019 step and half siblings started to notice their sisters having more experiences and things than they do. My husband didn\u2019t like the situation and we had some arguments about it over the years. Things came to a boiling point recently when we were discussing how to pay for our two oldest kids\u2019 colleges (Stacy and her step brother Rick 18m). Both are good students and while they haven\u2019t gotten their acceptance letters, I have no doubt they\u2019ll get into good schools.\n\nMy husband and I make enough money to live a middle class lifestyle with 5 kids but not enough to put them through college. The reality is that they\u2019ll have to take out school loans. We talked to both of them about loans and this is when I found out Stacy had already talked to her uncles and they\u2019re paying for her tuition and cost of living wherever she wants to go. This floored us and made my husband extremely mad. He got red and started to scream how it\u2019s not fair Stacy and Emily will get to go to expensive colleges and graduate with no loans while our other kids will have to go to state schools and take out loans. He wanted me to call John and Jeff to tell them to stop spoiling the girls. On one hand I agree 100% with my husband that it\u2019s not fair to my other kids but on the other hand I can\u2019t hold my daughters back from something so wonderful.\n\nIn the end, I told my husband I\u2019m not going to tell my ex-BILs to stop spoiling our daughters.

If he wants his children to live a certain lifestyle, it\u2019s his responsibility to provide that lifestyle.  Sounds like he shouldn\u2019t have had that 3rd child with you if he wasn\u2019t even financially capable of providing the 2 children he already had with the material goods and experiences he thinks they deserve.\n\nBottom line - he has no right to complain or even comment on what Stacy & Emily\u2019s uncles do for them.  It is absolutely NONE of his business.  If anything, he should be grateful!  I\u2019m sure their financial assistance has taken a great deal of financial responsibility off of yourself and HIS children have only benefitted from that!\n\nTell your husband to grow up and start taking responsibility for his own decisions and failings as a father.  Tell him to stop whining about what other people\u2019s children have and do something to provide his own children with the things he thinks they deserve.  Get a second job.  Get a higher paying job.  Start making sacrifices by spending less on whatever he spends on his own hobbies etc.", "NTA. Your husband and you both need to cut this shit about your daughters being spoiled though. Its not spoiling kids to help them explore their interests or to pay for them to launch their lives debt free. Just because many won't have those advantages does not mean your ex's brothers are wrong for offering it to your girls. They don't need to suffer and struggle or be unfulfilled until everyone else has equal access to those advantages.

If not for their paying for this, who would pay for it? You or you and your husband would probably end up funding a large amount of it. The uncles paying for their education frees up the money you & husband would have spent on education for Stacy & Lucy to spend on the other kids\u2019 education or whatever else you want.

Also, who does it benefit if you ask your BIL not to pay? Your other children still have to take out loans, and now your daughter will struggle too. There is literally no upside and would be totally out of spite.

Not fair at all.", "NTA no you are not wrong and your husband is an AH that he thinks it's OK to take away from your daughters' family just because it gives them something his kids don't get. It's selfish, self-absorbed, and a sign of his own insecurities about money.", "NTA. Also a: now you don\u2019t have to worry about the two girls, just paying for the other kids. That is a win for you, right? B: how he does plan to STOP your girls uncles (because you refer to them as ex-BIL a lot, but there is nothing ex about their relation to the girls) spoiling them? Stacy is old enough she doesn\u2019t really need either of your permission to do anything. Your youngest might be cut off from them for awhile, but how are you going to stop them from paying for college for her once she goes? All that will accomplish is making her dislike you and probably jump ship to stay with her uncle the minute she is old enough.", "NTA.  Even if you were on your husband\u2019s side, I\u2019m not sure how either of you think you\u2019re supposed to interfere with an arrangement your soon-to-be 18 year old has worked out independently with her uncles, or stop Emily from doing the same when she comes of age.  This is clearly happening whether you like it or not, so your husband needs to accept that and come up with ways to support the other kids using available resources and scholarship research instead of resenting your older girls\u2019 good fortune.", "NTA. Your husband is. Assume that it\u2019s not your girls uncles but their father doing this, how would it be different? It wouldn\u2019t. Your girls have some awesome family and I am so glad they didn\u2019t miss out on life because they lost their dad. Your step children also have another parent, what if she were providing extravagance for your step children? How would that be different? Or is your husband jealous that your children don\u2019t have a dad but they have a whole family who love them and take care of them as if he were here and not abandoning them since he ain\u2019t. \n\nAt the end of the day isn\u2019t this a blessing for your step children, since your children are taken care of you are able to possibly help their father a little more with his children\u2019s tuition. \n\nIt seems to me that your husband thought he\u2019d be getting a wife with no strings since your ex isn\u2019t here anymore - he didn\u2019t bargain for the extended family to be a good one. \n\nWhere\u2019s his ex and her contribution to any of this?", "NTA, however, you\u2019re wrong about the \u201cfairness\u201d of the girls getting \u201cspoiled\u201d by their uncles.

So, instead of wailing and lamenting about 2 kids being able to avoid all college debt, be thankful.", "NTA. The other kids aren't related to you him. He's making sure to help support his brothers children in his brothers absence. Truly, what a man. I wanna give that guy an award.\n\nYour current husband now only needs to pay for his own children, that saved him a lot of money. Your ex BIL is not related to your husbands kids and as long as he's not doing it to directly spite them then let the man treat his nieces the way he thinks his brother would have wanted them to be.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, with your ex passing. But this is the situation. He couldn't complain if their dad was alive and was doing this for them. One of his relatives stepped up to the financial responsibilities and their education/experiences. Your husband needs to except that your girls shouldn't be punished for the loss of their father.", "NTA\n\nAnd tell your husband that his children get something far more valuable in their life. They have their dad! Your daugthers lost their father and its amazing that his brothers stepped up. Your daughters will resent you if you talk to your ex Bils.  Talk to your husband instead and set up clear boundaries.", "NTA. Keep in mind your husband loves his kids more than yours, and their uncles make up for that as their father is dead. He wants you to prevent something irreplaceable that your former BILs - mature adults - want to do to help their late brothers\u2019 kids - who will also be adults at the time they pay the tuition.

As in, their older sisters have other family as well. Your idiot husband has no right to try to ruin anything good that they have. If nothing else, it will lower your overall costs for so many children. I\u2019d take a careful look - is he holding this against and being unkind to them?", "NTA. Your husband needs to understand that your daughters have a whole seperate family and while it may seem unfair to the other kids it would be absolutely unequivocal unfair and down right spiteful to stop your kids from enjoying the perks of their family.

Its not your daughters fault that your husband did not save for his kids college fund.

You literally cannot do this!  Your eldest will shortly be 18 and you will have absolutely no say in what she accepts or who gives her money.  Try calling some college and telling not to accept uncle\u2019s money, lol.", "NTA\n\nLet me share a personal tid-bit:\n\nMy parents held me back from experiences because it wouldn\u2019t be fair to my step-brothers. I was more advanced, intellectually and athletically. While the step-brothers struggled with pretty much everything. \n\nIt\u2019s not a great experience to have your wings clipped by your parents because they are worried about favoritism. Your kids aren\u2019t equals in all things, and life isn\u2019t fair. My step-brothers won\u2019t talk to them and my parents are hoping I care for them in their old age should they need it because I\u2019m much more successful despite their best efforts. Fact is parents like that only care about their own egos and selves. Fairness goes out the window when it no longer benefits their well-being. \n\nYour daughters aren\u2019t being \u201cspoiled\u201d. Spoiled is about being ungrateful, not about having access.

Kinda weird that the narrative is the girls are spoilt from You and the stepdad, despite You knowing exactly why they're \"spoilt.\" Did he start calling them spoilt first and you went long with it? Seems like you have a lot of questions to ask yourself over how it got to this point? Because if you nipped it sooner, would it have got to this point?\n\n As it genuinely comes off that you've kind of thought of them both as spoilt for so long it's become the dominant narrative.", "NTA. Seems your husband has conveniently forgotten what your daughters lost to make this happen. No college fund is going to bring their father back. No amount of piano lessons will walk them down the aisle at their wedding. These girls lost one of their parents, and while I'm glad they have a support system it's not the same and never will be. Your husband is being very insensitive.", "INFO: Where is your stepkids bio Mum? It's the parents responsibility to create a trust fund for their kids. As a Step-parent who's only recently learned the father didn't set aside any money, his lack of preparation isn't your responsibility.

The uncles are only doing what their brother would have been doing, if he were still alive.\n\nOP and her husband should be grateful that they're stepping up.\n\nThough, if OPs ex were still alive and planning to pay for his girls' college, I would not be surprised if her current husband was still mad at it. Because I've seen multiple posts here on just that theme.", "> Finally, is it normal for your husband to \"get red and scream\"\n\nYes. And there\u2019s that too. That is not wonderful spouse/parent behaviour. Where else do his temper, jealousy and sense of entitlement show up in your lives?", "It's just another day on Reddit, a parent allows a new spouse destroy their relationship with their children. Lather, rinse, repeat", "What OP is overlooking is she CAN'T sabotage them. Let's say they start college at 17...ok OP could prevent early stuff being paid, but once they are 18 there isn't any way she can stop them. \n\nHusband is jealous. Oh and if you can't afford 5 kids don't have them. They each had 2 -they cod have stopped there.", "Any post that starts out with any type of praise, wonderful, most caring, etc., they are usually the total opposite. It's crazy.", "My guess is if the girls go NC/LC once they are out of the house. From OP it sounds like the girls have had to suffer living with this asshole for years and are probably looking forward to getting away from someone that does nothing but trash talk their Uncles that have always been there for them.", "Plus the girls are the uncles 'link' to their dead sibling. They are all they have left of him.", "Yeah, but you know that the dad is not going to handle this gracefully, he's going to be bitter and encourage them to be bitter too. Hopefully the kids will do better than that.", ">The girls are not being spoiled they are being given life experiences.\n\nIKR! And the uncles sound like amazing men.", "Even at 17, mom\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t get a vote in Stacy\u2019s college choices.", "Oh absolutely. It still wouldn't be fair that he didn't save/plan for his kids future and either dad has to pay or not pay to make it fair!\n\nTbh, I don't believe they've never asked for the other kids, given that Stacy didn't mention this till it was brought up. She may have thought that her uncles had discussed it with her mum, but get the feeling she's knew for a while and didn't say anything due to previous expectations/requests.", "Right, came to say this. There's nothing that CAN be done to stop the Uncles or daughter from this course. That makes the husband even more of an jerk simply because he wants to control something that is frankly none of his business at all. Not just control it, but control to the detriment of his step-daughter. NTA in any world.", "Lol... didn't see your comment, but pointed out same thing. Step dad is just trying to throw weight around he doesn't have.", "\u2026except that OP advocated for her kids in this case?", "that's so true!", "It doesn't say she was bought a horse, just paid for lessons, and pianos don't have to be expensive. Kids interests change. I played the saxophone as a kid and I don't now. I did ballet and stopped. Adults start and stop hobbies. I don't think they sound spoilled, perhaps indulged by uncles who understood their loss of a father.", "I disagree with the assumption that purchasing a piano that is later not played as much is spoiling. We don't even know if the piano was expensive. Even if it was, plenty of people buy things to support an interest that they then later let lapse. It's okay if no one became a world famous pianist off of it. That kind of thinking is so anti creative and drives me up a wall.", "The uncle purchased riding lessons, not a horse. \n\nAlso buying a piano is not what you might imagine. Second hand pianos are often cheap/free and the only cost is moving them. \n\nThese girls were privileged to have these extras but nothing here is mind-blowing. This is normal middle class kid stuff.", "Just because most of us can\u2019t afford to take horse lessons or lessons, doesn\u2019t mean those can\u2019t shouldn\u2019t or automatically become spoiled because within their reach to do this things. Allowing children to EXPLORE their hobbies and interests isn\u2019t spoiling.", "Reading comprehension is important. \n\nShe specifically said the uncles paid for lessons and \u201criding fees.\u201d That means they did not buy a horse. Riding fees literally means a fee you pay to ride a horse at a stable. If you owned the horse, there would be no fee to ride it. \n\nI\u2019m middle class and I\u2019ve done this for my children. While riding lessons are expensive relative to other activities like rec soccer, it\u2019s not extravagant. It\u2019s good for kids to explore their interests. \n\nCriticizing piano lessons is just flat out ridiculous. This is common even for working class and lower income families. How do you think all the church ladies learn to play???", "You're a great mom! My mom was like this, too, and I 100% benefitted from it in so many ways. I don't understand the mindset of your inlaws at all. Why even have kids? Ugh.\n\nThe idea that hobbies must lead to a job or fame or something is such a gross idea and I hate it. Let people play around!", "Or prior complaints. OP makes it abundantly clear that her husband and the other kids have made their opinion of what the uncles do for Stacy & her sister well known.\n\nPrior complaints alone would be enough for a smart person to recognize that this should be kept under their hat as long as possible.\n\nAnd just realized that in a way this is going to end up sucking for the younger sister. She has years left in that house with everyone knowing that her uncles will be paying for her college. If OP doesn't get everyone's attitudes straightened out now, the next several years could be a nightmare for the younger girl.", "If I know Reddit at all their will be a comment from op on how the husband wants the bil\u2019s to give the money to op and husband for the nicer college so they can split it up between all 5 kids and send them all to a state school.", "Except not because she thinks it's right but because it's easier. She says how it made her see red too. That she didn't want them to have those extracurricular the uncles treated them too.", "I have a free piano I can\u2019t give away.", "Exactly! The uncles kindly gave their nieces enriching experiences like horseback \ud83d\udc0e riding and piano lessons, that they might not have had other wise. If they were constantly buying the girls fancy clothes/toys/jewelry/electronics, then yes, might be potentially spoiling them. A college education should be available for anyone who wants one, NOT a luxury or debt pit.", "It goes further too, we seemed like those overscheduled assholes where we had our young kid doing this activity or that all the time (swim lessons from 4m-5y - only ending because of the pandemic, ice skating, running club, skateboarding, hockey, soccer, etc - throughout the year, not all at once.) But our kid has a growth delay where she is otherwise perfectly normal except her stature. This led to people questioning her constantly if she *should* or *could* do this or that and worse, some actively excluding her. So we consciously chose to let her try anything she expresses interest in so that she doesn't doubt her abilities and always believes in her body's ability to do this or that. The result is a kid who will try anything. Can't isn't in her vocabulary. Even if she quits every sport and doesn't continue anything for a lifetime, the confidence she built isn't a waste!\n\nI appreciate the feedback. My goal is to make her feel like she can do anything with practice and commitment. I don't care for my inlaws' perspective because they told my husband he could like one of two sports and those were his options. Nothing else. Then they didn't support him and actively worked against him - being late to practice despite having a SAHP, messing up communication with coaches, almost missing registration so he risked not being on his team. When my daughter told them she joined a team for a sport my husband did later in life and works in that industry now, his mom called people who do that crazy. Excuse me? That's your son's livelihood and a passion he shares with this kid who is excited to join this team is crazy? My brother and my husband's brother both started sports early in life and when their kids were young just kind of blew it off. So when they were older and had friends in sports, they finally got them involved but then were like, \"yeah, they're not as good as other kids...\" but do they practice with them or acknowledge the kids might have years more experience and coaching? Nope.", "I totally went to see if there was such a comment but was quite surprised there wasn\u2019t!", "I see those all the time. I think I bought my piano (fairly nice brand but older) for $200 and then the cost to rehab/tune it was a couple hundred. Not exactly breaking the bank as a one time investment.", "I was going to mention something similar to this.  I've helped multiple friends move their brand new (to them) free pianos.", "Heck, my family was pretty working class when I grew up but we were super rural and as such able to own a horse on the cheap. No showing or fancy gear, and not a lot of paid lessons (mom taught me mostly) and nothing like the expense of owning one in the city, which when I moved to an urban area I worked a lot of barter type stable work to be able to stay in it. We also had music lessons through school/church as a kid. The horse world has a very wide variety of involvement, from the truly spoiled rich girls who only show up to ride their very expensive show ponies, to the working riders who do the work in order to be able to scrape by in the world for the love of the animal/sport, to the many many people who fall in between those 2 extremes. We can't make assumptions on the level of spoiled anyone is just by the hobby they took lessons in for awhile."]}
