About a year after the divorce, he passed away. My ex was paying child support but that stopped the day he died. The girls inherited their father\u2019s estate but since he was fresh into his career, it wasn\u2019t much. Things could have been rough as a single mother but his brothers stepped into his shoes.\n\nThey took the girls on the weekends and basically bought the girls anything they needed from clothing to school supplies and bought our groceries. They also indulged the girls\u2019 every whim. Stacy loved horses when she was little so uncle John paid for her lessons and riding fees. Emily thought she wanted to play the piano so uncle Jeff paid for her lessons and bought her a piano. When the girls grew out of those phases and got interested in something else, their uncles were there ready to indulged them. I tried talking to the uncles about not spoiling my girls but they said that their nieces needed to explore their own interests and those explorations will help their brain developments. I disagree but was not in a financial situation to push too hard because they were paying so much for the girls, I was basically responsible for only the rent.\n\nI later remarried a wonderful man who brought 2 kids into the family. We had 1 more kid together and things are good for the most part. However kids are smart so my daughters\u2019 step and half siblings started to notice their sisters having more experiences and things than they do. My husband didn\u2019t like the situation and we had some arguments about it over the years. Things came to a boiling point recently when we were discussing how to pay for our two oldest kids\u2019 colleges (Stacy and her step brother Rick 18m). Both are good students and while they haven\u2019t gotten their acceptance letters, I have no doubt they\u2019ll get into good schools.\n\nMy husband and I make enough money to live a middle class lifestyle with 5 kids but not enough to put them through college. The reality is that they\u2019ll have to take out school loans. We talked to both of them about loans and this is when I found out Stacy had already talked to her uncles and they\u2019re paying for her tuition and cost of living wherever she wants to go. This floored us and made my husband extremely mad. He got red and started to scream how it\u2019s not fair Stacy and Emily will get to go to expensive colleges and graduate with no loans while our other kids will have to go to state schools and take out loans. He wanted me to call John and Jeff to tell them to stop spoiling the girls. On one hand I agree 100% with my husband that it\u2019s not fair to my other kids but on the other hand I can\u2019t hold my daughters back from something so wonderful.\n\nIn the end, I told my husband I\u2019m not going to tell my ex-BILs to stop spoiling our daughters.

It is absolutely NONE of his business.  If anything, he should be grateful!  I\u2019m sure their financial assistance has taken a great deal of financial responsibility off of yourself and HIS children have only benefitted from that!\n\nTell your husband to grow up and start taking responsibility for his own decisions and failings as a father.  Tell him to stop whining about what other people\u2019s children have and do something to provide his own children with the things he thinks they deserve.  Get a second job.

Its not spoiling kids to help them explore their interests or to pay for them to launch their lives debt free. Just because many won't have those advantages does not mean your ex's brothers are wrong for offering it to your girls. They don't need to suffer and struggle or be unfulfilled until everyone else has equal access to those advantages.

If not for their paying for this, who would pay for it? You or you and your husband would probably end up funding a large amount of it. The uncles paying for their education frees up the money you & husband would have spent on education for Stacy & Lucy to spend on the other kids\u2019 education or whatever else you want.

Not fair at all.", "NTA no you are not wrong and your husband is an AH that he thinks it's OK to take away from your daughters' family just because it gives them something his kids don't get. It's selfish, self-absorbed, and a sign of his own insecurities about money.", "NTA. Also a: now you don\u2019t have to worry about the two girls, just paying for the other kids. That is a win for you, right? B: how he does plan to STOP your girls uncles (because you refer to them as ex-BIL a lot, but there is nothing ex about their relation to the girls) spoiling them? Stacy is old enough she doesn\u2019t really need either of your permission to do anything. Your youngest might be cut off from them for awhile, but how are you going to stop them from paying for college for her once she goes? All that will accomplish is making her dislike you and probably jump ship to stay with her uncle the minute she is old enough.", "NTA.  Even if you were on your husband\u2019s side, I\u2019m not sure how either of you think you\u2019re supposed to interfere with an arrangement your soon-to-be 18 year old has worked out independently with her uncles, or stop Emily from doing the same when she comes of age.  This is clearly happening whether you like it or not, so your husband needs to accept that and come up with ways to support the other kids using available resources and scholarship research instead of resenting your older girls\u2019 good fortune.", "NTA. Your husband is. Assume that it\u2019s not your girls uncles but their father doing this, how would it be different? It wouldn\u2019t. Your girls have some awesome family and I am so glad they didn\u2019t miss out on life because they lost their dad. Your step children also have another parent, what if she were providing extravagance for your step children? How would that be different? Or is your husband jealous that your children don\u2019t have a dad but they have a whole family who love them and take care of them as if he were here and not abandoning them since he ain\u2019t. \n\nAt the end of the day isn\u2019t this a blessing for your step children, since your children are taken care of you are able to possibly help their father a little more with his children\u2019s tuition. \n\nIt seems to me that your husband thought he\u2019d be getting a wife with no strings since your ex isn\u2019t here anymore - he didn\u2019t bargain for the extended family to be a good one. \n\nWhere\u2019s his ex and her contribution to any of this?", "NTA, however, you\u2019re wrong about the \u201cfairness\u201d of the girls getting \u201cspoiled\u201d by their uncles.

He's making sure to help support his brothers children in his brothers absence. Truly, what a man. I wanna give that guy an award.\n\nYour current husband now only needs to pay for his own children, that saved him a lot of money. Your ex BIL is not related to your husbands kids and as long as he's not doing it to directly spite them then let the man treat his nieces the way he thinks his brother would have wanted them to be.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, with your ex passing.

They have their dad! Your daugthers lost their father and its amazing that his brothers stepped up. Your daughters will resent you if you talk to your ex Bils.  Talk to your husband instead and set up clear boundaries.", "NTA. Keep in mind your husband loves his kids more than yours, and their uncles make up for that as their father is dead. He wants you to prevent something irreplaceable that your former BILs - mature adults - want to do to help their late brothers\u2019 kids - who will also be adults at the time they pay the tuition.

As in, their older sisters have other family as well. Your idiot husband has no right to try to ruin anything good that they have. If nothing else, it will lower your overall costs for so many children. I\u2019d take a careful look - is he holding this against and being unkind to them?", "NTA. Your husband needs to understand that your daughters have a whole seperate family and while it may seem unfair to the other kids it would be absolutely unequivocal unfair and down right spiteful to stop your kids from enjoying the perks of their family.

You literally cannot do this!  Your eldest will shortly be 18 and you will have absolutely no say in what she accepts or who gives her money.  Try calling some college and telling not to accept uncle\u2019s money, lol.", "NTA\n\nLet me share a personal tid-bit:\n\nMy parents held me back from experiences because it wouldn\u2019t be fair to my step-brothers. I was more advanced, intellectually and athletically. While the step-brothers struggled with pretty much everything. \n\nIt\u2019s not a great experience to have your wings clipped by your parents because they are worried about favoritism. Your kids aren\u2019t equals in all things, and life isn\u2019t fair. My step-brothers won\u2019t talk to them and my parents are hoping I care for them in their old age should they need it because I\u2019m much more successful despite their best efforts. Fact is parents like that only care about their own egos and selves. Fairness goes out the window when it no longer benefits their well-being. \n\nYour daughters aren\u2019t being \u201cspoiled\u201d. Spoiled is about being ungrateful, not about having access.

Kinda weird that the narrative is the girls are spoilt from You and the stepdad, despite You knowing exactly why they're \"spoilt.\" Did he start calling them spoilt first and you went long with it? Seems like you have a lot of questions to ask yourself over how it got to this point? Because if you nipped it sooner, would it have got to this point?\n\n As it genuinely comes off that you've kind of thought of them both as spoilt for so long it's become the dominant narrative.", "NTA. Seems your husband has conveniently forgotten what your daughters lost to make this happen. No college fund is going to bring their father back. No amount of piano lessons will walk them down the aisle at their wedding. These girls lost one of their parents, and while I'm glad they have a support system it's not the same and never will be. Your husband is being very insensitive.", "INFO: Where is your stepkids bio Mum? It's the parents responsibility to create a trust fund for their kids. As a Step-parent who's only recently learned the father didn't set aside any money, his lack of preparation isn't your responsibility. The girls uncles have only stepped in because your girls father, your ex, their brother, passed away.

The other kids will have loans no matter what so why does he want to make sure the misery that is paying for college is spread around? He should be grateful that at least two of the kids will be spared that. \n\nHis outrage & whining is only going to make the other kids internalize some feeling of entitlement or of being wronged by their sisters that\u2019s just BS.

It\u2019s wonderful that the girls will be able to start their adult lives debt free. My parents helped me pay for college by matching the money I put down each semester. The rest I had to do in loans. I worked all through college to pay down the loans and interest.

They don't just push cash at them on holidays, they actively are invested in their interests. That's great!\n\nStop mistaking privileged as spoiled. *Completely different!* Also don't make the mistake that privileged is a negative thing. For example, your other kids are too. 1) They have their dad, your lone ones don't; that counts as a privilege. 2) The others also get more college money because any you had saved for the lone ones can now go to them.

So your husband\u2019s solution is that they should take out loans to make it fair? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that this grown man is lashing out at your girls being poured with love. Your ex-in law\u2019s generosity takes off the financial burden of your entire family and your husband here is bitching about it like a child with a temper tantrum. He needs to get over himself.

Your youngest shared child (and his children too, depending on their age) will benefit from this arrangement greatly. Even if the girls took out loans, you would likely help with all sorts of expenses, that are now covered, so take that money and put it in a savings/college fund.\n\nThink of it this way: What if one child gets a scholarship?

But, if your daughters have an opportunity to have their college paid for\u2026why would you turn that down? If one of them got a scholarship and your stepchild didn\u2019t, would you force your child to turn it down? Additionally, if your stepson had an uncle that would pay for his college, there is no way that your husband would be making the same argument. Btw - where is your stepson\u2019s mother?
