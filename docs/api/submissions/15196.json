Both your sisters are pregnant. It sounds like your trying to create drama where none exists.", "YTA. She didn't 'steal' any spotlight; she waited a week. That's totally reasonable and respectful.", "YTA \n\nNone of this is any of your business.", "YTA - it's not like she planned to get knocked up at the exact same time. She's allowed to be happy and want to announce it. It's not her fault some one else got to sooner. Should she wait till she's showing just because her other sister found out first?", "YTA. A pregnancy is not about a 'spotlight'. It's about growing your family. If anything, your sisters can be excited to share this experience together.", "YTA--They waited a week and had been trying.  A full week later isn't stealing the spotlight.  Also, it is a very special time for her as well.  Is she supposed to hide it and make sure your older sister has the only spotlight?  Once again, they had been trying so clearly this is a huge deal to them.  Honestly, just kind of sounds like you like one sister more than then the other.", "Did your older sister say that she felt her spotlight was stolen? Your younger sister was actively trying to get pregnant, and she had the decency to wait a week. \n\nCongratulate her and apologize. YTA.", "YTA When my mum annonced she was pregnant with my sibling, her sister started giggeling because she was pregnant too. Then her sil joined them with her own pregnancy annoncement. You know what we all did? Celebrated the miracle of three babies.", "YTA. You just said it takes away from your other sister's announcement of pregnancy while YOU just took away from them.\n\nYou DID precisely what you accused her of doing.\n\nWho fucking cares when they announce their pregnancy, it is THEIR choice when to announce it. It is NOT the same as proposing at a wedding.", "YTA. You cannot possible expect people to plan the conception of babies in order to preserve people\u2019s \u201cspecial time.\u201d You don\u2019t get to reserve a time to be pregnant where no one else is allowed to conceive. And two weeks is plenty of time to wait before telling people. \nPlus this way the cousins will be really close in age which is awesome.", "YTA. You should be just as excited for her. Double the fun. Check your attitude.", "YTA. Wtf? She did nothing wrong.", "YTA.  Pregnancy announcements and weddings are not the same thing.  There's protocol for the latter, but not the former.", "YTA. They waited a week, and she's not 'stealing a spotlight,' she's telling friends and family she's gonna have a whole ass person. Weird thing for you to do, especially with the added context that you and I'm assuming others knew she and her partner were trying to get pregnant.", "YTA- she did wait, she did allow the other sister to have a special moment by not telling everyone on the same day.  Older sister will get special time as she will be having her baby first.    Yes you are wrong.", "YTA. It makes no difference whether she tells people now or later, seeing that it seems like they're going to be due more or less at the same time so they're going to have to share the attention for most of their pregnancies. The spotlight can be shared. Also you're getting upset on behalf of your older sister - did you even ask her if she was fine with it or not? Either way, you're not the gatekeeper of news sharing.", "YTA - she was probably already planning on how to share it with the family when your other sister came out with it - she could've brought it up then and there but she waited. She had no interest in the spotlight. Also, why can't more than one person be pregnant at once? Pregnancy is not a race or contest. Be supportive of BOTH of your sisters' big moments.", "So what does your older sister have to say about this?

At most, your older sister had a right to tell her something, and still i'd think it was a bullshit argument, but you? You got nothing to do here.\n\nAlso, \"she looked a little nervous\" means she was about to say something and thought, hey, perhaps this isn't the best of times, i'll ruin her moment, i'll wait another week, so it's not like she wasn't thinking about her sister's happiness... unlike you.", "YTA - Of course she has  the right to tell everyone and at least she was nice enough to wait another week. \n\nSometimes I really wonder how people can waste their energy on things like that and how this can BOTHER anyone. Why were you triggered? I fail to understand  that.", "YTA. How is this anyones business but theirs.", "YTA. This isn't your fight to fight, stay out of it. This idea of people owning some sort of a \"spotlight\" period is out of control. Making a simple baby announcement is not the same as commandeering a wedding someone paid thousands of dollars for in order to pursue one's own agenda.", "YTA\n\nWhy do so many people think that family joy is some sort of limited resource?", "Yta. What are you gonna do if the kids birthdays  are close? Does the younger one have to wait a month to celebrate? Each of your siblings is an individual moving independently and separately not everything is done BECAUSE or to spite someone else.", "YTA - She's right she can tell people whenever she wants.", "Guess what? There is enough joy to go around. Being happy for one sister does not take away from the other. And, your sister gets to decide when to reveal things, even if in the risky zone. YTA. Even by normal judges standards... she did not announce the same day or the day after. She did give a pause in time though she clearly knew.", "YTA.They did wait a week, they didn't do it at the same time. What magic number isn't tacky spotlight stealing? What makes a month okay?", "Info: At what event was the older sister's pregnancy announced? Was it a regular dinner you all do together often? How far along was she?\n\nWas she actually upset, or are you upset?", "YTA\n\nShe didn't steal the spotlight at all.\nShe waited until a week later.\nShe probably wants to share the experience of being pregnant with her sister. \n\nYou sound extremely petty.", "YTA. what is with this ridiculous notion that someone needs all the attention on them because of some announcement about their life. how long does it last? a week, a month, a year! Just stop it already! She could have said it right then when her sister said it and it STILL would have been fine.", "YTA. She did wait. She didn\u2019t steal the spotlight at your older sister\u2019s announcement.", "Wow, way to tell her what she can and can not do with her body and her medical information. Can you hear yourself? YTA", "YTA, She didn't steal the spotlight. She could have said it on the spot. I guess she planned to tell the pregnancy at the event two weeks ago and the older sister came first. So she decided to postpone it another week. It's alone her decision, when she wants to announce the pregnancy. Also there are millions of people pregnant, you can't reserve the right of pregnancy for your own.  \n\n\nJust a curious question, would you also be upset, if your younger sister announced the pregnancy first and your older sister announced it a week later (so the exact opposite timing). If you would answer no, then i have to tell you, that you are playing favorites within your sisters and act like your younger sister is the black sheep.  You should work on that. It's not like she bought the same car on purpose. At the time, she got pregnant, she didn't know that her older sister was pregnant, too.", "YTA, just because your older sister announced first doesn\u2019t mean she has a monopoly on pregnancies for the duration. And if she was upset, she can use her words and say something, or perhaps she was more of an adult and realize that her feelings aren\u2019t really justified.", "Are you the pregnancy announcement police? YTA.", "YTA. Your younger sister isn\u2019t out of line for not observing a rule made up by you. This is especially true when your older sister isn\u2019t even offended.  But regardless, waiting a week and making a distinct announcement from your older sister are the only etiquette concerns and she followed them.", "YTA\n\nWhy should they have to keep their pregnancy secret just because it happened at the same time as your sister?  Not to mention, it's none of your business... if your older sister has a problem with it, she can talk to your younger sister herself.", "YTA.  How does this concern you?  Now you\u2019ve taken away what should have been a happy moment from your sister.", "YTA, and you know it.", "YTA if only for calling your own sister \"trashy\".  How did it \"steal\" anything from your older sister?  That is simply ridiculous.  You owe your younger sister a HUGE apology--and when the baby shower comes your gift needs to be EXTRAVAGANT to the MAX to make up for your bad manners.", "YTA.  This is one of the silliest things to make a fuss over that I've seen on here.  Why this even bothers you speaks to a mindset that I find to be very obnoxious.", "YTA...stealing the spotlight would've been her jumping straight up off the couch when your older sister announced and screaming \"OMG, me too!!\" She waited a week to give your sister a chance to be celebrated. It's just happenstance that they both got pregnant around the same time, what difference would another month have made?", "YTA\n\nIn a supportive family, one announcement does not take away the positives of another announcement and instead should only add to the excitement.\n\nYou had no right saying this to your sister or speaking on behalf of your older sister.", "YTA\nShe is not \"stealing the spotlight\". If ya said she announced it at the baby Party or wedding- yeah ok.\nThey were also let her have her moment, because she already knew at the time.\n\nThe pregnancy won't be less special for your older sister just because the younger is pregnant too.\nMaybe they even connect trough there experience of being pregnant at the same time.", "YTA - So you're going to ruin your little sister's excitement because you think it infringes on your older sister's? You're just creating drama when it's none of your business. Your sister did wait and let the day be about your other sister, and then the next week she announced her own pregnancy. Did you think expecting mothers get a whole month of praise and \"special\" moments? Other people have important things going on in their lives too.", "YTA keep you unwanted opinions to yourself.", "YTA. The first announcement doesn't come with exclusive rights to a spotlight for a month! They get their congratulations and happy conversations for a week or so, and then life is back to normal for everyone else. A newly pregnant couple shouldn't be denied a month of care and support from their family because another couple wants the spotlight and got there first. \n\nThere should be enough joy to go around!", "YTA. The only way she would\u2019ve been \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d is if she announced her pregnancy the same day and it seems like she specifically waited a week so that she wasn\u2019t doing that. This is not even close to being the same things as proposing at a wedding. Plus it doesn\u2019t matter what you think about this. Have you asked your older sister how she feels about your younger sisters pregnancy announcement being so close to hers? This literally does not affect you at all and there is no reason for you to be upset about it, especially if your older sister isn\u2019t upset about it.", "YTA\n\nThey can share the news whenever they want. It\u2019s just announcing a pregnancy, not a wedding ceremony costing thousands of dollars. As others have said, this is not any of your business.", "YTA - \n\nThis whole \"announcement\" thing seems more and more to be an emotional trap for people to be judged for their level of excitement and for how long the announcer is entitled to be the center of attention.   \n\nShe didn't show up to a party for some other guest of honor to hijack the day, nor at someone's wedding or funeral, she's just a pregnant woman of let the family know a new addition is on the way.   \n\nJust relax and let everyone be.  \n\nThat you feel it's \"tacky and trashy\" shows that you feel some sort of entitlement to fake social norms you make up in your head.", "YTA\n\nThere isn't a first come first serve on pregnancy announcements where only one couple can give their news. They did wait but you stole both of their thunder by making unnecessary family drama.", "There's some protocol about when to announce pregnancy? /s \n\nDon't announce in the same week or month as a sibling... don't announce six months after a funeral... don't announce after eating oysters. \n\nYou're behaving ridiculously. Yeah, YTA.", "YTA. She respected your sister\u2019s moment and waited a week to announce. When to announce a pregnancy is an incredibly personal decision and you don\u2019t get to dictate that for other people. She would still be pregnant whether she announced or not which could have led to hurt feelings or misunderstandings if her own pregnancy symptoms left her unable to help your older sister or something like that.", "YTA. Do you even understand how you completely ruined the moment for your sister? She's allowed to have a special time, too, whenever the hell she wants to.", "YTA...You have to time telling your family what's going on in your life? Ridiculous!", "YTA - This is not a wedding. They can announce whenever they want.", "YTA and you really suck as a sister. They had been trying for a long time, your older sister hadn't and she and hubby were accepting of the fact that if it was, then it was. YOU still had to do your thing. Terrible play trying to justify it.", "YTA. I don't get why it's such a problem to be happy for both people. Is there really so much jealousy that a special moment cannot be shared?

One would think there may even be some excitement about having someone to share the experience with.", "My oldest sister announced to our parents that they were pregnant after years of trying.

That IS someone\u2019s time to shine.", "YTA, she told everyone a week later, and she and her partner were trying to conceive so it's not like the news came out of the blue.\n\nIt comes off as jealousy to me, your sisters are pregnant which is an exciting time in their lives. Don't bring your sister down to make yourself feel better.", "YTA.  They were both trying at the same time.  She waited a week.  That was enough.  Your older sister doesn't need more than a week to bask in the glory of announcing a pregnancy.  And it sounds like you did this of your own accord and not because your older sister was upset.", "Have you always favored your older sister over your younger one, or is this a more recent development?", "I really need someone to explain to me why grown adults need \u2018the spotlight\u2019.  It\u2019s possible to be happy for more than one person at once.", "YTA- your younger sister waited to announce so even if your older sister had a gathering to announce, it wasn't a faux pas for your younger sister to announce her pregnancy a week later.", "YTA \n\nThis is dumb, I get you\u2019re looking out for you older sister but this isn\u2019t your fight to start. If anything I would think you older sister would be happy to have someone to relate too and it\u2019s also pretty exciting that there will be a cousin so close in age to her child.", "Yta\n\n\nCelebrating happiness is never a bad thing. Stop thinking you can take someone's joy just because you also have happy news.\n\n\nThis is gross and entitled behavior.\n\n\nBoth of your sisters have wonderful news.

You're taking it even farther - berating your little sis on behalf of someone who doesn't even care!  Get back in your lane, this is LITERALLY none of your business, and you're creating drama for absolutely no reason.  Happiness is not a zero sum game.

This is exactly the same with my sister there is 3 months between our pregnancy she is due in may I am September. You should all be happy that your family is getting bless with 2 babies!

Your older sister has a brain, and she can communicate herself if she so chooses. She didn't choose to do so. She didn't ask for you to speak for her, nor did she outright complain about it. You saw a facial expression and just freely assumed that your older sister was upset over the announcement.\n\n\n\nHer facial expression could have been from pregnancy symptoms, food poisoning, remembering an awkward moment, planning what to have for dinner, or anything else under the sun. Maybe she was concerned over their stability, or maybe she had bad news that she didn't want to share that may not have been your business. Only she knows.\n\n\n\nTbh, if I was your older sister, I would be furious with you for trying to speak for me, even ***if*** your guess was correct.

See it like that, your other sister the spotlight for herself for a week, your other sister won\u2019t even have it for a day. You should apologize and try to make it up with something nice.
