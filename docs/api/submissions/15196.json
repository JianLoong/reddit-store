Both your sisters are pregnant. It sounds like your trying to create drama where none exists.", "YTA. She didn't 'steal' any spotlight; she waited a week. That's totally reasonable and respectful.", "YTA \n\nNone of this is any of your business.", "YTA - it's not like she planned to get knocked up at the exact same time. She's allowed to be happy and want to announce it. It's not her fault some one else got to sooner. Should she wait till she's showing just because her other sister found out first?", "YTA. A pregnancy is not about a 'spotlight'. It's about growing your family. If anything, your sisters can be excited to share this experience together.", "YTA--They waited a week and had been trying.  A full week later isn't stealing the spotlight.  Also, it is a very special time for her as well.  Is she supposed to hide it and make sure your older sister has the only spotlight?  Once again, they had been trying so clearly this is a huge deal to them.  Honestly, just kind of sounds like you like one sister more than then the other.", "Did your older sister say that she felt her spotlight was stolen? Your younger sister was actively trying to get pregnant, and she had the decency to wait a week. \n\nCongratulate her and apologize. YTA.", "YTA When my mum annonced she was pregnant with my sibling, her sister started giggeling because she was pregnant too. Then her sil joined them with her own pregnancy annoncement. You know what we all did? Celebrated the miracle of three babies.", "YTA. You just said it takes away from your other sister's announcement of pregnancy while YOU just took away from them.\n\nYou DID precisely what you accused her of doing.\n\nWho fucking cares when they announce their pregnancy, it is THEIR choice when to announce it. It is NOT the same as proposing at a wedding.", "YTA. You cannot possible expect people to plan the conception of babies in order to preserve people\u2019s \u201cspecial time.\u201d You don\u2019t get to reserve a time to be pregnant where no one else is allowed to conceive. And two weeks is plenty of time to wait before telling people. \nPlus this way the cousins will be really close in age which is awesome.", "YTA. You should be just as excited for her. Double the fun. Check your attitude.", "YTA. Wtf? She did nothing wrong.", "YTA.  Pregnancy announcements and weddings are not the same thing.  There's protocol for the latter, but not the former.", "YTA. They waited a week, and she's not 'stealing a spotlight,' she's telling friends and family she's gonna have a whole ass person. Weird thing for you to do, especially with the added context that you and I'm assuming others knew she and her partner were trying to get pregnant.", "YTA- she did wait, she did allow the other sister to have a special moment by not telling everyone on the same day.  Older sister will get special time as she will be having her baby first.    Yes you are wrong.", "YTA. It makes no difference whether she tells people now or later, seeing that it seems like they're going to be due more or less at the same time so they're going to have to share the attention for most of their pregnancies. The spotlight can be shared. Also you're getting upset on behalf of your older sister - did you even ask her if she was fine with it or not? Either way, you're not the gatekeeper of news sharing.", "YTA - she was probably already planning on how to share it with the family when your other sister came out with it - she could've brought it up then and there but she waited. She had no interest in the spotlight. Also, why can't more than one person be pregnant at once? Pregnancy is not a race or contest. Be supportive of BOTH of your sisters' big moments.", "So what does your older sister have to say about this?

At most, your older sister had a right to tell her something, and still i'd think it was a bullshit argument, but you? You got nothing to do here.\n\nAlso, \"she looked a little nervous\" means she was about to say something and thought, hey, perhaps this isn't the best of times, i'll ruin her moment, i'll wait another week, so it's not like she wasn't thinking about her sister's happiness... unlike you.", "YTA - Of course she has  the right to tell everyone and at least she was nice enough to wait another week. \n\nSometimes I really wonder how people can waste their energy on things like that and how this can BOTHER anyone. Why were you triggered? I fail to understand  that.", "YTA. How is this anyones business but theirs.", "YTA. This isn't your fight to fight, stay out of it. This idea of people owning some sort of a \"spotlight\" period is out of control. Making a simple baby announcement is not the same as commandeering a wedding someone paid thousands of dollars for in order to pursue one's own agenda.", "YTA\n\nWhy do so many people think that family joy is some sort of limited resource?", "Yta. What are you gonna do if the kids birthdays  are close? Does the younger one have to wait a month to celebrate? Each of your siblings is an individual moving independently and separately not everything is done BECAUSE or to spite someone else.", "YTA - She's right she can tell people whenever she wants.", "Guess what? There is enough joy to go around. Being happy for one sister does not take away from the other. And, your sister gets to decide when to reveal things, even if in the risky zone. YTA. Even by normal judges standards... she did not announce the same day or the day after. She did give a pause in time though she clearly knew.", "YTA.They did wait a week, they didn't do it at the same time. What magic number isn't tacky spotlight stealing? What makes a month okay?", "Info: At what event was the older sister's pregnancy announced? Was it a regular dinner you all do together often? How far along was she?\n\nWas she actually upset, or are you upset?", "YTA\n\nShe didn't steal the spotlight at all.\nShe waited until a week later.\nShe probably wants to share the experience of being pregnant with her sister. \n\nYou sound extremely petty.", "YTA. what is with this ridiculous notion that someone needs all the attention on them because of some announcement about their life. how long does it last? a week, a month, a year! Just stop it already! She could have said it right then when her sister said it and it STILL would have been fine.", "YTA. She did wait. She didn\u2019t steal the spotlight at your older sister\u2019s announcement.", "Wow, way to tell her what she can and can not do with her body and her medical information. Can you hear yourself? YTA", "YTA, She didn't steal the spotlight. She could have said it on the spot. I guess she planned to tell the pregnancy at the event two weeks ago and the older sister came first. So she decided to postpone it another week. It's alone her decision, when she wants to announce the pregnancy. Also there are millions of people pregnant, you can't reserve the right of pregnancy for your own.  \n\n\nJust a curious question, would you also be upset, if your younger sister announced the pregnancy first and your older sister announced it a week later (so the exact opposite timing). If you would answer no, then i have to tell you, that you are playing favorites within your sisters and act like your younger sister is the black sheep.  You should work on that. It's not like she bought the same car on purpose. At the time, she got pregnant, she didn't know that her older sister was pregnant, too.", "YTA, just because your older sister announced first doesn\u2019t mean she has a monopoly on pregnancies for the duration. And if she was upset, she can use her words and say something, or perhaps she was more of an adult and realize that her feelings aren\u2019t really justified.", "Are you the pregnancy announcement police? YTA.", "YTA. Your younger sister isn\u2019t out of line for not observing a rule made up by you. This is especially true when your older sister isn\u2019t even offended.  But regardless, waiting a week and making a distinct announcement from your older sister are the only etiquette concerns and she followed them.", "YTA\n\nWhy should they have to keep their pregnancy secret just because it happened at the same time as your sister?  Not to mention, it's none of your business... if your older sister has a problem with it, she can talk to your younger sister herself.", "YTA.  How does this concern you?  Now you\u2019ve taken away what should have been a happy moment from your sister.", "YTA, and you know it.", "YTA if only for calling your own sister \"trashy\".  How did it \"steal\" anything from your older sister?  That is simply ridiculous.  You owe your younger sister a HUGE apology--and when the baby shower comes your gift needs to be EXTRAVAGANT to the MAX to make up for your bad manners.", "YTA.  This is one of the silliest things to make a fuss over that I've seen on here.  Why this even bothers you speaks to a mindset that I find to be very obnoxious.", "YTA...stealing the spotlight would've been her jumping straight up off the couch when your older sister announced and screaming \"OMG, me too!!\" She waited a week to give your sister a chance to be celebrated. It's just happenstance that they both got pregnant around the same time, what difference would another month have made?", "YTA\n\nIn a supportive family, one announcement does not take away the positives of another announcement and instead should only add to the excitement.\n\nYou had no right saying this to your sister or speaking on behalf of your older sister.", "YTA\nShe is not \"stealing the spotlight\". If ya said she announced it at the baby Party or wedding- yeah ok.\nThey were also let her have her moment, because she already knew at the time.\n\nThe pregnancy won't be less special for your older sister just because the younger is pregnant too.\nMaybe they even connect trough there experience of being pregnant at the same time.", "YTA - So you're going to ruin your little sister's excitement because you think it infringes on your older sister's? You're just creating drama when it's none of your business. Your sister did wait and let the day be about your other sister, and then the next week she announced her own pregnancy. Did you think expecting mothers get a whole month of praise and \"special\" moments? Other people have important things going on in their lives too.", "YTA keep you unwanted opinions to yourself.", "YTA. The first announcement doesn't come with exclusive rights to a spotlight for a month! They get their congratulations and happy conversations for a week or so, and then life is back to normal for everyone else. A newly pregnant couple shouldn't be denied a month of care and support from their family because another couple wants the spotlight and got there first. \n\nThere should be enough joy to go around!", "YTA. The only way she would\u2019ve been \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d is if she announced her pregnancy the same day and it seems like she specifically waited a week so that she wasn\u2019t doing that. This is not even close to being the same things as proposing at a wedding. Plus it doesn\u2019t matter what you think about this. Have you asked your older sister how she feels about your younger sisters pregnancy announcement being so close to hers? This literally does not affect you at all and there is no reason for you to be upset about it, especially if your older sister isn\u2019t upset about it.", "YTA\n\nThey can share the news whenever they want. It\u2019s just announcing a pregnancy, not a wedding ceremony costing thousands of dollars. As others have said, this is not any of your business.", "YTA - \n\nThis whole \"announcement\" thing seems more and more to be an emotional trap for people to be judged for their level of excitement and for how long the announcer is entitled to be the center of attention.   \n\nShe didn't show up to a party for some other guest of honor to hijack the day, nor at someone's wedding or funeral, she's just a pregnant woman of let the family know a new addition is on the way.   \n\nJust relax and let everyone be.  \n\nThat you feel it's \"tacky and trashy\" shows that you feel some sort of entitlement to fake social norms you make up in your head.", "YTA\n\nThere isn't a first come first serve on pregnancy announcements where only one couple can give their news. They did wait but you stole both of their thunder by making unnecessary family drama.", "There's some protocol about when to announce pregnancy? /s \n\nDon't announce in the same week or month as a sibling... don't announce six months after a funeral... don't announce after eating oysters. \n\nYou're behaving ridiculously. Yeah, YTA.", "YTA. She respected your sister\u2019s moment and waited a week to announce. When to announce a pregnancy is an incredibly personal decision and you don\u2019t get to dictate that for other people. She would still be pregnant whether she announced or not which could have led to hurt feelings or misunderstandings if her own pregnancy symptoms left her unable to help your older sister or something like that.", "YTA. Do you even understand how you completely ruined the moment for your sister? She's allowed to have a special time, too, whenever the hell she wants to.", "YTA...You have to time telling your family what's going on in your life? Ridiculous!", "YTA - This is not a wedding. They can announce whenever they want.", "YTA and you really suck as a sister. They had been trying for a long time, your older sister hadn't and she and hubby were accepting of the fact that if it was, then it was. YOU still had to do your thing. Terrible play trying to justify it.", "YTA. I don't get why it's such a problem to be happy for both people. Is there really so much jealousy that a special moment cannot be shared?

One would think there may even be some excitement about having someone to share the experience with.", "My oldest sister announced to our parents that they were pregnant after years of trying.

That IS someone\u2019s time to shine.", "YTA, she told everyone a week later, and she and her partner were trying to conceive so it's not like the news came out of the blue.\n\nIt comes off as jealousy to me, your sisters are pregnant which is an exciting time in their lives. Don't bring your sister down to make yourself feel better.", "YTA.  They were both trying at the same time.  She waited a week.  That was enough.  Your older sister doesn't need more than a week to bask in the glory of announcing a pregnancy.  And it sounds like you did this of your own accord and not because your older sister was upset.", "Have you always favored your older sister over your younger one, or is this a more recent development?", "I really need someone to explain to me why grown adults need \u2018the spotlight\u2019.  It\u2019s possible to be happy for more than one person at once.", "YTA- your younger sister waited to announce so even if your older sister had a gathering to announce, it wasn't a faux pas for your younger sister to announce her pregnancy a week later.", "YTA \n\nThis is dumb, I get you\u2019re looking out for you older sister but this isn\u2019t your fight to start. If anything I would think you older sister would be happy to have someone to relate too and it\u2019s also pretty exciting that there will be a cousin so close in age to her child.", "Yta\n\n\nCelebrating happiness is never a bad thing. Stop thinking you can take someone's joy just because you also have happy news.\n\n\nThis is gross and entitled behavior.\n\n\nBoth of your sisters have wonderful news.

She probably looked uncomfortable because she wanted to announce too, but didn\u2019t want to steal her sister\u2019s spotlight. So she waited. And instead of you being happy for her, you accused her of stealing the spotlight. Which she intentionally tried not to do. She was excited and wanted to share the news with her family.

You're taking it even farther - berating your little sis on behalf of someone who doesn't even care!  Get back in your lane, this is LITERALLY none of your business, and you're creating drama for absolutely no reason.  Happiness is not a zero sum game.

This is exactly the same with my sister there is 3 months between our pregnancy she is due in may I am September. You should all be happy that your family is getting bless with 2 babies!

Your older sister has a brain, and she can communicate herself if she so chooses. She didn't choose to do so. She didn't ask for you to speak for her, nor did she outright complain about it. You saw a facial expression and just freely assumed that your older sister was upset over the announcement.\n\n\n\nHer facial expression could have been from pregnancy symptoms, food poisoning, remembering an awkward moment, planning what to have for dinner, or anything else under the sun. Maybe she was concerned over their stability, or maybe she had bad news that she didn't want to share that may not have been your business. Only she knows.\n\n\n\nTbh, if I was your older sister, I would be furious with you for trying to speak for me, even ***if*** your guess was correct.

See it like that, your other sister the spotlight for herself for a week, your other sister won\u2019t even have it for a day. You should apologize and try to make it up with something nice.

And even if your sisters *do not want to share it together* they still happen to be pregnant at the same time and one should not have to forgo celebrating with their families because you so clearly hold some kind of resentment for your younger sister. She will notice this and she will always remember it.", "YTA. Dude, be happy for your sisters!", "YTA, insane you would care enough to say anything.", "YTA. How is this even a question? Was she supposed to wait til it was absolutely obvious? They were known to be trying for a child and you're saying they timed the announcement badly? Unborn children can be so damned inconsiderate when it comes to conception. Get a grip.", "YTA - Your younger sister waited a week to make her announcement and you think she is TA.  Wow - You really need to rethink your attitude here.  You should be praising her for knowing she was also pregnant and not immediately standing up and saying \"Me Too\".  This is not a wedding.", "I mean you could of just said congratulations to both parties. Had some cake and wine and moved on? No one cares enough it was \u2018announced\u2019 within a week of each other surely?", "Yta what the hell were you thinking she's pregnant she gets to announce it", "YTA. This is none of your business. Your sister can do whatever she wants.", "YTA she didn\u2019t announce it the same day- she\u2019s right that it\u2019s her business to announce when she wants to. Good on your family for blasting you. Not necessary what you said at all, and definitely out of line.", "YTA - If she would have immediately said \u201cwe are pregnant too\u201d that would have been stealing the spotlight. She didn\u2019t say anything and waited a week. She\u2019s allowed to get pregnant at the same time as someone else, announce and be happy about her pregnancy.", "YTA. I use to think this way but I don\u2019t anymore.\nA few years back I had a miscarriage at about 6 weeks. I was devastated to say the least, but then a few weeks later my sister finally told me she was pregnant and started crying (she real tough I rarely see her cry) she was so scared to tell me because she didn\u2019t want to make me upset. I told her I was so happy and that I could never be upset with someone for something that happened to me when it was nobodies fault. My whole family knew and once she told me it was like a sigh of relief for everyone. \nSo yeah, you have no right making your sister feel bad.", "YTA Holy crap, is this real?

You\u2019re causing a problem where there doesn\u2019t need to be one.", "What\u2019s with this \u2018stealing the spotlight\u2019 thing that people are so obsessed with lately? They really think only one person can have news or an event at the same time?

Both your sisters are pregnant, your parents must be overjoyed even more because younger sister was TRYING", "YTA big time.

Should they hide their bumps til Princess delivers!", "YTA there is no spot light in pregnancy announcements. Be happy you get to welcome two new babies in the next 7-8 months .", "YTA and people in general have too much free time on their hands to create first world problems. I am sure you parents have the capacity to hear about 2 pregnancies in 7 days and can give attention/ congratulations appropriately.\n\nNext you will be suggesting she moves her induction date to not have the child in the same week (or keep birthing day a secret)  because God forbid your family gives attention to 2 grandkids instead of 1.

Again she did wait a week. She looked the way she did as they might have been going to announce it but waited so older had her spotlight.", "YTA you\u2019re tacky", "I don\u2019t even understand why she even needed to wait to announce her pregnancy. Like, one pregnancy = one happiness, then two = double happiness. Isn\u2019t good news supposed to be shared so everyone can be happy together?\n\nIdk, probably I\u2019m the weird one for focusing on the happy news itself rather than on who got the spotlight.", "YTA.  What is your problem?  What is the winning move here?  Should your sister have waited six months before springing the news on everyone that she was six months pregnant?  How would your parents feel about having to wait so long for that news? Babies come when babies come.  It's no wonder your parents put you on blast.  You have some weird ideas about babies.  They're not accessories that you buy at a shop to show off to your friends.  They're living breathing human beings who need to be valued as such, not for bragging rights on Instagram and Tik Tok.", "YTA. A proposal you can control when it happens. You can\u2019t control when you get pregnant.", "YTA-let your sisters enjoy their pregnancies together and don\u2019t cause any unnecessary stress for them.

She did just fine with a week wait time.", "YTA. she didn't steal her sister's spotlight. She let her have it for a full week, THEN announced her pregnancy.

When the other sister's is born and she's ready to pop too??? Get real.", "Easy YTA", "YTA. What a petty and shallow way to look at good news. Kid is gonna be born, so everyone would know they were pregnant at the same time anyway. Unnecessary drama in the midst of what should be happiness for all involved.", "ESH (Except the older sister) but I have a specific reason OP should've considered instead of their actual reasoning. You should never tell anyone except your doctor that you're pregnant before 12-14 weeks due to the risks of losing the child.", "...so she waited 3 weeks? What, you want her to wait till after she has the baby?", "YTA. She waited a week before announcing her pregnancy. There was no spotlight to be stolen at that point.", "Assuming you have a normal, not-terrible family, why would this be anything other than a super happy occasion?

I never cease to be amazed by how much people fucking care about other peoples' business. It's not a fucking attention contest.

It doesn\u2019t matter ffs.", "YTA. It's not like she got pregnant specifically to steal the spotlight. You were incredibly rude to her.", "YTA-How dare she want to tell her family about the pregnancy that she and her boyfriend have been trying for and are undoubtably excited about?? Also, did it dawn on you that perhaps she and her boyfriend were uncomfortable at the other sister\u2019s announcement because THEY had been planning to announce then?

It isn't like they announced it at the exact same time. Older sister had some time to celebrate and have the attention on her. Younger sister did announce earlier than some people do, sure, but that is her business if she wants to share early on in the pregnancy.", "YTA. She has the right to tell people whenever she wants.", "YTA - if it was the same day, sure, sucky timing. She waited two weeks and it doesn\u2019t sound like she made a big deal about it.

I was shocked that the one sister would announce at 6 weeks. Still probably yta because the issue (if any) is between your sisters.

Did you ever think she was planning on announcing it the same day your sister did, and held back because of your sister's announcement?\n\nAnd how hard would it be to wait a month, while listening to everyone's joy towards sister's pregnancy?\n\nLil sis should not have to pretend she isn't pregnant just because her sister is pregnant. She should not be \"socially obligated\" to hide her joy.", "It\u2019s not like proposing at a wedding at all. She can share her pregnancy news when she feels. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhy on earth are you getting involved at all???", "YTA- you can\u2019t really plan things like this. Its not like she was planning on ways to steal the spotlight these things just happen like that sometimes. And fertility is nothing like stealing the moment from proposing. One of things you can control and it\u2019s not pregnancy your BIL was right to go with if it happens it happens. You should be happy for them too. I know sisters who where we pregnant 2 weeks apart and give birth to their babies 22 hours apart. It just happens you can\u2019t plan the outcome.", "I wonder if OP feels left out?

It\u2019s great that they\u2019re having a baby, but other people don\u2019t need to hide that they\u2019re also having a baby for some imaginary spotlight. People get pregnant every single day. I\u2019m happy for people and your growing families, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t also be happy for other people and their growing families. It\u2019s not taking something away from someone to be happy for multiple pregnant people. You\u2019re not more or less special based on when you announce your pregnancy compared to someone else. If you\u2019re the type to get upset that someone announced their pregnancy a week after yours, you should go to therapy before you spend your entire life being upset that other people have similar life events as you around the same time as you", "Even if she burst out and said \"OMG ME TOO!\".

Your other sister can't be happy for her, the other's pregnancy, either?  Jeez.  What a group.", "Seems like OP favors the older sister.", "Being mad at your sister over this is kinda tacky and trashy... just saying...", "Tell us you don't like your younger sister without saying you don't like her.", "Gestational general \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I told my family I was pregnant, and my s-i-l said, \"Oh my gosh, me too!\" and we both hugged and jumped around like excited idiots. I know I'm really old, but it never felt like a \"spotlight\" thing to me.and I don't remember people talking about it that way. We were both thrilled for each other, and our adult children are still very fond of each other.", "Haha my sister and I got pregnant at the same time too - both not planned and both of our 3rd. We found out on the same day within 20 minutes of each other and our babies were born 12 days apart.", "I mean, seriously! My one sister & I have been trading off pregnancies lol she had a baby in 2018, I had a baby a year later in November 2019, then she had a baby the following May '20, then we BOTH got pregnant with babies due in July 2021, then I had a baby this past December and she's currently pregnant with her 4th and final due in June.\n\nLike, what? Oh no.....the cousins....will be close in age....a tragedy.....\n\nWtf, OP.", "Hey guys, get a load of Mrs. \u201cI\u2019m a normal and mature person with a great outlook on life\u201d over here", "Was it on accident or on purpose lol", "What you mean to say is \\*you\\* wait until 12. Lots of people announce well before that. A lot of people are just excited and want to tell everyone. If the younger sister wanted to steal the spotlight, she would have announced in the same gathering instead of waiting a week.", "I don\u2019t trust it when anyone on this sub says \u201c[person] seemed [emotion]\u201d it\u2019s a red flag for bias, because OP can never read minds, so they\u2019re just jumping to conclusions about how another feels, unless [person] explicitly TOLD them that they feel that way", "Twice my sil have been pregnant qt the same time. Boh trying but not knowing the other was. There's 2 weeks between our oldest and 6 weeks between our second.\n\nIt was never a problem. We're both capable adults who can celebrate eachother without feeling like it takes away from our joy. \n\nI think op is just looking for an excuse to be butt hurt.", "My SIL ended up pregnant just after my sister too. So my daughter has a cousin on my side and twins on my husband's side that are the same age as her. It's pretty fun TBH. No one feels any thunder is lost, only extra happy to have had someone to commiserate with. It was so awesome at my shower to have so many pregnant bellies and people excited about it all.", "My nephew was two weeks early!! Lol! Even weirder is that my son and daughter were both born on their due dates, and we're both the exact same size and weight, and my nephew ended up being the exact same size! It was so weird.", "So your older sister needs a whole damn month to feel special on her own, but your younger isn't allowed to feel as special?", "You shouldn't appoint yourself the arbiter of nonsense, but here we are.", "You\u2019re dead ass wrong and the entire internet things you\u2019re a fool sooooooo", "You're such a jealous little drama queen aren't you?", "It is kind of weird when I get to thinking about it. Like oh nooooo you can\u2019t be pregnant, not while I am! Ugh, how rude! \n\nWe should just be happy and supportive of each other when it comes to pregnancy anyways. It\u2019s not easy and we all hope for a healthy baby and mother.", "All three of my babies happened when I was not trying. So there\u2019s that.", "No worries, our thoughts in text don't always read as we think they do not \ud83d\ude0a", "Lol.  I have no idea how announcing a pregnancy a week after a completely different pregnancy announcement is even in the same ballpark as someone proposing at a wedding.", "My brother and I had got our SOs pregnant at the same time and we were both so happy for each other. Then my sister told us she was pregnant too and I was ecstatic. I still have a picture of us at a soccer game from the time we were all expecting a baby. Unfortunately my sister lost hers and she was devastated. But I still cherish that moment and that happiness I felt at that time.", "Attention is overrated. But I am an ultra introvert too so\u2026.", "If I lost a baby I wanted, even in the first few weeks, I would want my support network to be there for me, not keep it some deep dark secret that I have to grieve alone. Idk why or when it became wrong to want to let people know early on in the pregnancy, IF that is what the mother/parents want.", "I feel like 9 times out of 10, if someone doesn't like to share attention and/or uses phrases \"steal the spotlight,\" they're insufferably self centered. Like, get over yourself.", "Not only that but there is no reason they can\u2019t both be celebrated. If there must be \u201cspotlights\u201d on these things, you can\u2019t say one sister is the star of the show just because they appeared on stage first. They are equally important characters, shine two lights on the stage.", "Your parents were right to ream you out. YTA.", "It's so silly isn't it? My sister was 6 weeks pregnant when I gave birth and I was the only one outside of her husband who knew.\n\nShe was adamant about not telling our family until my son was about 2 months old because she didn't want to steal my thunder. \n\nMaybe I'm just not wired that way, but I was like, what thunder? Seriously, the more babies, the more joy, it really doesn't matter.\n\nOP is YTA and needs to stop making this about her when it has nothing to do with her.", "My pre-coffee brain misread your first sentence as \"my sister got pregnant on purpose right after I did\" and was thinking she must have the most incredible power to have somehow willed her baby into being.\n\nI love how close your kids are!", "I feel like there\u2019s absolutely a way for people to have kids around the same time or on the same date (or both in your case!) and make it a special thing and give the cousins a wonderfully bond as they grow up together. I love that your family grew closer as a result of it!", "Not to mention stressing a pregnant woman out needlessly, especially in her first trimester.", "My identical twin adopted daughters were pregnant at the EXACT SAME TIME. To the day. One with identical twin girls and one with a boy. The entire family could not have been more thrilled. I almost passed out when they told me. \ud83d\ude02", "And that was absolutely the right way to do it!", "My older brother was born on march 18th and I March 30th. When my mom was pregnant with our younger brother my older brother told her \"don't have that baby on my birthday!\" My mom laughed and jokingly told him not to worry that she would have the baby on my birthday instead. Guess who got her first birthday crashed by the newest sibling? It's a running joke in my family. What's  even funnier is when I was 23 I actually ended up having one of my sons on my birthday and my mom had previously joked about my own baby crashing my birthday.", "OMG YTA how dare you get born on your cousin's important birthday party clearly you are  a narcissist she should go NC immediately etc etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/S OBV", "I am laughing so much at the\n\n>Oh no.....the cousins....will be close in age....a tragedy.....\n\nI replied to a comment welago about me and my only sister being pregnant at the same time, I kept it from my sis because she moved to a different country and wanted to surprise her. I lost my baby before I got to visit her. Since then I lost my 2nd baby, but when she got pregnant on her 2nd, I got pregnant on my 3rd, only a few months between them. She got pregnant on her 3rd, I pregnant on my 4th, again only a few months between them. You best believe all our 5 kids are best friends.\n\nBut funnily enough, her middle child and my youngest are two peas in a pod. My eldest and her youngest are two peas in a pod. And her oldest (my godchild) and me (who lost my girl while I was pregnant) are two peas in a pod. And basically my sister has 6 kids right now. We loved having our kids so close together. And I love how close the oldest is to me without the oldest knowing even now how much he helps me get through my dark days even well over a decade later.", "Thank you for spelling this out. I was trying to figure out why it was no big deal at all when multiple family members announced pregnancies at the same time. It's not like we're having kids for the attention (that would backfire!) and we were happy for each other. Also, when people get married, they are often paying a lot of money for the attention to be on them. I blurted out my pregnancy news at a family barbecue and if anyone was offended, they didn't say so. We're still all best friends so I'm going to assume it was fine.", "Wow, that is actually wild! To the day?! Seriously, statistically, that are the odds?! What a blessing.", "Lol I somehow managed to have both of my boys on their due dates, and my youngest has the same birth stats as my sister's oldest \ud83d\ude02", "That is hilariously awesome.", "Aw, I'm so glad you've got family like that! It's wonderful, isn't it?\n\nWe've 12 kids between my siblings so far, from 10 to the one due in June, and seeing them all together is just the best. I'm infinitely grateful to my sisters for being there for me through pregnancy, birth, & parenting. If one of them was like \"you can't be pregnant while our other sister is pregnant\" it would've felt horrible. As it stands I'm actually pretty certain I'll end up pregnant at the same time as our youngest sister at some point and I can't wait!!!"]}
