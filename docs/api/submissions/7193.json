You cant cook and don\u2019t work. You are just expensive and a waste of money. I am worth way more than you.\n\nI was in rage and it was not nice but I couldn\u2019t control it.

It's bizarre that your mom thought that meant you'd pay for your sister to move out. I have bipolar disorder,and go thru depressions and mania,but I've always held a job. I was on FMLA for a little bit,but I still worked. Your sister can work to support herself, or your parents can continue babying her and be responsible for her.

If parents coddle but kids see others making their own way and the freedom of choice and flexibility that comes with it, they often want that.

OP obviously have dealt with this for a long time and lashed out. Don't think they are an asshole for it.", "Yeah, agreed. OP is leaving out a lot of info. \nMaybe the sister is truely debilitated by her diagnosis and the parents are too, since they now have a child who may never achieve independence, it\u2019s a huge burden. \n\nI think OP needs to take care of themselves but also practice compassion for her Sis and parents. I can see why OP feels hard done by, especially when they have picked up all the extra chores and unfair amount of blame. But this stuff happens in families, it\u2019s rarely fair particularly when someone in the family has special needs. \n\nOP, move out.

If you need to open a new bank account to do this, consider using a different bank to your current one so their access doesn't get carried over to your new account.", "Talk the the bank. Explain you have family that may try to access the account and ask to set up a password and additional protections.\n\nI had to do this after my mom forged my signature to empty my bank account. Yes I regret not going to the police but I was op's age and scared.", "My first thought too. Keep your money safe OP!", "The school hours and the use of the term \"bio-shop\" suggest France to me. The pets - rural France maybe? There's places in rural France where houses are pretty cheap if you have the deposit, although I'm assuming the mortgage would have to be in the parents name.\n\nAlso - as you say - NTA and holy crap.", "Sister needed to hear it, it's not like she didn't take advantage of being the golden child. Breaking OPs stuff and letting her take the blame. If she's older she should know that it's unfair.", "When I was at university my hours were basically 9-5 (except we had Wednesday afternoons off), then there was studying and coursework to do on top of that. God I wish it had only been 15 hours per week!", "There are countries other than US with different sylabus and timetable.", "This is the answer. Who the crap hears their child got a job and sees dollar signs?\n\nI know in some households kids choose to work to help cover their own expenses and choose to send money to parents even after moving out. That is not this.\n\nIf op's in non_compulsory school she shoukd consider doing a semester off and working as full time as possible, maybe couch surf until she can get a place.", "France has longer lunch breaks than 20 min, so some kids even go home to eat.", "ESH, which will probably get me downvotes, but.\n\n1-) Your parents, most of all, the biggest assholes for the whole golden child dynamic that created resentment between you two and made your sister grow up the way she did.\n\n2-) In that situation, it doesn't seem like your sister even did anything wrong? It was your mother saying all that shit, so why are you taking your anger out on your sister? \n\n3-) Sorry, while I understand you reached a limit, telling someone they're worthless is a hard no, a hard asshole behaviour, since, as mentioned above, the sister didn't even say or do anything in that moment to deserve that? \n\nHonestly, from your story it doesn't even seem like she did all that much to antagonise you, other than little obnoxious things you could expect from teenagers. The fact that she wasn't punished correctly for them wasn't exactly her fault either... but again, your parents. Why does it seem like you hate your sister more than your parents, who are ACTUALLY responsible?", "NTA. Your mom is major T A. Make sure they don\u2019t have access to your account.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m about 25-30 years, your parents will call you begging to help your sister because they\u2019ll be financially drained.\n\nKeep your bank account private, and make sure you have your personal documents. If your parents and your sister threaten to take your money, then be prepared to call the police. \n\nGood luck with everything!", "Nta\nWalk away op.. Nc or lc for your own mental health.", "NTA\n\nShe, and your parents, needed to hear it.", "NTA your mothers logic is strange - that you should work to support the sister?  that's a reason NOT to work!\n\nOf course they want you to stay behind and do all the chores (perhaps visit the sister during the week to do her cooking / cleaning etc.)\n\nYour parents have created a dynamic where it pays your sister to be lazy.  Unfortunately you will have to leave asap because the sister is always going to be a drain on your life", "NTA, and be ready to move out, get your personal documents, birth certificate etc and keep them some place secured. I am sure your parents will not want to free you.", "NTA. You've got a plan, stick to it. Family is important, but people that treat you like this are family in name only. Getting away from them is unquestionably the right decision.", "What relationship is there to reconcile? She's basically a live in maid at this point.", "Calling someone worthless is not standing up for herself, it's being an asshole. She attacked the wrong person. She should be angry at her parents, since they're the ones who created the whole situation and made her childhood shit.", "How is this necessary? It would be super illegal for a bank to give info or access to anyone but the verified owner of the account. I've seen this advise a lot here and it really baffles me. Is it normal for banks to blatantly break the law in the US?", "In most US states a parent has to be a co-owner of any bank accounts of a minor.  So they also have complete access", "I live in Europe and work with banking system, and I can be mistaken, but for what I  know, banking system in the US is pretty much outdated, comparing to the EU. There are a lot of small banks with old fashioned \"personal\" approach, meaning parents/family can claim access to other person account without proper power of attorney and on discretion of a teller, it can be granted. In my country, e.g., I can't present a bank with just a letter to get access to my husband's bank account, it should be a power of attorney certified by a notary.", "Here a parent will usually be able to see the kid's account but not access it."]}
