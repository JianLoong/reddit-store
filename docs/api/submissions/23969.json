Massive YTA. Your sister is right, you ARE an AH and a coward. \n\nYou could have just told your gf that you\u2019d like a night out, just the two of you. But noooo. You had to make her believe that her daughter wasn\u2019t allowed to go. \n\nOF COURSE her three year old goes everywhere with her!! What did you think would happen, dating a mom? \n\nI hope she dumps you.", "YTA, and I agree with your sister, a total coward. You could have just said \u201cI\u2019d really like a special night alone with just us two, do you think your Mom could watch your daughter for the night so we can connect?\u201d But instead you lied and manipulated. How did you think you wouldn\u2019t get caught in that lie?", "YTA and am shocked you wrote this entire post and nowhere along the way did you realize you were an AH. Shocking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know what would have been the easy adult thing to do? Tell your girlfriend that you wanted an evening with just the two of you, while at your sister's wedding. I'm sure she would have understood and had her mom watch her daughter. That would have just made the most sense...instead of lying.\n\nYour sister has every right to be mad. It doesn't matter that you didn't flat out say it was child free for your girlfriend and that it was your sister's rule. It's the fact you used your sister's wedding as an excuse to not include your girlfriend's daughter when it's obviously not a child free event. It created an uncomfortable interaction between the two of them in the washroom.\n\nAlso makes perfect sense your girlfriend is pissed at you. You lied to her face instead of having an adult conversation. On top of that, I guarantee you that this will cause her to come to the conclusion that you do not want her daughter around, which you've already said is the case. Do not EVER date single mothers if you don't plan to step up to the role of being involved with the kid. Don't ever complain when a THREE YEAR OLD is the priority. If anything, you should be happy that you're dating someone who understands that being a parent comes FIRST at that kid's age. Go date a childfree woman because you clearly feel like you're competing with a 3 year old child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she takes her EVERYWHERE\n\nOF COURSE SHE DOES, her kid is THREE. JFC.", "YTA\n\nYes, your girlfriend jumped to the obvious conclusion that you'd been told the wedding was childfree to exclude her daughter, and went to your sister about it. How exactly else did you think this was going to end up?\n\nSo now you've got a justifiably pissed off sister who had to handle YOUR mess on her wedding day, and a gf who has learned you lie to her.", "I don\u2019t think you have a GF anymore. YTA", "YTA - you lied for no reason and we\u2019re easily found out. This is a situation entirely of your own making.", "YTA. If you want to play childish games of lying instead communicating like an adult then expect to be treated like one. And btw:\n\n*\"my girlfriend has a kid, a little girl who\u2019s 3yo and she takes her EVERYWHERE\"*\n\n*\"At the wedding, there was obviously children, a detail I\u2019d forgotten\"*\n\nWow...between this and the fact that you felt the need to ask if you were the AH on Reddit makes me think your bulb is a bit dimmer than average.", "YTA. \n\nI understand you wanted to spend time with your girlfriend alone \u2014 but instead of just communicating that to her you fabricated an entire lie that backfired in your face.", "YTA\nCommunication is key, if you want some alone time with your girlfriend tell her.\nWhat you did was really an a*hole move, you demonstrate that you are a selfish liar", "YTA. You done fucked up right good there buddy.

You threw blame and avoided a mature conversation with the person you are dating.  What you did was super hurtful and not the way to go about dealing with an issue that you are having.  Honestly, don\u2019t expect her to come back.", "YTA. And she left you, dude. She's not your girlfriend anymore.", "I found a typo. This should read, \u201cmy ex girlfriend.\u201d\n\nAlso, YTA for lying, and since you played with fire, you got burned.", "YTA She is right that you are a coward. Obviously when you date a woman with a three year old daughter you are going to have limited private time. That is common sense. If you feel like you need more, pull on your big boy pants and have a conversation. You chose to lie rather than talk to her so of course she doesn\u2019t have time for that bullshit. You also threw your sister under the bus so I completely understand why she is angry with you.", "YTA. Not only did you lie you put your sister in a terrible place.", "My sister is also not talking to me anymore because she thinks I \"threw her under the bus\" even though I never told my girlfriend it was my sister\u2019s idea \n\nYTA  Come on,,who else would choose  child free except bride  and groom\n\nAsshole", "You lied. YTA.", "YTA - Why didnt you just talk to your gf about having a night just the two of you? So instead of being an adult about it, you lie to her and wonder why she is upset with you??", "YTA date something without kids my guy", "YTA..seriously\u2026you couldn\u2019t just say, let\u2019s have a nice evening with my family and have some adult time and conversation at an adult event\u2026can you ask your mom if she can watch the little one?  That\u2019s not that hard. How could you be so dumb to think that she would not see other kids there?", "YTA. All you had to do was tell your GF you wanted an evening alone & instead of being open you lied. Your sister & GF are right.", "YTA\n\nYou were cowardly and dumb. She was definitely going to find out you lied. Next relationship try honest communication instead of lying.", "Good thing she left cause all that counts is her daughter. I get how absorbed she is with her child and can\u2019t be part of your life at the same time. Good luck", "YTA What a jerk.", "Dude. YTA. Be so serious.", ">Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my girlfriend\u2019s daughter, but it gets exhausting to never have moments between just me and my girlfriend\n\nCongrats, you don't have to worry about the kid cramping your life anymore!\n\nYou don't love any of the females in your life do you?\n\n\\- hated the kid being around in her MOM'S life\n\n\\- hated your gf for taking care of her YOUNG child but too cowardly to say it\n\n\\- didn't care about your sister enough to care about whether you'd mess up her day at her wedding.\n\nYTA Glad she knows her worth!!", "YTA but what bothers me more is the stupidity of it.  My dude, what did you expect to happen?  Did you really not think this through?  No plan for what you'd say?  I mean, C'mon.  This is bush league.", "Fastest YTA I've typed in a while.", "YTA. You're also single now.  Also a coward and a liar.  I'm certain your EX can do much better than you.", "YTA For lying, for one, and showing you have zero respect for your (hopefully ex-) girfriend. You're also an asshole for being in a relationship with a mother when you clearly don't want to be a father and don't even understand that children are not accessories or pets. WTF, \"she takes her EVERYWHERE\", like that's not what you're *supposed to do* with your young child. \n\nYou're also *super* terrible at critical thinking - wtf did you think would happen when she got to the wedding and there were children there? You sound like a 15 year old, not a grown ass adult.", "YTA why were you dating this woman, wasting her time and setting both her and her daughter up for pain? Being a parent means there is a kid around near constantly and they always come first. Dating a parent means you aren\u2019t just waiting for the times when the kid isn\u2019t there to enjoy yourself, it means joining a family where again, the kid always comes first. That you would lie over this is pretty concerning. One, it shows your dishonesty.  Who wants to date a liar? Two, it shows your manipulative and selfish nature. Rather than have a discussion and come to an agreement, you did whatever you had to and justified it because it got you the result you wanted. As if that is all that mattered. And finally, you showed that you aren\u2019t committed to that little girl. So yeah, I\u2019m not surprised she was gone.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve just told her you wanted to spend time with her alone. Instead you lied to her so you can get rid of the person she loves most in the world (that\u2019s not you)", "Hahaha yeah YTA. You can't accept the baggage and then complain about what it is after. You're dating a single-mom. You either need to get real okay with the idea that you're working toward being a family or you need to leave.", "YTA for lying, ya deceitful git.", "Yeah, YTA big time, and not a very bright one.\n\nIn what world did you think you would not be found out when other kids turned up at the wedding?\n\nWay to alienate your girlfriend and your sister in one go.", "YTA easy. You lied. You implied your sister made the rule. You shouldn't date someone with children because you are not mature enough for that right now.", "You, uh, you don't have a girlfriend.

The message she got was that you would be happier if she didn\u2019t have a child. You left her with a choice, her child or you. She chose correctly.\n\nYour relationship is over. You need to learn from this. You have to use your words and communicate how your feeling. When you lie the message you send is entirely different and it blows things up. Apologize to your sister and own up to being TA. You burned a lot of bridges with that lie.

That's exactly what you were thinking. Or maybe you weren't thinking at all.\n\nYou are completely justified in wanting to have a couple's night without your girlfriend's daughter. But you do that by having a conversation about it, not by lying about it. And if she won't have an occasional couples' night with you, well, then you have some decisions to make. Your GF may be being unreasonable by insisting her daughter is always included. But having kids around all the time is kind of what you sign up for when you date a person with young kids.\n\nYou handled this in the worst way possible and then are apparently stunned that it blew up in your face.

When your girlfriend dumps you please don't date another mom.", "Wtf? Don't date people with kids if you have to stir up a stupid lie amongst multiple ppl for alone time.

They communicate and make sure everyone is on the same page.\n\nAlso, the event itself is probably a factor. If I had a little kid and I was dating a guy and went to his *sister's* wedding with him, and he lied to specifically exclude my kid - that's a family event.
