Nope nope nope. Some extreme maternal gatekeeping right here", "NTA \n\nThis is a totally valid issue. Your wife is undermining your ability to form that stable bond with your daughter by not allowing you to learn how to comfort her in those moments, and not allowing her to learn to be comforted by you. \n\nI get that it is genuinely really hard to hear a child cry when you know you can step in and make it stop. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the wrong thing to do. This isn\u2019t leaving a poor baby to sob alone, unconsoled. You are with your daughter, you are there to comfort her, and you are more than capable of doing so. \n\nAs a nanny, I would highly recommend professional counseling to help you guys through this. You\u2019ll find a parenting system and distribution of labor that works for you, but it sounds like your wife in particular might benefit from the extra support.", "NTA. Your wife is the asshole. She\u2019s preventing your daughter from learning you can console her too.", "NTA! Your wife is preventing you from parenting your own child. That is not acceptable.", "NTA\n\nI fell into this same pattern as your wife without realizing it. For the same reason as her. My partner had to sit down and talk to me about it and tell me I was dismissing and disrespecting his role as a parent. I absolutely was. Not intentionally but it still hurt him the same. Thankfully we were able to correct it fairly quickly. \n\nYour wife needs to understand you're both parents and PARTNERS. Your kid should feel safe and comforted by both.", "NTA, it really is a problem. When she swoops in \"do you need mama?\" Be matter of fact and tell hey \"No, dad has it under control.\" Though unfortunately I think it may be too late for this approach.  Good luck, gonna be a difficult 17 years if this is any indication.", "Dad here. NTA. I was in the same situation. You must put your foot down. When you are handling it, your wife stays out. If the child is asking for mommy, you can tell her mommy is busy right now. Your wife needs to respect it, or she will be unable to rely on you in the future.", "NTA. I had the same reaction as your wife for a long time because my son crying caused me physical pain. But my husband and I talked it out after a few arguments over it and I realized I was undermining his ability to parent. There are times when our son still wants nothing to do with my husband when he is upset but now there are also times my son wants nothing to do with me and only wants his dad. Your wife is headed for emotional burnout at some point. That's the point I got to and it wasnt pretty. We all suffered at that point.", "This kind of happened with me and my wife. Although our communication was much more productive it sounds. We eventually agreed on her asking me if I needed help, instead of swooping in and taking over, but we were both open and vulnerable with each other. It did help.  Regardless NTA", "NTA.", "Nta-your wife is missing the opportunity to teach your child multiple ways to soothe herself. What happens when Mom is not around? Better yet, start to teach her to soothe herself!", "[removed]", "NTA. You need to communicate with your wife very clearly that you're her parent just as much as her. She carries misconceptions regarding marital roles and acts according to what she knows. I think an open, calm conversation about how you expect her to react or how you divide the responsibilities regarding your little one is really important. I think it's a great thing you want to be an actual parent and not \"babysit\" like a lot of people jokingly refer to fatherhood - that's how it should be. It's your right and your duty and she needs to let you do it.", "NTA - your wife needs to let you have bonding time", "NTA, but your four month old hasn't learned anything like what you're inferring, she's not capable of that yet. Hope y'all can move past this, parenting style is a sensitive topic and being on the same page is crucial.", "NAH; she's basically acting on pure instinct and it's *really* hard to see your baby cry. (Of course you feel that too.) But she absolutely needs to let you parent your child. \n\nI think for now, your discussion should focus on how she takes the baby from you. Tell her that when you are comforting the baby, your wife needs to give you a chance to do it. You aren't \"standing by and letting her cry.\" You're doing what you're supposed to do.", "NAH, she\u2019s giving in to her instincts which is understandable but you\u2019re absolutely right. it\u2019s not fair to you or your child.", "NAH I feel like this was just a miscommunication, tell your wife that sometimes you don't need her help with your daughter, and if you needed help you would ask tell her you are perfectly capable of comforting your child. she clearly just wants to help and doesn't realize how its affecting  you and your daughters relationship.", "YTA.
