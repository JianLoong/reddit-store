Nope nope nope. Some extreme maternal gatekeeping right here", "NTA \n\nThis is a totally valid issue. Your wife is undermining your ability to form that stable bond with your daughter by not allowing you to learn how to comfort her in those moments, and not allowing her to learn to be comforted by you. \n\nI get that it is genuinely really hard to hear a child cry when you know you can step in and make it stop. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the wrong thing to do. This isn\u2019t leaving a poor baby to sob alone, unconsoled. You are with your daughter, you are there to comfort her, and you are more than capable of doing so. \n\nAs a nanny, I would highly recommend professional counseling to help you guys through this. You\u2019ll find a parenting system and distribution of labor that works for you, but it sounds like your wife in particular might benefit from the extra support.", "NTA. Your wife is the asshole. She\u2019s preventing your daughter from learning you can console her too.", "NTA! Your wife is preventing you from parenting your own child. That is not acceptable.", "NTA\n\nI fell into this same pattern as your wife without realizing it. For the same reason as her. My partner had to sit down and talk to me about it and tell me I was dismissing and disrespecting his role as a parent. I absolutely was. Not intentionally but it still hurt him the same. Thankfully we were able to correct it fairly quickly. \n\nYour wife needs to understand you're both parents and PARTNERS. Your kid should feel safe and comforted by both.", "NTA, it really is a problem. When she swoops in \"do you need mama?\" Be matter of fact and tell hey \"No, dad has it under control.\" Though unfortunately I think it may be too late for this approach.  Good luck, gonna be a difficult 17 years if this is any indication.", "Dad here. NTA. I was in the same situation. You must put your foot down. When you are handling it, your wife stays out. If the child is asking for mommy, you can tell her mommy is busy right now. Your wife needs to respect it, or she will be unable to rely on you in the future.", "NTA. I had the same reaction as your wife for a long time because my son crying caused me physical pain. But my husband and I talked it out after a few arguments over it and I realized I was undermining his ability to parent. There are times when our son still wants nothing to do with my husband when he is upset but now there are also times my son wants nothing to do with me and only wants his dad. Your wife is headed for emotional burnout at some point. That's the point I got to and it wasnt pretty. We all suffered at that point.", "This kind of happened with me and my wife. Although our communication was much more productive it sounds. We eventually agreed on her asking me if I needed help, instead of swooping in and taking over, but we were both open and vulnerable with each other. It did help.  Regardless NTA", "NTA.", "Nta-your wife is missing the opportunity to teach your child multiple ways to soothe herself. What happens when Mom is not around? Better yet, start to teach her to soothe herself!", "[removed]", "NTA. You need to communicate with your wife very clearly that you're her parent just as much as her. She carries misconceptions regarding marital roles and acts according to what she knows. I think an open, calm conversation about how you expect her to react or how you divide the responsibilities regarding your little one is really important. I think it's a great thing you want to be an actual parent and not \"babysit\" like a lot of people jokingly refer to fatherhood - that's how it should be. It's your right and your duty and she needs to let you do it.", "NTA - your wife needs to let you have bonding time", "NTA, but your four month old hasn't learned anything like what you're inferring, she's not capable of that yet. Hope y'all can move past this, parenting style is a sensitive topic and being on the same page is crucial.", "NAH; she's basically acting on pure instinct and it's *really* hard to see your baby cry. (Of course you feel that too.) But she absolutely needs to let you parent your child. \n\nI think for now, your discussion should focus on how she takes the baby from you. Tell her that when you are comforting the baby, your wife needs to give you a chance to do it. You aren't \"standing by and letting her cry.\" You're doing what you're supposed to do.", "NAH, she\u2019s giving in to her instincts which is understandable but you\u2019re absolutely right. it\u2019s not fair to you or your child.", "NAH I feel like this was just a miscommunication, tell your wife that sometimes you don't need her help with your daughter, and if you needed help you would ask tell her you are perfectly capable of comforting your child. she clearly just wants to help and doesn't realize how its affecting  you and your daughters relationship.", "YTA.

They should know by now to ignore some \"instincts\" when it isn't actually helpful.\n\nIf she was just doing it, had the discussion with him, and stooped... No problem. But since she argued with him that puts her in AH territory for me. She basically has said dad's have no place comforting children with her comments. That's fucked up in my opinion.", "BS\nThey had counseling about it and she is still doing it", "Sounds like the better question is what's the wife's problem with him.  He's trying to be a parent, and care for his child, but his wife just keeps pushing in out.", "Post counseling and this? Plan ahead, this seems like the fat lady is warming up her voice.", "More counseling seems needed... But I hope you know a good family lawyer...", "Tell her to back the fuck off or she is going to end up seeing her kid only half the time.", "I have a friend who did this. I think that she just liked being the hero mom who did it all and it also meant she was witness to a lot of firsts. What ended up happening was she had to do EVERYTHING. Their son would not approach Dad for anything. She did feeds, playtime, schoolwork, bath and bed and then complained that she got no help and may as well be a single parent. Its only from the age of 6 that he began developing a better bond with his dad but even then its one with some distance. He doesnt have an open rship with him where he can ask him anything. \n\nObviously this is extreme an example but your wife being the mother doesnt trump your place as father. NTA", "Aiii NAH\n\nShe's all conditioned by family and evolution and by the history of having a small, dependent newborn, to go charging in to rescue her baby. It can be incredibly hard to stay back and trust someone else. And of course you want to be involved and parent your daughter and comfort her when she's upset.\n\nSo I don't think there are any AHs here, just a situation you need to address together. Can you talk sometime calmly about how it makes you feel and maybe build up to her being more hands off? No interfering for 2 minutes, then no interfering for 3 minutes etc etc. \n\nIf your daughter won't settle with you yet, maybe start with shorter periods of time? But agree together on the aim.", "NTA. Might want to read up on attachment disorders because your daughter may end up having one. Your wife is setting your daughter up for some mental health issues in the future.", "NAH, just a bit of inexperienced parenting.\n\nOP, be careful. The message being sent is that every little incident, bump, scratch, fear, etc. needs mum and dad's attention. You need to promote some controlled crying to temper expectations. Also, just remember, parenting should be a united front between mum and dad, not a competition. If you compete, your kids will learn to pit you against each other.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA try doing the same thing for a day. Every time your kid cries and mum picks her up for a hug, walk up and pick her right out of your wives arms and say \"aw do you need dad\".  \n\nWell, actually, don't really do it, cause don't use your baby to get a point across, but do ask her how she would feel if you did do that. \n\nShe's undermining you as a parent and the kid is only a toddler. You need to have a serious conversation about this.", "NTA. I think you should arrange regular activities with just you and your daughter so you actually get time to bond with her without your wife interfering. It can be something like scheduled classes or just trips to the park/shop, but they need to be regular and for a prolonged period of time. Maybe it will help your wife get a life too.", "NTA. She is actively undermining your ability to soothe your daughter. Babies are exhausting, if she doesn't let you help she's going to burn herself out and more than likely resent you for not pitching in like you're trying to right now.", "ESH\nAfter reading you other posts (you know which ones) it\u2019s obvious you and your wife need to call it at day.

I felt like I\u2019m babes mom and at the time I spent the most time with him so I knew his needs better. My DH is very hands on dad and this pissed him off. He told me that I need to give him an opportunity to figure it out and learn babes cues. By running in every time babe cried I was teaching him that I was the only person that could soothe him and not his Dad. It wasn\u2019t easy but I had to check myself and back off. I\u2019m glad I did because my son has a beautiful relationship with his dad and he knows he can count on both of us. This is 100% a wife problem.", "NTA! She should love that you want to be there for your own child! Sit down and have a real discussion about your roles and what you want from being a parent. She can\u2019t keep you from it- does she want to be a single mum?!", "NTA  \n\n\nYour wife needs to find a way to have an open mind about your ability to nurture your daughter. Your daughter will be healthier and more emotionally stable if she gets a balance of parenting styles. The way men do parenting is just as valid and important as the way women do parenting, and kids do best when they have access to both.  \n\n\nStand up for your right to be an active participant in raising your daughter, and that includes being the one to hold her and offer her comfort and perspective when she takes a shock or a hurt. Your instincts are just as valid as your wife's, and your wife doesn't have the right to unilateral control over how your daughter is comforted.", "And mom is setting herself up for burnout. It's no fun down the road when mom is exhausted and no one else can console the child.", "They have discussed this and communicated it during marriage counseling, but wife still does it.", "As the mother of a child who only wants \u2018mama\u2019 and has been like that his entire 4 years of life no matter what we do, can confirm.", "Then she\u2019ll be upset that no one is helping with the child", "Hopefully once you split and have real quality time with your kid, she'll learn you're a good dad/support system/comfort source.", "This is parental alienation. My narc mom did this and ruined our relationship with him because of her selfishness. Maybe you should get counseling on your own for advice on how to deal with this since she refuses", "Then call her out on it.  Next time she has something planned leave the house shortly before she is set to go.  When she gets mad tell her she needs her mother and not you.  She wants to be the only one taking care of the child let her do it full bore for a few weeks.", "Not only that but OP wrote in a comment that this was already discussed when they had marriage counseling.", "He hasn't actually said whether he stops the kid crying or not. If she doesn't settle when he comforts her it might be hard for the wife to listen to the kid's distress. Doesn't mean they should continue this way, but it could be part of the conversation."]}
