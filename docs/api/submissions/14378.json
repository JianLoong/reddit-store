Nope nope nope. Some extreme maternal gatekeeping right here", "NTA \n\nThis is a totally valid issue. Your wife is undermining your ability to form that stable bond with your daughter by not allowing you to learn how to comfort her in those moments, and not allowing her to learn to be comforted by you. \n\nI get that it is genuinely really hard to hear a child cry when you know you can step in and make it stop. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the wrong thing to do. This isn\u2019t leaving a poor baby to sob alone, unconsoled. You are with your daughter, you are there to comfort her, and you are more than capable of doing so. \n\nAs a nanny, I would highly recommend professional counseling to help you guys through this. You\u2019ll find a parenting system and distribution of labor that works for you, but it sounds like your wife in particular might benefit from the extra support.", "NTA. Your wife is the asshole. She\u2019s preventing your daughter from learning you can console her too.", "NTA! Your wife is preventing you from parenting your own child. That is not acceptable.", "NTA\n\nI fell into this same pattern as your wife without realizing it. For the same reason as her. My partner had to sit down and talk to me about it and tell me I was dismissing and disrespecting his role as a parent. I absolutely was. Not intentionally but it still hurt him the same. Thankfully we were able to correct it fairly quickly. \n\nYour wife needs to understand you're both parents and PARTNERS. Your kid should feel safe and comforted by both.", "NTA, it really is a problem. When she swoops in \"do you need mama?\" Be matter of fact and tell hey \"No, dad has it under control.\" Though unfortunately I think it may be too late for this approach.  Good luck, gonna be a difficult 17 years if this is any indication.", "Dad here. NTA. I was in the same situation. You must put your foot down. When you are handling it, your wife stays out. If the child is asking for mommy, you can tell her mommy is busy right now. Your wife needs to respect it, or she will be unable to rely on you in the future.", "NTA. I had the same reaction as your wife for a long time because my son crying caused me physical pain. But my husband and I talked it out after a few arguments over it and I realized I was undermining his ability to parent. There are times when our son still wants nothing to do with my husband when he is upset but now there are also times my son wants nothing to do with me and only wants his dad. Your wife is headed for emotional burnout at some point. That's the point I got to and it wasnt pretty. We all suffered at that point.", "This kind of happened with me and my wife.

Better yet, start to teach her to soothe herself!", "[removed]", "NTA. You need to communicate with your wife very clearly that you're her parent just as much as her. She carries misconceptions regarding marital roles and acts according to what she knows. I think an open, calm conversation about how you expect her to react or how you divide the responsibilities regarding your little one is really important. I think it's a great thing you want to be an actual parent and not \"babysit\" like a lot of people jokingly refer to fatherhood - that's how it should be. It's your right and your duty and she needs to let you do it.", "NTA - your wife needs to let you have bonding time", "NTA, but your four month old hasn't learned anything like what you're inferring, she's not capable of that yet.

I think that she just liked being the hero mom who did it all and it also meant she was witness to a lot of firsts. What ended up happening was she had to do EVERYTHING. Their son would not approach Dad for anything. She did feeds, playtime, schoolwork, bath and bed and then complained that she got no help and may as well be a single parent. Its only from the age of 6 that he began developing a better bond with his dad but even then its one with some distance.

NTA", "Aiii NAH\n\nShe's all conditioned by family and evolution and by the history of having a small, dependent newborn, to go charging in to rescue her baby. It can be incredibly hard to stay back and trust someone else. And of course you want to be involved and parent your daughter and comfort her when she's upset.\n\nSo I don't think there are any AHs here, just a situation you need to address together. Can you talk sometime calmly about how it makes you feel and maybe build up to her being more hands off? No interfering for 2 minutes, then no interfering for 3 minutes etc etc. \n\nIf your daughter won't settle with you yet, maybe start with shorter periods of time? But agree together on the aim.", "NTA. Might want to read up on attachment disorders because your daughter may end up having one. Your wife is setting your daughter up for some mental health issues in the future.", "NAH, just a bit of inexperienced parenting.\n\nOP, be careful. The message being sent is that every little incident, bump, scratch, fear, etc. needs mum and dad's attention. You need to promote some controlled crying to temper expectations. Also, just remember, parenting should be a united front between mum and dad, not a competition. If you compete, your kids will learn to pit you against each other.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA try doing the same thing for a day.

You need to have a serious conversation about this.", "NTA. I think you should arrange regular activities with just you and your daughter so you actually get time to bond with her without your wife interfering. It can be something like scheduled classes or just trips to the park/shop, but they need to be regular and for a prolonged period of time. Maybe it will help your wife get a life too.", "NTA.

I felt like I\u2019m babes mom and at the time I spent the most time with him so I knew his needs better. My DH is very hands on dad and this pissed him off. He told me that I need to give him an opportunity to figure it out and learn babes cues. By running in every time babe cried I was teaching him that I was the only person that could soothe him and not his Dad. It wasn\u2019t easy but I had to check myself and back off.

Your daughter will be healthier and more emotionally stable if she gets a balance of parenting styles. The way men do parenting is just as valid and important as the way women do parenting, and kids do best when they have access to both.  \n\n\nStand up for your right to be an active participant in raising your daughter, and that includes being the one to hold her and offer her comfort and perspective when she takes a shock or a hurt.
