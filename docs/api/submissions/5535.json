Invite your sister to join you. It\u2019s pretty incredible that anyone expects you to still interact at all with your other brother and your ex.", "NTA\n\nAnother one of those *so messed up family posts* that I have to wonder if it's even real.\n\nCheating with your sibling, marrying that sibling, and having that siblings child are each grounds for NC. Parents are just going to have to understand that they have a split family. It's like when the parents get divorced and you have to decide which family to spend holidays with. They are going to have to learn to alternate. Sounds like once the younger sister gets to choose where to go her parents are going to be off the list if the philandering brother is there.", "NTA. Oh I'm sure she loves you so fucking much that she started fucking your own BROTHER !!! The fucking arrogance of these people honestly your better off staying well away from that shit show", "NTA - I would disown my brother and never speak to him again, my parents would also understand that and not say shit to me.", "NTA. Blood does not make family. Love and support does. Your older brother sounds like the best family you've got, and you'll be with them for the holidays", "Absolutely NTA.  And so sorry.\n\nAnd wow, feels like there\u2019s a whole story here \ud83d\ude33\n\nYou should pick up your little sister to spend Xmas w you guys too. What assholes they are-the rest of your family.", "You are spending Xmas with family. Specifically the older brother who didn't bang your partner. NTA.", "NTA Spend the day how you like, fuck the rest. It sounds like you have a nice day planned with your older brother, stick to that.", "NTA.", "NTA. How is this even a question? Of course you don\u2019t want to be around those AH.", "NTA.  I'm a bit surprised that your brother SURVIVED that situation, actually.", "Hell no NTA. \n\nYour ex cheated on you with your BROTHER?! and he said you should be supportive?! \n\nMaybe he should have been supportive and not hooked up with your ex whilst she was still dating you! \n\nMay their Christmas Turkey burn.", "NTA. You should be putting yourself first here and spending Christmas with family who support and love you. Not backstabbing arrogant idiots. You can do something separate with your sister later this week to spend time with her!", "NTA,\n\nYour brother and parents are being beyond inconsiderate of you, and you deserve better OP.", "NTA", "Nta. That would be an awful way to spend Christmas. Your mum is correct that you should spend it with family.... enjoy your time at your brothers home as he obviously has your best interests at heart", "NTA", "Nta, sorry yo. Those first 3 sentences. What a trip, hell no. Hell no. Go hang out with the cool brother.", "NTA, your other brother is also family, you're already spending your Christmas with family whatever your mom says.", "NTA", "NTA. Family is subjunctive. I agree you should spend it with family but family does not sleep with the person you're with. Family does not force you to spend time with the ex who cheated on you. So they aren't family and you don't have to go", "NTA where was this family supports each other when he was having his way with your partner? Cut him off and ypu will be happier", "Tell your brother to ask again when he's single, after she cheats on him too.  NTA", "Nta. Doesn\u2019t sound like your brother supports you so it\u2019s rich he\u2019s demanding you support him. Go celebrate with people who care about you.

Your parents, brother and ex are despicable people. They think you should just get over the fact that your wife was doing your brother behind your back?  Your brother says she loves you? Now thats funny! What BULLSHIT! Why would any person want to spend one second with a family that had back-stabbed them. Tell your brother and ex where they can go (it's very hot there). Tell mom and dad that if they can't understand what your ex and brother did to you and how it hurt you so bad that you won't be able to see or talk to them anymore. Good luck and spend the day with your good brother and his family.", "NTA why would your parents feel like they have control over your feelings? Your ex is an adulterer your brother is an ass. If they want to accept and forgive him and her that is their business.", "NTA. Hope you are enjoying the time with your older brother, who sounds like a lot better family.", "I can only imagine it would be at least incredibly awkward. And now your brother that betrayed you and your mom that supported this wants you to pretend to sit down together and pretend to be one big happy family because it's Christmas? Nah.
