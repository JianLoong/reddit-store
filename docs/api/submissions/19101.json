You will not be losing anything, since there was nothing there to begin with. Go on and live your best life.", "NTA. Block their hypocritical a$$es. They couldn't be bothered with you growing up.

They don\u2019t get to suddenly grow and mature and decide they want to pursue a relationship, you are already 17 and grown, it\u2019s far too late for that.

Now as an adult I refuse to have anything to do with them.", "There\u2019s no indication they want to pursue a relationship with her. They just want to harass her and give her a hard time.

I do admit i was emotional but it was hard for me growing up with no one, my friends siblings acknowledge eachother but I didn\u2019t have that at all.

Simply wanting to know if they were doing well. I was truly alone, I want nothing to do with them now. + it\u2019s just hard having a good time with people who left me in the dark and I went through some rough times with no one.", "Hell, she said they didn't even acknowledge her, never mind \"build a relationship\". There are plenty of people who manage to have a sibling relationship with 5 year younger sibs when they were children, too bad OP's brothers chose not to.\n\n\"they didn't do anything that most 22-year-olds wouldn't do when they looked around and saw their high school age sibling at the same party.\"\n\nThey could have asked, but no, they made a whole lot of assumptions. They don't know OP, or her boyfriend, or the fact that her parents knew she was there. And as for talking to them \"about what kind of relationship you'd like to have with them going forward\" - they've rejected every appeal she's ever made. But for some reason they now want to tell her what to do? Telling strangers what to do is usually not a good idea.", "Then don\u2019t, block them and get some peace.

I never got it. As someone who still would have loved that older brother relationship? I say to maybe give it a shot. Meet in neutral territory, in public like a coffee shop, but make sure you only text them first. Don\u2019t give them the chance to yell and overwhelm you. And make sure you stake a friend there to arrive separately, and before you so that they can buy you an out should your brothers start getting mouthy. But if you want that relationship with them, and you want to earnestly give them a chance to be big brothers and be their friend/younger sister? Open the conversation. Start it like this.\nYou: I understand you want to talk, that\u2019s fine. But you need to realize that in my eyes you\u2019ve never taken a vested interest in me before now so it doesn\u2019t make sense that you\u2019re trying to stake a claim into whatever I do. I\u2019m willing to talk, and I\u2019d like to do it face to face, let\u2019s meet at ___local coffee place you\u2019re not too attached to in case this goes poorly___ when would be good for the both of you? The first time I\u2019ll come alone, but if this goes well a couple of times, I\u2019d love for you to meet my boyfriend. His name is ___, he\u2019s a great guy. \n\nI hope this helps, and goes well for you.", "NTA. Block them for now. They don\u2019t deserve your attention.", "They\u2019re likely just showing off in front of their friends to be seen as protective big brothers. However, the op doesn\u2019t have brothers.

Block them and if they do the same thing tellling you\u2019re calling the cops for harrassment.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. They have not been older brothers to you. They had no right to intervene. They are blowing up their phone because are they too guilty to admit and they are twins. It\u2019s easy to circle jerk and gaslight when there are two of them. One of my older cousins tried this on my younger cousins. They are still not close to this day. Your brothers just wanted to make a scene.", "Send them this link and block them. Little too late for them. Actions have consequences and you owe them nothing just because you share parents.", "NTA - They had no right to interfere without permission.  \n\n\nAlso, good on your BF for going with you to remove you from a bad situation.", "NTA - your brothers have showed how much they care and respect you. Years of neglect and no Communication? They have no ground to now expect you to care about their opinions", "NTA. They just want to control you.", "Block them on all devices and apps and live your life. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, at all. Though I\u2019m curious to understand their sudden interest in you. Have they matured over the past years and want a relationship? Were they actually looking out for you? Maybe you all need to sit down and have a serious chat. All the best!", "NTA. I blocked by brother because he\u2019s a racist, homophobic ass who also dumped his wife for being to old so he could move on to a fresh 18 year old. If they deserve it, they deserve it.", "NTA they don\u2019t get to pick and choose when to have a sibling relationship. It\u2019s seems like they only cared became they were considering what other people would think of them for letting thief little sister be there.", "I wish it\u2019s only because the brothers didn\u2019t realised how hurt you have been by them excluding you. By them wanting to talk, it seems to me, they do care to understand you. Maybe by explaining your side, they will want to change toward you. Up to you. \n\nI can\u2019t blame them for saying you are too young to drink, and not appropriate for an underage to attend a college party.\nThe old don\u2019t do as I did. However you are right saying they don\u2019t get to play big brothers with you when they checked out of your life. They can\u2019t have it both way. Stay safe.", "NTA.", "Mild YTA. I know I\u2019ll get downvoted but just hear me out. With the big age gap I don\u2019t blame them for not wanting their younger sister to tag along, like another commenter said, when they were 17 you were 12. I saw your response about not even acknowledging your existence, but with older siblings that\u2019s just the way it is when they think about their younger siblings. \n\nALSO based on your post, the only thing they asked your bf was his age and if he was going to be drinking and subsequently driving? That\u2019s a completely valid concern about underaged people at a party with alcohol. It doesn\u2019t seem, at least based on what was written, that they were trying to play \u201cbig brothers\u201d. Well, maybe a tiny bit, but now you\u2019re at an age where you\u2019re all essentially adults and they are finally on a level maturity ground. If they\u2019re finally ready to start developing a relationship what\u2019s the problem?  \n\nI only come at it from this perspective bc I have two siblings 8 and 10 years older than me and it took me until I was 17/18 to finally develop a relationship with them.", "ESH yeah your brothers shouldn\u2019t have ignored you for most of your childhood but drinking and driving is a legitimate concern. \n\nIf this is the US, you and your boyfriend are underage anyway. \n\nToo many people in my high school ended up dead at 17 with their cars bent around trees."]}
