I\u2019m awoken at 7:16 AM or so by Evie and she\u2019s telling me someone is knocking at the door. I hear it, and it\u2019s loud and consistent. I\u2019m thinking \u201cwho the hell is at our door at this hour?\u201d I open the door, I see an RA and two cops standing there. They ask me my name, I answer, and then they ask if Mason Richardson is my roommate, all in a hurried manner. I answer yes and tell them I\u2019ll get him. I tell him someone is at the door, and he gets dressed to go open it. He asks who it is and I shrug in an \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d way, mostly because I\u2019m still shocked seeing cops at my door at this hour. He took his precious time to open the door, though, and they were aggressively knocking on the door (I\u2019m thinking \u201cdude, can you hurry up?\u201d And \u201cwhat the hell is about to happen?!\u201d ). He opens the door, they exchange words and I hear \u201cmom\u201d somewhere in there. He eventually comes back in and asks \u201cwhy were you acting so scared when I asked who it was? You never seen cops before?\u201d I respond \u201cdude, I don\u2019t know\u201d because I\u2019m still trying to process all that just happened. Let me add that he also has two phones, so when I see cops, I\u2019m wondering if the reason he has them is going to come to light. Later that day, me and Evie are theorizing what the hell all of that hoopla was about, and we thought his Mom sent them because she was unable to contact him, then Evie says she saw him on the phone with him Mom *just last night*. She\u2019s somehow involved though because she came up, but we\u2019re just so confused. So today he brings it up, and he tells me he was upset about me saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as a response because it could\u2019ve been something much more serious, and that all the people he told agreed that it was \u201cfed\u201d behavior (which basically means a snitch or someone unloyal). \n\nAITA, Reddit?", "created_utc": 1697386373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178ir7c/aita_for_shrugging_i_dont_know_when_cops_came_to/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's no actual evidence of any wrongdoing, so stop jumping to conclusions.", "Of course YTA. Why wouldn\u2019t you give your roommate the heads up there were cops there for him? And even if you were confused at first, you said you were coherent enough to think that he was taking way too long to answer the door and being annoyed about it. Why not mention it at any point during the interval you wanted him to hurry? It is snitch behavior and it\u2019s also just weird.", "Sounds like you didn\u2019t want to give him a heads up.
