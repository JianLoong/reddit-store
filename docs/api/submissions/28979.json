They ask me my name, I answer, and then they ask if Mason Richardson is my roommate, all in a hurried manner. I answer yes and tell them I\u2019ll get him. I tell him someone is at the door, and he gets dressed to go open it. He asks who it is and I shrug in an \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d way, mostly because I\u2019m still shocked seeing cops at my door at this hour.

ANYONE else would warrant a description. \n\nSo your roommate safely assumed it was another student. So he did not rush and took his time getting to the door. \n\nThis meant that the cops would be getting more impatient, and if they thought he was a flight risk they could have barged in. Your LIE put him in danger. Your LIE could have made the cops think he was intentionally stalling (ie flushing evidence down the toilet). \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely an asshole for putting someone at risk for NO REASON.", "YTA. \nFirst, because you confirmed that he was there when the cops asked. \nSecond, because you didn\u2019t give him a warning.", ">He took his precious time to open the door, though, and they were aggressively knocking on the door (I\u2019m thinking \u201cdude, can you hurry up?\u201d And \u201cwhat the hell is about to happen?!\u201d ). He opens the door,\n\nWhy was the door ever shut after you opened it? You shut the door on these cops?? Didn't tell the roommate who it was so he felt no urgency to be quick. Yeah that doesn't look suspicious as fuck and likely to escalate the situation. They could have barged in and it would have been completely your fault", "To me one of the main reasons OP absolutely should have told the roommates is because OP actually made it clear that roommate was taking his time opening the door. That looks very suspicious to cops, had he known he likely would\u2019ve been quicker. \n\nHere\u2019s where I really think OP is the AH no matter what; even if he was groggy at first. When OP wrote this-\n\n\u201c [1]He took his precious time to open the door, though, and [2]they were aggressively knocking on the door [3] (I\u2019m thinking dude can you hurry up!\u2019 And \u201cWhat the hell is about to happen?!)\u201d \n\n[1] \u201cHe took his precious time to open the door\u201d\u2026\n      \n      Umm excuse me?! He\u2019s taking his precious time          because he\u2019s unaware that there\u2019s cops there! And you know this! \n\n[2] \u201cThey were aggressively knocking on the door\u201d \n       \n      So you still stood there knowing the cops where outside basically banging on the door and you still didn\u2019t tell him?\n\n[3] \u201c Im thinking dude hurry up! And What the hell is about to happen?!\u201d \n\n    So this line right here sealed it for me. OP actually had the time to think to himself and have the audacity to be like \u201cdude hurry up!\u201d Like really? Roommate had no idea who was at the door. He had no sense of emergency to hurry and open it. \n\nOP sat there and thought to themselves that roommate should hurry up, even though OP is aware that there\u2019s cops outside, he knows that RM doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s cops outside. \n\nIf OP could get annoyed enough to think to themselves to \u201churry up\u201d then they were absolutely coherent enough by that point to at least give the room mate a heads up just so RM knows he should probably be quicker. That\u2019s kind of a dick move on OPs part. \n\nAlso tbh I do actually kind of think that OP in a way did it on purpose even if he didn\u2019t realize in the moment. The reason I think that is OP mentioned RM having 2 cell phones and seemed to have already been curious what that was about anyways. He actually said something like \u201ci thought we would find out the reason why [ he had 2 phones]\u201d meaning he obviously thought there was a good chance it was maybe something shady. \n\nThen OP goes on to say him and GF basically speculated (gossip lol) later that day what it all was about, even though it\u2019s none of their business. So\nOP seems to maybe be the type to possibly not give a heads up in a situation like this because he wanted to know the outcome (because he was already curious and wondering why he had 2 phones). \n\nI bet you before this happened him and GF were already speculating about the phones (innocently of course but some people just are nosy and like drama) and when this happened even OP admitted he thought maybe something shady could happen.  \n\n Idk I\u2019m probably reading way to into things lol. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA", "YTA - sending him to the cops with no warning. You are a snitch", "YTA it\u2019s clear you wanted to part of this and wanted to spring the cops on him in case he did something illegal rather than tell him", "People who go around throwing the words fed or snitch around like that is usually always a fes or a snitch themselves. \n\nHonestly? I'd get a new roommate if you can.", "YTA and a liar and coward. If the cops showed up for you and he he lied to you, you\u2019d be upset too. Especially if he said the reason why he lied was because he was afraid you\u2019d cause a shootout. Grow up dude.", "It\u2019s pretty weird to shrug as if it\u2019s a random person when it was \u2018officials\u2019 even just the RA much less the police.  YTA for not passing on absolutely obvious information.  It could have been them coming to relay bad news but here you are so busy wondering g if he is a crook that you can\u2019t even respond like a reasonable person.  That\u2019s weird. \n\nAs for his mom, his being on the phone with her last night might have been his prof he wasn\u2019t somewhere else.", "YTA", "Of course YTA - way to tip your roommate off. You would snitch in a heartbreak", "NAH. \n\nBut if cops come looking for your roommate and you answer and they ask for him, saying:\n\n \"Hey dude, some cops are looking for you\" is a solid heads up, lol", "YTA\n\nDoesn't take that much brain power to say \"Police\".  Plus he said \"why were you acting so scared\".  So what was it.  You were looking scared or were you just waking up?\n\nPlus you were getting all snippy about him not hurrying up for the police..................but he doesn't know it's the police because you didn't tell him who it was.  So you're annoyed that he can't read your mind?  If something is pressing informing people why it's pressing usually helps instead of just being vaguely annoyed.\n\nDude, you knew it was the police and you didn't say it was the police.  You got caught in a lie.  Own up to it at least instead of all these little excuses.", "YTA", "Obviously YTA. You did know.", "YTA. I don't really understand why you didn't just say it was the cops. You said you were processing it, but I'm guessing you were aware they were cops right away, right? Like, how much processing do you need to identify them as police?\n\nIn any case, it doesn't seem like it was a choice you made, if it was indeed because you were processing. But then why are you asking if YTA? Very confusing.", "Even a narc would have said it was cop, YouAreTheAsshole.", "YTA. Glad you are not my roommate or friend. Wow can\u2019t even understand why you had to ask.  Is your judgement so clouded by natural assholism that you don\u2019t even what you did?

It isn't \"snitching\" on somebody just to say they're home. I could say more on that front, but I won't - I'd rather not be booted. I wonder, just for the sake of a societal basis and curiosity, how many of the voters here who think OP is TA are USian?\n\nOP had no idea what was going on, or whether his roomie had done anything at all, they might just have wanted him to tell him about an accident. He didn't tell them his roommate had done anything wrong, or anything else about where he'd been or whatever he might have done, except that yes, he was his roomie and he'd go get him, which is totally normal behaviour for someone who's just been woken up. I think the fearful stuff is just rationalisation in retrospect.\n\nIt also seems like a lot of you here don't get how long executive processing can take to kick in when you don't sleep like \"normal\" people. When I was OP's age, my sister would come have conversations with me in the middle of my sleep and I wouldn't even know I'd talked to her unless she told me, because my brain was on autopilot and totally checked out.", "YTA.

I won\u2019t say this is snitching, but it shows both a lack of courage and a lack of consideration.", "NTA you were only just awake", "NAH. If this was during normal hours and you were deliberately choosing to avoid Mason's question, then it would be Y T A. As it was, it sounds like you were groggy from sleep, hadn't processed what was happening, and so your \"I don't know\" was genuine as you were so confused about what was happening.

It was also 7 in the morning, you had no idea why they could\u2019ve been there, they weren\u2019t there for you, and you\u2019re half asleep. Roomie, however, heard continuous and aggressive knocking as he took his sweet time getting dressed, pretty unbothered, and was completely unruffled by cops being there, both before and after he knew why they were there. You froze, he did not, no reason to have hard feelings. \n\nI say your roommate seems kinda dim because he clearly has experience seeing cops, if he\u2019s so chill about it and commented on you never seeing cops. Also, literally no one who isn\u2019t either trying to act tough or has been exposed to some shit or both is going to say \u201cfed behavior\u201d, lol. My dad was a dealer when I was growing up and I knew good and damn well from a young age that if somebody started banging on the door, it was the cops or a even bigger problem. If he thinks he\u2019s the type of guy to be calling people snitches and saying \u201cfed behavior\u201d and commenting on people being scared of cops, he probably should brighten up enough to realize when somebody is continuously banging on your door without warning at some ungodly hour, it\u2019s probably the cops and you should probably get a move on. It\u2019s not YOUR fault he didn\u2019t make that connection, but wants to act like he\u2019s had experience with \u201cfeds\u201d. The Y T A judgements are totally neglecting how dumb you have to be to act like this roommate did when people are banging on your door after you\u2019ve been told they\u2019re here for YOU, especially when you talk like this about cops \u2620\ufe0f", "I see people writing about how one should get a chance to get themselves together before talking to cops, but in this case, it could've easily been your roommate who opened the door, and at 7AM, so he would still not have known who it was and been able to prepare himself...so that logic doesn't work for me personally...\n\nSo NTA imo.", "Nta sounds like he has a reason to be scared of snitches \ud83e\udd23", "NAH, as someone who has a slow wake up, i understand the feeling of not being able to be more specific than that, you had no bad intentions, just you were shocked/oblivious, so that doesn't makes you an ah", "NTA - sometimes your brain doesn't work when you've just woken up and all you can do is shrug your shoulders.", "Your reaction was somewhat odd but I fail to see why it was a big deal.   \nNTA", "NTA", "[deleted]", "YTA.

And What the hell is about to happen?!\u201d \n\n    So this line right here sealed it for me. OP actually had the time to think to himself and have the audacity to be like \u201cdude hurry up!\u201d Like really? Roommate had no idea who was at the door. He had no sense of emergency to hurry and open it. \n\nOP sat there and thought to themselves that roommate should hurry up, even though OP is aware that there\u2019s cops outside, he knows that RM doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s cops outside. \n\nIf OP could get annoyed enough to think to themselves to \u201churry up\u201d then they were absolutely coherent enough by that point to at least give the room mate a heads up just so RM knows he should probably be quicker. That\u2019s kind of a dick move on OPs part. \n\nAlso tbh I do actually kind of think that OP in a way did it on purpose even if he didn\u2019t realize in the moment. The reason I think that is OP mentioned RM having 2 cell phones and seemed to have already been curious what that was about anyways. He actually said something like \u201ci thought we would find out the reason why [ he had 2 phones]\u201d meaning he obviously thought there was a good chance it was maybe something shady. \n\nThen OP goes on to say him and GF basically speculated (gossip lol) later that day what it all was about, even though it\u2019s none of their business. So\nOP seems to maybe be the type to possibly not give a heads up in a situation like this because he wanted to know the outcome (because he was already curious and wondering why he had 2 phones). \n\nI bet you before this happened him and GF were already speculating about the phones (innocently of course but some people just are nosy and like drama) and when this happened even OP admitted he thought maybe something shady could happen.  \n\nIdk I\u2019m probably reading way to into things lol. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "> I can totally see how someone wouldn't have the mental capacity to process that all and form a coherent response.\n\nReally?
