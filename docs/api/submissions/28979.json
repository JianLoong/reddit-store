ANYONE else would warrant a description. \n\nSo your roommate safely assumed it was another student. So he did not rush and took his time getting to the door. \n\nThis meant that the cops would be getting more impatient, and if they thought he was a flight risk they could have barged in. Your LIE put him in danger. Your LIE could have made the cops think he was intentionally stalling (ie flushing evidence down the toilet). \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely an asshole for putting someone at risk for NO REASON.", "YTA. \nFirst, because you confirmed that he was there when the cops asked. \nSecond, because you didn\u2019t give him a warning.", ">He took his precious time to open the door, though, and they were aggressively knocking on the door (I\u2019m thinking \u201cdude, can you hurry up?\u201d And \u201cwhat the hell is about to happen?!\u201d ). He opens the door,\n\nWhy was the door ever shut after you opened it? You shut the door on these cops?? Didn't tell the roommate who it was so he felt no urgency to be quick. Yeah that doesn't look suspicious as fuck and likely to escalate the situation. They could have barged in and it would have been completely your fault", "To me one of the main reasons OP absolutely should have told the roommates is because OP actually made it clear that roommate was taking his time opening the door. That looks very suspicious to cops, had he known he likely would\u2019ve been quicker. \n\nHere\u2019s where I really think OP is the AH no matter what; even if he was groggy at first. When OP wrote this-\n\n\u201c [1]He took his precious time to open the door, though, and [2]they were aggressively knocking on the door [3] (I\u2019m thinking dude can you hurry up!\u2019 And \u201cWhat the hell is about to happen?!)\u201d \n\n[1] \u201cHe took his precious time to open the door\u201d\u2026\n      \n      Umm excuse me?! He\u2019s taking his precious time          because he\u2019s unaware that there\u2019s cops there! And you know this! \n\n[2] \u201cThey were aggressively knocking on the door\u201d \n       \n      So you still stood there knowing the cops where outside basically banging on the door and you still didn\u2019t tell him?\n\n[3] \u201c Im thinking dude hurry up! And What the hell is about to happen?!\u201d \n\n    So this line right here sealed it for me. OP actually had the time to think to himself and have the audacity to be like \u201cdude hurry up!\u201d Like really? Roommate had no idea who was at the door. He had no sense of emergency to hurry and open it. \n\nOP sat there and thought to themselves that roommate should hurry up, even though OP is aware that there\u2019s cops outside, he knows that RM doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s cops outside. \n\nIf OP could get annoyed enough to think to themselves to \u201churry up\u201d then they were absolutely coherent enough by that point to at least give the room mate a heads up just so RM knows he should probably be quicker. That\u2019s kind of a dick move on OPs part. \n\nAlso tbh I do actually kind of think that OP in a way did it on purpose even if he didn\u2019t realize in the moment. The reason I think that is OP mentioned RM having 2 cell phones and seemed to have already been curious what that was about anyways. He actually said something like \u201ci thought we would find out the reason why [ he had 2 phones]\u201d meaning he obviously thought there was a good chance it was maybe something shady. \n\nThen OP goes on to say him and GF basically speculated (gossip lol) later that day what it all was about, even though it\u2019s none of their business. So\nOP seems to maybe be the type to possibly not give a heads up in a situation like this because he wanted to know the outcome (because he was already curious and wondering why he had 2 phones). \n\nI bet you before this happened him and GF were already speculating about the phones (innocently of course but some people just are nosy and like drama) and when this happened even OP admitted he thought maybe something shady could happen.  \n\n Idk I\u2019m probably reading way to into things lol. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA", "YTA - sending him to the cops with no warning. You are a snitch", "YTA it\u2019s clear you wanted to part of this and wanted to spring the cops on him in case he did something illegal rather than tell him", "People who go around throwing the words fed or snitch around like that is usually always a fes or a snitch themselves. \n\nHonestly? I'd get a new roommate if you can.", "YTA and a liar and coward. If the cops showed up for you and he he lied to you, you\u2019d be upset too. Especially if he said the reason why he lied was because he was afraid you\u2019d cause a shootout.

YTA for not passing on absolutely obvious information.  It could have been them coming to relay bad news but here you are so busy wondering g if he is a crook that you can\u2019t even respond like a reasonable person.  That\u2019s weird. \n\nAs for his mom, his being on the phone with her last night might have been his prof he wasn\u2019t somewhere else.", "YTA", "Of course YTA - way to tip your roommate off. You would snitch in a heartbreak", "NAH. \n\nBut if cops come looking for your roommate and you answer and they ask for him, saying:\n\n \"Hey dude, some cops are looking for you\" is a solid heads up, lol", "YTA\n\nDoesn't take that much brain power to say \"Police\".  Plus he said \"why were you acting so scared\".  So what was it.  You were looking scared or were you just waking up?\n\nPlus you were getting all snippy about him not hurrying up for the police..................but he doesn't know it's the police because you didn't tell him who it was.  So you're annoyed that he can't read your mind?  If something is pressing informing people why it's pressing usually helps instead of just being vaguely annoyed.\n\nDude, you knew it was the police and you didn't say it was the police.  You got caught in a lie.  Own up to it at least instead of all these little excuses.", "YTA", "Obviously YTA. You did know.", "YTA. I don't really understand why you didn't just say it was the cops. You said you were processing it, but I'm guessing you were aware they were cops right away, right? Like, how much processing do you need to identify them as police?\n\nIn any case, it doesn't seem like it was a choice you made, if it was indeed because you were processing. But then why are you asking if YTA? Very confusing.", "Even a narc would have said it was cop, YouAreTheAsshole.", "YTA. Glad you are not my roommate or friend. Wow can\u2019t even understand why you had to ask.  Is your judgement so clouded by natural assholism that you don\u2019t even what you did?

It isn't \"snitching\" on somebody just to say they're home. I could say more on that front, but I won't - I'd rather not be booted. I wonder, just for the sake of a societal basis and curiosity, how many of the voters here who think OP is TA are USian?\n\nOP had no idea what was going on, or whether his roomie had done anything at all, they might just have wanted him to tell him about an accident. He didn't tell them his roommate had done anything wrong, or anything else about where he'd been or whatever he might have done, except that yes, he was his roomie and he'd go get him, which is totally normal behaviour for someone who's just been woken up. I think the fearful stuff is just rationalisation in retrospect.\n\nIt also seems like a lot of you here don't get how long executive processing can take to kick in when you don't sleep like \"normal\" people. When I was OP's age, my sister would come have conversations with me in the middle of my sleep and I wouldn't even know I'd talked to her unless she told me, because my brain was on autopilot and totally checked out.", "YTA.

If this was during normal hours and you were deliberately choosing to avoid Mason's question, then it would be Y T A. As it was, it sounds like you were groggy from sleep, hadn't processed what was happening, and so your \"I don't know\" was genuine as you were so confused about what was happening.

It was also 7 in the morning, you had no idea why they could\u2019ve been there, they weren\u2019t there for you, and you\u2019re half asleep. Roomie, however, heard continuous and aggressive knocking as he took his sweet time getting dressed, pretty unbothered, and was completely unruffled by cops being there, both before and after he knew why they were there. You froze, he did not, no reason to have hard feelings. \n\nI say your roommate seems kinda dim because he clearly has experience seeing cops, if he\u2019s so chill about it and commented on you never seeing cops. Also, literally no one who isn\u2019t either trying to act tough or has been exposed to some shit or both is going to say \u201cfed behavior\u201d, lol. My dad was a dealer when I was growing up and I knew good and damn well from a young age that if somebody started banging on the door, it was the cops or a even bigger problem. If he thinks he\u2019s the type of guy to be calling people snitches and saying \u201cfed behavior\u201d and commenting on people being scared of cops, he probably should brighten up enough to realize when somebody is continuously banging on your door without warning at some ungodly hour, it\u2019s probably the cops and you should probably get a move on. It\u2019s not YOUR fault he didn\u2019t make that connection, but wants to act like he\u2019s had experience with \u201cfeds\u201d.

And What the hell is about to happen?!\u201d \n\n    So this line right here sealed it for me. OP actually had the time to think to himself and have the audacity to be like \u201cdude hurry up!\u201d Like really? Roommate had no idea who was at the door. He had no sense of emergency to hurry and open it. \n\nOP sat there and thought to themselves that roommate should hurry up, even though OP is aware that there\u2019s cops outside, he knows that RM doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s cops outside. \n\nIf OP could get annoyed enough to think to themselves to \u201churry up\u201d then they were absolutely coherent enough by that point to at least give the room mate a heads up just so RM knows he should probably be quicker. That\u2019s kind of a dick move on OPs part. \n\nAlso tbh I do actually kind of think that OP in a way did it on purpose even if he didn\u2019t realize in the moment. The reason I think that is OP mentioned RM having 2 cell phones and seemed to have already been curious what that was about anyways. He actually said something like \u201ci thought we would find out the reason why [ he had 2 phones]\u201d meaning he obviously thought there was a good chance it was maybe something shady. \n\nThen OP goes on to say him and GF basically speculated (gossip lol) later that day what it all was about, even though it\u2019s none of their business. So\nOP seems to maybe be the type to possibly not give a heads up in a situation like this because he wanted to know the outcome (because he was already curious and wondering why he had 2 phones). \n\nI bet you before this happened him and GF were already speculating about the phones (innocently of course but some people just are nosy and like drama) and when this happened even OP admitted he thought maybe something shady could happen.  \n\nIdk I\u2019m probably reading way to into things lol. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "> I can totally see how someone wouldn't have the mental capacity to process that all and form a coherent response.\n\nReally?

Not a great look. Very bitchmade.", "howdy do family \ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13", "Putting lying in quotes doesn't change the fact that it was an actual outright lie. He knew who it was, he acted like he didn't. His brain supplied an answer to every other question so this whole to tired to think idea is blatently bullshit.", "Nah. He knew it was cops when he saw them. He has enough time to get annoyed they were taking so long. He could have said who it was that whole time. \n\nThey say in another comment they were afraid. Totally TA", "Apparently the single syllable \u201ccops\u201d is something that requires a person to \u201cfunction at 100%\u201d to utter, TIL", "No. Sorry, that's  bullshit.", "After you just answered the door to the cops, the answer should be the same and you know it.", "Nah. Like you said, you slammed the door when you didn't expect em.\n\nSo at least give dude a heads up. Doesn't matter what the roommate does.", "Which would be why you communicate with your roommate, jeeze how dense can you be?", "You're not very good at the defensive are you?", "Than congratulations you will probably get a shit load of money from the college. But it didn\u2019t so maybe lay off the weed if you get this paranoid", ">Let me add that he also has two phones, so when I see cops, I\u2019m wondering if the reason he has them is going to come to light.\n\nSo you don't think answering the door and telling police you'll get your roommate for them - **but not telling your roommate that cops wanted to talk to him and that you already told them he was there**  is in anyway the same as the Breonna Taylor situation? You now how this looks and you are grasping at straws - YTA. So busy making bad  assumptions about your roommate and trying to look like a drowsy bystander. By the way, that IS how Breonna Taylor was killed by the police. Barely awake and never knowing who was banging on her door or why. Don't use her name in your mess.", "OP says he was scared there was going to be a shootout \ud83d\ude44", "The solution is walk away from people who might be breaking the law.  Easy Pesy.", "We want him nearby but his crib cannot be next to our bed (not enough space there). Also I am affraid of cosleeping so since he was born his crib is at the end of our bed, so nearby our feet.", "that\u2019s so cute!", "Depends when you go to sleep. Some people work night shift and go to bed at 5am or 6am... you think they should be well rested at 7am? Wtf.\n\nAnd OP is young and a student and could have studied or been at a party the night before? Maybe he only had 2h sleep and was still hungover?\n\n\"What's normal to the spider is chaos for the fly.\" Don't project from yourself onto others. Your experience or lifestyle has zero say about OPs life.", "Just because you North Americans have classes at 7am doesn't mean the rest of us care to torture our kids that way. \ud83d\ude09 Here in the UK classes start at 8.50 earliest.", "People who are regularly awake at 7am are small minority. Students who are awake at 7am are a rounding error.", "A big sign of maturity and intelligence is learning that new/weird/normal to YOU doesn't make a thing new/weird/normal in general.", "And the question remains standing.", "You see something suspicious and instead of acting like a grown up and talking to your roomate about your concerns, you make stupid  assumptions. That\u2019s shitty.", "You did not see something suspicious.  It's completely normal.", "you mean, you see something completely normal, that you don't do or don't understand and you come up with reasons why it could be suspicious.  \n\ntheir is nothing inherently  suspicious about 2 phones.  your a gossip, thats all, even if the only person you have to gossip with is yourself.", "You saw something slightly outside of your limited experience and decided it's suspicious.", "Notice he tries to sound cool but opens with family instead of fam? Good job on the slang.\ud83d\ude02", "That's fair, just bc I'm going with what the post says that he shrugged out of shock doesn't technically mean it wasn't a lie-it just means it may not have been an intentional lie.", "I mean, none of that explains how it's snitch behavior if OP wasn't intentional about it. What does OP being scared matter? It just further explains why OP clammed up and couldn't find the words to explain.", "I\u2019m lucky that didn\u2019t potentially get me *shot* or have my home illegally invaded. Especially since they were looking for a shooter, and it\u2019s very easy to mix up apartment numbers in my complex. And the shooter happened to be the apartment right across from me.\n\nIt was the most stupid decision I could have absolutely made at that point, short of actively antagonizing them. I\u2019m lucky it was 3am and they recognized it was late and I was groggy.", "Wym", "Which the only proof of here was that his roommate had one more phone than op was comfortable with.\n\nYou are saying stupid things.", "lmfaoo whatever Why is everyone so stuck on time of day. it genuinely doesn't matter. I've had cops knock at 5am and been able to form words, but not to project onto OP the dumbass fly...\n\nOP was able to use his words when speaking with the cops but as soon as his roommate asked a question he completely lost the ability to form words? and his excuse oh it was 7am and the shock? wtf???  he lost the ability to speak within seconds??? couldn't even form ONE word... \n\nThe time and the shock didnt stop from sitting there admonishing his roommate for not hurrying, and sit there speculating about what sort of criminal his roomate is but yet he couldn't say one thing?\n\nThis was the EASIEST scenario. Roommate: whose at the door. Op: shrugs, \"the cops,\"\n\ndrunk frat boys who also just took molly couldve answered the question.  OP was able to have fully coherent thoughts like \"who the fuck is knocking on our door at this time,\" was able to establish the exact time of day,  could judge his roomates slow response so clearly  despite any lack of sleep, hangover or exhaustion, his brain was working and he had the ability to think critically but couldn't tell his roommate who was at the door???", "lmfaooo, that's what you took issue with. one example? I didn't say all classes for everyone began at 7, just that there are classes for some at 7, it wasn't even a generalization that everyone across the globe has class at 7am, it was just an acknowledgement that for many people the day starting at 7am isn't out of the norm but of course everyone has to be \"those North Americans think the world revolves around them,\" instead of it just being a simple observation that no matter where you live your day stating at 7am isn't exactly unheard of and that someone knocking at 7am while annoying a.f, and sure if you want to whinge about it it's understandable, \nbut not exactly out of the ordinary...\n\nMind you, OP clearly states he goes to uni in D.C... so America where classes can start at 7am, so exactly what is your point? The story is set in North America and you're upset I applied American norms to it????", "And what if I was wrong to ask, and he is into suspicious things? Now I\u2019m an accomplice for knowing what he\u2019s up to. Now I\u2019m risking jail time just because I wanted to ask a question", "It is not normal. I\u2019m betting most of the people you know don\u2019t have two phones", "Lol yeah . Only one kind of slang.\n\nFucking embarrassing.", "Family is a variant of the word fam, people say it all the time.

And jump to stupid conclusions like there is something dodgey about him having two phones.\n\nAnd not specifically to do with defensiveness but more examples of your dumb attitude. All you heard from them is \"mom\" and it didn't even cross your mind they were there because his mom is hurt. You just assumed she is the problem.\n\nWhat part of this situation do you actually think you handled correctly? Because there is nothing", "And the police showed up, and the roommates called OP a snitch.  It is not working, OP needs wo move out.", "You were stuck up on the time and said being incoherent at 7am is inexcusable. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n> Knocking at 7am while annoying A.F isn't exactly a huge deal either, had it been 5am I would've been like wtf... but so many working days commence at 7am, there are 7am classes... I would be irritated a.f but not confused like I woke up in an alternative universe and unable to form words. geez\n\nAnd OP says he couldn't find the right words, and you assume he lies? Because YOU of course would be wide awake and would say \"cops\".\n\nOP did make a different comment that might assume he lied about not being able to form the words... and shows he's likely paranoid. So yeah he might be the AH. Doesn't change your response about *it's 7am and everyone can be awake/ coherent\" at that time because I can* is bullshit.", "That\u2019s literally not how that works. You really need to grow up.", "I think this is the comment that is to far. You were a good troll, but nobody is this stupid. Believability is gone", "I'm better most people you know do not have blonde hair. That doesn't make being blonde uncommon enough to not be normal", "I have a work and personal phone, lots of other people do as well.", ">Because that was the reason they said they didn't tell them?\n\nI'm going by what was said in the post-OP said he shrugged bc he was mostly shocked, which seems reasonable to me. If there's more or different info in the comments, I'm unaware of that at the moment.", "Considering it sounds like his mother called them, fleeing would have been the worst decision lmao", "So I had a roommate have cops show up to tell them their brother died. Should I have lied about it and moved out?\n\nNo cause that is ridiculous.  Op needs to apologize. If he has to move after every time they make a bad decision,  they might as well pack up a bindle and head to the tracks."]}
