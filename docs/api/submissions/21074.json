My family enabling her through cleched teeth and \"forgiveness cuz they are family!!\" doesn't fly with me. \n\nIn the 18 years she's been married to OP's son I'm curious to know how many times OP kept his mouth shut for the greater good because u can't tell me he has this opinion  of her because she's been a bowl full of sunshine for the last 18 years. How many ugly things has come out of her mouth up until this point that OP finally feeling just a bit of relief to have some \"daughter\" like sunshine in his life prob just slipped out BECAUSE of the relief he doesn't have to put up with 2 AH DIL's. \n\nI dunno OP, ur the AH in THIS situation for letting ur feelings slip out in front of EVERYONE.

Especially if she's made no effort to fit that role and you've made no effort either, then she is definitely not your daughter, she's your daughter in law but that doesn't really mean as much to me as some people here seem to think it means to them. \n\nPersonally, if you dislike one daughter in law and like another I don't think you deserve to be persecuted for that. The way you said it could've been more delicate but if the other daughter in law is as awful as you've described, I honestly don't blame you. \n\nI'm a little surprised by the response to this one, I genuinely think you are allowed to dislike family members especially inlaws, that's your choice.

I wasn\u2019t aware of my \u201cstatus\u201d until I wasn\u2019t the only girl.", "No one said anything either, so it was like, \u201c\u2026did that just?\u201d I made sure to put my \u201cgrubby hands\u201d all over his pristine white walls when he wasn\u2019t looking.", "why did you post here if you refuse to take any criticism? you make excuses for everything as if you don\u2019t know exactly how it came across. quit acting like a child and at least take some responsibility!", "Lol you are trying to score points against random redditors, you are so fucked up.", "girl you have NO DAUGHTERS. you were daughterless before your sons were married and you still are lmao you are hilarious. but yk good you were an AH and told that. now new DIL is aware of how much of an Ah you are. and she can stay away when she needs to.", "You keep dodging what everyone is saying here. \n\nYou're allowed to not like your other DIL. You're allowed to like one more than the other. Those things, without any other context, don't make you TA. \n\nWhat makes you TA is that you said in front of everyone.", "Saw no reference to \u201cdad\u201d", "I kinda get it. If OP isn't willing to lose a relationship with his son, then son and son's wife are a package deal. I hated my mom with a passion, but love my dad immensely. Even though he thoroughly enabled her, I never cut contact with her because I didn't want to lose him. So I had to put up with her shit until she finally died. \n\nAll that being said, what OP said at dinner is still pretty shitty. No need to make a really bad relationship even worse.", "You can't force relationships on people. If they don't get along and they don't feel that bond that's fine. It's even fine to admit it. Especially because everyone involves are adults.", "Yeah I\u2019m actually fine with having no relationship with uncle Bob who won\u2019t stop talking about politics and my niece Emma who shrills when I don\u2019t give her chocolate before dinner. What\u2019s your point? They might be useful later or I might be in their will? If we don\u2019t enjoy each other, we\u2019re free to ignore each other.", "It sounds like they don't get along well so I wouldn't accept her either, sorry.\n\nEdit: That being Saud I don't agree with him saying it publicly of course,  some things should be kept to ourselves.", "If I was the new daughter...I'd run", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They even showed up at my father\u2019s funeral after not speaking to any of us for years, and made it about them. Haven\u2019t seen or spoken to them since.", "I imagine you don't get along because you're the type to say something like this in front of her and not think YTA", "You continue to choose to miss the point. You don\u2019t have to think of her as a daughter, and not a single person has said that you do. However, you deliberately said in front of her that you *only* consider your other DIL As a daughter, and you know for a fact that you did that to have a dig at her.", "OP, but it\u2019s very bad manners to say something like that in front of everyone.", "why did you post here if you\u2019re just going to argue with everyone and justify your actions?", "While that may be true, you still shouldn\u2019t have said that IN FRONT OF HER.", "Gee I wonder why your relationship is as bad as it is\u2026 a true mystery. Quick someone calls Columbo!", "Of course you can't force relationships on people. But at least have some social awareness and don't shit on people for no reason.\n\nOP was just ridiculously rude. Fine - you don't get along with your first daughter in law. When the second daughter in law rolls around and you get along like a house on fire, to say \"I FINALLY HAVE A DAUGHTER\" is of course going to be a slap in the face to the first person. It's a very clear distinction of \"you might be my 'daughter-in-law' but you absolutely aren't part of my family\"\n\nYou can show love and appreciation to people without the need to put others down in their place in the same breath. If you think that kind of behaviour is a-okay, then you do you - but frankly it's asshole behaviour.", "That's correct. It's also wrong to very obviously and publicly announce that you don't get along with someone", "You sound fun at parties", "I like you. Lol I get bitched at for not attending my cousins cookouts and parties n yadda yadda. N when I see her at others gatherings I get the stare. Maybe we were close as kids but isn\u2019t okay that I don\u2019t enjoy her company? Or her partners company. I\u2019m not good at pretending and it\u2019s exhausting to have to. I wouldn\u2019t go to someone that wasn\u2019t family- parties if I we didn\u2019t get along so why is it different? Cuz we have the same grandparents? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I mean, fair, but it's not reasonable to expect them to react well to that basically being publically announced.", "You don\u2019t have to accept her as a daughter, just because she has married your son, but it\u2019s basic tact to not then say right in front of her that your other daughter in law has earned that title without even trying. Even if there\u2019s a very good reason, you aren\u2019t wrong for only feeling like one of them is your daughter, however, you are wrong for stating it in front of both of them. You would\u2019ve made both of them uncomfortable btw, not just the son\u2019s wife that you insulted.", "It\u2019s called a DAUGHTER in law you fucking git.", "Look, I know what you\u2019re saying. My MIL and I talk more than she talks to her sons. She rarely speaks to her other DIL except about the grandkids (I have 0 kids, we just talk). So when we got married, she was really fucking happy for me as a person. She jokingly pushed my husband/her son out of the way in a picture and said \u201clet me get next to the daughter I never had.\u201d  My BIL was a few feet away and heard (luckily my SIL wasn\u2019t there because \u2026 oh yeah, she\u2019d just birthed a baby)\n\nNow, my MIL meant every word she said. But she also meant no malice. I\u2019m the closest thing she has to a daughter. And coincidentally, my mom died a few years back, so now she\u2019s the only old lady mother figure in my life. So, it\u2019s an innocent, truthful statement made out of love, but it is **tactless**. Like, even my husband clocked it and brought it up that night, and it\u2019s gotta be pretty bad for my husband to remember it and bring it up on his wedding night, ya know?  And I wasn\u2019t even the wronged party!  I\u2019m the favorite!!!  \n\nSo, my two cents, is it\u2019s worth taking the L and accepting the YTA and telling son and DIL that what you said was **insensitive**, and while it\u2019s true you have a closer emotional bond with Favorite, you\u2019d love to work toward that kind of bond with The Other One. And then propose a lunch date at a X time place or at her earliest convenience. Ball is in her court. \n\nIt may be that she is happy not being close to you; she just doesn\u2019t like that you are happy she isn\u2019t close to you. Sometimes men marry women like their moms. Or maybe she\u2019s awkward and hasn\u2019t known how to start. Or maybe she\u2019s just horrible. Who knows. Make one ***sincere*** effort at apologizing and building a relationship, and move on if she isn\u2019t interested. Only you know how much making your son and his wife feel accepted is worth to you.", "Neither does the other one. If I were her, I'd start working on establishing hard boundaries, because you sound like you're about to be overbearing to her and try to force a relationship she may not want.\n\nHopefully your \\*two\\* DiLs will become friendly, maybe even friends, and be able to support each other and resist whatever b.s. you're going to toss their way.", "But your son will become *not* your son bc of your mouth&actions, and I don't blame him.", "By that logic, Jake's wife isn't really your daughter either.", "Yes. She does. That\u2019s exactly how she becomes your daughter in law. By marrying your son. F\u2019ng daft.", "They are both just your daughter in law.", "Sounds like this has not been a healthy family for quite a while thanks to OP. sheesh", "Like a daughter. Not your daughter. YTA. And not very smart.", "You should feel very lucky that either of your sons still speak to you. From your posts, it sounds like you enjoy alienating people are bringing them down. \n\nSeek therapy or your toxic personality will, quite literally, leave you alone and miserable.", "Damn, that\u2019s low! I can\u2019t even imagine doing that. Good that you don\u2019t talk to them anymore lol", "OP has no manners. She had doubled down defending her indefensible position.  She didn't want any real advice -- she simply wanted people to back her crappy attitude. Feel very sorry for both her sons. Hope the *favoured* DIL knows this is just temporary until she crosses her witch of a MIL!!", "No it isn't but you can't tell me the dil didn't at least have a hint of an idea that she wasn't his favorite person.", "I'm sure she does, but there's a big difference between knowing that and hearing it announced in front of the entire immediate family. Also if she's racist like OP has said in other comments, I can't blame OP for disliking her, but it also begs the question of why OP wants to be around the son and DIL at all if they're that level of terrible.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she knew or didn\u2019t. What matters is *this man* made a conscious decision to publicly insult her and doesn\u2019t think she has the right to react. \n\nIt\u2019s toxic AF.", "INFO: how exactly would she still be your daughter? Marrying your son is how you gained connection to her.\n\nYTA - It\u2019s fine to not like your other daughter-in-law, but good goodness you don\u2019t have to make the announcement of the fact in front of her. Any negative feelings you have about her are yours to have, but you should look in the mirror because what you did seems intentionally cruel.", "Jesus what a TA thing to say.\n\nAnd more than slightly fucking creepy tbh", "If Jake or Brian were awful would you suddenly have less than two sons? If you saw someone walking down the street who you became good friends with would they be your child? You're too old to be this intentionally obtuse, at least I hope it's on purpose.", "Stop fighting people. You're wrong and TA. The fact that you can't see this even after everyone points it out to you only underlines that. I feel sorry for your first daughter-in-law and her husband, your behavior over the years must have been very difficult for them. Apologize to her and make amends for your terrible behavior.", "No, she would be a stranger if she wasn\u2019t marrying your son.", "I am SHOCKED that she doesn\u2019t like you. Must be all her fault, too.", "Okay. You don't care how incredibly rude and inappropriate your comment was. Do you even care about how comments like that affect your son? I ask that because it doesn't sound like you value your relationship with your son.", "You\u2019re a dick", "I really hope you are a 13 year old troll.", "Please don\u2019t teach future grandkids to be TA you are.", "[removed]", "Exactly,  all of this, I completely agree and maybe op feels or felt obligated because he wanted to keep his son happy and have relationships with any potential grandkids and never thought his other son would get married. Maybe he's lying about that fact just to try and garner sympathy from us ( wouldn't be the first tine someone has lied or the last).", "Exactly I completely agree, im honesty just trying to pick this apart because op claims that she's so terrible but still has a relationship with them which really isn't adding up.", "this. why even post here if you don't care about how your words affect others???", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Mission accomplished.", "Your comments here make you sound like an asshole, pulling reasons out of your ass to justify yourself whenever required.", "sure now shes racist and manipulative if she was really all those things it would have been in your ver short post", "I think that it would maybe help these down voters to stop if you give more information about your current dil.

You are a huge asshole, you've had a daughter in law for 18 years but since you're too much of an asshole and don't like her you publicly announced you're happy to finally have a daughter. You literally just told them they don't mean shit to you. Don't be surprised when your kids and daughter in laws don't speak to you and leave you in a nursing home to rot because what the fuck.", "Isn\u2019t it convenient how these character traits get brought up after OP gets slammed for being TAH. Never mentioned these in the original post.", "Why did you ask?", "Honestly, even if she deserved to hear something like that, your new DIL did not deserve to. If you think hearing you say that in front of your other DIL was a good experience for her, you're deluded.", "You don\u2019t have to like her. But you don\u2019t have to publically diss her which is what you did by saying that in public. You have no clue if this marriage to Laura will last.\n\nYou should show some respect for your sons marriage that has lasted 18 years", "She probably made that up to try to justify her point.", "That's what I thought to lol..."]}
