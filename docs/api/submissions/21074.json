You may not like your first DIL but making a public announcement to that effect is very rude. YTA.", "YTA. Keep your comments private.

You're basically saying \"I'm happy to finally have a daughter in law who I like,\" which is an extremely rude thing to say in front of your first DIL!", "YTA. You have diminished position of your other DIL and marriage of your other son. You may not care for Jake\u2019s wife but you are also an A toward Jake", "Seems like u just wanted to throw it in her face. It's not wrong u consider Laura as a daughter as ur relation with ur first DIL isn't great . But to humiliate her publicly saying this isn't cool. What did u think u sounded like? 'i finally have a daughter ' really?  U chose to do it intentionally.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA.  I can understand you feeling more bonded with one DIL over another because they are people that you had no choice in adding to the family.

That's just how you feel you don't connect in the same way .Fair. \n\nHOWEVER, actually saying it out loud, especially in a room with both present and clearly in earshot, even if not part of the conversation is a complete asshole move and would easily come off like as petty shade to anyone who heard it.", "YTA and you lack all sense of tact and kindness.", "YTA , you've publicly shown favoritism towards your second DIL in front of everyone and humiliated Jake & his Wife, so no wonder they're upset.\n\nThis doesn't invalidate the way you feel by any means, but sometimes it pays off to be more diplomatic in Family gatherings.", "YTA. You publicly announced that you favored one daughter in law over the other. While that's something that may naturally happen it's rude, messy, and petty to announce it.", "YTA.  That\u2019s the kind of thing you think and feel, not actually say.", "Yta obviously. In what way would you not be?", "YTA.

No surprise if your son jake and his wife go no contact after that comment. I know I would ask my husband to go no contact or low contact.", "You don't have to think about your other daughter in law as your own daughter. You don't have to love them both the same.
