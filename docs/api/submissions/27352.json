I HATE it when auto mechanics take that attitude, especially with women.", "NTA -  I had my ignition replaced once. The mechanic was a huge condescending idiot to me when I picked up my car. He repeatedly explained to me, like a was a little kid, how my car door key wasn\u2019t going to work in my ignition anymore. I was annoyed but kept my cool. I go to my daughter\u2019s school to pick her up. When I go to leave I discover my door key is gone. He took my door key off the ring and threw it in the trash! I was so pissed.  He sure looked like an ass when I called his boss, he had to dig in the trash in front of everyone and bring my keys to me.", "NTA this was pure sexism.

It WAS condescending and I would have left too.\n\nI remember 20+ years ago, I had a favourite mechanic, nice guy, I'd taken my car to him for a few years. I don't remember the issue, but one time, I clearly had no clue what the problem was and he was chuckling away at me, and then started to make a few condescending comments about my lack of knowledge on cars.  \nI looked at him and said \"do you know how to manage a $10m budget?\" He said \"no\". I said \"well, I do, but I don't know how to fix cars. That's what I pay you for.\"", "NTA", "TIL (spelled tires if you are American)", "NTA leave the honest review", "NTA - even if you were wrong he should say what the difference (or lack of) is, instead of just smirking and trying to argue.

So my sensor gage is always on. When i went to get a new tyre, they let me know this.  They asked if i wanted them to put the sensors on the tyres.  Oh Ok, sure, that way the light will go away.  Then they promptly tell me that it costs x amount of dollars(anywhere from 30.00$ to 400.00$ each).  I noped out of that option.  The light doesnt bother me that much.  And my eyes work pretty well to see that my tyres are low.  And if i air them up, and they continue to go down well then i know im going to have to have it repaired or replaced.  \n\nThis guy was definitely treating her this way because she was female", "And a warning light could be due to malfunction of the sensor, not an actual flat or low tire!", "The air temperature itself can affect the tire pressure as well. Heat makes air expand and can increase pressure, while cold makes air contract and can cause low pressure. In these instances, the pressure does change and you may want to add or let out some air to get it back into ideal range. In cold temps, driving will generally warm the tire up some, so you might even see the pressure increase during use.", "Many years ago, I went to a large dealership and told them exactly what model, color, and options I wanted to buy. The salesman opened a notebook full of spec sheets for new cars they had on order with the manufacturer, and told me they're going to be getting in exactly what I wanted. I looked at the spec sheet and said, \"no, that one doesn't have the rally dash\". He smirked and said, \"oh, you'll never look at those dials anyway\". I'm an engineer. I walked out in disgust and bought my car at another dealership where I was treated right.\n\nA couple of decades ago, my husband and I moved far away to a new place, so we sold our cars and were going to buy new ones in the new city -- *cash in full*. My husband left a few weeks before I did because he had to start his new job, while I finished getting the house packed up and closing the sale on it. I had picked out the car I wanted, so he visited a dealership and gave the salesperson my info, to make arrangements so that my car would be ready to pick up when I arrived. Instead of talking to me about it, the guy kept calling my husband at work. My husband was pissed and kept telling me he needed to talk to me. So I would contact him, and then he would call my husband again. I finally sent him an e-mail saying that it was clear that he had difficulties dealing with women, so I would save him from that hardship and buy my car through a different dealership instead. At that point he realized he was going to lose a $40,000 cash sale, and he sent me a hugely apologetic e-mail promising me that he would give me the same great customer service he gave all his clients. I snorted, thinking he should have done so from the start, deleted his e-mail, and arranged -- with one phone call -- for another dealer to have my car ready for me when I arrived.", "I can have perfectly full tires and after about 40 miles the tire light comes on in my Nissan. It's an 05 and I've just dealt with it haha"]}
