I didn\u2019t think anything of this until it became super obvious that something was bothering him. I thought it was just some random issue and just kept an eye on him but didn\u2019t ask what was wrong or anything because I thought it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me. \n\nThe guy calls the flight attendant over and then out of nowhere complains I\u2019m encroaching in his personal space which he paid for. This annoyed me because I didn\u2019t know I was causing any trouble and he could have talked to me before just reporting me. I\u2019m a pretty large lady and the seats on the airplane were REALLY small, like smaller than normal plane seats and I was kind of overflowing into his seat a bit. \n\nI was really frustrated at this guy for reporting me before trying to work it out with me first so I asked him what he\u2019d have wanted me to do. He told me I should buy enough seats to \u201cfit my fat arse in\u201d which in this case would be 2 or simply lose weight. Luckily the attendant intervened and the guy was swapped with someone who didn\u2019t mind sitting next to me but it got me wondering if I should have bought 2 seats.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
