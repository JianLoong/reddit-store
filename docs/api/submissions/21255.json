They even changed their plans to go to the amusement park Chiara loves. She didn't care. She was fine home alone doing her own thing and was not upset to be left out.\n\nMy sister brought it up at work. She even told them she had wanted Chiara to feel left out so she would see sense and realize how lucky she is to have a loving family and some of her co-workers, to quote my sister, were bitching at her and telling her how awful she was for saying that about her daughter. That no parent should want their kid to feel bad.\n\nMy sister vented to me and I told her she needs to understand it never sounds right for a parent to wish their kid will feel left out. She freaked out on me and said I was siding with them and how rude I was being when she's the one struggling with a teen who doesn't want to take part in the family who loves her.\n\nAITA for what I said to my sister?", "created_utc": 1688417289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pucv3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_it_never_sounds_right/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You spoke truth and advocated for your niece. You are essentially said, \"Stop trying to hurt your daughter (feel left out) in order to validate your perception.\"\n\nYour sister should be providing a loving, safe and no drama family environment. She doesn't get a sticker each day for accomplishing this; it is a given. What has your sister done to build their bond like 1:1 time with Chiara? It seems her daughter was not valued and did not benefit from her mom's quick partner change during the time Chiara lost her dad...perhaps she lost both parents in this process. Deep losses and sudden change, not within a 7-yr old's control, paired with more events of not being valued has a lasting affect.  Please remain your nieces advocate.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister needs to realize that first of all, it's normal for 14yo to not be interested in doing family activities, and especially so when she's not overly fond of her stepfamily.\n\nYes, as a parent it's frustrating.  But your sister needs to know which battles to pick because you cannot make a teenager *want* to do something.  It's much better to have everyone enjoying themselves separately than being forced unhappily together.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister wanted to replace Chiara's dad with Justin and wanted Chiara to run and cry to her mother for \"being left out\". Chiara sounds like she knows enough of what her mother is like.", "NTA.  Even if Chiara did feel left out and hurt something tells me she wouldn't tell your sister or let your sister see she was hurt.  Your sister sounds vindictive and I'm betting Chiara has been in this dynamic long enough to know when your sister is being deliberately cruel.  You and your sister's coworkers are right. A parent saying they want their kid to feel left out to punish them is extremely shitty parenting", "NTA.  It sounds like Chiara is asserting as much independence as she can in that situation and handling it quite well.", "Your sister was WILLINGY trying to make her daughter feel sad and left out, in order to MANIPULATE her into the family ranks.\n\nNTA\n\nYou were not siding with your sister's colleagues. You were siding with your niece.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is so wrong.", "NTA. Your sister really wants her daughter who has tragically lost her dad to suffer more??? \n\nYour sister needs to be thinking about what her daughter needs more than her own wants.", "NTA. But honestly, this one was kind of a tough call for me. You were correct in what you said and that is why ultimately NTA. But... if someone just needs to vent, which you acknowledge your sis was doing, the last thing they want to hear is how they are wrong. Your sis already knew that what she said sounded bad. Her coworkers told her so. What she wanted from you was an acknowledgement that her feelings are valid. She is allowed to feel perplexed and sad that her daughter doesnt want to participate in the family, even if she didnt express them in the most productive way.", "Nta", "Your niece Chiara is alone. And it seems like she feels great with that.\n\nDoes Chiara and your sister, both, have considered going out by themselves? Even if it is not as frequent as your sister going out with her husband and her stepchildren. Just a mediation tip. \n\nAnyways, NTA, your sister is totally the asshole, by behaving so selfishly. You're not siding with her coworkers, you're just in favor of finding a better solution to this problem, a solution where both Chiara and your sister get away with a win-win, which you may feel your sister is not finding (and she's not). It rather sounds just like if your sister is trying to get all controversial.", "NTA but your sister is. I never understand why people think you can just take random strangers and make them like each other, because that\u2019s exactly what she did with Justin and his daughters. Fortunately, in this case Chiara is decent about it. Your sister needs to learn to accept her daughters feelings, and maybe make time to do things with her. If she doesn\u2019t, the day will come when her daughter leaves home and goes low contact or no contact with her and your sister will be left standing there scratching her head, wondering what happened.", "NTA.\n\nShe's trying to hurt her daughter's feelings, when daughter WANTS to be free of relationships that are unwelcome.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I mean, they\u2019ve tried to get her therapy and it\u2019s not working? She sounds pretty cold.", "Especially with THREE younger siblings.
