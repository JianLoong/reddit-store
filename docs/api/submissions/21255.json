She didn\u2019t want Chiara to be upset \u201cjust because\u201d, she wanted Chiara to realize she\u2019d be happier if she hung out with the rest of the family.

I\u2019d wager your sister got defensive because she was already feeling rejected by Chiara.\n\nChiara herself is a bit worrying though. 7 years is a long time to still want nothing to do with the rest of the family besides her mom.

I love my parents and my siblings, but as the oldest child and grandchild on both sides, I would have LOVED to be excused from big family activities where the focus was on entertaining the youngest kids.  Just about everything we did together was catering to the youngest common denominator.  It's miserable to be a teenager who's interests and wants are overlooked because you're always expected to just do kiddie things for the sake of \"being a family.\"  Not to mention that at 14, going anywhere with your parents and siblings is already the most embarrassing thing you could possibly do.  She obviously likes her alone time and uses it productively to focus on her chores and the things she's interested in.  It sounds like alone time is much more valuable to her right now than family time, and I'm guessing that she doesn't get much of it regularly in a house with 5 younger siblings.", "Yep.", "Yeah I\u2019m not seeing that.

They lash out in and rebel. In her case, she\u2019s doing it by being cold and standoffish and she kinda sucks for it.", "Hmmm. Your sister is confused why her teen doesn't want to take part in a family who... would rather she felt left out than accept that her version of family is not the same as her mom's.\n\nYour sister needs to get it. Even some non-blended family children feel a little more independent of the family than mom and dad would like. The point isn't to make them feel bad about it. The point is to accept them and who they are and the relationship they are willing to offer (as long as it is respectful) and ENJOY them for that!\n\nTrying to make the child miserable so that she will want what you are offering is (1) completely uncaring about the child, only about forcing them to support your own expectations and (2) the most sure-fire way to absolutely NOT get the relationship you had hoped for.\n\nYou were only responding to your sister's conversation in the most helpful way you know how. You are NTA.", "Nta\n\nYour sister has a warped sense of love.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is delusional if she thinks she's struggling in the slightest. The only thing she has to struggle with is the purely image focused concept of having the picture perfect family, but beyond that she has no actual real material issues to speak of. She has a daughter who would rather read quietly, clean her room, and keep her own company at home than go out, and that isn't a sin, nor is it a burden.", "NTA. Your sister should not be trying to manipulate her daughter into feeling the way mom wants her to feel. Chiara isn\u2019t being rude or behaving badly in the slightest, she hasn\u2019t done anything to warrant punishment. All she\u2019s done is fail to be enthused about her stepfamily, and not pretend to feel enthused when she doesn\u2019t. \n\nIf she prefers to stay home over going on family outings, and what she does with the time instead is *clean her room and read*, WHERE is the problem??? Let the kid be an introvert in peace.\n\nYour sister needs to learn that children will be their own people with their own inner realities including perspectives and feelings, whether she likes it or not.

Her tactic backfired lol.", "You're NTA- your sis asked for your opinion, and you gave it. But I say sister is also NTA- it may have sounded bad to say she \"wanted her to feel left out\", but that doesn't sound like it was meant to be cruel. Sis was trying a desperate measure to try to persuade her daughter to joining a family outing (she should probably just focus on one-on-one time with her, because she isn't likely to want to ever go with the whole family)", "YTA.  It sounds like your sister is just bad at phrasing what she really wants.  Her kid to want to be part of the group.  She didn't start here, she just has no better ideas.\n\nNext time talk to her about trying to find a way to get her daughter to buy in to family time.", "NTA", "I'm the oldest of four kids (MUCH older than my two youngest siblings). No step-family dynamics... we've all got the same parents who are still happily married. Even though I've always loved my family, when I was a teenager, I was DELIGHTED whenever they went out and let me be home alone. I'm an introvert, a reader, and that was my time to enjoy the peace and quiet of a house that was otherwise overcrowded and noisy with toddler antics. Your sister needs to accept that her teenager is not going to bond right now with her step-siblings (she might be closer to them when they're all older), be grateful that her daughter wants to spend time with HER at least, and otherwise give her space to be herself.", "Not to mention that I don\u2019t get her sister at all. Did she just expect Chiara to accept Justin as surrogate dad immediately after her father died if they were already dating? How she doesn\u2019t understand that Chiara will likely never view Justin as family is beyond me.", "ohhhhhh ok i see, that does make sense", "NTA. It sounds like Chiara has been respectful of requests to be a part of life with her mother's new family, but they haven't bonded and that's just how it is. It's not likely to change now. I'd expect a teenager to be wanting to pull away from even biological family a bit to find her own way in the world. Your sister just needs to accept that she's not going to get the close family unit she may have wanted, but her daughter seems to be making the best of a life that didn't turn out how *she* wanted either and she should be proud of her for that. I don't get what she thinks the 'struggle' is. Chiara submitted to the events that might have organically connected her to her step-family, ultimately she can't be forced to feel what she doesn't.\n\nIn any case it seems pretty inappropriate for her to be talking about her daughter this way at work. Those people are colleagues, not even friends. I know it's socially accepted to 'vent' about people you're supposed to love, but this isn't even about her concern. It's about not being able to fully control her child's in a way that no parent should. Your sister needs to stop venting left, right, and centre and go back to therapy.", "NTA, but I also don\u2019t think your sister has committed some grievous sin as her coworkers seem to think. Sometimes parents want their kids to learn a lesson the hard way. That\u2019s part of parenting. All your sister did was say \u201cI wish that Chiara regretted her decision and realized that spending time with us is more fun.\u201d It\u2019s not like she was wishing physical pain on her. \n\nAlso, your sister probably feels sad that one of her children doesn\u2019t seem to care about the rest of them. Chiara is entitled to her feelings of course, but so is your sister.", "NTA, but I think the problem is Chiara's mom doesn't understand that some people are fine being alone and even more happy that way. Chiara has explained it, but for people who are more social it can be hard to imagine not being as social.

She wanted her to feel bad and left out so she would get involved. She even went out of her way to try and make her feel bad about it.", "Ah yes, therapy to\u2026force someone to love someone else. Always a great plan.\n\nYou can\u2019t force people to have relationships - even when they are full biological siblings.", "For real. Myself, I've never liked small children, likely due to my autism. I can't stand to be around them at all, really. But well, I come from a blended family with lots of siblings due to remarriages. In terms of ages, I fall right in the middle. The oldest ones are in their 30s, the youngest in their 10s, and I'm the only one in the 20s range. So at first I was avoiding too much family time due to my younger siblings being toddlers. Then they grew up, but my older siblings had kids of their own, so now there are more toddlers and I'm still the semi-estranged sibling. Sigh.", "Tell your sister to go to therapy. \n\nShe doesn't accept the fact her daughter is her own person with separate feelings that unfortunately for your sister are quite different than hers.\n\n She needs to learn 1.

I honestly think she believed Chiara had before her dad died since they had spent time together. She was so sure it would happen once Chiara's dad had passed though. It became clear almost immediately that wasn't what was going on.", "How much is your sister using Chiara to care for/wrangle children? \n\nIn the past 7 years, your sister has added **5** young kids to the household.  Is your sister wanting Chiara to come along on these trips to mind children?  (At the amusement park, Chiara would likely have been stuck at the kiddie pool and kiddie rides instead of engaging in teenager-appealing activities.)", "Then that\u2019s your answer . She\u2019s trying to force her own daughter into a situation that she knows isn\u2019t healthy. 14 year olds are smart. She\u2019s cleaning her room to avoid any repercussions and avoiding trouble from stepdad. I don\u2019t blame her at all", "If her end goal is for her kid to feel bad fine.  If it's just a desperate means to an end to get the kid involved you basically threw her desperation back in her face rather then try to help.", "I could see if the situation was different why she may have thought that would happen, but a death is so much different from a divorce or a separation. It leaves a gaping hole in that persons life that can\u2019t ever be filled the same. At the very least, she should have assumed it would take years for that shift to occur. It feels like your sister is being very insensitive about her daughter\u2019s grief and loss.", "When you\u2019re 7 your whole fucking life is quick. You\u2019re hardly even sentient at 14 she likely hasn\u2019t even properly processed his death, despite years of therapy.", "It actually sounds pretty simple to me- that the oldest likely gets burned out from being forced on outings with *five* younger siblings, and that she enjoys her time alone, which she likely doesn't get the luxury of often. \n\nThe fact that you think a *14 year old child* should be \"over\" her father's death, based on the fact that she's had access to a therapist is absurd. \n\nShe sounds like she's actually functioning quite well, despite the trauma at a young age, but just doesn't want to be forced on outings where she doesn't fit in/get time to herself. \n\nIt doesn't sound like she hates everyone; she's not reported to be having extreme tantrums or violent outbursts. Just keeping to herself. IMO it actually sounds like she's handling everything pretty well, despite having what sounds like an emotionally unstable *mother. The kid is lucky to have OP looking out for her, but I think her behavior sounds pretty reasonable tbh.", "Also noting: not ruling out potential abuse being the cause of estrangement. \n\nIt just *sounds like she doesn't have as much in common as her 5 younger siblings, and enjoys her time to herself."]}
