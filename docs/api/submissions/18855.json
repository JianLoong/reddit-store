It lasts until September this year. But about a month later she wanted to go again but she suggested her sister go. I agreed. So I paid for the yearly pass as well as the pass for 2 of her friends so that they could all enjoy it together. \n\nNo issues. They had fun. They haven\u2019t done since.

No reason except she has \u201cother friends\u201d she wants to go with and doesn\u2019t want to go with her. \n\nI insisted she take her sister to at least to one of these times since I paid for her and her friends passes that last until September. However she\u2019s making me feel like TA for pushing it on her. \n\nMy youngest is not mentally handicapped or anything. She\u2019s not difficult. Just awkward.

But cancer sucks and currently in treatment and I can\u2019t be out that long in the sun .. especially in Texas. And also I\u2019ve never relied on her to take care of her sister. This is about the only thing I can think of I\u2019ve thought she should include her in and it\u2019s mainly because I can\u2019t do it at all.\n\nSecond edit:  I\u2019m not saying she needs to take her every time. Just one time before her pass ends would be fine. If it\u2019s one time time she\u2019s already planning or an entirely other time would be fine. I\u2019ve paid for 4 passes. At this point she would be going 4 times. Her 2 friends 3 times. I would like my youngest to go twice if possible at some point.

I have a younger brother and if I was made to take him everywhere as a teenager when I just wanted to be with my friends my own age, I would be pretty annoyed. Nothing against him, but it's just nice to hang out with my friend group as a group sometimes. It's the same as if someone brings along a boyfriend or girlfriend that the rest of the group doesn't really know. It's nothing against the person, it just changes the dynamic. \n\nHowever, maybe she should also find a time to take her sister and for just the two of them to go together?\n\nAlso, her sister is 15- at that age, would you not trust her to go with a group of her own friends? Maybe if the 18 year old dropped the 15 year old off at the start of the day and picked her up at the end so she's not riding public transport alone, but I would say I would trust a 15 year old to spend a day at an amusement park with a group of 15 year old friends.", "NAH - I think your daughter should be able to go with her friends without her sister tagging along, but given your circumstances, I understand the sentiment behind it. Perhaps she should also organise a time just to take her sister??", "NTA \n\nOlder daughter is 18, she\u2019s an adult, if she wants you to bankroll her trips she has to play by your rules.", "NTA she wants a free ticket well then occasionally she has to take her sister.

If she doesn\u2019t like it, tell her to get an after-school job and buy her own ticket.", "NAH, I don\u2019t know why people are even saying YTA. It seems like you\u2019re being genuine and your older daughter is just being difficult as teens will do. I think a compromise would be to ask her to do a third trip to go with her sister and if she still says no maybe something happened between them that you don\u2019t know about?\n\nIf she still wants to act that way just don\u2019t buy the season passes again for her because she\u2019s clearly being a bit indignant.", "NTA for expecting her to take her sister one time and she can go with her friends the other times.", "NAH. I can understand why you want your older daughter to take the younger, but I can also understand the older one's desire to go with just her friends.\n\n15 is old enough that the younger one could go with her own friend group. Does she have any friends of her own? Is she totally reliant on her older sister for social activities? Seems like it's time anyway for her to develop her own friends and hang out with them \u2014 older will be working or off at college or whatever, and younger needs to learn to stand on her own feet. I understand you can't be out in the sun all day, but are you able to drive younger and her friends to Six Flags?", "NTA. \n\nYou have over provided for your eldest and her friends. And in return have asked that your other daughter gets to go one more time. \n\nIn the future I wouldn\u2019t buy passes for all the other kids as clearly your eldest and her friends don\u2019t appreciate your kindness when you are going through so much. A 15 yr old can\u2019t go alone but it isn\u2019t like she is a toddler! It\u2019s not parentification wanting her to take her. Siblings go places all the time together if the parents are paying. That isn\u2019t taking on a parents role. That\u2019s doing things together! And you have provided for the inconvenience by paying for passes for her friends too!", "I'm also autistic and socially awkward as a result. I know you want your younger daughter to experience things and have fun, but you are doing her no favours by having your older daughter be responsible for her social outings. If your younger daughter wants to go out and do things, she has a couple of choices: be comfortable going on her own, invite older sis to go with her some other time, or find someone else she is comfortable with. I know this is easier said than done, but that's just how it is.\n\nYour paying for the other friends passes is irrelevant in this. You chose to do this, and you did it months ago. It has nothing to do with the two current trips. Guilting older sis with this is harmful. YTA for that.\n\nNot to mention, a lot of this seems to be you projecting some insecurities. I understand how hard it is to not be able to do some things for your children. I know it hurts to not be able to help. But from what you've written, it is you who wants your younger daughter to go. Not something she asked or said, but your idea. I think there is an element of your own guilt being projected, and it is not necessary. You don't need to feel guilty for not being able to do something.", "NTA It sounds like you are very conscious of not making this your older daughter's burden and are looking for a compromise. Does your 15 year old have a friend of her own that could come along, that way older daughter would just need to transport and maybe check in once or twice but otherwise hang out with her own friends?", "YTA\n\n Your older daughter isn't responsible for her sister's social life. You're doing your youngest a disservice too, by forcing her on her sister. Your heart might be in the right place, but you should let them decide what their relationship is.", "NTA. I get that she's not responsible for her sister, but if she's going to enjoy a seasons pass to six flags for free, then she should bring her sister a few times. If she doesn't want to bring her, then she can pay for her own pass to avoid it if she really wants to. She is 18, so that would be in her right to do, but then she has to be paying. I could understand if having her sister around changes the dynamic between her and her friends, but you didn't ask her to take her every time she goes, so it shouldn't be a deal breaker, especially when her sister still wants to go on roller coasters and do what everyone else is doing\n\nEdit for typo", "YTA\n\n\nShe has plans already..... You don't get to cancel her plans to enforce your agenda.\n\n\nWhen you bought the extra passes did you Explicitly make it clear you expected her to take her sister out multiple times???\n\nYou should have just asked her to plan a third trip to include the younger sister and not try to interfere with her current plans.", "Yta she shouldn\u2019t have to take her sister just because you bought yearly passes.

That's not her child. She's yours. She should never have that responsibility put on her. You should have bought her regular one-day tickets instead of a season pass.", "NTA. As long as your daughter has the opportunity to go with her friends and without her sister sometimes, this is not at all unreasonable to ask that she take her sister one time using passes you paid for and given your health issues. There are a lot of examples of parentification on this site, but this is not one of them.", "I fall under YTA. You've changed the conditions of a gift after the fact. That's unkind and unfair.  The passes were not given 'on the condition you include your sister', they were simply given. \n\nI don't see why your second daughter can't just go by herself. But if you don't want that, then why aren't we just either getting dad to take her or trying to work in a third trip?", "NTA she loves rollercoasters and why is her sister so against this? Because it  isn\u2019t \u201ccool\u201d?  Not a good sister", "NTA. I get it, teens want to hang with friends. But 15 can't go alone. 18 needs to plan a trip where her sister can join.", "*No, you are not the AH. Your eldest daughter should be a positive role model for her younger sister.

You can ask your oldest if they can take your youngest BUT dont expect anything.  It sucks but these are kids and you need to provide motivation, since you didnt make the initial purchase with conditions; i.e., take your sister and I will cover gas, give you extra spending money, extend your curfew, something along those lines.  \n\nTo put it in perspective, how would you feel if someone gave you a gift, then several months later told you how to use the gift you gave them, which is now your property?", "YTA she allowed a life maybe talk to your daughter how she\u2019d feel about taking her sister there one day just the two of them", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are an AH to parentify your older daughter.
