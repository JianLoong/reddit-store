Not to mention time, booking waiting time, and overall experience (if you\u2019re going to sit for an hour with someone, it\u2019s a massive bonus for it to be your friend). \n\nThis woman had more than benefitted from you, even before the wedding. *After* the wedding, she\u2019s insane to think that you\u2019d even keep her on as a client. You completed 7 clients, plus bride - that\u2019s what, $640, if you\u2019d charged what your work was worth? Plus tip, plus travel, plus a $120 gift? Absolutely not. \n\nYour \u2018friend\u2019 is taking advantage. Friends who take advantage aren\u2019t good friends. Personally, I\u2019d drop her as a client, now. And then send her a bill for your work to boot. But then again, I\u2019m petty. \n\nNTA. I hope the rest of your clients are more grateful for your hard word and time.", "NTA, but you should have been honest with her about why. If she brings it up again, you have a second chance. Why do that? Not to have a debate with her, but  to be clear that HER BEHAVIOR has spoiled the friendship. She had chances to do the right thing but chose not to over and over again. She doesn't have to agree with you, but she can't decide that it's any other reason than HER BEHAVIOR (which included):\n\n1. Ignoring the fact that you had already given her a wedding gift and deciding to KEEP the tip as the wedding gift she decided you were giving her IN ADDITION to the gift you gave PLUS the many discounts and accommodations you made for her wedding.\n2. Having the balls to stiff you on the extremely discounted price and not expressing her thanks with a REALLY GENEROUSE TIP for the extra running and effort you made.\n3. And then having the balls to expect an on-going discount and insult you when she didn't get it.\n\nHonestly, just send her this link so she knows that everyone here thinks she's a complete ahole.", "I think you are misspelling user as f r i e n d.", "I would be honest with her and say that because you never received payment before, you are no longer willing to give her the discount", "NTA, real friends pay full price,  because they value your time", "As an ex hairdresser this is so good to hear. Most think that hairdressing is a hobby, not a job. \n\nThank you for recognizing the skill involved.", "My Mom was a hairdresser and our whole family took advantage of her.. Such shit...\n\nIt's hard work and it takes time and patience to master not to mention money.... It sad that most people just automatically think they don't have to pay for their hair just because you happen to know someone.. Like support them don't take advantage of them!", "It\u2019s a good friend that will pay you the bread."]}
