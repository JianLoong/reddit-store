I\u2019ve been doing it since 19 and I used it to pay my way though college and now I do it part time. My friend has been a long time client of mine and I\u2019ve done nails on her since college (we were college friends). She always gets acrylics and pays cash so I give her a bit of a discount. I do a full set with gel color and an accent nail which I charge her $50 for. \n\nI\u2019m known for my really fast and precise work. Most people will take almost 2h to do a set with a design. I can get it done is around an hour. My friend usually gives me a 10\u201315% tip which is good to me. She asked me to do nails for her and her bridesmaids. I was also a guest. We negotiated the price as $40 flat for nails as some people just wanted gel with no extensions. There were 8 people in total. \n\nWe were suppose to do the nails the day before but only 3 bridesmaids and the bride showed up as they said a plane with the other 4 (all from Miami where we went to school) got delayed. This is not according to plan but she begged me to come the next morning and I did as a favor for a friend. I had to wake up at 5 am to get there at 7 am to do nails for the other 4 bridesmaids and it was exhausting. I had to rearrange things and rush back home to change and get ready for the party. \n\nThe wedding went well but she didn\u2019t pay me for the nails. Originally she said she was going to pay me but then she said she was going to get the bridesmaids to pay me. It\u2019s been 3 months since the wedding and I still didn\u2019t get 2 of the bridesmaids payments. She also didn\u2019t tip even though I drove an extra 1.5h to the hotel and back to do their nails on sight which is very expensive service normally. I asked her about it and she said she thought the tip was my wedding gift to her. That\u2019s fine but I also bought her a gift for the wedding costing $120 and she didn\u2019t volunteer it back. We also didn\u2019t agree beforehand that my tips would be my wedding gift to her. \n\nI am getting a lot more requests for nails and am able to change $70-80 for my services. My friend saw the new prices and asked for a discount. I use to do it because she\u2019s a friend but after the wedding fiasco I told her because Im part time (I have another full time job) Im taking the high paying clients and with food prices going up I need to eat too.

Like you said, this is a source of your income. You don't have to discount her just because she's a friend.", "NTA, real friends don't ask for discounts, as someone who has started a small business all my friends/family who actually support me offer to always pay full price because they know it's apart of my living and they always make sure they get the money to me asap. Your friend sounds honestly greedy and the fact she didn't pay for the bridesmaids after they didn't pay you is messed up on its own. Do not back down from your prices!!!", "NTA - She's the greedy one.", "NTA. Operating costs have gone up as well as food costs. Edit the moral here is, if you want to keep getting the sweet deal then pay your debts.", "NTA\n\nIf you loose the friendship over this I have to wonder if you are loosing out on anything? She seems like a user.", "NTA\n\n-sigh- I don\u2019t understand people sometimes. I would pay full price with a hefty tip if I did business with a friend. Your \u2018friend\u2019 kind of sucks for what she\u2019s demanding. Have you talked to her about the 2 bridesmaids that didn\u2019t pay?", "She took advantage of you at her wedding. I get it that things were hectic, but time has gone by and she seemed to think you not being fully paid was not really alll that important. If she has thought about it at all. \n\nShe may be a friend, but she is not a *good* friend.\n\nYou give discounts to your good friends. You bend over backwards for your good friends.

The unmitigated entitlement, it's thick here. \n\nYou are well within your rights to never do her nails again after you were taken advantage of. Not even a tip? Sure the flight was all screwed up and that's no one's fault but you really went above and beyond - and 2 of them haven't even paid you yet?  Ugh. No discounts, no special treatments after that.\n\nSeems that being this person's friend means she gets what she wants at your expense. :\\", "Look i\u2019ll be the first to admit i dont know much about nail prices but i\u2019ve gotten mine done a couple times and it seems like the $70-80 is a Very Fair price as is. So NTA. \n\nYour friend is the greedy one, and a hypocrite. You deserve better friends and better clients!", "NTA. Remind her she hasn\u2019t paid you for the wedding in full.", "NTA. You find out who your real friends are when you stop giving them a super good deal on side work. I was a plumber for a while and found this out the hard way. Everyone expects a great deal cause they know you and then when you tell them you can't anymore, they all of a sudden turn on you.", "NTA.  Your friend took advantage of you.  She no longer gets the friend discount.  Be prepared though--if she does keep using you and pays the higher amount, she won't tip.", "NTA\n\nYou were nice and gave a friend a discount. They burned you. Prices went up.", "NTA.  A *real* friend would pay you full price for your services, not demand a discount.", "NTA \n\nThis lady doesn\u2019t really seem to value your friendship very much based off this post. Did she ever thank you for your actual wedding gift to her??\n\nIt also sounds like you have lots of potential clients and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to lose one, especially if she isn\u2019t willing to pay for the service.", "Hell no, your time is valuable.", "NTA. Your so-called friend stiffed you largely on your services for her wedding. No good deed and all that jazz.

Two of her bridesmaids stiffed you. Anyone who goes to the grocery store with any regularity sees the increased price of food. Last week was the first time in months a dozen eggs was less than $3. She can pay your going rate for a full set of nails or she can find someone else to do them.", "NTA, in the words of the great Tupac Shakur, it ain't personal, strictly business baby. Strictly business.", "NTA\n\n1. You agreed to do 8 people for $40 each (half the retail rate) on a specific day ($320, plus tip)\n2. You ended up having to wake at 5 am on a second day because friends were delayed\n3. You did 8 nails, but only got paid for 6, and no tip ($240, no tip)\n4.

Bride wants to continue to get a discounted rate even after you'd gone out of your way, didn't get paid for your work, and on top of that got 0 tips\n\nI'm sorry, but - **this is no longer a friend**. She has been using you for discounted nails, then got her bridal party an even MORE discounted rate - and still thinks you're not doing enough.\n\nI'd do a slow fade and just be busy. She will learn once she has to get her nails done for regular price. This is no true friend. A true friend would be horrified and apologizing and making sure you were made whole *ON A DISCOUNTED RATE*, much less a regular one.\n\nThere's nicer and more supportive friends out there. Good luck.", "NTA- she should\u2019ve paid for the bridesmaids either as the bride or have them pay her back to save you the hassle.\n\nWill add though, I think it\u2019s weird expecting a tip when you give your friend a flat rate and then complaining about it too.", "NTA.  I would stop doing her nails altogether since she didn't pay you for your wedding services.  Tell her you have a new policy, you don't do the nails of delinquent clients.  Clear up her past bill and she can get your services.", "She\u2019s a friend? I\u2019d charge MORE and and as friend, I\u2019d expect a bigger tip.
