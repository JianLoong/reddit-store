I obviously asked her if she was okay with me going alone and she said she was. \n\nThe wedding was a 5 hours drive and i didn\u2019t want to drive on my own for that long so my sister suggested i drive with my ex because, in her case, she had no ride to the wedding\nI agreed but didn\u2019t tell my wife because I knew she was already stressed about her mom and didn\u2019t want to add to that.\n\nHowever, my mom accidentally let the information slipped in a conversation about my sister\u2019s wedding. My wife didn\u2019t say anything in front of my family but I could tell she was mad.\n\nWhen we got in the car, she immediately asked me why I didn\u2019t tell her, I said I didn\u2019t want to stress her more that she already was about her mom and it wasn\u2019t a big deal, it isn\u2019t like we attended the wedding together, just drove in the same car to the avenue.\n\nShe didn\u2019t accept my \"excuse\" and said I should\u2019ve informed her regardless of what was happening with her mom and she felt betrayed. I told her she had no reason to feel betrayed because it\u2019s not like something further than driving together happened\nShe still said I was an asshole for not telling her and making sure she\u2019d be okay with it.\n\nMy friends are understanding both sides.

Deciding not to tell her, you knew she would not be comfortable with it. Even if you didn\u2019t cheat with your ex, that sneaky behavior made you untrustworthy.", "YTA\n\nBy not being up front about it, and her finding out due to a slip, you created a scenario where she is justified in doubting whether or not you are trustworthy.

You've already blatantly deceived her. **YTA.**", "Yep. YTA. How would you feel if the tables were turned? You spent 5 possibly 10 hrs if you drove her back with your ex while your WIFE was left in the dark. How would you feel if she did that to you?", "P.S. For your wife not to say anything in front of everyone, she\u2019s one decent person. I don\u2019t think you deserve her.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t lie to protect your wife. You lied because you didn\u2019t want to drive alone, and knew she would object.\n\nOf course she found out. That\u2019s a no brainer that she\u2019d find out. \n\nSo now you put yourself in the position of having lied to your wife, traveled with an ex, and thought this was a good idea. I bet you \u201cwhite lie\u201d a lot. If so, everybody knows when you\u2019re lying.

Ah, typical narcissistic gaslighting - 'I didn't tell you I did something wrong/something that would hurt you because I didn't want you to be more stressed'. The nerve on these people..", "YTA And your \"excuse\" for not telling your wife you were giving your ex-girlfriend a lift to your sister's wedding is malarkey. It's a lie of ommission because your knew your wife would object. Stop pretending you didn't tell her out of concern.", "YTA, \"..she had no reason to feel betrayed..\" -- WHAT? Of course she did. \n\nYou messed up.", "YTA, you did betray your wife. She doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019re excuses and neither do we. On top of her mother being sick, now her husband lied to her to be near his ex.  I really feel for your wife.\n\nEdit: What grown adult is scared to drive alone for 5 hours. Weak excuse.", "YTA\n\nYou chose not to tell her, so now face the consequences of not having communicated with her. It might not seem like a big deal to you, but riding 5 hours with an ex alone can create doubts, even more so given that you chose to not tell your wife.", "YTA. There\u2019s a bigger problem here. Why wouldn\u2019t you trust in telling her and being up front? \n\nThere\u2019s a reason you hid this. Explore that.", "YTA. And you did betray her.", "YTA. You have to be transparent about that kind of stuff.", "YTA. That is your wife. And I understand that every relationship is different when it comes to boundaries but obviously, you knew she wouldn't be ok with it. And now on top of worrying about her mom she has that stress with this on top. And I guarantee you that she is overthinking everything right now and if she can trust you. You should have chosen your wife. She deserves better than what you gave her.", "YTA\n\nA lie by omission is still a lie. You are in a worse position now because you weren't honest. Your wife, rightfully so, doesn't trust you. Why should she?", "YTA. \n\nPretty sure the only reason you didn\u2019t tell your wife is cause you either are, or were hoping to hook up with your ex.  Otherwise, why go with her at all.  And I can guarantee if that was my first thought, it is also your wife\u2019s.", "100% YTA. I understand not wanting to make her upset, but lying to her is not in any way better. You also had a MONTH to tell her, but no she found out on accident through your mom", "YTA. You should have told her. I get it, she\u2019s stressed, but you still have a responsibility to be upfront with your wife.", "YTA - you didn't tell her because you knew she wouldn't like it, but you decided to disregard that.", "YTA\n\nSomething bigger than driving DID happen. You lied. You told her you were going alone. You lied by omission when not telling her you planned to drive together. You lied when you returned by continuing to behave as if you went alone. The fact that you knew this would stress her also tells us that either you aren\u2019t entirely over your ex or your ex caused enough drama that your wife has reason to be wary. \n\nHow is your wife supposed to believe or trust you at all when you set this up as an \u201cother woman\u201d situation. Of course you\u2019ll tell her nothing happened, cheaters who lie will literally trickle truth and only tell what they think their spouse already knows.", "YTA\n\nYou lied to her by omission and you shouldn't have done that. You broke her trust.", "Yta. You admittedly knew what her reaction was going to be. You just hoped she wouldn\u2019t find out. That\u2019s the kind of thing you discuss before hand. It\u2019s not a situation wheres it\u2019s better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.", "YTA. You hid this from her for a reason you aren't stating.", "YTA. You were dishonest. To your wife this looks like you have something to hide. Sorry, but she\u2019s right not to trust you going forward - most people wouldn\u2019t.", "YTA and it would be fair if your wife thought something happened with you guys. To not tell her is kind of suspicious\u2026. Like why would you not tell her? Because you did something?", "Yta and your excuses are dumb. When she starts checking you phone and feeling insecure this is the reason.", "YTA you didn\u2019t tell your wife because you knew she would not be ok with this. If you feel like you need to hide something you didn\u2019t then it isa not ok. \n\nYou made your wife realize she can\u2019t trust you. This is going to cause a rift in your marriage. You should have asked her if she was ok with this.", "YTA.  You hid it from your wife, you broke her trust by lying to her.  Don't try using a noble excuse that you didn't tell her because her Mum was in the hospital, that's BS!  You didn't tell her because you knew she wouldn't like it and would have told you that she didn't want you driving her and it was a hard boundary for her.  How's it working out for you now your wife no longer trusts you?  Relationships are built on trust and now you have none. To an outsider it sounds like you hid it because you were planning to cheat.", "YTA\n\nYou knew what was happening, you deliberately didn't tell them, that's lying through omission.", "Yeah I think YTA. I think you definitely needed to be transparent here with your wife. You assumed she wouldn't be comfortable with you spending 10 hours with your ex alone in a car. If you already thought she'd have a negative reaction, you should have just driven alone.", "YTA,\n\nYou said you didn\u2019t tell you\u2019re wife because you didn\u2019t want to add to her stress. Meaning you knew she would have an issue with it. If you knew that, then you don\u2019t do it.", "Yta for lying to your wife to spend time with your ex. You knew it would be a problem that's why you never told her the truth. Don't plead ignorant you give husbands a bad name. The fact that you lied about that but you expect her to believe anything else you say is funny.", "YTA. You probably just lost a lot of trust with your wife. Would she maybe not have been jazzed for you to ride with your ex? Sure, but telling her would have let her know that you were willing to be transparent about your interactions with someone you used to be romantically involved with. Now it looks like you were hiding something worse than just a shared car ride.", "If it wasn\u2019t a big deal you wouldn\u2019t be keeping it a secret YTA", "YTA so you just shared a ride so it \u201cshould\u201d be fine because five hours in a car with your ex girlfriend it\u2019s no big deal\u2026  but you also told her you were going to the wedding alone dude you\u2019re full of red flags", "YTA. You know why you didn't tell her, and it's not because she's stressed.", "Easiest YTA of the day.\n\nYou lied to her. You broke her trust. And then told her she shouldn't feel betrayed. \n\nI don't see this working out well for you.", "YTA. In what reality does lying to your spouse make you not the asshole?", "YTA. You don\u2019t drive 5 hours away with an ex for any reason without telling your wife. You didn\u2019t tell her because you knew she would be pissed, and you did what YOU wanted, which was not be alone for 5 hours in a car.", "bruh. \n\nThis is ABSOLUTELY your fault. YTA, stop hiding shit from your wife.", "How would you feel if the roles were reversed? If you were in the hospital with your mother, and she went off to a wedding with her ex without telling you, and you had to find out from someone else.\n\nHer ex-boyfriend sat in the same vehicle with her for four to five hours straight.\n\nJust her, and her ex-boyfriend, that she was intimate with, and loved at one point. Not to mention the fact that this person loved her as well, and for all you know can still potentially love her, and want her back...\n\nNow, seriously picture that... And tell me how you feel?... That's most likely how she felt.\n\nOh, and by the way, you're the major AH here!", "If your wife couldn\u2019t attend the wedding because of some big work project and you had to go to the wedding alone, would you have asked her that day if it was okay to go with your ex?\n\nHow long have you been married?  How long did you date your ex? How did it end? If your wife had been able to go along and your sister\u2019s BEST FRIEND had no way to get there, would you have offered ex a ride with you and your wife? \nI have a hard time believing that a BEST FRIEND had no way to make it to the wedding. \n\nYTAH. Quit lying to your wife.", "YTA. If you had told her it probably would have been fine. By hiding it you turned something tiny into a huge deal and damaged her trust in you because someone who will hide one thing will hide other things and now she's wondering what else you've hidden and won't believe you when you tell her there's nothing. \n\nPeople with nothing to hide don't hide. You hid, which in pretty much anyone's mind means you must have something TO hide.\n\nAll you can do now is acknowledge you fucked up and that her feelings are valid and then start trying to rebuild her trust in you and hope it isn't too late.", "You lied by omitting the truth,   Clearly it\u2019s a huge issue to her. You messed up and now have the fun consequences to deal with because you couldn\u2019t just be honest. Yta", "YTA once you start lying you put that distrust in her. If something was innocent you would have told her.", "YTA. You either don\u2019t respect or like your wife to beat her when she is down, dealing with her mothers health emergency. \n\nOr another logical reason is you are a narcissist, thinking everything you do is fine and everyone conforms to you. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t respect you or believe after you pulled this selfish stunt.", "Another P.S. please. You and your sister truly share the same genes. Why would she even think a 10/hour drive with your ex is a good idea. Does your sister have anything against your wife?  I still want her know why your ex is now ex.", "YTA\n\nNot only should you not have lied about it, you shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place. A 5 hr ride with your ex? LOL. How could think that\u2019s cool at all? But you were scared to drive alone for 5 hours? Grow up.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t tell her because you knew she wouldn\u2019t be OK with it. You have just given her a huge reason to be mistrustful of you in the future.\nPS don\u2019t be surprised when she becomes another ex.", "YTA.  \nit\u2019s as simple as that.", "YTA, and if you don\u2019t understand why, Reddit can\u2019t help you.", "YTA for not telling her.  I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re an AH for riding with her (depends on the situation), but keeping it from your wife a) was a crappy thing to do, and b) makes it seem like you have something to hide.", "YTA for not telling your wife.  How I\u2019m reading this is that not telling your wife implies stuff other than \u201cjust driving\u201d happened.  It doesn\u2019t matter what your intentions or reasons were (although you have zero backbone for not telling her before she found out), and it doesn\u2019t matter if nothing happened.  It\u2019s going to take a long time and a lot of work on your part to regain your wife\u2019s trust.", "If you didn\u2019t tell her it\u2019s bc you KNEW she wouldn\u2019t be ok with it or you would\u2019ve been transparent from the beginning. All you\u2019ve done is successfully plant a seed of mistrust and doubt in your relationship and cause her more stress bc you actively made a choice to continually deceive her.  How would you feel if she deceived you w something she knows you would be bothered by? And then said \u201coh but sweetie I just did it for your own good\u201d ? Give me a break, that\u2019s such condescending BS and quite frankly insults her more.  YTA.", "I've been close with my ex for 20 years. I didn't feel I could confide in my ex-husband (while we were married), about our friendship because I knew his jealousies. My current husband knows of my closeness with my ex. If you feel the need to hide what you're doing, you're either doing the wrong thing or you're around the wrong people. Either way, YTA.", "YTA you knew if you told your wife about who was driving with you, she would be upset. And now she is. That's your fault and it was a seriously sketchy call.", "YTA\n\nThe fact you say you didn't want to stress her out means you knew deep down she wouldn't be comfortable with it.\n\nI'm sure you ex s continued presence in your wider circle has already been an issue. If not you wouldn't have thought she would have an issue with it.\n\nYour mother was sly as anything dropping it into conversation as was your sister suggesting you drive together.\n\nThe fact your wife was at home because her mother was ill in hospital while you and your family played happy families with your ex makes it worse. \n\nYou have probably created a serious trust issue in your marriage.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even give her a chance to trust you or even have an opinion. Instead,  you knowingly and consciously CHOSE to NOT tell her, which is deceitful. She has every right to be upset, maybe not on the car ride alone, but the fact that you were specifically hiding it from her. As a woman, my immediate thought would be \u201cwhat else is he hiding?\u201d And THAT would be on my mind and I would be questioning everything in my head. So yeah, you fucked up. Big time.", "YTA, I\u2019m taking your reasoning at face value, but you just made the situation worse for her. Like others have said, now she\u2019s probably wondering if she can trust you and if anything more is going on with your ex. You lied, then doubled down and invalidated her feelings. Start apologizing and ask what you can do to regain her trust. \n\nIt must be hard for your wife to begin with that your ex is such good friends with your sister. I hope that this is a one time instance and you don\u2019t have a history of not setting appropriate boundaries with your ex and invalidating your wife\u2019s feelings about the situation.", "YTA- you kept this information from your wife which is 100% not ok in any way. No excuse will ever make it ok", "YTA. I'm calling bullshit on your excuses. Your ex, who is also your sisters best friend, had no ride to her supposed best friends wedding? How did she plan on getting there otherwise? What a coincidence that you dont like driving alone. You're hiding way more than you let on here.", "YTA and if you knew it would \u201cstress her out\u201d, why did you do it in the first place?", "YTA and so are your family seems like the sister is pushing you and the ex together then it casually being dropped into conversation by your mom, nah that's shady. Imagine it was the other way round and your wife done this to you, I'm sure you'd be writing this post playing victim  and acting all woe is me. Hope she leaves you she deserves better than to be lied to and have you justify it to yourself and her with the crappiest of excuses. This was all about you no thought about her at all until after the fact when  it had been let out the bag otherwise you'd have lied to her for the rest of your life", "I'm not your wife but I feel betrayed and disgusted for her.

But, you are still TA. Should've just driven alone or found someone else.", "YTA - you lied to your wife. Broke her trust. Why should she trust you ? You should have asked her before taking such decision. If you didn't want to add stress you should have not taking the ex in the car. But what makes you a big TA is dismissing your behavior. Now for you is time to swallow your pride and false chivalry, accept your fuck up, and kiss the ground she walks on, and make everything in you power to apology not only for you lying, but for your false excuse and gaslighting.", "YTA You have just learned (I hope) a very valuable lesson in the importance of communication in a marriage.  If not a big deal, then telling her ahead would not cause her more stress.  If you had just explained the suggestion by your sister and asked if your wife was OK with it, then abide by her \"yes\" or \"no\".  No stress there either... just Honestly prioritizing your wife's thoughts.", "YTA! Even if you knew 1000000% your wife would be fine with you driving with your ex, this is the type of thing to mention to her and ask how she feel about it", "YTA. You communicating properly about going alone makes it even more sus that you hid this if it was innocuous. ALSO, your wife trusted you to go alone (apparently it's not normal that 1/2 of a married couple goes alone) and betrayed that trust by lying to her.", "YTA and pretty tough to claim that this was some innocent thing when you act like your whole family was in on actively keeping this from your wife and your mom fucked up", "YTA not telling your wife something you know will upset or hurt her is the same thing as lying. You were not responsible for getting your ex gf to the wedding. If your wife was ok with it, then fine. But if she wasn\u2019t ex gf needs to find her own way there. You took the choice away from your wife and turned it into a secret. A secret is never good in a marriage.

How about that. \n\nAlso your sister sucks for suggesting it in the first place. I feel so sorry for your wife. \n\nYTA.", "Wait. You didn't want to drive alone for 5 hours...? Dude. \n\nI'm a chick and drove 5 hours to Chicago by myself to see my family. I didn't have anxiety about it. You are making excuses to drive with your ex... AH", "YTA", "YTA\n\nPretty sure there's more to the story. You're 29. A 5 hour solo drive isn't that big a deal--I'm twice your age, female, and have done it often. Sounds to me like the stars aligned and presented you with an opportunity to spend 2 days with your ex and you jumped at the chance, with \"I don't wanna drive that far by myself\" as a convenient excuse.\n\nIt was your sister's wedding, so it isn't a stretch to presume you stayed until the reception was over.  You don't mention whether it was 5 hours round trip or 5 hours one way; however, if you stayed for the reception, it is also not a stretch to guess that an overnight hotel stay was also involved whether it was 5 hrs one way or round trip. \n\nWhat we do know is that you made it sound like you were going by yourself and you deliberately did not tell your wife that you would be driving your ex. That's called a lie of omission. \n\nYou say you didn't want your wife to worry about \"anything else\" during her mother's hospitalization. With that \"anything else,\" you acknowledge that  you knew driving your ex to the wedding would be a source of concern to your wife.\n\nMy guess is it's been an issue before between you and your wife that your ex is still somewhat on the scene because she's your sister's best friend. \n\nYour mom doesn't approve, which is why she \"let it slip\" and she did your wife a solid by saying something.

An argument may have been averted by not sharing the information but the truth always comes out and now her trust in you is taking a major blow. The reasoning that what she doesn't know doesn't hurt her, is flawed and it doesnt't matter that nothing happened. You made it a bigger issue because you lied, then she had to find out because of your mother.\n\nIt isn't okay to withhold information because you thought she was too emotional or may overreact.

I don't believe, more generally, people can't be friends with members of the opposite (or the same or whatever the case may be) sex platonically.

Ever. And if you told me that was the case, I might believe you! But all that? Basically irrelevent. You're lying to your wife about who you're spending time with, what you're doing with your time, etc. It's wrong if you're doing it to avoid an argument just as much as it's wrong if you're doing it to hide an affair.
