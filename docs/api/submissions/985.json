I am becoming an auntie for the first time and I am very excited. Since she and my mom flew up when my husband and I had our first and only, I decided I wanted to fly down and help her and her husband as well! She was super thrilled and looking forward to the help. Since she was being induced, it may it easier to book a flight early on. \n\nNow to the conflict. it\u2019s only a few days before her induction date and I text her to ask about arrangements for someone (her husband specifically) to pick me up at the airport. This is when she mentions that she\u2019s not sure if she\u2019ll be discharged in time to be able to have her husband get me and that she had arranged for our brothers to pick me up. I said, please don\u2019t worry about the logistics of that, I\u2019ll take care of it. You just focus on you and baby. \n\nNow, this is where I may be the asshole. I proceeded to ask her if her husband could drop me off at the airport when I return home a week later since at that point she would be home for at least 5-6 days prior all settled (barring an emergency c section or any unexpected medical emergency of course I thought), she proceeded to say we\u2019ll figure it out. I ask her what is there to figure out and I reminded her that my husband left me alone with our daughter for almost three hours 4-5 days postpartum to pick her and then later on my mom and it was fine. She says we\u2019ll figure it out. I get mad because this is the same entitled behavior she\u2019s displayed since I left the church cult she still belongs to. She doesn\u2019t approve of my choices and although our relationship is \u201cgood\u201d now, I feel like I always have accommodate for her needs. She then complains she\u2019s exhausted and has a long to do list and can\u2019t think clearly to arrange my drop off. I understand she\u2019s pregnant and tired. I coldly text her that I\u2019ll take care of it and contact her husband once I arrive to know where I need to go and arrange for my own drop off. She never responded after that. \n\nI understand her pain, I\u2019ve been there,  and worked up until the day before I went into labor unlike her, but her lack of planning is causing me to scramble to arrange how to get there which is an additional cost I didn\u2019t plan for (and she\u2019s a huge planner btw and very stingy with money) and our brothers live almost two hours away to the airport where I am landing.\u2026 so redditors, am I the asshole for texting my sister coldly to put her in her place for being an entitled pregnant woman?\n\nUpdate: I accept my judgement as the asshole. I also accept that backing out now from being there for my sister when I already committed to her to being there would also make me an even bigger asshole. So I plan to keep things as originally planned. I will arrive, catch a Lyft ride (similar to Uber as Uber won\u2019t pick up directly at the airport I am flying into for some reason) to their house or hospital depending on where her husband decides I\u2019ll be the most helpful. I will also Lyft ride back that following Sunday so it saves my family the time and money. Although I was planning to pay for the gas (something I hadn\u2019t mentioned in the post) I think it would be better time management for me to ride on my own as uncomfortable as it makes me feel. It\u2019ll be good to overcome that fear and use my surroundings\u2019 awareness. Thank you for the few kind redditors who saw my true intent and my trauma and validated them while still being able to call out my assholery. I\u2019ll come back here to update on how the visit went. Just ask for prayers if you pray or happy thoughts for my sister and her delivery of baby. She\u2019s being induced in a few hours. And also obviously for a good positive vibe week for everyone involved.

Especially if she just gave birth.\n\nYou would be the asshole if you went because the chances of you not blowing up or being emotionally reactive towards her seem, very, very slim, and that would be an unfair thing to do to a new mother.", "Wow. Your mom can\u2019t help her \u2014 which she was upset about and why your presence was especially meaningful\u2014 so she\u2019s going to be without family there after having her first child? After she helped you when you had your child \u2014 which was while she was cash strapped and planning her own wedding? I\u2019m Latina too and I would be devastated to be without family and shown such a lack of support. I would feel unloved.\n\n\nI\u2019m sure it has been challenging emotionally, spiritually, and socially for your sister to keep you in her life. By cancelling last minute, you are showing her that you do not value her and aren\u2019t dependable. As a planner and someone who likes control over their life, would you have kept her in your life if she cancelled on visiting you when you were counting on her help? I would brace for her to never speak to you again because the way you speak about her and the way you are treating her is awful.\n\n\nEdit: you are also showing her that her cult friends are the only ones she can count on because even family turns their backs if they aren\u2019t part of the group anymore.", "I know of 2 friends that were healthy up until pregnancy. Then they developed gestational diabetes too. \nNeither of them actually recovered and both live with type 2 diabetes years after the children were born. One is even on medication for it but is otherwise healthy and runs marathons. \n\nAlso, even if you did recover from it after giving birth (a lot do), it\u2019s not like they pop the baby out and POOF! No more diabetes. \n\nIt takes a few weeks and months for all the hormones to regulate again! \n\nGestational diabetes causes complications during labour too. \n\nYour acting like it is just a run of the mill cold but it can induce pre eclampsia or other issues around giving birth for both mum and baby which is why they are suggesting inducing. \n\nYour sisters \u2018cult\u2019/religion/marriage/relationship has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that you as a grown adult can\u2019t seem to travel on your own and expect them to fix it for you when the husband/dad will be focused on his family!", "You don't seem to be able to differentiate between the \"cult\" and your sister. You were raised Pentecostal and then both you and your sister joined a Baptist \"cult\" and then you left? I'm having a hard time even believing the cult bit now. You're very targeted and aggressive with your wording. You bait outrage with your word choice. You know reddit hates and \"entitled pregnant women\" so you included that in your post. You know reddit hates a religious cult you you're calling the Baptist denomination a cult. Do you view Pentecostals to be in a cult? I think it's super clear I read your post and most of your comments right? I'm well informed at this point,bi just think you're a massive asshole, you're exploitative, manipulative, petty, and mean. If you can't set your own feelings aside for 1 week of your life to be as helpful as your sister was to you, you're a bigger asshole than I thought. You say you made arrangements for your sister when she came to help you as if YOU were the one helping HER and not the other way around. SHE was amazing for doing that for you and you can't return her generosity because...why? You're holding her to standards you don't even have for yourself? You're the drama. You're the problem.", "Do you even know what a f*king cult is? The kind that people like you and anyone on reddit would be all over. Misogynistic, assholes who think they\u2019re holier than thou. Once you\u2019ve experience that, then come at me. I don\u2019t disagree I am the asshole. Most people here are recommending that I just don\u2019t go until I deal with my issues. I don\u2019t disagree with that. She\u2019s stressed and she doesn\u2019t need my trauma on top of that. I am cancelling for her sake and not for mine.", "Nope, that\u2019s not relevant to this post. Her husband is 32. Everyone in that cult marries people not much older than them or younger. A cult that spanks children with a rod and demands you live in a house Aka, compounds, etc, is not normal and shouldn\u2019t be called a church in my opinion. They did not agree that he was divorced. They frowned upon it. I told them that when I confessed my sin to the elders when I was still there.", "Oh totally, I can definitely see that. I am an extremely anxious person and I deal with it by trying to control my circumstances that I feel I have some control over. Obviously, this is one of those that I thought I had control over but didn\u2019t, and in trying to control it, I acted like an asshole. Yes, I think financially I should have not offered to take such a trip unless I could have dealt with the unknowns a lot better. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed that their offer to get me there meant I wouldn\u2019t run into this hiccup of trying to figure out alternates.", "I agree. This is about supporting her and I am being selfish. So it\u2019s best to eliminate the stress by waiting until a time when I can focus on being helpful vs resentful", "Not specifically those issues. I have discussed the cult issues with my therapist, but since this has come up, I plan to discuss it with my therapist during my next appointment so I can work through it. You\u2019re right, really unfair to her as a new mother. I was an emotional mess when I had my daughter and that is because I was dealing with major postpartum anxiety and depression. Thankfully she\u2019s nothing like me and far more relaxed than I ever have been, so her risk of having it is much lower but nevertheless, not a good time at all. I plan on delaying the visit just so I can be in a better headspace to help her vs stress her.", "Oh no I definitely believe the Pentecostal church we were raised in had cult like tendencies, but they weren\u2019t extreme as the cult she is in now and obviously I was in at some point in my life. It was a college campus ministry so they targeted college students. If you\u2019re interested, I can send you articles privately of the allegations against the \u201cmother\u201d church all the smaller churches stemmed from. For privacy reasons I won\u2019t say the specific one I was in, but this is very real. The other \u201ccult like\u201d church that we grew up in didn\u2019t do any of what this cult does. I in my anxious and resentful heart felt she was being entitled, but now I know I was wrong. I didn\u2019t choose those words on purpose to cause a rage but because I genuinely believed that she was acting this way.", "Not OP but I was raised Southern Baptist and my husband Independent Baptist. They are pretty much a cult. I was contemplating joining the Eastern Orthodox church. I had multiple discussions with the priest asking about beliefs and doctrine. I wanted clarity because both churches would use the same Bible passages but interpret them COMPLETELY differently. He finally asked me to stop sharing about Baptist doctrine/beliefs because he didn't want his mind to be polluted. If Evangelical Christiabity isn't a cult, it's as close as you can get without being one.", "If you are going to put your trauma on them that is super shitty and not ok. \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to be going through trauma and having to do certain things to avoid triggers, but making your trauma everyone else's problem is absolutely not ok. \n\nMy Fianc\u00e9e was in a cult growing up, and if you want to throw that shit at people as an excuse for you being shitty to others then you haven't learned anything since you left", "Oh Lord you're taking me back. That even if your spouse divorced you against your wishes you still couldn't remarry because YOU would be committing adultery. You needed to remain celibate the rest of your life. Marrying someone divorced was absolutely out of the question.\n\nThere was exception made for my friend (the pastor's daughter) who got pregnant out of wedlock by a man who was divorced. She had to confess her sin and ask forgiveness of the pastor's, the deacons, and the church at the altar at her WEDDING. And of course all of the other mandatory confessions in front of the entire church. Blech, so toxic.", "Glad to hear it, wishing you all the best on your healing journey.", "Does your sister know you and your husband are separating?", "I agree with you. Thanks for your insight. I hope your husband is doing better since leaving a cult. I guess I didn\u2019t realize how much I have still been projecting onto her since I left it 7 years ago. But the extend of the trauma goes beyond those years as my years prior that we\u2019re not better growing up \u201cPentecostal.\u201d Not nearly as bad as Baptist fundamentalist but nevertheless, not good.", "It's a rough road. They spent a lot of years bottling it up and trying to find a way of life that didn't trigger anything, but eventually it all came out and resulted in debilitating anxiety, migraines, and depression.\n\nDon't let yours get to that level. Find help and find a release of that, don't let it control you and ruin your life any more than it already has", "Yeah, I was raised Southern Baptist and my husband Independent Baptist (so fundamentalist). Definitely extremely cult like if not out and out a cult. And it fucked me up really good. Left 20 years ago and still have issues from the indoctrination and complete mindfucking. I still think you're acting like an entitled asshole. I think you are directing and taking out all your feelings about the church on your sister. Because you can't with the ones who were actually in charge and hurt you. She's still connected though, so she's the closest thing to \"The Church\" you have to direct all your feelings towards. Basically she's a stand-in. \n\nI mean, I could be way off base. I just know all of the complicated feelings I have towards my church and the people in it. There were good things and people as well which makes it so hard to reconcile all the truly fucked up doctrine and belief systems. How could good/nice people who will give you the shirt off your back believe and support such awful things???? Turned me off and makes it hard for me to interact with people of any faith who are deeply religious even when I know their faith is the complete opposite of the belief system I was raised in. It feels like if I accept any kind of faith then I have to accept the Evangelicals as a legitimate faith as well. And I just....... can't.", "Thank you for being so kind. I know Reddit is not a warm and fuzzy place and I completely own up to my asshole, controlling, demanding and entitled behavior. I think what people often don\u2019t realize is that being in a cult takes away so much of that freedom and control you have over your own life. I literally couldn\u2019t live where I wanted without getting advice from the elders, etc. This is not me excusing my asshole behavior, but shedding some light as to why I act the way I act at times. I certainly did and have always had perfectionistic tendencies, but never did I ever have such an emotional response to it until I was in a controlling environment. I am the type that is helpful and wanting to assist in any way I can. I can compromise, I just thrive in a communicative environment and since my sister is in the cult, I often read into some of her detached responses because somehow I think they\u2019re manipulating her in some way. And they are, I know it because there\u2019s several people that have left the same group and they shared stories of when people would leave and how the had a \u201cjezebel\u201d  or a some kind of demonic spirit. Again, I know this is getting weird, but there\u2019s way more to my story than this aita post and I am glad you\u2019re someone that can understand where I am coming from.", "Nta your sister isn't a baby she's a married adult and can deal with her husband. I just wouldn't go.", "YTA\u2026. I am shocked after typing this story out how you didn\u2019t think twice not to post it and be ashamed\u2026. \nI dont even want to give my reasons because everyone kinda explained that and i agree to all of them. \nWord of advice please just let you sister be a first time mom for a week or so before showing up unless she absolutely says to come over. And if you are volunteering to HELP dont make anyone do anything. Take it into your own hands. That\u2019s what they have an Uber for, I swear its not hard?", "NTA", "What? Yeah. Get an uber", "Yeah, sorry. YTA. You're about to be mildly inconveniced for a little extra cash in exchange for spending the first week of life with a newborn and your sister as she experiences it too. \n\nNot sure how you got spun up into that head space, but man, don't let it rob you of such joyous and bonding experiences.", "I don't want to say YTA but seriously you're overthinking this. When it's time to leave things will work out whether your bil or brother gives you a ride, or you grab an Uber. It's just not worth this much worry and bad feelings.", "Whenever someone refers to another persons having a baby as \u201cI\u2019m becoming an auntie\u201d I ass use there is a little bit of a main character issue at play. YTA OP!", "Stop judging whole groups of people based on what you see on the internet.", "Jesus. This says more about you than it does about pregnant people.", "> But OP needs to get a fucking taxi/Uber.\n\nOr just actually talk to the person who she wants to give her a ride. \n\nI don\u2019t see why the sister needs to be involved in this at all when it really only concerns OP and the husband.", "OP in first sentence: \u2018Please don\u2019t worry about that, you just take care of yourself and focus on preparing for the baby\u2019\n\n30 seconds later\n\n\u2018WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE\u2019LL FIGURE IT OUT?!? Just tell me now how I\u2019m going to get to the airport in a week!!!!!!

I was expecting to read about an entitled pregnant woman, but this was nothing like that. OP is the entitled one. The sister is simply pregnant & overwhelmed", "Why do you want to be alone in a car with her husband to get to and from the airport if he's such a prick?"]}
