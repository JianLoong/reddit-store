I have curly hair and I don\u2019t want to screw up my curls but a wide toothed comb works really well. I feel cleaner, never mind the house! But, I do notice hair on the floor and furniture much less often.\n\nI also clip my hair up a lot and always brush it out when I take it out.", "My sister has super long, super thick hair at one time it was past her buttocks. It is an absolute nightmare to clean out of the vacuum, the mops, the laundry, etc. Her hair is everywhere when she comes to visit for a couple days. I love her with all my heart but it actually grosses me out a little. The solution is a lot of brushing to get the shedding hair just like we do with our pets to avoid having hair all over and tying it up or braiding it to avoid having so much hair falling to be cleaned up later. Shorter shedded hair is easier to clean up than long hairs that by being longer are just more likely to get wrapped up on stuff. Independent of the fact that there is something that can be done to control the shedding she should only cut her hair if she wants to and if she\u2019s not willing to do her part to control the shedding of her own hair.", "Boyfriend of a woman with an ungodly amount of wigs here. How can you say it's a red herring with such certainty? I definitely agree it should be worn to the preference of OP, however the mass of hair everywhere when cleaning is absolutely irritating. I wouldn't expect to control my girlfriend's appearance but I do wish she would be more diligent with it. It's absofuckinglutely everywhere. I feel like I open unsealed containers and it's preloaded with her hair. It's not really a big deal though. I could see how it could be.", "They could swap then. If he\u2019s sick of cleaning up her hair ( I get it as someone who had long think hair) then it\u2019s fair for them to swap chores.", "Idk, it's pretty normal to shed like 50-100 hairs a day, and with long hair it can seem like more. If she has other symptoms, then yes, I'd agree to get checked out.", "I don\u2019t understand why OP can\u2019t tie up or loosely braid her hair back during the day and then brush it out at night over a trash can or something? I used to have hair to my hips and I would always have it braided then take it out in the morning and at night to brush over a sink. Totally agree with your verdict. it doesn\u2019t sound like OP has tried a whole lot to compromise", "Or EVER clean your shower drain...", "Upvote for robot vacuum", "This is an excellent point. My hair isn\u2019t as long as OP\u2019s but it\u2019s on the longer than average side. The difference in what my shed hair looks like and the problems it causes when it\u2019s in its long phase and when I do my every other year big cut is very noticeable. Longer hair is far more visible, piles up more, clogs the drains, wraps around everything. Especially annoying when you vacuum and need to stop and get the hair off the rollers.", ">People are dumb and wrong all the time, it's like the core feature of the internet.\n\nVery true", "She doesn't have control how often she sheds but that doesn't mean she isn't the cause. \n\nShe should change habits so that it's less of a problem.\n\nMy hair is horrendously bad for this and as much as I hate cooking (I do meal prep to cook less) I would prefer to do that than clean up my hair. Of course everyone is different but it is posing a problem here.", "I should have read more comments before commenting cause these comments have my exact sentiment.", "Unclogging drains and vacuum brushes are some of the grosser household tasks I have to do. Feels worse than cleaning the toilet.\n\nI definitely had to do them a loooot less often when my partner went from long hair to shoulder length. I didn't ask her to, that was her choice.", "If he has to do all the \"dirty work\" then it can feel disproportionate. It can also seem unfair if he feels like he's having to do more work due to her lack of personal care. It's her hair that's causing the issue as opposed to regular cleaning from shared use of the place.\n\nBut who am I to assume one person does more work than the other. They should sort it out on what's fair. The only inclination I have towards the boyfriend is that it sounds like OP is the one who dictated household chores based on her preferences.", "That's a very time consuming adjustment", "Just popping on to say that you can get a sewing seam ripper, much easier to use to detach the hair from the vacuum roller.", ">one partner making demands and the other being willfully helpless.\n\nvery well put.", "We\u2019ve had a Shark for years and it\u2019s fantastic. I shed, my spouse sheds, we have 2 dogs that shed.", "BEing shitty is miles away and  fittingly tame from what people jump to in this sub most of the time.", "I really can't say much about time, we haven't got much carpet. No brush rollers running on our ceramics lol.", "The Dyson is worth the investment!", "A Shark is awesome too! We have 2 dogs who shed (us humans too). One dog is a walking fluff ball and hair will fly off\u2014I call him the furry version of Pig Pen. We have been very happy with the Shark for years.", "Mine fell apart and I was sad because I wanted the TORNADO action \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1c", "That's a good point. So you think he's only vacuuming and she's doing everything else at home? Because dust is only included to dusting and vacuuming.", "When I snake my drain, even with the hair strainer, I gag so badly. It's awful. Ughhhhh", "LOL the what?? \ud83d\ude02", "Sweeping, wiping down (which I take as dusting), and vacuuming is what she says. The reason behind those tasks is because of the dust. She doesn't mention having kids, so to vacuum he won't even need to tidy a bunch of crap out of the way.", "I laughed so hard at this and also just got a deshedding tip for my year round sweater-wearimg husband! I love his fur, but especially in the summer, he doesn't", "that's hilarious", "Pulling the hair off the strainer is much less horrible than snaking your drain to get the hair out.", ">Cutting won't stop the shedding.\n\nBut it would be less hair... If the bf has hair then it also sheds, but there's obviously a huge difference between someone shedding 2 feet of hair around the house and someone shedding a few inches.", "Yep, I have long hair, I have it tied up in a braid which really controls things. My husband had shoulder length hair and his hair is everywhere.", "Happy Cakeday!", "Sorry, as someone who has long curly hair, and who sheds quite a lot (and who is solely responsible for cleaning her own house), I simply do not buy the argument that OP's hair creates a significant difference in the time required to clean the house. Human hair is not terribly difficult to clean up; if you're sweeping, vacuuming, or dusting, the hair goes along with everything else, and requires no extra effort. It's not like OP's hair hovers about in midair, with each strand needing to be individually grabbed by hand.", "What seriously?  Okay well her bf should continue to do the dusting because he's, presumably, larger than her and therefore certainly contributes far more skin cells to the dust around the house.\n\nThis is stupid,  NTA.  Living with another person sometimes means cleaning more than when you're alone.  Asking you to cut your hair to reduce a tiny fraction of that cleaning is frankly weird.  It sounds like they have a pretty even cleaning work load as is, bf is just being whiney or maybe doesn't like her long hair for other reasons.\n\n\"Piles if super long hair,\" my god she's not going bald.", "\ud83d\ude42 I said the same thing about how much hair we shed on average and people disagreed! Lol it's a basic fact that can be looked up but I guess they didn't.\n\n I agree with you, I just wanted to let OP know that there may be more going on than just the usual shedding and she should get it checked out.", "Behind the shoulder blades is significantly shorter than down your back. And significantly easier to clean.", "Thanks!! I always forget to post on my cake day. NOT THIS CAKE DAY!!", "My sister does this too. She'll pull it out with her fingers when she's running her hand through it and just drop it wherever. Car, house, restaurant, etc. Doesn't even realise she's doing it most of the time and I am constantly finding her hair all over the place as a result.\n\nIf OP is anything like that; I can absolutely see the frustration from BF's end.", "My husband and I do the same; it works well.", "But even moreso than sweeping, cutting her hair isn\u2019t going to help the drain hardly at all. Also the chores she needs him to be responsible for are ones that stir up a lot of dust so there\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t ask her to take over cleaning the shower.", "I totally agree - I just categorize meal planing as falling under the task of cooking, which I guess maybe most people don\u2019t.\n\nMy household and friend group has a lot of conversations about division of labor right now, and for me and a lot of my friends it\u2019s really less about the physical labor and more about the cognitive labor of managing tasks. We all mostly work desk jobs and doing something physical like cooking or cleaning is often actually a pleasure, while none of us has any mental space left after our day jobs to manage something like meal planning.\n\nThis conversation has definitely made me realize how particular that is to our circumstances, so that\u2019s cool, I learned about my own assumptions.", "You do know that cutting people's hair when they don't want them cut has always been used as punishment, right? It's a form of humiliation used since antiquity. \n\nI have tried haircuts I didn't like. I felt bad but not damaged. If i HAD to cut them against my will, it would be a different situation.", "You can also pull the strainer off and directly dump it in th trash. Plus because it\u2019s under the water it doesn\u2019t get as goopy as hair in the drain. Source: am girl with long hair that sheds and uses a strainer", "YTA. You're making a mess and refusing to address it. Given two reasonable options, you've instead gone with the third option: \"nuh-uh.\" Compelling.", "YTA.\n\nIf you want to keep your hair, then take over the chores that involve cleaning up your shedding.", "I've lived with people with super long hair and am now one myself, yes it makes more mess, but there are ways to deal. O.P do you do anything to mitigate the extra hair? Do you clean your hairbrush every time you use it and throw the hair in the bin? Do you ensure you don't leave hair behind in the shower? Long hair strands often stick to wall/floor or don't go down the drain properly. Do you brush your hair at least once a day? You probably need to do two two times or spend the time to ensure you are no longer getting hair strands in the brush. Explain to your BF that cutting it won't eliminate the problem because you will still shed but you will do your best to alleviate the issue.\n\nEdited to add: YTA for not offering a solution but BF isn't right to harass you to cut your hair either.", "NTA\n\nIt's your hair, do whatever you want with it.\n\n>He handles all of the grittier cleaning in our home, since I really can't handle dust. (He does sweeping, wiping down, and vacuuming; I handle cooking and cleaning that doesn't make me interact with dust, like dishes, laundry, and some of the trash cans).\n\nBut step up your cleaning efforts or take them over. NO ONE should be cleaning up after you and resenting it.  Just switch chores and wear a mask for the dust. Clean up your own hair.\n\nYou absolutely would be the asshole if you refuse to make any changes at all. He's your partner and asking for help.\n\nOn a side note. My partner loves long hair, he constantly asks me not to cut it. So I leave it long and it gets everywhere! Wrapped around my toes, clogs the vacuum and gobs on my brushes. But he happily vacuums and cuts all that hair off the vacuum roller brush.", "its perfectly fine to not cut your hair. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut lets look at this from your boyfriends POV. your hair is getting everywhere and he has to clean it. all of it. my wife has long blond hair. and it GETS EVERYWHERE! i cant stand when i have a random long blond hair on my shirt or pants etc.   \n\n\nwhat about the bathroom cleaning the tub/shower? do you do that or does he? does he have to clean the drain of your hair that you just leave there?", "I'm an Airbnb host and I do the chores myself. That's terrible how long hairs give more work. They are everywhere. And I see that those long hairs owners (its young girls) dont pay attention at all. YTA", "I think a good solution is getting an undercut. Could solved The problem, could not", "I got a Mr. Clean hair tool. It\u2019s a plastic stick with barbs on it. Just shove it down and pull it out. And hair anywhere else can be picked up with a slightly damp paper towel, kinda like for broken glass. I usually place my extra hair on the wall after washing and wipe it up after it dries. My hair is short and thin but still falls out a lot. My partner doesn\u2019t lose much hair and it\u2019s short, but it\u2019s so think that his is usually the issues in the drains. Every body loses hair constantly. It\u2019s a thing that happens and needs to be cleaned, it cannot be prevented.", "I cackled too. That was so nice of you!", "Sounds more like the cleaning is an excuse and your BF is just asserting control. If you give in on this it will only be the beginning. If he were just asking if you will try a new style that's fine but no is no.", "Hey hey wait a sec. They divided the labor so she doesn\u2019t have to do dusting. He has to do sweeping, wiping down, and vacuuming and she does: cleaning that doesn\u2019t involve dust, dishes, cooking, and part of the trash. That\u2019s their division of labor they decided on and he doesn\u2019t want to do his part of it! Or make it easier. Are we still okay with that?", "Lol same\n\nWe have the strainer thing but also have on our \"monthly tasks\" to clean the drain. Being proactive has helped a ton", "Have you tried Tub Shrooms? I have thick hair that sheds more heavily than average, and I grow it out to donate so it gets long. The clogged drains annoyed my husband and even with other strainers they would clog, plus cleaning any other kind of strainer was a pain. I thought the tub shroom was a gimmick but it has been a game changer. Our drains no longer clog and it's quick and easy to clean.", "Someone needs to create a \"garbage disposal\" for showers. Something to chop/grind up the hair cuz even with the strainer, I too have to use those spiky snake things and pull the hair glob out.", "Imagine how much worse it would be without the strainer though!", "she does plenty of the cleaning, just not the really dusty cleaning PLUS the cooking which is a huge pain in the ass on it's own being it is daily and multiple times.", "The cleaning thing is not a red herring. Try vacuuming and see how often you have to stop what you're doing to untangle the hair wrapped and tangled on the brush. Then you'll understand where he's coming from", "I'd say she's NTA. It is not her job to make his cleaning tasks as easy as they can possibly be at the expense of her happiness. She more than pulls her weight around the house doing cooking, dishes, laundry, and it sounds like they may split trash.", "Yeah very true! Plus it seems like more because it's longer and more noticeable. But it's really the same number of strands.", "Right. She\u2019s going to shed the same number of hairs no matter what. Making them somewhat shorter isn\u2019t going to impact the cleaning.", "It's almost as if you signed up for the job you wanted.

I\u2019m at 8 haha", "Ditto with the disembodied hair clump that comes out in the shower when you put in conditioner and the strands that always end up partly stuck in your butt crack and other fun places", "Yep there\u2019s dozens of reasons. I had the thickest hair and since I had covid last year it sheds like crazy, still not recovered."]}
