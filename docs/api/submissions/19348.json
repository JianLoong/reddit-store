If you have split chores evenly, but refuse to clean if the other person's mess is there, then you're being petty. I always used to clean my hair out of the drain, and there were a bunch of hairs in there that belonged to my partner. I didn't refuse to clean his hair, because that would have been moronic. \n\nShould she refuse to do the dishes if she didn't use them? Only cook for herself? It seems that, by using your rationale of cleaning up your own mess, chore sharing just isn't an option at all.", "Well, if he made a huge mess, yes, she should refuse to clean the dishes and at least ask that he helps in cleaning the mess he made.\n\nAs someone who has had long hair, I know the difference it takes in cleaning after long and shorter hair. Long hair, you see it everywhere. \n\nIf she doesn't want to cut her hair, then she needs to start cleaning after herself when it comes to her hair. If her boyfriend still has a problem with her hair at that point, then it's his problem to deal with."]}
