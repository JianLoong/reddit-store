Telling your (neurodivergent) child that if she didnt stop crying she was going to shave her head is ABUSE, mental and emotional abuse and its a threat of PHYSICAL abuse!!\n\nSecondly - if you are the primary custodial parent with legal decision control then Stepmother completely violated that!", "NTA\n\nI didn't have to read any further than shaving their hair off. Thats abuse. \n\nI encourage you to go to court for full custody.", "NTA. Stepmom is on a power trip and clearly is not a good maternal figure for your children. Your ex is also a huge AH for letting her do this\u2026 he also has a responsibility to protect your daughters.", "NTA Not only did she overstep so many boundaries, but she also assaulted them. There was no consent to a haircut. Therefore, it is assault. Press charges. If she feels like she can do this as a form of punishment, then goodness knows what else she's capable of", "NTA, she is awful.  Very sorry.   You are better off on texting so you can save screen shots.", "NTA - I would never let my kids in stepmom\u2019s care. What she did can be construed as assault.", "NTA. The stepmother is awful and abusive, and since your ex allows it he is just as bad. Document everything and go back to court for full custody", "NTA. Document and take this to court. This woman is not going to stop at cutting their hair.", "Nta takr them back to court and order parental app  \nStart a folsr before and after visit", "NTA  You have every right to expect, at the very least, a conversation before anyone takes your children to have their hair cut and I would never give permission for a person who has threatened to shave my child's head previously permission to take them for a hair cut. That woman owes you and your children a huge apology.", "NTA\n\nBut this discussion needs to be face to face, not over the phone or via text.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am working on going back to court for full custody and have been documenting as well as the school. I just didn't know if maybe I reacted too quickly in this situation.", "She didn't shave it, but threatened to last week. The cut is about 5-6\"", "He supports her actions and insists that it was \"just the dead ends\" and will not answer me about why they were told to keep it a secret from me. Like that would even be possible.", "That is what I fear. 8 cried the whole way home begging me not to tell him. I had already texted to ask about their hair. She's terrified of the result next time she goes and now I feel like an AH for even asking if they feel they have reason to be scared.", "That's why I didn't care. He usually prefers phone calls, but she has stated that he is not allowed to talk to me because \"all you do is start fights\" the fight being he didn't see the kids for a month because 8 said he slapped her, and that \"hurt his feelings\". (There wasn't a mark so there is nothing that can be done except documenting).", "I have asked from the beginning of their relationship when there was an issue that she not be alone with them. He married her so that (where we are) I could not enforce that boundary.", "Thank you. I didn't know if I was overreacting. I have been battling these sorts of threats and comments for months and they always claim that wasn't what was said, or it was a joke. But I've been documenting", "That's what I fear. At minimum it was a HUGE boundary violation. At worst with the comments from last week, it's  emotional abuse.", "I will ask for the app when we go back.", "He refuses. He won't even do a phone call.", "Please do go back to court over this. Insist that he gets only supervised visits and the evil Stepmom is strictly kept away from the children. \n\nThey are both going to do severe damage to your children. Btw, you should insist that the psychological trauma that your kids have been put through due to this act needs therapy - for which Dad should be on the hook 100%. Therapy to continue till the therapist gives a green signal.", "OP with all of your documentation, it's definitely important to get the medical aspect involved to do your best to cut down that 20% even more or make it supervised visitation due to their autism.  Using everything at your disposal is what's going to help sabotage knocking the wind out of your husband's ego.", "The fact that they want to have the discussion over text instead of over the phone is going to work in your favor. I was kinda happy for you when I saw that. Easy-to-read documentation for when you go to change the custody agreement. So sorry for your kids and you going through that, your ex and his wife sound horrific. NTA", "Yeah. I know. Threatening to save a kid's head is still psychological abuse. \n\nIf you don't know that maybe you shouldn't have custody either.", "He\u2019s not acting in his daughters\u2019 best interest then - how sad. I worry how this is going to develop further. I would see red in this situation considering it left your daughter upset and thinking her hair is ugly. I\u2019d maybe take her to a hairdresser and see if there\u2019s anything cute they can do to it to improve it or make her feel better", "Go back to court and get full custody. They're deliberately humiliating and forcing your kids to lie. NTA", "Don't if they are afraid you have every right to talk to your custody lawyer to get a temporary emergency full custody until you decide if you want to handle this through court or out of court. Do what's best for your babies.", "Something can always be done. Frankly you sound like a terrible parent.", "Unfortunately, the next step is mostly likely taking legal action. Press charges on her and take him back to court. I\u2019m sorry you and your children are going through this.", "Yikes. If you are able, you may need to get a lawyer on this. Stepmom should never be allowed to cut your children's hair as a punishment, not without your permission.", "I'm definitely not going to let this go. There are so many things, and this just tops it off. I am already in the process of getting them into a therapist.", "I have already started getting dr documentation as well.", "No. I misunderstood what you were saying. I'm aware that's abuse and already had a conversation about that last week. Obviously, that didn't help.", "I am going to try that. Her hair is curly. So it not being cut properly has left it choppy.", "I have been documenting to go back to court before this. But we're definitely going as soon as possible now.", "I will definitely be making some calls. \nWe are supposed to have a group discussion tomorrow about boundaries, but I don't see it being productive.", "Because I contacted authorities and was told \"no mark, no case\" sure. I have been documenting and having the school document. Until I get all of this before a judge, this is where we are.", "Thank you. I am going to do everything I am able to about her doing this. And we are definitely going back to court.", "Yeah, that would NEVER be an approved punishment. Even if they weren't neurodivergent, that just doesn't make sense to me as a logical punishment. I have talked to 8 about maybe doing a different style to make it more manageable. But never as a punishment. Only as an assist.", "Make him pay 100% for it. Unless there are financial consequences your Ex is going to be led by his d**k. Once he realises that every time he messes up he has to pick a hefty tab, he'll learn to keep the monkeys around him caged.", "I wish you the best of luck with this and will pray for your children.", "Ugh sorry to hear that. Can\u2019t believe she\u2019d take out her insecurity on an 8 year old - ffs. Maybe a fun color streak or cute hair accessories could be an option until it grows more. How cruel", "Okay, that's a start, but if she can't realize she has effectively traumatized the kids then definitely go speak with legal council.", "She threatened 8 with shaved head. Then took them to get haircuts without your knowledge or consent. That has to be assault and battery. Take pictures and go back to court. Your children should never be solely in her hands. This sucks so much for those little girls. Throwing hugs. NTA", "Until you are able to revisit custody in court, ask for a Protective Order limiting stepmother to supervised contact only. Under the circumstances it seems that should be a quick fix for the time being.", "Yeah, the court would have to order that. And even then, he's already required to pay 70% out of pocket medical costs and when I tell him there is a need he says \"take it out of the CS.\"", "I will look into that. Thank you.", "Oh I will be. But I have to prove that I made every effort for an amicable solution. \ud83d\ude44", "Make an arrangement to have his income garnered. The CS and medical costs get deducted first from his salary and he only gets the balance. This way you don't have to run around to collect CS.", "Read omb and its fb site for good info too \nThey discuss pros and cons of both\nFb has anon questions too\nYou need to listen and breathe", "You have the text messages with your ex-husband confiming a meeting. As soon as you leave your house, put your location on and text them. You're on your way. Don't turn your location off until you are back home. And send a message thanking them for meeting you. That way, if they try to contend that you never came over your location info can verify how long you were there, and the messages can definitively timestamp with the GPS information.", "They already garnish for child support because he tried to object to the amount and was demanding I give him back the amount above what he thought he should be paying.", "It will be over text. He refuses to speak to me, or rather his wife will not allow it. But that's fine. All will be documented.", "Even better."]}
