Like that would even be possible.", "That is what I fear. 8 cried the whole way home begging me not to tell him. I had already texted to ask about their hair. She's terrified of the result next time she goes and now I feel like an AH for even asking if they feel they have reason to be scared.", "That's why I didn't care. He usually prefers phone calls, but she has stated that he is not allowed to talk to me because \"all you do is start fights\" the fight being he didn't see the kids for a month because 8 said he slapped her, and that \"hurt his feelings\".

He married her so that (where we are) I could not enforce that boundary.", "Thank you. I didn't know if I was overreacting. I have been battling these sorts of threats and comments for months and they always claim that wasn't what was said, or it was a joke. But I've been documenting", "That's what I fear. At minimum it was a HUGE boundary violation. At worst with the comments from last week, it's  emotional abuse.", "I will ask for the app when we go back.", "He refuses. He won't even do a phone call.", "Please do go back to court over this.

Btw, you should insist that the psychological trauma that your kids have been put through due to this act needs therapy - for which Dad should be on the hook 100%. Therapy to continue till the therapist gives a green signal.", "OP with all of your documentation, it's definitely important to get the medical aspect involved to do your best to cut down that 20% even more or make it supervised visitation due to their autism.  Using everything at your disposal is what's going to help sabotage knocking the wind out of your husband's ego.", "The fact that they want to have the discussion over text instead of over the phone is going to work in your favor. I was kinda happy for you when I saw that. Easy-to-read documentation for when you go to change the custody agreement. So sorry for your kids and you going through that, your ex and his wife sound horrific. NTA", "Yeah. I know. Threatening to save a kid's head is still psychological abuse. \n\nIf you don't know that maybe you shouldn't have custody either.", "He\u2019s not acting in his daughters\u2019 best interest then - how sad. I worry how this is going to develop further. I would see red in this situation considering it left your daughter upset and thinking her hair is ugly.

Press charges on her and take him back to court. I\u2019m sorry you and your children are going through this.", "Yikes. If you are able, you may need to get a lawyer on this. Stepmom should never be allowed to cut your children's hair as a punishment, not without your permission.", "I'm definitely not going to let this go. There are so many things, and this just tops it off. I am already in the process of getting them into a therapist.", "I have already started getting dr documentation as well.", "No. I misunderstood what you were saying.

And we are definitely going back to court.", "Yeah, that would NEVER be an approved punishment. Even if they weren't neurodivergent, that just doesn't make sense to me as a logical punishment. I have talked to 8 about maybe doing a different style to make it more manageable. But never as a punishment. Only as an assist.", "Make him pay 100% for it.

How cruel", "Okay, that's a start, but if she can't realize she has effectively traumatized the kids then definitely go speak with legal council.", "She threatened 8 with shaved head. Then took them to get haircuts without your knowledge or consent. That has to be assault and battery. Take pictures and go back to court. Your children should never be solely in her hands. This sucks so much for those little girls. Throwing hugs. NTA", "Until you are able to revisit custody in court, ask for a Protective Order limiting stepmother to supervised contact only. Under the circumstances it seems that should be a quick fix for the time being.", "Yeah, the court would have to order that. And even then, he's already required to pay 70% out of pocket medical costs and when I tell him there is a need he says \"take it out of the CS.\"", "I will look into that. Thank you.", "Oh I will be. But I have to prove that I made every effort for an amicable solution. \ud83d\ude44", "Make an arrangement to have his income garnered.

That way, if they try to contend that you never came over your location info can verify how long you were there, and the messages can definitively timestamp with the GPS information.", "They already garnish for child support because he tried to object to the amount and was demanding I give him back the amount above what he thought he should be paying.", "It will be over text. He refuses to speak to me, or rather his wife will not allow it. But that's fine. All will be documented.", "Even better.", "INFO: how did your oldest react to getting her hair hacked off?  I am honestly curious as to how it went down at the hair salon.  Because that doesn't seem like a reputable place at all, and I'd be inclined to also leave a review about them.\n\nBut seriously, your ex's wife (not stepmom, because she isn't a parent, she's abusive [seriously, STOP calling her stepmother, because she is not a parent, she an abuser]) is outrageous as is your ex for siding with her.  I hope you're able to go to court and get fill custody of your children.  Autistic or not, they should have bodily autonomy and their hair is part of that.", "NTA\n\nThe step's behavior is outragious. Her threat to shave the child's head is child abuse. I don't think your kids should have unsupervised visits with those two any more. Please look into getting 100% custody because if this is what the step is doing now, it will only get worse.\n\nI'm also concerned that your child was afraid her father would get \"so angry\" whenyou found out about the haircuts. Is she afraid of him in general?", "NTA-  this is a take to court kinda thing.  This must have been so traumatic to them.", "NTA - Holy fucking shit. Stepmom needs to stay in her land.", "Was he not there when she did this?  Why didn't he know? And if he wasn't there. Why were the kids with her?  \n\nIf she did this on her own,  call the police and report her for battery, which is an unwanted touch. Idcalso file an emergency motion to stop timesharing because of the trauma and abuse.", "Record & reaction to haircut for father and lawyer. Buy some cheap teen magazines and let 8 look through them if you are lucky perhaps 8 can find a shorter style she likes gets a style so she feels better about her hair. I\u2019m sorry it happened to her.  One of my daughters got an awful hair cut about 8 and thankfully her hair grows quickly. I did buy her some hair and nail vitamin gummies, probably didn\u2019t have much effect on hair growth but because we were doing something to help her hair grow my child felt better.", "NTA.  I'm a stepmom and this is not our place with noncustodial kids.\n\nThe threat to shave her head shows that she has no idea how to deal with kids, neurodivergent or not.", "She doesn't normally do well with having her hair touched, but she does mask around them because she is scared, so idk. He has used withheld visitation as a weapon before so she's afraid to make them angry. So she may have just sat there, I have no clue.", "She is absolutely terrified of him but also loves him. So it's a battle for her. She accused him of slapping her leg in January, he cut contact for a month because \"his feelings were hurt\" and then stepmother stepped in and said I was no longer \"allowed\" to speak to him and \"took over\" communication for months even when I directed communications to him. There wasn't a mark, so we were dismissed as far as getting something done about it at that time. But I and the school have been documenting since.", "He was there claims the threat was a \"joke\" and the haircut a \"trim\"", "She mostly seems upset and confused about they way she's being treated. She called him a mean dad tonight. I had started recording the conversation when she pulled me into her room crying, asking to talk. So there's 5 minutes of her crying and asking me why he does the stuff he does. She does blame him for the haircut, so he was apparently involved in some way even though both girls and the ex maintain that his wife took them.", "Actually it's best that it's over text. Then you have the entire conversation, both sides right there for a judge to read. Make sure you keep a copy of everything. Also I'd make either text or email my only form of communication with these two. It's always so much better to have absolute proof of these interactions, no he said/ she said bs. I am so sorry your babies had to go through that. Sending lots of love and light your family's way \u2763\ufe0f", "Oh goodness, I'm so sorry for your child going through this!  And you, it sounds like you just want the best for both of them, poor kiddos \u2639\ufe0f.  That really bums me out that she's masking at 8, especially when she's at the house of someone who is a biological parent but just doesn't seem to give AF.  When you say withheld visitation as a weapon, does that mean he has threatened to not see your child, in an attempt to get her to comply with his wants?  If so, that's completely fucked.  I'm afraid to say more in case the courts could come after you for parental alienation, but FFS your kiddos need to know that no one should force them to cut their hair as a punishment.", "Call the salon and ask if they are in the habit of letting strangers bring in  kids they aren't related to for haircuts.  Scare them.", "You should have the court order HIM only to communicate via a court approved communication app. Family wizard and talking parents are two I've heard of.", "You are not required to speak with her. If he wants to pout, let him.  More evidence for when you go for sole custody.", "Thank you. I'm doing everything that I can to get as much proof as possible to get full custody. I have tried to coparent but they just aren't interested in anything but counterparenting", "He skipped three visits making weekly calls saying \"are you going to say you lied yet? No, then I'm not picking you up.\"  I have documentation that he CHOSE not to show.", "I live in a different city and my daughter can't tell me the name of the salon.", "I am definitely going to ask for this. When she was handling communication she was outright combative with me.", "I have kept track of all communications since the split. And have proof of him skipping several visits. And her texting that he would not be communicating with me directly. It was in a group chat, anytime I asked a question, he would ignore until SHE asked him directly and then he would respond. I have all the records.", "Duuuude! He's trying to manipulate  children into saying they lied, so he'll show up and pick them up when it's his scheduled time with them?!  JFC that's so jacked up, I have no words.  I'm glad you're keeping documentation, especially if your children have more trouble advocating for/voicing their thoughts/feelings.  I really hope you can afford to go to court and further limit his access to your children, it doesn't sound like your ex cares about their wants and needs.  Keep standing up for your children, I don't imagine it's easy as he is abusive, but this internet stranger believes in you and that you can do it \ud83d\udc9c", "I will look into that.", "Thank you. The school psych, teachers, and social workers have been helping me get the documentation and find her some help. It's just been an uphill battle. It seems like an easy \"take it back to court and change the order,\" but that takes a lot of proof especially where we are where they value \"parent rights and preservation of natural families\" above all else.", "Omg I would freak, & honestly if he doesn't take this seriously I'd see what my legal options are. I wouldn't trust to her to be around them until she takes parenting classes for children with autism. Protect your children. Cutting a kid's hair because of crying is a form of abuse for even neurotypical children, let alone Neurodivergent children.", "I'm not your lawyer, but tbh having this conversation over text or email actually is probably in your best interest too, because now you'll have a record of what's said when you present it to the judge.", "In some states, cutting a childs hair is considered ASSAULT and is a PUNISHABLE CRIME. They made the law for situations almost exactly like this one OP. Check it out to see if you can have her arrested for assaulting your child.  It may not be taken seriously where you live, but, you should still find out. The almighty Google should be able to answer.", "Chiming in with my personal experience as an autistic person raised in an abusive household, I took everything said in anger as literal and it still messes with me now. It seems to me that a haircut was threatened as punishment for an action. By my trauma logic that means that the action deserving that punishment occurred and this is the punishment. If hypothetically something was said along the lines of \u201cif you don\u2019t stop I\u2019ll shave your head and you\u2019ll look so ugly no one will want to be around you\u201d then that could be interpreted as everyone is going to leave and be mad. My mother once told me (4at the time)in a fit of rage that she hates me and her life would be easier if was dead. So from then on, every time she punished me I was always scared this time is the time she\u2019s going to do it. Took me 22 years and 2 years of therapy to  realize that was just empty rage. Literally just took it as fact that one day she will realize I\u2019m not worth the effort and that\u2019s it. As  I\u2019m much older now I can look back at it and laugh. But yeah I\u2019d be really cautious about exposing your autistic kids to verbally abusive homes as it can really mess with their minds in a whole different way that\u2019s nearly impossible to explain from an autistic person to a neurotypical person.", "That's better for you. You will have the entire exchange in writing. Nobody can despute what's been said at a later date. Get then to admit they cut her hair and threatened her. I saw your comment about 8 being slapped as well, get them to discuss as much as possible in writing. That way, Nobody can lie about what was said. He's actually doing you a favour there, probably without realising.", "And I would argue that the kids being autistic shouldn't matter. The stepmom had no right or authority to cut the girls' hair - full stop.", "Getting them away from her/him I would argue is more of a priority than therapy. Therapy will only go so far while your still in an abusive situation.", "OP I have spent nearly 19 years in the Family Court because of my Brother and I've had most of the custody since he was 14. It's such a horrible system to be in, and it takes up so much of your time and money. But I learned about 8 years in, that sometimes you need to go back to court even if it's not a huge deal. Even small things like who can take him Interstate, I took those things back to court. \nMy Brothers Mother is emotionally abusive and she also lost all of her kids over the years. I had to keep fighting because she was damaging my brother emotionally. He's 19 now and he's a happy, healthy and honestly awesome kid. Take this straight back to court. These people will damage your kids and it seems like you're pretty awesome and you know this.  I hope your Girls are OK!", "That's so fucked up. I'm so sorry, OP. It's insane that she would have to endure more abuse, just to get proof of it for the courts. I was a victim of this system as a child too, let's just say I am now no contact with my father as an adult.", "B", "Are you sure it was a reputable salon, and not just the stepmom hacking at her hair herself? Was your kid able to say? If they can't cough up receipts from the appointment then I'd take them with a grain of salt. (Also would be good for the court records to have the receipts from the salon).", "NTA Stepmother is NOT  a mother. Tell her to back off your kid !!!!", "Isn\u2019t this classified as abuse? NTA technically but you need to get your kids away from there", " Oh HELL NO \u2026 NTA at all honestly I commented you on not snapping out immediately but she does not need to be around your children at all and specially saying she\u2019d cut her hair if she don\u2019t stop crying ! the dad & step mother are AH for sure", "She deserves a slap I would seriously consider not sending them over anymore. She\u2019s a witch god knows how she treats them.", "NTA\n\nBut you don't need us, you need to talk to your lawyer/family court.  This is a big deal.  Yes, this *is* worth going to court over, to protect your daughters.", "NTA OP.  Stepmom needs to butt out.", "NTA.  Talk to your attorney NOW.", "This is abuse please get a lawyer and restrict all access. NTA", "I am so sorry I know how it is and you're doing your best 100%. These situations are exactly why those apps exist.", "Wow stepmother has snagged herself a real keeper."]}
