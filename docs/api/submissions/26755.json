We live together and have a really good relationship. She's witty, beautiful, and like the smartest person I've ever met. She's very imaginative and a great artist. She has some quirks though. They aren't annoying or bad or anything, they're just noticeable sometimes:\n\n1. Her cultural reference point is sometimes really odd. Like \"has never heard of the Simpsons but is a fan of a play from 1830s too obscure to have a wikipedia article\". Sometimes I search for things she talks about and I can't even find them.\n2. She's really cagey about her past. She won't say where she went to school. Her family aren't in the picture. She didn't grow up here but never says where outside of more personal descriptions (no \"I grew up in chicago\", just \"I used to play in the fields in back of my house\"). She occasionally laments not being able to get certain foods she liked as a kid but won't say what they were, just that there's no way to get them. As far as I know she's just a everyday American.\n3. She sometimes references a single friend from before she lived in this state. She has a locket of him, but says it wasn't romantic, just that she misses him a lot and he was her best friend. When I've asked she says there's no way to get into contact with him again. I kind of get the implication something bad happened to him or their relationship and she doesn't want to discuss it. \n\nI don't think it's bad that she doesn't want to talk about her life before knowing me. She generally doesn't like to talk about herself. I'd rather wait until she's comfortable talking about stuff than press the issue.\n\n**The actual issue**: about a month ago was my friend's birthday, and I and some other friends went out to dinner. A movie came up in conversation, one my girlfriend had talked about before, and I casually went \"Oh, Rachel loves that movie.\" It turns out this movie hasn't even come out! After chatting about it I ended up talking about a lot of Rachel's other \"quirks\" with them - mostly how she's seen all sorts of movies I've never heard of, but also how I don't really know where she's from and the locket with the friend. Our one mutual friend present also had a similar experience.\n\nA few days ago, Rachel started giving me the cold shoulder. She finally sat down and talked with me today. Turns out our mutual friend asked her about the movie that she had seen, and now rachel's really upset about how I was gossiping and doesn't want to talk to me until \"her head is clear\". I feel really thrown. I didn't discuss her in a very specific or mean way, and our friend only asked about the movie. Was it an asshole move to discuss this with my friends? Should I apologize, or is her reaction extreme?

There\u2019s a way to tackle this with her in an empathetic and non-threatening manner, I\u2019ll explain below.\n\nI fully sympathize with and support your approach to this.  I imagine she\u2019s most likely a victim of SA and/or a foster kid.  \n\nI had a girlfriend that was the victim of SA.  I feel like I knew within a few months of dating her just from various observations of her behavior and conversations concerning her family.  We ended up breaking up after a couple of years.  When we were fighting during that break up we threw all sorts of shit at each other.  Really bad break up.  Worst one I\u2019ve ever had tbh.  I told her I knew so and so had abused her.  She lost it on me.  She wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it even then in her mid 20s.  Well, damn near 10 years later I get this voicemail in the middle of the night one weekday.  It was her.

She\u2019d apparently been through a bad divorce and was just venting one night and felt the need to call me about it.
