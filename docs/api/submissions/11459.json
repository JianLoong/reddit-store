We bought the tickets about a month ago, and my son has been so excited ever since. For the past two weeks he's been having terrible behavior issues at school, we've gone through this once before and found some coping skills to help him settle down but all the sudden its gotten so much worse. My husband works 6 days a week and it can be anywhere from 8-14 hours a day so he's rarely home, and doesn't really see any of this. I've consistently talked to our son about needing to change his behavior at school and have tried to help him with better ways to handle his emotions, but he doesn't seem to really care. I feel this is probably where things started to go wrong, but I told him he wouldn't be able to go to monster jam if I kept having to pick him up early or get bad reports at the end of the day.\nI finally was at the end of my rope the other day when I came to pick him up and his teacher told me he stomped and broke his glasses that we only got him a week ago, and he almost pushed a desk on to another child. The whole day they struggled with him and he kept telling them he didn't care. Once we got home I told him he's not going to monster jam and I got online to resell the tickets since there's no refunds. My husband had to stay the night by a job so he wasn't going to be home that day or night. When we finally got to talk on the phone he was furious I would do this and said how horrible it was of me because our son has been looking forward to this for months and he says its too serious of a punishment for a 4 year old (he'll be 5 in July). The tickets sold almost instantly so there's no getting them back now, and my husband doesn't even want to speak to me. I'm sorry for this being so long and kind of all over the place, this has just been so draining and frustrating. Am I being the asshole in this situation, or do I need to do some apologizing?\n\nEdit: I'm realizing I probably should've mentioned that we do have a recommendation for a counselor and are just waiting for them to have an opening. Also, the event was this weekend. I really do appreciate all of the input and want to learn from this\n\nAnother edit since there's a lot of comments and I can't respond to them all individually: We have spoke to his doctor and did get the recommendation for therapy but we have to wait, its the only pediatric therapy center we have that isn't almost 2 hours away. We have a safety plan in place at his school where he has a safe area to go into where there's some soft stuff he's able to hit or throw to get the angry feeling out then come back out to talk to someone so we can talk through his feelings. I would never ever spank or hit my child. We also don't yell at him and have been working really hard to get him different ways to communicate his feelings with us. We are still going to do a family activity so that we can all be together but it'll be something closer to home. I have definitely apologized to him as well. I do agree I shouldn't have made a decision so hastily and without speaking to my husband first. The comments saying my son will hate me and go to therapy for this then never speak to me seem a little much as this isn't something that happens regularly, and I want to continue learning how to parent better", "created_utc": 1677944658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i29tc/aita_for_getting_rid_of_my_sons_tickets/", "score": 275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you see this behavior at home or just at daycare? Do you notice any correlation in a spike in behaviors when his father is or isn't around or are the problem behaviors constant?\n\nIf these behaviors have been around for more than a few months, you may want to get a medical evaluation done to see if there could be something going on like ADHD or ASD that might be impacting your son's ability to self-regulate.", "Info: have you taken your son to a doctor? And why does your husband work so much? It seems he\u2019s neglecting his duties as a parent.", "I understand the frustration, but at that age you need to be pretty specific about the behaviors that he needs to change. It might have been better to say that he would have to go an entire week without intentionally breaking anything, hurting someone or yelling at people. That would give him some specific things to work on, and you would be able to praise him for improving. He should still face consequences for the things he is doing wrong, but I\u2019m assuming some of those consequences are happening at school?", "NTA-I find it amazing that so many responses are just looking for an excuse to remove responsibility for the bad actions of the child. The child was warned this could happen and chose to behave badly anyway. Actions come with responsibilities and reactions. Next time he'll think about what he can lose before acting out. He could have seriously injured another child but no one mentioned that problem. Too many no longer teach children right from wrong. Then they wonder why their children become irresponsible adults that commit crimes.", "NTA.\n\nWhile 4 is young it's young enough to know that special treats require a modercrum of good behavior. Your son when told that if he kept having reports and bad behavior it could cost him this special treat he said he didn't care. So when he seriously acted up again which stomping his glasses and pushing another kid are you followed through. That's pretty basic parenting. It sucks your husband won't get to have this memory with your son but thems the breaks.", "the parent that\u2019s dealing with the behaviour gets to make the decision. sorry, not saying it\u2019s his fault he works so much, but he\u2019s completely absent and therefore his opinion doesn\u2019t matter much. \n\n4 almost 5 years old is 100% old enough to understand that his actions have consequences. you told him ahead of time that this was going to be the consequence, and you need to follow through with that or he\u2019s not going to take you seriously in the future. \n\nNTA", "Not enough info to judge. However, he's 4. If he's having this behavior consistently, it needs to be addressed - especially because he responds to correction with \" I don't care\". There's something going on with him. He's having a lot of big emotions at a young age and doesn't know how to express them appropriately. I would consult both a doctor and a child psychiatrist. Good luck", "YTA when I was reading this I was under the impression this was a 10 year old. It's not it's a 4/5 year old.\n\nWhile you absolutely need to give your child clear consequences canceling the monster truck event probably won't have any lasting effect.\n\nA better way would be to tell your son \"if you misbehave at school no TV when you get home\" or some other consequence that is easy to enforce every single day, not a single day event. \n\nA 4/5 year old is going to struggle with coping skills. Have you had him evaluated? He might have a reason simply telling him \"no\" isn't working. \n\nGood luck OP I hope you find a way to get your son to act better. And I hope your husband can be more of a driver than a passenger.", "That is a pretty big punishment, but it was in response to some pretty big behaviors. Your son told his teachers that he \"didn't care\" that they did not like his behavior. Perhaps he at least cares about the loss of the tickets.\n\nThe course of action was set when you told him that you would not take him to the event if his behavior did not improve.

He's 4. \n\nTo start, this is not how you discipline a 4 year old. They go into time out in the moment. They don't have the processing power to link school behavior to a later extracurricular event.\n\nSecond, if he's systematically misbehaving in school it's likely not a question of willpower. There's more likely something going on with him that you're not fully investigating. Have you had him evaluated by a professional yet? It's entirely possible you are punishing him for things completely beyond his power to control.", "NTA for following through, but I'm concerned about him showing these behaviors within the past few weeks. What has changed recently? Look into the following:\n\nIs your husband working more? Has your son's schedule changed (less sleep, more sugar, watching shows that he shouldn't, spending more time with relatives instead of at home)? \n\nIs there a new kid in school that he isn't getting along with? Did the teacher change the classroom routine and he doesn't know how to adjust? Does someone get to the block station every day before him and he's mad that he has to play with the kitchen station? \n\nAges 2-4 is an unfair age to kids. Their emotions grow quickly but their ability to explain or process hasn't developed yet. Hopefully you will find a cause soon. Good luck.", "YTA \n\nYour kid rarely sees his dad.   Has behavior issues at school.    \n\nHe's unhappy for a reason.    \n\nHe's FOUR.   Is this pre-school?  \n\nTake him to a psychologist and find out if he has learning problems, or if it's a psychological behavior issue.   \n\nTaking away something that he's been looking forward to for months isn't going to improve his behavior.    \n\nAs for you - take some early childhood education class.   If you think that punishment was appropriate, you need help parenting, too.   \n\nIt's hard to parent when your s/o is working all the time.   But you really need to think more about the age of your kid and how important age appropriate discipline is.  \n\nYour kid doesn't know how to cope with frustration and anger.  It's your job to teach him appropriate ways to do that.    (Not by yelling or spanking, by the way.)     He needs to be able to express his anger in a healthy way without repercussions.    (using words instead of physically breaking things.)", "I don\u2019t think this is an age appropriate punishment - no matter how many times you may say the words, he\u2019s not old enough to comprehend a tangentially-related punishment **is** a punishment for his behaviour. The two things just don\u2019t connect. Time outs, teaching him to respect his belongings and to not hurt other people, are what is needed here. I understand that you don\u2019t want to reward a child who is acting out, but you\u2019re not teaching him anything with this - and you\u2019ve also deprived your husband of something he was looking forward to, and levied a huge punishment without his input. YTA.", "NTA, if it had been a one time thing with an impulsive threat, I would hope you would walk it back. This is an established pattern with an escalation and serious consequences. Your husband is wrong and has not had to experience any of the consequences of your sons behaviour.  He\u2019s old enough to understand serious actions have serious consequences.", "Info: Have you asked your son what is happening that makes him that upset at school? Are other kids mean to him? Is the teacher short with him? Is it too loud? I agree with another poster about seeing a diagnosis as there could be other things going on. At 4 years old though, I think the punishment is way too harsh. He\u2019s still learning how to regulate his emotions.", "NTA, I think a lot of readers are glossing over the fact that you told your son you\u2019d take the tickets back if you kept having to pick him up from school for his behavior. I have a story, When I was four, I busted my lip after my mom REPEATEDLY told me to stop what I was doing & that I\u2019d end up getting hurt. Sure enough on Christmas Eve I had to be rushed to the hospital to put stitches in my lip. I will NEVER forget my mom kept telling me to stop and if I didn\u2019t it\u2019d be consequences. I just didn\u2019t listen. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know the consequences, & yeah he\u2019s four but I promise he knows better he just doesn\u2019t want to listen.", "NTA. Had something similar with my son at about the same age. His dad and I weren't together, but my son knew that if he was being punished at one parent's house, it carried over to the other. His dad was planning to take him to see professional wrestling. My son then had an incident at school and compounded the situation by lying to me about it. When his dad found out, he told my son he was no longer going to wrestling. Dad took a friend and son was with me that night.", "NTA.\n\nBut please get him checked medically. It sounds like there might be an underlying problem and he likely needs professional help to navigate through it.", "NTA, but it sounds like more than a tantrum. You may want to look at medical causes for the behavior swings if he is getting violent and can't control it. Ignoring it will not make him grow out of it.", "YTA\n\n4. He is 4. You said dad is rarely home.  All these behavior issues. Kids problems do not magically appear. You are in the process of getting counseling that is good. But age appropriate reward and punishment is needed. \n\nWhen you take your child in for well visits does the give you a list of things your child should be doing at 4?  Things like concentration for 10 min periods on one subject.  Picking up a toy when they are finished with it. Building a tower of 10 blocks high.  Knowing what your 4 year old should be capable of and not capable of will give you more reasonable expectations to what they can do. \n\nAnd my first thought is...how much sleep does your child get?  At 4 children should still be sleeping like 10 hours a day.  No one can function properly without enough sleep.", "NTA.  \nI was gonna ask for more info, but to be fair, you did warn your son you'd do this. Selling tickets for an event seems like a reasonable punishment, especially when your child is misbehaving and literally saying he doesn't care. You probably should've talked to your husband about this beforehand, but honestly, if he's not the one dealing with your son's attitude, then he shouldn't have a say in this.", "NTA. He\u2019s definitely old enough to learn that actions have consequences. His actions are particularly bad. He will learn.", "Honestly, I\u2019m not sure, but for now NTA.

It\u2019s a tough tightrope to walk as a parent.  It sounds like you are doing the best you can.  Some of what you are describing sounds a lot like my son at 4yo. My son was diagnosed with ADHD at 6 and it\u2019s been a whole \u201cjourney.\u201d  And I can honestly tell you got way way better with certain types of support in place.

So YTA not for punishing your kid this way but by thinking your husband wasn\u2019t important enough to have input in this situation", "NTA. Son is old enough to learn there are consequences to actions. Enforcing this life lesson early on may save you further issues in the future.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to understand that his behavior needed to be improved. He was warned that he wouldn't get to go to Monster Jam if he didn't behave. If he can fixate on wanting to go to Monster Jam for months, he can fixate on good behavior to be able to go for a few weeks.\n\nMonster Jam happens often enough that he can go to the next one if his behavior improves.", "YTA.

Seems like a reasonable punishment to me.", "NTA. Rewarding children for shitty behaviour got us Donald Trump.\n\nSeriously, almost 5 is old enough to make the connection between behaviour and consequence, and I applaud you for removing something that matters to your child and will last in memory after warning him that the consequence would be there.

At this age, whatever the problem is, is most likely out of his control (developmentally) and kids this age don't understand delayed consequences. They don't connect to any specific problem.

Omg.", "YTA - but it does sound like you are struggling and just trying to do your best. It would be good if your husband could be more empathetic to the situation.\n\nI said YTA, though, because he is just little, 4 (or even five) feels too young  to really be expected to understand the link and there could be so many reasons for his school behaviors that might mean he's just struggling and perhaps isn't even ready for that environment.\n\nGood luck - I hope you and your husband are able to work through this in a way that supports each other's perspective where he also recognizes why you did what you did even if he disagrees.", "YTA. He\u2019s FOUR. They act up, have big emotions and are still learning. What you just did is most definitely something that boy is going to bring up in therapy years from now over why he and his mom don\u2019t speak anymore.\n\nSounds like the kid misses his dad and needs more one on one time, not to be punished this harshly without even trying counseling first. Actions have consequences sure but these consequences were extreme and when it\u2019s something they\u2019ve been looking forward to for months there was definitely other actions that could have been taken first. You also punished his dad by taking away something he was very likely looking forward to doing with the kid also and you shouldn\u2019t at all have made this decision yourself while mad.", "NTA if it was a one off incident maybe but it\u2019s ongoing and he needs to understand actions have consequences.", "YTA He's probably acting out so much because he doesn't hardly see his dad.", "Nta, but I will say you sound very understandably frustrated with your child. How much help has dad been with the behavioral issues since you mentioned dad works a good bit? Have you taken your son in see anyone in regards to the issues you are having? I'm sure some outside help would be beneficial if accessible.\n\nI'll say as well it might just be my opinion but you're never too young to learn actions have consequences. I do feel the punishment was age appropriate.", "Soft YTA.   \n\n\nI get how draining and frustrating and exhausting it is dealing with your son acting up like this, especially with zero help from his dad.  \n\n\nBut a 4-year-old doesn't behave like this out without a reason, and that reason is not, I guarantee it, anything within that 4-year-old's control.   \n\n\nThe reason may well be something that if he were older. he would cope with better or have more verbal skills to tell you about, but as it is, yes, while your husband should be doing more to help and I hate to give him the props, he's right - this is not an age-appropriate punishment for this kind of behaviour.   \n\n\nPlease, apologise to your son - try to explain to him how tired and mad you got and how you, like him, do things you regret when you are tired and mad: hug him and tell him you love him: and take him to a child therapist to find out why he's been acting like this. And figure out some thing he can go to as a treat to make up a bit for monster mash, okay?

Your husband is the asshole too as it seems he\u2019s overreacting.", "NTA. Not harsh at all. Hes been warned again and again.

Emotional regulation is tough enough at that age, without the addition of dad being gone a lot. YTA", "That\u2019s tough. I think ESH. Husband for not being a father, kiddo for not listening even though he\u2019s 4 and your punishment is a tad too harsh because the overriding issues aren\u2019t his fault, they\u2019re probably because dad is never home.", "NTA.  Big punishment for big misbehavior.  You had talked to him about the ongoing misbehavior, you gave him consequences, you warned him.   Even at 4, he's old enough to understand that being a brat has consequences.  As for your husband, he doesn't have any room to talk.  He isn't there and unless/until he's an equal parent/partner he doesn't get to comment on what the primary parent does.", "YTA.  that\u2019s a big consequence for a little guy to learn from.", "When you told him originally that he could go, did you let him know that it would be contingent on his behavior? (in which case NTA) or did you decide to start holding it over his head after you had already told him he could go (in which case YTA)\n\nTelling a child that you will do something and then changing your mind and making it contingent on their behavior is not great for them for learning trust, which is then not great for their emotional well being and may not be as help with behavioral issues as you're hoping", "YTA.  It's not about what you did, it's about when you did it.  For a punishment to \"sink in\", it has to be timely.  Extreme example.  Kid gets an F on his first-grade English exam.  When he turns 16, he asks to buy a car.  You tell him \"NO\" because he failed his first-grade English exam.  (now what did that accomplish?????)\n\nYour monster jam punishment was not a bad idea, but the timing sucks.  For example.  The day of monster jam, little johnny is being a real terror.  Threw a brick through the neighbor's window, shaved your own pet cat, grabbed a can of red paint from the garage and dumped it all on the living room TV.  And that was all just his mid-morning warm-up.  Of course he is WELL AWARE that today is monster jam day.  So if you tell him that his behavior has caused you to give away or sell the tickets to monster jam....\n\nNOW it is a lesson learned!!!!  (Hopefully).  Crime and punishment.  Packaged together in relatively the same time-frame.  \n\nTo sell the tickets for a future date?  Just torture.  Not constructive punishment.  It will probably back-fire.  The kid will resent you and act out more now.", "YTA.

You two need to act as a team.", "YTA, you punished a four year old. 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Like he\u2019s a high schooler. You\u2019re in over your head clearly. First of no more kids if this is what parenting looks to you. Apologize to your son and then think hard about what you did. You don\u2019t think this will impact your sons long term feelings for you?

I don't speak to my parents anymore (in my 30s) and a lot has to do with not letting me go to things.\n\n\nEdit: I mean not allowed to go anywhere but school. Never went inside a friend's house, never on a school field trip, and especially never allowed to hang out with friends.

There\u2019s just too many tough factors in your lives that are working against your kid.  But, it doesn\u2019t help that your husband isn\u2019t taking your concerns seriously either.

I thought he was a teenager , but then at the end of the story you mentioned he is 4 years old. I see some problems here , he doesn\u2019t like his school , did you talk about it with him? I am not justifying his bad behaviour, but you should talk to him and maybe consider to move him into an another school. You should also talk to a therapist.

I wouldn\u2019t underestimate that", "YTA your kid is 4.", "YTA- this is basically a villain origin story.", "YTA -- he's 4. What do you think you've taught him by taking away the event he was so looking forward to? You've caused him to feel massively disappointed and resentful -- how is that going to equal behaviour? He obviously needs to see a counsellor -- and you just made everything much worse.", "YTA. He\u2019s FOUR.", "ESH\n\nI think it is useless to cancel the event, as someone said in another comment, because he will keep behaving badly. A negative consequence that can be enforced every day will probably have more effect.\n\nYour husband because he is barely home and I'm not sure how involved he is in his child school life, I don't think his opinion is very informed so maybe he shouldn't complain much and be more supportive, I'm not saying he should agree with you necessarily (because again, cancelling the concert wasn't really the most useful approach), but calling you horrible and refusing to speak to you is uncalled for.\n\nLastly, and I know this will be taken care of with the counselor in the future, at 4/5 years old I knew better than pushing a desk onto a another child (or onto anything really) and break my own things. Also this behaviour doesn't seem like a one time thing. I'm not sure to what extent this is a normal behaviour for a kid his age. Maybe there is something else going on?

We bought the tickets about a month ago, and my son has been so excited ever since. For the past two weeks he's been having terrible behavior issues at school, we've gone through this once before and found some coping skills to help him settle down but all the sudden its gotten so much worse. My husband works 6 days a week and it can be anywhere from 8-14 hours a day so he's rarely home, and doesn't really see any of this. I've consistently talked to our son about needing to change his behavior at school and have tried to help him with better ways to handle his emotions, but he doesn't seem to really care. I feel this is probably where things started to go wrong, but I told him he wouldn't be able to go to monster jam if I kept having to pick him up early or get bad reports at the end of the day.\nI finally was at the end of my rope the other day when I came to pick him up and his teacher told me he stomped and broke his glasses that we only got him a week ago, and he almost pushed a desk on to another child. The whole day they struggled with him and he kept telling them he didn't care.

His behavior may get better, but the fact that the tickets are gone won't change.", "NTA. There's consequences for poor behavior. People who have saying that four year olds don't understand consequences are forgetting that you would still have to take him to monster jam. He's not showing improvement in his behavior, so he's probably going to behave badly at monster jam. You're already tired and basically solo. That sounds like a potential nightmare.", "YTA. But you haven\u2019t ruined your relationship with your child. He\u2019ll forget all about this specific incident. Don\u2019t get too down on yourself, we\u2019ve all overreacted as parents.", "Yta. I thought this was about a pre-teen, he\u2019s freaking 4!", "NTA. on a side note, dont come here for parenting advice. Most of the people here are children themselves.", "YTA consequences at this age need to be immediate to be effective. You can\u2019t tell them that something they did at 8 am is affecting them at 8 pm. They don\u2019t make the connection. Especially if there may be something else going on with him emotionally or whatnot. \n\nAt home you can make rules and expectations and follow through with them. You can talk about behavior at school too. But it\u2019s just not an age appropriate punishment to cancel something your kid has wanted for months. At his age it\u2019s obviously really hard for him to even control his behavior daily. \n\nPlease get some overall help and support for him.", "I\u2019m starting to see why so many kids across all grade levels are pushing teachers to the point no one wants to work in that job anymore with how many of y\u2019all are thoroughly convinced she\u2019s in the wrong. NTA", "Yeah, YTA in a huge way. I get that this must be really difficult and frustrating for you, but your son is only 4. He isn\u2019t being an asshole. He needs help. You have clearly described how that help is currently out of reach, by absolutely no fault of his own, and you still chose to punish him severely for behavior that is outside of his control.", "I understand the struggle with this and the frustration of dealing with difficult behaviors. Not that it is the cause, but just a suggestion to review any medications your son is taking to see if it might be a cause. A friend recently found her son\u2019s asthma medication was causing angry outbursts that have resolved simply by stopping the med.  Years ago my son was prescribed Miralax for constipation issues. He took it off/on for several years and after much frustration and heartache we figured out his outbursts were related to the med. Despite many parents reporting similar reactions, it is still not listed as a potential side effect.", "Let us know how his behavior improves after this. \ud83d\ude44 YTA", "NTA, I understand that you are tired and at the end of your rope. I am afraid that it will take some time to see an improvement of his behaviour. This should also be fun for you.  How can you be sure he will behave at the monster jam. You should also protect yourself, so you can be the parent you want to be.", "YTA I spent the whole time reading this expecting that you were talking about a teenager acting out in school.\n\n This is an outlandish punishment for a 4 year old acting out in school. \n\nThe difference being one can be expected to know how to behave themselves the other is actively still learning how to behave themselves and you are supposed to be the one teaching them.", "I\u2019m saying YTA, you said he is being referred for therapy meaning he has issues. My daughter will be 4 in June and has sensory and behavioral issues and is on a waitlist for an autism evaluation. You have no clue what is going on with your son or why he\u2019s acting out. I agree with your husband that it was too extreme", "NTA because you recognize the severity of your son\u2019s problems and are actively seeking professional help.  You also sound overwhelmed, you are mostly a single parent to an angry difficult kid.  I will say this- your son may respond better to smaller short term goals and rewards.  Something like, if you get mad and go to your safe room instead of breaking things and hurting people, then you get ice cream after dinner.  He\u2019s young, vague demands to behave better for a long time for a reward far in the future is hard for him to understand and achieve.  A reward each day he doesn\u2019t behave really bad, along with praise and recognition for improvement, may help.", "My son has been going through some things too.  He's pediatrician and counselor suggested seeing someone in neurology.  It's hard to get appointments right now.  So, you're going to need to be very proactive.  I've had to call everyday to get him evaluated. ONe place it's an 9 month wait.  But, keep at it. Also, look through his school.  He may be able to receive services through them.  Your child is in desperate need of help.", "YTA", "Maybe the Monster Jam is isn\u2019t appropriate entertainment for a 4 year old. The dad probably wanted to go and got a ticket for the kid. Two birds with one stone.", "YTA. This child needs help, connection, and patience, not punishments suited for a teenager. This only served to make you feel like you are doing something, while pushing him away. While you wait for the counselor, apologize for doing this to him, make a plan that is based on reinforcing good behavior, and spend more focused fun/relaxed time with him so starts to care what you think and trust again.", "YTA, but so is your husband. This kid is 4 years old and very obviously needs therapy, and instead you chose to go nuclear with punishment. Your husband has no right to say a thing, you\u2019re essentially a single parent.", "NAH. It\u2019s really really hard in a small town to find mental health help especially for a child, especially for a child so young. I read the edits about trying to find help & being waitlisted. I don\u2019t think your husband truly understands the depth of the issues you\u2019re describing & while it\u2019s not his fault he has to work so much & so far away, he does need to hear what you & his teachers are saying & understand that his child is not okay. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to bring my child that is being so unpredictable to an event like that regardless. \n\nAlso, take of yourself, maybe your partner needs to take one of his days off to take care of your child so you can have a break. You can\u2019t help your son if you\u2019re at your wits end.", "I read your edits and think you should be looking into virtual options for a consult to get this expedited. His behavior at 4 years old reminds me of my autistic kid. \n\nNTA for selling the tickets only because you told him that would be the punishment. You can\u2019t stare a punishment and not follow through. But I recommend talking to your husband in the future about punishments. \n\nI used to tell my kids I needed to talk to their dad and then we would tell them what the consequence would be.", "You don\u2019t get to do this without talking to your partner in life what is wrong with you? YTA", "NTA \n\nEveryone is blowing this way out of proportion, with implying this has mentally scared him and whatnot. You should have, however, talked with your spouse as well, but insisted on going through, because, unfortunately, he is an absentee father and doesn't have much interaction with him (honestly, this might would cause more mental anguish than the tickets being sold).", "YTA - a kid his age is not really old enough to connect the way he behaves at school to something like going or not going to Monster Jam - they are just two very separate things in his mind.\n\nThat all being said, he's also 4 - so while he might remember this and be upset for a while, he's not likely to hold a grudge for it, especially if monster jam is something he's able to go to in the future.\n\nNegative behaviors take a long time for kids to work through. Kids frequently are on behavior plans in school for years, so the idea that telling him he could not go to monster jam if the behaviors didn't get better is very naive.", "If the child isn't behaving well at school what's stopping them from behaving horribly at monster jam? A crowded place that's loud and high energy it's a good idea for a child already having issues in a classroom setting. Not only that but it'll disturb the other attendees. \n\nNTA for canceling and reselling the monster jam tickets and I'm glad you're looking into more resources to help your child. With that said I do agree with the others that immediate consequences like losing time of electronics, or time out, and what not could make a better impact on behavior changes.", "I\u2019m also wondering how many hours a day this child is spending at school and what the program looks like.  Is it okay-centered learning, or is it more typical of what kids used to do in 1st grade?  Some children do not do well with all-day programs and need it to be reduced to a half-day or even two hours.  He\u2019s only 4.  His behavior suggests he needs an adjustment made if he is spending a significant amount of time at school. (Speaking as the stepmother of a child that started school later with all three parents in agreement that he wasn\u2019t ready earlier.)", "No that\u2019s not how kid\u2019s brains work at that age.", "No it is not. 4 year olds have very little self control and can change a lot in a day. Heavy consequences, especially arbitrary and unrelated ones are not effective at that age. If she doesn't want to go, fine, but using the tickets as punishment for behavior out of the kid's control is not a wise move.\n\nNAH.", "NTA, I agree. Maybe the choice to take the tickets away was harsh, but I\u2019ve always found with kids it\u2019s \u201cmean what you say and say what you mean\u201d. Like yeah maybe there was another way, but OP gave the kid a consequence and then followed through with it. And the husband is ridiculous imo. It sucks that he works so much, but OP is basically full-time solo parenting if he\u2019s gone 6 days a week for an average of what 11 hrs a day? And apparently sometimes stays overnight at job sites. When kids go to sleep early so he\u2019s maybe getting to spend at most a few hours with kid if he works something like 6 - 7 shifts and is able to come home. OP made a call, which is perfectly reasonable.", "Um no. You don't get to make big decisions unilaterally as a parent. You are a team. Period. Full stop.", "100% agree. NTA OP", "Nonsense, parents communicate, partners communicate. There was no urgency to making that decision.", "Even if this were true for most 4 year olds (it isn't) it clearly isn't likely true for OP's 4 year old. The kid clearly doesn't have the behavioral and emotional maturity to handle being at pre school for a full day and you expect that he can grasp the idea of a consequence of losing a trip to see monster jam due to school behavior? That's inane.", "Yeah, I agree!! This is a tough one. I have a son exactly the same and frankly have done similar tantrums at home. Thankfully, not at school.  \n\nA few times, we have in extreme cases given multiple day punishments, basically no screen time, no desert, etc. \n\nHe does remember them and talk about the incident and talks about how he got angry and will try not to do it again. \n\nDefinitely not too young to understand. NTA.", "...he's four and frustrated, of course he said he didn't care.\n\nChrist.", "Complete agree, I was super shocked that he's 4. I expected 14 for this kind of consequence!", "and it certainly isn't developed enough to have a long term goal influence behaviour.    \n\n\nAs Dr Greene says \"kids do well if they can\".", "This needs more upvotes.", "My son is autistic. He didn\u2019t learn consequences or cause and effect until he was a teen.", "> the part of him that can stop a behavior because of his understanding of consequences is not developed enough\n\nare you saying 4 year olds don\u2019t understand how consequences work and aren\u2019t able to stop behaviours because of consequences? because that is *entirely* untrue.", "Fuck that; the earlier you introduce consequences to the child the better. Honestly this isn\u2019t even about the tickets; the husband works too much. If he\u2019s the provider than the wife needs to find a way to curb this because the dynamic they got right now is mot working. Even worse, the husband is a dick that literally doesn\u2019t see how bad the situation is.\n\nOP you did the right thing; at 4 they hardly remember shit anyway.", "You don\u2019t conference every decision just because you say the word \u201cteam\u201d. Being a team means backing each others play, not asking for the others permission.", "Yes, exactly, that is what \"take your kid with consistent and unusual behavioral issues at school to get evaluate by a professional\" means, obviously. /s", "Maybe there is a reason for it. She waits for counseling. Maybe her son should also see a doctor for evaluation in regards to ADHD or autism. Maybe being in a class is just too much (to many people) to cope. You can tell him what you want, when it's too much it's too much. \"I don't care\" might be a coping mechanism because punishment hurts in such a way, that the kid already tries to tell himself I don't care. To protect himself against everything he got told about doing wrong all the time. By now his self-esteem is probably quite low. He knows his classmates are better behaved, believe me. \n\nSo I understand why OP reacted this way, coping alone all the time. But maybe it is a learning experience for her, too. What consequences do I really use? Is it better to sleep over bigger decision because I am rather short tempered over this? Where can I get help ( for me and my son)? How can I still have a good relationship with my son? How can we spend quality time together (to build trust, good memories, self-esteem)?\n\nI am sure it is tough. Wish them all the best and hope their son gets checked thoroughly, so the know how to help him.", "I think trying to diagnose medical problems by means of a reddit post is not a winning solution.   \n\n\nIt's possible it's medical. Even so, the first step is, take child to a properly qualified chidl therapist, who would be able to steer parents in the direction of tests.   \n\n\nEither way, taking away the tickets to monster jam is a hellish overkill for a 4-year-old's behavior, and while I'm genuinely sympathetic to OP's difficulties, that's still my judgement.", "Lol absent father who\u2019s actually worse than absent by gaslighting and undermining mom is the main factor for the toddler\u2019s misbehaving. Punishing the toddler for that is psychopathic. Don\u2019t have kids", "No, she didn't. A 4-year-old won't put that together.

And it is normal for some kids to have delayed development in that area. Especially kids that struggle with emotional regulation. \n\nI teach 6yr olds and a decent amount of those still struggle with understanding consequences.", "Research says otherwise. They are often unable to think in the moment that \"I'm doing a bad thing, I need to stop or there will be X\". They will understand consequence after the fact, \"I hit my friend, so I need to sit in timeout\", however the consequence has to be pretty immediate, and directly connected.", "I agree.", "I think you are thinking of dogs", "What the hell are you talking about. A punishment is a punishment it isn\u2019t delayed it happened right there and then.", "Right they said big decisions, not \"every\" decision so you aren't correcting them like you think. \"When your [other parent] gets home they and I will have a serious discussion about what your punishment should be.\" That's team work. \n\n\n\nAnd if your partner or spouse is unable to hold you accountable when you are in the wrong on a poor parenting decision or moment, well that's not a very good team.

The child was told in plain English. I remember when they said if parents spank their children they will grow up to be violent adults. What a joke. Just the opposite is the truth.

Most of this \"new\" stuff is pure BS and the results are coming back to bite parents everywhere.", "The dad can keep an eye out for jobs that might be a better fit in terms of time, or closer to home so he's not losing 2hours a day to commuting...

Natural consequences is actually very effective for kids.", "It\u2019s a delayed punishment as he\u2019s not going to connect losing monster jam to the actions because monster jam wasn\u2019t happening for days after the final incident. He\u2019s not developmentally able to connect not going to monster jam with his behavior at school. For young kids consequences have to be immediate and match the nature of the incident. Kids that age don\u2019t have the reasoning skills to think, \u201coh I lost monster jam because I was bad at school.\u201d The consequence of her getting rid of the tickets and his behavior happened too far apart. He\u2019s not going to connect the two.", "She never should have tied the tickets to his behaviour. It feels very logical and clear to us but at 4 he isn't capable of thinking that far ahead. It's not even about being an AH (I'm sympathetic to how overwhelming her situation is), it's just not effective. He's not going to have that link of cause and effect of the behaviour and consequence that you did. Often around the holidays parents use Santa bringing coal as a kind of threat of punishment, but they don't do it in February! If punishment was appropriate here (and it sounds like the kiddo might be overwhelmed and not fully capable of controlling himself, I don't think we have enough info to know if punishment was helpful or if he needs medical intervention) then it should have been something immediate, like a timeout, not being allowed to watch tv or play a game, etc.", "She should have never used the tickets as a consequence.", "I work with kids who have a ton of emotional dysregulation going on and have seen so much improvement in them. OP could also buy the emotions spot books! There have been studies done that show they really do help", "I think the idea is that they CAN understand, but they don't always have the emotional regulation to consistently put that knowledge into action.\n\nSome kids may be able to so, most probably can a lot, but most will occasionally have a moment where they are so in their feelings that they can't think through and stop themselves in the moment, even if right after they acknowledge their error and accept their consequence.\n\n(Not to mention issues like ADHD, where you can expect a kid's self-regulation to be about 1/3 behind that of a peer...  so a 4yo's behavior will look more like an almost 3yos...  but they won't diagnose a kid till they're 6 usually...)", "I mean, I don't think it's the greatest punishment choice either. While kids as young as two can understand cause and effect, this specific example may be overly complex (though mom did repeat the warning enough that a more advanced four year old may get this). Also I get the feeling dad was looking forward to it as a bonding experience. \n\nI still hesitate to call it abuse though. That's a word with big implications and if we start to use it for telling a child that they can't do or have that thing they wanted, it starts to lose meaning. When you equate telling your kid they can't go to the show anymore with spanking, you aren't making the first action seem worse. You're making spanking seem not as bad as it is."]}
