{"id": 11459, "submission_id": "11i29tc", "title": "AITA for getting rid of my son's tickets", "selftext": "It's been since November my son (4) has been asking to go to monster jam. We bought the tickets about a month ago, and my son has been so excited ever since. For the past two weeks he's been having terrible behavior issues at school, we've gone through this once before and found some coping skills to help him settle down but all the sudden its gotten so much worse. My husband works 6 days a week and it can be anywhere from 8-14 hours a day so he's rarely home, and doesn't really see any of this. I've consistently talked to our son about needing to change his behavior at school and have tried to help him with better ways to handle his emotions, but he doesn't seem to really care. I feel this is probably where things started to go wrong, but I told him he wouldn't be able to go to monster jam if I kept having to pick him up early or get bad reports at the end of the day.\nI finally was at the end of my rope the other day when I came to pick him up and his teacher told me he stomped and broke his glasses that we only got him a week ago, and he almost pushed a desk on to another child. The whole day they struggled with him and he kept telling them he didn't care. Once we got home I told him he's not going to monster jam and I got online to resell the tickets since there's no refunds. My husband had to stay the night by a job so he wasn't going to be home that day or night. When we finally got to talk on the phone he was furious I would do this and said how horrible it was of me because our son has been looking forward to this for months and he says its too serious of a punishment for a 4 year old (he'll be 5 in July). The tickets sold almost instantly so there's no getting them back now, and my husband doesn't even want to speak to me. I'm sorry for this being so long and kind of all over the place, this has just been so draining and frustrating. Am I being the asshole in this situation, or do I need to do some apologizing?\n\nEdit: I'm realizing I probably should've mentioned that we do have a recommendation for a counselor and are just waiting for them to have an opening. Also, the event was this weekend. I really do appreciate all of the input and want to learn from this\n\nAnother edit since there's a lot of comments and I can't respond to them all individually: We have spoke to his doctor and did get the recommendation for therapy but we have to wait, its the only pediatric therapy center we have that isn't almost 2 hours away. We have a safety plan in place at his school where he has a safe area to go into where there's some soft stuff he's able to hit or throw to get the angry feeling out then come back out to talk to someone so we can talk through his feelings. I would never ever spank or hit my child. We also don't yell at him and have been working really hard to get him different ways to communicate his feelings with us. We are still going to do a family activity so that we can all be together but it'll be something closer to home. I have definitely apologized to him as well. I do agree I shouldn't have made a decision so hastily and without speaking to my husband first. The comments saying my son will hate me and go to therapy for this then never speak to me seem a little much as this isn't something that happens regularly, and I want to continue learning how to parent better\n\nProbably the last edit to add: I really appreciate every bit of advice I've gotten and want to do what I can to do better in the future. There's a lot I've been told here that no doctor or teacher has said, so I've got a lot more learning to do. I've ordered a few of the books that have been mentioned. I've also emailed his teacher to have a meeting on Monday to discuss all of the options we have and discuss if there are certain times, or things happening that set off these tantrums. He goes to school Monday-Friday 8:00am-2:30pm and I'm wondering if that is just too much for him, so its something I wrote down that I can bring up to his teachers as well. Resources around here aren't very good, so I'm realizing now that I need to push harder to make them available for him because I'm his only advocate to get help. I also need to see my own therapist to give me some better tools as well. I was able to finally speak to my husband in person as well as I haven't seen him since Thursday and it's now Saturday. We've had a discussion about his work hours and him needing to make an effort to be more present while at home and try to be there for his school activities. \nWe spent the day doing some cool science experiments and he told us that science was better than monster jam so I'm hoping he won't be too upset with me for long. I've also apologized and explained that sometimes mom gets upset and overwhelmed just like he does. This is the first time this type of punishment has ever happened and after giving time to think on it I'm disappointed in myself how it was handled because it's something my parents would've done and it's not how I want to be with my son. I know it's too late to take the punishment back and what it has done, but I really truly do want to learn and grow from this and be better for him. I do love my son more than anything though and that is something we talk about daily that mom will always love him no matter what's happening and I would never intentionally hurt him", "created_utc": 1677944658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i29tc/aita_for_getting_rid_of_my_sons_tickets/", "score": 922, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might have been better to say that he would have to go an entire week without intentionally breaking anything, hurting someone or yelling at people. That would give him some specific things to work on, and you would be able to praise him for improving. He should still face consequences for the things he is doing wrong, but I\u2019m assuming some of those consequences are happening at school?", "NTA-I find it amazing that so many responses are just looking for an excuse to remove responsibility for the bad actions of the child. The child was warned this could happen and chose to behave badly anyway. Actions come with responsibilities and reactions. Next time he'll think about what he can lose before acting out. He could have seriously injured another child but no one mentioned that problem. Too many no longer teach children right from wrong. Then they wonder why their children become irresponsible adults that commit crimes.", "NTA.\n\nWhile 4 is young it's young enough to know that special treats require a modercrum of good behavior. Your son when told that if he kept having reports and bad behavior it could cost him this special treat he said he didn't care.

However, he's 4. If he's having this behavior consistently, it needs to be addressed - especially because he responds to correction with \" I don't care\". There's something going on with him.

It's not it's a 4/5 year old.\n\nWhile you absolutely need to give your child clear consequences canceling the monster truck event probably won't have any lasting effect.\n\nA better way would be to tell your son \"if you misbehave at school no TV when you get home\" or some other consequence that is easy to enforce every single day, not a single day event. \n\nA 4/5 year old is going to struggle with coping skills.

And I hope your husband can be more of a driver than a passenger.", "That is a pretty big punishment, but it was in response to some pretty big behaviors.

He's 4. \n\nTo start, this is not how you discipline a 4 year old. They go into time out in the moment. They don't have the processing power to link school behavior to a later extracurricular event.\n\nSecond, if he's systematically misbehaving in school it's likely not a question of willpower. There's more likely something going on with him that you're not fully investigating. Have you had him evaluated by a professional yet? It's entirely possible you are punishing him for things completely beyond his power to control.", "NTA for following through, but I'm concerned about him showing these behaviors within the past few weeks. What has changed recently? Look into the following:\n\nIs your husband working more? Has your son's schedule changed (less sleep, more sugar, watching shows that he shouldn't, spending more time with relatives instead of at home)? \n\nIs there a new kid in school that he isn't getting along with? Did the teacher change the classroom routine and he doesn't know how to adjust? Does someone get to the block station every day before him and he's mad that he has to play with the kitchen station? \n\nAges 2-4 is an unfair age to kids.

If you think that punishment was appropriate, you need help parenting, too.   \n\nIt's hard to parent when your s/o is working all the time.

(using words instead of physically breaking things.)", "I don\u2019t think this is an age appropriate punishment - no matter how many times you may say the words, he\u2019s not old enough to comprehend a tangentially-related punishment **is** a punishment for his behaviour. The two things just don\u2019t connect. Time outs, teaching him to respect his belongings and to not hurt other people, are what is needed here. I understand that you don\u2019t want to reward a child who is acting out, but you\u2019re not teaching him anything with this - and you\u2019ve also deprived your husband of something he was looking forward to, and levied a huge punishment without his input. YTA.", "NTA, if it had been a one time thing with an impulsive threat, I would hope you would walk it back. This is an established pattern with an escalation and serious consequences.

Is the teacher short with him? Is it too loud? I agree with another poster about seeing a diagnosis as there could be other things going on. At 4 years old though, I think the punishment is way too harsh. He\u2019s still learning how to regulate his emotions.", "NTA, I think a lot of readers are glossing over the fact that you told your son you\u2019d take the tickets back if you kept having to pick him up from school for his behavior. I have a story, When I was four, I busted my lip after my mom REPEATEDLY told me to stop what I was doing & that I\u2019d end up getting hurt. Sure enough on Christmas Eve I had to be rushed to the hospital to put stitches in my lip. I will NEVER forget my mom kept telling me to stop and if I didn\u2019t it\u2019d be consequences. I just didn\u2019t listen. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know the consequences, & yeah he\u2019s four but I promise he knows better he just doesn\u2019t want to listen.", "NTA. Had something similar with my son at about the same age. His dad and I weren't together, but my son knew that if he was being punished at one parent's house, it carried over to the other. His dad was planning to take him to see professional wrestling. My son then had an incident at school and compounded the situation by lying to me about it. When his dad found out, he told my son he was no longer going to wrestling. Dad took a friend and son was with me that night.", "NTA.\n\nBut please get him checked medically. It sounds like there might be an underlying problem and he likely needs professional help to navigate through it.", "NTA, but it sounds like more than a tantrum. You may want to look at medical causes for the behavior swings if he is getting violent and can't control it. Ignoring it will not make him grow out of it.", "YTA\n\n4. He is 4. You said dad is rarely home.  All these behavior issues. Kids problems do not magically appear. You are in the process of getting counseling that is good. But age appropriate reward and punishment is needed. \n\nWhen you take your child in for well visits does the give you a list of things your child should be doing at 4?  Things like concentration for 10 min periods on one subject.  Picking up a toy when they are finished with it. Building a tower of 10 blocks high.  Knowing what your 4 year old should be capable of and not capable of will give you more reasonable expectations to what they can do. \n\nAnd my first thought is...how much sleep does your child get?  At 4 children should still be sleeping like 10 hours a day.  No one can function properly without enough sleep.", "NTA.  \nI was gonna ask for more info, but to be fair, you did warn your son you'd do this. Selling tickets for an event seems like a reasonable punishment, especially when your child is misbehaving and literally saying he doesn't care. You probably should've talked to your husband about this beforehand, but honestly, if he's not the one dealing with your son's attitude, then he shouldn't have a say in this.", "NTA.

What you just did is most definitely something that boy is going to bring up in therapy years from now over why he and his mom don\u2019t speak anymore.\n\nSounds like the kid misses his dad and needs more one on one time, not to be punished this harshly without even trying counseling first. Actions have consequences sure but these consequences were extreme and when it\u2019s something they\u2019ve been looking forward to for months there was definitely other actions that could have been taken first.

It's not about what you did, it's about when you did it.  For a punishment to \"sink in\", it has to be timely.  Extreme example.  Kid gets an F on his first-grade English exam.

Threw a brick through the neighbor's window, shaved your own pet cat, grabbed a can of red paint from the garage and dumped it all on the living room TV.  And that was all just his mid-morning warm-up.  Of course he is WELL AWARE that today is monster jam day.

Never went inside a friend's house, never on a school field trip, and especially never allowed to hang out with friends.

What do you think you've taught him by taking away the event he was so looking forward to? You've caused him to feel massively disappointed and resentful -- how is that going to equal behaviour? He obviously needs to see a counsellor -- and you just made everything much worse.", "YTA. He\u2019s FOUR.", "ESH\n\nI think it is useless to cancel the event, as someone said in another comment, because he will keep behaving badly. A negative consequence that can be enforced every day will probably have more effect.\n\nYour husband because he is barely home and I'm not sure how involved he is in his child school life, I don't think his opinion is very informed so maybe he shouldn't complain much and be more supportive, I'm not saying he should agree with you necessarily (because again, cancelling the concert wasn't really the most useful approach), but calling you horrible and refusing to speak to you is uncalled for.\n\nLastly, and I know this will be taken care of with the counselor in the future, at 4/5 years old I knew better than pushing a desk onto a another child (or onto anything really) and break my own things. Also this behaviour doesn't seem like a one time thing. I'm not sure to what extent this is a normal behaviour for a kid his age. Maybe there is something else going on?

We bought the tickets about a month ago, and my son has been so excited ever since. For the past two weeks he's been having terrible behavior issues at school, we've gone through this once before and found some coping skills to help him settle down but all the sudden its gotten so much worse. My husband works 6 days a week and it can be anywhere from 8-14 hours a day so he's rarely home, and doesn't really see any of this. I've consistently talked to our son about needing to change his behavior at school and have tried to help him with better ways to handle his emotions, but he doesn't seem to really care. I feel this is probably where things started to go wrong, but I told him he wouldn't be able to go to monster jam if I kept having to pick him up early or get bad reports at the end of the day.\nI finally was at the end of my rope the other day when I came to pick him up and his teacher told me he stomped and broke his glasses that we only got him a week ago, and he almost pushed a desk on to another child. The whole day they struggled with him and he kept telling them he didn't care. Once we got home I told him he's not going to monster jam and I got online to resell the tickets since there's no refunds. My husband had to stay the night by a job so he wasn't going to be home that day or night. When we finally got to talk on the phone he was furious I would do this and said how horrible it was of me because our son has been looking forward to this for months and he says its too serious of a punishment for a 4 year old (he'll be 5 in July). The tickets sold almost instantly so there's no getting them back now, and my husband doesn't even want to speak to me. I'm sorry for this being so long and kind of all over the place, this has just been so draining and frustrating. Am I being the asshole in this situation, or do I need to do some apologizing?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I was his age, I constantly got into trouble. Only my dad could realistically handle me and that was more because of our bond than anything else.\n\nWhat it sounds like is he needs to be evaluated, yesterday. He sounds chemically imbalanced and at his age, it's hard for him to regulate his emotions naturally. Coping strategies can and do help but often they aren't enough and he will still have bad days. \n\nIt's a rough road ahead, but know that with the right medical regiment and mental help, it gets better. \n\nAs for the punishment, frankly it's not going to help. That I promise. I'm not saying immediately cave, but you need more immediate punishments and you also need to communicate why those punishments are being given. \n\nAnd even then, I'd be lenient until he gets evaluated as he's not yet receiving all the help he should be.", "Was it the right approach given his age?

I do think you should apologize to your son. Also, there are so many options to help with some of the behaviors even before you get to a counselor. Not sure if you'll read this but I have been through this (my son will be 5 in june, we got evaluated last july and saw a behavioral therapist for a while after, which has legit been HUGE for us and his behavior), but inbox me if you really want some ideas on how to help save some of whatever sanity you have left.", "NAH\n\nthat shit is HARD. You\u2019re clearly doing the best you can to modify his behavior.\n\nHowever, it sounds like he has some very big emotions and is having a difficult time regulating. Punishments don\u2019t help.

Might want to look into that more before your son realizes you will never be his voice or have his back. \n\nI set up a meeting with the school and guess what\u2026 a psychologist who sat in even said the teacher was at fault for not following her iep.

Don\u2019t let the guilt eat you alive, I\u2019m curious how your son will act moving forward because of this punishment.

For 4 years old, we are talking about 4 minutes time out! Not canceling a one-time event!\n\nWe discuss with the child the behavior and not the child as a human. We actually don't say not even to an adult about themselves but about their actions.

I am sure you need it desperately.", "Dude, he\u2019s 4\n\nYTA\n\nEdited to add that I think I understand why our society is so screwed up after reading what so many parent commenters think of as \u201cage appropriate\u201d punishments.", "OP I'm not going to make a judgment because I've been where you are and I thought that I was drowning. Having a child struggling with anger and aggression is terrifying and overwhelming. I'm so glad you're getting into a doctor, we got my daughter into a behavioral development specialist when she was four and it helped so much. Here's a few things that helped me help my kid, who's now seven and functions well enough at school that the teacher was surprised to hear how far she's come.\n\nSimply on Purpose- it's a mom teaching positive parenting, which really helped me reach my kid. When she was acting incredibly aggressive it turned out that she was sad or frightened but didn't know how to express it. Positive parenting enabled me to engage with her to the point where we went from enemies to me being her safe place.\n\nThe Explosive Child - a great book with techniques for managing those kids with big emotions who lash out.\n\n1000 hours outside- instead of sports we do nature walks these days. It turned out that my kid needs about 2 hours outside a day to function. A thousand hours outside is a social media influencer that gives ideas about how to get out into nature. I can't stick strictly to the thousand hours because I make myself crazy, but otherwise it's very useful.\n\nSleep!- look up the Ferber guidelines for sleep at night. Most kids get way more sleep than they're getting. At 4 he should probably be getting 11 hours. It's a lot! But it's amazing how much better they're able to regulate themselves even they get enough sleep.\n\nGood luck.

Outside of all that, while a 4 year old can listen, I don\u2019t know that all of them universally can comprehend the punishment aspect enough to make me feel comfortable being that harsh. \n\nI do genuinely feel bad for someone who\u2019s basically single parenting a child who clearly needs help and simply has to wait for an open spot but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t also feel for your poor child. I would have certainly done a \u201clower level\u201d punishment since you haven\u2019t seen the therapist yet to know what struggles your son may have.

Maybe try more snuggle time before bed, or 5 minute morning and night talks about what he wants for the day/how his day is, as well as you telling him all the things you love that he did.

Red shirt or blue shirt today?\n\nInstead  of punishments work with rewards full 5 days of good at school stickers a trip to the park \n\nDon't make it all or nothing  if he makes a mistake and loses a day mid week if that whole week is wasted then why be good?\n\nModel behaviour where you care about other peoples feelings and talk things out \n\n Do not give him attention for bad behaviour, if he is acting out ignore him completely ( keep him safe odvouisly) but the thing is even negitive attention IS attention. Do give positive attention when he does the right thing make a big deal about it.\n\nFollow through ( like you did here) try not to state a consiquance you don't want to keep but if you do then follow through with them.... Otherwise your word means nothing.\n\nALWAYS do what you say you will even when it's tiny stuff.\n\nIf you have to pick him up do not let it be a fun day or a tv day.... He had to leave school well turns out this is the day you were cleaning so he can help , or you have to go to the boring store and pick out boring things, don't act like it's a punishment just oh well you didn't behave at school and this is what I do when your at school so now you have to come with me. \n\nValidate his feelings", "I'm gonna go with ESH.

And as the mother of a kid with regulation issues you won't fuck him up by choosing the \"do nothing \" option once in a while.

I highly recommend an actual therapist and not just saying you're planning on it.. or even a book on kids like him. I highly recommend the book \"raising your spirited child\" and really opening your mind to what it has to say, which flies in the face of a lot of super authoritarian parents.

I think you could perhaps read some parenting books--I hope that doesn't sound condescending, I've read a lot and it's helped me as a parent. At age 4, especially, consequences need to be natural and immediate. For example, if he pushes another kid on the playground, time to leave the playground. But losing Monster Jam just breaks my heart. I don't think it will permanently traumatize him or anything, but you took away something positive and fun and bonding for your family because he's struggling to behave. How sad. At age 4 he can't just flip a switch and be \"good.\" He sounds completely overwhelmed by the school setting. I recommend you get him evaluated and find a better educational situation for him.

Without immediate correlation to the behavior, the punishment has no effect. If he misbehaves at the dinner table, no dessert. If he plays too rough with another kid, time out.

He now has to help around the house more to \"pay\" for the glasses. Hurt another student? The related consequence for that should be isolation for bit, This one is actually good for this age now. 1 minute of isolation for each year of his age. So he's 4- four minutes.

Where it sounds like most of these outbursts are occurring from when she said that if she has to keep leaving work early and getting bad reports..their parents aren\u2019t there aka normal tantrums from a kid who\u2019s FOUR and missing his parents who he barely already sees bc daddy has a new job where he works a lot and mommy works too. This sounds like normal childhood behavior from a four year old - neurodivergent or otherwise.", "yta big time. hes 4 and you say he could be on the spectrum? yta for sure", "Lol at ppl thinking no monster trucks is abuse an traumatizing the kid probably shouldnt be seeing something so aggressive when hes already like that. I wouldn't want that kid around my kids he sounds aggressive an like he could seriously injure some one. Hes lucky he didn't grow up with my parents they woulda just whooped my ass for that shit. NTA tho your kid needs to learn consequences an your husband needs to be a real parent not disneyland dad who only does fun shit. I see you're waiting on people to help but you can't just let your kid get away with shit even if he's not typical or whatever people say nowadays. Ppl with mental issues still need to be accountable bc your going to be gone one day an hes gonna have to figure it out with out you there", "NTA. Dad needs to get a grip", "2 weeks of bad behavior at school with warnings that his monster jam show was on the line and then breaking his week old glasses, I would have sold the tickets too!! You don't reward bad behavior  NTA", "Please look into PANDAS if you notice that he gets more aggressive when he\u2019s sick", "YTA. Woah. 4!! My oldest went through this in pre k. She needed OT and counseling. A 4 year old acting that way cant help it and can\u2019t connect the punishment to the acting out. When he\u2019s in school he literally can\u2019t even conjure \u201cmonster trucks.\u201d This will help him internalize that he\u2019s bad and deserves not to have things that make him happy because he\u2019s bad. \n\nI know it\u2019s frustrating and you\u2019re at your wits\u2019 end, but he really can\u2019t help this behavior. Look up some stuff online for like sensory relaxing exercises to do at home, sensory input stuff like body socks and \u201cheavy play\u201d and work on that while you\u2019re waiting for an appointment.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t handle it well when my daughter was going through this stuff. She was hitting and acting out. And at home she was a pretty well behaved kid. She had tantrums and stuff, but she was never out of control for long periods of time, didn\u2019t hit us or her cousins. And she talked about school positively. Her acting out was a response to that environment and I wish I had been more educated about it when it was happening because she deserved better than how I initially responded, which was trying to punish her for something she couldn\u2019t control.", "NTA.   \nYour husband is never there and doesn\u2019t get to second guess your decisions.\n\nA 4 year old understands how to behave appropriately, and understands what punishment means.", "Yup there it is u don't spank or yell cuz you would NEVER. Lio EVERY SINGLE CHILD I've seen that is not disciplined properly (not saying abuse by any means but sometimes kids need to understand they can't keep doing something) yta to your kid", "YTA: This is just so mean. He's 4 years old. He cannot connect those tickets to his behavior as he acts. He can't do it. You're not punishing him to help him; you're punishing him to retaliate against him because you're frustrated. That's just...sad. Use immediate consequences and he's too long for anything long term. It's short term habits that your building. At 4 it's kinda like dog training. You don't take next week's park visit away from your dog for chewing your shoes. It's ridiculous.", "Never reward bad behavior. He didn\u2019t deserve to go and needs to know that there are consequences in life.", "Gentle YTA. A child that age that is having behavior problems is not able to control himself in the moment. I would be willing to bet the daycare teachers aren\u2019t helping the situation. This isn\u2019t his fault. \n\nPlease consider reading up on gentle parenting and following some accounts on social media that give tips on how to implement it in real life. Not gonna lie, it\u2019s hard to stay calm as a parent when your four year old is stomping things. But his feelings are just too big for his little body and his brain isn\u2019t able to regulate it yet. \n\nHe may need a therapist but you can start doing stuff at home. Harkla makes a lot of great products for kids this age to help them regulate their systems. Even a big crash pad would probably help him get out his need to smash into stuff.", "Honestly, just tell him you had to sell the tickets to pay for new glasses. Then his loss of monster jam is a real consequence he understands (\"you broke your glasses, and we needed to get new glasses, so we had to sell the tickets.\") and natural consequences like that are effective ways to punish a child when they are misbehaving at that age.", "NTA, you've got to stop the bad behaviour before he's gets old and becomes useless.", "You punished your child by taking away a good memory that you could have shared with him. You lost out on an adventure you can never get back.you have a limited amount of time the your son will want to do things with his parents. Bad choice for you and for him. Find a better way. Exercise always work for my son.", "INFO why is a 4 year old in school so much? What type of school is it?", "NTA \n\nMany people here are quick to YTA, but 4 almost 5 is a decent age. Especially with how kids are these days. They seem to hit milestones and growth a lot faster than back in the day. You are doing everything you can to help him manage. This action does not make you a bad parent. To those saying he\u2019ll need therapy, grow up. He will be just fine and will learn actions have consequences. He also learned OP will follow through on her words. If she still took him he would know he could get away with bad behavior.", "No, no theyre not. This behavior needs to stop VERY EARLY, otherwise these kids end up in the crisis unit of the er making life hell for all of us. \n\nParents, dont fear discipline, just remember that you dont need to over punish or you end up in that scenario as well.", "Parenting coach here, and a mom and grandma. You are 100% correct!", "And this is how he learns there are consequences. What's your solution? OP's NTA", "Actually, he needs his ass spanked lol. \n\nYou do bad things and the consequence is your ass becomes sore to the point where you cannot sit. That'll stop the bad behavior in its tracks.", "So what was she supposed to do? Take the kid to monster jam therefore rewarding his behavior? If she is repeatedly telling her kid that she will take the tickets away and then let\u2019s him go what does that do? I agree it\u2019s too harsh a punishment for that age but if she didn\u2019t follow through then he would realize her bluff.", "They do to a degree. They know if they drop a ball, it falls, if they push a friend over, the friend is sad. They can\u2019t control emotional outbursts. Think of how many adults you know who lash out when angry instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m pissed off because\u2026\u201d. It wasn\u2019t the understanding of consequences the kid lacked, it was ability to control emotions. I\u2019d say knowledge of the consequence probably worsened the behaviour because it added stress when he was already struggling.", "Thank you for saying this. Mine are grown, but when they weren't, the \"punishment\" was actually just a direct consequence of the behavior.  It meant that I had to get creative, and think fast, but it tied cause and effect together in a way that paid off.  I actually didn't punish much, at all.  I was pretty consistent in that if I threatened, I would do it. So the counting to 3 usually only made it to 2.", "This is an intelligent and reasoned response. Thank you for sharing your experience.", "Oh, yuck. Not worth refuting, though you might want to notice that the most notorious recent case of \"sucker-punching\" the elderly was the 75-year-old peacefully protesting for BLM who was brain-injured by the Buffalo cops. Maybe the cop's mom didn't spank him enough, is that what you think? As I said, oh yuck."]}
