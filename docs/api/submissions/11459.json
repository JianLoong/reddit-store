We bought the tickets about a month ago, and my son has been so excited ever since. For the past two weeks he's been having terrible behavior issues at school, we've gone through this once before and found some coping skills to help him settle down but all the sudden its gotten so much worse. My husband works 6 days a week and it can be anywhere from 8-14 hours a day so he's rarely home, and doesn't really see any of this. I've consistently talked to our son about needing to change his behavior at school and have tried to help him with better ways to handle his emotions, but he doesn't seem to really care. I feel this is probably where things started to go wrong, but I told him he wouldn't be able to go to monster jam if I kept having to pick him up early or get bad reports at the end of the day.\nI finally was at the end of my rope the other day when I came to pick him up and his teacher told me he stomped and broke his glasses that we only got him a week ago, and he almost pushed a desk on to another child. The whole day they struggled with him and he kept telling them he didn't care. Once we got home I told him he's not going to monster jam and I got online to resell the tickets since there's no refunds. My husband had to stay the night by a job so he wasn't going to be home that day or night. When we finally got to talk on the phone he was furious I would do this and said how horrible it was of me because our son has been looking forward to this for months and he says its too serious of a punishment for a 4 year old (he'll be 5 in July). The tickets sold almost instantly so there's no getting them back now, and my husband doesn't even want to speak to me. I'm sorry for this being so long and kind of all over the place, this has just been so draining and frustrating. Am I being the asshole in this situation, or do I need to do some apologizing?\n\nEdit: I'm realizing I probably should've mentioned that we do have a recommendation for a counselor and are just waiting for them to have an opening. Also, the event was this weekend. I really do appreciate all of the input and want to learn from this", "created_utc": 1677944658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i29tc/aita_for_getting_rid_of_my_sons_tickets/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you see this behavior at home or just at daycare? Do you notice any correlation in a spike in behaviors when his father is or isn't around or are the problem behaviors constant?\n\nIf these behaviors have been around for more than a few months, you may want to get a medical evaluation done to see if there could be something going on like ADHD or ASD that might be impacting your son's ability to self-regulate.", "Info: have you taken your son to a doctor? And why does your husband work so much? It seems he\u2019s neglecting his duties as a parent.", "I understand the frustration, but at that age you need to be pretty specific about the behaviors that he needs to change. It might have been better to say that he would have to go an entire week without intentionally breaking anything, hurting someone or yelling at people. That would give him some specific things to work on, and you would be able to praise him for improving. He should still face consequences for the things he is doing wrong, but I\u2019m assuming some of those consequences are happening at school?", "NTA-I find it amazing that so many responses are just looking for an excuse to remove responsibility for the bad actions of the child. The child was warned this could happen and chose to behave badly anyway. Actions come with responsibilities and reactions. Next time he'll think about what he can lose before acting out. He could have seriously injured another child but no one mentioned that problem. Too many no longer teach children right from wrong. Then they wonder why their children become irresponsible adults that commit crimes.", "NTA.\n\nWhile 4 is young it's young enough to know that special treats require a modercrum of good behavior. Your son when told that if he kept having reports and bad behavior it could cost him this special treat he said he didn't care.

However, he's 4. If he's having this behavior consistently, it needs to be addressed - especially because he responds to correction with \" I don't care\". There's something going on with him.

It's not it's a 4/5 year old.\n\nWhile you absolutely need to give your child clear consequences canceling the monster truck event probably won't have any lasting effect.\n\nA better way would be to tell your son \"if you misbehave at school no TV when you get home\" or some other consequence that is easy to enforce every single day, not a single day event. \n\nA 4/5 year old is going to struggle with coping skills. Have you had him evaluated? He might have a reason simply telling him \"no\" isn't working. \n\nGood luck OP I hope you find a way to get your son to act better. And I hope your husband can be more of a driver than a passenger.", "That is a pretty big punishment, but it was in response to some pretty big behaviors. Your son told his teachers that he \"didn't care\" that they did not like his behavior. Perhaps he at least cares about the loss of the tickets.\n\nThe course of action was set when you told him that you would not take him to the event if his behavior did not improve.

He's 4. \n\nTo start, this is not how you discipline a 4 year old. They go into time out in the moment. They don't have the processing power to link school behavior to a later extracurricular event.\n\nSecond, if he's systematically misbehaving in school it's likely not a question of willpower. There's more likely something going on with him that you're not fully investigating. Have you had him evaluated by a professional yet? It's entirely possible you are punishing him for things completely beyond his power to control.", "NTA for following through, but I'm concerned about him showing these behaviors within the past few weeks. What has changed recently? Look into the following:\n\nIs your husband working more? Has your son's schedule changed (less sleep, more sugar, watching shows that he shouldn't, spending more time with relatives instead of at home)? \n\nIs there a new kid in school that he isn't getting along with? Did the teacher change the classroom routine and he doesn't know how to adjust? Does someone get to the block station every day before him and he's mad that he has to play with the kitchen station? \n\nAges 2-4 is an unfair age to kids.

If you think that punishment was appropriate, you need help parenting, too.   \n\nIt's hard to parent when your s/o is working all the time.   But you really need to think more about the age of your kid and how important age appropriate discipline is.  \n\nYour kid doesn't know how to cope with frustration and anger.  It's your job to teach him appropriate ways to do that.    (Not by yelling or spanking, by the way.)     He needs to be able to express his anger in a healthy way without repercussions.    (using words instead of physically breaking things.)", "I don\u2019t think this is an age appropriate punishment - no matter how many times you may say the words, he\u2019s not old enough to comprehend a tangentially-related punishment **is** a punishment for his behaviour. The two things just don\u2019t connect. Time outs, teaching him to respect his belongings and to not hurt other people, are what is needed here. I understand that you don\u2019t want to reward a child who is acting out, but you\u2019re not teaching him anything with this - and you\u2019ve also deprived your husband of something he was looking forward to, and levied a huge punishment without his input. YTA.", "NTA, if it had been a one time thing with an impulsive threat, I would hope you would walk it back. This is an established pattern with an escalation and serious consequences. Your husband is wrong and has not had to experience any of the consequences of your sons behaviour.  He\u2019s old enough to understand serious actions have serious consequences.", "Info: Have you asked your son what is happening that makes him that upset at school? Are other kids mean to him? Is the teacher short with him? Is it too loud? I agree with another poster about seeing a diagnosis as there could be other things going on. At 4 years old though, I think the punishment is way too harsh. He\u2019s still learning how to regulate his emotions.", "NTA, I think a lot of readers are glossing over the fact that you told your son you\u2019d take the tickets back if you kept having to pick him up from school for his behavior. I have a story, When I was four, I busted my lip after my mom REPEATEDLY told me to stop what I was doing & that I\u2019d end up getting hurt. Sure enough on Christmas Eve I had to be rushed to the hospital to put stitches in my lip. I will NEVER forget my mom kept telling me to stop and if I didn\u2019t it\u2019d be consequences. I just didn\u2019t listen. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know the consequences, & yeah he\u2019s four but I promise he knows better he just doesn\u2019t want to listen.", "NTA. Had something similar with my son at about the same age. His dad and I weren't together, but my son knew that if he was being punished at one parent's house, it carried over to the other. His dad was planning to take him to see professional wrestling. My son then had an incident at school and compounded the situation by lying to me about it. When his dad found out, he told my son he was no longer going to wrestling. Dad took a friend and son was with me that night.", "NTA.\n\nBut please get him checked medically. It sounds like there might be an underlying problem and he likely needs professional help to navigate through it.", "NTA, but it sounds like more than a tantrum. You may want to look at medical causes for the behavior swings if he is getting violent and can't control it. Ignoring it will not make him grow out of it.", "YTA\n\n4. He is 4. You said dad is rarely home.  All these behavior issues. Kids problems do not magically appear. You are in the process of getting counseling that is good. But age appropriate reward and punishment is needed. \n\nWhen you take your child in for well visits does the give you a list of things your child should be doing at 4?  Things like concentration for 10 min periods on one subject.  Picking up a toy when they are finished with it. Building a tower of 10 blocks high.  Knowing what your 4 year old should be capable of and not capable of will give you more reasonable expectations to what they can do. \n\nAnd my first thought is...how much sleep does your child get?  At 4 children should still be sleeping like 10 hours a day.  No one can function properly without enough sleep.", "NTA.  \nI was gonna ask for more info, but to be fair, you did warn your son you'd do this. Selling tickets for an event seems like a reasonable punishment, especially when your child is misbehaving and literally saying he doesn't care. You probably should've talked to your husband about this beforehand, but honestly, if he's not the one dealing with your son's attitude, then he shouldn't have a say in this.", "NTA. He\u2019s definitely old enough to learn that actions have consequences. His actions are particularly bad. He will learn.", "Honestly, I\u2019m not sure, but for now NTA.

It\u2019s a tough tightrope to walk as a parent.  It sounds like you are doing the best you can.  Some of what you are describing sounds a lot like my son at 4yo. My son was diagnosed with ADHD at 6 and it\u2019s been a whole \u201cjourney.\u201d  And I can honestly tell you got way way better with certain types of support in place.  Wish you the best OP\u2014this shit is hard. Be as real and as honest with your husband as possible.

So YTA not for punishing your kid this way but by thinking your husband wasn\u2019t important enough to have input in this situation", "NTA. Son is old enough to learn there are consequences to actions. Enforcing this life lesson early on may save you further issues in the future.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to understand that his behavior needed to be improved. He was warned that he wouldn't get to go to Monster Jam if he didn't behave. If he can fixate on wanting to go to Monster Jam for months, he can fixate on good behavior to be able to go for a few weeks.\n\nMonster Jam happens often enough that he can go to the next one if his behavior improves.", "YTA.

Seems like a reasonable punishment to me.", "NTA. Rewarding children for shitty behaviour got us Donald Trump.\n\nSeriously, almost 5 is old enough to make the connection between behaviour and consequence, and I applaud you for removing something that matters to your child and will last in memory after warning him that the consequence would be there. He will remember that his behaviour was responsible.

At this age, whatever the problem is, is most likely out of his control (developmentally) and kids this age don't understand delayed consequences. They don't connect to any specific problem. So this doss NOTHING in the way of actual learning discipline.\n\nOmfg have you even had your kid assessed by anyone for developmental delays or diagnoses??? Or do you just assume he's bad? Wtf. Omg.", "YTA - but it does sound like you are struggling and just trying to do your best. It would be good if your husband could be more empathetic to the situation.\n\nI said YTA, though, because he is just little, 4 (or even five) feels too young  to really be expected to understand the link and there could be so many reasons for his school behaviors that might mean he's just struggling and perhaps isn't even ready for that environment.\n\nGood luck - I hope you and your husband are able to work through this in a way that supports each other's perspective where he also recognizes why you did what you did even if he disagrees.", "YTA. He\u2019s FOUR. They act up, have big emotions and are still learning. What you just did is most definitely something that boy is going to bring up in therapy years from now over why he and his mom don\u2019t speak anymore.\n\nSounds like the kid misses his dad and needs more one on one time, not to be punished this harshly without even trying counseling first. Actions have consequences sure but these consequences were extreme and when it\u2019s something they\u2019ve been looking forward to for months there was definitely other actions that could have been taken first. You also punished his dad by taking away something he was very likely looking forward to doing with the kid also and you shouldn\u2019t at all have made this decision yourself while mad.", "NTA if it was a one off incident maybe but it\u2019s ongoing and he needs to understand actions have consequences.", "YTA He's probably acting out so much because he doesn't hardly see his dad.", "Nta, but I will say you sound very understandably frustrated with your child. How much help has dad been with the behavioral issues since you mentioned dad works a good bit? Have you taken your son in see anyone in regards to the issues you are having? I'm sure some outside help would be beneficial if accessible.\n\nI'll say as well it might just be my opinion but you're never too young to learn actions have consequences. I do feel the punishment was age appropriate.", "Soft YTA.   \n\n\nI get how draining and frustrating and exhausting it is dealing with your son acting up like this, especially with zero help from his dad.  \n\n\nBut a 4-year-old doesn't behave like this out without a reason, and that reason is not, I guarantee it, anything within that 4-year-old's control.   \n\n\nThe reason may well be something that if he were older. he would cope with better or have more verbal skills to tell you about, but as it is, yes, while your husband should be doing more to help and I hate to give him the props, he's right - this is not an age-appropriate punishment for this kind of behaviour.   \n\n\nPlease, apologise to your son - try to explain to him how tired and mad you got and how you, like him, do things you regret when you are tired and mad: hug him and tell him you love him: and take him to a child therapist to find out why he's been acting like this. And figure out some thing he can go to as a treat to make up a bit for monster mash, okay?

Big punishment for big misbehavior.  You had talked to him about the ongoing misbehavior, you gave him consequences, you warned him.   Even at 4, he's old enough to understand that being a brat has consequences.  As for your husband, he doesn't have any room to talk.  He isn't there and unless/until he's an equal parent/partner he doesn't get to comment on what the primary parent does.", "YTA.  that\u2019s a big consequence for a little guy to learn from.", "When you told him originally that he could go, did you let him know that it would be contingent on his behavior? (in which case NTA) or did you decide to start holding it over his head after you had already told him he could go (in which case YTA)\n\nTelling a child that you will do something and then changing your mind and making it contingent on their behavior is not great for them for learning trust, which is then not great for their emotional well being and may not be as help with behavioral issues as you're hoping", "YTA.  It's not about what you did, it's about when you did it.  For a punishment to \"sink in\", it has to be timely.  Extreme example.  Kid gets an F on his first-grade English exam.  When he turns 16, he asks to buy a car.  You tell him \"NO\" because he failed his first-grade English exam.  (now what did that accomplish?????)\n\nYour monster jam punishment was not a bad idea, but the timing sucks.  For example.  The day of monster jam, little johnny is being a real terror.  Threw a brick through the neighbor's window, shaved your own pet cat, grabbed a can of red paint from the garage and dumped it all on the living room TV.  And that was all just his mid-morning warm-up.  Of course he is WELL AWARE that today is monster jam day.  So if you tell him that his behavior has caused you to give away or sell the tickets to monster jam....\n\nNOW it is a lesson learned!!!!  (Hopefully).  Crime and punishment.  Packaged together in relatively the same time-frame.  \n\nTo sell the tickets for a future date?  Just torture.  Not constructive punishment.  It will probably back-fire.  The kid will resent you and act out more now.", "YTA.

You two need to act as a team.", "YTA, you punished a four year old. 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Like he\u2019s a high schooler. You\u2019re in over your head clearly. First of no more kids if this is what parenting looks to you. Apologize to your son and then think hard about what you did. You don\u2019t think this will impact your sons long term feelings for you?

I don't speak to my parents anymore (in my 30s) and a lot has to do with not letting me go to things.\n\n\nEdit: I mean not allowed to go anywhere but school. Never went inside a friend's house, never on a school field trip, and especially never allowed to hang out with friends.

He obviously needs to see a counsellor -- and you just made everything much worse.", "YTA. He\u2019s FOUR.", "ESH\n\nI think it is useless to cancel the event, as someone said in another comment, because he will keep behaving badly. A negative consequence that can be enforced every day will probably have more effect.\n\nYour husband because he is barely home and I'm not sure how involved he is in his child school life, I don't think his opinion is very informed so maybe he shouldn't complain much and be more supportive, I'm not saying he should agree with you necessarily (because again, cancelling the concert wasn't really the most useful approach), but calling you horrible and refusing to speak to you is uncalled for.\n\nLastly, and I know this will be taken care of with the counselor in the future, at 4/5 years old I knew better than pushing a desk onto a another child (or onto anything really) and break my own things.

We bought the tickets about a month ago, and my son has been so excited ever since. For the past two weeks he's been having terrible behavior issues at school, we've gone through this once before and found some coping skills to help him settle down but all the sudden its gotten so much worse. My husband works 6 days a week and it can be anywhere from 8-14 hours a day so he's rarely home, and doesn't really see any of this. I've consistently talked to our son about needing to change his behavior at school and have tried to help him with better ways to handle his emotions, but he doesn't seem to really care. I feel this is probably where things started to go wrong, but I told him he wouldn't be able to go to monster jam if I kept having to pick him up early or get bad reports at the end of the day.\nI finally was at the end of my rope the other day when I came to pick him up and his teacher told me he stomped and broke his glasses that we only got him a week ago, and he almost pushed a desk on to another child. The whole day they struggled with him and he kept telling them he didn't care. Once we got home I told him he's not going to monster jam and I got online to resell the tickets since there's no refunds. My husband had to stay the night by a job so he wasn't going to be home that day or night. When we finally got to talk on the phone he was furious I would do this and said how horrible it was of me because our son has been looking forward to this for months and he says its too serious of a punishment for a 4 year old (he'll be 5 in July). The tickets sold almost instantly so there's no getting them back now, and my husband doesn't even want to speak to me. I'm sorry for this being so long and kind of all over the place, this has just been so draining and frustrating.

Positive parenting enabled me to engage with her to the point where we went from enemies to me being her safe place.\n\nThe Explosive Child - a great book with techniques for managing those kids with big emotions who lash out.\n\n1000 hours outside- instead of sports we do nature walks these days. It turned out that my kid needs about 2 hours outside a day to function. A thousand hours outside is a social media influencer that gives ideas about how to get out into nature.
