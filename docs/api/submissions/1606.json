I personally think he was being controlling AND insulted her by calling her greedy, and I still don\u2019t think that justifies her also insulting him.

You can eat whatever the heck you want whether pregnant or not.", "NTA. You've been growing a whole person and wanted some extra protein, salt and lipids. So the eff what?

By greedy I would assume he meant you were asking for more than your share, taking bacon away from him and the kid.", "Mt EX-husband used to say stuff like that to me and when I was trying to breastfeed would even go so far as to say \"are you sure you should be eating that? \" yeah, fuck that. Girl, you do you. Like others have said, he's projecting.", "NTA-  first of all he insulted you first by calling you \"greedy\" and then pulled some weird control move by telling you how much he was going to give you. So then you essentially clapped back at him and he had a hissy fit because apparently can dish it out but can't take it. I'm not sure why you have to make excuses for your behavior (difficult pregnancy,  feeling annoyed) as if it was your fault. What's his excuse for insulting you first? He's an AH plain and simple.

He\u2019s needs to be nicer.", "Eh...this is a miscommunication issue, not an asshole issue imo.\n\nHe could have just let you have more bacon if you're not rationing out due to cost/budgeting.

Who TF does he think he is controlling what his pregnant wife eats?!  \n\nMy husband would have given me what I asked for, and I\u2019m not even pregnant. \n\nProps to him for turning it on you and making himself the real victim here. \ud83d\ude44 don\u2019t put up with this.", "Gently cup his testicles in your dominant hand.\n\nLook lovingly into his eyes as you slowly tighten your grip, and say, \"I've heard other things taste like bacon when fried.

It\u2019s been a horrid pregnancy and literally all my body wants is salt (which is not good). I never used to eat like this before but ofc, pregnancy.

Those cravings are no joke. I definitely drove 20 minutes to walmart at 2am for a midnight blueberry craving more than once.
