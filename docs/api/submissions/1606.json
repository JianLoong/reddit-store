He was being incredibly rude to you.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA, unless you used the weight rebuttal as a way to spite him into feeling bad about his decision. Either way, I don\u2019t exactly see a problem with you wanting more pieces of bacon unless there\u2019s a shortage.\n\nIt\u2019s literally like a child asking for more water and the parent says no.

But you are wanting breakfast and you're wanting what you want. And you already have a 4-year-old you know you need that energy. So I would just let him know hey we can we agree to disagree and you know give me those extra two pieces. But I wouldn't say that you're an a******. A bit of a jerk for that comparison but definitely not a butthole.", "So he started off as being the AH, it is so unnecessary to refuse you 4 pieces of bacon and just give you two, but it is also as unnecessary to bring up the weight, people can be very insecure about that. So I'd say, you are both the AHs. \n\nEdit: You are not the AH for wanting more bacon, and he is in the wrong for refusing to give it to you, but bringing up his weight is an AH move.", "I\u2019m going for ESH\n\nYou know you\u2019re in the wrong for making a comment about his weight. A lot of your weight is because you have a baby inside you, an extra organ, more blood and probably some water retention in there somewhere. Your weight and his weight don\u2019t compare, and you didn\u2019t need to make the comment. \n\nHe\u2019s an AH though. Why can\u2019t you just have the bacon? Pregnancy is difficult enough to deal with without being refused the stuff your craving. Weight can always be lost after having the baby. 4 bits of bacon isn\u2019t greedy to have. He needs some chill. If he refuses it, just cook your own bacon next time, forget what he says.", "ESH. You're pregnant, and you should be able to eat what you want within reason to feed yourself and the baby. You are in the right about the bacon sandwich. But you lost the moral high ground when you brought up your boyfriend's weight, which you know is an insecurity for him.", "How many pieces pf bacon where there, I mean if there were 6 pieces of bacon  then he's right in saying your just greedy and need to share. If there is 10 or more than he's just being childish. But saying such a thing to somebody who is already body conscious is an AH move and could be damaging. \nSo YTA, he may be but you haven't given enough info", "I\u2019m going to say NAH - he shouldn\u2019t be trying to control your food and you shouldn\u2019t have brought up his weight but these don\u2019t seem like major issues (unless it has happened before and is actually some kind of pattern) especially when you\u2019re about to have another child together any day now\u2026 honestly you guys are probably just stressed out", "ESH he should\u2019ve given you the bacon.

Do you realize in reading what you wrote here that you can't win and he's setting you up to fail? He criticizes you for an action (not eating enough). You do the opposite and he criticizes you for that too. I hope you realize your behavior isn't the problem and isn't the point: his criticizing you no matter what you do is. \n\nYour readiness to apologize and take the blame also makes it seem like this might be a common dynamic between you two, where you need to be the one who's wrong or has failed in order to smooth things over. \n\nDoes any of this resonate with you my dear?", "He is def the AH for doing all of this, you two need to have a serious talk about it - he can\u2019t continue to do this to you.\n\nBut in that specific situation, you both are the AHs. Talking about those issues will help - in anger we say things we didn\u2019t want to say and they come off badly.

There was nothing wrong with you wanting 4 bits of bacon, and your partner should be celebrating that you can actually eat stuff now.
