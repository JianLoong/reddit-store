My sister \"Annie\" 24f is also pregnant with her second child. \n\nMy husband and I have been struggling with infertility for some time so when I found out I was pregnant I decided to wait until I was 3 months along before telling anyone in case I lost the baby. Luckily our daughter seems to be perfectly healthy and my husband and I are excited to be parents for the first time after trying to convince for so long. \n\nThe only problem is my sister Annie. My sister got pregnant a few weeks after I told my family about my pregnancy and I was happy that our kids would get to be so close growing up. So my husband and I were thinking of baby names and we both liked the name \"Molly\", which happens to be my grandmothers middle name. \n\nMy mom recently threw my sister and I a baby shower (we had a joint one) where I told her what we planned to name our daughter. She seemed surprised and told me that Annie was going to use that name. I told my mom that it was unfortunate but Annie had plenty of time to come up with another name. She begged me to pick another name since Annie had her heart set on Molly. \n\nI told my mom that I wouldn't budge and ended up leaving the party early to avoid causing a scene. After the party my sister called me and yelled at me for trying to steal a name that I knew meant a lot to her. (she's very close to our grandparents). I suggested that Annie could use one of the other names that start with M, like Millie, Miriam, Melanie ect. \n\nAfter that Annie and I decided to meet up for lunch to talk things over. But things got heated when I refused to change what I was gonna call my daughter. Annie cussed at me and left the restaurant which I thought was immature. \n\nI think this whole situation is ridiculous. She can't claim a name when she might not even have a girl. So Aita?.\n\n________________\n\nEdit: \n\n1) Annie named her first daughter \"Jessica\" she could have used Molly if it was that important. \n\n2) Annie is welcome to also use the name Molly, I just won't change my daughter's name as I've been calling her molly for months now. I only suggested that Annie should change her baby's name in response to our mom telling me I should change my daughter's name. \n\n3) I wasn't aware she planned to use the name Molly until my mother told me at the baby shower. She doesn't know the sex yet so I assumed she would be waiting until then to decide on a name. I also assumed she would use Joyce or Hannah after our mom if she had a girl. \n\n4) Plenty of disgusting people here wishing death upon my unborn baby.

Here is my suggestion: meet again and talk this out like adults. One can get it as a first name, one can use it as a middle. Both prepare good arguments why it should be you who should use it as a first name and then decide together.

You're telling me you had NO idea she wanted that name before your mentioned at to your mom? \n\nPersonally, I don't think anyone owns a name, and I don't care if cousins/friends/strangers have the same name as another.

That they will never run into, at any point during their lives, someone else with the same name? You can both name your child that. The world will not end.\n\nEdit: Let this be a lesson that you just shouldn't tell people the name until the kid of born.

I will never understand why ownership of names has become so important.  Name your child what you want, she names it what she wants.  If Grandma sits you down and tells you not to use her middle name, neither of you should out of respect for her.\n\nIf they share a name, so be it.

Is she going to pre-figure out the gender? \n\nHow about a compromise; they have the same middle name Molly. And you both choose a different first names.
