My sister \"Annie\" 24f is also pregnant with her second child. \n\nMy husband and I have been struggling with infertility for some time so when I found out I was pregnant I decided to wait until I was 3 months along before telling anyone in case I lost the baby. Luckily our daughter seems to be perfectly healthy and my husband and I are excited to be parents for the first time after trying to convince for so long. \n\nThe only problem is my sister Annie. My sister got pregnant a few weeks after I told my family about my pregnancy and I was happy that our kids would get to be so close growing up. So my husband and I were thinking of baby names and we both liked the name \"Molly\", which happens to be my grandmothers middle name. \n\nMy mom recently threw my sister and I a baby shower (we had a joint one) where I told her what we planned to name our daughter. She seemed surprised and told me that Annie was going to use that name. I told my mom that it was unfortunate but Annie had plenty of time to come up with another name. She begged me to pick another name since Annie had her heart set on Molly. \n\nI told my mom that I wouldn't budge and ended up leaving the party early to avoid causing a scene. After the party my sister called me and yelled at me for trying to steal a name that I knew meant a lot to her. (she's very close to our grandparents). I suggested that Annie could use one of the other names that start with M, like Millie, Miriam, Melanie ect. \n\nAfter that Annie and I decided to meet up for lunch to talk things over. But things got heated when I refused to change what I was gonna call my daughter. Annie cussed at me and left the restaurant which I thought was immature. \n\nI think this whole situation is ridiculous. She can't claim a name when she might not even have a girl. So Aita?.\n\nEdit: Annie's first child was a girl that she named \"Jessica\". If the name Molly was as important to her as people are making out, why didn't she name her first daughter Molly?.\n\nEdit 2: For everyone saying I should change Molly's name, I've been calling her that for months. I'm attached to that name and it feels wrong to choose another. I only implied that my sister should choose another name in response to my mother telling me I should change my baby's name. Annie is welcome to also name her baby Molly but I won't change my baby's name.", "created_utc": 1671566153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqxx6b/aita_for_stealing_my_sisters_baby_name/", "score": 726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here is my suggestion: meet again and talk this out like adults. One can get it as a first name, one can use it as a middle.

You're telling me you had NO idea she wanted that name before your mentioned at to your mom? \n\nPersonally, I don't think anyone owns a name, and I don't care if cousins/friends/strangers have the same name as another.

The world will not end.\n\nEdit: Let this be a lesson that you just shouldn't tell people the name until the kid of born.

I will never understand why ownership of names has become so important.  Name your child what you want, she names it what she wants.

Is she going to pre-figure out the gender? \n\nHow about a compromise; they have the same middle name Molly. And you both choose a different first names.

On the other hand my brother has it as a middle name. An argument could be made like a lot of people here are doing that my mom was obviously closed to my grandfather and so she had right for the name. But that is bullshit, it\u2019s your choice. And I hope you don\u2019t budge.", "Then that changes things, imo. She had the chance, it\u2019s unfortunate that you both came up with the same name. I have a little boy, but if he had been a girl and I didn\u2019t pick Opal like I\u2019ve always wanted and someone else did\u2026 to me that\u2019s on me you know\u2026 I had that chance\u2026", "Yes it's a consistent thing. Annie complained to our mom that she wasn't allowed a plus one at my wedding and my parents threatened to not pay for my dress. Then after that Annie got pregnant and relatives made snarky comments about my fertility.\n\nMy grandparents paid for everything for my niece. They bought her crib, her diapers for the first year, changing tables. They took Annie and her fianc\u00e9 on vacation ect.", "Probably because we're two different people. What I read was her mother implying that OP should choose a different name\n\nEdited to add that OP's sister later called to yell at her about the name, so I'm assuming sister doesn't want and has expressed that OP should change their baby's name", "No it doesn't. They might have named the first daughter after someone in the husband's sides of the family.\n\nOP doesn't know, she admitted it"]}
