Here is my suggestion: meet again and talk this out like adults. One can get it as a first name, one can use it as a middle.

That's such a weird coincidence!", "Just because they haven't told op the sex of the baby doesn't mean they don't know", "My baby is going to be born first. She doesn't even know the sex of her baby.", "I was supposed to be a Molly but my family members talked my mom out of it.

But it depends how close the family is and if nicknames are possible but clearly it's not very pleasant to be relegated to a number to be differentiated or to hear people say \u00ab\u00a0not you the other one\u00a0\u00bb. \nThere are so many names in the world that I do not see the point of giving the same name in such a small sphere :/", "I don't care if she also uses the name molly. It's that she doesn't want to share and cussed me out in a restaurant full of people.", "In fairness, it would be absurd for them to both name their kids the same name.", "I vote ESH because both kids can be named Molly. OP has no exclusivity claim to this name either.", "No, since Annie doesn't know the sex of her baby yet. I thought she would hold off on picking one until she knew if it was a boy or girl.", "I didn't know she wanted to use the name molly, plus she doesn't even know if the baby is a girl or boy yet. My baby is going to be born first and I don't care if Annie uses the same name.", "From the sound of it, OP's sister announced to their mother that she planned to use the name first, that's why OP's mother immediately reacted when OP told her.\n\nThat said, I think the best solution here is that neither of them use the name as a first name and instead maybe both use it as a middle name as an homage to the grandmother.", "The one thing for me is op sister doesn\u2019t know the gender yet. Why fight about this when it may not even be a fight for she could have a boy", "People can decide names without announcing them, I know plenty of couples who won't announce baby names until baby is born.

No problem.", "She has a two year old daughter that she picked a non-family name for. If she had picked molly then obviously I wouldn't have picked that for my baby's name.", "Don't yuck on someone else's yum. We're not here to pass judgement on the name itself.", "It's not impossible, but it can get confusing. I have a distant cousin (my grandpa and her grandpa were brothers) with the same first name as me and tbh we both always felt weird around each other and it leads to some awkward situations\ud83d\ude05 We live in different countries and have huge age difference so we were never close, only seeing each other once in a few years, so it's not a big problem, but in this situation they will definitely see each other way more and I personally wouldn't like to be in the position the Molly cousins would find themselves in but that's just my personal preference", "If we're going on first come first served, OPs sister told people about the name first", "I mean, they're naming the baby after grandma. So, no.", "Right. If granny had a super specific name that no one had ever heard I'd get being a bit more mifted about it.

There is soany names out there.\n\n\nI honestly think your both being ridiculous. \n\n\nEsh minus grandma.", "That's your answer. The only person who owns that name is your grandmother.\n\nImo the best thing to do is both use it as a middle name and pick different first names before the whole thing is ruined", "I love how you didn\u2019t answer the first question. Did you have any idea that your sister wanted to use the name Molly?", "This is what I think. Grandma is right. This is silly.", "Grandma seems to be the only one that\u2019s reasonable..\nESH but grandma.", "INFO: But did you know she would use it IF it were a girl and was in the choices just in case she is born a girl, or did you not know if she was going to use it at all? To me, not knowing the sex of the baby doesn't mean the name wasn't still predetermined ahead of time and then decided on officially later. And if they had been talking about it but said we still haven't confirmed till the gender is known, and you knew Molly was in the running for that, that changes my opinion here.", "Fair enough. I\u2019ll say NTA in that case. \n\nI\u2019ve known my sister likes our grandmothers middle name for a girls name for years, and so I\u2019d never use the name out of respect for her. Even though she may never have another baby and I\u2019m pregnant with a girl now. That\u2019s just my personal take on it though, it\u2019s completely different since you didn\u2019t know your sister liked the name though.", "If you're not a close to your grandmother as her, then why are you so set on naming your kid after her instead of letting sis do it? That's what I don't get.", "Does grandma\u2019s first name make people want to puke or something?", "Sounds like a her problem. Let a thousand Mollies bloom.", "Then why are you insisting on using it and telling her to choose another name? You are sounding quite selfish since the name has meaning for her other than it being a name she likes.", "We decided not to find out the gender of our first child until birth so picked out a name for a boy and a girl. My sister was due 3 months after me and found out she was having a boy. If she liked the boy name we picked, would it be right for her to take it since we didn\u2019t know what we were having?\n\nIn OP\u2019s case, neither of them knew the other had picked it. They both have the right to use the name they like, but hopefully value their relationship more than the name.", "That\u2019s what it seems to me as well. Sounds like from the start OP\u2019s sister had her names picked out for whether it was a boy or a girl!", "I think sister had her names picked for boy & girl from the start or even before pregnancy!", "If OP is 5 months pregnant and her sister got pregnant a few weeks after she announced at 3 months, that means her sister is probably no more than 8 weeks pregnant. Which means that she wouldn't know the sex. I found out early with mine, and that was at 11 weeks with genetic testing. The anatomy scan ultrasound, which is how most people find out the sex, isn't until 20 weeks.", "So it\u2019s not even because you like your grandmother or also have a special relationship with your grandma. YTA", "your actual problem is that it is your grandmother\u2019s name.  this means more to your sister than you.  it is a lovely name so i get it, but name your child molly knowing it will always create a problem because of the familial nature of it.", "Hey why don\u2019t you tell us this a few more times\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sunk in yet after the 7 times you\u2019ve said it, while purposely ignoring the actual question which is did you know *before* y\u2019all where pregnant that she wanted this name? Like for instance I\u2019ve had the name I wanted a girl since I was like 11 picked out, still want it, if I have a girl that will be her name(bf is onboard with it too he loves it) if my brother took it, I would be hurt and upset and lots of people would think me did it on purpose to be an ass\u2026 which is how you are kind of sounding\u2026..", "Maureen?", "If you did not know she was going to choose this name, I change my verdict to NTA. I wonder if other Reddit siblings have had this issue. \ud83e\udd14\nYou just have to ask yourself, how important this name is to you. Do you have dibs? Yeah, I think so, technically. But how will this effect your relationship with your sister, is it worth it? Good luck, happy holidays.", "Pfft, no.\n\nMy (half) sister and I both wanted to use my adopted dad\u2019s last name as a name for a son. I had a boy first. She never explicitly stated that she had more of a right to the name than me because he is her bio dad and not mine, and if she had, it would be a really douchey thing of her. And your sister is being douchey, too. This is her second kid, if she liked molly so much she should have used it already.", "If you didn\u2019t care why did you insist she use another name instead of saying you can both use it with no problem?", ">>I don't care if she also uses the name Molly. \n\nAnd yet... \n\n>>I told my mom is was unfortunate but Annie had plenty of time to come up with another name. \n\n>>I suggested that Annie could use one of the other names that start with M. \n\nThese statements don't track, especially since you were telling your mom Annie had plenty of time to pick another name BEFORE Annie was upset with you at the restaurant. You clearly do care, and think you called the name Molly.", "Really? They\u2019re sisters. The kids will have different last names unless she also stole her sister\u2019s wedded name. Cousins sometimes have the same name. Nbd", "Why absurd? They both like the name. OP knows she's having a girl and the sister may not be, but even so, there are plenty of kids who share names, even within the same family. This is not a new concept.", "Why absurd? I have five cousins, myself included with the same name due to being named after our grandmother. It\u2019s never been an issue", "I have cousins who have the same first name and a number of us have the same middle name. It's no biggie", "OK but, did she ever say, \"If we have a girl, we're naming her Molly\"?", "Well then expect to accept that some people \\[sister included\\] are going to call you an AH.", "That\u2019s never gonna work though.  OP does it, names her kid something else with molly as a middle name, what stops sister from naming her kid Molly?  There doesn\u2019t seem to be the trust necessary between the two to make that a viable plan", ">People can decide names without announcing them\n\nThis is true but I don't think you can really use it as evidence you had decided on a name unless other people are aware.", "All the grandkids in my family have the same first name, different middle names, and go by nicknames when we\u2019re around each other. It really isn\u2019t that weird.", "That would been called \"Calling dibs\", and you can't call dibs on a baby's name. The baby need to be born in order to \"claim\" the name.", "THIS! Op isnt answering any questions like that and the wording in their post is very Y T A. this is either fake or OP is definitely TA and is leaving out big key details", "No since Annie doesn't even know the sex of her baby yet. It could be a boy for all anyone knows.", "Sounds like she just wants to get one up on her sister.", "Right, if it's *not* that big of a deal, then why make such a big issue about it? Just concede and make pick something else. I have a dog named Molly, is that going to upset everyone too?!", "She might be having a boy for all anyone knows. And I don't mind if she also chooses to name her baby Molly, but that idea seems to bother her.", "Well yes all I was saying was her sister didn\u2019t know yet. For why fight about something when they don\u2019t even know they are gonna have the same gender. To me its not important.", "I can name my child whatever I want, I simply like the name molly, I don't need any other reason.", "If you read my comments I've actually answered that question. No I didn't know she wanted to use Molly. I thought she would pick Joyce or Hannah after our mom.", "Good point made there. Like, what\u2019s the big deal?", "Probably because she knows her sister wouldn\u2019t want them to have the same name.\n\nMe and my sister were in a similar situation. I was considering using a name she wanted to use, even though she wasn\u2019t even pregnant. I didn\u2019t care if she named a future kid the same name, but when she would make a big deal about it, I would also tell her she could pick a different name/had time before that was an issue for her.\n\nI ended up using a different name just bc I liked it better, but OP can be indifferent about two kids having the same name AND be aware that her sister (and mother apparently) are weird about it.", "Yeah if Annie didn't want them to have the same name.", "> Cousins sometimes have the same name.\n\nTHIS. In the culture I grew up in, parents name children after their parents/the children's grandparents (first born children always take names from the paternal side, second born children always take from the maternal side). This usually ends in multiple people in the family with the same name. By luck of the draw, my sister and one of my older cousins have the same name, both first and last, because my dad and my uncle both had first born daughters. No one cared about this, they were just excited about another baby in the family.", "There is one name in my family (not saying the real one because it's identifying, but let's say Michael) that multiple people per generation have.  Because they are men they also have the same last name too.\n\nI have three Uncle Mikes and four cousins if you count the Michaela. It's a running family name, just like Molly will be since they both got the name from a family member.  If everyone's name has to be unique then neither of them get to use it since their grandmother had it first.  \n\nNTA as long as you are happy with them both having the name and aren't also pressing your sister to change too.", "How do you not see that that would be insane lol", "It's possible for women to keep their names you know.", "Not to me. I assumed she's pick Joyce or Hannah after our mom.", "Yeah but OP doesn't mind if both babies are named Molly, the sister is the one who's upset. So it doesn't really matter if they announced it or not.", "I'm saying your whole logic is flawed", "I agree, OP is very sketch in this situation.

But did you know your sister wanted the name Molly if it was a girl? I feel like you\u2019re dodging the question.

After you saying the same thing numerous times, I didn\u2019t bother to read ahead, my apologies. In the end it is your decision and you name your baby what you want, just be prepared for any consequences just in case. If it has more meaning to your sister then it\u2019s mean that you would do that\u2026 but your decision. Your grandma is right though. I would take her advice, if this is about honoring and respecting her then listening to her words of wisdom are a good way to do that", "OP doesn\u2019t want to share, she\u2019s just tacking that on to make herself look better. If she was ok with both kids being Molly she absolutely would have suggested it to her sister and said so in her post.", "Yep.

Granted I\u2019m from a big family but, really, it happens. Nobody cares. They made it through to adulthood and beyond just fine. If it were some super unique thing and had been an open, lifetime desire from the one sister with the newer pregnancy maybe it would matter a little. Maybe. That is as much as I will grant", "OK so here is my judgement:\n\nIf you had EVER been conscious of the fact that your sister liked that name for a potential future girl, then YTA. It doesn't matter whether she told you directly or not. Even if you knew just because it had been talked about in your family. There are thousands of other names, I can't understand for the life of me why you'd choose the same name your sister wanted.\n\nHowever, if you honestly had never heard even a RUMOR that your sister wanted that name, then my judgement is ESH, because once you both found out it was both your choice of name, you should have worked it out with love and kindness.", "so you assumed Annie was going to name her baby after someone, but not your grandmother who she was especially close to? \n\ndid she ever say she was naming after a loved one, just not who? this is all very strange.", "Is it that bad if both girls have the same name? My mom had a cousin with the same name has her, and they loved being \"The Lindas\" at family events and it was never a problem at all. Can't they both be Mollie?  Is that really that bad? Not to mention, theres a decent chance one of them will end up naturally getting a nickname or maybe end up wanting to go by their middle name if they end up disliking having the same name.\n\nI just think of it like this: if naming one granddaughter after grandma honors her, doesn't naming two honor her more?", "There is no flaws. OP can name her daughter however she likes. Her sister too. OP's baby going to come first, and she has the right to write whatever name she pleases on the birth certificate.

If the baby was a girl I assumed she would have used Joyce for our mom.", "No if anything I thought she'd pick Joyce for our mom.", "It's not about being a tribute to my grandmother, it's about having a baby name I'm happy with.

Sorry you and your sister are at an impasse right now. Just have two Mollys? Hopefully it all works out in the end and CONGRATULATIONS to you as well.", "Why are you asking if YTA if you don\u2019t care anyway? If you\u2019re willing to just cut your sister out of your life over an argument it seems like you\u2019ve made up your mind and don\u2019t care what others\u2019 thing", "A name that does have meaning to her more than just liking it and probably deep down you knew that. If they are truly as close as you say\u2026 is her first baby a boy or girl. There is so many names out there, that\u2019s really the only one the both of you like\u2026."]}
