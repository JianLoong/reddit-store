However, weve had some trouble when talking about what to name our child. We had a lot of trouble finding good names that we both like, so we've gotten help from my family and my in-laws. However I tried excluding my MIL, whos named linda.  I wanted to exclude her because she is extremely catholic, so she has some very extreme beleifs and opinions. She had harrased a friend of mine for her sexuality, and she didnt leave her house for days after. She has a pretty long history of pushing her beleifs onto the rest of us. I was talking to my family, and then the perfect name came up. Jaiden. I had also received a text from my husband, saying he was daydreaming at work when he found out the perfect name. i was happy we had both found potential names, and that hopefully we would agree on one of them. We sat down on the couch, and i told him that i was thinking of naming the baby jaiden. He immedeatly shot it down, so i asked what name he wanted for the baby. He told me he wanted to name the baby Linda after his mom. I was fuming internally, I tried reminding him about what his mom had done to my friend, and other members of the family. he responded with \"She's christian, its just a part of her religion. you cant shame her for beleiving in god.\" I just wasnt having it. im currently eating leftover soup in the upstairs bedroom, as i need time to process this. however i do feel like i am the asshole because it is just her religious beleifs.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nAgain, sorry for my bad storytelling. my friends tell me that i write the same way a child does. however i dont think that matters, as long as you readers understand what i write.", "created_utc": 1675163258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pwbyo/aita_for_insisting_our_baby_not_be_named_linda/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
