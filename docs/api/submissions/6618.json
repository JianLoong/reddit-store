You\u2019re in the right to make that demand. \n\nI\u2019m a little concerned about the focus on alcohol and money - your uncle\u2019s an addict, and you want him to pay you for the stuff he consumed.

It turns out my mom and dad had both suspected it for years and never told me and this instance confirmed it.

He stayed with us for about two weeks and I only had gin from the two bottles in the kitchen once with my brothers, other than that they were in the cupboard in the kitchen.

Obviously it would be nice to get the money back but I don\u2019t think that will happen. What I want most is that he actually takes some accountability, because right now everyone is just enabling him. I want him to actually have consequences for his actions. I\u2019ve suggested to my parents that he not come over anymore, but they refuse that so I\u2019m not sure what else to do except to ask for the money back.", "NTA\n\nUncle is the biggest AH. Your parents are AHs too for telling you to drop it.\n\nSorry he drank it all. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be getting the money, but you\u2019re not the AH for demanding it.", "I agree, otherwise it would be very enabling. But I still hope OP gets the alcohol paid.", "If that\u2019s really your position, I wouldn\u2019t lean on the money.

I\u2019m not going to pretend it didn\u2019t happen, and if you do, you\u2019re saying that his comfort, or your comfort at ignoring his problem and enabling him, matters more than my comfort in your home, and in this family\u201d", "I completely get where you\u2019re coming from with your uncle taking accountability but the long term accountability needs to be his acknowledgment of a drinking problem which hopefully after this embarrassing incident will make him wake up to it, but I doubt he\u2019ll take accountability of what he did as then he\u2019d be admitting the bigger issue with the drinking problem and until he\u2019s ready to do that he\u2019ll downplay this.", "That\u2019s a really good way of wording it and I will definitely use that.
