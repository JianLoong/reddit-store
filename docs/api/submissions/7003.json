We have 2 kids (8 & 5).  My wife also has a daughter, Mary (18) from before we got together.  Mary is in her senior year of high school and lives with us.  She will go see her bio-dad 2 weekends a month, but due to her extra-curricular activities, it is not always an every-other-weekend thing.  Since bio-dad lives about 2 hours away, Mary works out times with her dad for her to visit him and she drives herself there.  \n\nThis past weekend, my wife took our 2 younger kids to visit her sister who lives about 3 hours away.  Before my wife left, Mary told us that she was going to visit her dad that weekend.  I was going to stay home to get some work done on some home projects that had been neglected over the holidays. \n\nSo, on Friday after everyone else had left, I kicked back and took advantage of the very rare opportunity of having an empty house to myself.  I bought a nice bottle of bourbon, visited our local dispensary, and bought myself a nice big steak. \n\nAbout 3am, I was awoken by a phone call.  Any parent knows that a phone call at that time of night is a nightmare situation, so I immediately answered.  It was my wife and she told me that Mary had been arrested and had just called her from our local jail.  Apparently, she had lied about going to her dad's house and had instead attended a party.  The party got busted and Mary panicked and tried to run.  Of course, the cops caught her and arrested her.  My wife said that the police would allow me to go get Mary right away instead of keeping her in jail.\n\nI told my wife that I had been drinking earlier and was probably not safe to drive, let alone drive to a police station.  I told her that I would pick Mary up first thing in the morning.  My wife yelled at me for being irresponsible by drinking to that point in case of an emergency.  I told her that I was home by myself and everyone else in the family was supposed to be hours away, so I essentially had zero responsibility for anyone besides myself.  She eventually calmed down enough to see my side.\n\nThe next morning, I went and got Mary right when I woke up.  When I saw her, it was obvious she had been crying a lot and she didn't say a word to me on the way home.  She immediately went to her room when we got home and didn't come out the entire day.  \n\nThe next day when my wife got home, Mary was still in her room.  My wife talked to her and then came to talk to me.  She told me that both her and Mary are disappointed in me that I made her spend a night in jail instead of getting her right away.  She said that Mary is traumatized by the whole thing.  I told her \"Good, maybe next time she won't lie and do stupid sh!t.\"\n\nI reminded her that Mary is an adult now and she has to get used to facing consequences of her actions and this should be a very clear reminder of what those consequences could be. My wife said that that lesson could have been made without making her spend a night in jail.", "created_utc": 1673383130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108kad6/aita_for_letting_my_stepdaughter_spend_a_night_in/", "score": 1526, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife was out of town and she called me at 3am to tell me that I can pick Mary up, but I had been drinking earlier and didn't want to risk driving to a police station.

Yes, obviously you make sense as the first phone call but once you acknowledge that yeah- you couldn't pick Mary up that night, you'd (reasonably) had too much to drink. Your wife should have said okay, Let Me Call Someone Else.\n\nWant to know why she didn't? Because everyone else would have said at 3am that it wasn't an emergency. Otherwise she'd have made the phone calls.\n\nEspecially when several of Mary's friends parents were probably picking up their own kids. Mary is 18- she's legally an adult (presumably.) She didn't need a parent to come pick her up, she just needed a person.", "NTA. If she was so traumatized by spending the night in jail, then why didn\u2019t your wife contact her actual father after you told her you were not sober enough to drive down bail her out? Surely two hours away it not too far when his daughter is in jail.", "NTA you didn't drink & drive, you thought Mary was somewhere safe, your wife & kids were together so why the hell not chill? My dude you are totally in the right here.", "NTA\n\nI don't see any part of this situation that would be improved by you showing up drunk and high to a police station in the middle of the night.", "NTA. What is your wife saying about her going to the Party in the first place?\n\nIt would have been wrong for you to drive intoxicated.", "This forum for the last several days has been filled with questions revolving around 18 year olds or around this age of crossing into the legal adult line. Always similar issue of the \u201cchild who is now a legal adult\u201d pulling some nonsense and then getting all offended when they don\u2019t get their way, etc. \n\nWhat your wife and daughter have to understand is that you didn\u2019t intentionally leave her in jail out of maliciousness. You and your wife planned your weekends accordingly because this 18 year old told you she was doing one thing (visiting her dad as she commonly does) yet she LIED TO EVERYONE, went to a place that she, despite being 18, legally should NOT have been hanging out at (going to assume there was alcohol) and then when she got CAUGHT, expects everyone to cater to her that had no hand in any of these matters. \n\nHopefully this was a \u201cone and done\u201d for her in the lesson-learning department - adult actions have adult consequences. Adults also have to fend for themselves, a lot of the time, and because they are no longer a child they no longer are entitled to be handheld just because they are crying. \n\nNTA.\n\nPS - I\u2019m really not trying to rub this in, but is it a fair question for me to ask - I know Mary is 18 and all, but when making a long driving trip alone to go visit her Dad, doesn\u2019t her mother ever say \u201ccall me when you get there so I know you made it safely?\u201d \nMy mother did this for as long as I lived at home (until I married at 25) no matter where I went back in the day simply because she wanted to \u201csleep at night knowing I was at my destination\u201d? My mother did this at a time when there were no iPhones in existence. Perhaps it\u2019s time to put the \u201ctrack my location\u201d feature back on Mary\u2019s phone?", "WTF! NTA at all. Your wife is an enabler, and the audacity to have her daughter tell you she was disappointed in you is so the charts disrespectful. Good luck with all that.", "NTA. What did they expect exactly? For you to keep your stepdaughter company in the cell for a DUI?", "If you had gone and picked her up and then lectured her about the underage drinking, I'm guessing she would have been all \"I'm 18, you can't tell me what to do!\"\n\nShe lied (which you had no way of knowing) so you had something to drink.  You didn't think you were in a safe state to drive.\n\nShe wants to be an adult, she can act like one and face consequences of her actions.\n\nIt was one night.  Sure, I'm guessing she didn't sleep well, but she survived.  Maybe she will learn from the experience.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  When faced with the choice between driving while intoxicated to a police station or letting your lying stepdaughter spend a few extra hours in jail for being irresponsible, you made the right decision.", "NTA You\u2019re allowed to kick back and drink when you\u2019re alone. And her spending a night in jail is a direct consequence of HER behavior. Maybe mom should worry about that instead of how you spent your free time", "NTA!!! Thank you for responsibly consuming alcohol and marijuana, and not driving impaired.", "NTA.\n\nHad you gone there, you'd have probably ended up jailed as well, lol. It's obviously better not to risk your safety or the safety of others than getting your daughter out of jail earlier. On top of that, let's not forget that she also lied to you about her whereabouts.", "NTA\nYou did the responsible thing of not drink driving. What if you got in an accident, what if you get to the police station and they noticed you had been drinking. \n\nLook it sucks for your daughter but her choices have consequences. Plus you didn't leave her there to teach her a lesson. You did it because you'd been drinking", "NTA. \n\n1.  You are allowed to have a night of and enjoy a whisky. Nothing wrong with that at all. You can\u2019t be constantly \u201con call\u201d incase you need to rescue your step daughter from jail again. \n\n2. It would be irresponsible to drive after drinking. You made the right call there. \n\n3.

Ask how \u201cdisappointed\u201d she is that her daughter lied to you both, and remind her how \u201cdisappointed\u201d you are in her that she seems to be blaming you for being responsible and safe. NTA.", "NTA\nShe lied, she has to deal with the consequences. \nIf she had told you she was going to a party instead of her dads, then it may have been different depending on other circumstances we don\u2019t know about (like drugs, alcohol (if underage) etc)", "NTA. My parents always told my sibling and me they wouldn't pick us up from jail for stupid shit like this. It sounds like they're mad at you for not helping shield an adult from the consequences of their own actions. Are you supposed to pay her fines or do her community service too?", "NTA, OP, I agree with everything you have said.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make her spend the night in jail. She did that to herself. You trusted that your step daughter was telling the truth when she said she was going to visit her dad.\n\nClearly that trust was misplaced. I think you should have a serious talk with your stepdaughter and your wife about that.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and spending a night in jail was a result of her own choices, not your fault.", "NTA---If you were stone cold sober you would have done the right thing. Maybe she will think next time.", "NTA - harsh reality from lying about where you\u2019re going to your parents, whether she\u2019s 18 or not.", "NTA and honestly probably need to have a serious convo with your wife if she's that upset with you but not the kid. Hopefully the night in jail is what she needs to remind her not to go down a bad path", "NTA you were 100% right with what you did.", "Nta\n\nYou did nothing wrong in the entire situation. You were responsible in all your actions, and you're right in that this will/ should teach her a lesson.", "NTA - you had no reason to believe you'd be needed, you can't not relax by yourself in perpetual fear of something coming up and you trusted everyone to be where they said they would be, hard lesson for her to learn but this one's on step daughter.", "Nta. If she had been honest and said she was attending a party, you could have stayed sober and on call for her to pick her up. She chose to lie instead and that was the consequence. \n\nI do wonder why she feels like she can't be straight up with you both about where she is and what she's doing. 18 is a legal adult where I live.", "NTA. \nYou didn\u2019t leave her there to teach her a lesson or be spiteful (and FWIW I don\u2019t think It would be horrible for her to sit one night in jail as a consequence regardless) you had her stay bc it wasn\u2019t safe for you and others on the road to do so. \n\nWould your wife have been less disappointed if you had gotten her right away and gotten a DUI? Or gotten into an accident. Let\u2019s put the blame where it belongs, in the partying teenager.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even know she was at a party and COULD need help. She lied and you thought she was elsewhere. \n\nNot your fault.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou were probably still high and drunk it was best you not went got her. You at home by yourself enjoying your alone time. It\u2019s not your fault your stepdaughter lied now that she seen what jail is like maybe she will do her best not to ever go back. If you would\u2019ve went up there still drunk and high they would\u2019ve thrown you in jail.", "NTA\n\nAre you supposed to just never touch alcohol ever *just in case* the daughter decides to do something stupid?  That's just plain unreasonable.  You might as well add in \"don't sleep or become occupied in any regard in case you need to attend to something else\"\n\nThat is a ridiculous expectation to have.\n\nAlso what does she think would be the result of you drunk driving to the jail?  They'd smell the alcohol, test you, and throw your ass in the can too.  She can't be this stupid... she just can't...\n\nAlso if Mary didn't want to spend the night in jail she shouldn't have lied to you about where she was going, and shouldn't have gone to that party, and shouldn't have run from the cops.  Literally 0 of that is your fault, and you could have *never* gone and picked her up.  She is an adult, it literally is not your responsibility to pick up after her fuck ups.  Its a nice thing to do, and I support the idea of being there for your kids no matter their age, but you are not *required* to do it, and your wife thinking you are required to do it is straight up bullshit.\n\nLiterally *everyone in this situation* is in the wrong *besides you*.\n\nYou are a parent enjoying your time off, not a fucking on-call surgeon...", "NTA that was a good opportunity to she her about consequences.", "NTA - bad coincidence thats all, you are good stepdad, you picked her up when you could. But in your explanation u should put an emphasis on - you were unfit to drive not at \"teach the lesson part\". You are step dad, her mum can teach her lessons, you simply needed to sober up a bit.", "NTA.\n1. She\u2019s an adult and needs to learn that her mum can\u2019t bail her out of trouble every time.\n2. You\u2019re allowed to have a life. Is your wife going to NEVER drink just in case there\u2019s an emergency? BS.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Her prize was jail for the night. She is an adult and needs to learn.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that they both came to you saying they are disappointed. I would be very disappointed in both of them, especially your step daughter. I can understand you wife is in fight or flight mode but your step daughter has to understand bad decisions lead to bad circumstances.", "NTA. You would have been CRAZY to go to the police station high and 1/2 drunk. Mary is an adult that needs to learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA. You made an upstanding decision for the safety of you, your stepdaughter and other drivers on the road. Your stepdaughter lied, got caught and got punished. This will be a good life lesson for her, especially since you made the decision not to drive specifically because you\u2019d been drinking.", "NTA - your wife wants you to drive drunk to the police station?  So then your wife could bail you both out the next day? 2 for the price of one? \n\nAs for your stepdaughter, she is an adult facing adult consequences.", "Nta. My dad always told me if I\u2019m smart enough to get myself into jail, I\u2019m smart enough to get myself out.", "NTA, and I'll bet Mary doesn't pull that shit again.", "NTA and frankly it's really concerning that the heat is on you instead of your stepdaughter. Sounds like the 18 yr old is a bit of a narcissist and wants to play victim and shift blame elsewhere, and your wife is being an enabler. How was the 18 yr old planning to get home? She was probably better off that she spent the night in jail instead of riding home with a drunk driver or staying at this party house.", "Nta\n\nYou are 100% right, time she learnt that actions have consequences", "NTA. I had a friend get a DUI driving to pick up another friend from jail. Not worth the risk. 18 is old enough to suffer the consequences of their stupidity.", "NTA Her choices, her fault. You were not safe to drive. And where is your wife's disappointment for Mary?", "NTA you are absolutly right. She is an adult and if she can do the crime...she can do the time. You were also right about not driving when you have been drinking.", "NTA, would a DUI or even worse made the situation worse or better?  You had no reason to expect an emergency and caught a good buzz. There's nothing wrong with that, you were in your own home safe and snug.  Mary got in a little trouble, no big deal.  She's not the first kid to have to sleep in a drunk tank and she won't be the last.  Just hopefully it's the first and last for HER.", "NTA.\n\nSo your wife wants you to go to jail for a DUI (yes you go to jail for that), just so you can spend the night in jail with your stepdaughter\u2026\n\nWhat kind of fucked is logic is that?", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing not getting behind the wheel while intoxicated. Your stepdaughter broke the law and faced the consequences. Your wife is an AH for giving you a hard time for not drinking and driving.", "Absolutely NTA! Like you said, everyone was supposed to be hours away, you took that rare night off to enjoy yourself. She shouldn't have gone to a party to drink underage. \nNot to mention she could have called her dad since she figured you weren't coming.", "NTA you did the right thing. I would have done the same. If she's not happy she can now move out, get a job and rent.\n\nHey she's 18 and living at home time to pay some rent unless she is still in full time education.\n\nBig question is what was the spirit? If it's bad you are an asshole.", "NTA - Actions come with consequences and your step-daughter learned that the hard way. I agree with you that it seems like a good lesson tbh. But also.... you had been drinking so exactly what were you supposed to do? I'm not sure what time you woke up but maybe your wife expected it to be earlier.  Either way I don't think your the Ah here.", "NTA rite of passage in the USA\n\nWhere was her bio dad in all of this?", "NTA\nWhat you should risk getting a DUI to save an adult who lied about what she was doing? You had 0 responsibility that night and where safe at home enjoying your night, in no way did you think she wasn't at her dad's safe there.\n\nYour step daughter lied and got in trouble, she made her choice and deserves her punishment. \n\nHow was that steak?", "NTA", "NTA  Problem for Mary is that if she had gone to her dads, rather than lie and go to a party that got busted for whatever reason, she wouldn't have been sitting in a jail cell.  Hopefully she does learn something from this other than manipulating mom into being mad at you.", "NTA her dad could have picked her up also\u2026.", "NTA   a few hours in jail traumatic?  Maybe, I wouldnt know. But it might prevent a life of crime. Lol", "If it was such an emergency, why couldn\u2019t your wife leave the kids with her sister, drive back and pick her up?", "NTA. Daughter got busted, wife wants dad - who had been drinking to go to police station to get daughter. Does anyone else see a problem with this? What are daughter and wife thinking - maybe a bonding experience in jail for dad and daughter!? \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. she should have to learn her lesson. So you were supposed to save her from a traumatic event she caused while under the influence (safely) and drive to get your self arrested?  Not sound logic. Yes you are a parent and should be prepared for emergencies. But the littles were with their mom and the idiot was supposed to be with her father.  Parents are allowed time off occasionally.", "You are absolutely right.  Not only should she face the consequences of her actions, but you would have been committing a crime by picking her up.

Asked your wife why she is enabling her daughter's  immature and bad behavior! Then asked your why isn't she disappointed at her daughter for lying,  sneaking out, and running from authorities? Also asked your wife why she wanted you to be irresponsible and drive while high and drunk and than show up at police station and get arrested for it? \n Than asked both your wife and step daughter how they would feel if you had got seriously injured or had died from driving while impaired or God forbbin seriously hurt or killed someone else from driving while impaired? \n Than telled them you are disappointed in both of them for using you as an escape goat because Mary's doesn't want to own up for her mistakes!\nThan tell them that only way they make amends is to give me a sincere apology and have Mary face the full consequences of her poor decision making!\n\n\n\n would feel if you had died or got se", "NTA.

Mary is using this as an excuse to get out of getting into more trouble. She's making you the bad guy so she can deflect consequences. Traumatized? She was there for a few hours.

We have 2 kids (8 & 5).  My wife also has a daughter, Mary (18) from before we got together.  Mary is in her senior year of high school and lives with us.  She will go see her bio-dad 2 weekends a month, but due to her extra-curricular activities, it is not always an every-other-weekend thing.  Since bio-dad lives about 2 hours away, Mary works out times with her dad for her to visit him and she drives herself there.  \n\nThis past weekend, my wife took our 2 younger kids to visit her sister who lives about 3 hours away.  Before my wife left, Mary told us that she was going to visit her dad that weekend.  I was going to stay home to get some work done on some home projects that had been neglected over the holidays. \n\nSo, on Friday after everyone else had left, I kicked back and took advantage of the very rare opportunity of having an empty house to myself.  I bought a nice bottle of bourbon, visited our local dispensary, and bought myself a nice big steak. \n\nAbout 3am, I was awoken by a phone call.  Any parent knows that a phone call at that time of night is a nightmare situation, so I immediately answered.  It was my wife and she told me that Mary had been arrested and had just called her from our local jail.  Apparently, she had lied about going to her dad's house and had instead attended a party.  The party got busted and Mary panicked and tried to run.  Of course, the cops caught her and arrested her.  My wife said that the police would allow me to go get Mary right away instead of keeping her in jail.\n\nI told my wife that I had been drinking earlier and was probably not safe to drive, let alone drive to a police station.  I told her that I would pick Mary up first thing in the morning.  My wife yelled at me for being irresponsible by drinking to that point in case of an emergency.  I told her that I was home by myself and everyone else in the family was supposed to be hours away, so I essentially had zero responsibility for anyone besides myself.  She eventually calmed down enough to see my side.\n\nThe next morning, I went and got Mary right when I woke up.  When I saw her, it was obvious she had been crying a lot and she didn't say a word to me on the way home.  She immediately went to her room when we got home and didn't come out the entire day.  \n\nThe next day when my wife got home, Mary was still in her room.  My wife talked to her and then came to talk to me.  She told me that both her and Mary are disappointed in me that I made her spend a night in jail instead of getting her right away.  She said that Mary is traumatized by the whole thing.  I told her \"Good, maybe next time she won't lie and do stupid sh!t.\"\n\nI reminded her that Mary is an adult now and she has to get used to facing consequences of her actions and this should be a very clear reminder of what those consequences could be. My wife said that that lesson could have been made without making her spend a night in jail.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If Mary hadn't lied about being with another trusted adult, you wouldn't have had drinks and edibles. You *only* had them because everyone was in a safe space, and you planned to not go anywhere. This whole situation occurred because Mary lied. She's lucky the only thing that happened was that a party got busted.", "NTA. You were high and drunk and it was the middle of the night. It wouldn\u2019t have been safe to drive anywhere, let alone to go talk to some cops. What if they smelled the drink on you and put you in there with her for driving there? Not worth the risk.", "NTA\n\nThere's no reason you had to be sober. Frankly, your SD is lucky she was in the police jail as to an accident.", "NTA.

Seriously though - hopefully spending a night in jail gave her time to think about how her lying screwed her over. She\u2019s 18. Old enough to make decisions, old enough to suffer the consequences!", "NTA because driving while drunk/ high is illegal and immoral.  \n\nIf Uber, Lyft or taxi of any kind had been available, I would say you should go get her, but I read that it was a small town with no ride options, so solid NTA.", "NTA one of my uncles had the spend the night in jail once. For something totally different.", "I dunno, I mean.... my Dad would have come and got me.  But I did need to learn that harsh lesson myself.  And I didn't learn it until I spent a weekend in jail - and I was 32, not 18.  Some people need to have it bashed over their heads like that.  In all likelihood she was put in the drunk tank on a 12 hour hold, not in some maximum security prison. A harsh lesson, but she wasn't in danger. Yeah, it sucks but.... those are the consequences of her actions.  And honestly, it's probably better she learns it at 18 and it sticks. \n\nSo I'm gonna go with a hesitant NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA you\u2019re 100% right", "NTA\n\nBetween her response to her daughter\u2019s actions and her thinking that you should drive after drinking (which could\u2019ve killed you or others), your wife doesn\u2019t have her head on straight. Which is concerning given that she\u2019s raising little humans. If wife cared that much, she should\u2019ve packed up the kids and gone home or arranged for someone else (like bio dad) to help. Sure the former is inconvenient, but many of us have driven long distances on short notice for unexpected urgent matters.\n\nHopefully this is just a one-time case of asshattery.", "NTA.

That\u2019s what the liar gets.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, you could have taken an Uber to get her, but realistically showing ip buzzed to a police station isnt a good look even if you didn\u2019t drive.

But why is everyone overlooking the fact that she LIED about her whereabouts?! It could have ended much worse\u2026 My parents told me from a young age never to lie about my whereabouts. In case if I go missing, they would start looking for me where I told them I was supposed to be.

I personally would have taken an Uber assuming being high is legal where you are.  No way would I in your shoes have driven myself or gone to the police station if it is not legal.

Your children and step-child were out of the house and in the care of somebody else for the night (or so you were led to believe).

You couldn't have overdone it that much if you were able to go get her first thing the next morning.\n\nIf she doesn't want to spend the night in jail, she shouldn't break the law.  Also, where was her dad when this happened?  Did nobody call him to come pick her up?

You reap what you sow.", "LMAO as someone who spent more time in facilities during my later teens and 20s NTA. Why is she crying? Were they not sweet and accommodating?

Maybe she'll think twice next time.", "NTA!!! its the literal meaning of f*ck aorund and find out", "NTA- as you said, you were led to believe that everyone you had responsibility for were hours away.

Bottom line, she messed up, you did not.", "NTA. What were you supposed to do? Drive under the influence to a *police station*? Staying overnight is a small price to pay to learn a lesson. As you said, you didn't expect anything to go wrong had she not *lied* to you. Absolutely NTA", "NTA.. Why didn't your wife start driving to pick her daughter up from police station as soon as she knew you weren't available (in your case unable to drive). She was just 3 hours away. That's what I would have done if I was in her position instead of asking my husband to drive under influence.", "NTA. Your wife and the two children you share were 3 hours away. You thought your step daughter was 2 hours away with her dad. By your wife's logic, you can never enjoy things like marijuana and alcohol in case there's an emergency - which is unrealistic. You had no reason to expect something like that to happen, and you chose the most responsible action which was to not drive under the influence, after consuming/using drugs in a responsible manner, legally, in the privacy of your own home, while you thought everyone was hours away. Sucks that Mary had to spend the night in jail, but at that point, she was (a legal adult) under the supervision of LE and you had no reason to believe she was in immediate danger while there. This was the best choice to make in that situation and not your fault. Also, an 18 year old having to spend the night in jail after getting caught doing something they shouldn't have on top of lying about where they were (not even that they were spending the night at a friends in the same town, but that they were HOURS away with another adult guardian, mind you), is not necessarily an emergency. Sure it was probably an upsetting and scary experience, but she was safe, and you picking her up wouldn't have been any safe for her or you and/or any safer for her.", "NTA. And in fact, there\u2019s a secondary lesson to be learned here in which you didn\u2019t drink and drive showing everyone else in the family how it should be done.", "NTA. \n\nYou couldn't safely drive to bail Mary out without risking committing a serious crime yourself. Hopefully Mary has learned her lesson and will think twice before lying to her mother & going to events that come with a big risk of ending up in the cells.", "NTA 3am? She spent a few hours in jail, not the night. Stupid games, stupid prizes. I wouldn't need to be drunk to let an 18 yr old sit in jail for a night to learn whether or not they want to continue to pursue the type of lifestyle that got them there, but I especially would not drive to a police station drunk. Nor will I avoid having a chill evening to myself when I had no clue I would need to jump in and save the day. \n\nIf she didn't lie and had warned you she was going to a party, maybe it'd be a little different. If my young adult kids told me they were going to a party, I'd likely refrain from going too far a field or getting too buzzed to drive, just in case they needed me.", "NTA.

No. Your wife is being stupid and it seems like she's trying to guilt you and downplay the situation by telling you \"me and Mary are disappointed\". I'm sure your wife would have been more disappointed if you'd have gone to get her and then been arrested for drink driving. Tell your wife you're disappointed she doesn't have any common sense.

I was around her age when I had to spend a single night in jail, and yeah, it fucking sucked.

You didn't tell her to lie and go to a party. It's better that she spent time in jail, lesson learned. If you bailed her and this happened again the consequences could've been worse the second time. You're not wrong in this but rather Mary must own up the mistake she made and the mother shouldn't oppress you for what you did or what you didn't.

If she comes at you with you shouldn't have been drinking just stick to your guns of what you already told her because that's 100% correct.  Everyone was supposed to be far away and you had no responsibility to be put on standby for an emergency of which this was not.

My dad hung up midway through her explanation and looked at her as if she was crazy and said that he didn't call him before he went and did something illegal, why the hell is he calling for him now?

That\u2019s really not that bad honestly compared to what else a kid that age could be getting in trouble for. You could consider it a life lesson alone just for her getting busted and being in that situation, I\u2019m sure she was probably pretty scared and freaked out, forcing her to stay the whole night doesn\u2019t really help in my opinion. What could have helped her was her step father coming to get her and showing her you cared enough to do it.

Someone should spell this out to Mary.", "And *she's* not paying for the lawyer, because...?\n\nIf she doesn't have a job, she needs one. If she goes on probation, they will make her get one.\n\nEither way, you guys don't deserve to have her dip into your coffers to cover for her mistake.", "You know what OP I think you'll be wasting your money on a lawyer.", "I knew it was Wyoming lol! They wait just over the border and rake in the cash.", "Reminds me of that old Was Not Was song, \"Hello From Jail\".\n\nNTA.", "And don't forget asking for snacks because he would of had the munchies from whatever he got from the dispensary", "\u2014 *sunt dracones*", "I understand why she's charged with those things, but the drinking one always gets me.\n\nAnd I agree someone should've spelled out that to Mary. Probably OP.", "She has a part-time job.  But lawyers are expensive.  I have no problem helping her with legal fees in this case.", "The thing was I wasn't even all that close to the border, but I was driving a car with California plates. I'm 95% sure I was profiled by that alone, because the trooper 'clocked' me as speeding as he was driving towards me on the opposite side of the road, and I watched him pull a U-turn and flip on his lights. I was in the middle of nowhere headed to Yellowstone. We had to drive almost an hour to get to the jail in Cody. It was a shitty situation, and one I don't intend to find myself in again.", "I kinda wonder who called the cops. \n\nI think that Mary's parents should have this talk though, with stepdad present. If Mom can get over the \"poor baby had to spend the night in jail!\" schtick. I agree with others that Mary probably panicked because she was caught lying about the party once the cops showed up, and that lying needs to be addressed too.", "Then you are robbing her of one of the most important lessons to be gleaned from this experience.", "Maybe.  Or maybe we would be reminding her that even though she made a mistake, we will still stand next to her and support her.  Doesn't mean that we won't be having very real conversations about how that might change if something like this were to happen again.", "While I don't agree with this particular response I 100% see where you are coming from. I think that you have done everything right. In my humble opinion I think that atleast some of the money from her paycheck should be used to show the lasting and drawn out consequences but that's just me. Btw NTA at all.", "I got caught speeding within 6 months of getting my license, and had to go to court. My mother got me a lawyer and it cost me $75, which was a week's salary for me. I was a lot more careful after that. Though it took me a while to realize that was not the whole lawyer's fee..."]}
