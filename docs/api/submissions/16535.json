Since I started there was this girl that just hated my guts. She's two years older than me and would keep telling at me for the tiniest mistake. Even if it wasn't a mistake and I was just doing something she didn't like. She yelled at me when I asked her if she could help me carry something heavy (because I had a broken foot at the time) for being lazy for example.\n\nThe rest of the time she'd vehemently ignore me. Greeting the people I was chatting with but not me when entering a room, never talking to me unless to yell and insult, never including me in any group activities, etc\n\nThis winter a few people in my club including her and me were working on refurbishing some wooden outdoor planters. It took months. The only fun part would have been to replant the finished planters and we were all waiting until the last one got finished. Except for her. She set herself over everyone and replanted the finished planter by herself taking away the labor of everyone else's hard work.\n\nI was pissed and asked a friend who is current head of the club it he'd be very mad if I started a fight with her. He asked if I could wait two weeks until some big events our club is involved are over. \n\nSo out of respect for him I just wrote into the gardening group \"I'm done. I'm out\" and left the group chat. Thinking that she'd probably feel a bit offended and bitch a little when she sees me the next time but I explicitly didn't accuse her or criticised her behaviour as to not start a fight.\n\nShe couldn't just let me leave the group and decided to DM me and aggressively demand an explanation.\n\nI explained to I did not like how she took away everyone else's sadisfaction by doing her own thing without consulting the group and that's why I didn't want to be part of the gardening group anymore.\n\nShe went livid and started insulting me. I tried to set the boundary I have been wanting to set for years saying \"You have treated me badly from the start and I am done taking it.

If no-one calls her out she'll never learn that she can't just run around verbally abusing people left and right.", "Yeah I get what you mean. I am at the absolute end of my endurance regarding her behaviour and do have an anxiety disorder. Also she screamed at my friend for no reason last weekend and I can't handle my friends being mistreated.\n\nIf I weren't so completely at my end I'd have just ignored her behaviour like I had done the last few years but I just couldn't take it anymore...", "Yeah I really should have... But she's a very persistent person and most likely would have become even more angry if I hadn't answered her", "What about saying \"I'm done. I'm out\" is asshole behaviour? \n\nI promise I'm not trying to argue I just don't understand. I kept it as short as possible as to not include something provoking...", "Honestly the first two paragraphs should be your response to anyone else who asks.  It shows compassion that you understand where she comes from, but shows how she is not coping.  I would leave it.", "NTA. You\u2019re never the AH for putting your mental health before someone else.\n\nI have to ask tho did she yell at you/insult you in front of people? And if so did no one stand up for you? I know for a fact if someone was disrespecting my friend I\u2019d absolutely say something.", "Sometimes. Mostly she'd drag me away. It's a very common occurrence but people just let it happen because they're afraid of directing her wrath at themselves. She's a fully established tyrann.\n\nEdit: spelling and I'm pretty sure the next time I enter the club most people will blame me for the fight became her tyranny is so well established and it's an unspoken rule that you just don't say anything. Wich I cannot accept do I'll do my best to protect my friend until she either sees the error of her ways or I'm getting kicked out. The latter has a higher chance to happen tho.", ">most likely would have become even more angry if I hadn't answered her\n\n........so?\n\nyou're no longer in the group. you're no longer going to interact with her. you're no longer forced to be around her.\n\nher anger no longer affects you unless you allow it to.", "I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you. Something similar happened to me in high school. I ended up moving on from the friend group and a wave of ease washed over me. Hopefully your friends will learn to stand up for themselves but honestly it sounds like you\u2019d benefit from dropping this group and finding more supportive friends. \n\nYou deserve better", "I only left the gardening group. Am still part of the club. Unfortunately that's the only social circle I have. I'd be completely isolated if I left the whole thing", "Tank you. Rationally I know you are right but it's a lot easier to make new friends in high school than in your mind twenties... Honestly I don't even know *how* to find new friends at my age.", "ah, my misunderstanding on that point. but still the first sentence still applies, and it's a useful question to ask when worrying about something: so what?\n\nso what if this girl gets angry? what is she going to do about it? unless the answer to that is \"physically attack you\" then you can and ought to just ignore her (and send her unhinged texts as proof of harassment to the club head because it's his job to deal with her).", "Nah she'll just to the usual verbal harrasment and will continue to do her best of badmouthing me behind my back.\n\nIt's just a big power imbalance because she has much stronger ties to a lot of people in the clubscene. Not everyone will listen to her but some will and then I'm back at the point where people meet me for the first time and already don't like me because of what she has told them...\n\nAbout showing the texts, that isn't possible right now because she conveniently deleted the whole chat history when she decided that the argument is over.", "NTA.  When the others start saying, \"Well that's just how she is\", you need to reply, \"Well this is just how I am\".  Just because they don't want to 'rock the boat' doesn't mean her behaviour should be acceptable.  Repeat that, too -  her behaviour is unacceptable. or inappropriate. or bullying. Or whatever word you want to use. \n\nSay it with a kind smile. No one can argue with you on that point."]}
