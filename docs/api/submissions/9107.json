She literally told you she didn\u2019t like him being there and wanted him to go elsewhere. Why, if you have the other family you mentioned, has he not left?! YTA and honestly, so is your bro for taking advantage of his SIL\u2019s hospitality to this point.", "That sounds like a you problem. TAKE THE HINT", "Then he shouldn\u2019t be there. She\u2019s living in her own home like he isn\u2019t there.", "But do you really?\n\nKick your brother out.   For good.   He has to fix his life, stop being his crutch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n....or find a good divorce lawyer, because you're going to need it.", "Try harder. And while you\u2019re at it, you & your brother should be trying harder to find him a different place to stay. YTA", "What is she doing that's shameful? You *literally* told her to live as she always does, which you have agreed she is doing.", "But here you are talking about her on the internet.", "Ha. That\u2019s fair.", "Yes, it\u2019s typical.", "Yes, usually.", "Naked isn\u2019t out of the question at this point.", "She\u2019s been topless, I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s going.", "Fair.", "Yeah, seems so.", "He\u2019s seen her topless.", "Fair.", "Wrong post!", "You didn't think it through and still expected her'", "Yes, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m uptight about this.", "I do yep.", "Being almost naked, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s shameful.", "So, when you said she could act like she normally does, you didn't *really* mean it.", "So why are you surprised? She is living like he isn\u2019t there as you agreed. Or did you actually expect her to modify her life for his comfort and you agreed to that to placate her ?", "So you knew you were bullshitting when you said she could act like he wasn\u2019t there lol", "Lol. \n\n> she did exactly what she said she would do, and I didn\u2019t expect that. \n\nAbout right?", "So you told her to live how she normally does but secretly expected her to change her behavior for your brother? That's not fair.", "Her leaving you is not either. Is that what you want to see happen? Because I can tell you she's getting there.", "So? \n\nI can't see how you're not the ahole in the situation.\n\nI fully support your wife walking around the house naked, if it gets you to finally listen to her and your brother to move out. And she hasnt even done that yet. (According to you) \n\nI honestly dont know how she hasnt divorced you yet. She must have the patience of a saint!", "Kinda seems that you don\u2019t care about your wife\u2019s feelings. Your brothers comfort is more important than hers. \n\nLook. I\u2019m a sister of an addict. I get it. But the recovery acrobatic routine gets super old. And it ruins relationships. I tolerate my sibling but if we weren\u2019t related I would never talk to them. It\u2019s been over 30 years of this bs. Focus on your marriage or frankly, just leave it.", "I mean, you're \"uptight\" about this because he's your brother and you care about him. It makes sense. At the same time, marrying someone means you have to care about their feelings and prioritize them, and your home is both of y'all's home. You can't expect to make unilateral decisions about who stays over, etc. I think it's time to consider other ways you can support your brother that don't involve him living with you.", "It honestly sounds like your brother has been through a lot, and you are probably *too* forgiving of him, his life choices, and because of that, he knows he has you to fall back on.   Possible trauma in his past?  Your past together?  \n\nWhatever the case, try to recognize that people don't rise to expectations if there are none.  \n\nYour brother is an adult, and you probably don't think you should be \"raising him,\" so to speak, but that needs to happen here.   You need to have expectations of him, and he needs to fall back on someone else, or quit falling back at *some point*.\n\nDismissing your wife when she said she doesn't want him there, getting her to agree on the grounds of her having a condition put in place and then reniging on that very condition?   YTA. \n\nIt's her house as much as it is yours, and you've made it more your brothers flop house than your wife's home.", "Goodness you apparently have also suggested opening the marriage to your wife because you have a dead bedroom? Maybe if you stopped inviting unwanted people into her home you wouldn\u2019t have such problems. YTA. I hope she leaves you.", "I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d go this far.", "Yep.", "Thanks for that.", "Thanks, you\u2019re nice", "So you did want her to tone it down and be appropriate as she would be when guests are around, right? Do you not see this flaw in your logic? You tell her to live as if he's not there and then when she does it's \"oh no not like that\" so what do you actually want?", "So what\u2019s the question? Are you the asshole for complaining that your wife did exactly what she said she\u2019d do? Are you the asshole for pushing your wife to this point? \n\nYou know the answer.", "Hopefully, you have learned to listen your wife! You don't need to modify your behavior when your brother moves in with you, but she does. Time for your brother to find a living arrangement that doesn't involve you house, or you may just need to find another place to live yourself!", "Do you not trust your brother? What\u2019s the real problem", "It\u2019s just a lot that he\u2019s seen her, well, naked.", "Then don\u2019t have him live in her home.", "So kick him out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou keep agreeing with everyone about this, but are you kicking him out of your house?  \n\n\nIf not, then you're not getting it.", "Are you this much of a selfish, passive weathervane in the rest of your life? Even your answers are so disengaged and passive; like you're not actually considering what people are saying, you're just conditioned to give a mealymouthed response. Who parented you this badly?!", "Thinking it through.", "Fair!"]}
