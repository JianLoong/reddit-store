I found a cheaper place in Brooklyn for $900. (Not that big of a difference but I need something cheaper). Now here's the problem: \n\nI could move back in with my religious Muslim family (I'm Pakistani American, gay af btw), but my mom still wants me to pay to live there. She said $1,000 but I know as the eldest I would not only be working full time, I would take care of the house and family (Cooking, cleaning, caring for others etc.) I know I'll have a curfew of 10pm, and be forced to stay in the closet to avoid being yelled at. The answer may seem obvious, but this is what I grew up with and I'm trying to get out of there but I can't do much financially.\n\nMy mom knows I want to marry a woman, but says it pains her just like my abusive absent father, who I get compared to a lot, and says she can't look at me. She clearly can and has. Because of my dad's dumbassery however, my mom is struggling to pay bills and take care of everyone. She has to get injections in her eye because she popped a blood vessel in her eye due to stress. Now, watching your own mother's health deteriorate, and deciding if you should help is not an easy call to make. However, I would love to help her if she would treat me like a person.

I love my mom and I'm sure you do too, but you will have a huge burden to bear if you live with her. And if you fear that you wouldn't be able to handle it, then I don't think you should put yourself through it in the first place", "NTA\n\nShe can't look at you but wants you to move in and pay $1K a month?\n\nSet yourself up as an independent and thriving person and be there for your siblings as they get older if you can.

If there are others in the house who are capable, they should step up and help her.", "NTA.

I'm sorry your mom is having difficulties, but none of that is your fault or responsibility. There's a saying that goes \"don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm\". This definitely applies here. You will only be harming yourself if you move in with your mom to \"help\".", "NTA. Your mum needs to move out of the city to somewhere cheaper, if she can't afford it.

I understand you want to help, and watching her health deteriorate is hard, but your health matters too and it would take a nosedive living in those conditions. You deserve to live in a place where you can be safe, and happy, and ***YOU***. Sadly, that isn't your mother's home. Move to the $900 place, and help your mother as you can without living with her", "no you are of course not because its normal that you dont wanna live with your parents anymore you are 23 years old. I th\u0131ink that your mom is scared that something may happen to you and doesnt wanna belive that now you are an adult and not a child. So she is trying to change your mind by making you feel like the asshole here and feel sorry for your mom but I think that is just abuse not physically but meantly and you should do whatever you want not because of what ur mom says because you want to.", "NTA and you need to decide who's life you value more: yours or your mom's?

It sounds like your family home has a lot of toxicity going around and it\u2019s best for you to stay out of it for your own sake. I get the cultural aspect because I\u2019m Hispanic and for us, family is everything. But when your own mother yells at you and openly says she can\u2019t look at you because you\u2019re gay, that is not the kind of environment you want to live in.", "NTA. I spent a long time believing my mother's health issues were caused/exacerbated by my behavior. Don't fall in that trap. Eye vessels don't just rupture because your child making you stressed.... $10 says she has an underlying chronic issue like hypertension or diabetes.", "NTA- You need your own space and to be able to live your life as who you are. The best thing to give to your family is to help them get back on their own feet, not yours.... if/however you can do that. You don't have to but if you feel like you do want to help your family there are other ways than moving in and taking over the housework/emotional labor. Not all the time, but whenever there's a day you have a couple of hours, you could make dinner or help with a couple of chores. If you have a little bit of money that can make a difference you could bring over a couple of groceries (milk or bread or a box of rice). If you don't, you can see if your mom is eligible for some help at a food pantry or help her find a way to get extra income (if they have an extra room for you maybe they can rent it out). There are little things you can do to assist or help her get back on her feet without giving up your life.", "NTA. Paying $1000 a month for the privilege of being treated like an indentured servant? I would not. She is asking for way too much with literally no benefit to you. Do not sacrifice your mental and financial wellbeing in exchange for your mother's.

And considering she verbally and at times physically abusive I would say yeah, that checks out.", "Yes but I've been told if I marry a woman, my mom wants nothing to do with me. She probably won't let my younger siblings see me either.", "Disagree. Helping a parent is a kindness - they *chose* to have you and so they *owed* you a good upbringing. It's the bare minimum for bringing you into the world. Obviously, most people want to help their parents, if they were decent, I've helped my Mum out - but I didn't *owe* her help and it was in no way obligatory. Being raised by your parents isn't something that holds any debt or reciprocation.", "The last sentence says it all - you'd love to help her if she treated you like a person.\n\nA threshold condition should be that you are treated as fully human and your life and loves are just as valid as anyone else's - because, of course, they are.\n\nYou're a good person - you can see your mother struggling and, despite the fact that she does not meet the threshold condition, you feel for her.\n\nThe trouble is, she is not able to feel for you. That's a very big difference. \n\nYou might consider saying that to her, if you have not already - that if she fully accepts you, then you will help her. My guess is you already know the answer, possibly because you've basically had that conversation already.\n\nI don't think you should put your life on hold. I do think you should let any others in the household (e.g. siblings) that you have offered to help, but she turned you down. She will badmouth you - probably already has.", "Just make sure your siblings have your phone number before that happens.", "OP, I am truly sorry. This is \ud83d\udcaf your decision. \nWould your sisters talk to you once they leave the household? \nI mean either way you have to 1) Give up your family 2) Give up your very identity \nThis is a lousy choice, Honey. I can\u2019t fathom this.", "What do your younger siblings have to say about it? Surely there are apps you can use to communicate that she doesn't know about.", "I didn't say obligatory, I very consciously said it *approaches* it. Assuming a decent childhood.", "Except that it doesn't. It's nowhere even close to obligatory, that was my point."]}
