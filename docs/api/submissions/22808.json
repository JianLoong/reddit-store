Now here's the problem: \n\nI could move back in with my religious Muslim family (I'm Pakistani American, gay af btw), but my mom still wants me to pay to live there. She said $1,000 but I know as the eldest I would not only be working full time, I would take care of the house and family (Cooking, cleaning, caring for others etc.) I know I'll have a curfew of 10pm, and be forced to stay in the closet to avoid being yelled at. The answer may seem obvious, but this is what I grew up with and I'm trying to get out of there but I can't do much financially.\n\nMy mom knows I want to marry a woman, but says it pains her just like my abusive absent father, who I get compared to a lot, and says she can't look at me. She clearly can and has. Because of my dad's dumbassery however, my mom is struggling to pay bills and take care of everyone. She has to get injections in her eye because she popped a blood vessel in her eye due to stress.

The best thing to give to your family is to help them get back on their own feet, not yours.... if/however you can do that. You don't have to but if you feel like you do want to help your family there are other ways than moving in and taking over the housework/emotional labor. Not all the time, but whenever there's a day you have a couple of hours, you could make dinner or help with a couple of chores. If you have a little bit of money that can make a difference you could bring over a couple of groceries (milk or bread or a box of rice). If you don't, you can see if your mom is eligible for some help at a food pantry or help her find a way to get extra income (if they have an extra room for you maybe they can rent it out).

That's a very big difference. \n\nYou might consider saying that to her, if you have not already - that if she fully accepts you, then you will help her. My guess is you already know the answer, possibly because you've basically had that conversation already.\n\nI don't think you should put your life on hold.
