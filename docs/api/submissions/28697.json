Some people need to hear it and be disgusted in order for them to leave others alone and shut their mouths.\n\nWhat is his problem anyway?

Mostly.\n\nYes, the guy very much had it coming.  Who cares what you have or don\u2019t have in your coffee?  And your response was hilarious!\n\nNow, for any other customers, not so much.  For the barista, I suspect she was cheering.  After she picked her jaw up off the floor\u2026unless she was squeamish.", "NTA. His faulty assumptions about how everyone should have the same diet as him were just demonstrated to be wrong, in spectacular fashion. Will he engage in any self-reflection on this incident and try to personally grow? Probably not.

Maybe his family dairy went out of business and got turned into an almond farm?

Weak society won\u2019t suckle any longer from the teet of a cow and he is furious about it. How dare we withdrawal from the safe confines of the teet! Doesn\u2019t he know we are weak soy boys for it! We aren\u2019t men or strong anymore because NO SUCKEL TEET!!!! \n\nNTA - actually, hilarious and factually what you should\u2019ve done.

It\u2019s so good and easy on my stomach (even though I have no intolerances/allergies). But frozen coffees mainly contain whole milk and I\u2019m alright with that. \n\nAnyway, dude should have kept his damn mouth shut. It literally costs nothing to mind your business and not be a dick about something that literally has nothing to do with you. I would have laughed my ass off and given you the latte for free.

Why is it so hard for people to just STFU and let people live how they want too?", "NTA People who take offense to plant milk are ridiculous. Of course it\u2019s not real milk! You can\u2019t milk an almond or an oat, it\u2019s marketing.

I'm lactose intolerant too and I would have done the same.", "NTA. He asked...you answered...", "NTA! He totally deserved your comment and clearly wanted a response from you.  He wanted the world to know his opinion and you were justified to tell him why his opinion is meaningless.  Maybe he'll keep his mouth shut next time and enjoy his coffee his way, while everyone else enjoys theirs.", "No, this is awesome.\n\nHe\u2019s a child, he needs to grow up. You had a little fun reflecting back for him just how unreasonable he is.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.", "It was 100% called for lol NTA.

Some strangers push until they have to be taught a lesson. Thanks for being the one to do it.", "NTA.  He asked a question - you answered.
