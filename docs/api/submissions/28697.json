Mostly.\n\nYes, the guy very much had it coming.  Who cares what you have or don\u2019t have in your coffee?  And your response was hilarious!\n\nNow, for any other customers, not so much.  For the barista, I suspect she was cheering.  After she picked her jaw up off the floor\u2026unless she was squeamish.", "NTA. His faulty assumptions about how everyone should have the same diet as him were just demonstrated to be wrong, in spectacular fashion. Will he engage in any self-reflection on this incident and try to personally grow? Probably not.

It\u2019s so good and easy on my stomach (even though I have no intolerances/allergies). But frozen coffees mainly contain whole milk and I\u2019m alright with that. \n\nAnyway, dude should have kept his damn mouth shut. It literally costs nothing to mind your business and not be a dick about something that literally has nothing to do with you. I would have laughed my ass off and given you the latte for free.

I'm lactose intolerant too and I would have done the same.", "NTA. He asked...you answered...", "NTA! He totally deserved your comment and clearly wanted a response from you.  He wanted the world to know his opinion and you were justified to tell him why his opinion is meaningless.  Maybe he'll keep his mouth shut next time and enjoy his coffee his way, while everyone else enjoys theirs.", "No, this is awesome.\n\nHe\u2019s a child, he needs to grow up. You had a little fun reflecting back for him just how unreasonable he is.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.", "It was 100% called for lol NTA.

Some strangers push until they have to be taught a lesson. Thanks for being the one to do it.", "NTA.  He asked a question - you answered.
