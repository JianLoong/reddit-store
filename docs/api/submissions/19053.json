He's just lazy and you shouldn't be enabling that kind of behavior.", "NTA. 22 is old enough to figure it out.", "nta", "You know your a AH...you pride yourself for being one. So I'm unsure why you care if a bunch of strangers think you are", "NTA - You are my hero!", "He used to call me mom, I took care of him while my mom worked and raised him until he was 9. I moved out as soon as I turned 17 and got married at 20. I feel guilty for leaving him in that household but he hasn\u2019t done himself any favors to grow up.", "Also they'll struggle when mum passes", "Lol I actually have both my brothers on DND. For the most part it\u2019s amazing.", "I didn\u2019t know that.

They can also cook, clean, and do both household repair and art. My goal as a single mom was to raise men that women would want to be with.  I think that a lot of people want their kids to stay dependent on them to maintain control and proximity. A fully independent adult is going to contact their family when they WANT to not when they HAVE to.. I think that terrifies some parents.", "You're not an AH, you just seem to be for the most part surrounded by ones", "If you are that affected by them, it is a serious sign of trouble for your health.  You can't control their behavior, so how are you going to change yours to save your sanity? Sounds like you are surrounded by bullies, and the only thing that bullies respond to is forcefully standing up to them.", "Clearly NTA. So generally speaking the military doesn\u2019t require a a passport to travel for deployment.  When they do require it they need an official government passport.  He can review the foreign clearance guide along with the cocom, and location specific country clearance requirements.   This isn\u2019t that big of a deal it\u2019s just new to him.   He\u2019s asking you because he doesn\u2019t want to look like an idiot to his unit.   \n\nThe longer he waits the more difficult it\u2019ll be to get this stuff accomplished. And resulting in needing to go up higher in the chain to ask for a favor.   I honestly wouldn\u2019t engage because you are a marine and he\u2019s in a difficult component.   He\u2019s acting like an individual.  Lol.  I\u2019m surprised his unit isn\u2019t holding his hand through the entire process.", "NTA.Yuour brother needs to start adulting and your parents need to let him.", "NTA - seriously they are gonna let someone who can\u2019t work out how to get their passport sorted without their big sister doing it for them actually carry live ammo? That is not a comforting thought.", "NTA seems like he may have gotten in some sort of trouble? In this case the army and his superiors would be the best people to ask for advice.", "NTA.  But you do not *need* a passport to be deployed in the military.  You travel on military planes.  I went to 3 countries and never had a passport until after I got out of the military.  So I don\u2019t even know what that\u2019s about at all.", "I\u2019m wondering what the hell this is about.  I never did a damn thing for a passport in the army and they shipped my ass right on out of the country, no problems.", "I give you permission to feel ZERO GUILT! You did more than any child should be forced to do. FFS, you were a child yourself. Go live your life and leave them to figure it out. All of them. They're still children from the sounds of it. Growing up is tough. Good for you for moving our right at 17. Set firm boundaries. You are their sister, not their mother or their maid!", "Agreed with everyone else- You\u2019re not an AH, you\u2019re just constantly in defense mode because of those around you", "I cackled when you said Google is free! That\u2019s exactly how I got mine done for a cruise. Even better, barring one question to my mother, I did the entire process myself. It\u2019s so quick and easy. Fill out the form, bring some mail and birth certificate, and some pictures and boom! Done. The hard part is waiting. Some places even have same day service. Heck he could call a passport office and get most everything he needs information wise from them.", "NTA. This made me chuckle thinking about a grown ass Army man telling his superior officer he can\u2019t deploy because his sister has changed and won\u2019t help him fix his eff-up even though his mommy asked her to do so. Dang. Keep on being you sister.", "NTA. I hate how they want us to be independent and subservient at the same time. Your brothers and other family members can rely on themselves and each other. You do not have to be their savior.", "NTA, good on you!", "INFO: What is AFIS?", "NTA - either he will figure it out or when his unit hits Mob Site they will figure it out for him.", "He is going into the military and he's so useless he can't even read the piece of paper he was given to figure out his own issue?\n\nDoting Dingbats do know that the military has no use for people who are useless, don't they?\n\nNTA.  And make sure to have a ready supply of popcorn for when he washes out of basic.", "NTA, I was Canadian Army years ago, a line one of my old instructors used and always rattles around in my noggin is perfect for your little brother.  \n\"you need to get with the program, because the program will not get with you\"  \nTo be fair, my little brother needs this on repeat as he can't do anything that requires any brain cells. Nothing wrong with him, just incapable of helping himself if there is even a hint of someone else doing it for him.", "NTA... you are not your brothers keepers. I do help my younger brother, he has a learning disability but he appreciates my efforts.  He buys me small sweet gifts and says thankyou every time. (Lovely bottle of gin last week) \n\nIn your case you are being used by an ungrateful family. I think it partly a cultural norm to use women as family caregivers. This doesnt stop you from setting your boundaries.  It doesnt make you an AH either.", "NTA", "NTA. I had this argument with my mom a while ago. I can love and support my brothers, or I can be their caregiver. I can't do both. After some spirited debate, we agreed that I will love them and they'll stumble through on their own. Life is better now", "Nta but your whole family sound like using, manipulative assholes", "Right? I helped a friend get a passport after they were discharged from the Army where they had been deployed overseas. OP is right to stay out of this mess. Little brother can call people in the Army for help.", "It sounds like you need a holiday from everyone,.... birth family AND in-laws.\n\nNTA OP.\n\nYou're absolutely right in what you said to your Mother about your brother.", "Tell your brother to contact his member of Congress/senators they can probably help with the passport. My member helped some relatives get theirs", "Oh dear me, do you have to teach him how to hold his weapon, too?\n\nNTA\n\n(I'm envisioning him in combat with you on speed dial)", "NTA. He needs to learn how to stand on his own feet now that he's an adult and being deployed soon. It's not your responsibility to mother him now that he will be away from your family and can't always get to beg for help 24/7", "NTA. This seems to be one more thing in a long list of things you've been frustrated with. It is not your job to take care of every little challenge that falls in the path of every one of your family members.  \n\nI get the sense that if you were treated with care and appreciation you wouldn't be an AH at all.  Instead of being a doormat you're choosing to stand up for yourself and I respect that very much.", "NTA this isn't the normal level of \"family helping eachother out.\" You are correct, if he can't follow orders to get his deployment fulfilled then the real world is going to hit him quick. It will be his own fault.", "NTA - oldest of 4 here, only one in the military: I rearrange to suit them as I feel able/willing to do so. And not when I don\u2019t. They have parents, but the parentification is strong and you aren\u2019t wrong here. \n\nHe needs to talk to his higher-ups, he isn\u2019t the only one in the Army with this issue.", "Love this post!", "NTA.

I\u2019m also the middle of 3, with a similar age gap, middle child syndrome, and my older sister is also in the army. He\u2019s a grown adult and he can do it himself. If he really needs help with it there are plenty of people/services the army offers for issues like this (at least I believe so, even if not he can google it himself). That\u2019s his problem, not yours.", "NTA. You did help by telling him it\u2019s a DOD issue and to talk to the army about it. What else are you supposed to do here?", "NTA and your brother is lying about something. His Military ID card functions well as a passport to most countries. If he needs an actual passport he should be getting a military issued one and that should be coming from either his personnel office or legal at least. I'm betting he failed out of boot camp or got kicked for something or other. Wild conjecture, obviously, but why else wouldn't his COC be working on this with him?", "NTA", "NTA. If your brother can\u2019t figure out how to get a passport, god help when he\u2019s deployed. You\u2019re not an AH at all. Your family is.", "My petty heart wants me to suggest you tell your brother to tell his superiors this.", "You might need to check out the r/JustnoMIL sub (it works for moms too)!"]}
