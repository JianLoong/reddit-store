And this has gotten into her head. \n\nNTA but there is no good, correct answer here. I am sorry.\n\nBut if she wants to go through your phone, make sure you would get to go through hers, too.", "NTA. \nIs she willing to let you do the same with her phone? She might be projecting her infidelity onto you or she has a friend whose in her ear and messing with your relationship, either way you need to nip this or you won\u2019t have a relationship", "NTA but she thinks you\u2019re cheating, that\u2019s what is up.", "NTA\n\nI would be rethinking this relationship.\n\nShe is not going to trust you ever.", "Info: \n\n>She said she thinks I've been actin different and thinks something is up.\n\nHave you? Is something up?", "NTA \n\nIf you are not doing anything wrong, let her look through your phone. Then dump her. Tell her she did not trust you, so you need to move along to someone who does. I know several people will say to not let her look but I would give her the opportunity to see she is wrong, then give her the consequences of her actions (getting dumped). \n\nIf you are cheating, you need to break up with her. Dont keep her in a relationship with someone who is dishonest.", "NTA.  She has no right to look through your phone.  She sounds like she\u2019s on a fishing trip for some reason.  If she won\u2019t tell you why she\u2019s acting like this and discuss it like adults, she doesn\u2019t get to even ask for the privilege of invading your privacy.", "NTA but consider trading phones. See if she will give you the same trust she is seeking from you. You\u2019re not in the wrong for not wanting to but you ARE feeding into the paranoia that you could easily fix. Trade phones.\n\nIf she refuses, she\u2019s looking for something to pin on you so she will feel less guilty for her own cheating.", "nta - your entitled to your privacy on your phone everyone does.  and ur gf is a hypocrite all of sudden its ok to do it.  and her refusing to tell u why she wants to do it makes her the one acting suspicious.", "NTA. She's not communicating something that would probably be easily cleared up if she would at least discuss it with you. When someone shows you who they really are, believe them.", "Definitely NTA - when you feel the need to go through your partners phone something is really weird though. I assume your not having an affair?!I strongly recommend you to think about this relationship and if you really want to stay.", "NTA You have a right to demand your privacy, but you will also have to suffer the consequence of that action. Either way sucks, because she doesn\u2019t trust you. Going through your phone isn\u2019t really going to change that. It might put it on hold, but whatever insecurity that she has is just going to show back up at a later date. So, pretty much, this relationship is over all but the saying goodbye.", "I think there's some nuance here.\n\nI'll start by saying I don't go through my husband's phone, and he hasn't gone through mine. We operate on \"private but not secret\". We each are entitled to privacy, but if either of us had doubts it would be easy enough to ask to see messages or anything else. (We know passwords and have used the other's phone for various things)\n\nHowever - there's a big difference between going through someone's phone secretly, and asking permission. I agree that neither are necessarily healthy in a relationship - since you should be able to trust your partner without having to look at their phone.\n\nIf she is having doubts, then something is causing that. I think she should be able to say what is causing that, but I don't know how your relationship works and how disagreements have worked out in the past. Something has broken her trust - it could have nothing to do with you.\n\nBut an easy way to build that trust back in her mind is letting her see your phone.\n\nIf there is something you don't want her to see - a surprise you are planning, a venting conversation with a friend, conversations with a friend or family where they've told you something that they asked you not to tell anyone else - let her know and tell her why.\n\nAt this point you either allow her to see you have nothing to hide, or hold your ground and potentially lose this relationship.\n\nNAH. She's got stuff she's working through, and you're upset that she's doubting you and your intentions. You both need to have an honest conversation with each other.", "NTA NTA NTA. I am screaming this for the people at the back, NTA. It\u2019s a dangerous slippery slope and opens the door. It then becomes \u201cwell you let me look before, why not now?\u201d This is incredibly manipulative behaviour on her part and if the trust has gone, it\u2019s gone. It is also ridiculous she won\u2019t have a conversation about her issue all of a sudden. I hate to say it but these posts usually end up with the partner doing something suspect and then projecting on to the OP. \n\nDo not let her manipulate you into letting her look at your phone, it\u2019s completely inappropriate and if I was in a situation where I felt the need to look at my partners phone for no apparent reason, I\u2019d be questioning the relationship and myself rather than putting it on my partner for no valid reason. My ex did this and I thoughtlessly said yes and it was hell on Earth from then on with no privacy, gaslighting etc. never again.", "NTA - she\u2019s refusing to communicate in a healthy way. That doesn\u2019t bode well.", "NTA. Stick to your guns", "NTA\n\nSo she\u2019s insisting you let her go through your phone, but she won\u2019t tell you why? That is hypocrisy at its highest order. Tell her that if she goes through your phone, you get to go through hers", "Tricky. She's hiding something... the reasons for her need to look through your phone. Could be someone she knows is cheating, could  be someone has said they saw something... But it's tough, she has lost trust and something needs to happen to get it back. Or you need to split. I think that for a first offence, as it were, you could let her look, although if the phone has been out of her sight since she asked that will look to her like you have deleted the evidence.\n\nIf you want to stay together you have to be open, talk to her try to find what she is worried about, tell her where you have been, who you've spoken to. And let her look. But if this is a repeating problem and you haven't done anything wrong you may choose not to continue with the relationship rather than live under a constant air of distrust.", "She thinks you are acting differently. Relationship won\u2019t last. What are you hiding? Die on the hill if you want to, she already doesn\u2019t trust you.", "YTA. If you have nothing to hide, it's not a big deal. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (Also, it should be a two way street, so you could look at hers if need be).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't touch my partners phone unless he gives it to me to do something, and I don't like anyone touching my phone AT ALL.", "NTA. She needs to be willing to state her concerns.  Sounds like she thinks its fair if shes mad at you for cheating, but not if you're mad at her for making a false accusation. What's up with that? Can't partners just talk???\nOr...she already went through your phone and found something  but doesn't want to admit it.", "NTA. My life is such that I have been happily married for 23+ years and we both know each other's codes to see phones, email, etc. \n\nI rarely check my husband's phone and I have no idea how often (if ever) he checks mine. The thing is that WE CAN without any static from each other. \n\nSorry, but your GF sounds suspicious. Do you need that kind of headache?", "NTA but someone or something has convinced her that you are cheating on her.", "You're NTA.", "NTA. However I will say that a very common tactic for cheaters to use to throw their partner off balance is to accuse them of cheating.", "NTA. Tell her to piss off. I don\u2019t see no ring on this finger.", "Yeah, a friend could've gotten into her head.

Don\u2019t hurt someone for being paranoid about getting hurt. This isn\u2019t a relationship-killer if they can talk this out, maybe even seek some help from a couples\u2019 therapist. She is seeking to trust him, or she\u2019s seeking to bury him to hide her own unfaithfulness\u2026 but please figure out which it is before punishing her.", "> If you have nothing to hide, it's not a big deal\n\nThis isn't correct since you should still be entitled to privacy if you're in a relationship", "\u201cIf you have nothing to hide it\u2019s not a big deal\u201d is a terrible justification for having your sense of privacy ripped away. Everyone deserves some sense of independence and individuality, and telling your partner they need to give that up without telling them why is controlling, manipulative, and near-abusive. It is a very slippery slope into full on abuse. \n\nSource: have been there, nothing to hide but trust revoked for factors outside my control, and acquiescing didn\u2019t solve the situation - as others have said, it just set the precedent so that if I refused, I was obviously hiding something major. No, I really just don\u2019t want that person seeing the embarrassing litany of tabs I\u2019ve got open for various  wikis and dumb questions because she would make fun of me for them. Awful combination of actions.", "Possibly, or maybe a friend of hers got cheated on or there was a group conversation and it came up. \n\nBut yeah, she should give a justification, otherwise it is very weird. That said, though it\u2019s very obvious what it would be about since she identified that his behavior changed, OP seems to be intentionally avoiding the word \u201ccheating\u201d in the post so it makes me suspicious of them too. Either he\u2019s very dense or he did do something that would justify her paranoia and he\u2019s trying to get a reddit post of people going NTA to avoid handing over his phone and getting caught.", "If there's really been no change in behaviour, then it's likely that one of her friends just found out their boyfriend is cheating, and she's gotten in her head about it. \n\nI wouldn't want anyone having full access to my phone either. There are certain things that they just have no right to see, like messages to my mum (or any family member, who I am clearly not cheating with). But if someone I was in a relationship with just wanted to check that I didn't have any dating apps installed, and wasn't sexting people on reddit, then I'd let them look... even if we established that we didn't like that. Once that trust is starting to crumble, it's hard to solidify it again without some willingness to be open. \n\nI never once looked at my ex's phone/computer (or asked to), as we had established that we both loathed cheating and didn't like snooping. He was having online sexual relationships from 6 months into our 10 year relationship. So I slightly regret being so trusting now. \n\nStories like mine are often the reason why people start questioning their relationships. If she has a friend/acquaintance going through it, it may just be making her panic.", "I agree. But is this a hill you're going to die on?", "Yeah because having privacy is a pretty big deal", "Looks like you were just hoping for people to agree with you, instead of possibly challenge you. So we can just agree to disagree (or just disagree).", "No I just don't agree with your point of view. I just don't get how you can see giving up your privacy as something that is completely acceptable", "Or and here\u2019s a reallllly wild concept, she can use her big girl words and tell him why she wants to go through his phone. She doesn\u2019t have a right to go through it just because \u201csomethings off\u201d. She can either talk it out with him or leave him alone about it."]}
