(We know passwords and have used the other's phone for various things)\n\nHowever - there's a big difference between going through someone's phone secretly, and asking permission. I agree that neither are necessarily healthy in a relationship - since you should be able to trust your partner without having to look at their phone.\n\nIf she is having doubts, then something is causing that. I think she should be able to say what is causing that, but I don't know how your relationship works and how disagreements have worked out in the past. Something has broken her trust - it could have nothing to do with you.\n\nBut an easy way to build that trust back in her mind is letting her see your phone.\n\nIf there is something you don't want her to see - a surprise you are planning, a venting conversation with a friend, conversations with a friend or family where they've told you something that they asked you not to tell anyone else - let her know and tell her why.\n\nAt this point you either allow her to see you have nothing to hide, or hold your ground and potentially lose this relationship.\n\nNAH.

It is also ridiculous she won\u2019t have a conversation about her issue all of a sudden. I hate to say it but these posts usually end up with the partner doing something suspect and then projecting on to the OP. \n\nDo not let her manipulate you into letting her look at your phone, it\u2019s completely inappropriate and if I was in a situation where I felt the need to look at my partners phone for no apparent reason, I\u2019d be questioning the relationship and myself rather than putting it on my partner for no valid reason.

There are certain things that they just have no right to see, like messages to my mum (or any family member, who I am clearly not cheating with). But if someone I was in a relationship with just wanted to check that I didn't have any dating apps installed, and wasn't sexting people on reddit, then I'd let them look... even if we established that we didn't like that. Once that trust is starting to crumble, it's hard to solidify it again without some willingness to be open. \n\nI never once looked at my ex's phone/computer (or asked to), as we had established that we both loathed cheating and didn't like snooping. He was having online sexual relationships from 6 months into our 10 year relationship.
