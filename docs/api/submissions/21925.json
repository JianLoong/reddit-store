Regardless of sex, it's the right thing to help your mother around the house, especially given she is tired and working and you are on vacation. Your brothers are also TA for not helping her, but you can't control their actions, only your own. What other people do or don't do has no effect on the ethics of your own actions. She shouldn't have hit you or called you names, that's terrible, but it sounds like she is at her breaking point and really feels overworked and underappreciated. Your whole family should address this together and all of you living at home should have chores and responsibilities around the house instead of making your mother do everything and acting like spoiled brats.", "Yes.

I always do them with no problem but at this point I was so annoyed that I\u2019m the one who has chores while both my brothers do not.

However, it can be worth trying. Your mom (and dad and brothers) will ask you to do things because it is easier than getting your brothers to do things.   \n\n\nA few suggestions.   \n\n\nGo back to your mom and apologize. Tell her you know she works so hard and does so much for the family and you realise that you should help out. \\[pause and let her agree\\]  \nThen continue that you know she cooks and cleans for a househould of 4 adults and one teenager and she is doing so much work.  \\[pause and let her agree\\]  \n\n\nTell her you will help, but you don't understand why you are expected to help (list the things you helped with in the last week) and you go to school but you don't understand why your brothers (who don't even have school) do less than you? \\[pause and let her stutter something about boys\\]  \n\n\nThen tell her that you will help but only as much as your brothers do. Tell her you will even  ignore the fact that you have school and they don't. You want to help. You will help, but you aren't your brothers' servant.   \n\n\nIt might help a bit. It might not. Chances are your mother will martyr herself rather than ask her sons to do anything.   \n\n\nAnd then grow up and move out.", "OP NTA! \nI get it, it\u2019s so annoying to be expected to do all the work. My parents were also raised in this culture, but since we live in germany we don\u2019t do that here anymore. Everyone helps in the household, regardless if they are men or woman.\nYou\u2018re already being a responsible daughter and your mom is punishing you (hitting you) for what? Pointing out that your brothers do nothing around the house while being adults. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly so embarrassing that she\u2018s enabling their lazy behaviour all the time. I personally would just do the chores but would definitely resent my parents for it. I believe this is a fight you won\u2019t win, because sexism is engraved into their brain.", "Ugh I grew up in a house like this. Not immigrants though just sexist rednecks. One silver lining for you is how much more prepared for adulthood you\u2019ll be. I could run a whole household at 14, but my brothers became adults without knowing how to do laundry, cook or clean. It\u2019s been a hindrance for them. \n\n\nSorry you\u2019re dealing with this , OP. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll leave at 18 and never look back. Best of luck.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.  However, your mom is used to a more traditional household where the women do all of the housework & she's not going to change.  You are correct, the boys are lazy & should be pitching in.  They're not going to make very good husbands to anyone.  Unfortunately, it sounds like mom is also abusive.  Slapping you & calling you names is abuse.", "NTA. Your mom sucks and favors the brothers, as they often do. Sexism is never right or fair and you are very aware as a 15 year old.", "NTA. But you have to pick your timing. When she's NOT tired, you might have to explain to her that times have changed. You can explain that women have to earn money at a paying job, so if men aren't the ones lifting that burden by themselves as is traditional then they need to also help the women with what's traditionally on them. I doubt her thinking will change but it doesn't hurt to try.", "Info: does your brother sometimes get asked to do chores while you are watching TV ?", "NTA. \n\nBut I totally understand your point and situation.  \nThe guilt of mom is tired but the burst of why I should only work when he is just playing video games. \n\nIt's not your mistake though,  she clearly could have asked her son and may be asked you to help him but she didn't.  She wants only you to. \n\nI suggest you to say that you're ready to do the work but your brother should help you. / \"Me and bro both will do the work together.  I won't do it if he doesn't,  So ask him now\"\n\n  (This kinda pressures people but it's the only way, because it's hard changing people who have been into the traditional way, It was the same for me, but Since i started to take baby steps, it's better now) \n\nIt works all the time\ud83d\ude01\n\n1. You're helping mom\n2. Your bro is also working.", "YTA for the *timing* of your throw down with your mom about how much you rightfully resent your brother\u2019s being allowed to be such a lazy bum. Your mom was an AH for reacting the way she did.", "NTA, and ugh, having experienced such situations while growing up, I know it can get really annoying. Where I'm from, men are praised for carrying their dirty dishes from the table to the sink, which rarely happens anyway. You are branded as disrespectful for pointing it out too. It sucks.", "I dont think even if she talked to her mom when mom was in a good mood will do anything other than get her into more trouble. I agree its unfair but they believe this is how things should be, traditional gender rolls and all that.\nOP this is going to be hard but you need to follow a very simple tactic: smile and nod. Your mom is not going to change and make the brothers do ANYTHING. While you are financially dependent on them, you need to keep your head down and just deal with it. Once you are able, leave. Get a job and your own place. Do NOT stay in that house once you no longer are required to. I see your parents contuing to make you do housework even after you start working full time. They will never make your brothers do their fair share. So make nice, do what you are told and make plans to leave as soon as you are capable. Good luck OP, NTA", "Umm, I had a mom who hit. Op needs not be in the same space for that chat and also be away for at least a week. \n\nVoice of reason is very rare in those creatures. Challenging a parent whilst being dependent on said parent may not be a feasible option.", "No never. Whenever they are asked to do something I am asked to do something.They are mostly asked to help out when we are hosting an event at our house that may take a while to set up for.", "Did you even read the post?", "No, she is setting boundaries!

Do you know how annoying it is to be expected to do all the chores simply because of your genitals? It\u2019s just wrong! People just always want a \u201etraditional\u201c wife without being a traditional man, the brothers do nothing all day, you bet I would start arguing that they better help!!", "Lolololol what are you the mom or something?", "That sucks. NTA, he should be asked to do something when you are asked to do something.", "Exactly! Please do not listen to this person!! Everyone should help around the house! They are grown men who are more than capable of helping and it's embarrassing when grown men don't know how to do housework!! You are NTA and right in your logic!", "Why do you assume the OP is female when they never said so in their post? It sounds like you are the one making sexist assumptions. Also, the basic principle in my reply remains the same - the OP's brothers are AH for not helping their mother when she's tired, but so is the OP. The really sexist thing about this situation is this poor working mother who has to clean up after her lazy children and can't get any help from any of them. If you care about sexism, you should care about the woman in the OP's post who has to both work AND take care of all the housework with no help. Why am I the only one who cares about the woman's rights in this situation?", "Say it louder friend \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "The others are adults. She's a child.", "Lol adults that are not paying rent, not working and barely doing any chores at all. All right then."]}
