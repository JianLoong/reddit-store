While my parents have each lived in America for more than 30 years this has somewhat stuck in their lifestyle today. For about the first 13 years of my life (I am now 15) my mom has been a stay-at-home mom, which I have always been thankful for, but for the past 2 years has been working on and off jobs, mainly in dentists' offices. I understand why, all three of her kids (I have 2 older brothers 20 and 23) are grown. Here's where I may be the ahole. My mom comes home from work one day while I'm on summer vacation and asks me to clean around the kitchen for her because she was tired. I understood where she was coming from and was happy to help AS LONG as she took into consideration that she also had another kid who was doing nothing other than playing video games in his room (I am talking about my 20 yo brother; my 23 yo brother was in Thailand at this time on vacation). My mom and I ended up in a HUGE argument with her slapping me in the leg, cursing me out, calling me trash and useless, and saying that I do nothing around the house which is a blatant lie. Other than what my mom does, I do everything around the house while my brothers, who, reminder, are in their 20s and don't pay rent AND neither of them has a job, do absolutely nothing and just stay in their rooms all day. So Reddit I need to know AITA for not helping my mom in the kitchen. \n\nEdit: I want to make clear that my brothers are asked to help out SOMETIMES. As in maybe once a month.

If your mother is tired n you have the time and energy, just help her out. It might motivate your other brother to join in too. Maybe your mom would\u2019ve asked him to contribute after seeing only you help out. Not clearly an AH as such but not a very good attitude either. \nIs there any reason specifically why she never asks her other sons to help?", "YTA. Regardless of sex, it's the right thing to help your mother around the house, especially given she is tired and working and you are on vacation. Your brothers are also TA for not helping her, but you can't control their actions, only your own. What other people do or don't do has no effect on the ethics of your own actions. She shouldn't have hit you or called you names, that's terrible, but it sounds like she is at her breaking point and really feels overworked and underappreciated. Your whole family should address this together and all of you living at home should have chores and responsibilities around the house instead of making your mother do everything and acting like spoiled brats.", "Yes. YTA. Who cares what the other kid was doing? She asked YOU for help. You sound spoiled.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
