Adults - which is what you seem to want \n     to be - work 2 jobs to afford necessities when the \n     mommy gravy train stops. \n2) In looking at your post history - you post in AITH a \n     lot. Lots of potential AH behavior on your part and \n     you seen very out of touch in general about how \n     your behavior effects others. \n3) You're 21, mom is 38 so she had you a little young.\n4) Fun Mom - prob had no clue how to raise a. \n     productive member of society that can express \n     Empathy for a 70+ yo woman. \n5) Any young mom who talks about her fun mom \n     period prob has narcissistic tendencies and it \n     shows in your entitled ways.\n6) I'd bet that if a neutral third party went thru your \n     bank statements and spending - that you are \n     going out often, paying for expensive drinks and \n     meals in clubs and bars and clothes you cannot \n     afford given your earnings. \n\nI don't think mom is handling this correctly by a long shot and the crap about you abandoning your family if you move to boyfriends place......but its her apartment to sell and you are learning real quick about how the real world works. \n\nWelcome to it!
