From a young age she has been vocal about her distain for cooking and how there are a million better things she could do with her time. She never cared if others were better than her before but she has developed this intense jealousy of my wife because my niblings enjoy my wife's cooking so much.

She said it's the fact they show so much appreciation and love for my wife's food and they never have anything good to say about hers.

I told her she could just stop coming over if she's so jealous about my wife's cooking that she can't be more respectful of her in our home.\n\nMy sister asked if I was kicking her out and I asked if she was going to be respectful.

Not everyone is good at everything, we just have to accept it. I'm terrible in the kitchen, despite trying my best, so when a talented cook asks if they can cook for me, I say \"Hell yeah!\"\n\nI realize if your nibs rave about your wife's cooking at home, it could make your sister feel insecure. But that's not your wife's problem. You don't have to be good at everything, but don't make people who are feel bad about it when you're not.", "NTA sister can put the work into learning if it means that much to her to get validation. It\u2019s not like she has 3 infants. She can even involve the children with age-appropriate prep and cooking tasks.

It sounds like your sister would love to hear some appreciation from her kids about her cooking but seeing your wife receive it makes her feel less than.

That's a lot of meal prep/planning. Sounds like the kids can taste her disdain and resentment in the food she prepares. \n\nMy dad had a buddy (\"Ben\") back in the day whose wife (\"Lena\") would not infrequently call our house to see what we were having for dinner; she hated cooking and would often make chicken fingers/hot dogs/frozen pizza for their 4 kids, but would then try and send her husband to our place to eat a home-cooked meal. Their other go-to would be for Ben to just conveniently show up for a visit right around meal time and just wait to be invited to eat with us. Ben, Lena and my parents all worked full-time jobs, by the way, but Ben was wayyy too sexist to lower himself to learn how to cook a roast or a stew. I don't blame Lena for making easy meals she knew her kids would eat, but I always hated how the two of them used us/my parents to feed a grown man who couldn't be bothered to learn to make the meals he wanted to eat at his own house.", "So NTA at all because your sister is being rude rude rude and there\u2019s nothing wrong with you pointing it out and refusing to tolerate that. but I do feel some sympathy for your sister. Imagine hating a task that you have little choice but to do because you have to feed the kids something on a daily basis and it would be horrible to just do processed reheated crap all the time. And then you never get thanks or appreciation for the work which you do even though you hate it. But you see your kids fawning over someone else, clearly capable of being thankful. Problem here is that you shouldn\u2019t only show gratitude for food when someone does a really good job. I\u2019m not saying they should fake loving it, but at least acknowledge the time she spends on it and saying thanks is a good thing for the kids to learn. My mom is an awesome cook and some times\u2026she misses, hard. I don\u2019t neglect to thank her on those occasions because I know she put in as much time and effort as the instance when that dish turned out good.  None of that is your problem though. It\u2019s something she needs to deal with in her own home. And it\u2019s probably not going to change while she keeps resorting to dumping dinner guests on your poor wife.", "My husband cooks in our home and he does an awesome job. I am dyspraxic and cannot boil water. :) I would not dream of disparaging his or anyone else's cooking if my kids praised it, heck, I'd be eating and praising it too!\n\nYour sister hates cooking, but clearly feels - OR IS MADE TO FEEL - that she should be a good cook in order to be loved/valuable/a proper mother. You are contributing to this. Am I right, OP? THAT is what's hurting her.\n\nShe should own her likes and dislikes and embrace the things she does well. Help her, OP, you are her brother. Tell her that it's okay, and the people around her love and value her, she does not need to fit into a box to be worthy. We are each good at different things and it takes a village to raise three niblings. :)\n\nNTA, and your sister should apologize", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
