Their other go-to would be for Ben to just conveniently show up for a visit right around meal time and just wait to be invited to eat with us. Ben, Lena and my parents all worked full-time jobs, by the way, but Ben was wayyy too sexist to lower himself to learn how to cook a roast or a stew.

Imagine hating a task that you have little choice but to do because you have to feed the kids something on a daily basis and it would be horrible to just do processed reheated crap all the time. And then you never get thanks or appreciation for the work which you do even though you hate it. But you see your kids fawning over someone else, clearly capable of being thankful. Problem here is that you shouldn\u2019t only show gratitude for food when someone does a really good job. I\u2019m not saying they should fake loving it, but at least acknowledge the time she spends on it and saying thanks is a good thing for the kids to learn. My mom is an awesome cook and some times\u2026she misses, hard. I don\u2019t neglect to thank her on those occasions because I know she put in as much time and effort as the instance when that dish turned out good.  None of that is your problem though.

You are contributing to this. Am I right, OP? THAT is what's hurting her.\n\nShe should own her likes and dislikes and embrace the things she does well. Help her, OP, you are her brother.
