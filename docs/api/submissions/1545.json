Does the SIL not work or go out or anything?\n  \nTo be fair, though, Brussels is a large tourist destination, so she probably gets accommodated a lot in restaurants and things. But I would get upset if I was in OP's shoes.", "Because it's one of the official and most spoken languages in Belgium.", "Are you confused by Americans speaking English as well?", "My question is why hasn\u2019t BIL helped his wife learn French?? Them being mad at OP makes them look incredibly entitled. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f NTA.", "NTA. Either she learns the language or someone else translates for her.", "*French* chef\u2019s kiss!", "She doesn't have to go out of her way, she just has to keep attending dinner at the in- laws and try and talk to them!", "*et toi, mary?*\n\n*I  D O N T  S P E A K  F R A N C A I S*\n\n*pardon?*\n\n*ME NO HABLO FRANCAISSSS!!!*", "[deleted]", "She'll be able to order a coffee to calm down... /s", "I live in the US and it\u2019s crazy how people will live here for 10 but not bother to learn the language. The government feels they should have a translator. They even have the drivers license test in a bunch of languages even though road signs are in English. People get upset if they get pulled over and given a ticket because they can\u2019t read English, seems like that would be important.", "No but if I was in a random country like Mexico where they speak Spanish I would be confused if they were speaking French.", "Chef\u2019s *French kiss*?", "JAMBON", "They get a translator because unlike most countries, there is no official language for the United States. \n\nLearning enough words to read road signs isn't difficult, you could do it in a few weeks.", "> Your attitude about this reminds me of people in the US yelling \"You're in America, speak English!\"\n\nSIL is literally the one yelling \"speak English\" at people. Well, not literally yelling: crying and demanding apologies from others for speaking their native language in her presence.\n\nSIL's attitude is the one that has major English native speaker privilege and entitlement written all over it. We regularly see stories like OP's here. Never once have we seen someone moving to the US and marrying an American then demanding that the whole family stop speaking English or that someone be their free lifelong interpret.\n\nIf the situation was reversed, say an American couple with 4 kids, one of which married a Chinese citizen and another married a French one, we would never say 8 people need to make the massive effort to learn both Chinese and French because the 2 married couples can't make a much smaller effort.", "Then why are you confused about Belgians speaking (among other things) French?", "My attitude? I have said twice already SIL should have learned the language of the country she lives in. And I am multi-lingual.\n\nYou came here asking for judgment. I have judged you **not the asshole** and you're still upset because I have dared to also offer a slightly-different perspective on the conflict, unbelievable.\n\nYou win!"]}
