By her choice, she has many family members who are French native speakers, including two monolinguals, and will encounter many other French native speakers in her daily life for the rest of her life. It would make sense for her to make the effort to learn one language to communicate with tons of people, as a result of her choices.

Due to reasons outside of their control, they have one English native speaker (not counting OP who is bilingual) and one Italian native speaker in their family. Learning a new language takes thousands of hours of efforts and it's reasonable for them to think it's not worth learning 2 languages to speak to one person per language.
