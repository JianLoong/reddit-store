I find it annoying that it always falls on me if her husband isn't there, because the rest of the siblings (they have another brother and another sister) find it irritating that she's never made an effort and just don't bother translating anymore).\n\nLast week I was trying to speak to my mother-in-law about something quite personal (my husband and I are trying for children and it's been hard) and Sarah kept asking me to translate for her. It was really starting to annoy me, especially as it was a sensitive conversation and translating it was quite painful, so when we left, I told her that I wasn't going to be the go-between for her anymore. I told her that she lives here and that if she wants to speak to his family, she's going to have to put in *some* effort to learn the language.\n\nEdit: Sorry I forgot to add - after this happened she was apparently in tears with her husband that night, and now both of them are upset with me.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to translate. \n\nIt\u2019s possible your SIL has a learning disability that inhibits her ability to understand a different language. I do, which broke my heart when I was in college because I very much wanted to speak Italian fluently, but despite my best efforts (including private tutoring) I could only understand it if I was reading it or the person speaking it to me went very, very slowly. It was frustrating as hell, and I used to bitterly blame it on US schools not starting kids in languages until they were teenagers (not sure that\u2019s still the case - I hope not), after they had passed the easiest learning window for it.

By her choice, she has many family members who are French native speakers, including two monolinguals, and will encounter many other French native speakers in her daily life for the rest of her life. It would make sense for her to make the effort to learn one language to communicate with tons of people, as a result of her choices. If not, she should accept the consequences of her choice but instead, she is demanding that everyone else kowtow to her, at great efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, the in-laws did not make any choice that would require them to speak a foreign language. Due to reasons outside of their control, they have one English native speaker (not counting OP who is bilingual) and one Italian native speaker in their family. Learning a new language takes thousands of hours of efforts and it's reasonable for them to think it's not worth learning 2 languages to speak to one person per language. If they don't, they also should accept the consequences of their choice, which they do. They are not demanding that SIL learn French or that OP interpret.\n\nIf this were happening in the US, I guarantee we wouldn't expect an entire family to learn, say French and Chinese because one family member married a Chinese national and another married a French one. We would expect the 4 people who chose to enter a bilingual marriage to make a smaller effort rather than expect everyone else to make a gigantic one.\n\nLike I said, I am in a bilingual marriage myself. We've been together for 14 years and none of my in-laws learned my native language, nor have my family learned my spouse's language. I have a French friend married to a Norwegian dude, also for 10+ years, and her family didn't learn Bokm\u00e5l nor did his learn French.
