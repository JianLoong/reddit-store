By her choice, she has many family members who are French native speakers, including two monolinguals, and will encounter many other French native speakers in her daily life for the rest of her life. It would make sense for her to make the effort to learn one language to communicate with tons of people, as a result of her choices.

Due to reasons outside of their control, they have one English native speaker (not counting OP who is bilingual) and one Italian native speaker in their family.

This is actually super common, most interpreters won\u2019t remember what we interpreted because our brain was too busy working at the speed of sound to bother saving any data into medium (or long)-term memory.\n\nYou, as (I\u2019m guessing) not a pro interpreter, will struggle even harder. Interpreting is a trade and it takes years to do it well. And also, you didn\u2019t go to dinner (or whatever) to work, you went to be with your family!\n\nHonestly, if she won\u2019t learn the language she bring (and pay for) her own interpreter to family events and such. You\u2019re honestly saving her hundreds of \u20ac per event, and it\u2019s time she learns that she does need to know more than her coffee order.\n\n(Also, I\u2019ve now been in 2 relationships where I had to learn brand new (to me) languages to fully communicate with my partners. It\u2019s not a big deal, and a cute motivator. I\u2019ve also had partners who wouldn\u2019t learn my language, and I can\u2019t understand why a partner would willingly cut themselves off from my family, music, culture\u2026 big yikes!)", "There's a Dominican woman in my building that's been here for a decade, same thing.

We were in a women's shelter in the same room for a year and she was always talking at you in her language and getting people to translate. \n\nWe got her a dictionary. We got her a translation app. We did everything we could to help her learn English just so she could survive and use the system better to get out of being homeless. No go. She stubbornly refused to learn it. So we finally gave up. \n\nFlash foward I move in and it turns out she's in my building. First thing she does is she gives me her phone and tells me via gestures to put my number in so she can call me whenever she wants. \n\nI said \"Nope. I am not here to translate for you. Until we can have a decent conversation in English there's no point in me being on your phone list. We can barely communicate in person let alone on the phone!\" \n\nWe all did a lot of translating for her when we lived in the same room. No way I'm going to finally be in my own place and have to do translate on call and get roped into doing other stuff for her all the time. \n\nIf I learned anything from being around her for a year it's that you don't want to go there. Supposed lack of English language skills aside she is a whiny, petulant, greedy person who lies a LOT to get what she wants. Honestly I never liked her much to begin with. \n\nI strongly suspect that she can speak at least some English passably well when she wants to and that pretending not to is just part of the way she likes to manipulate people. \n\nI go on a vacation to someplace where I don't speak the language I'd study beforehand and at least attempt to learn some.

It works but it\u2019s not easy.", "I work in a restaurant, and can confirm! Some of my friends in the kitchen speak a mix of Spanish/English, especially in a rush, so you pick up things pretty quickly!", "Lol I didn't read that one !", "Wow TIL. That\u2019s crazy, I didn\u2019t know.", "One of the things people tend to forget, especially with the state of modern US politics, is that the US was meant to be a place where anyone who was oppressed for any reason in their home country can come to enjoy religious and personal freedom. That freedom begins with yourself and ends when it starts to encroach on someone else's. It's generally not a hard concept to understand and yet here we are.", "That ironically sounds like the opposite of modern US.", "Agreed. It's... Disheartening, to say the least.", "NTA. And don't apologize, you just got rid of a burden. Friday dinner is going to be so much more relaxed for you!", "How can she live somewhere for 8 years and not learn the language??? It\u2019s not even a matter of \u201cmaking an effort\u201d, she is surrounded by this language. At this point she\u2019s doing it on purpose. Geez\u2026.  NTA.", "NTA Speaking as an American - I assume her English speaking homeland is America...", "Aww. They will be missed at these family gatherings I\u2019m sure. NTA.", "NTA. I married an Arab man and its the same situation. English IS everywhere here and a ton of people speak it except for the older folks. I had to learn if I wanted to be able to communicate and really become part of the family/community. She's really losing out on these connections. I hope she realizes this.", "NTA - Disrespectful to the man she married and his family as well as self-limiting since you can't fully part-take in a culture without knowing the language. I think it's great you spoke up OP.", "NTA plus it sounds like things might be easier if they aren't at dinner", "How rude to interrupt that particular conversation", "NTA. SIL is mad about being held accountable and BIL is mad because he\u2019s lost his translator. After 7/8 years she should at least be able to speak at an elementary level if not more.", "NTA", "NTA. They have solved the problem for you! Don\u2019t apologize and they won\u2019t attend family get togethers! So no translation is needed.", "NTA", "NTA. Go ahead and apologize but don\u2019t translate for her anymore.", "NTA I would only converse in French when I am around her from now. It's on her after 8 yrs if she doesn't want to learn the language her husband's family speaks.", "NTA\nYou\u2019ve been doing this for 8 years. She\u2019s TA", "He's mad at you because he wants you to do his job??", "NTA. She should have learned French a long time ago. Her husband needs to teach her or sit and translate for her.", "You do not owe her an apology. You did the right thing telling her the truth and having this boundary. NTA", "NTA, call their bluff. They said they won't go to anything you go to until you apologize.  They can't force the family to stop inviting you, and they know it.  When they start attending again, ignore them. They get nothing from you until they apologize, for being petty and entitled.  And even then, only if they both apologize in French.", "NTA. You don't have to translate anything for her. Like you said she can choose to do whatever she wants. It's her choice not to learn. However that will have consequences. Like not being able to talk or connect to people who Don't speak English. Until now she hasn't had any consequences for her actions coz you or her husband were always there. She's just realising now that she won't have any way to talk or communicate with her in laws if her husband isn't there. You don't have to apologise. They probably don't want to come coz she can't understand the language and hence cannot talk and the husband doesn't want to spend the entire evening translating for her. This has nothing to do with you. Enjoy your life.", "Plus why is it OP's problem? Apparently every one else in the family is refusing to translate anymore so really BIL and SIL should be angry with everyone not just OP.", "Belgium as a whole is the place I felt most comfortable practicing French as everyone was nice and welcoming of imperfect French, especially older people in Dutch speaking parts, who learned French as a second language and never learned or don\u2019t feel confident in English.", "And why isn't BIL doing ALL the interpreting?  If Sarah won't learn French, surely he knows English. \n\nHe shouldn't expect to be able to dump any kids off on OP (without OP's explicitly agreeing) and he shouldn't expect to dump his exhausting wife on OP, either.\n\nBesides, French is one of the easier languages for English-speakers to learn.", "In some countries, it is pretty easy to avoid learning the language. I live in the Netherlands and whenever you are out, they switch to English the minute they hear your accent. For some people the anxiety of not getting the language right makes it really hard for them to speak it. I refused to speak Dutch at work because every time I tried, people laughed at my accent or pronunciation. For someone with anxiety about speaking a language, that could make them stop attempting. \n\nI felt this way my first non-English speaking country, but somewhere along the line I stopped caring what people think about my language skills. As long as people aren't annoying about it (like at work), I will muddle along as well as I can.\n\ntl;dr it is complicated", "I don't understand it either. But I live in South Florida and many people (nearing close to majority) here cannot speak English. I know some who have been here 20 plus years and still say *no English* in response to everything said to them.\nIt makes it very hard when they are working with the public bc if you don't speak their language you have a hard time getting service. I've been turned away several times at major chain businesses because they couldn't understand English and no one was nearby to translate for me. \nIt can be extremely frustrating, so I get that on a family level it would be even worse. SIL should've desired a relationship with her in laws years ago and therefore picked up on enough to be able to communicate with them..at very least", "You guys don\u2019t like it when people try to learn French either tho", "This! Makes me wonder if sil is American.", "Ah so it\u2019s just that easy to learn other languages if you don\u2019t have brain damage and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re \u201clazy and entitled\u201d So your husband is just \u201clazy and entitled\u201d because he doesn\u2019t know Spanish then right\n\nYou don\u2019t even know if this person has something similar to you but yet you just make the assumption they\u2019re \u201clazy and entitled\u201d", "As an American, my response to this is, obviously she is.", "OK for abuelita but I feel Iike the oldies get a pass, she's probably got a few years on OPSs SIL", "Wut..... We literally give free french classes to immigrants but ok....", "I guess technically at the federal level? Close to 80% speak English though. I say English, but it is really a mix of English and American English. Apparently it is officially up to the individual states. Doesn't change the fact that the majority speak English. \n https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/997/text\n\nThat said, I personally hate it. Due to our neighbors in the North and South, I don't see why Spanish and/or French isn't taught from an early age. I am extremely jealous of other countries and that students are typically bi/tri lingual at an early age. Not to mention how much easier it is to learn a language, the younger you are. Then throw in, I feel everyone should know some basic sign language too. It would break barriers in many ways.", "Kek. I read that as \"hoot\", and I was like \"isn't that a quick reference?\" I need sleep \ud83e\udd23.", "That\u2019s a down under kiss", "It was something like \"AITA for getting mad my gf ate all the leftovers?\"   Where his subtle wording made it out that he was upset at her weight gain. Then someone snooped his comments. Found one from a porn sub asking a girl to make her asshole wink for him. It's an imgur link to the screenshot since he deleted the comments as soon as it got called out.", "Oooh my goodness \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
