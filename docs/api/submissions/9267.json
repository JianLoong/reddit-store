Not picking up the kid wasn't necessarily the wrong thing because you obviously assumed her mum had arranged to pick her up, and the way she reacted was wrong. But seriously, your attitude and the way you talk about the child is really telling. If you can't have control over your jealousy and take out your bad feelings on a literal child you shouldn't have made some ridiculous arrangement with your husband for the two of you to go out raw dogging randoms. Sounds like both of you suck and can't handle the consequences of your stupid decisions. \n\nYou pass all the judgement onto a literal child but its you and your husband's bad ideas that birthed this situation she is in, not her.

Plus, baby mama doesn't want her kid alone with you. It is not your responsibility to pick up a child that wasn't even staying with you. The sad part is that this girl is in the middle of it all. Your husband needs to try to intervene and help his daughter. Maybe therapy or something.", "> My husband was fine with it and he informed my stepdaughter\u2019s mother. \n\nDo you know he informed her? If this actually happened then NTA.

She told you from the start she doesn't want you aline with her child.  You told her weren't picking her up.

So she doesn't go behind your back to cause issues to make you look bad.", "NTA.\n\nHere's what I think happened.\n\nHusband did communicate to biomom OP wouldn't be taking his visitation weekend because he would off on a business trip.  Biomom would need to make arrangements for getting her kid from school on Friday.\n\nBiomom ignored this intentionally and tried to force OP or her nanny to back to the school to retrieve the kid.

The kid is HIS responsibility on the weekends he has custody. He is free to try to negotiate with the mom for the kid to stay with her during his custody time, but if she says no he has to figure it out. It is no different than if you are a single parent and have a work trip - you have to figure out what to do with your kid while you are gone.", "\"Welcome to being a parent?\" Really?

Dad's hardly a parent to this child.", "AND the mother had made it very clear that she doesn't want her kid around OP without the father around...", "Especially since some custody agreements have this literally baked into the terms. If the custodial parent is unavailable for their time it reverts to the other parent not the spouse", "Yeah, but it is up to the parent who is supposed to have the kid at that time to figure out child care. Not OPs responsibility, but it is the dad\u2019s. The kid is his responsibility during the time period that he is supposed to have custody. That doesn\u2019t change just because he has a work trip. If he can\u2019t be there, he needs to figure out who can take care of her during that time.\n\nThis is no different than if he was a single parent and needed to go somewhere for work\u2026 You have to figure out care for your child.", "NTA - You are not her parent, it's not your responsiblity to manage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepending on the circumstances, the parent with custody time has to make arrangements and is responsible (could mean OP hasa to take regardless, or other arrangements).  But, even with that, saying \"I can't\" and dad and mom shoudl have come to some arrangements.  In this instance OP is just around when the two main people decide.  OP can't even technically make a decision.", "The OP's qualms with taking her stepdaughter for the weekend are understandable. Where my problem lies is that if it's the husband's custody time, it's also his responsibility to coordinate child care if he's not available. Absent an emergency, that should not involve unilaterally dictating a change to the custody arrangment.", "My bet is on this.", "He is welcome to say that to the ex - \u201chey, I have a work trip during my custody weekend so my wife will be taking care of our kid. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with this, she can stay with you instead\u201d, and then go with whatever the ex decides. It is still different than just informing her, though.", "If the kid actually listened to OP & didn't disrespect her as a parental figure in her own home, I don't think this would have been an issue. Custody arrangements are for the parent & child to continue their relationship, not always for the child to spend time with their half/step siblings.", "When I was party to a custody agreement, if our son had an event (school, sports, or social) on a weekend he was scheduled to be at Dad's, or if my ex had a conflicting obligation, we *switched weekends*. This hasn't even been mentioned. If he sees his child one weekend per month, and skips this month, does that mean he'll have seen her for only one weekend over two months??", "Typical custody agreements state, in essence, the custodial parent has to make the child(ren) available for specific visitation times with the non-custodial parent.  The non-custodial parent, however, doesn't have to take advantage of his or her allotted time.\n\nIn the scenario you proposed, yes, the mother would be expected to make her own childcare arrangements unless OP and her husband agreed to take the extra time with the child.", "Exactly. Seeing your parent a max of 2 days per month isn't going to give you the time to create a meaningful relationship.", "THIS!!!!   My ex was incessantly dicking with our custody schedule at the last minute and it drove me insane!  I would make plans for my non-custody weekend then he would call 10 minutes before he was supposed to pick up our child and say he had to work late and wouldn't be there until the next morning. Or he had something come up and couldn't get him at all that weekend.  Sometimes he wouldn't call at all.  \n\nIf you are a non-custodial parent, it is YOUR responsibility to find child care or make transportation arrangements, etc. for YOUR scheduled time.  If you and the custodial parent can agree on something, fine.  But you CANNOT just let the kid sit at school or on the porch steps or at the soccer game because you had to work etc.  This is entirely unacceptable and both parents' attorneys need to get involved if it is going to keep happening.", "I'm wondering about that too. It's already so little time, and the post makes it sound like the weekend was skipped rather than switched, but maybe info is missing.", "If the child support is based on 50/50 custody, and one parent declines their parenting time, the support payments need to be recalculated. The way you are describing it, one parent could \"choose not to take advantage\" of their time, and still pay a reduced amount to the parent who has the child 100% of the time.", "I am wondering if the dad even talked to the child's mom or just left a voicemail or forgot. It's easy to vilify the mom, but we don't even know what information she had.", "That\u2019s literally\u2026 abandoned??", "It would help to know:\n\nDid hubby actually *have* a conversation with bio-mom?\n\nDid they *agree* or did he tell her *this is how it is going to be*?\n\nWhat *specifically* was agreed to?", "I don't believe this is a 50/50 situation since the father sees the kid one weekend a month.  It seems biomom has primary custody and dad gets visitation.", "It sounds like she was abandoned by her own actual mother so how is that ops fault? The mom had the information, The mom knew that her daughter was not going to be spending the weekend at her dad's. Sounds like it's on mom not stepmom.", "You meant abandoned by her bio mother? I thought you meant OP", "Are you married? Because that\u2019s not how it works. The custody order is between the mom and dad. Unless it\u2019s in there that OP has to pick the kid up if dad can\u2019t, she holds no obligation for it, married or not. Just because you\u2019re married, it doesn\u2019t mean your spouse\u2019s responsibilities are yours.", "She was a fwb, now she is an ex.", "I don't consider fwb an ex as its not much of relationship besides sex.", "Hahaha contempt of what? Court? Ok never mind, you have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nCourts cannot force a parent to take their custody days, and absolutely cannot force visitation. It would not be safe for a child to be with a parent that does not want to be with them. Courts *can* and *do* enforce child support, and you *can* get in trouble for not paying it. But that\u2019s about it.\n\nAlso, no, I would not check on a child being picked up if I have been informed the schedule has been changed and the child is with her mother, their legal and biological parent. I might double check with my husband that arrangements have been made, which is what OP did. \n\nBut I would not message the mom. It would not my place to do so, and if anything the mother could turn on OP and say something like *\u201dwhat, you don\u2019t think I can take care of my own kid?\u201d.*\n\nIn hostile situations, stepparents learn to stay in their lanes really fast.\n\nBut no, a non custodial parent missing visitation is not something that qualifies as \u201ccontempt\u201d.", "I mean, I do think overall that's for the best. It sounds like the dad is the one trying to force overnight visits. If he keeps behaving this way, the mom shouldn't have any issues getting a court to reduce this back to a few hours a month and get more child support instead.", "You\u2019re right my parents didn\u2019t get court orders, they couldn\u2019t even manage mediation. They did all their \u2018talking\u2019 through lawyers/ bagging them out to family so it got back to the other person. They got divorced two decades ago and still can\u2019t be in a room together. My situation or how you grew up doesn\u2019t mean the adults in THIS situation shouldn\u2019t be working on themselves/ therapy/ relationships ect to be better and aren\u2019t AH for creating and maintaining a hostile environment. I get that\u2019s hard.. The very lowest acceptable level should be being able to communicate enough that a young child isn\u2019t neglected/ scared/ alone because the ADULTS couldn\u2019t be responsible.", "That sucks that you grew up in this situation. My parents are still married to each other, but I am in a situation where my husband shares custody of a child with his ex.\n\nThe child turned out not to be his, but a product of an affair his ex had during the marriage. He raised the child for some time, but then they moved. He still pays child support, and gets tricked into all sorts of drama. \n\nSo I can look at this from the stepmom\u2019s perspective. If I were to check with my stepdaughter\u2019s mom that she got picked up or dropped off or anything while SD is with mom, I would 100% be told to stay on my lane, that I\u2019m *not* the mom.\n\nSo as a default, I let my husband do the talking. It\u2019s better this way. If he told me it was handled, I would believe him. Despite knowing that most likely, my stepdaughter\u2019s irresponsible mom would let her down somehow. But it\u2019s not my place to intervene. I have absolutely *no rights*."]}
