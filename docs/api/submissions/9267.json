But seriously, your attitude and the way you talk about the child is really telling.

Business trips typically mean business meetings, business lunches, business dinners, etc.  What would dad do with the kid if he took her?", "Really only if there is some fault in the sterilization process.\n\nIn the past with vasectomy they just would cut the vas deferens and call it good, but there were instances where the things reconnected or sperm somehow made it's way from one to the other anyway.\n\nNow they cut them and cauterize both ends of each one.\n\nThen of course after a vasectomy the guy has to ejaculate a number of times to remove all the live sperm in the ejaculate. They give you tests for this and if you don't make sure before going back in, well, enjoy pregnancy.\n\nAnecdotally, I was with my wife for many years before we decided to have a kid. She used the pill for all that time. She got off the pill, people tell us, oh it could take months. Two weeks later she was pregnant, so everything was working. I got the vasectomy after and we're sitting on 11 years no issues.", "The mom not telling the father that the child exists for 3 years is even worse parenting.", "Yeah it's seems like the husband doesn't really give a shit about his daughter, you'd think he'd make some effort to rectify his own scheduling conflict.", "Because OP was the one who had to raise that she was uncomfortable being left with the kid, not her husband.", "Man you\u2019re under my comments telling *me* to stop saying there\u2019s no evidence for the absolute hogwash you\u2019re coming up with. \n\nIf OP has left out *vital* context it\u2019s not my responsibility to do mental gymnastics to justify her deadbeat husband\u2019s behaviour lol.", "Oh geeze, even worse", "If what OP is saying actually happened (which some people are pointing out she's leaving out information) then yes the mom should not have done what she did. But the mom has the kid 90% of the time so... I wouldn't say she's dumping all responsibility on a usual basis.", "How he he tell her was she given a say.. did he leave a voice mail and expect her to hear it. Is advance an hour before pick up?", "you also clearly don\u2019t know how custody works, it\u2019s exactly that if one parent cannot take of child other parent does, dad couldn\u2019t take care of kid so it falls to bio mom. exactly like someone else said if OP were to pick up daughter there\u2019s no telling what vio mom would\u2019ve claimed.", "and dad isn\u2019t there, why worsen the relationship between all when daughter clearly doesn\u2019t like OP. yeah you sounds like a bitter baby mama, it\u2019s okay you\u2019ll get picked one day bae don\u2019t worry", "You obviously have no clue how parenting plans work, nor how hard it is to share custody with an ex that damns you if you do, and damns you if you don't. So, please hush.", "Tubal ligation also poses problems. Eggs explode out of the ovary, the fallopian tubes float fairly freely and will grab an egg regardless of where it's from. Cut + cauterization doesn't even cover the entire base there, as it's still possible for implantation of an egg in fallopian tissue or other tissue (although this will be ectopic as the tissue it implants in just isn't the uterus). Rare, but it can happen, and I personally know someone who went through it.\n\nUncertain I would call this a fault in the process, but I think I would concede that it is. I wonder if methods have changed since my family member got hers to a more fully blocked or whole fallopian tube removal. Curious. The human body is horrifying.", "For sure. They both suck, and I feel so bad for that kid.", "Is it fair to say he has no regard when the bio mom didn\u2019t even have the decency to tell him he had a daughter until she was 3yo? I think that gives us a lot of perspective of the person the bio mom is.", "That's exactly the vibe I got...they fought for this one weekend a month (because they could have refused visitation altogether) and can't even keep it up regularly. \n\nNo wonder the little girl hates it there - she has no regularity, probably gets treated differently than her half-siblings, etc.", "I'm a lawyer and that's not how custody works in any jurisdiction I'm aware of. But okay, I guess it makes total sense that a parent can just decide that they are too busy to parent so someone else has to do it whether they consent or not...\n\nIn my professional experience that's the way to loose custody.", "Is she not capable of texting or emailing back? Or picking up a phone?", "No one has said all men are bad. You\u2019re so desperate to turn this into a gendered discussion and it just isn\u2019t. \n\nCustodial parent failed to make adequate ~~predations~~ (edit:preparations) on several occasions, even if we imagine his contact with birth mother was perfectly executed. \n\nHe (1) failed to plan for a situation in which his wife, co-parent *and* child would be uncomfortable, relying on his wife to raise an objection. \n\n(2) was uncontactable when there was an issue *during his custodial time*.\n\nEdit: can\u2019t respond to the below user for some reason. \n\nHe has physical custody of the child for one weekend a month - that\u2019s not a visitation, or at least not where I\u2019m from. Not sure about legal custody as OP doesn\u2019t make reference to this. \n\nBeing uncontactable for a prolonged period of time - to the point where other people are contacted on your behalf - with *no forewarning to either of the mothers of your children* is not responsible parenting. I\u2019m sure during your non-contactable periods you have back-up plans in place eg if there\u2019s an emergency right? That\u2019s the responsible course of action.", "Allllll righty then.  I hope OP makes note of this.\n\nAs I've pointed out several times on this thread, biomom has to make the kid available at the scheduled times, dad doesn't HAVE to take his visitation.\n\nWhat do you think happens when a non-custodial parent simply doesn't show up for visitation?  The custodial parent can't do a damn thing about it except document the dates when it happens, and go back to court for a CS adjustment.", "Dad is the non-custodial parent, and OP said it's not a common thing for him to miss his visitation.\n\nI'm in plenty of situations throughout the day where I can't be reached.  You're making it sound like dad intentionally ignored biomom's call(s).  You have no proof of that.", "One time and you call him a deadbeat. Nobody but you is doing too much. Get some therapy sweetie you're ridiculous", "The custodial parent is biomom.  She was the one who failed to make adequate preparations in this instance.  I'm not sure where you got the idea dad had been the one who didn't make preparations \"on several occasions.\"\n\nWhether or not you think one weekend a month is visitation is irrelevant.  That's the situation at hand. \n\nYou don't know long the dad was unreachable.  None of us do.", "Child support isn't always calculated on percentage of time spent with each parent, especially under a 20-25% minimum threshold of time in many states.\n\nSome states and jurisdictions calculate every single day, but a lot of them will just use the same number regardless of time, unless the noncustodial parent has the child for a fifth or more of the year.", "That's not how it works in many, many jurisdictions. \n\nSource: not how it works in jurisdictions handling CS for my kids.", "1. Had no contact with the child until she www three years old and *conceived her while married to someone else.*\n\n2. Only sees child ONE WEEKEND A MONTH. \n\n3. Dumped child on his wife when that weekend was no longer convenient for him (despite that being a non-optimal situation for child, wife, other children AND co-parent) \n\n4. When it was pointed out to him that that situation wasn\u2019t viable, \u201ccommunicated\u201d to birth mother that she would have to take her\u2026but no mention of follow-up, other arrangements, make-up weekends that OP *definitely would/should have included if they had happened*. \n\n5. Doesn\u2019t appear to have communicated to his wife if bio-mother responded or acknowledge his \u201ccommunication\u201d at all. \n\n6. This could also suggest he didn\u2019t check himself - putting his child at risk. \n\n7. Made himself uncontactable to both mothers of his children for a sufficiently prolonged period of time that other people wound up becoming involved. In the interim *his child* was stranded at school. \n\nSo thanks for your condescending \u201csweetie\u201d but I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re another one of those deadbeat dads. Don\u2019t hope that I get therapy, pay for it for the kids you\u2019ve undoubtedly been an insufficient parent towards. \n\nAnd blocked for being extremely dull, repetitive, and quite frankly not worth the bother.\n\nCan\u2019t respond to the user below: \n\nLol you\u2019ve literally agreed with me on 3 - he was planning on leaving kid with his wife despite no-one else being ok with it. \n\n4 - the information that he made alternative arrangements isn\u2019t given, so therefore I\u2019m comfortable saying that he didn\u2019t make alternative arrangements. It\u2019s making something up to say he did, lol. \n\n5 - yes, he needs confirmation that his child has a safe and willing caregiver. Jesus Christ. \n\n7 - weren\u2019t you just having a paddy about making things up from information not in the post? And also, ok then he should *make alternative arrangements in the case of an emergency like a responsible fucking parent!!!*", "My mistake. Mine was 30 years ago and that was how it worked then. They took our incomes and our percentage of time with the child to arrive at the amount that he paid me.", "careful, you're stretching so much you're about to pull a muscle", "1. Had a consensual relationship, with everyone aware and consenting. Get over it.\n2. WENT TO COURT TO GET A CUSTODY ORDER IN PLACE once he was made aware of his daughter.\n3. As a mom with split custody, I don\u2019t want my kids staying with my ex\u2019s family if he\u2019s not there, and that is especially true when he\u2019s away for work.\n4. If you don\u2019t like providing judgment based solely on what info is given, perhaps find a different subreddit to judge on. All you\u2019ve done is reach and make stuff up.\n5. His job is to communicate with bio mom that he can\u2019t take custody (because again, *he\u2019s not there!*), not wait for her to agree that he can\u2019t take custody. Again, I deal with this kind of situation regularly. Bio mom doesn\u2019t get to tell him he can\u2019t do his job, and honestly neither can you.\n6. Again with the REACH!\n7. Many many many jobs limit communication. My last job we couldn\u2019t have phones inside the building at all. Personal email was also restricted. My ex has no phone and limited email every time he goes for his military stuff. It\u2019s really not uncommon!", "Yeah, in our specific jurisdiction, it was a base amount unless noncustodial had at least 90 days out of the year, or 25% of the time."]}
