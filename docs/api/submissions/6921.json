{"id": 6921, "submission_id": "107mmss", "title": "AITA for selling my husband's gaming setup?", "selftext": "I (F28) used to have a great relationship with my husband (M29). We got along well, had several common interests, etc. However, our relationship began to take a turn over the last year after he started streaming video games on Twitch. At first it was just a hobby for him, but soon he began to get consumed by streaming. For example, while at first he'd only stream a couple days a week for a few hours at a time, around late November he began spending nearly every minute he wasn't at work streaming (he doesn't stream for money). During this time, we also stopped spending nearly as much time together and our relationship predictably deteriorated. I tried talking to him multiple times about how I felt about how little time he was spending with me and finding alternative hobbies, but they all fell on deaf ears and nothing significant changed. \n\nLast week, my husband told me he was sick and that he needed to take a few days to recover. I asked if he wanted me to stay back from a short business trip I was going on to take care of him, but he told me it wasn't necessary. Something about his tone didn't sit right with me, so on a hunch I installed a small camera in his gaming room that'd allow me to see into it. Sure enough, he'd spent every waking minute while I was gone gaming. When I came back, I was furious with him and decided to take a drastic move to fix his problem. When he went for work the next day, I sold his gaming setup and waited for him to get back. \n\nAfter he got back, he immediately saw that his setup was gone and realized what I did. He started yelling at me for taking away his only hobby, and I responded by calling him an addict who only cared about his streaming, pointing out all the times he'd neglected me in favor of gaming and telling him that I knew he'd blown off work to stream. We argued for a little while more, and then I gave him an ultimatum - I told him where I'd sold his setup and that there was a 48 hour return policy, so he could go get it. However, that would necessitate moving out, as I wouldn't stay with him unless he got help for his habit. Long story short, he got his gaming setup then went to stay with a friend.", "created_utc": 1673290756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107mmss/aita_for_selling_my_husbands_gaming_setup/", "score": 283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are much better ways this could have been handled.  Sounds like the two of you need to get into counseling so you can better learn how to communicate with one another.", "ESH\n\nYour husband has abandoned you for his hobby.  AH\n\nYou sold his property without his permission.  AH\n\nHowever, you are now free from his BS.  You will be double AH, this time to yourself, if you don't follow through with the divorce.  \n\nGood luck.", "ESH - I mean did you really think your ultimatum was going to work? After going behind his back to sell his stuff and you expected him to be fine with it?", "ESH. You really should have just talked to him and delivered your ultimatum rather than sell the gear. I'm glad he was able to get it back, but that was drastic and over the line. Good luck on your impending divorce and I'm sorry for you both.", "Feels like a solid ESH.\n\nLike... I understand why you were so frustrated, he was being an AH in there. But selling his stuff was an AH move for you.  \n\n\nSadly when dealing with addiction (which is what this sounds like) all you can do is stop enabling him (not selling the stuff, but stop covering for him, or if serious break up/divorce). So in the end I think this went the only way it could have gone until he realizes and seeks the help he needs. I'm sorry that'll mean a lot of money but divorce was probably the only option no matter what with how deep down the rabbit hole he is.", "ESH.\n\nDid you really think this was going go save your marriage ?", "Ultimatums don't work. Surprising someone by getting rid of their possessions?  Also doesn't work. Ever. \n\nYou're absolutely the asshole.", "ESH. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re a video game widow. It\u2019s not fair to you and I know your relationship has suffered, but communication and counseling are what is needed, not hidden cameras and drastic moves.", "ESH\n\nYou could have delivered the ultimatum without selling his gear. Instead of the discussion being about your very real, very valid concerns, it became about your theft. And it will now always be about your theft, every time it\u2019s raised, whether between you or when he\u2019s talking with others.", "I'm not sure lol I'm sort of torn on this one, but leaning towards ESH. It's hard to maintain a relationship with someone when you spend every minute you aren't working just focusing on your hobby, no matter what it is. It's good to have hobbies, but also needs to be a balance. If you're flat out neglecting your relationship, don't be surprised when it fails. \n\nI'd say you're sort of AH for the way you went about it, it comes off as controlling and over the top aggressive when you could have just said cut back and get help or I'm gone. He doesn't need to eliminate the hobby altogether, just cut back and make time for your relationship. Just imagine if you were big into fitness and worked out lots and came home one day to find he sold all your weights and equipment then dropped an ultimatum on you. I get where you're coming from, just not the best way to handle it.", "ESH. Your frustration is valid. He's TA for neglecting you. You're TA for selling what isn't yours. Neither of you are handling this situation in a healthy manner.", "ESH... wow", "You're absolutely the asshole.", "If you're real, you're a massive AH.", "ESH but more heavily leaning YTA. You functionally stole your husbands stuff. He may have a problem, but the only thing your stunt achieved was getting him pissed off at you. There are plenty of better ways to have handled this, and if you actually were trying to salvage your relationship, you fucked that up.", "As a woman, YTA.", "YTA.\n\nDude has a hobby, one that he prefers over you. Take the hint and move on.", "YTA...\n\nWhy didnt you just leave him? Spying on him and stealing isn't a good look!", " \"Something about his tone didn't sit right with me, so on a hunch I installed a small camera in his gaming room that'd allow me to see into it.\"\n\nI'm not arguing that your husband doesn't have a problem, but you can't force an addict to stop doing whatever they're addicted to, first of all and second of all, if someone is sick, why can't they play video games?  As a kid, when I stayed home sick, I too would play video games...doesn't mean he wasn't sick.\n\nESH honestly...your husband sounds like a shit husband, but you don't sound any better...spying on him and forcing him to do what you think he should do...yikes...", "ESH", "YTA.  You should have got your own hobby or something instead of selling all of his stuff behind his back. That was a huge betrayal and now he knows he can't trust you. Hopefully he doesn't come back.", "YTA. You shouldn't have sold his gaming setup.", "Play stupid games... YTA", "YTA.\n\nWhat did you hope to accomplish here?\n\nIs your intention to end the relationship?  Because effectively that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done.", "Yeah you are an asshole", "ESH - He for gamming too much and it wasn't right to sell his stuff.  You could have disconnected it and had the conversation about your feelings/future.   You felt pushed to install a secret camera, disconnect and sell his stuff?   I think deep down you are doing desperate things to hold onto something that a part of you already knows the answers to. The things you have done are what a person who thinks their spouse is cheating, or who is abusing alcohol or drugs does to prove a point to the cheater/user and get them to stop.  But anyone who has dealt with those kinds of issues will tell you -- Ultimatums don't work because the person is too far down the rabbit hole for common sense to prevail.  Make up your mind what YOU want; married or not to a man that puts gaming before you. Act on that vs spending energy trying to 'show him' what he is doing wrong.   You do you, let him do himself...", "ESH, spying and secretly selling. I mean I get it, I wanted to smash my partner's set up at one point, but that wasn't the right thing to do.\n\nGood luck on your marriage", "YTA. So you sold his stuff and set up a camera to watch him without his knowledge and forced him to either accept that or move out of the house? Did you consider the many other things that could have happened before it got to this point? Limiting internet access, parental controls, marriage counseling, disconnecting the setup and storing it elsewhere. It\u2019s not all right that he\u2019s neglecting the relationship but that doesn\u2019t justify your actions. If the setup was a PC, did you even consider that it might have personal and financial information on there that should have been deleted before you just sold it to a third party? Would it have been okay for him to sell any of your stuff while you\u2019re gone because of behavior he didn\u2019t like? Would it have been okay for him to sell your purse with your wallet in it? This is all short-sighted and the spying is strange and this never would have made the situation better. Did you really expect him to just accept his stuff being sold and become a better husband? This was fuel on a fire.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have sold his property. You could have easily given him an ultimatum to get rid of it himself or leave.", "Some people might give you a hard time for exactly how you handled this, but honestly I get it. Were there more ideal ways to give him this ultimatum? Maybe. But he was married to you, he made vows, and he's been throwing all that away for his gaming addiction. It was a drastic step, but hardly insane.\n\nAlso, you gave him the option of keeping the gaming system if he really wanted, which it looks like he took. I'm sorry you're going through this OP. Good luck.\n\nNTA.", "ESH\n\nI have a boyfriend who games a lot in his freetime, but he still makes effort to talk and call with me (we are long-distant) and tries his best to care for me.\n\nI can understand how you feel, as he had a VRchat addiction, I made him quit aka dislike playing it anymore, but I won't go into detail of that.  \n\n\nHowever I never made him quit gaming entirely, gaming can be nice but he should not neglect you  \n\n\nhe is a AH for neglecting and ignoring you  \nYou are a AH for doing theft  \n\n\nyou need couple therapy or get a divorce, this is a extremly unhealthy and toxic relationship", "YTA. You talk with your significant other and ask for therapy.  If you've tried this and it hasn't worked, you can give the ultimatum and leave.  You never sell your significant other's  belongings.  Theft was easier than either of those things?  It's over anyways from what it sounds like.   There's too many people that go straight to theft or destruction.  Just end it if the communication isn't working.", "NTA\n\nNote the male gamers calling you the asshole.  \n\nYou had to make a stand, and an ultimatum is necessary for an addict. The way you sold it gave him 48 hours to make a decision so it wasn't irreversible.  \n\nHe has chosen gaming over you, he was always going to choose gaming, so now you can get on with your life.", "YTA, why chase after someone that doesn\u2019t care about you? Why not just leave?", "YTA.  But he's also one.  You shouldn't have sold it without his permission.  If you were going to issue an ultimatum, you should've done it before selling his gaming set up and walked when he picked his game over you.", "YTA\n\nI think there are 2 options.\n\n1. You don't mean to be the ah. You seem desperate to save your marriage tbh. Your husband has a problem and isn't ready to  admit it yet. If that is the case, it might help to get  friends or family members of his involved to speak to him. It is gonna take more than you to help him.\n\n2. You are the actual ah and have driven him towards gaming/streaming, meaning there are issues under the surface that we have not been made aware of. \n\nRegardless, selling his stuff and kicking him out for retrieving his stuff is a shit move and may well have tipped you over the point of no return. If my husband would steal my stuff, sell it, and tell me to get out if I get my stuff back, I would have filed for a divorce on the spot.", "A but ESH but mostly YTA. I get your frustration, but we learn when we are toddlers not to do stuff like this. You need a reminder. He needs help with an addiction. It\u2019s like when families of hoarders just throw their stuff out, you haven\u2019t solved anything and just compounded the issue, making the person more likely to cling to their behavior out of a sense of control.", "YTA - if my wife sold anything of mine without asking that would be a pretty much unforgivable offense.  Get ready for the divorce. This is all on you.", "ESH, but YTA way more than he is. \n\nAnd with all that's said here, I have to wonder if there is a reason why he's gaming this much and avoiding you. I mean, the guy is sick, didn't ask for your help, but apparently he's not allowed to game all day? What the hell else is he supposed to do while sick? But you spied on him to see if that's what would happen, got pissed about it, sold all his shit, and expected him to drop a hobby cold turkey.... dafuq you think was gonna happen?", "YTA. He is very clearly an addict, and I'd even agree with you that he needs an intervention. But you went too far by selling his stuff without permission, and then again by slapping him with an ultimatum.", "So you stole from him, then demanded he either move out or accept that you are a thief and stay? Wow, YTA big time.\n\nThis is not how adults handle problems.", "YTA for spying on him and then selling his property while he's gone. Your actions eroded his trust in you and took away the safety, security, and stability one should feel while in their home. So you did this so he'd spend more time with you? Well, that backfired as now you're all alone. Spouses should have trust and mutual respect for each other. Neither of you do, but you're the asshole for acting like you're his parent and not his wife. You don't unilaterally get to decide how someone else lives their life or spends their time.", "Absolutely YTA.\n\nYou went well beyond the argument to selling HIS property. He definitely needed to be away from you", "What did you honestly think would happen? He resorted to gaming for his peace. He clearly wasnt willing to change that. So you thought taking his property and getting rid of it would spark some romantic fire in him to be with you more? You literally just ruined your marriage that quite honestly shouldve been over awhile ago if you werent happy. I wonder why he spends so much time streaming", "YTA... was there a point that you thought this was somehow going to save your marriage?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are the AH here.", "YTA\nNever sell other people's stuff, especially something as expensive as a gaming computer set up. \nDo you want to deal with legal troubles?  Some are expensive enough for you to land in felony theft charges. (I know nothing about the details and it varies by country/state I assume). \nJust leave him, done. Why would you do something as stupid as stealing his gaming rig and selling it. Just why. Revenge?  It's. Not. Worth. It. \nIt would not \"fix\" him. He does not prioritize you anymore. Getting rid of his computer will not make him want to spend time with you more. Divorce/seperation is the way to go if you don't meet each other's needs anymore.", "YTA. I don't even play video games anymore because I really don't have the time, but I have a huge collection of old stuff that I like on my entertainment system. A bit of a nostalgic comfort from times in my life when I didn't have anything to worry about. I would instantly end a relationship if my SO sold those things off behind my back. Instantly, no discussion. And I hardly even touch them on a monthly basis.\n\nIt's the principle. You did everything absolutely incorrectly, objectively so. You could have HID the set up, been spontaneous and quirky about it, and encouraged him to do something different, with you, after which he can have it back. Perhaps this could have sparked a routine that sees him actually enjoying his time with you more. I don't know, I am not a psychologist.\n\nWhat I do know is the above was a MUCH better option with better potential results than what you did. A much more rational decision. Maybe this is just me personally, but I see what you did as blatant theft, and I HATE thieves. You took something that wasn't yours and sold it. Your intention was to get rid of something that didn't belong to you, wrong no matter how you look at it.", "Think of it this way. How would you feel if he sold your entire wardrobe or cosmetics or whatever it is you are passionate about because he would feel you are way too \"addicted\" to those items?", "YTA. Gaming can be something that helps people to relax and compress from life. He might have lied to you as he feared a negative reaction, which did happen.\n\nSelling his gaming set up is extreme though, especially if he bought it himself.\n\nI get that it must be hard to not to do as much with him as you did before, but that should have been a really stern talk that should have included the consequence: *\"I'm willing to work with you and allow you your gaming time, but it hurts me to see what's happening and if doesn't improve, I see no other choice for me but to end this relationship.\"*\n\nAs harsh as this sounds... He clearly seems to not be interested anymore and even if it might be \"just\" addiction (before anyone says anything, I am an avid gamer myself and an addiction exists) to gaming, it is very clear that at the moment he's not interested in the relationship.\n\nSo I say YTA for the extreme, but also YTA to yourself. This is not healthy for either of you and it might be just that he changed and has different interests now and that you aren't compatible anymore.", "YTA and about to be single", "YTA i can't wait until he phones the police and reports you for theft and recording him without his consent, you had every right to give an ultimatum but selling his property is a different business entirely", "Hubby in this situation sucks, sure, but the truly AH behavior belongs to you, OP.\n\nLet\u2019s see: You immediately assumed he was lying about being sick and can\u2019t fathom that one can be sick and still functional enough to game. So you decide to put surveillance cameras in your house to spy on your husband because you didn\u2019t trust him. That\u2019s a major AH move. (You could have just checked Twitch to see if he was broadcasting, you know\u2026) \n\nBut the final coup-de-grace on being a complete AH is selling HIS property without so much as discussing your concerns. You decided to \u201cfix\u201d the problem by stealing his stuff. \n\nYTA and it\u2019s not even close. You\u2019re the kind of control freak woman that is pushing guys away from wanting ANY relationships.", "YTA.\n\nDid you honestly think this was going to solve the problem? Even if he was addicted to gaming (and it's a thing, I know), this isn't how you handle it. I'm also going to go out on a limb here and say there's more to all of this story.", "YTA and it sounds like you\u2019re getting a divorce so good luck with that. \n\nMy spouse and I both love video games. They play more than me, but we\u2019re adults and communicate. I would never sell anything of theirs. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with communicating how much it bothers you or wanting to find a way to connect again. There\u2019s also definitely times where people can become addicted and need help. But you spied with a camera and then sold someone else\u2019s things without them knowing. \n\nNot cool.", "YTA\nThe way to deal with gaming addiction is a calm,adult conversation. Not selling his belongings", "YTA. That is his property, which you sold.\n\nAlso spying on him is a massive invasion of privacy. \n\nIf you don't like it, leave him.", "YTA. You went about this alllll wrong. It was wrong to hide a camera & spy on him. It was wrong to get rid of his things.\nYour intent wasn't to address a problem in your relationship, or his behavior that having a negative impact. It was done to \"catch\" him and then punish him.\nYou managed to act like a child, and treat him like a child with your behavior.", "YTA\n\nHe is an adult and can spend his time however he wants. You are an adult as well and can divorce him for this.\n\nY TA for selling his stuff.", "Selling his things AND installing spy cams? Big Time YTA. That's not the way to solve the problem. Even if he's an addict, that won't help. In fact, if he's an addict, that's the last thing you wanna do. Get some marriage counseling if you feel you can't have a normal discussion with him.", "YTA.\n\n1. You can play video games when you're sick. It's actually pretty common.\n\n2. You installed a secret camera and violated his privacy to see if he was doing something that is literally broadcast to the world? Why wouldn't you just keep an eye on his Twitch channel to see how much he is streaming.\n\n3. You stole his belongings. Always the asshole.\n\nWhile the described behavior is a problem, none of these are acceptable ways of addressing it.", "Yes, but it sounds like you both ended up working your problems as a result so it's not a total fail", "I am going to go little left field on this one but...\n\nNAH - I don't think you're AH. But I think your  is at its end. You say tried talking to your husband  that did not work. He lied to you about being sick so he can game. I think you want your husband back. \n\nBut I think it might have been a better way to go about this. \n\nYour husband allow to have his hobbies. However, those hobbies should not be at the cost of the relationship. From the information given it sounds more like an addiction. He needs a wake up call.", "So this is a situation where, technically, you both suck. However, the degree to which you suck is so much greater, I have to assume you\u2019re also exaggerating about his \u201caddiction.\u201d\n\nYou spied on him, stole his property, and then kicked him out for retrieving his property. I have to assume you\u2019re also just mad he doesn\u2019t devote 100% of his time to you, because those first three things are not the actions of a reasonable person.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019ll probably get a lot of sympathy here because \u201cyour husband is a *gamer?!* Ew! How immature!\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA Legally you commited a theft ... You could be charged for it if he decides to press charges. What charges can you presses against him ? Not a single charge ... Come on ... You took it way too far way out of the scope of the law.

Sounds like he's flirting with an addiction. \n\nYou suck for spying on him, stealing and selling his property. \n\nESH.", "ESH", "What would you rather he be doing? Can you articulate this? Have you made recommendations of specific activities that involve both of you? Were any of these brought up with any sort of preparatory lead-time? Does he have friends outside of your relationship? If so, are they your friends too? If not, do you allow him to?\n\nStreaming goes beyond gaming itself; it's a parasocial interaction between the streamer and viewers. If it's all he's doing in his free time, he's probably trying to fill in a social hole. Something is missing, and you took away his means to even attempt to satiate that core human desire without offering up your own.

As someone who enjoys video games (and other hobbies) there definitely needs to be a balance if you are also trying to maintain a healthy relationship with your spouse.", "I hope he files a police report against you. You stole from him and then sold it. YTA and don't deserve him. It sounds like he's trying to get his name out there streaming and based on your shitty attitude you knew that and didn't disclose it. Getting your name out to the streaming world is hard work and takes dedication, which he was doing. Enjoy being single.", "Was he going to go on the business trip? He has faults but definitely YTA for the camera, you can play games while sick even though his level of gaming doesn't sound healthy it is not enough to sell his stuff from under him", "ESH husband doesn\u2019t love you enough to build on your relationship and you don\u2019t respect him or yourself enough to walk away.

Then he went a step further and has now put gaming over his job. You say you have talked to him about it as well. \n\nSo, you hit your breaking point and acted accordingly. You had a clear plan and got his attention, much in the way that an intervention does. I appreciate you knew where his stuff was and that he could go back and get it. \n\nIt's not a healthy choice you made, but I'm not sure what healthy choice there is besides just leaving him.

Makes separation a bit simpler, if you don't end up reconciling.", "Im going with YTA- If you went as far as to install a camera in his gaming room to spy on him and then sold his gaming setup, I have no doubt you did other things to drive him away from you.  I think you need to think a lot about what you did to contribute to this problem...\n\nAlso- A lot of people play video games while they are sick...

We got along well, had several common interests, etc. However, our relationship began to take a turn over the last year after he started streaming video games on Twitch. At first it was just a hobby for him, but soon he began to get consumed by streaming. For example, while at first he'd only stream a couple days a week for a few hours at a time, around late November he began spending nearly every minute he wasn't at work streaming (he doesn't stream for money). During this time, we also stopped spending nearly as much time together and our relationship predictably deteriorated. I tried talking to him multiple times about how I felt about how little time he was spending with me and finding alternative hobbies, but they all fell on deaf ears and nothing significant changed. \n\nLast week, my husband told me he was sick and that he needed to take a few days to recover. I asked if he wanted me to stay back from a short business trip I was going on to take care of him, but he told me it wasn't necessary. Something about his tone didn't sit right with me, so on a hunch I installed a small camera in his gaming room that'd allow me to see into it. Sure enough, he'd spent every waking minute while I was gone gaming. When I came back, I was furious with him and decided to take a drastic move to fix his problem. When he went for work the next day, I sold his gaming setup and waited for him to get back. \n\nAfter he got back, he immediately saw that his setup was gone and realized what I did. He started yelling at me for taking away his only hobby, and I responded by calling him an addict who only cared about his streaming, pointing out all the times he'd neglected me in favor of gaming and telling him that I knew he'd blown off work to stream. We argued for a little while more, and then I gave him an ultimatum - I told him where I'd sold his setup and that there was a 48 hour return policy, so he could go get it. However, that would necessitate moving out, as I wouldn't stay with him unless he got help for his habit. Long story short, he got his gaming setup then went to stay with a friend.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What charges can she presses against him ? That he is neglecting her and he is a video-game addict ? Come on ... She took it way too far way out of the scope of the law.

I would rather have sold it, and told him a while after that he could get it back (after a good meaningful talk) and then he\u2019d probably have learned a lesson at that point.

Note how he probably wouldn\u2019t be getting the money from her selling the setup (making an assumption here, correct me if I\u2019m wrong).

But you seem to be implying the \"issues\" are somehow symmetrical or that OP's wife was nuts for wanting proof her husband was lying to her. It's not crazy if you're right. \n\nLike I said, maybe there were more productive ways to handle this, but she'd obviously been trying for a while, and this deception on the part of her husband was the last straw.

They're both AHs.", "How do you know he wasn't actually sick? You don't have to be stuck in bed all day when you're off work sick. If it is the type of sick where you can't leave bed, I (f) usually have my switch and kindle next to the bed incase I want to do something other than sleep it off. I always question if its actually addiction as I see too many women on fb complaining about their other half's gaming habits when in reality its just because they don't have any hobbies other than maybe watching reality TV and they just expect their other half to fill in the gaps around the shows.", ">Well legally she commited a theft ... She could be charged for it if he decides to press charges.\n\nThey're married. That's her gaming system too. No one is getting charged for selling a household item.", "He did call her bluff. She knew he would get it back so who would have kept the money is a moot point. \n\nWhat I'm confused about is how OP didn't realise that this was the nuke button on the marriage, that was the risk she took with the tough love approach. It sped up the end of the relationship. If he was taking sick leave to game while she was away, it was probably only a matter of time until he proposed to resign his job and become a professional streamer.\n\nShe didn't have a lot of choice if she wanted a result. More requests to fall on deaf ears? Counselling? He's not gonna waste gaming time on that.", "Nah, I'm not going to pretend it is justified to take something that is not yours, and the \"well they share everything because they are married\" isn't a real argument, nor is it remotely true, sorry. You shouldn't be encouraging someone to take what doesn't belong to them. No justification for it.", "Right that's what I was thinking. Most computers are easily over 1k. \nIn Canada, theft over 5k is a felony charge. Not your average price of a gaming computer, but not unreasonable to reach that amount either. \n\nSo much risk for no real gain selling his gaming set up.", "I didn't say it was.

Not only do I think they\u2019re serious but I agree. She totally sounds psycho", "Oh I absolutely agree. She is the major AH for selling the system rather than talk to him. I'm just going off the commenters logic that she needs to take a hint. These are grown married adults, there should be zero hints from either of them.", "She tried talking to him but it fell on deaf ears, I think ESH as they both have issues to work on, but I definitely think she should leave and find a better husband, cause this guy sure isn't it.", "And spied on him. Don't forget that episode of prolonged, explosive weirdness.", "Did you miss the part where she tried to talk to him multiple times and it was useless? \nOP is TA for selling his things instead of just leaving, but a desperate measure to try and fix her marriage is better (but not by much) than what he's done", "Imagine if it was other way around and some random dude came to throw away his wifes computer if she did not spend time with him. She clearly is an asshole but redditors have double standards", "At no point was it made clear that he lied to her at all. She disliked that he played videogames when he was home. That says nothing about whether or not he was actually sick. People playing games when they are sick is incredibly normal. Contrary to popular belief, you are not required by law to stare at your ceiling all day when you take ill.\n\nWhen I am sick, I do not stay in my room. I walk the dogs, I cook my meals, and I tend to the chicken coop and any yard work I can get done. The point of calling off when I am sick is not to lay in bed all day. It is to keep others in the office from getting sick. To the majority of us, this is common sense.", "And it had a 48-hour window.....so did not permanently sell it. A lower risk way of sending a message. \n\nI think that if she would have given an ultimatum he would have blown it off since the issue had been brought up before.", "Yeah I must have skipped over the last sentence when I wrote that comment.

I hope that you get through this. It is not an easy thing to go through a separation/ divorce. I encourage you to take some time to reflect on your own actions and behaviors / decision making during these events. Your husband may be the precipitating factor, but there were two people in that relationship. You aren't absolved of your actions because you were right and your (ex?) husband is a lying addict. I don't mean the actions in this post either. Long term neglect in a romantic relationship has long term consequences. I would imagine there is a lot more going on here that you've experienced consciously or subconsciously.

Her behavior was awful and unfair, simply because she was bitter they were breaking up. Her ex only married her as a favor in the first place so she could have insurance. She still wanted half of everything, including a house that she had nothing to do with. She didnt even work the entire 7 years they were married even though her ex tried to get her to get a job since the beginning after she lost her job which is why she needed the insurance as her ran out.", "you\u2019re trying to argue that legality = morality and it doesn\u2019t so yes you\u2019re corny, it might legally be okay but it\u2019s a dick move so yes you\u2019re a cornball, also something being law doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s a good law, i\u2019m not talking about this law i mean in general", "Uh, during a marriage if you're prioritising streaming over your wife then you are TA. If you prioritise streaming over your actual job and pull a sicky just to stream, you are TA. If you ignore all attempts at conversation to discuss the issue, you are TA. If you are no longer doing basic tasks because you are obsessed with streaming, you are TA.\n\nWife is not TA for wanting evidence and no longer putting up with it.", "Counseling should have came well before this. We all have struggles but if it ever gets to the point where your significant other is deciding what's best for you there may not be a point in counseling.", "Considering she sold it out of spite. I'd say they're better off splitting up.", "Doesn\u2019t matter she shouldn\u2019t have sold it as it\u2019s not hers to sell.\n\nThere are other options she could have utilised.", "It did kill her marriage tho /s", "Well maybe not illegal then, but still fucked up", "if you were married to someone who would sell your belongings on a dime and surveils you like a predator to check what you're doing when they're away...wouldn't you want to escape into a fantasy world too?  \n\n\njust sayin'...", "desperate is unplugging everything and taking the plugs away for a night so a productive discussion could be had about gaming and boundaries.  \n\n\nSelling his shit isn't desperate- it's vindictive. Worse when you consider that  what she got for it is likely half it's worth, and then on top of a financial loss she gave him an ultimatum that if he picks it up he cant come home. She kobyashi maru'd him (i know im typing that word wrong)", "Which is mind boggling... she could have just subbed to his twitch stream and seen what he was up to. ;-)", "So we\u2019re just going to ignore the fact that he lied?\n\nYou\u2019re reaching so far to make her the bad guy that you\u2019re about to fall over.", "Well for those of us that don't have unlimited sick days and need mental health days, we pull sickies.", "I think my main points of disagreement is around the degree to which OP's actions were inappropriate. \n\nI'm fundamentally of the opinion that when you're being lied to like this, taking steps to confirm it is not only warranted, but fundamentally reasonable. Much like situations where I think snooping through someone's phone when they've been cheating on you to get proof is ok, so is this. Though I guess I understand that reasonable people can disagree here.\n\nOP taking the console was about making a statement about the seriousness of the situation, and ultimately I think it was acceptable, if not ideal way to handle it.\n\nYour note to OP was very kind.", "When I had covid I sat in my basement for a week straight just playing video games. Was I sick as hell? Yeah. Was I not going to do something I enjoyed that didn't take much energy from me because of it? No. The last time you were sick, did you just sit there and not do anything or did you read or watch tv? I will concede he should have talked to her, but that doesn't excuse OP's actions.  \n\n\nEdited to add a sentence.", "OMG LMAO yes because streaming takes so much out of you \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd23", "Lol. You have one side of the story from a person who by their own admission is dishonest and sneaky.  Please, piss off with \"correcting\" others posts when you know nothing.  As a point in fact you do need to be a psych or addiction specialist in order to diagnose a psych problem.  Your opinion is literally meaningless.", "I'm sorry I missed the part where he was centering his life around a hobby. He called in sick from work. Maybe he was sick. Maybe there is more to the relationship than you or I can tell from a Reddit post. She sounds batshit crazy to spy on him. The sell his things behind his back. She needs therapy.", "No good deed goes unpunished. Definitely should never get married unless you want to. Although I am curious, why say yes to an engagement if you don\u2019t actually want to seal the deal?", "First off he could\u2019ve not felt well that doesn\u2019t really matter. Secondly, not getting enough attention is no excuse to spy on anybody. Any situation like this would make the wife the ahole. She should have just cut her losses not turn psycho", "She sold it because he is an addict and gave him a way to retrieve it easily.", "Which ones? You all say that but don't say which. Reasoning with an addict is absolutely useless - as she already tried.", "Take this how you will. I just wouldn't put my partner in that position to begin with?", "Honestly, that's where I thought this was going to go, but to go buy and then install a hidden cam is 18 layers of crazy at least.", "Lied to his work? How is it her problem or responsibility?\n\nShe's not writing him sick notes or calling the principal on his behalf.", "In what world is gaming and being sick mutually exclusive?", "Just out of curiosity , what do  you do when you are sick ? Because gaming and watching TV are probably the things i do the most when im home sick with nothing else to do ...", "I\u2019ll upvote this comment on the great conversation. A side note- I find it funny both of our original posts are upvoted and our replies are getting down voted. Reddit is a funny place. \n\nAlas I can see how people take the path of snooping to confirm suspicions but in my book if you\u2019ve gotten to that point then arguably you don\u2019t trust the person you\u2019re with enough to stay with them. \n\nTrust is foundational to all relationships not just romantic. If that\u2019s missing, what are you putting your energy into? Especially when it\u2019s not reciprocated. \n\nBut I think AITA and relationship advice type subs show that people will stay in bad relationships until they\u2019re ready to be taken out back and shot (the relationship not the people.)\n\nI\u2019ve been there, learned that lesson the hard way.", "I take naps. A lot of them. When I say I'm intending to recover from sickness, I rest and don't do much aside from rest. I don't sit in a gaming room constantly.\n\nI agree it doesn't excuse OPs actions but the husband is also an A for being an awful spouse lol", "If it doesn't then why is he being a negligent spouse?", "You don't have to be a specialist to call an apple an apple. I grew up in a household where computer based gambling was an addiction and this is EXACTLY how my other parent was treated by the one with the addiction. If you changed it from streaming to an addictive substance, you would call it what it is.\n\nI'm not saying OP isn't an A, I'm saying that the husband is also an A for prioritising streaming over his damn marriage.", "\"At first it was just a hobby for him, but soon he began to get consumed by streaming. For example, while at first he'd only stream a couple days a week for a few hours at a time, around late November he began spending nearly every minute he wasn't at work streaming\"\n\nCentering his life around streaming.\nWouldn't speak to his wife even though she tried many times to communicate with him.\nIf he is spending all this time streaming when he isn't working then he likely isn't doing any housework or cooking.\n\nOP is an A but so is the husband.", "Bet you love it when people sell your stuff without permission. Also if you spent anytime around real addicts you'd know that would only create more issues.", "Why do you think it\u2019s okay to sell someone\u2019s else\u2019s stuff?", "Change the wifi password? Hidden some essential parts until he sat down and talked to her? Selling something that doesn't belong to you is an extreme move and I would be furious - addicted or not. It's an AH thing to do under the premise of \"It's for your own good\".", "Right! this happens by having discussions before it's a zero-sum game. To her credit OP says she had multiple discussions about this but the last straw was when *she FILMED him SECRETLY* to see what he was doing when she wasn't even at home.lets be fair....she should have left before this. She was already done with him before this. Selling his shit was an AH move\n\n(eta) ...TBF it sounds like OP's husband is addicted to gaming- and no one chooses to be addicted to something, it's a gradual slippery slide. So never say never, friend. take that how you will.", "If you\u2019re too sick to work, you\u2019re too sick to spend every waking minute playing video games. \n\nIf he wants to live that lifestyle he shouldn\u2019t have gotten married.", "The same world where you take time off work to recover from being sick but not when you *are* sick", "I've never been sick enough to skip work, but feeling well enough to play videogames, let alone stream to a bunch of strangers. But then, I don't find videogames relaxing in the first place. Like I said, if you ignore all the context and give OP's husband the very best interpretation possible, then I think you can say that this interpretation is not incompatible with the OP's description.\n\nI think OP's husband knew she was going out of town for a couple of days, and saw his chance to indulge his addiction by calling out of work. He knew his wife was already sick of it, so he told her he was \"sick\" which gave him plausible deniability to be home. \n\nSpending nearly all your free time playing videogames when you're married is fundamentally selfish and destructive to the relationship.", "Because his wife says so lol. It's ok to have your own thing.", "If it's an addiction, why is he an AH?  Addiction is a disease.", "It sounds like the OP needs to get a hobby of her own.", "It's not for his own good only. It's for her good, too. What do you think would have happened if she changed the password? Or hid some parts? What do addicts do when you hide some minor stuff they can pay for?", "Lol.\n\nHe wasn't as hardcore into gaming when they got married. \n\nThat's like saying \"you shouldn't have gotten married if you were going to get fat and lazy and spend so much time in Home Depot.\"\n\nI must have missed it, did OP's SO work under you, is that why you're so concerned whether they were too sick to work? It's not a child, this is honestly the silliest comment I have read today. I have to quote it for posterity.\n\n>If you\u2019re too sick to work, you\u2019re too sick to spend every waking minute playing video games. \n\n>If he wants to live that lifestyle he shouldn\u2019t have gotten married.", "Where I come from, if I call in sick then I can do whatever the fuck I want.

That blatantly implies repeated and prolonged use of alcohol to literally every layman ever. \n\nThat's not what an alcoholic is bro. Just stop. \n\nAnd now you're doubling down on your catastrophizing. Literally nothing works like you seem to think it does. Relax.", "It is but that doesn't mean you're not responsible or are exempt from taking accountability for the actions that hurt other people.", "Gonna ignore the whole spy camera part too?", "Nothing worse than what will happen now, that's for sure. People need to stay off each other's property, it's not that hard, I don't know why you're trying to die on this hill.", "It must be really hard for you to understand that there are two people in a marriage. If he only wants to focus on his own needs then he should not be married. \n\nFrom this post though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to have to worry about that much longer.", "See where I\u2019m from if you don\u2019t have a sick day you won\u2019t get paid.
