My bio sister died before I was born from SIDS. My parents went on to have me but mom was left unable to carry more children due to the risk it would pose. They wanted more kids badly, my mom especially. So when I was 7 they started fostering kids and later adopted some of them. In total I now have 5 siblings under the age of 10 and my siblings are my parents priority in everything. \n\nThey show up for their school plays, their talent shows, their extra curricular's, while they miss everything important for me and my dad even said the free curricular's I attend don't really do major games anyway so what's the big deal. And it's their fault I do the free ones because the money was spent on my siblings doing extra curricular's. I don't get to do school field trips anymore because my parents can't always afford for us all to go and I'm the one forced to sacrifice for them. I also had to sacrifice 3 birthdays as well where I got no gift or no party because my parents needed to pay for stuff for my siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThree months ago I broke. Not sure what put me over the edge but I sat my parents down and told them exactly how I feel. I told them I feel like I'm not a priority for them anymore and haven't been in years. I told them I hated them sometimes for it and that there are times I have wished we could go back to them not adopting kids. I told them I felt like I got shafted by them adding to the family and that having siblings didn't make up for everything else. That there are times I feel like my siblings made my life so much worse and that it's not my siblings fault, it's theirs (my parents). I told them it hurt being the only one whose birthday was okay to skip, but the second I got a job and started buying stuff for myself, they bitched when I wouldn't get stuff for my siblings or share with them. When they buy them treats often and get me nothing.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents were open to what I said. They promised me it would not happen again. And they promised me that I could go on my school's international trip this year. It's some pretty significant money (5k) but I can pay some toward it. They told me they'd cover it and even set money aside.\r  \n\r  \nNow my parents have been asked to adopt the bio sister of my brother. My parents told me about it and that they want to do this but it means no trip for me because the money will be needed. They said it's important to keep the siblings together and surely I can let them make it up to me another time. I told them no, because they won't have the time or the money to make it up to me. I told them I now know I'm not their priority if they do this and they won't have my support and I will check out and start planning a life without them. They were upset, my grandparents are pissed and now my parents have said I was unfair to them and to my brother and his bio sister.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692083617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rla63/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_will_plan_for_a/", "score": 397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I feel like I might be TA here is I know this is a huge thing, something unexpected that they could not have seen coming and I basically told them don't adopt or they lose me, and there's nothing they can do to make it up to me. This whole decision impacts our whole family but especially my brother. I can admit I might be selfish and childish here and letting my hurt get in the way of doing the right thing. My parents offered to make up for what they are asking of me and by saying what I did and maybe if I follow through, it's unfair if they are willing to put the extra work in to make things better for me. I also knew when they spoke to me that they were trying to reassure me and I blew off what they said. So I might be an asshole here. I might be a huge asshole even.

And I only bring this up because I'm thinking that their decision to want to provide a home for your brother's bio-sister isn't necessarily suddenly going to cost them 5k.

If we put ourselves for a moment into these other kids' shoes... I cannot imagine what it would be like to be the sister in need of a family, or to be your brother and know that your parents/adoptive sister refused to help your bio sister in order to pay for a vacation - yikes.\n\nOn the other hand, the reality is that your parents are indeed choosing other kids over you because they can't afford it all, and so you're getting a short end of some stick. It's not wrong of you to make clear to them that these choices do have a negative impact on you and that you see and resent it. It is very troubling that it's not just this critical decision, but apparently a pattern of your parents even favoring the adopted kids in going to their events and activities at the expense of yours. So it's understandable if you choose to move pretty quickly into independent adulthood and living your own life, so you can manage your own expectations and budget without getting yanked around by mixed messages and broken promises. The good news is that you're nearly an adult, and in the next decade or two, you'll probably build your own family where \\*you\\* get to choose.

Also, it is not clear to me, if your parents are sending your siblings to these expensive school trips (5k is not insignificant and I cannot imagine they can send multiple children to these kinds of school trips).\nI know you were looking forward to this school trip, however the problem seems to be more the fact that your parents are putting all their attention and focus on the needs of their adopted children, while assuming you will be ok, since you did not go through the turmoil of family breakup and new family.\nOf course they are on the wrong, but honestly, I do not think this school trip is the solution, even if they keep their word and send you to it. The solution you are looking for is equal place in their attention and focus span. You need their time and presence in your life.\nYou are not the AH for wanting that. You have every right to expect them to support you as well. \nHowever, you are the AH ( in my opinion) to make this trip an ultimatum.

Which, is something natural siblings experience. \n\nAdoption is not easy, especially for kids older than baby/toddler ages. Your parents are clearly loving and kindhearted people, or they wouldn\u2019t be asked again. \n\nYou\u2019re old enough to understand this, but still think you\u2019re an only child with special privileges. You\u2019re not. These are your siblings. If your mother were miraculously pregnant, would you feel the same way? \n\nYou might not be an AH, but your attitude isn\u2019t helpful to your own mental health and growth as a decent person. Resent is never a good choice. \n\nLearn to compromise, it will serve you well in adult life when dealing with gray areas. Future bosses won\u2019t/don\u2019t accept employee demands. Shutting them out of your life sounds like a loss of great people. \n\nIf you really can contribute towards something YOU want, go ahead.

My bio sister died before I was born from SIDS. My parents went on to have me but mom was left unable to carry more children due to the risk it would pose. They wanted more kids badly, my mom especially. So when I was 7 they started fostering kids and later adopted some of them. In total I now have 5 siblings under the age of 10 and my siblings are my parents priority in everything. \n\nThey show up for their school plays, their talent shows, their extra curricular's, while they miss everything important for me and my dad even said the free curricular's I attend don't really do major games anyway so what's the big deal. And it's their fault I do the free ones because the money was spent on my siblings doing extra curricular's. I don't get to do school field trips anymore because my parents can't always afford for us all to go and I'm the one forced to sacrifice for them. I also had to sacrifice 3 birthdays as well where I got no gift or no party because my parents needed to pay for stuff for my siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThree months ago I broke. Not sure what put me over the edge but I sat my parents down and told them exactly how I feel. I told them I feel like I'm not a priority for them anymore and haven't been in years. I told them I hated them sometimes for it and that there are times I have wished we could go back to them not adopting kids. I told them I felt like I got shafted by them adding to the family and that having siblings didn't make up for everything else. That there are times I feel like my siblings made my life so much worse and that it's not my siblings fault, it's theirs (my parents). I told them it hurt being the only one whose birthday was okay to skip, but the second I got a job and started buying stuff for myself, they bitched when I wouldn't get stuff for my siblings or share with them. When they buy them treats often and get me nothing.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents were open to what I said. They promised me it would not happen again. And they promised me that I could go on my school's international trip this year. It's some pretty significant money (5k) but I can pay some toward it. They told me they'd cover it and even set money aside.\r  \n\r  \nNow my parents have been asked to adopt the bio sister of my brother. My parents told me about it and that they want to do this but it means no trip for me because the money will be needed. They said it's important to keep the siblings together and surely I can let them make it up to me another time. I told them no, because they won't have the time or the money to make it up to me. I told them I now know I'm not their priority if they do this and they won't have my support and I will check out and start planning a life without them. They were upset, my grandparents are pissed and now my parents have said I was unfair to them and to my brother and his bio sister.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Plan for yourself, save money for yourself and get out of there as soon as you legally can.", "NTA. Like, definitely not the a. You are 16 and this sounds neglecting. Can't get over adults wanting to make you the bad guy for pointing out the neglect. \n\nAlso I have a feeling that there is something psychological going on with your parents. Having the need to \"save\" all that kids and stuff. They're kinda filling a hole with that behavior. And maybe because you are the bio child and they are by law responsible for your well-being that doesn't kick those void-filling behavior. But big assumption here! Don't take it too serious. Maybe worth talking to a professional about. \n\nWhat isn't an assumption is that this family is hurting you emotionally and I strongly advertise you to get out of there. Get yourself help, try to get psychological consulting once you can afford that and build your own future. You are worthy of being loved and seen and cared for. It's hard to accept that you don't get that from your parents but you can't change them you can only change yourself and how you deal with them. Best of luck buddy!", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that your parents have neglected you and continue to do so. They\u2019ve proved time and again that their adoptive kids are their priority.

It looks like your parents choose to have more children that they can afford, and this is detrimental for everyone involved. It is completely irresponsible of them to try to adopt one more at this stage.", "NTA- why do they need to adopt the sibling? My younger siblings are adopted, my brother we got when he was almost 2, wasn\u2019t adopted until 5, 1 sister we got as soon as she was discharged from the hospital & was (finally) adopted at like 13/14, then my other sister we got around 7-8 months old and was adopted at around 2/3. They can be legal guardians without spending anything (in fact, the state usually gives you money & I believe the kids get Medicaid). If they can\u2019t afford to take care of everyone, they shouldn\u2019t have so many kids.

You will find family in the people who care about you.\n\nMost schools have some kind of infrastructure to ensure that students who have limited means can still access activities. Talk to your guidance counsellor about your situation - let them know that you have missed field trips, that you are limited to free extra curriculars,  and what is going on with the international trip. \n\nThe school might have a fundraising option, or some resources for you, and they may be able to waive the fees for the extra-curriculars and field trips.", "NTA.

Best to start focusing on life after you leave home, don\u2019t bother putting any more energy into a family that doesn\u2019t reciprocate. \n\nYour parents sound narcissistic, what is really driving them to continually adopt other children and ignore their biological child?", "NTA not at all", "NTA. I do honestly understand where your parents are coming from with wanting to adopt the bio sibling and my heart also hurts for those siblings who have been separated. But they can\u2019t adopt one child at the expense of another. Had they treated you properly all along then that one broken promise wouldn\u2019t have been such a betrayal.", "NTA, what your parents are doing to you is the same thing that happens in the care homes, the older ones get overlooked, neglected and not listened to, the thing that makes your parents worse is they are doing this to their blood their child, get out as fast as possible and just cut contact cause they will definitely expect you to pay towards these kids when you get a job, good luck", "NTA that fucking sucks. I hope you are saving money to get out of there when you are able to.", "OMG I'm so sorry.. so very sorry this is happening to you .. you're definitely NTA .. for all the good intentions of your parents, they're refusing to see that **good intentions can have bad consequences too**.. \n\nFrom a person who's had a similar conversation with her parents about their own kids not being their priority, let me tell you this YOUR PARENTS WON'T CHANGE. In their minds what they're doing is \"good\" and you sacrificing for that good isn't bad and maybe it will come back to you as karma. They will hear you and make all the promises they can till they actually have to act on their promise. Then they'll double back on it for some more \"greater good\". \n\nGET OUT OF THERE OP. Even if they accept your wishes to not adopt anymore, they'll never love and cherish and treasure you  the way you want to be loved. And from here on they'll only hold it over your head that you denied them the happiness of having two more kids. That's not a position you want to be in. \n\nI don't know how the legal aspects of these things work in your country. Maybe move in with your grandparents or other relatives and your parents can give them child support (your relatives can even adopt you if it's a possibility). Go NC with them and whatever you earn, save it up for your own future, because we already know your parents have 0 interest in your future. Going NC with them is for your own benefit, mentally and emotionally. They will never understand your feeling of being left behind because they are on a high (yes it's addictive) from all the gratefulness, love, and positive comments and appreciation they're getting for the things they're doing for your other siblings. \n\nTalk to other family members to see if they can help loan you the money for your trip. Time apart from your parents will do you definite good. Also talk to your grandparents whether it'll be possible for you to move in with them. Your parents can start bitching about it, even apologizing if you do that. Stand your ground. They just don't want the image of them being bad parents to their only biological child out in public. It's not out of love for you.", "NTA  They obviously can't take care of those they have now. In no way is it ever okay to not get your child something for their birthday so they can spend money on another child.

Just suck it up for the next 2 years and then go no contact.

Starting that process now will be much easier than when you've been trying to find that salvation at the bottom of a bottle at the age of 30.", "Holy shit NTA at all.

It\u2019s a shame you\u2019re figuring out how to be an adult making mature decisions for your own well-being so young, but good for you - you handled this maturely, communicated your feelings and set your expectations.

Your parents my have the best intentions in the world, but they sound like clowns when it comes to the implementation. Why would anyone adopt, and then adopt again, when clearly their one bio child is already a strain on the finances?", "NTA. It's great that your parents want to support so many children but not at cost of neglecting their own biochild. It's not unfair of you to ask to be a priority but it's clear you're not, so I'm afraid your only choice is to make a life for yourself without relying on them for anything. Good luck.", "Damn OP. NTA. Just wanted to say I'm sorry for what you're going through. Your parents should be deeply ashamed and I can only hope they'll realize this in time to repair their relationship with you before it's too late. Much love.", "NTA at all. They aren\u2019t sacrificing for your siblings, YOU are sacrificing for your siblings. It\u2019s like you have a loaf of bread, and your parents take it from you and give a slice to each of your siblings. Great, they are fed. What about you though? Sure they are feeding more kids, but leaving you with the crumbs? Not okay. While the system is dreadful, you shouldn\u2019t save one kid from abuse and condemn another to neglect.

My little siblings get so much more than me, and it\u2019s not that I want them to have less. I love them. I just wish my parents gave me that kind of love too.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how your outlook on life is, but keep your chin above the water kiddo. None of this is your fault.

I\u2019m not trying to talk you into it, but in your situation, it might be something to think about as a possibility. \n\nGood luck to you, and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this and have been treated like this.", "Electricia's and plumbers are always needed. Trade school is an option,  ut these days can be expensive too. Apprentice might be the best way to go.\n\nBest of luck OP.", "Apprenticeships sound like a fantastic life choice. My SO was pressured to do accounting. He hated it. He's now an electrician. He uses his intelligence to keep a hospital running.\nI'm so sorry that your family are outwardly virtuous but actually quite selfish.\nI'd be so proud if you were my kid.\n\nIt's only one or two more years and you will get out of there.  I reckon you'll find your people.\n\nGood luck.", "You should NOT be giving money to your parents since you work. That money is yours, if your parents don\u2019t see you as a priority than you shouldn\u2019t see them as your priority. Save your money and spend it on whatever you want. Save it for your future. Your grandparents are wrong in this situation.", "I'm so sorry there's no family in your corner. \n\nSave the money and don't let them know.", "Dont give your parents a dime.  Save up all your money and get out of there as soon as you can.\n\nDont buy anything else for your siblings either.  Your parents wanted them they can pay for them", "I\u2019m so sorry.", "Is it something you can suggest? Right now, they\u2019re framing it as your trip versus the girl\u2018s safety. Open up other avenues. Reframe the narrative. \n\nOh, and make sure whatever money you earn for yourself is out of their reach.", "Keep saving your money and working hard at school  as that is your way to escape. Once you get into college, work hard and don't look back.\n\nYour parents at total AH for the way they treat you. Adopting children should never be at the expense of biological children. You should all be treated the same. If they can't do that then they shouldn't adopt any more children.  Have you spoken to CS and let them know what is going on.", "You are absolutely right that they need to fight to keep you. That was never in question. You having a hard time trusting them to follow through is also earned here. \n\nI truly do hope for you that they do the work to change. Best of luck to you.", "I literally teared up reading this. No child deserves this. I don't think all the apologies in the world are ever going to be enough for this. \n\nSending you all the hugs, love, appreciation, positive vibes and all things good I possibly could. I hope you do great in life. I hope you meet friends and mentors who can shower you with so much love and treasure you the way you deserve to be treasured.", "I\u2019m not going to pretend to know anything about the conditions around the sister\u2019s situation or the circumstances behind foster vs adoption in this case. What I do know is that there are legal differences between the two and the foster agency works with the parents on behalf of the child\u2019s best interests. It might not be as easy as just foster. IDK. \n\nHowever, if the parents and agency are already discussing adoption, then that means the likelihood of reunification with the biological family is not in the best interests of the sister. \n\nHowever, if fostering before adoption is an option then OP should discuss that with the parents and have them explain to him the reasons and circumstances behind their decisions so that he better understands. That doesn\u2019t mean he has to accept those reasons or be happy about them, but it does make him better informed.", "Valid on the rating upon further reflection. I tried to communicate that the parents are the biggest AH but the rating unnecessarily complicates it. Will edit. Thank you for the perspective.", "They just want to have more children than they can comfortably provide for?  Yeah, that's even worse.", "[deleted]", "My grandparents have told me I have more than they did when they were growing up. They both came from large, poor families so they think I have more than enough. They also think I could help out more financially since I work, instead of selfishly spending it on myself.", "Yes, I poured my heart out to them.", "I'm not sure they even know that it's still an issue. When they started fostering they stopped attending PT conferences for me. They request a note from my teachers which they never read.", "I don't have anyone else I could live with right now. Wish I did.", "I was thinking auto mechanic mostly. I found some apprenticeships online that fit that too. Of course they're available way too early for me but I do want to keep my eyes on them and I'll look elsewhere too.\n\nBeing in the military can be dangerous. That's not something I feel comfortable or confident doing.", "I don't think I'll bother. I think I would get more shit from my grandparents for it. I don't want to make my life more difficult than it already is. Nobody has ever wanted to take from my siblings to make things even.", "Thank you.", "Because his parents thinking: they will always find a reason to cater to everyone but the OP.   \n\nThe parents should be able to say to CPS that they can't afford another adoption at this time and accept the child as a foster (with financial support from the state).   Instead they are yet again denying the OP an opportunity because they prefer their other kids.   And it's not just \"the trip\", it's any and every thing that might require them to support the OP as they do the other kids.", "So sixteen year old you is supposed be financing your parents fantasy of a family they apparently can't afford?   Your parents haven't been able to afford anything but the minimum for you and still find money to pay for extras for your siblings and now you are supposed to pay for more extras *for them*?   \n\nI'm finding it hard to read your responses without out tearing up.  You deserve better parents.   You deserve the kind of parents they are to your adopted siblings.   If they won't do better for you, you should definitely start making plans to leave them when you turn 18.   The really sad thing is that they won't miss you because there won't be any memories of events that include you -- no pictures of your birthdays or games or anything-- because when it comes down to it, they really do not care about you and your feelings.   That's a hard pill to swallow for a child, yet it's something you've known for most of your life.", "Don't give your parents any of your wages. They are supposed to support you until you are 18. If they ask for any money, tell them No, they refuse to find your extracurricular actives, so your wages are for those.", "Your grandparents don't seem to grasp that it's about  how your parents time and money is divided, not about how much time and money they have. They haven't divided the 'resources' equally among the children. You use your income to repair this inequality. There's nothing wrong with that.", "I think you should show them this post to let them see other peoples thoughts as well as yours.\n\nAnd from another internet mom. *You are enough*, I'm sorry that they make you feel that you are not.", "Yes, but *exactly* those words? How they've always made you feel like you weren't enough? How you feel like they would have preferred you weren't born so your mom could have more kids? Etc. It can be easy to focus on enumerating the specifics of all the ways they have made you feel this way over the years without literally saying it, and if you don't literally say it, they'll still view the examples through their lense instead of yours", "Have you shared this with a trusted teacher or school administrator?  Maybe they can help you emancipate or do something more productive.  Meanwhile they can perhaps keep your savings safe from being confiscated.", "??  They show up for your siblings but not for you?   Have they ever indicated that they have given any thought to what you might be doing when you finish high school?\n\nYou really need to start working with a career counselor at school.  You need to have someone in your corner.  That's usually your parents but since that doesn't apply in your case...", "That is awful.  I am so sorry.", "Pretty much. Back in my grandparents day once kids started working the money went to their parents/family, etc. That's the kind of attitude my grandparents have. Maybe my parents even have it I'm not sure. But what I do know is they can go above and beyond for my siblings and not me, in all ways, not just financially.\n\nDeep down I have always felt it but more so since I got pushed way to the side.", "It\u2019s definitely heartbreaking to read", "Yes, I said those things to them.", "They show up for my siblings, sometimes multiple times a year for them. They have never mentioned me finishing high school or my plans.", "Send them the link to this post.   Let them see it in black and white.  They need to read it every day/week until it sinks in.", "As a mom, my heart would absolutely break if my kid said anything even close to this to me. I would spend every minute of my life from that point forward doing everything I could to repair the damage I had done. There's not a snowballs chance in hell it would cross my mind to walk back a promise to them after they said something like this. \n\nThis is 100% your parents' issue. No child deserves to be treated the way you're being treated. I'm so sorry you got such a crappy draw in the parent lottery, you didn't deserve it. You haven't done anything wrong here and emotionally disengaging from them is absolutely the right decision. \n\nIt's clear from your comments that the parentification you've been put through has matured you far beyond what's healthy or reasonable for your age. Nothing will take that back, but you can use the strength it's given you to build an incredible life. Away from them. \n\nYou're NTA and I highly recommend that you read Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay Gibson. Even though you're not quite adult aged yet, it will help you to understand what drives your parents behaviour and hopefully internalise that it isn't anything to do with you or your value. The people in your world are very lucky to have you, it's such a shame your parents don't realise that yet. Take care of yourself, somebody has to and you deserve so much more than they've given you", "Ok. To be clear, you were NTA regardless of what your answer was. I should have led with that. Ok. Time to make plans. Are you thinking university, trade school, or military?", "It's not unusual for people to worry that adopted children may not be treated as well as bio-children.  Your parents are the opposite, they seem to have decided that having birthed you, they did all they needed.\n\nI agree with the other commenter: send them a link to this post so they can read about themselves and appreciate what massive AHs they are to their eldest child.", "I'm thinking apprenticeship."]}
