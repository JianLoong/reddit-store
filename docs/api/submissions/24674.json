My bio sister died before I was born from SIDS. My parents went on to have me but mom was left unable to carry more children due to the risk it would pose. They wanted more kids badly, my mom especially. So when I was 7 they started fostering kids and later adopted some of them. In total I now have 5 siblings under the age of 10 and my siblings are my parents priority in everything. \n\nThey show up for their school plays, their talent shows, their extra curricular's, while they miss everything important for me and my dad even said the free curricular's I attend don't really do major games anyway so what's the big deal. And it's their fault I do the free ones because the money was spent on my siblings doing extra curricular's. I don't get to do school field trips anymore because my parents can't always afford for us all to go and I'm the one forced to sacrifice for them. I also had to sacrifice 3 birthdays as well where I got no gift or no party because my parents needed to pay for stuff for my siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThree months ago I broke. Not sure what put me over the edge but I sat my parents down and told them exactly how I feel. I told them I feel like I'm not a priority for them anymore and haven't been in years. I told them I hated them sometimes for it and that there are times I have wished we could go back to them not adopting kids. I told them I felt like I got shafted by them adding to the family and that having siblings didn't make up for everything else. That there are times I feel like my siblings made my life so much worse and that it's not my siblings fault, it's theirs (my parents). I told them it hurt being the only one whose birthday was okay to skip, but the second I got a job and started buying stuff for myself, they bitched when I wouldn't get stuff for my siblings or share with them. When they buy them treats often and get me nothing.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents were open to what I said. They promised me it would not happen again. And they promised me that I could go on my school's international trip this year. It's some pretty significant money (5k) but I can pay some toward it. They told me they'd cover it and even set money aside.\r  \n\r  \nNow my parents have been asked to adopt the bio sister of my brother. My parents told me about it and that they want to do this but it means no trip for me because the money will be needed. They said it's important to keep the siblings together and surely I can let them make it up to me another time. I told them no, because they won't have the time or the money to make it up to me. I told them I now know I'm not their priority if they do this and they won't have my support and I will check out and start planning a life without them. They were upset, my grandparents are pissed and now my parents have said I was unfair to them and to my brother and his bio sister.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692083617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rla63/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_will_plan_for_a/", "score": 2226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I feel like I might be TA here is I know this is a huge thing, something unexpected that they could not have seen coming and I basically told them don't adopt or they lose me, and there's nothing they can do to make it up to me. This whole decision impacts our whole family but especially my brother. I can admit I might be selfish and childish here and letting my hurt get in the way of doing the right thing. My parents offered to make up for what they are asking of me and by saying what I did and maybe if I follow through, it's unfair if they are willing to put the extra work in to make things better for me. I also knew when they spoke to me that they were trying to reassure me and I blew off what they said. So I might be an asshole here. I might be a huge asshole even.

And I only bring this up because I'm thinking that their decision to want to provide a home for your brother's bio-sister isn't necessarily suddenly going to cost them 5k.

That\u2019s quite a near term perspective. \nYou are harboring years worth of earned resentment.

Also, it is not clear to me, if your parents are sending your siblings to these expensive school trips (5k is not insignificant and I cannot imagine they can send multiple children to these kinds of school trips).\nI know you were looking forward to this school trip, however the problem seems to be more the fact that your parents are putting all their attention and focus on the needs of their adopted children, while assuming you will be ok, since you did not go through the turmoil of family breakup and new family.\nOf course they are on the wrong, but honestly, I do not think this school trip is the solution, even if they keep their word and send you to it. The solution you are looking for is equal place in their attention and focus span. You need their time and presence in your life.\nYou are not the AH for wanting that. You have every right to expect them to support you as well. \nHowever, you are the AH ( in my opinion) to make this trip an ultimatum. It is a shiny trophy that not only will not deliver the sense of inclusion and attention that you seek, but will drive a wedge between you, your parents and your sibling.\nStand your ground on being treated equal.

You don\u2019t share their (probable) traumatic stories, instead you complain of missing out.

Your parents are clearly loving and kindhearted people, or they wouldn\u2019t be asked again. \n\nYou\u2019re old enough to understand this, but still think you\u2019re an only child with special privileges. You\u2019re not. These are your siblings. If your mother were miraculously pregnant, would you feel the same way? \n\nYou might not be an AH, but your attitude isn\u2019t helpful to your own mental health and growth as a decent person. Resent is never a good choice. \n\nLearn to compromise, it will serve you well in adult life when dealing with gray areas. Future bosses won\u2019t/don\u2019t accept employee demands. Shutting them out of your life sounds like a loss of great people. \n\nIf you really can contribute towards something YOU want, go ahead. At 16 you\u2019re old enough to earn more money for this very pricey $5,000 school adventure. It\u2019s a great lesson in self-sufficiency.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My bio sister died before I was born from SIDS. My parents went on to have me but mom was left unable to carry more children due to the risk it would pose. They wanted more kids badly, my mom especially. So when I was 7 they started fostering kids and later adopted some of them. In total I now have 5 siblings under the age of 10 and my siblings are my parents priority in everything. \n\nThey show up for their school plays, their talent shows, their extra curricular's, while they miss everything important for me and my dad even said the free curricular's I attend don't really do major games anyway so what's the big deal. And it's their fault I do the free ones because the money was spent on my siblings doing extra curricular's. I don't get to do school field trips anymore because my parents can't always afford for us all to go and I'm the one forced to sacrifice for them. I also had to sacrifice 3 birthdays as well where I got no gift or no party because my parents needed to pay for stuff for my siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThree months ago I broke. Not sure what put me over the edge but I sat my parents down and told them exactly how I feel. I told them I feel like I'm not a priority for them anymore and haven't been in years. I told them I hated them sometimes for it and that there are times I have wished we could go back to them not adopting kids. I told them I felt like I got shafted by them adding to the family and that having siblings didn't make up for everything else. That there are times I feel like my siblings made my life so much worse and that it's not my siblings fault, it's theirs (my parents). I told them it hurt being the only one whose birthday was okay to skip, but the second I got a job and started buying stuff for myself, they bitched when I wouldn't get stuff for my siblings or share with them. When they buy them treats often and get me nothing.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents were open to what I said. They promised me it would not happen again. And they promised me that I could go on my school's international trip this year. It's some pretty significant money (5k) but I can pay some toward it. They told me they'd cover it and even set money aside.\r  \n\r  \nNow my parents have been asked to adopt the bio sister of my brother. My parents told me about it and that they want to do this but it means no trip for me because the money will be needed. They said it's important to keep the siblings together and surely I can let them make it up to me another time. I told them no, because they won't have the time or the money to make it up to me. I told them I now know I'm not their priority if they do this and they won't have my support and I will check out and start planning a life without them. They were upset, my grandparents are pissed and now my parents have said I was unfair to them and to my brother and his bio sister.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA - Sounds like your parents have checked out years ago on you and have had a life lived and planned without you. Plan for yourself, save money for yourself and get out of there as soon as you legally can.", "NTA. Like, definitely not the a. You are 16 and this sounds neglecting. Can't get over adults wanting to make you the bad guy for pointing out the neglect. \n\nAlso I have a feeling that there is something psychological going on with your parents. Having the need to \"save\" all that kids and stuff. They're kinda filling a hole with that behavior. And maybe because you are the bio child and they are by law responsible for your well-being that doesn't kick those void-filling behavior. But big assumption here! Don't take it too serious. Maybe worth talking to a professional about. \n\nWhat isn't an assumption is that this family is hurting you emotionally and I strongly advertise you to get out of there. Get yourself help, try to get psychological consulting once you can afford that and build your own future. You are worthy of being loved and seen and cared for. It's hard to accept that you don't get that from your parents but you can't change them you can only change yourself and how you deal with them. Best of luck buddy!", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that your parents have neglected you and continue to do so. They\u2019ve proved time and again that their adoptive kids are their priority. Not sure how they don\u2019t understand that repeatedly putting you to the very bottom of the priority list means that you acknowledge that and move on without them. Sending you mama hugs.", "I hope they know that once you turn 18 you are gone from their lives . They will have shocked pikachu faces when you don\u2019t want anything to do with them too! But make no mistake once you are old enough to earn they will expect you to help with the costs of the other kids so really set your boundaries as an adult once you hit 18 and stick to them.", "NTA. It looks like your parents choose to have more children that they can afford, and this is detrimental for everyone involved. It is completely irresponsible of them to try to adopt one more at this stage.", "NTA- why do they need to adopt the sibling? My younger siblings are adopted, my brother we got when he was almost 2, wasn\u2019t adopted until 5, 1 sister we got as soon as she was discharged from the hospital & was (finally) adopted at like 13/14, then my other sister we got around 7-8 months old and was adopted at around 2/3. They can be legal guardians without spending anything (in fact, the state usually gives you money & I believe the kids get Medicaid). If they can\u2019t afford to take care of everyone, they shouldn\u2019t have so many kids. If they can\u2019t care for you all equally they shouldn\u2019t have so many kids.", "Try asked by school if funds available to help you . You could get a job and pay back school . Can you stay with grandparents or a friend ?", "I understand how you feel and hope things work out for you, you're definitely NTA, and I think you should stick to your guns. Parents like them need to learn that you're precious and maybe your absence will teach them. Good luck.", "NTA", "NTA and it's awful your parents can't understand the impact their actions are having on you.\n\nI think, unfortunately, this is a case of save your money, do not give your parents any of the account details, and get out as soon as you can.  You clearly can't rely on them.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. You deserve better. As someone who grew up not being prioritized by her parents, I will say it does get better. You will find family in the people who care about you.\n\nMost schools have some kind of infrastructure to ensure that students who have limited means can still access activities. Talk to your guidance counsellor about your situation - let them know that you have missed field trips, that you are limited to free extra curriculars,  and what is going on with the international trip. \n\nThe school might have a fundraising option, or some resources for you, and they may be able to waive the fees for the extra-curriculars and field trips.", "NTA. You\u2019ve said your piece and your parents have listened. They are going to do whatever they want and there\u2019s nothing further you can do that\u2019s productive.\n\nAs shitty as it is I think you have the right idea, it\u2019s not worth continuing to feel let down and disappointment at their behaviour. Best to start focusing on life after you leave home, don\u2019t bother putting any more energy into a family that doesn\u2019t reciprocate. \n\nYour parents sound narcissistic, what is really driving them to continually adopt other children and ignore their biological child?", "NTA not at all", "NTA. I do honestly understand where your parents are coming from with wanting to adopt the bio sibling and my heart also hurts for those siblings who have been separated. But they can\u2019t adopt one child at the expense of another. Had they treated you properly all along then that one broken promise wouldn\u2019t have been such a betrayal.", "NTA, what your parents are doing to you is the same thing that happens in the care homes, the older ones get overlooked, neglected and not listened to, the thing that makes your parents worse is they are doing this to their blood their child, get out as fast as possible and just cut contact cause they will definitely expect you to pay towards these kids when you get a job, good luck", "NTA that fucking sucks. I hope you are saving money to get out of there when you are able to.", "OMG I'm so sorry.. so very sorry this is happening to you .. you're definitely NTA .. for all the good intentions of your parents, they're refusing to see that **good intentions can have bad consequences too**.. \n\nFrom a person who's had a similar conversation with her parents about their own kids not being their priority, let me tell you this YOUR PARENTS WON'T CHANGE. In their minds what they're doing is \"good\" and you sacrificing for that good isn't bad and maybe it will come back to you as karma. They will hear you and make all the promises they can till they actually have to act on their promise. Then they'll double back on it for some more \"greater good\". \n\nGET OUT OF THERE OP. Even if they accept your wishes to not adopt anymore, they'll never love and cherish and treasure you  the way you want to be loved. And from here on they'll only hold it over your head that you denied them the happiness of having two more kids. That's not a position you want to be in. \n\nI don't know how the legal aspects of these things work in your country. Maybe move in with your grandparents or other relatives and your parents can give them child support (your relatives can even adopt you if it's a possibility). Go NC with them and whatever you earn, save it up for your own future, because we already know your parents have 0 interest in your future. Going NC with them is for your own benefit, mentally and emotionally. They will never understand your feeling of being left behind because they are on a high (yes it's addictive) from all the gratefulness, love, and positive comments and appreciation they're getting for the things they're doing for your other siblings. \n\nTalk to other family members to see if they can help loan you the money for your trip. Time apart from your parents will do you definite good. Also talk to your grandparents whether it'll be possible for you to move in with them. Your parents can start bitching about it, even apologizing if you do that. Stand your ground. They just don't want the image of them being bad parents to their only biological child out in public. It's not out of love for you.", "NTA  They obviously can't take care of those they have now. In no way is it ever okay to not get your child something for their birthday so they can spend money on another child. People probably say they're doing such a great thing you should ask whoever does, \"What is so great about adopting other people's kids then letting your bio child know that you mean nothing to them.\" I hope your parents see this post so they can know how little people think of them.", "Why adopt that many children?", "NTA\n\nYou're not gonna change your parents. Just suck it up for the next 2 years and then go no contact. You'll go off to college and meet your people and you can form a family of your choosing to replace the one you never got. \n\nPerhaps start saving for therapy and/or find out how you can go about starting now. It sounds like you have a lot of trauma to work your way through. Starting that process now will be much easier than when you've been trying to find that salvation at the bottom of a bottle at the age of 30.", "Holy shit NTA at all. I was ready to go the other way based on the title but omg. You poor thing. I'm sorry you're going through this and I really hope you're able to heal. You poor sweetheart, I'm so so sorry.", "NTA. I'm sorry this is happening to you. Stay firm and prepare for a life without them.", "What the fuck is wrong with your parents that they prioritise their adopted children over you?! I'm both sad and angry for you because you deserve a hell of a lot more than they are giving. \n\nAbsolutely NTA! You planning your life without them is just carrying on what they've been doing anyway, which is fuck all for you.", "NTA I'm so sorry for your troubles. It sounds awful to be in. 100% do what's best for you. You are worthy of being prioritised and should be. May you find people who are better for you.", "NTA. It\u2019s a shame you\u2019re figuring out how to be an adult making mature decisions for your own well-being so young, but good for you - you handled this maturely, communicated your feelings and set your expectations. They have failed to live up to them. They have let you down.\n\nYou\u2019ll do great. You are more than enough.", "NTA\n\nYou sound so reasonable and mature, but god you must be screaming inside at all the unfairness.\n\nI think you have gone above and beyond in trying to make your parents understand the dynamics and how it makes you feel, and honestly...with this new adoption happening, it must feel like a real stab in the eye for you. \n\nYou have every right to step away from the table and start making yourself a priority, and I wish you all the love and success in doing so :) x", "NTA. That\u2019s neglect.\n\nHave a hug from your internet sibling who\u2019s old enough to understand.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s not fair that you are the one who has to miss out on everything, honestly it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if In your parents minds you aren\u2019t even their child anymore, just someone living in the house. It\u2019s sad to say but they aren\u2019t treating you like part of the family and while 5 kids under 10 is a lot of work it doesn\u2019t mean you should suffer from their choices.\n\nYou approached it with maturity and your response to them talking about adopting again was 100% warranted. As for grandparents, screw them honestly. If they weren\u2019t willing to help you with things like birthdays or occasional treats in the past, they don\u2019t get an opinion on your response.\n\nGood luck in life OP!!! I hope once your out of that house you get to do anything you want", "NTA. Do what you got to do.", "NTA calling them your parents is giving them too much credit imo.", "You need a gofundme. We would all donate. NTA. I have a son your age, and I can not imagine him feeling this way. Leave asap.", "NTA you have been shafted by your parents, and you have been remarkably mature about how you dealt with the situation too, anyone angry at you for stating the truth can sling their hook.", "NTA \n\nIf you do nothing else then please, on this, stand your ground.\n\nThis is a moment in time that you'll look back on and realise just how pivotal it really was so please be strong", "NTA. Your parents my have the best intentions in the world, but they sound like clowns when it comes to the implementation. Why would anyone adopt, and then adopt again, when clearly their one bio child is already a strain on the finances?", "NTA. It's great that your parents want to support so many children but not at cost of neglecting their own biochild. It's not unfair of you to ask to be a priority but it's clear you're not, so I'm afraid your only choice is to make a life for yourself without relying on them for anything. Good luck.", "Damn OP. NTA. Just wanted to say I'm sorry for what you're going through. Your parents should be deeply ashamed and I can only hope they'll realize this in time to repair their relationship with you before it's too late. Much love.", "NTA at all. They aren\u2019t sacrificing for your siblings, YOU are sacrificing for your siblings. It\u2019s like you have a loaf of bread, and your parents take it from you and give a slice to each of your siblings. Great, they are fed. What about you though? Sure they are feeding more kids, but leaving you with the crumbs? Not okay. While the system is dreadful, you shouldn\u2019t save one kid from abuse and condemn another to neglect. It\u2019s a sad reality, but you can\u2019t save everyone. The best thing anyone can do in this world is do good where you can and hold your loved ones closely. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your parents failed you. I\u2019m sorry your grandparents won\u2019t help. And I\u2019m especially sorry about some of the assholes in this thread saying that you are condemning a child to a terrible life just because you want something for yourself for once. I get it. My little siblings get so much more than me, and it\u2019s not that I want them to have less. I love them. I just wish my parents gave me that kind of love too.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how your outlook on life is, but keep your chin above the water kiddo. None of this is your fault. Keep working hard, and go easy on yourself. Not sure if this is allowed on Reddit, but if you happened to start a GoFundMe or something for your trip, I would love to contribute.\n\nVirtual hugs from an older sister :)", "NTA, you have responded so maturely and calmly to not only the comments here but to the situation as a whole when you had the right to react badly. It\u2019s bit fair for your parents to ask you to sacrifice everything but give you nothing in return. \n\nWhen you can go no contact. You deserve a chance to finally find people who care about you. Trust me, found family can be some of the most healing things in the world. Here\u2019s a hug from an internet older sibling if you need one, and my DMs are open if you need someone to vent to.", "NTA. I think what you have said is entirely reasonable given the circumstances. Start planning to go to university in another place, or to take steps to become a well-paid tradie (plumber, electrician etc) so that you can get the life you deserve. I hope that when you are older you will have a partner who loves you unconditionally, lavishly and obviously.\n\nIn the meantime, you'll have to deal with your flakey parents. I think that you have to keep reiterating that you are their son, you expect to be treated fairly, and that broken promises in favour of your mother's baby resettlement scheme are having a disastrous effect on your relationship with her (and your father). Tell her that you think she needs to get an appointment for professional psychological help to deal with the death of your sister, rather than yet another appointment with an adoption agency.\n\nI wish you all the best in the world.", "NTA absolutely. I'm sorry for you. And I'm even more sorry for telling you that adults don't change. Not for other people at least. I wish you the best of luck and to soon find the chosen family you deserve.", "NTA. You deserve better than your parents. Get independent as soon as you can.", "NTA. Your parents need to give their own heads a wobble.", "This is harsh but not meant to be unkind. Right now, I would save everything and leave with no forwarding address when the time is right. You'll have the rest of your life to go places you like with people you love.", "NTA\n\nI hope your grandparents are upset with them and not with you.  If that\u2019s the case can you move in with your grandparents and just not deal with them? You\u2019re 16 and employed and doing decently in school or you wouldn\u2019t be eligible for such trips.

If I were you, I would contact some sort of authority in this matter. Maybe CPS, because it sounds like you're being neglected and chances are, the others are too. Either way, my heart goes out to you. I can't imagine what it's like to have to go years without even getting anything for your birthday of Christmas, or anything at any other holiday.\n\nThis behavior of theirs is the furthest thing from normal, and it needs to be brought to heel. They might seem like noble people but in reality they're just being incredibly selfish and dare I say cruel towards you, their only bio kid.

You sound like a very mature and intelligent young man. \n\nYour parents are completely blinded by doing right by the foster and adopted kids, they don't see they have lost you in the process. I wonder if it's an unresolved grief / trauma response from your sister's death .... Either way, their fault, not yours. \n\nEach ' just once ' hurts. Each ' just be the bigger person ' cuts like a knife. You want to scream, when is my turn, when is my just once. When will I matter. When will someone say, just once, actually, this thing for you is really important, my thing can wait. Just once. The bar is so, so low, because you know even the little you wish for will never come. It's heartbreaking and I'm so sorry. \n\nYou told them clearly how you felt, how their behaviour affected you.

They are a \"danger\" to your mental health and emotional safety, you need to start choosing you over them, because they won't. Start saving up so you can move out when you turn 18, and prepare yourself mentally and emotionally for having to go No Contact (NC) once you do. The only way you will be able to grow and move forward is by protecting and taking care of yourself.

I not only stopped trying to get interested in extracurriculars, I dropped out of high school altogether when I was 16 because I figured nobody would give a fuck and I was right. 15 years ago, I cut my mom out of my life entirely and I don't think I've said 20 words to her since. So when I say I know what you're going through, I want you to know that I really, *really* do.\n\nThat being said, the reason I don't think your parents are assholes here is because I also know how bad the foster system is. I don't think they even reached out to take that kid in; I think what happened is that someone saw who that boy's sister was and thought, \"Well, shit, this family's already adopted 5 kids - maybe see if they'll do one more?\" And I don't blame your parents for considering it, because it's vitally important for kids to have a stable home life. Imagine how that boy's gonna feel if this huge, loving family takes his sister and not him. That's life-altering stuff right there, even if there are other factors to consider that a kid wouldn't be thinking of. All they're going to think is \"No one wants me.\"\n\nSo, ultimately, I kinda think this is just a *catastrophically* shitty coincidence that that kid came up for adoption at this particular moment. If it was me, I'd probably let this one slide and then just watch your parents like a hawk for a while to see if they were actually serious about doing better by you or if they really did just say whatever it took to shut you up like you're thinking. Because it's very likely you're right. But if you decide that this is still an irreparable breach of their word, I wouldn't judge you badly at all. Actions & words have consequences, and your parents have been rolling the FAFO dice for far too long.

Find every excuse for this and lie about expenses if you need to, don't tell them how much you actually make. Learn the legal minimum in your case, and if they ask, that's what you make. Put every as much money aside as you can & make sure they don't have access to it or even info about it.\n\nBetter yet, have a quick escape plan. Make sure that your documents are in order and in your possession. Make sure to have a backpack hidden from them and readily packed in case for the apocalipse.

If your parents are already struggling now, even with you contributing your income, it's only going to get worse when you leave and the siblings get older.\n\nAlso, the best thing you can do for your siblings is lead by example.  Allowing yourself to be subjected to abuse (financial abuse, parentification abuse) increases the chance that your siblings will allow themselves to be subjected to abuse by a parent or partner.

He's internalized all the neglect for so long, he literally broke down."]}
