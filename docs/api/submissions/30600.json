It's odd that your mom thinks  you should weigh in.  Plus, your sister is wrong.  Those dogs go through a TON of training and are awarded military honors if they die in combat.

You're not obligated to respond in any way when people unilaterally decide to dump their personal business in your lap. You didn't ask. It sounds like you don't even agree with her, so even if you did respond, she still probably would have been mad. She just wants validation.\n\nAs for your sister, she's talking out of her ass. Is she a veteran? Because that would surprise me. Does she have any idea the respect veterans have for bomb dogs? These dogs literally get ranks and titles. Their handlers treat them as part of their military unit. They do an important job, and we essentially force them to do that job. A lot of them even get  PTSD from doing it\u2014my friend's dog can't even be around loud noises without freaking out.\n\nSo what if they don't have the brain capacity to understand the sociopolitical factors underlying global conflict\u2014they're dogs. How does that exempt them from respect for putting themselves at risk on our behalf?\n\nI'm a veteran, and you can tell your sister that she's the one disrespecting vets by associating them with her jacked up opinions.", "NTA.

Also: anyone in their late 20's looking for relationship or life advice from a 15 year old needs to really rethink things (no offense intended to 15 year olds, just as a practical matter they lack the life experience here).", "INFO - is your sister 27 still living at home?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I assume the boyfriend is not a veteran (in which case the sister is way out of line), so I'm wondering if the sister is feeling that it's a bit like 'stolen valor' if he's constantly talking about his military dog and she's just expressing it poorly.\n\nIn any case, I don't know why any 27 year old would want a 15 year old's input on their relationship (although it seems that it was more the mum who was annoyed).", "I agree.
