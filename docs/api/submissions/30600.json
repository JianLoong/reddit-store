It's odd that your mom thinks  you should weigh in.  Plus, your sister is wrong.  Those dogs go through a TON of training and are awarded military honors if they die in combat.  Not all of them make the cut.  \n\nI dare your sister to find one veteran who doesn't think a military dog is just a big as part of the team as a human.", "You, kid, are going places. \n\nSeriously.

You're not obligated to respond in any way when people unilaterally decide to dump their personal business in your lap. You didn't ask. It sounds like you don't even agree with her, so even if you did respond, she still probably would have been mad. She just wants validation.\n\nAs for your sister, she's talking out of her ass. Is she a veteran? Because that would surprise me. Does she have any idea the respect veterans have for bomb dogs? These dogs literally get ranks and titles. Their handlers treat them as part of their military unit. They do an important job, and we essentially force them to do that job. A lot of them even get  PTSD from doing it\u2014my friend's dog can't even be around loud noises without freaking out.\n\nSo what if they don't have the brain capacity to understand the sociopolitical factors underlying global conflict\u2014they're dogs. How does that exempt them from respect for putting themselves at risk on our behalf?\n\nI'm a veteran, and you can tell your sister that she's the one disrespecting vets by associating them with her jacked up opinions.", "NTA. This had nothing to do with you and you were right not to interfere.

Why do you, a 15 year old, need to help your adult sister with her BF situation? I mean, she's the one that was kind of an AH to him, she should be the one to work it out.", "NTA.

You shouldn't be pressured into saying something supportive that you don't mean.  Or into offering an opinion on an issue where you don't have anything to add (or don't feel that what you have to add would be worth the headache it would give you, I'm inferring).  Also: anyone in their late 20's looking for relationship or life advice from a 15 year old needs to really rethink things (no offense intended to 15 year olds, just as a practical matter they lack the life experience here).", "INFO - is your sister 27 still living at home?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For me, I\u2019d be better off  to sit silent than tell a sister what I really thought about her disparagement of that dog\u2019s contribution to the military.

You also mixed your sisters and your ages. \n\nShe should not be dating adults.", "I think the sister might be more getting at the fact that the dogs don't choose to sign up and don't really understand what danger they're in. But it is a weird thing to get in an argument about (and I agree that there are few, if any, veterans who would be offended). I assume the boyfriend is not a veteran (in which case the sister is way out of line), so I'm wondering if the sister is feeling that it's a bit like 'stolen valor' if he's constantly talking about his military dog and she's just expressing it poorly.\n\nIn any case, I don't know why any 27 year old would want a 15 year old's input on their relationship (although it seems that it was more the mum who was annoyed).", "I agree.
