No one just sees a pregnant married woman and pulls what he said out of thin air.", "Does your husband want a second child?\n\n\nYou write over and over again about how he's a great dad and loves your current kid....but mention that your current kid was unplanned and make absolutely no mention of if this kid was.", "I'd assume the BIL is having conversations with his brother that you aren't privy to. Best guess is your husband told him he doesn't want more kids and feels like this is being forced onto him loke the first kid was.

Yes, he may have overstepped, but I'm much more concerned that he was genuinely trying to help. I'm worried that your husband's brother is saying all of this because your husband has made it clear to him that he does not want to have another child with you.\n\nPlus your comments about your first pregnancy make it clear your husband ONLY agreed to having the first child because you wanted to keep the baby. And, in all honesty, I get the impression you're so wrapped up in excitement about the pregnancy that you want that you're not even thinking about what your husband wants. If he was so anti-kids, baffled as to why there were no serious measures to prevent another accidental pregnancy.\n\nYou need to have an honest discussion with your husband because there's a much bigger issue here.\n\nETA: Just saw the responses from OP about her husband knowing she was no longer on birth control, and neither of them were using any protection. This definitely changes things, I won't even pretend to understand what is happening at this point.

He will love the kids of course but it won't be enough. If you stay married until the last kid graduates HS he will leave. He will be bitter and resentful of the choices you made for him. Whether it really was 2 unplanned pregnancies or not he will always wonder.

My guess is that BIL is repeating your husband's words and although you say he's a wonderful father, maybe he does feel like he was forced into fatherhood and has complained to BIL about it. \n\nSince husband presumably knows where babies come from, he should have taken steps to prevent baby #2 if it is not 100% wanted and/or you two as parents are not capable of providing everything that these children need. If husband was really on board for baby #2, then he should have handled things immediately with BIL and stood up for you.", "INFO: were you and your husband trying to get pregnant?", "NTA, though I think your husband sent his brother as a proxy.

It was not BIL\u2019s job to discuss this with you if your husband has concerns, and you are not the asshole for refusing to discuss it with him.

Did you both want it? Did you want it and he didn't? Did he want it and you not? Was it a accident, or planned?\n\nYour BIL is a AH, true.

In my opinion OP is TA (and so is her husband) for staying in a relationship with and continuing to sleep with someone that they had an absolutely fundamental incompatibility with. As soon as it was known she 100% wanted kids and he didn\u2019t, they should\u2019ve gone their separate ways. As someone who 100% does not want kids, that\u2019s the type of dealbreaker you screen for either before even going on a date with someone (I make it very clear on dating profiles that I am only seeking to date childfree people who do not want kids) or on the first date to avoid wasting your time. People who don\u2019t want kids shouldn\u2019t have kids. It doesn\u2019t matter that now that the kid born he loves the kid, plenty of people regret kids that they love and are unhappy as parents, and now the fact that OP is having a second child with someone who *never wanted kids* is just idiotic and will have harmful effects whether OP sees them now or not.\n\nThe BIL is not TA, he seems to be the only one looking at this remotely reasonably, and definitely seems to be going off of what he\u2019s heard from OP\u2019s husband, why else would he be saying these things if he thought or knew OP\u2019s husband was happy with having a kid and/or continuing to have kids? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s already brought dissatisfaction to OP\u2019s husband\u2019s life that has been expressed to the BIL and that is what BIL\u2019s statements were based on. Like I said, tons and tons of people regret kids they love and are unhappy being parents even if they love their kids. Having kids for someone else\u2019s happiness is just the worst decision to ever make, along with continuing to date and sleep with someone who wants kids when you don\u2019t, but OP decides to ignore that and then scapegoat the BIL for being based in reality, for that both OP and her husband are TA to me.", "I knew a woman that baby trapped her husband twice.

Those two are also two separate things. \n\nI think the ESH started when a child free person and  a non child free person knowingly decided to get married. They knew that one of them would actively not have the life and future they wanted...and decided it was fine to impose parenthood or childlessness unto a loved one who would not have made that choice. Had you been the child wanting man and had he been a childfree woman, a baby would have never happened. How would you feel then? Would you feel like childlessness was imposed unto you?

Ask him how he truly feels about your 2nd pregnancy, does he regret not using protection, when you came off the pill did he think about how there is now a possibility of pregnancy happening? If he is happy to answer, then I think it's also important to ask husband if he's been confiding in BIL.

Things like that absolutely need to be discussed, to make sure there isn't any resentment or hidden feelings that could build and build inside your hubby and end up badly. In general it's important to pre discuss and plan how many kids/when, especially so here.

He is still has some responsibility on him to protect himself and if he chooses not to he has to accept pregnancy is possible. But he is a grown man.

Your husband loves you enough that he was willing to sacrifice his happiness at the time so you would be happy and you even admit that in your post.

So yeah you should have informed your husband about it instead of immediately causing a scene because now you are scene in a negative light.\n\nBUT! He is also in the wrong from bring that up when frankly its none of his business. He probably felt like his actions were justified because of conversations he had with his brother before your first kid was born and he remembers how his brother felt at the time.

He needs to talk to his brother. He probably things he was trying to help but all he did was instigate a problem.\n\nSo while I dont think you overreacted because what he did was very rude, I do think he made good points and he should talk to your husband about the pregnancy and make sure its the best thing for the both of you.

He\u2019s an idiot if he didn\u2019t foresee this outcome.", "Its both their responsibility and they both failed in their relationship and in making the choice which will likely produce the base case scenario for this up and coming child.", "But it isn't some trap to lay out to gain a child and if you step in it too bad\n\nHaving a child is about the child. The child should have loving parents who desires it above all else.\n\nIt didn't ask for a mother than didn't care about his father, or an irresponsible father that didn't want him. This is what the child gets with this dumb 'you snooze, you lose' mentality about children entering this world.", "I don\u2019t think that sabotaging BC is common, you\u2019re right about that, that\u2019s a misogynistic trope that needs to die. That said, being flippant or irresponsible because \u201che\u2019ll love the baby once we have it,\u201d or \u201cwell I\u2019m fine with an unplanned pregnancy so it\u2019s not a big deal if it happens,\u201d is common. The price is much higher for having kids for women (bodily, financially and life impact), so it\u2019s understandable where this mindset comes from, but it\u2019s still wrong. No one should ever be able to tell a woman what to do with her body or her pregnancy and I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that. \n\nHowever, BC works over 99% of the time when it is used properly, that does not fit with the number of people who claim \u201cBC failure\u201d when their partner did not want a pregnancy. In this case, husband wants no kids, wife wants kids, I guess it\u2019s really convenient they had one and now may have another. Husband gets his share of the blame, they should\u2019ve been divorced or never married and he should\u2019ve gotten snipped, but his entire life is forever devoted to what OP wanted. There is no denying that and no way around it. One person got to bend the lives of 2 or 3 people around what she wanted. That can\u2019t be ignored just because husband made mistakes as well.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about the husband. How fair is it to kids who are born this way? How fair is it to know you were created and wanted by one parent and not the other? What if the parent who didn\u2019t agree to their whole life changing decides to be done with a life he didn\u2019t choose? I\u2019m that kid, for the record. It sucks.", "My mom was cheating on my dad and convinced my dad that having a kid with him would fix those issues. This was my dads second marriage where he was cheated on and he has gotten drunk many times and told my brother and I (who my mom tricked my dad into) that he regrets having kids. Both of us are closest with my dad but that\u2019s still hard to hear, however it\u2019s much harder to hear that my mom tricked my dad into having 2 kids. I\u2019m about to turn 30 and my brother is about to turn 29, but that doesn\u2019t undermine the pain we have both experienced knowing that my mom tricked and manipulated my dad into having both of us. We both live with that reality and we both hate it. It makes both of us feel guilty about our existence no matter how much our dad genuinely loves us. This is truly the worst situation you can put kids in and you\u2019re delusional if you think that having \u201caccident\u201d kids makes that any better", "Trying to guilt a pregnant woman that doesn't want an abortion into getting an abortion is an asshole move.", "He can't insist on pills, no.

She doesn\u2019t even sound like she cares about her husband not possibly wanting another child. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she told her husband that she was ok with not having child before getting married. \n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of people\u2019s selfish desires.

That doesn't work and end up with a kid he loves but definitely doesn't want another?  GET A VASECTOMY!!!!   \n\nAssuming what you're saying is true and she \"tricked him\" both times?

He is also responsible for those things not just put the blame on her where or not she wanted to baby trap her own husband or not.", "This is dead wrong. The husband is more than capable of using birth control or getting a vasectomy, but you can't force a woman to have an abortion even during an accidental pregnancy. Wtf is wrong with yall, you have no idea yet you immediately accuse the woman.\n\nEdit- If you gonna respond don't be embarrassing and IMMEDIATELY block me so I can't respond. \"This is gibberish\" She said she went off the pill because it didn't agree with her and he knew that. He's a grown man, he's a big boy. He's more than capable of talking to his wife like a big boy and saying he doesn't want more kids.", "Really? Did you read her mind? You have no idea if this is true or not. Lots of people still get pregnant when they do everything they can to prevent it. You've decided she lied and did it on purpose with zero evidence except that she must be a liar if she's female and pregnant. Disgusting misogyny. Did you know her husband can also prevent pregnancy? Why is it only her fault and why do you assume she was purposely deceitful? He had sex too but SHE got HERSELF pregnant. Sure. He's perfectly able to get a vasectomy instead of expecting her birth control to be 100% when, other than sterilization, there is nothing that is 100% effective. But, she's a woman so she must be a snake and a liar, right?", "How is it at all fair to place the blame on OP? It takes two people to make a baby. If OPs husband was that adamant about not wanting kids he shouldn't have married someone who wanted kids, and had a vasectomy.\n\nIF she baby trapped him, sure, she'd be an asshole, but he's just as much of an asshole for marrying a woman who wants kids when be knew well and good he didn't want any.", "OP tried to get pregnant, but this isn't a condom turkey baster situation. Hubby contributed to this pregnancy unless OP flat out lied about birth control. There's no evidence here. This is either NTA or I N F O, no way it's Y T A", "People really don\u2019t want to believe how common BC failure is.", "Yup. If you are absolutely sure you don\u2019t want kids there are ways to prevent it more than just a pill or condom. And people who don\u2019t plan to have children in their relationship take that step, whether it be a vasectomy or tubal because they know what they agree to for their future. OP and her husband are on 2 other levels here and if husband never wanted the role this could backfire on OP. Not that he would abandon his kids, but he may not be able to commit to being a full time 100 percent father when it gets too much for him.", "I don\u2019t know if she intended to get pregnant the first time or not. Birth control isn\u2019t 100% effective even when used as directed. Close to it, but close isn\u2019t 100%. My mom was as anal about taking all medication as anyone can possibly be, especially her birth control. My brother was the result of that small failure rate. It happens.  However, this second pregnancy sounds less like a surprise. Unless they had mutually agreed to have a second baby, she\u2019s an AH for that.\n\nBIL was an AH for sticking his nose where it didn\u2019t belong and for continuing to argue with her.  \n\nWithout a little more info I\u2019m not sure if she was right for ordering her BIL out of the house. I\u2019m leaning towards her being a moderate AH, because she should have told her husband what his brother was saying. It seems like brother didn\u2019t want OP\u2019s husband to know about the ambush.\n\nI do think marriage counseling to improve communication in this marriage would help tremendously. And OP shouldn\u2019t get pregnant again.", "ultimately, i feel like if the husband knew he didnt want kids, he should have gotten a vasectomy. if you're against children but with someone who does, but you're not doing everything you can to protect getting pregnant on your own terms, then your reap what you sew.", "This. 100%.", "Exactly. If he wanted to be absolutely certain he wouldn\u2019t have more kids he had the fairly inexpensive and simple option of vasectomy. It\u2019s unrealistic for him to put the entire responsibility for birth control on the person who wants kids.", "Just because it's \"sexist\" doesn't mean it's not the truth. That has also been my knife experience as well. Men rarely bring these thing up.", "He did communicate. He was clear. OP said so. OP didn't care. Hubby should have left. Hubby stuck with the love of his life who doesn't care about him so much. Agreed, he should get a vasectomy. But he did communicate.", "That was my first thought.  If he didn't want kids, why didn't he get snipped.  There's a lot missing from this story.", "Snip. Snip.", "Exactly. Why is it always the woman's fault?", "AMEN. The husband isn't being forced into anything. He can leave. He can get a vasectomy. He can not have sex. He had options, and he apparently chose not to take any of them. If he stays with his pregnant wife, that is a choice he is making. Many (men) seem to stumble their way through life believing that things just happen TO them, but he is a human being with agency. You have un(der)protected sex, and pregnancy is a possible outcome. This is just as much on him as it is on her. \n\nNow, husband didn't say any of this. It's possible he took his worries and regrets to his brother because he knew it was inappropriate to discuss those feelings with his pregnant wife. But BIL is way out of line playing white knight for his perfectly capable, culpable brother.", "I usually take the whole \"AITA will do outlandish reaches with no substance whatsoever\" with a grain of salt, but my god does it apply here.\n\nUnplanned pregnancies happen all the fucking time. My mom got pregnant with me weeks after she stopped birth control, after being told it'd be months before she could conceive. OP had an unplanned pregnancy, talked it through with her partner, and came to a conclusion they both agree to.\n\nAnd if OP's husband objects to any of it, *he can say so*!! If he's man enough to have sex with OP but not man enough to be open with her about how he feels about having children/another child, only comfortable whinging to someone else, that's on him for not openly communicating! OP can't know what isn't fucking told to her!\n\nNTA. Some people could afford to look up Occam's Razor.", "Straight up!!!! This BIL is telling OP to abort her baby. That would never be his place. If the husband had truly been that concerned, he could've gotten a vasectomy before or after baby #1.", "Indeed, I would kick them out even if indeed I was intending to have an abortion.", "Medical services would call that a planned pregnancy then if neither of you took precautions. \n\nAlthough it would be interesting to hear your husbands side of this also, he could have been telling you what you wanted whilst venting to his family.", "But that's not the case here. He knew she stopped the pill.", "I love how in the comment where she says she stopped taking birth control she also mentions he doesn't wear condoms either. Really convenient for you to leave that part out.", "Birth control is not just her responsibility. His sperm doesn't just magically appear inside of her. If he knew she wasn't taking birth control anymore then he should have been more careful. If he really is that opposed to kids he can also get a vasectomy.", "There's literally a top comment with over 1000 likes blaming the mom.", "Even if he had been angry she\u2019s still NTA. Husband is aware of her not wanting an abortion. He\u2019s also aware of the fact that sex can lead to pregnancy.", "It happens far too often. I would venture to say that it\u2019s probably the case in over half of the marriages in the world. I\u2019ve never wanted kids and am adamantly child free and before I married my husband I made sure he felt the same way. If he were to ever change his mind, we wouldn\u2019t be married anymore. There is no compromise there", "It takes two to make a baby, knowingly making someone your co parent when you know they don\u2019t want to be a parent - makes you an asshole to your children. \n\nESH expect those poor kids.", "Or don\u2019t be an asshole to your future kids by making it so one of their parents don\u2019t want them. Find someone who wants to have baby\u2019s with you. \n\nESH", "Yup. My husband changed his mind about having a kid with me. (He was older and didn't want a retirement kid) I said great, I'll adjust, go get a vasectomy. He did within a month. \n\nHusband wants no kids, then go get it taken care of. No reason wife should do it, since if things didn't work out, she'd have to get the procedure reversed.\n\nNTA", "I gave one for you!", "Me too, while I didn't at like 24 because it wasn't such a focus, dating in my 30s I was always upfront I didn't want kids but was absolutely fine with kids they already had. \nSometimes it means you aren't compatible but it's not worth compromising on a huge thing!", "That's not always fool proof as life and people experiencing it change. I've seen one spouse ending up wanting children, or a child popping up suddenly and everything changes. I definitely have the bias of my world view when it comes to this situation so it seems like the most strange thing ever. Unless completely sterile, two people married, having sex whether protected or unprotected are st risk of having a kid. It's a natural result of sex and it's biological function.", "Agreed, however I'm a child free woman and the amount of men in all age groups that tell me they don't know whether they want children shocks me. They often tell me they never really thought about it, and these are middle aged men in their 30s and 40s! So you can ask but it will often only get you so far.", "Even get go agreements change in the thick of things. I had to power couple friends who wanted to spend their lives go getting,  traveling and rubbing shoulders with the wealthy and powerful. Both highly educated, never wanted kids, loved ambition in each other, a birth control complication later, they were expecting and now they just bought a ranch in Texas. Things change.", "Not knowing at that stage to me would be a red flag. Like, you haven\u2019t actually thought about your life yet?", "What are DS and DD?"]}
