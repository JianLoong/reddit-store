Yes, he may have overstepped, but I'm much more concerned that he was genuinely trying to help. I'm worried that your husband's brother is saying all of this because your husband has made it clear to him that he does not want to have another child with you.\n\nPlus your comments about your first pregnancy make it clear your husband ONLY agreed to having the first child because you wanted to keep the baby. And, in all honesty, I get the impression you're so wrapped up in excitement about the pregnancy that you want that you're not even thinking about what your husband wants. If he was so anti-kids, baffled as to why there were no serious measures to prevent another accidental pregnancy.\n\nYou need to have an honest discussion with your husband because there's a much bigger issue here.", "Info: what form of birth control has failed twice for you?", "People don't have those opinions out of nowhere - I think, unbeknown to you, your husband has expressed certain concerns to his brother...concerns that were significant enough for his brother to say something.

No. And I bet your husband was annoyed that he did...but perhaps you do need to consider whether or not your husband IS unhappy with the situation and work on that.   \nYou're NTA but perhaps when it comes to how your husband is truly feeling, there are things that he may not feel he can tell you.", "INFO: what did your husband say when you got pregnant for the second time?", "INFO: how did you get pregnant again if he dont want kids. \n\nIm just asking to see if he doesnt understands contraceptives or if you deliberately want to get pregnant again.", "INFO: 2 questions. 1.

My guess is that BIL is repeating your husband's words and although you say he's a wonderful father, maybe he does feel like he was forced into fatherhood and has complained to BIL about it. \n\nSince husband presumably knows where babies come from, he should have taken steps to prevent baby #2 if it is not 100% wanted and/or you two as parents are not capable of providing everything that these children need. If husband was really on board for baby #2, then he should have handled things immediately with BIL and stood up for you.", "INFO: were you and your husband trying to get pregnant?", "NTA, though I think your husband sent his brother as a proxy.

And just because he loves the first kid doesn\u2019t mean he is happy with having kids or wants more. It definitely seems like the BIL is going off of things he\u2019s heard from OP\u2019s husband. In my opinion OP is TA (and so is her husband) for staying in a relationship with and continuing to sleep with someone that they had an absolutely fundamental incompatibility with. As soon as it was known she 100% wanted kids and he didn\u2019t, they should\u2019ve gone their separate ways. As someone who 100% does not want kids, that\u2019s the type of dealbreaker you screen for either before even going on a date with someone (I make it very clear on dating profiles that I am only seeking to date childfree people who do not want kids) or on the first date to avoid wasting your time. People who don\u2019t want kids shouldn\u2019t have kids. It doesn\u2019t matter that now that the kid born he loves the kid, plenty of people regret kids that they love and are unhappy as parents, and now the fact that OP is having a second child with someone who *never wanted kids* is just idiotic and will have harmful effects whether OP sees them now or not.\n\nThe BIL is not TA, he seems to be the only one looking at this remotely reasonably, and definitely seems to be going off of what he\u2019s heard from OP\u2019s husband, why else would he be saying these things if he thought or knew OP\u2019s husband was happy with having a kid and/or continuing to have kids? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s already brought dissatisfaction to OP\u2019s husband\u2019s life that has been expressed to the BIL and that is what BIL\u2019s statements were based on. Like I said, tons and tons of people regret kids they love and are unhappy being parents even if they love their kids. Having kids for someone else\u2019s happiness is just the worst decision to ever make, along with continuing to date and sleep with someone who wants kids when you don\u2019t, but OP decides to ignore that and then scapegoat the BIL for being based in reality, for that both OP and her husband are TA to me.", "I knew a woman that baby trapped her husband twice.

Leave my wife?\". The latter is enthusiasm that becomes a choice. And even if your husband ended up loving his son, it does not mean that parenthood is something he enjoys. Those two are also two separate things. \n\nI think the ESH started when a child free person and  a non child free person knowingly decided to get married. They knew that one of them would actively not have the life and future they wanted...and decided it was fine to impose parenthood or childlessness unto a loved one who would not have made that choice. Had you been the child wanting man and had he been a childfree woman, a baby would have never happened. How would you feel then? Would you feel like childlessness was imposed unto you? I think you would.\n\nIf the second pregnancy was planned, it's fine. No one is A for this instance.

Could there be a possibility that he and your husband discussed children in the past, and both agreed that they wanted to be child free(before they were married/met their partners), so BIL may see husband having kids as some 'betrayal' due to that? That may be a wild reach, but it's strange that BIL is having such a massive reaction to this on your husbands behalf\n\nPlease make sure to have an open conversation with your husband, if you haven't alresdy. Ask him how he truly feels about your 2nd pregnancy, does he regret not using protection, when you came off the pill did he think about how there is now a possibility of pregnancy happening? If he is happy to answer, then I think it's also important to ask husband if he's been confiding in BIL. Is BIL expressing something that husband said to him in private, that BIL is now saying on husbands behalf?\n\nI know many details get missed in reddit posts, but if you haven't already done so, you and husband really need a discussion about the future too.

Things like that absolutely need to be discussed, to make sure there isn't any resentment or hidden feelings that could build and build inside your hubby and end up badly. In general it's important to pre discuss and plan how many kids/when, especially so here.
