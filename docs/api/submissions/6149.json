No one just sees a pregnant married woman and pulls what he said out of thin air.", "Does your husband want a second child?\n\n\nYou write over and over again about how he's a great dad and loves your current kid....but mention that your current kid was unplanned and make absolutely no mention of if this kid was.", "I'd assume the BIL is having conversations with his brother that you aren't privy to. Best guess is your husband told him he doesn't want more kids and feels like this is being forced onto him loke the first kid was.

Yes, he may have overstepped, but I'm much more concerned that he was genuinely trying to help. I'm worried that your husband's brother is saying all of this because your husband has made it clear to him that he does not want to have another child with you.\n\nPlus your comments about your first pregnancy make it clear your husband ONLY agreed to having the first child because you wanted to keep the baby. And, in all honesty, I get the impression you're so wrapped up in excitement about the pregnancy that you want that you're not even thinking about what your husband wants. If he was so anti-kids, baffled as to why there were no serious measures to prevent another accidental pregnancy.\n\nYou need to have an honest discussion with your husband because there's a much bigger issue here.\n\nETA: Just saw the responses from OP about her husband knowing she was no longer on birth control, and neither of them were using any protection. This definitely changes things, I won't even pretend to understand what is happening at this point.

No. And I bet your husband was annoyed that he did...but perhaps you do need to consider whether or not your husband IS unhappy with the situation and work on that.   \nYou're NTA but perhaps when it comes to how your husband is truly feeling, there are things that he may not feel he can tell you.", "INFO: what did your husband say when you got pregnant for the second time?", "INFO: how did you get pregnant again if he dont want kids. \n\nIm just asking to see if he doesnt understands contraceptives or if you deliberately want to get pregnant again.", "INFO: 2 questions. 1.

He will love the kids of course but it won't be enough. If you stay married until the last kid graduates HS he will leave. He will be bitter and resentful of the choices you made for him. Whether it really was 2 unplanned pregnancies or not he will always wonder. He will ask himself why he didn't get fixed (because you would have walked).\n\nYou will be angry and hurt because he is bitter and resentful.

My guess is that BIL is repeating your husband's words and although you say he's a wonderful father, maybe he does feel like he was forced into fatherhood and has complained to BIL about it. \n\nSince husband presumably knows where babies come from, he should have taken steps to prevent baby #2 if it is not 100% wanted and/or you two as parents are not capable of providing everything that these children need. If husband was really on board for baby #2, then he should have handled things immediately with BIL and stood up for you.", "INFO: were you and your husband trying to get pregnant?", "NTA, though I think your husband sent his brother as a proxy.

It was not BIL\u2019s job to discuss this with you if your husband has concerns, and you are not the asshole for refusing to discuss it with him.

You are all assholes.", "NTA\nI dont know or care beyond typing this if either pregnancy was truly an accident but if your husband didn't get a vasectomy after the first, it's on him.\n\nBil was out of line.", "NTA. You\u2019re already pregnant, so what a disgusting thing to say. And it\u2019s none of his business. Your husband knowingly engaged in baby making relations, no?

But not for drawing boundaries with your BIL. \n\nBut you should know, everything from your BIL, he 100% heard it from your husband. You two need to talk this out.

Everything is fine and dandy till love fades and resentment builds and parenthood feels like a straight jacket.", "The big question your story leaves is how planned your second pregnancy is. Did you both want it? Did you want it and he didn't? Did he want it and you not? Was it a accident, or planned?\n\nYour BIL is a AH, true.

In my opinion OP is TA (and so is her husband) for staying in a relationship with and continuing to sleep with someone that they had an absolutely fundamental incompatibility with. As soon as it was known she 100% wanted kids and he didn\u2019t, they should\u2019ve gone their separate ways. As someone who 100% does not want kids, that\u2019s the type of dealbreaker you screen for either before even going on a date with someone (I make it very clear on dating profiles that I am only seeking to date childfree people who do not want kids) or on the first date to avoid wasting your time. People who don\u2019t want kids shouldn\u2019t have kids. It doesn\u2019t matter that now that the kid born he loves the kid, plenty of people regret kids that they love and are unhappy as parents, and now the fact that OP is having a second child with someone who *never wanted kids* is just idiotic and will have harmful effects whether OP sees them now or not.\n\nThe BIL is not TA, he seems to be the only one looking at this remotely reasonably, and definitely seems to be going off of what he\u2019s heard from OP\u2019s husband, why else would he be saying these things if he thought or knew OP\u2019s husband was happy with having a kid and/or continuing to have kids? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s already brought dissatisfaction to OP\u2019s husband\u2019s life that has been expressed to the BIL and that is what BIL\u2019s statements were based on. Like I said, tons and tons of people regret kids they love and are unhappy being parents even if they love their kids. Having kids for someone else\u2019s happiness is just the worst decision to ever make, along with continuing to date and sleep with someone who wants kids when you don\u2019t, but OP decides to ignore that and then scapegoat the BIL for being based in reality, for that both OP and her husband are TA to me.", "I knew a woman that baby trapped her husband twice.

Those two are also two separate things. \n\nI think the ESH started when a child free person and  a non child free person knowingly decided to get married. They knew that one of them would actively not have the life and future they wanted...and decided it was fine to impose parenthood or childlessness unto a loved one who would not have made that choice. Had you been the child wanting man and had he been a childfree woman, a baby would have never happened. How would you feel then? Would you feel like childlessness was imposed unto you?

Ask him how he truly feels about your 2nd pregnancy, does he regret not using protection, when you came off the pill did he think about how there is now a possibility of pregnancy happening? If he is happy to answer, then I think it's also important to ask husband if he's been confiding in BIL.

Things like that absolutely need to be discussed, to make sure there isn't any resentment or hidden feelings that could build and build inside your hubby and end up badly. In general it's important to pre discuss and plan how many kids/when, especially so here.

He is still has some responsibility on him to protect himself and if he chooses not to he has to accept pregnancy is possible. But he is a grown man.

Yes he doesn't want a second child - he also would very much like to maintain his wife's happiness.
