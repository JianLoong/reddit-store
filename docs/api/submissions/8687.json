Primarily because you were undermining his attempts to give you exactly what you wanted!\n\nYou want to spend more time together. Understandable and reasonable to want (and hopefully he feels the same).\nSo he tries to crash-course his way through these trips to get more done in less time and free up some more time for you to spend together.

He has some restraint if he's just being argumentative!\n\nShow some appreciation for the hell he's putting himself through *for you*. Try to be supportive and listen when he tells you what he's going through without thinking about how hard you have it.

You don't get to dictate the schedule in those trips as someone who invited themselves into it. I can understand your husband's frustration and the reason why he pointed out you are not coming to the next one. Because you possibly ruined the trip along with important work meetings/connections/opportunities. Also, just  because you are married for 4 months does not mean he should cater his work schedule for you. If you are upset about this, instead of stringing along, you talk with him about it.", "YTA.

When I get back to my hotel room, I just want to shower and go right to bed. After forcing your way along, you complained about how demanding work is and caused him to have to cut his trip short. Business trips are stressful and demanding enough on their own, I can't imagine having to cater to the whining of a grown adult who literally doesn't have to do shit during that time, but relax and have fun. \n\nIn what alternate, self-absorbed plane of reality do you exist where you even have to ask if you WTA?", "YTA. You should have kept quiet and then not asked to join him in the future.", "YTA for probably a few reasons. First for interfering with his work, and two for inviting yourself.  \n\nI'm married and used to travel for work.  There were instances when spouses were invited and then times where someone would bring their spouse who pretty much invited themselves and it was fucking awkward for everyone. One time,  we had an extremely challenging client in Chicago.  Our hours were long and we often would work at dinner. The husband threw an almighty fit that we were working at dinner one night,  making a public scene in front of everyone.  Then there were conferences in Hawaii,  which was an obvious time where everyone brought their spouse or SO.  If you're not invited,  there is probably a reason.", "Yep YTA for sure.", "YTA - you basically invited yourself on his work trip and then complained that you didn\u2019t like it.  This resulted in him doing less work than he wanted to get accomplished.  That\u2019s why you bring a good book and have a few movies downloaded so that you have a way to pass the time if you aren\u2019t up for going out.   Or, better yet, don\u2019t invite yourself on other people\u2019s business trips\u2026", "YTA. You sound like a brat. What were you expecting on a business trip? To go see all the tourist spots? Get real", "YTA are you serious? You demand to go on a trip and then completely implode over it while on the trip???? AND it was a business trip for him so he is having to manage both his professional life and you acting a fool? Nope.", "YTA.

Have you ever thought that you might've been getting in his way of work and yet he had agreed along with you initially.", "yta", "Yes YTA.

You are away from the people you love. \n\nYou have to understand he can\u2019t be with you. He\u2019s working. Unless you enjoy solo travel, you should stay home.

I had two small kids and was terrified to be alone for 4-5 days, so I insisted on coming with. I spent most of time stuck in a tiny room, alone with a toddler and an infant. Even when my husband was in the room with us, he still had to work. He was catching up on his daily tasks that weren't getting done during his all day meetings/conferences. It was miserable!

When plans changed and you had to move around you elected to go home by yourself, which he chose against and went home with you. Then you decided going with him wasn\u2019t a good idea based on that first experience. He chose to end his trip early, which was a nice gesture but unnecessary, then made assumptions you were going to demand to go again without talking to you before lashing out. So I think some communication would be beneficial for both of you but you weren\u2019t wrong to want to spend more time with your husband.", "Leaning toward ESH because it seems like this issue could have been easily been avoided with a little clear communication up front, which either of you could have initiated. He could have thought to say, \u201cyou can come with, but jsyk, this is what you should expect regarding our schedule and travel itinerary.\u201d Just as easily, you could have asked for more info like that about the trip in order make a more informed decision.

I'd get an adventure, and I'd still get to sleep next to my sweet baboo. \n\nBut I've also traveled myself for business, and the only way I got to see friends in the places I traveled to was if they were either willing to come out late at short notice, or if they were working for one of the groups we were meeting with...\n\nI'm good on my own, so I can travel with someone, but you gotta know what you're getting into if you're gonna try. \n\nAnd OP - I get where you're coming from, and you were definitely foolish to ask to come along on a business trip, but I don't think it rises to AH behavior. I think your husband was trying to teach you why you don't want to come on business trips, thus the change of plans, but I'm still going say:\n\nNAH", "People who haven't done it have no idea. It is dreadful and post 9/11 even worse. I love that post-COVID has made work travel so much less necessary...no point \"traveling to client worksite\" when client is all remote anyway!", "Honestly this still sounds pretty nice to me. You don't get to do much sightseeing but kinda nice to even do small things like eat dinner in restaurants and travel to the office. Obviously, it's still a full-time job and if anyone thinks you're not working those hours then they're silly, but I still think it sounds quite nice.", "I think your second-to-last sentence outlines why she is with him.", "I guess if he would not go home earlier as planned she will either complain the whole time (as she did all the trip) or be upset about he wouldn't go home early (hypocrisy and entitlement).", "That sounds like New Orleans", "People laugh at this American for going to McDonald's in Europe. But that was where I knew there would be good bathrooms.", "My friend, that's the smell of everywhere. Try traveling in Central America or southeast Asia. Pisssss.", "The true purpose of McDonald's is to provide bathrooms.", "I piss in alleyways, I have class.\n\nThough that was Quebec.", "Its common knowledge that they dont care about the homelessness or drug problem. They dont want to pay to build or maintain the restrooms. This applies almost everywhere", "best crap of my life happened in a Subway (restaurant) single user bathroom in Amsterdam. \n\nthe *sandwich artist* thought i probably had gone in for nefarious purposes so she left the counter to check the bathroom as soon as i left and i felt so bad lol", "It was 8 years ago or more, and I didn't have internet access because I didn't have international roaming data.", "I went in 2019 and had a lovely time. We did Paris, Amsterdam, Cologne and London and Paris was my favorite by far. I had heard all the stereotypes and was so pleasantly surprised to not run into any of them during our trip. Lovely city, lovely people.", "There's a place in Hull, UK that is also a facility for drug users. They have clean needles and syringes, etc for them to use and private booths, as well as staff on hand in case anything goes wrong.", "Yes, they're there to supervise people using. It prevents diseases from being spread, keeps needles out of the streets and places kids go, and makes sure nobody overdoses. Iceland, like other places in the world, realize that you can't just stop drug use, and are trying to control it and help people. All these sites also have information for rehab, for anyone that wants to try getting help, because drug addiction is a dangerous af disease", "I'm dying! Kids are great for saying super embarrassing things as loud as possible.", "Spot on.\n\n& I didn't even mention going to the police station that was barricaded and sandbagged w 3 guys w uzis. \ud83d\ude44", "all bigger cities in western civilisation look & feel the same IMHO... people may speak a different language but doesn't matter if you're in NYC, Paris, London, Berlin, Buenos Aires or Toronto... there's tall buildings and lots of people... nothing really unique about them... people are rude and in a rush and that's that...", "I don\u2019t get it, where did OP say they were needing their husband to entertain them? There was nothing about not respecting his schedule only that the jet lag was so bad they wanted to leave early - not that everyone should leave early\u2026", "Same thought. He makes it awful so she won\u2019t want to come again.", "Probably something outrageous like 'please'", ">Anywhere touristy is overrun with thieves and dealers who piss everywhere, and are likely to harass and rob you.\n\nThis is true for like 99.99% of places.", "Tons of public sidewalk bathrooms, they are little pods you pay a euro or two to use, no big deal.", "How long ago was your trip? There are self cleaning public restrooms all over Paris", "I don't know what you're talking about. I've been there multiple times and I have never had those issues.", "As a man with a small bladder, I'm a fan of the outdoor pissers they have in Victoria. Very nice and breezy.", "Vancouver and many Canadian cities have had supervised injection sites for over a decade. They also have safe supply programs where they give you drugs so won\u2019t die of tainted fentanyl. \n\nNone of that changes the lack of access to bathrooms! It\u2019s horrible. There\u2019s nowhere to pee. It\u2019s cruel. \n\nThat said finding a dead person in the bathroom of your pizza joint is a legitimately jarring and traumatic experience."]}
