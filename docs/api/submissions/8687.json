Primarily because you were undermining his attempts to give you exactly what you wanted!\n\nYou want to spend more time together. Understandable and reasonable to want (and hopefully he feels the same).\nSo he tries to crash-course his way through these trips to get more done in less time and free up some more time for you to spend together. As you've learned, not a fun experience and very gruelling, so he must seriously want to get that free time together if he's going through all that.\n\nAnd you then insist on coming along, when you should know that you won't really have time together while he's working, making him more aware of how grindy his days are by chilling around while he burns himself out, slowing his pace and undoing some of the ground he has gained - effectively meaning you either get less time together than he had planned on, or he has to go even harder next trip or two - and then you complain about how hard it is for *you*? He has some restraint if he's just being argumentative!\n\nShow some appreciation for the hell he's putting himself through *for you*. Try to be supportive and listen when he tells you what he's going through without thinking about how hard you have it. And maybe, when he's cooled down, talk to him about maybe going a little easier on himself: that kind of load is unsustainable long term, and he needs to have some kind of reasonable end date or a viable middle ground before he burns himself out or makes himself ill.", "YTA you invited yourself on your husband\u2019s business trip.

You don't get to dictate the schedule in those trips as someone who invited themselves into it. I can understand your husband's frustration and the reason why he pointed out you are not coming to the next one. Because you possibly ruined the trip along with important work meetings/connections/opportunities. Also, just  because you are married for 4 months does not mean he should cater his work schedule for you. If you are upset about this, instead of stringing along, you talk with him about it.", "YTA.

When you travel for business, it usually means long, exhausting days. For reference, when I travel for work, I'm booked from 7/8 AM until 9/10 PM. When I get back to my hotel room, I just want to shower and go right to bed. After forcing your way along, you complained about how demanding work is and caused him to have to cut his trip short. Business trips are stressful and demanding enough on their own, I can't imagine having to cater to the whining of a grown adult who literally doesn't have to do shit during that time, but relax and have fun. \n\nIn what alternate, self-absorbed plane of reality do you exist where you even have to ask if you WTA?", "YTA. You should have kept quiet and then not asked to join him in the future.", "YTA for probably a few reasons. First for interfering with his work, and two for inviting yourself.  \n\nI'm married and used to travel for work.  There were instances when spouses were invited and then times where someone would bring their spouse who pretty much invited themselves and it was fucking awkward for everyone. One time,  we had an extremely challenging client in Chicago.  Our hours were long and we often would work at dinner. The husband threw an almighty fit that we were working at dinner one night,  making a public scene in front of everyone.  Then there were conferences in Hawaii,  which was an obvious time where everyone brought their spouse or SO.  If you're not invited,  there is probably a reason.", "Yep YTA for sure.", "YTA - you basically invited yourself on his work trip and then complained that you didn\u2019t like it.  This resulted in him doing less work than he wanted to get accomplished.  That\u2019s why you bring a good book and have a few movies downloaded so that you have a way to pass the time if you aren\u2019t up for going out.   Or, better yet, don\u2019t invite yourself on other people\u2019s business trips\u2026", "YTA. You sound like a brat. What were you expecting on a business trip? To go see all the tourist spots? Get real", "YTA are you serious? You demand to go on a trip and then completely implode over it while on the trip???? AND it was a business trip for him so he is having to manage both his professional life and you acting a fool? Nope.", "YTA. Your husband was completely right when he told you that you invited yourself. Have you ever thought that you might've been getting in his way of work and yet he had agreed along with you initially.", "yta", "Yes YTA. People who don\u2019t travel for work often have no idea how demanding it is and how much work you do (prep time, meetings, travel , follow up items and mtgs related to that).

You are away from the people you love. \n\nYou have to understand he can\u2019t be with you. He\u2019s working. Unless you enjoy solo travel, you should stay home.

I had two small kids and was terrified to be alone for 4-5 days, so I insisted on coming with. I spent most of time stuck in a tiny room, alone with a toddler and an infant. Even when my husband was in the room with us, he still had to work. He was catching up on his daily tasks that weren't getting done during his all day meetings/conferences. It was miserable!

When plans changed and you had to move around you elected to go home by yourself, which he chose against and went home with you. Then you decided going with him wasn\u2019t a good idea based on that first experience. He chose to end his trip early, which was a nice gesture but unnecessary, then made assumptions you were going to demand to go again without talking to you before lashing out. So I think some communication would be beneficial for both of you but you weren\u2019t wrong to want to spend more time with your husband.", "Leaning toward ESH because it seems like this issue could have been easily been avoided with a little clear communication up front, which either of you could have initiated. He could have thought to say, \u201cyou can come with, but jsyk, this is what you should expect regarding our schedule and travel itinerary.\u201d Just as easily, you could have asked for more info like that about the trip in order make a more informed decision.

Since you insisted, perhaps keeping quiet about not feeling well and resting while he was working so you might feel better part of the way thru so you could enjoy some of it.  But the purpose was not to entertain you, it was work for him.  If he could carve out any time for you then great but now you know not to do this again.", "YTA \n\nGuess what YOUR HUSBAND WAS WORKING! It wasn't the time for togetherness.", "[removed]", "The move is to head up a few days BEFORE the trip, hang out together WITHOUT work for a few days, and then HEAD HOME when the meetings start. If you are self sufficient, you can ALSO stay an explore areas on your own while he is in meetings, but you aren\u2019t. So you HEAD HOME.", "Agreed.  Soft YTA. More like a dick thing, less of an AH thing. She planned to return home on her own but he insisted on cutting his own trip short to go back with her. He didn't have to. That wasn't specifically her fault and shouldn't be held against her, by reddit or by her husband. But turning what seems to be a difficult stressful job into something grueling, OPs very wrong for that. But tbf, she didn't realize all that his trips entailed. Lesson learned. I'm kinda glad she got to experience it first hand though, so that she's not in her feels if he's gone longer than expected or doesn't respond/ call regularly. She can definitely trust and believe her man's just out there handling business. \n\nIf OP wants to spend time with hubs when he travels, I would say get a feel for his itinerary, plan a separate trip and separate plans for yourself, with a plan to be together for a particular time before he has to go back to work. And absolutely do take yourself back home. I'm sure that approach would be more appreciated. A lil covert meet up might even add a bit of sexy spontaneity to your relationship.", "When I travel for work, yes. Meetings start at 8 or 9 then you do work things all day and then typically have meetings over dinner. It's expensive to travel so you try to get the most out of it.", "Depends on the occupation but when dealing with international clients this isn\u2019t unusual. Visiting one city means you\u2019re likely closer to other clients in other cities then you were before the trip. \n\nIf, when visiting Berlin from America, your client in Paris is suddenly available to meet then you\u2019re going to go to Paris. If your client in London hears you\u2019re in Europe and mentions they can meet up then you meet up because the opportunity is too rare to pass up.\n\nThere are also occupations where things change fast. You may have higher ups who notice you\u2019re visiting a location and then ask you check on other things \u201csince you\u2019re there.\u201d \n\nMy big question is traveling expenses are usually paid for by the company. Who is paying for the OP?", "I was a road warrior for over a decade. Business travel can suck.", "I was just thinking the same thing.

I get the feeling this was not a coincidence.", "Yeah, pre pandemic when I had to travel for meetings a few times a year, they were not fun. You wake up at like 5am to get some work out of the way, get ready for breakfast at 6am, breakfast and hobnobbing at 7, meetings from 8 to noon, more hobnobbing at lunch, meetings from 1 to 3. Rush back to the room to try and cram a day of work into a couple hours. Get ready for dinner, then hobnobbing and dinner, then hobnobbing and drinks or award ceremonies until God knows when. Repeat for a week. They're grueling.", "He said they're sometimes like this but in this case he said he was trying to free up his schedule so we could spend time together which was why it was so bad. The original trip was only supposed to be to Berlin and then home.", "Yep. I don't think they're an AH for wanting to go and it sounds like just simple ignorance about what he actually does on a trip. Their union is new (4mos) so I assume this will be a good learning experience- now she knows what it's like out there for him.\nAlso yep, complaining about it wasn't helpful at all and made a tough time tougher. At least now she can stay back knowing exactly what he's dealing with and be more supportive of him.", "\"it took some convincing\" to go, and \"after a lot of arguments he decided to cut the trip short\", she just loves to argue/fight with the new husband it seems.\n\nWhile she's saying here that she offered to fly alone, but i have a feeling that if the husband had \"let her\" fly alone, then OP would have picked a fight over that too.", "[removed]", "I also say NAH because she just didn\u2019t understand what a business trip was like and just wanted to spend more time with him. But now she knows. He was probably just a little annoyed after so I can see why he would lash out a little about it. Most people I\u2019d imagine would do the same.", "This is so true! And there are different types of business trips. I go with my husband all the time but he goes to conferences and continuing ed events. He\u2019s not making business sales calls or appointments.

Her husband could have circled back. It's extra hotel $$, but the dollar/euro ratio is great right now. You have to entertain yourself on those things.", "Yeah that part she is not an AH, but the complaining and making him change his work schedule definitely makes her the AH.", "They're being hard on OP because her husband told her what it would be like, and she refused to believe him. \n\nI used to go with my husband on business trips occasionally, and when he was working I would do my own thing and not bother him at all.  It worked out fine - but only because I didn't expect him to entertain me or accompany me everywhere.", "This is what I was thinking, I've been to science conferences where people brought their spouses and it WAS a mini-vacation for the spouses, since they got to spend time in the hotel spa while the scientists were attending the lectures (and in one case there was even an excursion to Mt. Etna planned as part of the conference, and spouses could pay to attend even if they weren't involved in the conference). Similarly, my Dad invites me to the cycling holiday/retreats he organizes even though I don't cycle, because it means I get to relax in the hotel room or by the pool during the day but still see him for lunch and dinner. Spending one week in Berlin would be along those lines. \n\nI'm curious about when and why the plan changed (especially since OP's husband seems to have been able to pick where he was going to some extent, as he chose to go home early with her and mentioned trying to get all the work out of the way for her) and whether OP was told in advance what the travel plan was going to be, or given a chance to drop out once it changed.", "That is not necessarily true.

The fact that OP decided to treat it like one and then was upset when the husband didn\u2019t do the same definitely means YTA.", "My husband and I went to Paris on our honeymoon. He'd been there several times for business so I asked him what he liked best about the city on his other visits to help plan our trip.

The rest of the trip was just me and the kids on our own sightseeing.  We all knew this, it was a work trip for him and a vacation for me and the kids.

That's it.", "Before we retired, SO used to do a fair amount of travelling and I would walk around a city during the day while he worked, then we\u2019d have dinner together. Was a lot of fun, so it can work, but both parties have to understand that while one is there on a trip, the other is working, so their schedule is what sets the pace. Op possibly needs more stamina.

The only people that think business travel is exciting are those that don't have to do it.", "I used to travel for work, although I stopped back around 2014 and transitioned to something else in the company. Same thing to start, but would spend my Mondays and Tuesdays conducting training sessions from 8:30 to 5:00, after which I was too beat to do anything but grab dinner and veg in my hotel room. Wednesday off to another city, rinse and repeat Thursday and Friday. Sometimes I'd have enough energy to do something on Saturday before traveling to the next city on Sunday. Mostly, though, I'd take the day to rest and recharge.
