You might have said \"I agree to no dogs (unless my parents give me back my dog)\" but he probably only heard \"I agree to no dogs\".\n\nEven if you have the lowest maintenance, best behaved, most angelic dog that there ever was, bringing a dog into the household for more than a weekend is a major change that deserves discussion and input from all members of the household. It's not a surprise that your partner has moved out and isn't paying rent and it won't be a surprise when your partner breaks up with you and comes to get all of his stuff.\n\nYou got upset and caused a big argument when he brought home goldfish. Goldfish don't cover everything in fur, need to be let outside at 3am, cost $100 every 3-4 weeks to feed, need to be walked daily, brushed etc. Him bringing home fish and your bringing home a dog are not the same and to suggest that they are, insults the intelligence of your partner.\n\nYou're N T A for picking your dog over your long term partner, but YTA for the whole way you went about this.", ">I told him that I'm not giving up my fur baby and he either needs to accept him or move out. \n\n>He is now staying at a friend's and is refusing to pay his share of the rent. \n\nYou gave him the option to move out, he moved out, and now you're pissed he's not paying rent?\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but there's a big difference between a dog and a goldfish. And it sounds like you blew a shit fit over the goldfish, but now expect him to be fine with a dog? A dog you haven't even seen in 5 years? You're delusional. Oh, and YTA.", "You gave him an ultimatum. Accept an animal that he hates living in his home with you KNOWING that he hates them and choosing to bring one in anyway, or leave. He left. \n\nNot sure what you expected the outcome to be, but you made your bed. Time to lie in it. Hopefully the dog fulfils all of the relationship needs that you had of a partner of five years cause I'm pretty sure he ain't comin' back.\n\nI know I wouldn't. YTA. And also more than a bit stupid if you thought you'd get a different result.", "YTA\nJust cause you expect him to pay rent after YOU brought a dog back, YOU ask him to move out, he did. Now he has to pay rent? Why?", "A goldfish is not even remotely the same thing as a dog. I find it very hard to believe that you genuinely think that's the same. Goldfish don't make noise. They don't need to be walked. They don't shed etc. Pretty much all the potential things that would \"bother\" someone who doesn't like pets obviously don't apply to goldfish. Why were you even mad about that? Because *technically* it's a pet? Seems irrational. \n\nI think your partner has the right to be upset considering you agreed to be pet free, and you suddenly changed your mind. You have the right to do that. It's a unique situation. You love that particular dog and the only reason you were pet free was because you couldn't have YOUR dog. Now you can have him, so you want to keep him. I get it, but I also understand why he's upset. I wanna say YTA not because you want to keep the dog, but more because of your attitude. \"Well he brought home a goldfish, so he broke our agreement first. (silly comparison) And I'm not giving up my dog (that I agreed not to have at the start of the relationship) for my boyfriend that I've been with for 5 years. If he doesn't like it, he can leave.\" Did he know that you loved that particular dog, and you only agreed to be pet free because you couldn't have YOUR dog, or did he genuinely think you didn't like dogs at all and therefore never entertained the possibility of you guys ever owning one? Did you try talking to him and explaining why the dog is so important to you? It doesn't sound like it, but if you did you should have added that to the post to make his \"jerkiness\" more clear. Either way, I understand why you want to keep a dog that is special to you, but it doesn't sound to me like your BF is the AH or that he's a hypocrite because of the goldfish thing. You're NTA for wanting to keep the dog, but your attitude kinda makes you sound like one.", "You're NTA for wanting to take in the dog. \n\nYTA for everything else. A goldfish is NOT the same and a dog and you both obviously don't respect each others feelings at all. Get your dog and move on with your life", "If you want the dog you should break up with your partner. \n\nYou agreed to be pet free, and therefore are crossing a boundary. YTA\n\nPeople may think your bf is an AH but he made it clear he doesn\u2019t want dogs and you went against one and brought it into your shared home. I wouldn\u2019t pay rent either. Your dog should pay rent since you picked him over your partner", "YTA but not for picking your dog over him. I would have done that as well, but expecting him to be okay with it and continue paying rent in a no longer pet free home is unreasonable. Comparing a dog to a goldfish is also silly. He\u2019s not in any way obligated to accept your dog and he\u2019s not unreasonable for leaving.", "> When me and my partner met we both agreed that we wanted to be child and pet free.\n\n> My partner is pissed, he hates dogs, I told him that I'm not giving up my fur baby and he either needs to accept him or move out.\n\nYes, YTA for going back on your agreement.", "YTA for asking him to pay rent after asking him to move out. Also, this relationship is over.", "YTA, Im a dog lover and understand where you are coming from. But why wouldn't you discuss this from him? especially after you made an agreement to be dog and child free. If he came home with a child you wouldn't be too happy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Edit: I missed the bit about the goldfish, a goldfish needs minimal care and attention compared to a dog, which is as you say a fur baby and will need constant care and attention.", ">I think this is justified, a couple of years ago he came home with a goldfish out of nowhere, it caused a big argument at the time but we got through it, I told him this is no different and he needs to accept it.\n\nYTA just for this \n\nA goldfish is in a bowl, it doesn't leave fur everywhere, chew your stuff or pee on the carpet. \n\nI love dogs, but to claim they are the same level pet as a fish, is just silly!", "Imagine if he came home and said \"honey I found out I have a 6yo kid from a previous relationship, I know we said we'd be child free but they are going to live here now because it's my baby and I have an emotional connection\" and when you then say that you don't want any kids he then retorts with; \"Then you can move out, oh and btw, you still have to pay rent\"\n\nThats a better comparison then a goldfish which is decorative (with a little care ofcourse) \n\nYTA. You took the dog in, you said if he didn't like it he could leave, he called your bluf and did indeed leave. Shouldn't have said that if you didn't want him to leave. And not paying rent when he doesn't live there is no more then logical", "YTA\n\nYou can't unilaterally decide to move a dog in, knowing that your partner hates dogs, demand from your \"partner\" to accept this or move out and when he does move out expect him to still pay rent?\n\nExtra-yta btw for calling your dog fur baby, that's so urgh.", "YTA. You gave him an ultimatum. He chose to leave. You don't get to be mad, because he made the choice your didn't want him to make. You broke the agreement. If you didn't want him to leave you should have not brought the dog into your house. Plus it's not your baby, it's a DOG.", "I mean, you already gave up your \"fur baby\" when you allowed your parents to claim ownership. If you really wanted him, you would have done whatever it took to keep him.And then you vowed to never own a pet again and you and your partner formed a relationship where that agreement was in place.\n\nIf I was in a relationship for that long and my partner said \"it's this dog or you\", I'd feel pretty shitty.\n\nAlso, you're comparing a GOLDFISH to a DOG? That's stupid.\n\nYour partner has every right to be furious, you chose a dog over him. You should move out, not him.\n\nYTA.", "NTA for choosing your dog. But YTA for accepting the dog without talking to your partner. As well after you both said you would be a pet free.\n\nYeah the relationship seems to be over. But the two of you should have a talk. Especially of moving out and paying rent. The two of you should have lease and depending on who is on it, what are the time periodes to end it, what it says about pets it is a different situation. But you should not expect your partner to pay for a flat he is not living in anymore, anymore than he has to pay legally (and even then he might would look into loopholes to get you kicked out or at least the dog for the remaining time of the lease)", "Looks like you both need to move on, over a dog and a gold fish.", "YTA\n\nPurely based on the fact that you made the boundaries and rules with your partner quite clearly prior to chosing eachother as partners. And now instead of admitting to him that you are reneging, you are only willing to see your motivation for doing so, and not understanding how that in and off itself doesnt alter the fact that YOU are the one crossing the boundary you two firmly established together.\n\nYou have no right to the surprised pikachu face. YOU changed, not him. He is the one who is betrayed.\n\nFor what its worth, I'd do the same thing as you have, and taken the dog in. BUT unlike you, I wouldnt be refusing to admit that I was making a change that I knew he wouldnt be able to live with, - and I would have apologised to him as well, to make sure I wasnt behaving as though his feelings were not valid. As someone who would chose a dog over a human however, I find it very disingenous of you to compare one to a gold fish. I mean come on\\`?! - If this is how you've been acting with regards to these discussions, you are being absolutely obnoxious.\n\nOn top of that, you are now behaving like a child concerning the fact that YOUR choice has consequences - and not just random ones, but absolutely consequences you'd know were coming, - such as him moving out - and you want him to compensate rent, so your consequences arent really going to fall entirely on yourself? YOU CHOSE THE DOG. You dont get to eat the cake and keep it too. Stop being ridiculous and grow up, especially if you want to make serious adult choices. Its not reasonable by any stretch of the imagination, that you not only get to renege on your relationship boundaries, but he has to grin and bear it, so you can afford the flat he is forced to move out of on top of losing his relationship in this manner...?\n\nYTA", "How can you even compare  goldfish with  dog? Slightly AH for that dumb comparison and for not being more understanding about your boyfriend's feelings. Other than that, there are no asholes, they just want different things and therefore are now incompatible. NAH.", "YTA. \n\n1. Did you even discuss it with your partner before making the decision to take the dog?\n\n2. a goldfish is not comparable to a fricken dog. seriously, do you think those two are anywhere near equal??", "NTA  about the dog but I think your relationship was on borrowed time from day one . If a goldfish caused a huge argument neither of you is mature enough to maintain a relationship", "YTA through and through.  A goldfish is not in the same ballpark as a dog.  Throwing away a great relationship with a human for a dog you haven't seen in 5 years i insane.  And Reddit's collective belief that dogs are better than people is dumb and weird.", "YTA. The only person that you're thinking of is yourself. That's not how a healthy relationship works. People talk to each other and communicate. Then they find a solution that everyone can live with. Not expect one party to abide by what the other wants just because they want to be selfish.\n\nAnd yes, there is a difference between a fish and a dog. Fish you can just feed once a day and change out the bowl/tank once a week. Other than that, no care required. Dogs need to be fed, walked, brushed, played with and watched constantly to make sure that they don't make a mess. Constant care is needed. BIG DIFFERENCE.", "This was his home too and You gave him the ultimatum of take in the dog or kick him out, knowing he didn\u2019t want a dog, idk what else you expected. YTA for that. Sounds like you got a dog and lost a boyfriend. I\u2019d suggest finding a roommate ASAP to cover rent, he\u2019s not going to pay rent when you\u2019ve asked him to leave and there\u2019s no reason he should. (This coming from a huge pet person who\u2019s 14 year old pup passed last weekend)\n\nAlso goldfish is nowhere near the same as a dog. They stay in a tank and require minimal caretaking with no sounds or messes to disturb you, as opposed to an aging dog.", "YTA and not for the dog issue, but for telling him to move out and thinking he would still help you with rent. I believe as soon as someone moves out/get told to move out you shouldn\u2019t expect them to help with any bills.", "Are you seriously comparing a dog to a goldfish? YTA over and over. \n\nWhat you claim to be your dog is not even yours. It\u2019s simply because nobody in your family can take care of it and you\u2019re helping. There\u2019s many different ways to go about. Family friends, friends, whatever. It\u2019s clearly your family that has issues. You shouldn\u2019t even have take it without your partner\u2019s consent. \n\nObviously 5 years relationship is not a big deal for you. I absolutely agree to him not contributing to rental and all. Until you open your eyes and see who is the one that has truly been staying by your side.", "Lol at you comparing a dog to a goldfish. YTA.", "Yes, YTA, and if you truly can't see the difference between a goldfish and a dog, I feel sorry for your bf. You agreed to no pets, and you know your bf doesn't like dogs. You can certainly take your dog back if that's what you want to do, but you have no reason to be upset with your bf for moving out and ending the relationship.", "If you wouldn't let him have a goldfish, then yeah, I think it's a bit hypocritical in your \"no pets\" rule to have a dog. A goldfish is basically no hassle for the person who isn't responsible for it (and less hassle than a dog even if you are responsible for it). There's no way to live in a house with the dog and not interact with the dog at all. If he hates dogs and you now have a dog, then yeah, you gotta break up.", "YTA", "This is a hard one. I would probably break up with someone who didn't want me to have my dog or suggested I take it to a shelter because It obviously means we're vastly different people. \n\nBut you did agree to no pets or children so I understand why he's annoyed, soft YTA.\n\nLife happens. Keep your dog. Break up with him.", "Yep.... YTA.\nIt was not your dog... it was your parents dog, remember?", "NAH, you just don't belong together. It happens, life goes on. He wanted to be pet free (or at least the animal he hates free), you agreed - so when one of you wants to break the arrangement, it's understandable for the other to decide to end the relationship. \n\n Just because you could tolerate a goldfish doesn't obligate him to agree to live with a dog. It's a completely different commitment, you realize. If you don't want to deal with the fish, you can completely ignore it and even not notice it, but that doesn't apply to a dog.", "YTA. You explicitly agreed and told him that you would be pet free. Then suddenly you change your mind with little to no notice. How hard was it for you to mention that dog to your partner? For 5 years you couldn't be bothered to tell him?\n\n>I told him that I'm not giving up my fur baby and he either needs to accept him or move out. \n\nYou basically kicked him out and is now surprised he doesn't want to pay for rent? Why should he pay for rent for a place he's been pretty much kicked out of? \n\n>I think this is justified, a couple of years ago he came home with a goldfish out of nowhere,\n\nA dog and a goldfish are very different. Did he kick you into because of a goldfish? I think not", "Let's reverse the scenario. He comes to you and says \"I found out that I have children and their mother is very sick and cannot continue to care for them\". What would be your response? If you would say that he handled it correctly by saying you can either deal with it or leave with zero discussion then you have your answer. Something tells me that you would do the exact thing he is doing. You had an agreement; child and pet free. I think he made the correct decision and I believe he dodged a bullet if you are willing to so easily throw away a 5 year relationship. Also, you can't have it all. You are free to make your decision, but so is he. \n\nYTAH", "NAH. You both apparently just don't care for each other that much. It's okay. Move your separate ways.", "YTA\nWell, you changed, he didn't. You should move out to care for your dog if that's your choice. Why do you expect him to leave and still pay rent?", "Yta I really hope your boyfriend leaves you, because you obviously don't have enough respect for him, it was an agreement, as many people have said a goldfish isn't comparable to a dog, hope you enjoy being single op", "You both agreed a rule and you\u2019re mad you broke it. A fish is a massive difference to a dog. Your partner has a right to be pissed! I would be. See sense and be mad at your parents for being hypocritical and abandoning their pet. I bet he is enjoying the quiet at his mates, yeah YTA big time here. In every way.", "YTA, goldfish is not the same as a dog - and you know that. \n\nTotally get why you would take the dog in, but your still the asshole", "NAH. \n\nYour partner never wanted a dog, so he is free to move out. If a dog moves in sind you have to pay the rent alone. You can't expect him to pay rent if you basically have thrown him out. \n\nI totally understand why you took in the dog, but there were hard boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Animals are euthanized all the time here.  Most shelters kill them after a specified time if there is no one to step up and adopt the dog.", "\u201cSo what\u201d is a response that make sense coming from a random redditor. Not from OP\u2019s partner.", "Fortunately (or unfortunately, however, you choose to look at it), I am the only reason my husband sees the doctor for any reason at all. I don't expect him to ignore his health. He was free to leave if he wanted to, and I wouldn't have faulted him at all. Maybe your partner just didn't care about you because my husband has to deal with none of that. That sounds absolutely dreadful, and I'm sorry you had to endure such a severe reaction. You must have really cared to put yourself through that, but im glad you chose yourself in the end.", "Yeah, a fish is more of a decoration than pet- very little work or attention needed.  A dog needs food, vet trips, lots of attention, has to be cleaned up after and provides love and companionship, \na fish takes very little work (but can be expensive) and never leaves the aquarium. But what do I know- I love animals and have always wanted children so I REALLY don't understand people with this attitude.", "Tell me you don't understand what I'm saying without telling me.  \n\n\nThe both broke the agreement. He did it first with goldfish. Goldfish is a pet and their agreement was being pet free. End of story.  \n\n\nI dunno how to explain that in simpler terms.", "The issue about the goldfish was a complete lack of communication, he didn't need to bring home the fish \n\n\nIf it was literally life or death for the fish it would have been completely different", "To each their own. But pushing a dog onto someone that doesn't want that is even dumber. And them acting all pikachu face why they moved out and don't pay rent?", ">Some wizard worked their magic to grow those suckers\n\nThank you. I do try.", "They are? How is the boyfriend \"going nuclear\" for movig out when told to move out?", "A goldfish is barely a pet. It's a hobby and a decoration", "I just explained to you why it wasn\u2019t just an agreement but also a boundary. It\u2019s his home and personal space and that space got invaded against his will. Imagine if she just decided to let her family live in their shared home against his will. It\u2019s absolutely crossing a boundary and if it\u2019s important enough for him to leave his home, it\u2019s obviously a big deal to him.\n\nLegally, he probably needs to pay but morally I absolutely think he\u2019s correct when he\u2019s not paying. She basically forced him out so she should take responsibility and pay full rent. Like you said, she should have been the one to leave. Not him.", "The boundary of entering the apartment door.", "that he is also an asshole doesnt mean she isnt YTA", "Yeah I agree that that was stupid as he also broke that agreement. Still, a goldfish would not impact OPs life very much, a dog on the contrary would impact his. But other than that yes, I totally agree that his action was stupid.", "The issue is that you took the dog in your shared appartment. That\u2019s what makes you the asshole here. If your partner was against getting the dog, you should have moved out and then taken the dog. Instead you forced your partner out. It\u2019s just shitty behaviour", "Yeah, but by the time you met him, you made agreement with him, all those five years you spent him, that dog is essentially \u2018not\u2019 your dog. If it did, you should have said since start that you indeed have a dog, just not physically with you. You then should not make the pet free agreement. Pet is a big deal, yet you brush it apart when you got with your partner.", "That should tell you all you need to know. He\u2019s not a keeper. Don\u2019t waste any more of your time on this person. He doesn\u2019t hold you close to his heart.", "The dog deserves to live out the rest of his days with family he knows and loves.  If fiance can't handle a change of plans for a couple years knowing how important the dog is to you, then screw him. You did plan for this unlikely situation and it would probably be detrimental to your mental health and would build resentment for your fiance anyway, should you get rid of the dog.  If you went and adopted some dog then you'd be a huge AH.", "I agree but she knew her partner didn't want pets, and had a particular aversion to dogs. Her partner leaving is a consequence she has to accept if she wants to keep the dog.", "No kill shelters are a thing eh. Nobody said she even has to give it away. But yes it will\nComport ending her relationship. It\u2019s ok eh. To begin with their choice to not have pets stems from different things. One was a trauma that can be healed and eventually she can even wants more dogs. He hates them not gona change.", "I think that is a bit reductive and dismissive, but I appreciate the last sentiment and wish you all the best to your husband.", "obviously, the care needed for fish is in no way comparable to a dogs, but id like to add that especially goldfish require a lot of care! they get huge  (theoretically up to 16 inches) and you need more frequent water changes as they produce a looot more waste than the average fish.", "Everyone gets that. They're saying it was broken to different degrees. Like how if you break the speed limit by a few km/hr or by 30. The latter is generally considered much worse", "In simpler terms, the goldfish never poops or pees in the living room, barks at anything, chews on furniture or slippers, hops on your bed, sheds all over the house, or licks you. Both are violations of the agreement, but the two situations are not even vaguely comparable. Goldfish in a bowl are a technical violation of the agreement. A dog is an obvious, in your face, blatant violation of the agreement. \n\nMost landlords would overlook goldfish as a violation of a no pet clause. They would definitely not overlook the presence of a dog. As a landlord, I have had  to replace doors chewed up by dogs. I have never had to repair damage done by goldfish.\n\nSometimes, you need to look beyond technicalities and focus on the practical impact of things.", "By not even willing to discuss how to handle the situation...", "It's still a PET!  \n\n\nBut good on you... Happy to see that you wouldn't be able to keep an agreement.", ">It\u2019s his home and personal space and that space got invaded against his will.\n\nIt's hers too. That's why it makes it complicated. Their boundaries around their home cancel out basically. So it's the agreement that they made that is what was actually broken. Semantics maybe, but I feel like it's an important distinction. \n\n>Legally, he probably needs to pay but morally I absolutely think he\u2019s correct when he\u2019s not paying.\n\nI agree with that, but it could fuck up his credit or she could use it against him. He needs to break the lease ASAP if he's on it. If he isn't, we'll then absolutely he shouldn't pay and instead look for a place to rent in his own or with a friend.", "I see your point but OP's bf broke the agreement once too, and OP accepted it. In bfs case it was him randomly bringing goldfish, this is her taking in a dog she owned before and lost and would be on the streets if she didn't take her in.", "Did you miss the part of where she got therapy for it. No matter what, the partner is hopefully aware of her very real issues that resulted from her parents denying her her dog that she went to therapy for.", "Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Thank you for the well wishes, and I wish you the same.", "Agreements are usually not speed limits though. Agreements about relationship are matter of trust and they should be honored from both sides. Their agreement was to be PET free. Goldfish is PET. Dog is a PET. They didn't have agreement to be DOG free but PET free.  \n\n\nHe didn't honor his side so saying he is not TA is just dumb and OP can feel justified in not honoring the boundary because she kept it for years. He didn't.  \n\n\nThe situation would be different if he never broke the agreement and she brought in the dog, however that is not the case.", "Agreements and boundaries should be still fully honored by both sides and if one side is not happy with the agreement then again both sides needs to agree on changing that.  \n\n\nHe broke her trust and the agreement first. They are both Assholes that failed to communicate properly but still excusing him for breaking agreement because it was smaller offense is BS.   \n\n\nI might get downvoted to hell but it is what it is. At least I can see how many people see no issue in breaking agreements.", "Goldfish require a regularly cleaned tank that grows as they grow, food, heat, water treatments. It's not 'just a goldfish' there a commitment to the care of the fish same as the dog. It may not be as demanding as the dog but don't act like a fish is that easy to care for. I had a fish for 5 years as a teenager, probably would still have it if I could've gotten it a bigger tank. Beyond that as everyone keeps repeating the agreement was no PETS. Not no dogs but a goldfish is ok", "Boyfriend did discuss, prior to getting the dog. He clearly said he wasn't up for getting the dog. What would compromise look like here, it's a binary choice, one of them would clearly be unhappy. \n\nPlus, *OP told him to move out*. After that, what was there to talk about?", "No it doesn\u2019t cancel out at all. And it\u2019s not complicated. No idea how you got to that conclusion, she brought a third party into their arrangement. You\u2019re using mental gymnastics to justify it.\n\nEdit: I hate when people delete their comments when they look stupid. Cowards", "A dog is a lot more work and hassle then a goldfish", "The goldfish thing reads like satire. It\u2019s literally decoration lmao. As if a little goldfish bowl that\u2019s just sitting in a corner is comparable to a dog", "He is fully aware of my dog and my feelings for him, we had discussed our past", "A third party would be a human being.  Not a pet.", "It's really not. Goldfish are a lot of labor.", "Yeah that's why I think why this is a sucky situation for him either I think you are not an AH for wanting to take care of your dog."]}
