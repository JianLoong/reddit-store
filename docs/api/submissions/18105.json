During these trying times, I really need my wife to step it up and support me, and she's doing a marvelous job of it.\n\nBut she booked a flight back home through our joint account, which I contribute the bulk of the money to,  because apparently her friend is going through something. When I told her that I can barely handle work as it is, and I'm in no shape to take care of the kids and do household work she didn't listen to me and waved off my concerns. I found her nonchalant attitude to be rather disrespectful, so I cancelled her flight, but now she's calling me controlling even though she booked it with my money.\n\nI was just doing what was best for the family, and in tough times, everyone needs to play their part, but she doesn't see it that way, and is now giving me the silent treatment.", "created_utc": 1684946674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qqqlh/aita_for_cancelling_my_wifes_ticket/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And money isn\u2019t everything. \n\nBuy her flowers, apologize for being a dick in response/retaliation to feeling like you weren\u2019t heard & were dismissed then sit down and work TOGETHER to hire a temporary nanny & a maid to take over the housework and child care while she\u2019s gone. Then repurchase the tickets. \n\nYou took 10 minutes to make those kids, she spends her lifetime with the bulk of the responsibilities of raising them because you feel it\u2019s her duty and she owes you for making more money than her.

If your wife teaches and looks after the children, plus does virtually all the housework, she works much longer than your 60 hours. You say that you split chores accordingly, but that tells me you do very little because you think she has sooo much free time on her hands. \n\nI will not even respond to the part about her booking with \"your\" money because that line gets me too upset and I would be permanently kicked off this site for saying what I think of you. \n\nI congratulate your wife on her self control in giving you the silent treatment.

So, you have a high demand, high paying job. She has a high demand, underpaid job and it sounds like she takes on more of the household duties and childraising? Count your blessings and don't make your wife question this.

I usually tend to work an average of 60 hours a week, while my wife(33F) is a teacher. As such, she has more free time than me so we split housework and domestic chores accordingly.\n\nRecently, I've been engaged in a very huge project at work that's consuming all my time and energy, so I've been taking a backseat to domestic duties. During these trying times, I really need my wife to step it up and support me, and she's doing a marvelous job of it.\n\nBut she booked a flight back home through our joint account, which I contribute the bulk of the money to,  because apparently her friend is going through something. When I told her that I can barely handle work as it is, and I'm in no shape to take care of the kids and do household work she didn't listen to me and waved off my concerns. I found her nonchalant attitude to be rather disrespectful, so I cancelled her flight, but now she's calling me controlling even though she booked it with my money.\n\nI was just doing what was best for the family, and in tough times, everyone needs to play their part, but she doesn't see it that way, and is now giving me the silent treatment.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(She didn't steal from a private account) YOU decided you didn't want her to go so YOU controlled her like a child. \n\nYou both seem to have communication issues. Sit down. Talk. Find someone to help. Whatever. But making a unilateral decision based on what \"YOU THINK IS BEST\" is what a parent does, not a partner.", "ESH. You guys need to communicate better.\n\nDo you feel like the money is yours? You should tell her.

You are under a lot of stress at work and you do not see a a way to manage the household without her. She should not decide this without you.\n\nYou are PARTNERS. Not master and servant. \n\nYou must both decide on how to make this work. Perhaps you have some family that can come stay with you and manage the kids? Perhaps you can hire a babysitter, a cook and a cleaner, just for this time? Perhaps you can scale down your hours at work? Perhaps she can postpone the trip or make it shorter?

Your wife sounds overwhelmed right now with all the stuff you expect her to take on on top of her job. I'm just betting you come home and expect her to have played out the kids, immaculately cleaned the house, and prepared a nice home-cooked meal from scratch after putting in her own work day. I could almost bet she needs to work at night to keep up with lesson planning etc. She needs a break. And you need to find a solution together, not a cancelling a plane ticket power play.\n\n4. Who forces you to work that much anyway? You have a wife, you have kids. Work is important, but so is your family.

It doesn't sound like love at all\n\nYTA and you sound like a very unpleasant person", "You\u2019re the AH for using the term high value.\n\nYou being lucky to have her has nothing to do with being \u201chigh value\u201d.\u2018 It\u2019s about her value in your life. She seemingly does all the housework, all the child raising, manages the home in every way, all while working her own demanding job, so you can work your high powered job. That\u2019s why you\u2019re lucky.", "You\u2019re arrogant as hell OP. You don\u2019t appreciate your wife and you\u2019re definitely TA", "I mean, you can't even deal with the thought of her leaving for a trip? She's certainly more valuable in this relationship. She'll be fine without, whereas it seems like you can barely function without her. You're a wreck of a husband/father and it's so sad you don't see that.", "Wow, your comments alone make YTA, but then with the obvious misogyny and financial abuse of your wife - well, now that puts you in a special category of \u201cyou\u2019re the monster and celebrates about how terrible you are\u201d. You didn\u2019t come here for a judgement, you want an echo chamber so you can continue to abuse your wife and justify it.", "I don\u2019t even know you and I\u2019d like to divorce you.

That\u2019s how you talk about an annoying coworker, not your wife and mother of your children.  Prepare yourself to be giving away a lot more of your money in child support and alimony because she\u2019s not going to put up with your shit forever.  And you\u2019re very wrong.  You\u2019re lucky to have her, NOT the other way around.  You sound like a horrible partner.", "Either way results in the kids not being looked after, which is my entire point.", "I already said he is the main AH, idk why you're arguing as if I didn't.\n\nMy point was literally just your last sentence - she should have taken the kids. Leaving the kids in those circumstances when she knows he cant/won't look after them probably is AH behaviour towards the kids.", "There are so many more hours that go into teaching than our contract stipulates. I guarantee the poor woman works just as much as he does and then has all the household responsibilities and disrespect on top of it from her partner.

Also, OP, YTA.", "Not while she's going away for one month, she's not at work. And I guess the hours of work are different if she is more at home. You don't have the right to totally ditch your family for a whole month just because you also had to work fulltume and take on most housework for some time. Op has equally helped in the past, and now he temporally can't do so because of a challenging project. That's what happens in a marriage. You take over when the other can't.\nI repeat, a whole month is an absurd amount of time to leave your family without even talking about it with your husband beforehand. If the roles were reversed, you'd be calling the husband a piece of sht. Don't talk to me about defending misogynists.\n\nAnd don't speculate on what they probably have.

Marriage is about doing everything 50/50 and treating each other with respect.
