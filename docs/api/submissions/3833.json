I guess all this has made me a little sensitive about my looks, so, put simply, his gif hurt my feelings.\n\nIn retaliation I decided to go onto our county website and pull up a mugshot from about a year ago when he got a DWI, testing over twice the legal limit. He was struggling with alcoholism at the time, and he ended up being sent to treatment by our employer. He's done well since. But I posted the mugshot in reply to his photo and captioned it \"Still not as bad as this one, though.\"\n\nHe PM'ed me shortly after and basically said that this was a low-blow and disproportionate; that he was just giving me a hard time but that I'd gotten way too personal. I responded that his gif was personal and that he shouldn't dish it out if he can't take it. I've since deleted both his gif comment and my reply because I think it all got a little out of hand.

You\u2019re feeling hurt and sensitive for many valid reasons, but I doubt he knew any of your pain\u2014 unless you\u2019re closer than you told us. You posted his darkest moment online because of your own personal insecurity.
