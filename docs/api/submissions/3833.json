Most of it is good-natured and I usually enjoy it. But this one kind of hit a nerve. I'm fairly recently divorced and my ex admitted that one of her reasons for leaving the marriage was that she just didn't feel any physical attraction to me. I've tried to get back out into the dating market but so far I haven't really had any success. I used to be pretty athletic but following a knee injury I've had trouble working out and have put on a few pounds. Also I'm getting a bald spot. I guess all this has made me a little sensitive about my looks, so, put simply, his gif hurt my feelings.\n\nIn retaliation I decided to go onto our county website and pull up a mugshot from about a year ago when he got a DWI, testing over twice the legal limit. He was struggling with alcoholism at the time, and he ended up being sent to treatment by our employer. He's done well since. But I posted the mugshot in reply to his photo and captioned it \"Still not as bad as this one, though.\"\n\nHe PM'ed me shortly after and basically said that this was a low-blow and disproportionate; that he was just giving me a hard time but that I'd gotten way too personal. I responded that his gif was personal and that he shouldn't dish it out if he can't take it. I've since deleted both his gif comment and my reply because I think it all got a little out of hand.

You\u2019re feeling hurt and sensitive for many valid reasons, but I doubt he knew any of your pain\u2014 unless you\u2019re closer than you told us. You posted his darkest moment online because of your own personal insecurity. Overcoming alcoholism, an arrest and all the shame that comes with it is so challenging, and his past should not have been brought up in this petty manner. I think another person said you brought a nuclear warhead to a knife fight, and this metaphor is apt.

His comment was mean as hell but, I agree with him, your reaction was disproportionate to what he did. Maybe you and your coworkers should reexamine these \"playful digs\" you make towards one another and, the culture it's potentially fostered."]}
