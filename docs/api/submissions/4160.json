Trash (not recycling) is put in my restricted recycling bin and my regular bin.  \n\nDuring the first few years after I moved in, I would move the trash to their bins.  When I had to do this all the time, I started leaving it outside their bins on the ground.  Then after more years, I started leaving it outside their gate.  Now I deliver it to their door.  I also lock my bins behind a gate, so the only period of opportunity to \"mistake\" my bins located across the alley for their bins that are located behind their apartment is a few hours.  \n\nI found a strong message from the beginning is the way to go.

I'm waiting for an update during next week's bin service to see if they try it again.  The problem with you not doing anything is they will continue to do that and other things.

They should have asked before putting stuff in your bin. Especially if they put enough to fill the whole bin before you put in the last of your trash and wheeled it out.

No one in my building has been able to throw any garbage away for a whole week now. \n\nPeople who feel entitled to use other people's stuff are also often the type people who will take a mile if you give them an inch, so it's good that you made it clear right away that they aren't to be using your bin.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA, they knew it wasn\u2019t there bin to use and they shouldn\u2019t have used. Maybe you could have left it by the bin and left a note to only use their own bin going forward. People these days feel so entitled.", "Yes, I'm in Australia like OP and I thought this was the etiquette - you only add to someone else's bin if they have finished filling it, ie it's out for collection and close to collection time. I mean yes you could ask, but where I live in Sydney this is what is normal.", "It's their property and they never asked to use his bins to dispose of it. He just returned the property to its rightful owner.", "I am also Australian haha. Yeah, this definitely seems to be the etiquette.

You need to get yourself a pet. Not a wimpy one like a crocodile, I mean a hard-core pet like a Huntsman. Take that baby with you everywhere from now on. Make sure it's trained; you want it to think you're the alpha spider and it has to obey you. Once the neighbours see you out and about walking your Huntsman, and especially once they see the way you can control it, they'll back off. They'll probably assume you belong to one of those rebel  outlaw spider groups like the Redbacks or the Funnel Webs and they will know not to mess with you.", "Jesus you sound like a doormat. Reading your comments is annoying me. Being assertive and setting boundaries is not confrontational.

My next door neighbors always have so much trash on the curb every trash day. I\u2019m talking both trash and recycle cans are so full the lids just stay flipped open because it\u2019s impossible to use. They also throw out bulk items like outdoor furniture and carpet. When we put our trash cans on the curb, but left them empty because we honestly got sidetracked and forgot to take the trash out,  we went out later in the night and found out that they filled up all three of our trash cans with all of their stuff. This is where my pettiness came in. I wanted to take all of their trash and dump it on the front lawn but I didn\u2019t because my mom wouldn\u2019t let me. I\u2019ve also noticed recently that they\u2019ve stolen trash cans from other neighbors and they still leave a mess in the front yard every trash day. \n\nMy mom told me that it\u2019s illegal to put trash in other peoples trash cans because you have to pay for the trash, cans and the service. And putting your trash into somebody else\u2019s trashcan because it is private property.", "You were not being unreasonable.  Unreasonable would be dumping it on their walkway, or their car.  Knocking on their door and handing it to them. Tying it to a brick and throwing it through the front window would also be unreasonable.\nNTA", "Tell them it's illegal if they put their trash in your bin. Tell them they are breaking a law. It depends one where u live, most places its illegal to use someone else's trash", "NTA. I had a neighbor that did this. Her trash would be full, so they'd toss their trash in our bin, to the point we couldn't fit ours in. The last time they did it,I was trying to pack their trash down to put one of my bags in and cut my hand on broken glass in one of their bags. I came completely unglued and started tossing their bags in their yard. They came home and I heard her start freaking out, so I stepped out onto my front steps, crossed my arms and just stared at her. I'm a big dude, and I have no problem looking mean.

Better to nip that behavior in the bud now.", "NTA\n\nEven if your can was on the curb already, it is still rude to do that without asking", "NTA. Sorry for your new shit Neighbors", "Do you have the same neighbors as me?  I've had this issue for a couple of years.  I finally had to call the city and report them when they filled my entire bin with yard waste which the city will not pick up.  I was actually having to store my own rubbish in my garage because they kept overfilling my bins.  And, yes, I knew who was doing it.

Set boundaries early!", "My kids deliver junk mail, and we often have a lot left over.  We put it in the recycling bin, but often can't put it all in there because of weight.  I have a standing arrangement with a neighbour that I can put some leftovers in his recycling bin.  He has told me many times to just put it in whenever I want, but I won't do it until it's actual recycling day and his bin is at the curb.

We also have green bins here for garden rubbish, and we were doing a huge garden tidy up.  We'd filled our bin to the weight limit.  We have a bin reciprocation deal with a neighbour, so after checking that he wasn't using it that week, we put some in his.  We still had more to go, and I know another neighbour almost never uses her green bin as she doesn't have much garden.  I STILL texted her to ask if it was ok, especially since I needed to do it before bin day.  We kept it for a couple of days, and when bin day came, we wheeled it to her curb.", "\ud83c\udfafThis is perfection."]}
