I don\u2019t know how true this is, but we were told we would likely never see them again if we didn\u2019t take them in.\n\nIt was hard. I don\u2019t regret a bit of it but we had to change many things. We\u2019re definitely losing money a lot faster now too and sadly, we even had to give my dog away because the 4 year old is terrified of dogs and was having panic attacks every time he saw her. \n\nMy mom was horrified. She hates that I had to sacrifice so much even though I never signed up for it which I suppose I understand. She mostly despises the fact that I gave our dog away. I get that too. I was so heartbroken over it (I cried) but unlike what most people think, the constant exposure was making the 4 year old worse. Not even therapy was helping because he was so overwhelmed already. \n\nMy mom thinks I did a cruel thing and says my priority was the dog. I feel guilty. But I\u2019m so busy with the kids and I kind of have bigger things to worry about, insensitive as it sounds. I know my dog\u2019s safe with loving owners, and I\u2019ve moved on. \n\nI was having a really tough day yesterday. My boss is being harder on me ever since I took a break to focus on the kids so I had to deal with that, my husband\u2019s working overtime and the kids were having a bad day and were sobbing over everything. The older one refused to eat, and even threw a bunch of my things on the floor. My mom then dropped by for a quick visit. \n\nI was already on edge so when my mom barged in talking about how she can\u2019t stop thinking of \u201cher\u201d I was so lost.

Why didn't mom step up to the plate and volunteer to take the dog in? Otherwise, she can STFU.  I think we know who is TA in this scenario...\n\nAlso bravo for taking in your husband's sibs.  That is a selfless act that deserves praise, not a guilt trip.  Giving them a loving home instead of foster care might just save them from a terrible life.    \nAre there any social service agencies in the area that could help you out? You are saving the state big bucks by taking the boys in, there might be some subsidies to assist you with food etc.", "Nta at all. \n\nI bet if you\u2019d asked your mother to take the dog she would have said no. That\u2019s what happened to me, I needed to rehome my dog and I told everyone about it and struggled for months finding one and when he was finally gone they tried to come for me?? My sole argument is always \u201cyou should have taken him then\u201d", "NTA. You make a heartbreaking sacrifice and your mother is being cruel for punishing you. Why could she not have taken the dog if it meant so much to her?\n\nAt the end of the day, we need to support our children. You are supporting your inherited children, your mother needs to support hers.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your mom is on one about the dog.\n\nUnfortunately people have to give up pets all the time when they have children. Some pets are a legitimate danger to children. It is sad, but it is not like it is uncommon.\n\nMy neighbors directly across the street literally had to do the same thing. They had a dog for a few years before they had child. The dog kept growling at and acting aggressively towards the baby. Their only choice was to give the dog away.\n\nAnd it is not like it wasn't the well-behaved dog. It was very well trained. It walked on a leash. It sat and laid down when you told it to. It was loving and affectionate. It just got weirdly territorial about having to share the house with baby.", "NTA if mom is so heartbroken why didn't she take in the dog?\n\nYou rehomed her. You did right by the dog and are doing right by your nephews.\n\nShe wants the dog back she can go get her or take the kids so you can keep the dog.", "NTA. Of course giving away your dog when you live with a child with allergies is the right thing to do. In fact, it\u2019s the only decent choice, as hard as it is. Sorry, but I think your mom is actually being really immature", "NTA.\n\nYou're making big choices in a big mess (no offense), and we can tell that you're only doing what you need to. It's not like you've gone and put the dog down with a rifle, it's gone somewhere else. I think your mother needs to feel some sympathy for what you're going through.\nI hope everything goes well.", "NTA - You're trying to do the right thing by taking care of two kids who'd otherwise be in foster care. You're obviously trying to do right by them and if one of them is terrified of your dog, you made the right choice to let other loving dog owners take her instead.\n\nYou didn't just dump her at an animal shelter, you found loving owners for her. Your mom does not dictate what you do with your dog and is being very unsupportive in a time where you really don't need her kind of negativity. \n\nMy advice would be to make it very clear to your mom that the kids are your priority and to stop bringing up the dog. She's with loving owners and she's been taken care of. If she cannot understand that or let it go; there's the door and don't let it hit you on the way out.\n\nI'm proud of you and your husband that you made this really difficult choice to take care of these kids. You're doing right by them.", "NTA - Who the hell gives people crap for prioritizing a child over a pet? Having to re-home your pet is a very hard decision to make, and you obviously didn't make it lightly. But your mom... does she even acknowledge that there are children in the equation? Does your mom think that, since they're your husband's siblings, she doesn't have to think about them? She sounds like a monster.\n\nAnd if she was so in love with your dog, why didn't she re-arrange her whole life to keep it around?", "NTA, but your mom is seriously unhinged! I would have lost my mind on her, and you managed to stay relatively composed??  How are you even asking if you're the AH??  Your mom shouldn't be coming into your house and causing insane drama for attention, like you said: you have bigger things to worry about! \n\nSometimes you do have to give up your dog for reasons beyond your control.  It sounds like you tried therapy with your little one before rehoming your dog and it wasn't working and you didn't want them to live in terror anymore.  It's not good for your dog to be around someone who is that terrified.  You did your best for the kiddo and for your dog and that's all you can do.\n\nYou're doing your best to parent these children with really complex issues and that's amazing!  It sounds like you're doing a great job and trying to give them a positive home environment.", "NTA, You unexpected became a mother of two and had to give your dog to another family. You said it yourself, she's with loving owners. It's not like you kicked her out and let her become a stray. She's being taken care of and you're still adjusting to your new situation.", "If she cares so much about the dog why didn\u2019t she offer to adopt her? NTA", "NTA. I'm a crazy animal lover, and normally, I'd be horrified if someone just dumped off their dog...**BUT**,  obviously there are some life circumstances that are beyond our control. Your priority should be your kids. You are doing a very kind thing by keeping them with family and out of foster care. I'm so sorry your dog wasn't able to fit into that situation,  but if you have to choose between who goes into foster care- the dog or your toddler brothers- the choice is evident. Your mom sounds... interesting.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThis sounds incredibly tough, but also like you didn't have any other choice, and that you made sure the animal was well taken care of. Forgetting who your mother was talking about in a busy moment is entirely understandable, and making that out to be a big deal is incredibly unkind of your mom.   \n\n\nI'm sorry you're having such a rough time. Hang in there!", "NTA - Everyone is simply overwhelmed right now. You and your husband suddenly became parents which was not something either of you planned for. \n\nYour husband is working overtime to compensate for the additional costs of 2 kids. You are learning to become a mother to young children and juggling a job. And the kids are young, confused and lashing out in fear at the newess of their lives. It\u2019s simply overwhelming for all parties. \n\nYour mother is also overwhelmed and probably wants your life to return to the old one. Your dog, which both of you loved, was part of your former life. Right now is extremely emotional time for everyone. A dog who terrified the 4 year old was just one stressor your new family did not need. \n\nI love my pets and spend more time with them than people. I cannot imagine my life without them. So I can sympathize with you re-homing your dog and your mother\u2019s frustration. I can tell you truly loved your pet. \n\nBut life changes in unexpected ways and your new family\u2019s priority now is those two young children. Hang in there while there are \u201cgrowing pains\u201d in this situation. You and your husband are doing a wonderful, admirable thing. Good luck & best wishes to you both.", "NTA - by a long shot!\nYou had no choice but to prioritize the kids.  Your mom sounds... special...", "NAH. You're dealing with a lot and prioritizing your family's needs. It's not forgetting, it's focusing. Your mom is also upset, which is understandable. It's a tough situation; communication and understanding are key.", "NTA.  \nIt sounds like you made an effort to make the dog stay, it just didn't work. What were you supposed to do? Move out? Divorce your husband because the child was an issue and you wanted the dog more than him and the family?  \nI love animals and I hate seeing pets getting rehomed. But that is only those times when people don't try, and the \"animal is just a nuisance\" to them. You tried. It just didn't work.   \nYou made sure YOUR DOG came to a home with loving owners, and I am sure the dog is happy there now.   \nIt was not your mothers dog, and since she keeps guilt tripping you, I'd definitely put her in her place.  You didn't forget the dog, but does the wound need to be reopened EVERY TIME you see your mom? No. Life happens and you try to deal with it the best you can.  \nYour mom is a huge AH though.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I was prepared to find you the AH. But your circumstances warranted it, plus kudos to you for making the effort to find the dog a good home.\n\nPart of the situation missed here is that the dog was also likely stressed by the changes and the new emotional set up in the house, so with others is better for the dog as well.", "NTA\n\nYour mum is though for making an already extremely tough period of your life even harder. \n\nShe may not like that you have become parents in this way but honestly, when you get married, you become a unit and at a unit you and your husband made a decision to take in his younger brothers. That was no doubt a really hard decision and an incredibly big adjustment to make, so kudos to you both for doing that.\n\nMum misses the dog, does she really think you don't miss your own dog even more? And that it was anything other than heartbreaking for your to give up your beloved pet?\n\nBut who puts their dog above two young children in desperate need? Don't answer me, I know that some people would but you are NTA for putting thise kids first.\n\nShe may be grieving for the life she imagined you having but honestly, her behaviour is still appalling.", "NTA. Your mom needs to stop hassling you. Something is seriously wrong with her thought process and she is definitely the asshole here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While we did it for the boys, it was also for selfish reasons. We love them too much to never see them again. I\u2019m not even related to them by blood but the thought of not having those two in my life\u2026 I can\u2019t even put into words. \n\nWe get some benefits but we haven\u2019t explored all our options yet so will definitely still be looking into stuff.

There's some other issue that's really upsetting mom, and it's not the dog. Does she fear that after adopting two young kids, the OP won't produce 'real' grandchildren for grandma?

Set a boundary and decide how you\u2019re going to handle it. \n\nYour mom watched you clean up glass and care for the kids and was still focused on yelling at you. That\u2019s bananas.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is being cruel. You were put in an impossible situation and had to make a hard choice. Constantly berating you and bringing it front of mine is simply mean. \n\nDid she ever offer to take the dog in?", "NTA, you've done a wonderful thing for these children, and you made sure your dog went to someone who would love and care for her...\n\nYour mom is being unreasonable.

I'm sure things will get better.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you had to give up your dog, first of all. You had to make a choice that I definitely do not envy. You absolutely made the right choice but that doesn\u2019t make the situation any less devastating.\n\nYour entire life has been turned upside down and it is monstrous that your mom is adding more emotional turmoil to the situation. She should be supporting you, not guilting you.\n\nMany, many internet hugs to you. I hope you have some wonderful people in your corner to help you through this enormous change.", "NTA. This must have been an extremely difficult decision. If you mother was so worried about the dog, why didn't she take her in?", "Even when it's not a safe environment anymore?

Children need more than dogs do and the result of them not getting it is much longer reaching than for dogs.

The fact that you know your dog is in a good and loving home, shows that you took the care to make sure she was taken care of.

Your mother is being extremely unreasonable in this situation, and you haven't really forgotten about your dog, you're just so busy that you really don't have time to dwell on it, plus you already know where the dog is.

I love DOOOOOOG!\u201d\n\nLike that\u2019s a fucking BIZARRE thing to do.  \n\nYou had three wailing, unmanageable toddlers in your home right then. \n\nShe really wanted you to stop being a parent, and cry with her about about how much you miss a dog, *in front of your kids*.\n\nYou didn\u2019t choose to surrender your dog because it was inconvenient. You had to choose between your (traumatized) nephews and your dog. I doubt surrendering the dog was ever the plan, but in the end, the dog had a home she could go to. The children didn\u2019t.\n\nYour mom needling you to turn children you love over to foster care so she can enjoy the idea of you having a dog is batshit.\n\n\u201cMom, these kids, for the foreseeable future, are my children.

I personally experienced it when I fostered a cat I was told got so frustrated being kenneled that she\u2019d bite as soon as she was let out and then get stuck back in the kennel in a cycle. So they sent her to me so she wouldn\u2019t have to be kenneled. Well it wasn\u2019t the kennel. I couldn\u2019t close my eyes or lower my guard at any time or there\u2019s be blood. She would bite when happy, when just sitting next to me, when playing. I figured out it was an excess energy thing + habits and even having her run around after toys for an hour plus wasn\u2019t enough to tire her out since I was at work during the day. \n\nWhen I told the rescue it wasn\u2019t working because of the mismatch in cat energy/play time and her beginning to go for my face, I lost a friend and a few others turned their noses up at me for months. Giving up on a cat was unacceptable to them no matter what. The cat in question ended up with a family of 4 older kids in a giant house (vs me alone in a condo) and they were thrilled with her! But it didn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d rehomed a foster before she could be adopted and to them it was unforgivable. \n\nNTA under the circumstances.

Humans are more important than pets. You obviously loved your dog, you found a better situation for her than the one where she lived in a house with a terrified child.

Your mom needs to get a grip on reality or quit coming over and making your life harder.", "NTA.  Why didn't your mom take the dog if she's so worried about it.", "NTA it wasn't like you dropped her off at a gas station - you found a good home for your dog. A friend of mines husband passed, he was retired and spent all day with the dog. She works crazy hours (RN) and found a home for the dog with a retired couple. She said the dog went from being played with all day to being crated - it wasn't because she didn't love the dog, it was because she did love him.

You were responsible and caring in your decisions.\n\nI think you might need to start implementing some hard boundaries with your mother.

Raising kids is a day by day thing.  Everyone just does the best they can.  Good Luck", "I stopped after a few paragraphs in. You\u2019re not an asshole for doing right by those children. Yes of course when you get a dog you\u2019re supposed to take care of it for the rest of their life and it\u2019s cruel to rehome. You didn\u2019t rehome him because of a new boyfriend or because of some petty reason. You are trying to cultivate an environment that is safe for a living breathing child. Children will always come over animals. I hate to say it but it\u2019s true especially when it comes to physical and mental well-being. What you had to do was hard and I know you didn\u2019t wanna do it. And it makes it even harder having other people shit on you for it. But I promise you that you did the right thing", "Your mother is the A.\n\nAs a person who aged out of foster care and who has fostered and adopted, let me tell you something. You're right. You would have zero legal rights to these children if they went into foster care. Placing siblings together is hard and sometimes these jackass States separate siblings on purpose if they are too (dependant) on each other. People want to adopt babies. They rarely adopt siblings. The one having the issues would not be adopted and would probably spend his childhood in the \"system\". Foster care is to be avoided like the plague if at all possible.\n\nPlease tell your mother that she can kindly stop coming over. If she needs counseling for grief over the dog, she should get it.\n\nYou made a very hard and loving choice.\n\nAs someone who adopted three siblings...please know, you're a hero.\n\nIf the adoption process is not finished, you can see if you qualify for any financial help. Many states place children with families because then they don't have to help with finances. Some states do help. I don't know what state you're in. They can help with medical insurance, counseling and SNAP to help you get food. It's not charity. This is help for your children.\n\nYour mother needs to stay away. She's toxic.\n\nI'm sorry about your dog. She is loved and safe.", "NTA. I am an animal person. I'd probably say my best friend was my cat lol. BUT you had to do what you had to do and I don't think you could have done anything better. You took in kids who needed you and you found a loving home for your dog. I don't know what else you could have done in this situation. It must have been stressful for the dog too having screaming distressed kids around so taking the dog out of the situation sounds like the only sensible option. You did the right thing and the kids and the dog are lucky to have you looking out for them and making sure they will be as happy as they can be.
