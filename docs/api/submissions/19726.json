I don\u2019t know how true this is, but we were told we would likely never see them again if we didn\u2019t take them in.\n\nIt was hard. I don\u2019t regret a bit of it but we had to change many things.

She hates that I had to sacrifice so much even though I never signed up for it which I suppose I understand. She mostly despises the fact that I gave our dog away. I get that too. I was so heartbroken over it (I cried) but unlike what most people think, the constant exposure was making the 4 year old worse. Not even therapy was helping because he was so overwhelmed already. \n\nMy mom thinks I did a cruel thing and says my priority was the dog. I feel guilty.

Why didn't mom step up to the plate and volunteer to take the dog in? Otherwise, she can STFU.  I think we know who is TA in this scenario...\n\nAlso bravo for taking in your husband's sibs.  That is a selfless act that deserves praise, not a guilt trip.  Giving them a loving home instead of foster care might just save them from a terrible life.    \nAre there any social service agencies in the area that could help you out? You are saving the state big bucks by taking the boys in, there might be some subsidies to assist you with food etc.", "Nta at all. \n\nI bet if you\u2019d asked your mother to take the dog she would have said no. That\u2019s what happened to me, I needed to rehome my dog and I told everyone about it and struggled for months finding one and when he was finally gone they tried to come for me?? My sole argument is always \u201cyou should have taken him then\u201d", "NTA. You make a heartbreaking sacrifice and your mother is being cruel for punishing you. Why could she not have taken the dog if it meant so much to her?\n\nAt the end of the day, we need to support our children. You are supporting your inherited children, your mother needs to support hers.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your mom is on one about the dog.\n\nUnfortunately people have to give up pets all the time when they have children. Some pets are a legitimate danger to children. It is sad, but it is not like it is uncommon.\n\nMy neighbors directly across the street literally had to do the same thing. They had a dog for a few years before they had child. The dog kept growling at and acting aggressively towards the baby. Their only choice was to give the dog away.\n\nAnd it is not like it wasn't the well-behaved dog. It was very well trained. It walked on a leash. It sat and laid down when you told it to. It was loving and affectionate. It just got weirdly territorial about having to share the house with baby.", "NTA if mom is so heartbroken why didn't she take in the dog?\n\nYou rehomed her. You did right by the dog and are doing right by your nephews.\n\nShe wants the dog back she can go get her or take the kids so you can keep the dog.", "NTA. Of course giving away your dog when you live with a child with allergies is the right thing to do. In fact, it\u2019s the only decent choice, as hard as it is. Sorry, but I think your mom is actually being really immature", "NTA.\n\nYou're making big choices in a big mess (no offense), and we can tell that you're only doing what you need to. It's not like you've gone and put the dog down with a rifle, it's gone somewhere else. I think your mother needs to feel some sympathy for what you're going through.\nI hope everything goes well.", "NTA - You're trying to do the right thing by taking care of two kids who'd otherwise be in foster care. You're obviously trying to do right by them and if one of them is terrified of your dog, you made the right choice to let other loving dog owners take her instead.\n\nYou didn't just dump her at an animal shelter, you found loving owners for her. Your mom does not dictate what you do with your dog and is being very unsupportive in a time where you really don't need her kind of negativity. \n\nMy advice would be to make it very clear to your mom that the kids are your priority and to stop bringing up the dog. She's with loving owners and she's been taken care of. If she cannot understand that or let it go; there's the door and don't let it hit you on the way out.\n\nI'm proud of you and your husband that you made this really difficult choice to take care of these kids. You're doing right by them.", "NTA - Who the hell gives people crap for prioritizing a child over a pet? Having to re-home your pet is a very hard decision to make, and you obviously didn't make it lightly. But your mom... does she even acknowledge that there are children in the equation? Does your mom think that, since they're your husband's siblings, she doesn't have to think about them? She sounds like a monster.\n\nAnd if she was so in love with your dog, why didn't she re-arrange her whole life to keep it around?", "NTA, but your mom is seriously unhinged! I would have lost my mind on her, and you managed to stay relatively composed??  How are you even asking if you're the AH??  Your mom shouldn't be coming into your house and causing insane drama for attention, like you said: you have bigger things to worry about! \n\nSometimes you do have to give up your dog for reasons beyond your control.  It sounds like you tried therapy with your little one before rehoming your dog and it wasn't working and you didn't want them to live in terror anymore.  It's not good for your dog to be around someone who is that terrified.  You did your best for the kiddo and for your dog and that's all you can do.\n\nYou're doing your best to parent these children with really complex issues and that's amazing!  It sounds like you're doing a great job and trying to give them a positive home environment.", "NTA, You unexpected became a mother of two and had to give your dog to another family. You said it yourself, she's with loving owners. It's not like you kicked her out and let her become a stray. She's being taken care of and you're still adjusting to your new situation.", "If she cares so much about the dog why didn\u2019t she offer to adopt her? NTA", "NTA. I'm a crazy animal lover, and normally, I'd be horrified if someone just dumped off their dog...**BUT**,  obviously there are some life circumstances that are beyond our control. Your priority should be your kids. You are doing a very kind thing by keeping them with family and out of foster care. I'm so sorry your dog wasn't able to fit into that situation,  but if you have to choose between who goes into foster care- the dog or your toddler brothers- the choice is evident. Your mom sounds... interesting.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThis sounds incredibly tough, but also like you didn't have any other choice, and that you made sure the animal was well taken care of. Forgetting who your mother was talking about in a busy moment is entirely understandable, and making that out to be a big deal is incredibly unkind of your mom.   \n\n\nI'm sorry you're having such a rough time. Hang in there!", "NTA - Everyone is simply overwhelmed right now. You and your husband suddenly became parents which was not something either of you planned for. \n\nYour husband is working overtime to compensate for the additional costs of 2 kids. You are learning to become a mother to young children and juggling a job. And the kids are young, confused and lashing out in fear at the newess of their lives. It\u2019s simply overwhelming for all parties. \n\nYour mother is also overwhelmed and probably wants your life to return to the old one. Your dog, which both of you loved, was part of your former life. Right now is extremely emotional time for everyone. A dog who terrified the 4 year old was just one stressor your new family did not need. \n\nI love my pets and spend more time with them than people. I cannot imagine my life without them. So I can sympathize with you re-homing your dog and your mother\u2019s frustration. I can tell you truly loved your pet. \n\nBut life changes in unexpected ways and your new family\u2019s priority now is those two young children. Hang in there while there are \u201cgrowing pains\u201d in this situation. You and your husband are doing a wonderful, admirable thing. Good luck & best wishes to you both.", "NTA - by a long shot!\nYou had no choice but to prioritize the kids.  Your mom sounds... special...", "NAH. You're dealing with a lot and prioritizing your family's needs. It's not forgetting, it's focusing. Your mom is also upset, which is understandable. It's a tough situation; communication and understanding are key.", "NTA.  \nIt sounds like you made an effort to make the dog stay, it just didn't work. What were you supposed to do? Move out? Divorce your husband because the child was an issue and you wanted the dog more than him and the family?  \nI love animals and I hate seeing pets getting rehomed. But that is only those times when people don't try, and the \"animal is just a nuisance\" to them. You tried. It just didn't work.   \nYou made sure YOUR DOG came to a home with loving owners, and I am sure the dog is happy there now.   \nIt was not your mothers dog, and since she keeps guilt tripping you, I'd definitely put her in her place.  You didn't forget the dog, but does the wound need to be reopened EVERY TIME you see your mom? No. Life happens and you try to deal with it the best you can.  \nYour mom is a huge AH though.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I was prepared to find you the AH. But your circumstances warranted it, plus kudos to you for making the effort to find the dog a good home.\n\nPart of the situation missed here is that the dog was also likely stressed by the changes and the new emotional set up in the house, so with others is better for the dog as well.", "NTA\n\nYour mum is though for making an already extremely tough period of your life even harder. \n\nShe may not like that you have become parents in this way but honestly, when you get married, you become a unit and at a unit you and your husband made a decision to take in his younger brothers. That was no doubt a really hard decision and an incredibly big adjustment to make, so kudos to you both for doing that.\n\nMum misses the dog, does she really think you don't miss your own dog even more? And that it was anything other than heartbreaking for your to give up your beloved pet?\n\nBut who puts their dog above two young children in desperate need? Don't answer me, I know that some people would but you are NTA for putting thise kids first.\n\nShe may be grieving for the life she imagined you having but honestly, her behaviour is still appalling.", "NTA. Your mom needs to stop hassling you. Something is seriously wrong with her thought process and she is definitely the asshole here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But she already has two dogs that are quite a hassle so I guess that\u2019s why she never offered. Still, I guess if she cares so much she could\u2019ve taken her in. \n\nThank you so much. While we did it for the boys, it was also for selfish reasons. We love them too much to never see them again. I\u2019m not even related to them by blood but the thought of not having those two in my life\u2026 I can\u2019t even put into words. \n\nWe get some benefits but we haven\u2019t explored all our options yet so will definitely still be looking into stuff.

Mom was being a bit of a AH for walking into a situation in which her daughter was in crisis and insisting on repeatedly bringing up the dog.\n\n\\~\\~\n\nAnd it's likely not even about the dog, anyway. There's some other issue that's really upsetting mom, and it's not the dog. Does she fear that after adopting two young kids, the OP won't produce 'real' grandchildren for grandma?
