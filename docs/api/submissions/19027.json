They are almost adults and still won't do their own laundry, won't help with the cooking, won't clean anything that they made a mess and are just overall grubs, leaving their dirty tissues and clothes everywhere.\n\nLast night was the last straw for me when John spilt an entire bottle of orange juice on the floor and my mom told me to clean it up. I immediately started yelling at her saying she failed as a parent and instead of raising her sons to pull their own weight in this house and teaching them basic life skills, she let everyone else do it for them and never taught them a thing. She instantly started laughing at me and said I was insane to think that's how life really was there and that she raised all of us equally. I then told her that I can't wait til she grows old and will end up reliant on both of them cause I won't be around to help her out with anything and she can see how well she raised them. She told me that won't be happening cause she doesn't want them taking care of her when she's older. \n\nI stormed off to my room and cried for a good 10 minutes before packing a bag and driving to my boyfriend's house. When I told him what happened he said he understand why I feel the way I do but that I was quite harsh towards my mom and I should apologise for lashing out at her like that. My friend also says that I'm the AH and that I shouldn't speak to my mom like that.\n\nMy mom has since left two voicemails demanding I come back home now.

She failed totally.  \n\n*and instead of raising her sons to pull their own weight in this house and teaching them basic life skills, she let everyone else do it for them and never taught them a thing.* \n\nYep.   She's abused them, and you.  Their choices are theirs to make.  In your situation, **your own choices are enough for you** to handle.  \n\n*She instantly started laughing at me* \n\nNo remorse.  No accepting reality.  No admitting her wrongs.  She's truly abusive.\n\n*and said I was insane to think that's how life really was there* \n\n**You were right.  She's wrong.**  \n\n*and that she raised all of us equally.* \n\nShe's delusional.  Or manipulating you with her pretense while she knows very well what she's done and is still doing.  **Either way, she's wrong.**  And your new priority is to protect yourself from her and her behaviors.   \n\n*I then told her that I can't wait til she grows old and will end up reliant on both of them cause I won't be around to help her out with anything and she can see how well she raised them.* \n\nWell, that's natural and reasonable consequences to her own choices and actions.  **All you are really saying here is that you are done, you won't stick around to be used and abused more, and she's going to have the consequences of her choices** in the future.  \n\n*She told me that won't be happening cause she doesn't want them taking care of her when she's older.*\n\nSo, **she's telling you that your wants, needs, and feelings do not matter, and that she expects you to comply with her demands,** forever, dismissing and ignoring your own life and needs and feelings and all the damage she's done to you with her abuses, simply because it's what she wants.  This is pivotal, and one reason I'm saying this is abuse.  She doesn't see you as a person at all.  **She's telling you that her wants are more important than your needs.**  There's a proverb that is used often in the therapy subs:  **\"Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\"   Your mother is telling you the opposite:**  that she expects you to always be there, burning, in case she wants to warm her hands a little.  That's abuse.\n\n*I told him what happened he said he understand why I feel the way I do but that I was quite harsh towards my mom and I should apologise for lashing out at her like that.* \n\nHe doesn't really understand yet.  **What you did was stand up to your abuser and say that this was it, you aren't going to take being abused anymore.**  This wasn't you being a normal kid that got angry.  This was an abused person saying  No, not again.  It took great courage, to do what you did, and to say what you said.  **You do not owe her any apology for this, ever.** \n\nWas it a bit harsh?  If it was, it was also true.  When someone is abusive to you, for decades and decades of your life, the truth is going to be sounding harsh to someone who hasn't experienced it.  **It's okay that you told the truth, that you said things that are hard to hear, and are true.**  \n\n**You do not owe any apologies to your abusive mother for this.**   \n\nSometimes, those of us that have been abused will find ourselves drawn to new relationships that are also abusive.  I don't know if your BF is someone like the people at home, or if he's just clueless and ignorant about abuse when it's not seen in bruises.  Whichever he is, ***he's wrong that you need to apologize.***  **Your mother isn't a normal mother, and this isn't a normal situation in a normal family.  This is something different, dysfunctional.  You have been abused.**  **For you to apologize to your abuser for standing up to their abuse, is asking you to apologize for objecting to the abuse.**  You have a right to object to being abused.  You do not deserve to be treated like she's done.  And you do not owe an apology for telling the truth and protecting yourself.  \n\nI hope he's just ignorant and can learn that what you went through was not just one incident, but a lifetime of abuse.  If he can't, then you might need to protect yourself from him, too.  \n\n*My friend also says that I'm the AH and that I shouldn't speak to my mom like that.*\n\nSame as the boyfriend.  **Either they do not understand abusive houses, or they understand too well and want you to keep on taking it,** because they are like the abusers and want you to not object to their using you.  I lost a couple friends when we stood up to our abusive relative, because they were also using me and saw that I was learning to not take it anymore.\n\n\r*My mom has since left two voicemails demanding I come back home now.* \n\n**Of course she is.  She wants her scapegoat back,** to blame and accuse and use and dump her responsibilities on.  You do not have to go back.  Call around for shelters, if you can't stay with friends or other relatives to get on your feet.\n\n*I'm not going home until I have calmed down and she's not as angry.*\n\n**If it is at all possible,** even if you couch surf for a while, **only go back to get your most important stuff.**  If you have to leave some stuff, leave what can be replaced someday, and take only the things you need and most value, and all papers that have your important information on.  Many police stations will send someone with you to make sure that you are allowed to get in and get your stuff out, safely.\n\n**If you go back to live there, she's going to keep on getting in your head, and doing more harm to you.**  She's going to keep on doing all the same old things, but more intensely, to get your compliance again.  Abusers do not like to let us go.  And they will say all kinds of lies, to get us back.  \n\n**You are worth protecting.**  You have value.  **Your feelings and needs are valid,** and you never deserved the abuse you have gotten.  \n\nNTA.  **You objected to abuse.**  People aren't seeing it yet.  **That's not your fault.**  You deserve to escape that house and be somewhere where people will support you and help you get on your feet.", "You're NTA.
