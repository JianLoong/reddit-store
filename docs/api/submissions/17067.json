She constantly asks me to do her homework, and I do it like a big brother is supposed to do. \n\nBut recently (like, the previous months (since February or something)) she would ask me more and more to do her homework and that\u2019s getting tiring for me. She asks daily to do her homework and I\u2019m just slowly getting insane. She would just keep saying my name out loudly until I come to her and make her homework. My mother is also getting tired of her constantly saying my name out loud and then tells me to \u2018help\u2019 her with her homework, but in the end, my sister makes me do everything cause she will act like a dumb kid then and I have no evidence to prove it cause she acts smart around my parents. It\u2019s getting annoying, and I just don\u2019t want to do it. I even think I might be spending more time on her homework than mine.\n\nAITA for not helping my sister with her homework?", "created_utc": 1683901687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fmrbp/aita_for_not_helping_my_sister_with_her_homework/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You might be able to tell your parents in some way... Your handwriting on your work, is probably same as the one on hers. You can tell your mom 'see, here is some proof I've been doing (sis) work.\n\nAlso, I used to cheat on my work too. It didn't help me at all.

Explain that she\u2019s not going to learn anything if you just do her homework for her and that it\u2019s not your job to parent her.

For starters, stop doing it for her.  Just stop.  Let have a tantrum or whatever, but do not do her homework.  If you help her do it, set a time limit (one hour, 1/2 hour, whatever).  After all, you have to do your homework, too.    \nYou could also talk to your parents about them helping her also, or getting her a tutor.  \n\nThe most important thing is to stop doing it for her.", "NTA, simple solution?

Does your sister have learning disabilities? Fear of failure? she sounds smart, and it sounds like she is taking advantage of you, AND your mom is clueless.\n\nTell your mom the truth. Someone suggested finding out what's at the root of your sister doing this, and I agree. If she needs help, that's why there are tutors, whatever country you are in.\n\nNTA. But stop doing her homework, period."]}
