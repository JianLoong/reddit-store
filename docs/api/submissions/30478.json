My mom was overweight so she started using these weight loss shots, which whatever i didn\u2019t mind if it helped her be healthier, but the thing is she would always rub it in my face. Because i was doing my weight loss naturally, it was going by way slower for me, but because she was using artificial methods she was dropping weight super fast. She would always ask me how much i\u2019ve lost and then exclaim how much she\u2019s lost, despite not working for it at all, no lifestyle changes or anything. This was always super upsetting for me since i was trying really hard to lose the weight but it never seemed good enough because she always lost more. What she said tonight was super hurtful to me because she knows how much i hate my body. I looked at her and just said how rude that was and asked her to leave. She said it wasn\u2019t rude if she was simply concerned about my health. (Side note, I am not morbidly obese or anything, I am around 140 at 5\u201d5, so overweight, but nothing super life threatening or anything) To me, her comment did not seem to have anything to do with my health, but everything with my appearance. Honestly hearing her say that made me want to cry, maybe i\u2019m being sensitive but it seemed so rude. I called her out on her fake weight loss and said she had nothing to be proud of since she put in no work to make herself \u201chealthier.\u201d She started yelling and it caused a huge fight, so tell me, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1699333281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pmv0o/aita_for_calling_my_mom_out_on_faking_her_weight/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
