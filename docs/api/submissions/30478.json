You can only strengthen the muscles surrounding a joint, which stabilizes the joint and takes pressure off of it compared to just being overweight.", "Surely being fat does the same thing, right?", "There's so much in life to have fun and be joyous. Any little thing, even. For now, I'm hanging out in my garage, listening to the rain after a long day off of work, just fixing things up and making my garage into a workshop/hangout. Kids, I and friend all did it together. Oh! And we are rock hounds so lots of fun stuff to do with that! Dug up a bunch of crystals etc. \ud83d\ude0a", "Exactly. Of course, that also happens with the vast majority of weight loss, so it\u2019s not really surprising", "So it's essentially the same principle as dieting. Once the diet is over and everyone goes back to their normal eating habits they gain the weight back. Hence why your not supposed to diet  but make \"permanent healthier lifestyle changes\" instead.", "Also kids all are different. They grow at different rates. Some kids have genes that pop out from generations back. My FIL was 5\u201910\u201d and my MIL is 5\u20196\u201d maybe and my husband and his brother are both 6\u20196\u201d.", "It's sometimes not as simple as CICO if you mix hormones into it. Hormones control a lot of what our bodies do.\n\nAlso, a lot of people lose weight for aesthetics. Losing weight the \"wrong\" way won't help with that.\n\nIf you're talking about obese people, yeah losing weight is a priority if they want to continue living. And any weight lost is good for them. For plump or just fat people, that's oversimplifying things and can make them demotivated", "I wouldn't agree. Being active has so many benefits even if you find lossing the weight hard. You might find fixing your relationship with food easier once you feel better emotionally, and that might happen cause you're finding yourself in a better mood from the excersize. Yes you won't loose anything but encouraging people to move regardless of size is a good thing.", "I mean... I guess you could argue that extra weight will increase bone remodeling which will increase the bone density which would be a form of strengthening the joint. It's why you're more likely to get osteoporosis if you're low weight.", "Well yes obviously, but you know what I mean. \u201cStrengthens the joint\u201d is the colloquialism for that", "Yeah and that honestly makes a lot of difference", "No, why would it?", "Yeah, I'm on those shots for very resistant weight loss (gained around a hundred pounds a few years ago on a medication, and it has been a trail to move the scale back down). But the doctor's office was very clear from the beginning that the shots are to help me get back to my goal weight but I'm going to have to keep up the work with a healthy diet and exercise for the long haul.\n\nIf OP's mom isn't changing anything (which it sounds like) and letting the shots do the work for her, she will gain it all back if she stops getting them.\n\nMy Dr approaches the shot as a tool to use in addition to nutrition and exercise. Some are using the shot as \"the solution\" and it's really not.", "CICO is always the final answer, the calculation of what your body needs, how to manage any symptoms, how to deal with any extra issues is part of the journey, and can be dealt with professional or experienced help.  \nI'm not saying it's simple, nor easy, I'm just saying that in the end, you control your weight with what you eat, not how much you move. Hence sayings like \"you can't outrun a bad diet\"", "I see your point and I can agree with it, even tho I never experienced any kind of motivation and betterment through physical activities, it's well enough documented that it absolutely works for some people and should not be discarded without giving it a serious try \n\n\"But\" weight loss is mainly a mental battle against oneself, you're fighting decades of bad habits and routines, you have to be more stubborn than yourself, and rewrite your relationship with food and how you cope with your life through it is a big part of it. Physical activity will come and go, your plate will be in front of you at every meal \n\nAgain, not disagreeing with you at all", "Because you are working the joints harder", "Putting an additional load on the joint isn\u2019t the same as exercise. \n\nIn most cases, fat people are putting excessive loads on their joints without strengthening them through exercise. If the majority of your weight is muscle that has been gained through exercise, the exercise will also serve to strengthen your joints"]}
