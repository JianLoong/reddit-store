He, too, was concerned about my weight and called me out of the blue one day to ask how tall I was and what I weighed. I guessed (i was 15, i didn't know), and he told me, \"According to the chart in my doctor's office, you're overweight.\" This was '95. He would have had to memorize the chart. He went on about his concern too and blah blah blah. A few months later, by chance, I had the opportunity to measure and weigh myself. I was 5'8\" and 130lbs. I was off only a little on my height and weight. Not enough to cause concern. Since then, I have struggled with my body. I was urged to gain more weight with my first child because I was so worried about it. That wasn't the only incident, but it was the nail in the coffin.\n\nWhat your mom did and has done is absolutely inappropriate. I have a daughter (24), so I think I have the credentials to say so.

You get to do with it as you please. \n\nYou should know that the way your mom is doing it, she is more likely to gain it all back, plus some. Crash diets like that work, but they aren't sustainable. The way you're doing it works too, but it is much more sustainable. You also won't gain like your mom will during rough times when you can't make it to the gym.\n\nThere's also nothing wrong with rest. Rest is important all the time, but especially when we're going through something rough. Rest should always be what you need within healthy boundaries. It's easy to slip from rest to depression if things are really rough. \n\nCan you do ten sit-ups and ten push-ups in your room? A leisurely walk in a park? That's still movement. That's still exercise.\n\nI'm proud of you for standing up for yourself. It takes courage to stand up to adults, let alone our parents.
