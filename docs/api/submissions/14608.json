She always has.\n\nI was visiting grandma for a couple of weeks and saw the family three times. First time they asked if I was her grandson and suggested it would be nice for grandma and their dad to get together, second time they actually followed me to my car while I was going to get groceries and asked if I would talk to grandma about it. The third time I was doing yard work and they stop to chat. They tell me how their dad really likes my grandma, how she's been alone and crying for my grandpa for too long and I should encourage her to marry their dad and find another happily ever after because she doesn't realize how lonely she must be now that she's all alone.\n\nI told them they were crazy if they thought my grandma didn't know herself and they said she's lying to herself.
