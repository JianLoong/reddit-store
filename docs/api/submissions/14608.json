She's been a widow since she was 21. Raised her daughter alone after my grandpa died while serving the country and when my mom went down a dark path and had me and didn't want me she stepped in and raised me. Anyone who knows her knows she is happily single and focuses on other stuff. About twenty years ago a couple moved in next door to her. The wife died six years ago. Ever since the widower has been trying to get my grandma to marry him. She told me about it a few times and I have seen the guy try to get closer to grandma. His family (I believe his two daughters and son) have even asked grandma to consider a companionship with him. She said no. She always has.\n\nI was visiting grandma for a couple of weeks and saw the family three times. First time they asked if I was her grandson and suggested it would be nice for grandma and their dad to get together, second time they actually followed me to my car while I was going to get groceries and asked if I would talk to grandma about it. The third time I was doing yard work and they stop to chat. They tell me how their dad really likes my grandma, how she's been alone and crying for my grandpa for too long and I should encourage her to marry their dad and find another happily ever after because she doesn't realize how lonely she must be now that she's all alone.\n\nI told them they were crazy if they thought my grandma didn't know herself and they said she's lying to herself. Nobody is happily widowed for fifty something years and doesn't miss the love and companionship of a romantic partner. They started getting overly chatty on my grandma's lack of a sex life and I told them to leave us the fuck alone.\n\nThey told me I didn't need to be so rude and was holding grandma back. They then complained to grandma that she had raised me to be an ass. Grandma laughed that they were so outraged given what they were talking about.\n\nBut AITA for being so rude to them?", "created_utc": 1681306191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jmbpe/aita_for_calling_my_grandmas_neighbors_family/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that they can\u2019t just let it go is scary too! Just because he like your grandma and they\u2019re both widowed doesn\u2019t mean your grandma needs or should love him Back and they should get married & live happily ever after! They\u2019re a little too persistent for my liking and no, grandma didn\u2019t raise an ass, she raised a man who isn\u2019t afraid to speak up for himself & his grandma! Tell them to back TF off!", "NTA. Some people don't understand no means no.", "NTA\n\nIf these were the opening scenes of a horror movie, I'd assume that the neighbors are out to murder you and your sweet grandma.\n\nIt was within your right to tell them to back the fuck off. How clear does it have to be for them that your grandma is not interested in any romantic relationship whatsoever?\n\nAlso, that bit about them talking about your grandma's sex life? Say what now? What the actual fuck.", "NTA, they are harassing you and your grandmother. They clearly overstepped their bounds and deserved a rude response. I'd tell them any further imposition and you'll report them to the police. Your grandmother doesn't owe this man a relationship, if he wants a new wife he should go find someone who's willing.", "NTA. This sounds almost like harassment? I'm not sure nor qualified to give any legal advice. But it's definitely not okay.", "Wtf is this, a family of maniacs, lunatics. Your grandma is old enough to decide on her own, no is no. End. What sex life at 70+ years are they talking about and under what right they talk about your grandma? Wtf. NTA!!!", "NTA - She said no. That is the end of it. They need to back off. I would install security cameras and tell them to leave your grandmother alone and to stop trespassing.", "NTA, and I suggest getting security cameras to record them harassing her.  Maybe record them with her phone when they come up and start bothering her? If they keep persisting, and she has video proof, maybe she could get a PPO or the cops might go talk to the family and tell them to stop.", "NTA \\~ Don't even engage with them anymore, that family sounds as they have mental issue's, just keep on doing what you were doing.  Your grandma is smart and happy.", "NTA.\n\nBefore you go over there next get all the info you can on in home senior care, assisted living facilities etc. Hand them the info and tell them if they need someone to look after grandpa so badly they can pay someone to do it and to leave your grandma tf alone", "NTA.  They have a lack of boundaries and entitlement which is inappropriate and scary.  I\u2019m glad you stood up for your grandma\u2026.", "NTA and I would probably go as far as to tell them if they don't stop approaching you and even more your grandma on your property that you get a restraining order cause you never know what people do.", "NTA, kudos to your grandma. I suspect some alterior motives are making that family be so insistent on marrying them off, but if your grandma is not even entertaining the idea it is real red flag from them to be trying to convince you, repeatedly, and even talk about her sex life. If I was you, I'd probably joke that your grandma has plenty of good sex life thank to the toys you give her for every Christmas :D Just to mess with them a bit more.", "NTA. These people obviously want a free caregiver for gramps. Tell them to stay away. I wouldn\u2019t even say hi to them at this point.", "NTA some people don't get it until you get rude with them. But why wouldn't you want them to be your new step-family? They sound lovely.  ;)", "NTA. This widower next door and his family are trying to find a way to take advantage of your grandma and you DID need to use choice words, because just being firm and direct isn't enough for them.  Since you are not around all the time, encourage your grandma to let you know if they keep pestering her. 70 is not old for a woman who has looked out for herself her entire adult life, but she is one person, and they are a pack of idiots who might need the reality check of a restraining order.", "NTA\n\nYou were nicer than I would\u2019ve been.", "Have a lawyer send them a cease and destiny letter on her behalf and place no trespassing signs.", "NTA. Do you really need to ask? I\u2019d have massacred them if they kept on insisting this much. It\u2019s beyond creepy and 0 respect. Threaten to call the police for harassment if they try to bring that topic up again.", "They sound like they are after getting into her house, jewellery, pension checks, or an inheritance. Like, it's that suss. Chasing an uninterested widow when the single woman population in that bracket is high. Widowers are seriously outnumbered. He's chasing something besides love and it's unsettling.\n\nThat his kids are determined to pair him off with her rather than just find him \"someone\" is not making it less creepy.\n\nNTA, but maybe think about cameras.", "NTA at all, though your response might have created more problems than it solved seeing that your grandmother has to live next door with these people. But they are AWFUL - so presumptuous, relentless, selfish, and disrespectful...your words to them were correct.", "This is so weird! I\u2019m assuming there were multiple advances politely rejected by this point - I probably would\u2019ve felt similarly.\n\nInstead of saying they were crazy and shouting curse words, I would\u2019ve firmly said something like\n\n\u201cLook - I can appreciate that you want both our grandparents to have companionship. But my grandmother is not interested in a romantic relationship. Your recurring insistence that they try dating/marrying with each other has crossed a line and it needs to stop.\n\nShe has said she\u2019s not interested multiple times. And now you\u2019ve asked me behind her back to try and make it happen. I say one more time, she is not interested, and we would appreciate no further comments on this.\u201d\n\nSoft YTA for the outburst, though I fully understand why you\u2019re upset, and tbh some people just won\u2019t take no for an answer. \n\nOverall, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
