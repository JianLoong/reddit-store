As expected she was still insisting that I copy the other dress design. I still refused and told her if she wasn't going to budge on this then I'm leaving. As I started grabing my stuff, she said fine and asked if would let her have my dress. I was stunned. She started going off that it's her big day and she deserves to look like a princess and if she can't have the sara burton dress then the least I could do was let her use my dress since it was never used and just sits in my closet collecting dust. I left and went home to relax and honestly cry after what just happened. As expected a few members of the family texted me again upset that I won't let her use my dress.\n\nFor back ground, I was engaged back in 2018 but called the wedding off in 2019 for personal reasons I will not discuss. I designed the dress myself and sewed it, but my grandmother added all the little details on it, I'm talking indian style wire threading, rhinestone everything. I couldn't bring myself to get rid of the dress, but I also knew I'd never feel comfortable wearing it again after the engagement ended. My grandma sadly passed away shortly after due to covid. I did end up gifting the dress to my friend for Christmas. We supported each other during our dark times and she finally remarried earlier this year so she wore the dress to her reception.\n\nBack to the actual story. My cousin apparently told our family that I was being unfair and that since I didn't feel like designing a dress for her, she asked if she could use mine just for the ceremony so it would feel like she had grandma there with her, and I told her no. I sent the recording I had to everyone who texted me and they were shocked. Most apologized but a few who I've decided to block still thought I should let her have it since I would never wear the dress. When they found out that I gifted it to someone else they were even more upset since according to them I clearly wasn't attached to it since I gave it away, and it would've meant more to cousin than to my friend who didn't even know grandma.\n\nLike most people suggested I did go NC with cousin after this.\n\nTldr cousin decided if I wouldn't steal a design I should give her my dress", "created_utc": 1682562988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1307f2x/update_aita_for_not_designing_my_cousins_wedding/", "score": 476, "replies": ["Still NTA.\n\nSpoiler: cousin's marriage won't last.", "I cannot believe the audacity of your cousin.", "That link doesn't link to the original post but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kwkp5/aita_for_not_designing_my_cousins_wedding_dress/) does.", "NTA.
