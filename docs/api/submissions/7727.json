No, not everyone would do the same.  It's your money and you don't have to share or involve her in decisions but why is she your fiancee if you don't want to?", "YTA, if you're engaged that means you've committed to building a life together, which means making decisions together. Sounds like that's not actually what you want and maybe you both need to sit down and reevaluate what you want.", "YTA in a sense - Yes, it is your money and your house BUT what a way to start your future together. So simply because you can afford the house on your own doesn't make it her home as well? Note that I seperate the terms house and home for a reason. Can you imagine if one person is the sole breadwinner and the other stays home to lets say take care of the kids, does that entitle the breadwinner to dictate what house to buy, where to live, what to own etc? I currently live in my bfs house, I respect fully that it is his house but he has told me countless times that it is also my home and I should be comfortable and that if we need to change things to discuss it, have a plan and see if it can be done where we would both be happy.\n\nThe reality is your supposed to be a team and if the house you have purchased is to be used by you 2 before and or after the wedding then it is both of your home. I therefore think she should be able to have a say in certain things in the house to make herself comfortable. If you plan to live your life with this person by constantly telling her your money your rules, you need to rethink the relationship, stay single and then you can make ALL the decisions you want on your own. This clearly isn't a partnership.", "INFO: do the two of you live together? Is her name on the apartment lease?

Why in the name of god would you expect your fianc\u00e9e to live in a house that she couldn't consider her home too? She's going to be living there WITH YOU, she should get a say in whether her home is comfortable to live in.\n\nI understand if you inherited a large sum of money and want to retain that money as personal assets rather than commingled marital assets, and I understand if you're worried that just because you inherited a large sum of money she thinks she can spend it all willy nilly. In that case, you need a prenup, and a calm discussion of finances and how you expect them to go in your relationship.\n\nBut what it sounds like is you expect your fianc\u00e9e to live like a tenant in your home with you. No wonder she's not talking to you. Buying her some new things to placate her and \"generously\" agreeing she no longer has to pay rent in the apartment you'll both be moving out of after the renovations are done doesn't change the fact that you expect her to move into your house while never allowing her to think of it as her home too.", "Just break up with her if you don\u2019t want to share your house and life with her.

You bought a house she told you she didn't like, you're refusing to compromise with her on any of the renovations on that house, and are just shutting her down at every turn.

If so and she knew full well that she would not be on the deed then yeah, she has no right to tell you how to decorate your home, but also bear in mind that she will also be living there with you so maybe letting her have a room to herself would be compromise?

In this situation, OP's fiancee/future wife has no say in her own home and is homeless if the relationship ends?", "Yeah that to. OP might not be ready for forever just yet. But the reaction tells me she would try to go to court and say that it was \"their house\" and is entitled to half the value.", "FYI both OP and the fianc\u00e9 are women", "IANAL but I'm pretty sure assets purchased with an inheritance are not considered an inheritance anymore.\n\nI think it would be different if he'd actually inherited the house, but in this case he is purchasing it.\n\nIf they got married and lived in the house, I wouldn't be surprised if it was included in marital assets. At the very least, she'd have an argument to make in court.", "Eh, with that in mind I\u2019m thinking these two just shouldn\u2019t marry. I mean I really do value independence and owning your keep so I\u2019m a little torn on the issue, because on one hand if I had the money for it I\u2019d totally buy my dream home and make it exactly how I want it. But if I had a partner in the mix that would be more complicated. Maybe OP needs to find someone who has similar interests and will enjoy moving in with her later down the line rather than moving into the house with her current partner.", "*wife and wife", "Never said gold digger.\nIt's not her money, yet she's still spending it mentally. It's Ops, the partner only has a say \"If\" Op says it's ok.", "Lawyer here. This is spot on.", "Thanks for this. Interesting to know. I\u2019m speaking from outside the US where defacto status is seen as having default rights (to a decent degree) to shared assets. And even moreso with engagement/marriage/kids etc", "They\u2019re getting married, just because it\u2019s not \u201clegal\u201d yet doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t act like it. \n\nRegardless, I feel like she would have this attitude if even if they were married.", "Ah yeah ok, my bad.", "In my country it dos yes, which kinda makes sense. If you didn't participate in buying the house,  you supposedly have money on the sides. Now of course people are civil and usually who throw the other in the streets once they break up, but if it's a house owned by one, the other eventually has to leave.", "Totally reasonable", "Not a lawyer but my dad is a real estate lawyer. I\u2019m an architect so it\u2019s one of those shared interests that we both enjoy discussing so I\u2019ve learned a lot from him on this.", "That's awesome \ud83d\ude00"]}
