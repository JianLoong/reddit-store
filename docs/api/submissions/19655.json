It\u2019s too late to play the \u201cspend some time with the dog before he passes\u201d card if today is truly the day.  Assuming some of your siblings are quite young, they might meltdown and cause more problems than it\u2019s worth.  And your parents are doing what\u2019s right by the dog if it\u2019s quality of life is severely compromised.", "INFO how old are the siblings?", "I'm hesitant but for the sake of judgement, I'm going to say ESH. \n\nYour parents 100% suck for not being open to everyone about what is going on with the dog. It's really their responsibility and not yours. But, if they're not going to do the right thing, then maybe you should.", "YTA. This is a decision best left to your parents. They may have their reasons or their timelines for doing this.", "NTA--but personally I would tell them, or at least the older ones.  Not telling them does what for the kids?  It's not going to save them any grief and will only add an extra layer to it so I don't get why the parents are doing this.", "I dont understand all the YTA opinions, it hasnt happened yet from what i can read so theres no way the verdict can be YTA. NTA OP, your parents are. they should tell them so that they can spend time with him. i do however think you should tell\n\nedit: spelling", "Idk that this is strictly on you, your parents are the AH's here for not telling them. But for the sake of the bot, YWBTA.", "YTA and so are your parents, not about the decision to put the dog down but about how they're handling the situation: your siblings maybe want to see the family dog one last time to say goodbye, take a photo or video to remember it.\n\nInstead, if I understand correctly, your parents want to do it without saying anything. Imagine coming home, never seeing the dog again, and being told, \"We had him put down.\"\n\nHow would you feel?", "INFO - ages of all siblings and your age?", "INFO - Do the 5 siblings live in the same house as the dog? Or in the same city?", "YWNBTA \n\nIt is the family dog and your siblings deserve to know. If I were in your position I would let my siblings know. You have a decision whether you tell them or not. I don't think not telling them would make you an AH either.", "NTA, but as a lover of heelers, this makes me sad. Only 1 yr old? Poor pup.", "Info: \nare these siblings who live at home and have been around the pup for the past year? \nDo they have an attachment to him/her? \nDid your parents give a reason for not telling everyone?", "It's not your responsibility to handle the fall out. I think they should be told. I've had several pets that were home when I went to school and not when I got home. It sucked that I never got to say goodbye. But I don't blame my siblings who knew. It is the parents job to make those calls. Whatever you decide NTA you're wanting a positive thing.", "my siblings are 13, 12(the one that knows), 10, 7, & 4", "My dad is still angry with my grand parents for giving away his dog when he went to college.  That was in the 70s.", "I'm 16, my siblings are 13, 12(the one that knows), 10, 7, & 4", "We all live in the same house", "They all live in the same house, they're all attached to him, & they haven't given a reason to why they won't tell them till after its done", "They should know what is about to happen to their dog.", "With those ages I think this is ultimately your parents call. However, it would be reasonable for you to talk to your parents about this and tell them why you think it might be better to tell your siblings.", "NTA - And its very weird that your parents haven't told the others, unless its a situation where they haven't told them but aren't hiding it.", "I already have talked to them about telling my siblings before, but they have said they will tell them when it's already done.", "Then you have done the best you can. Your parents are faced with a difficult situation and there isn\u2019t necessarily a right or a wrong way to handle it. \nI\u2019m sorry your family is facing this loss.", "I think YWBTA if you don\u2019t at least tell the older ones. I would be devastated and have trouble forgiving someone who could have given me last moments with my dog but didn\u2019t tell me those last moments were TODAY.\n\nI could maybe see an argument against telling for 4 year old and Maybe 7 because it is hard to understand and they may not have a good concept of death and \u201cquality of life\u201d so that is a difficult conversation a parent should give if that is the case.\n\nBut the older ones deserve a chance  to have goodbyes with their beloved pet.\n\nEDIT: Made an addition after seeing the ages.", "I would say NTA I think, as its your parents choice, however it is a colossally cruel choice and your siblings wouldn't be in the wrong for reacting negatively. Hell if we jumped forward 30 years and your siblings still have it as a sore spot and get mad all over again when the dog is brought up, they would be justified.\n\nThere is also a chance they will be mad at you for not telling them, but then there's also a chance your parents will be mad and punish you if you're honest, so you are kind of stuck.", "NTA, based on your and your siblings\u2019 age, I guess it is a mature thing to decide telling the kids after the deed was done.", "This happened to me with my cat. I was *pissed*. Came home from school, she wasn't there. Got told at dinner time several hours later. It's fucked up.", "I  can imagine a counter-argument to this, depending on the age of the children. My parents took the opposite route when I was a kid, telling me that my beloved cat would be euthanized in two days. I still remember those as among the worst days of my life. I can't even get into how traumatic they were. It would have been much, much easier for me if I had simply come home one day and told that the vet said it was time to put the cat down.", "It undermines the relationship between the child and the parents and leads the child to have trust issues and think that the parents can keep anything hidden.", "Why did they tell the 12 y/o and not the 13 y/o?", "My first cat died when I was around 13 I think, it\u2019s sad but a 10-13 year old can definitely handle it. The 7 and 4 year old might not understand but everyone deserves the change to hug their pet goodbye or be there as they pass away."]}
