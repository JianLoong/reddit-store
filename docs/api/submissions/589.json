She started to message a friend of mine and said that she was going to message him from my phone saying that his brother was hot. \n\nWhile this was just supposed to be a joke I didn\u2019t appreciate it and asked for my phone back before she sent the message. As she continued to type I asked for my phone again and was ignored. After that I tried to reach for my phone but she moved it away from me and towards her right side. I should have just stopped there I feel. \n\nAs the phone was farther away I tried to grab it from behind her. This caused me to be on her back trying to get my phone as she laid down on the couch. I thought that we were playing at this point because she was still trying to type on the phone. My weight eventually pushed her off the couch and I took my phone from her hands. \n\nThis is where I knew I had done something wrong. She was immediately upset and said that I had pushed her off and could have killed her ( fireplace was a few feet away). She said that I may as well have hit her and that both were the same in her eyes. She thinks I\u2019m a domestic abuser at this point and I\u2019m beginning to think so as well. She said that in the moment the phone was more important than her which isn\u2019t untrue and makes me feel awful.

She disrespected you first, and you reacted accordingly. Asking for your phone and getting it back should have been the end of it. That\u2019s insane behavior and a HUUUUUUGE red flag dude. You didn\u2019t even push her, you were reaching for your phone that she refused to give back and she fell because she refused. For her to jump straight to \u201cabuse\u201d is spitting in the face of domestic abuse victims. Shame on her.", "NTA. She continued when you said stop. She refused to give your phone back and escalated the situation. She needs to look at her own behaviour for domestic abuse first", "NTA - note today as the day your relationship should have ended. Very simply, you inform her that you will not accept being accused of being a domestic abuser and as far as you are concerned she can apologize and admit it was uncalled for, or you will consider the relationship over.

She's manipulating you with this behaviour, blaming you for not respecting her when the opposite is true.

Maybe suggest that she go find a child to date instead of you? She\u2019s claiming you are abusive because she wants to try and track the attention from the fact that she doesn\u2019t know how to be an adult.

Not only did she start it, then continued the abuse, but now she is spreading a rumor that you are the abusive one. She is bullying you big time and you should end this relationship asap.

You two were playing around, sort of but more so she was bullying and you were trying to stop it. Not domestic violence.\n\n\"What is Domestic Violence. Domestic violence is\u00a0a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner.\"\n\nThis is not what happened.\n\nYou may have been a bit too aggressive, but honest, many would have done the same and what were you supposed to do since she wasn't  responding  to the conversation and your request to have your property back. \n\nIf you are ever in this situation again before it gets this far stop and let them know that their actions are a violation and disrespectful and if they cannot respect you need to really think about this relationship.\n\nHonest, no means no not just for sexual consent. It is for property, emotional and mental well-being and her \"joke\" made you uncomfortable and she should have respected your feelings and your property when you asked her to stop. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

There is no coming back from this as she told everyone you are abusive. Her family and friends will never look at you the same again.\n\nYou told her you didn't find the joke funny and you wanted your phone back. She continued against your protest. She is now lying and gaslighting you.\n\nThis is a game for her, and her goal is to make you suffer.", "There is so much wrong here I don\u2019t even know where to start. You didn\u2019t abuse her. Abuse is intentional. Y\u2019all were playing. Sometimes this happens when people play.

Leave her and tell everyone that what really happened is that she was using your phone to text a bad text and wouldn't let you have your phone back after you told her no. \n\nIf you stay, she will do worse in the future.\n\nAnd regardless of what others say, you getting your phone back is not physically aggressive, she was aggressively keeping your phone from you and you had no alternative course of action that would have kept her from going through with her prank that she was strangely determined about.", "NTA but she sure is the abusive one. Gaslighting is a horrible form of abuse and I would think long and hard if you want to be in a relationship who will manipulate and emotionally abuse you like that. When you asked for the phone back she should have immediately given it back to you how it escalated was on her because she could have avoided and stopped at any time by returning your property. Her falling of the couch was a result of a circumstance she started and caused.

She was doing something you didn't want her to on your phone and instead of giving the phone up she tried to play.\n\nShe's also extremely insensitive to actual victims of domestic violence and for her to connect that to your little rough play shows some very alarming immaturity.

You did nothing wrong by doing so.\n\nYou did not abuse her, it sounds like you need to get your story out to your mutual groups because the person who tells their story first is believed, and cut ties with her and her family.
