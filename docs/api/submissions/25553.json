In her age and she doesn't do anything not even her own plate. **She thinks I am some kind of unpaid nanny ** to her and recently I stopped cooking for her after **she called me the B word** once and told her I didn't marry her father to coddle an adult she will carry her own shit together. She told me I am \"unfair\" and only care about my daughter not her which baffled me she was comparing herself to a child. Back to the bed argument  she accused me of wanting to make her life harder by having her roommate with a child I told her she can find herself a place if she wants with adults.

It makes sense to prioritize your own small child over your adult stepchild. But that comment I replied to says that OP should only care about their child, not their stepchild. Which I disagree with. You can prioritize one and still care for both.", "Just wanted to add, sometimes \u201cstep parents\u201d are told to back off completely.

They're human beings. They don't have to keep trying to win the kid over in the hopes of having a relationship some day. They're allowed to give up. The step kid can't then go complain \"oh my step parent doesn't care about me\" if they've denied every opportunity to build a relationship.\n\nThis is the exact AITA mentality I hate. You people don't see step parents as actual human beings. You always flip flop on what step parents are. It's always whatevers convenient for the child. When the kid needs something, they're supposed to be parental figured and do everything possible to make the kid happy.

Most people would be better off staying at home, even more so with the current economy. Social ties and more financial flexibility are always good.

I'm on the other end where I moved out for several years at 17, moved home, and was living without my parents again a little over a year after because one parent died and the other left. It sucks.
