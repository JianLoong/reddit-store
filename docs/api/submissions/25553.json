But now our child is growing and a crib isn't suitable anymore so **we've decided to get her a new bed in my stepdaughter's room as our room doesn't have enough space for a regular bed**. Upon hearing that she refused that her young sister to move in her room. I told her we could not have the young girl clumped in a crib so she would have a room for herself.    \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe has been tiresome all along. In her age and she doesn't do anything not even her own plate. **She thinks I am some kind of unpaid nanny ** to her and recently I stopped cooking for her after **she called me the B word** once and told her I didn't marry her father to coddle an adult she will carry her own shit together. She told me I am \"unfair\" and only care about my daughter not her which baffled me she was comparing herself to a child. Back to the bed argument  she accused me of wanting to make her life harder by having her roommate with a child I told her she can find herself a place if she wants with adults. She then blew off and started cursing telling me I shouldn't try to kick her out and that's her father's house to which I said I wasn't kicking you out I was giving you solutions and your sister has as much in this house as you and you'll share a room.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe left me and slammed the door then called her father crying telling him I was kicking her out of the house then he called me I explained what happened. We are still carrying the bed plans but he told me I shouldn't have told her to move out that was insensitive of me. Even though I offered to help her.\n\n\nEdit \n\n-Yes she and her father talked about her moving out and she promised her to do when she is 22. He told me I shouldn\u2019t have talked to her because all her talks about moving out were ones that I weren\u2019t physically present with them wile they were having them. So she was surprised I told her that and part of it she called him crying \n\n-Yes her father wants her out and won\u2019t get a bigger place just so she would get a free solo room.\n\n-Yes she works 3 days a week and we told her we will help her \n\n-My daughter was in a crib first then we got her a bigger one but now she needs a regular bed that we already purchased \n\n-Already stated but the reason why her and I have a rocky relationship is that she expects me to be her unpaid servant while she disrespects me and expects her little sister to clumped in a crib so she would have a room.\n\n-Already stated but a regular bed won\u2019t fit in our room.\n\n-Her bio mum lives out of town and she doesn\u2019t wanna get out of town.", "created_utc": 1693062571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161xpvc/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_to_move_out/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
