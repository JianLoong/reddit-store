You needed a commitment which was perfectly understandable. Also, you didn't freak out the first time you heard about the tournament - you waited for her to decide until the point at which you absolutely had to know.

Look, I can understand that your wedding probably isn't a huge thing to a 16-year-old, but your aunt is an adult and she should be teaching her daughter to honor her commitments (since she said \"yes\" to being in your wedding before she knew there was a volleyball tournament). And you didn't even kick her out... she refused to commit, so obviously, you had to make a final decision.\n\nThat said, I think you'll be happier in the long run if you can forgive your cousin and move on and work to reconcile and be close again.

Yeah the day is about you but it\u2019s super weird to be this upset about a high schooler making her volleyball tournament instead of candle lighting. Not sure this was much of a close family relationship if you\u2019re being this catty over a 16 year old playing sports.", "YTA because it sounds like you're shunning the family because a child had a commitment that it was impossible to get out of. What was she supposed to do, let her entire team down, be hated by all the kids for doing that and completely ruin her chanced of being on the team again, like ever? Because no team is going to take someone who opts out of tournaments for personal stuff unless someone is dying. She didn't choose not to make your wedding a priority, she had a previous commitment that she couldn't renege on. Maybe don't shun family for things they can't help. That kid is at least as hurt as you are by your behavior. Obviously she couldn't be part of the wedding party, but acting like she committed a crime against you and slagging her to others at the wedding? Yeah, YTA.", "YTA\n\n>I had gone to so many of my cousin's volleyball games where the day had been about her and this day my wedding I wanted it to be about me and my now husband.\n\nWhy are you competing for attention with a child? Skipping tournaments, even pre-season ones, is a good way to miss out on team culture and it sounds like volleyball is your cousin's life. Many people use dedication to sports to get scholarships, which is significantly more important than lighting candles at a cousin's wedding, especially the kind of cousin that uses anything less than total commitment to her as a reason to trash the entire relationship between families. \n\nYou're the adult, it's on you to handle not getting everything you want the exact way you want it with grace. It's hard to believe your cousin was even that important to you before this if you're willing to just cut her out completely over something so out of her control. A 29 year old having a teenage family member miss their wedding is a bummer- but to be 16 and have an adult family member push you out of their life because your coach added a tournament to your team's schedule? That's heartbreaking, and could potentially cause lasting psychological damage or self esteem issues that impacts her ability to trust relationships later on. \n\nYou owe this kid an apology for being petty in my opinion.", "NAH except your aunt???\n\nI think your hurt is understandable but you're lacking some perspective, however I don't think you're an AH. It strikes me that most of the hurt could have been avoided if your aunt had just called it for her daughter and let you know they couldn't commit to the wedding after all. Out of respect for you and the time and effort that goes into planning a wedding, AND out of respect for her daughter who is a teenager and probably (understandably) wanted to prioritize her team sport over her cousin's wedding but didn't want to hurt you.", "YTA.  Your wedding is the most important thing in your life right now, and that\u2019s ok.  It\u2019s not the most important thing in everyone else\u2019s life, and expecting it to be, especially for a 16yo who has no control over when her sports tournaments are scheduled, and cutting her out of your life for not prioritizing you, makes you TA.", "YTA. In 10th grade her volleyball tournament takes precedent. Her mom telling you that the tournament fell the weekend of your wedding was your signal thatcshe had another commitment.", "NTA I think the wedding of a close family member outranks a volleyball tournament. At the very least, you deserved a straight answer about whether or not they planned on attending. Hope you have a fabulous day.", "NAH. No point in hounding someone to attend when it\u2019s obvious they want to place more value on a game that does nothing. I would understand more if there were recruiters or maybe someone super important at this game but\u2026to miss your cousins wedding? You guys are such a small family unit already, why miss the big things when you don\u2019t have to?", "Yta.\n\nNot for deciding to cut her out of the wedding if she couldn't commit. Although I'd argue there's little harm in keeping her in the program (or even not) and allowing her to light a candle if she was there. I mean, I assume she got a dress and everything? And I assume given her age despite being part of the \"wedding party\" she wasn't going to the bachelorette or participating in some of the more adult traditions? You made up a role for her to make her feel included. (And, I wager, because you are closer to her sister and felt like it was right to involve both. Which is laudable). \n\nNo, you took what wasn't personal personal. She's 16. You could have said \"too bad! We'll miss you and I really did want you there!\" As opposed to the \"You obviously don't care for me as much as I thought you did so I am going to force the issue because I have to print the programs and it's important people know who the people lighting the candles are\".\n\nIn other words, you could have handled this like it wasn't a big deal. You always have the option to handle things with grace or insist on taking offense. If there are lingering hurt feelings that is causing the holidays not to be celebrated, I think the reason for it rests on your (adult) shoulders.", "NTA for having her step aside from the commitment she was breaking anyways. But I would try to put this behind you, OP. Life is too short to harbor negative feelings. \n\nThat said, I think families prioritize weddings differently and the responses here reflect that a bit. In my family, a first cousin of the bride or groom wouldn\u2019t dream of missing a wedding - especially teenagers who might get to party a bit. In my husband\u2019s family it\u2019s totally different. They aren\u2019t very close and we often aren\u2019t even invited to weddings of his first cousins. Family culture might be affecting how hurt OP might feel BUT she\u2019s still an adult and as an adult, I don\u2019t think she should hold this over a child\u2019s head.", "NTA, if she wasn\u2019t 100% planning to come, then there\u2019s no point wasting resources getting her a dress and including her in the festivities. Why would you keep a spot open at that point\n\nPerhaps she could have attended as a guest if she had made it back from her tournament in time, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t, which further validated your choice.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily take such offense to it, because teenagers are unreliable at best, but specifically removing her from the party was the only reasonable course of action at that point.", "YTA, she is a child and made other commitments that dont revolve around you. It sucks that she's missing your wedding and your allowed to be sad but holding it against a child is petty and childish, makes me think your not ready to get married if your holding it against a child.\n\nsports have an expectation. Many teams have a rule if you skip a game, you sit out the next one. Is that always fair? no but thats life. \n\nChildren should be allowed to change their commitments without backlash because they were kids. They have activities, they hav a life, they have routines and schedules in place. It's a long day and sometimes days/weeks leading up to it. You were made well aware in advance that she likely wont make it, you still hae time to work around her and nothing was ruined. Grow up and realize the world doesn't revolve around the bride aka you. \n\nTo be fucking honest I'd rather go hang out in a daycare then watch someone get married and deal with the insane and not at all reasonable requests Brides think they can get because people are too scared to tell them no.", "ESH. Get over a teenager not wanting to light a candle at your wedding. There are other people in your wedding party supporting you.", "NTA Them telling you she would \"try to do both\", is not a useful response when you are planning an event.  It is great that she has found something she enjoys, but her parents should be teaching her that family comes first. A once in a lifetime wedding is more important than a volleyball tournament.  Life milestones take priority over school and work whenever possible. It is okay that you feel hurt. I am not sure why they are upset you took her out of the wedding when they could not even commit to her being there.", "YTA for being so dismissive about her competition. If she's good enough there's a chance she could win a scholarship to college, which would be massive for her and her family.\n\nI get that you had to make a choice, and I think it was the right one, but you've been TA in the way you've gone about it and your opinion of her.", "YTA for thinking skipping one tournament is an easy no brainer. Not sure about your cousin's team, but in many team sports there is lot of competition for each spot in the team. If the cousin gets replaced by someone and that person performs very well, then it could take a long time for the cousin to earn their spot back.", "YTA for keeping score and being petty.\nTell them they can't be part of the official ceremony and that you understand and you will love to see them at reception.", "YTA. she\u2019s a kid and her tournament with her team is much more important than lighting candles at your wedding!  I\u2019m having a hard time wrapping my head around you being so hurt a teenager is choosing her team, her friends, and her sport over your wedding. \n\nIf she couldn\u2019t be sure she could commit, then you\u2019re right to remove her from the wedding party and move on with your planning. \n\nYou\u2019re wrong about being so hurt by this and letting it out a wedge between your families. Your wedding is important to YOU. It is not important to a teenage cousin!!!  You should never have expected her to give up her tournament and abandon her teammates to light some candle!!!!", "YTA look, I love my nephew with all of my heart and would have loved him to be at my wedding. But, he made a commitment to his school band and I wanted a November wedding, when he has his biggest competition.

The girl and her mother should have been more realistic that there was no possible way to do both and voluntarily withdrawn from the wedding. That being said, you should respect the fact that not everyone is going to place the same value on your wedding as you do. In fact, almost no one is. The volleyball tournament is something she is directly involved in, and her presence or absence there could have a negative effect on her teammates, who she sees every single day. Whereas missing your wedding just means she's not in some photos she'll never look and doesn't get to light a candle.", "NYA bc she made the decision to go to the volleyball game so I wouldn\u2019t say you kicked her out of the wedding.

It's not really that consequential to be missing a close relative's wedding for.", "I disagree.  It\u2019s about priorities.  My guess, in five years, that tournament will have had zero impact on her college career, she won\u2019t remember the score, or who she was playing with, or any details and it won\u2019t determine her placement on the US National team.  In ten years, it will have zero impact on her career.   Was this a paid to play tournament (likely).  The youngest female Olympic volleyball player in the US team is 23 (beach), indoors was 19 and that was in 2000.  \n\nIf you look at the women\u2019s national team, they are all college grads, played some pro in another country, the tournaments they played in that they list as relevant, are national tournaments or international tournaments.  Those going to the 2024 Olympics, have already been chosen, are in there 20\u2019s, have been playing with the US National team, played in college, played pro in other countries, so I am 99.99% certain that this tournament will not place her cousin anywhere on the radar at 15.  It\u2019s absolutely unrealistic to expect that this one tournament would make or brake her VB career.  Just look at the types of tournaments that these women list as relevant on their profile.\n\nhttps://usavolleyball.org/story/qualified-u-s-women-punch-ticket-for-paris-2024/\n\nShe should have been at the wedding, she and her parents knew for months about the wedding, before signing up for that tournament.  Life is full of choices, she and her parents chose what is essentially an irrelevant event over a family wedding, likely due to an overinflated sense of relevance that this tournament would play in their daughter\u2019s life.  \n\nEveryone wants to believe that their little darling will be a pro one day, or on the Olympic team.  Guess what, if you ask any of those women on the National team if they ever missed a game or tournament, due to injury, family emergency, wedding, etc, they would all tell you yes.", "She said her cousin did commit to the wedding though, then said she had a volleyball game later. I don't think either are TA because they just need to do their own thing, but not committing to someone's wedding and leaving it on the fence until the last minute is kind of an asshole move.. Seems like you might be projecting a bit here.", "No relationship is severed. I just don\u2019t make them a priority as they haven\u2019t made me one or anyone in my family.\n\nI wish nothing bad to her or her parents and I\u2019m still close with her sister. We just don\u2019t do holidays as there are still hurt feelings.", "They might genuinely not know. It could be a question of \"If we're knocked out in the quarterfinals we can make it, if we get to the final there's no chance\". \n\nIf that's the case they should probably withdraw from an active role rather than leaving OP hanging.", "First of all, I did not shun the family. We are just not close. I do not make her or her games a priority as I felt the relationship was one sided. \n\nSecond of all she knew about the wedding before the game. And like I said the game was a pre season game. \n\nThird of all- she goes to a small school in a small town there is no \u201cmaking the team\u201d you sign up to play and your on the team", "So, the niece should have prioritized the commitment made first, correct? If so, the wedding commitment was made 7 months prior to the soccer game being scheduled, and 9 months prior to the date of the wedding. She was given 9 months notice for participating in the wedding and only 2 months for the tournament. She was asked to be in the wedding first and should have honored the prior commitment.", "Can some explain why a preseason game/tournament is important? She has the whole season to play, but chooses to miss a family members wedding? The family member that also didn\u2019t have to go to her games and cheer her on before. It\u2019s not ridiculous to be angry at someone for not supporting you in your big moments. It\u2019s a small game for her, but she\u2019s choosing to miss one of the biggest moments in some peoples lives.", "on the cheaper end my dress cost $300 + alterations. I donated it a year later, I too would rather pick a sport over that again. Nevermind hair+Make up, shoes. So to get ready for the wedding it cost me nearly $500 of which I didn't have at the time. Another $60 for a wedding present later that summer. Weddings are expensive even if your not the couple getting married. I wish more people would understand that. Especially in todays market.", "Keep in mind her cousins dresses matches the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. OP didn\u2019t say what that cost was. It\u2019s lovely to be asked to be in a wedding. Having to shell out extra for a role like her cousins may\u2019ve been the deciding factor to missing the ceremony.", "I'm sure she won't remember the score or the outcomes in 10 years.  But she will remember the time and special moments with her friends on the team.  Tournaments are a good way for teammates to bond.  My daughters have all been on teams, both school and club. They cherish their memories and have made friends. They are still in contact with some teammates even 6 years later.  For a 16 year old friends are more influential than cousins so much older than them. \n\nPlus OP keeps saying the families aren't that close, so why is it so important that a cousin she doesn't want to participate in her wedding. I'm sure if they were closer, she would find the wedding important. But I question how close her claim that they weren't that close.  She stated she attended many of her cousin's tournaments and games.  Usually people only make that commitment for people they feel a close relationship.\n\nWhen I was 15 I did not attend my cousin's wedding because I preffered to go to a swim meet. Swimming wasn't even my first sport, I just loved the big meets and hanging out with my friends. I'm sure my cousin didn't even miss me.", "No. She was already committed to play volleyball. That's a prior commitment", "Why did you need to kick her out? Why couldn't you approach it as, \"If you can be there, you'll have a part, and if you can't, someone else can light the candle\"? This isn't like a production of Romeo and Juliet where if Mercutio can't show up for the performance it's a big deal. Your older cousin could have lit the candle alone, or for that matter, you didn't even need the candle. \n\nHonor attendants aren't even a necessity for a wedding, which really only needs the two people getting married and an officiant. There's a historical reason for the honor attendants, but things like \"person who will read 1 Corinthians\" and \"person who will light candles\" and \"person who will stand by the guest book\" were invented to create roles that people the couple want to recognize could fill. \n\nYou were petty. You are continuing to be petty. And you have created a rift between the only other people in your family of your generation. \n\nLet me tell you, I am 57, and everyone from my grandparents' generation is dead. My mother, her cousin, and my father's sister and brother-in-law are the only people older than my generation still alive. I have a sister and a cousin who has three children. When I got bat mitvahed, the reception was full of grandparents and great aunts and second cousins, and it was wonderful. And there won't be any more events like that in our family.\n\nIf your family was actually toxic, I would have no problem telling you that you could cut them off if you wanted to. I haven't spoken to my mother in three years. But just from the story, they're not coming off as toxic. You're just butt hurt.", "Maybe they were worried you'd be an entitled jerk about it.", "Respectfully, I think you overestimate how much anyone besides the bride and groom care about a wedding. Most people really don't. It's harsh but it's the truth. It sounds as if this incident caused a huge family feud and for that, YTA. She's a high schooler. Maybe she made a thoughtless decision, but hey, that comes with being 16.", ">We just don\u2019t do holidays as there are still hurt feelings.\n\n>No relationship is severed.\n\nWell that seems like a severed relationship to me...\n\nWho's the one with hurt feelings? You? Because a child picked her sport over a boring wedding?", "> We just don\u2019t do holidays as there are still hurt feelings.\n\nTime to grow the rest of the way up and get over it.", "Oh FFS. I did HS sports, as did my nieces and nephews. There is no way in hell I would have asked any of them to prioritize my wedding over their sport, because it's not just about them, and I'm not going to be why they ended up on the wrong side of their coach. YTA", "None of that negates her commitment. In fact, on a small team, her commitment is even more important. I'm curious, are you arguing with every YTA take, and if so, why did you come to a place where that might happen and ask? You could have just been happily certain that you were right, all on your lonesome.\n\n\"Now our families are not very close since everything happened. We haven't even done holidays together.\" I'm seeing a 'since everything happened' there.", "Relationship was one sided? Yeah she\u2019s 16 ffs what else do you expect", "She's a child who signed up for school sports which means going to tournaments and who would suffer social repercussions at school. Might not seem like a big deal to adults, but it would be to a kid. The OP is an adult whose wedding didn't hinge on her niece. Being disappointed is one thing, but she should have been able to understand the kid's situation and gone on with good grace.", "> So, the niece should have prioritized the commitment made first, correct?\n\nNot correct. That\u2019s not how things work at all \u2014 people rejig their schedules all the time based on their priorities, as events come up. The cousin should have been clearer about dropping out, but reserving her participation months in advance doesn\u2019t actually make OP\u2019s wedding a more important event to her than something she\u2019s significantly involved with.", "BUT if she signed up for the team first, then her first commitment was technically the tourney", "IDK. It all kinda blends in 10-15 years after, heck even 2 or 3 years after. Missing 1 tournament isn't going to make you lose that friendship with your teammates. Coming from someone who also did a lot of club sports and tournaments. Although OP is NTA for kicking the cousin out, she is for holding a grudge on a 16 year old.", "That doesn't  make sense as she was asked to be in the wedding months  before the tournament \ud83d\ude44", "That\u2019s so shitty coming, especially from a family.", "And they would have been correct.", "Why does it hurt that a cousin you say you aren't close with didn't want to participate in your wedding?", "It sounds as if OP started a big family feud. It's so dumb. Wedding culture is so toxic. It's as if brides care more about having \"their special day\" than ... their loved ones or family.", "That and there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019d be benched for skipping the tournament\u2026.coach would see it as not committed to the team.", "Yeah, the fact that this sparked a family feud is ridiculous. The niece is just a child.", "Nope just giving you all the facts. And just because I say we aren\u2019t very close and don\u2019t celebrate together does not mean they\u2019re shuned.\n\nIf we see each other I say hi i I\u2019m polite. I don\u2019t wish her ill will. I just keep my distance.", "She\u2019s willing to miss school games for club soccer, so she clearly doesn\u2019t face repercussions for missing during the season, an off season tournament is less important than an in-season game.", "Is your cousin hoping for a sports scholarship, to college?  It sounds like that's what she's after. I can't fault her, for that. It sounds like she is fully committed to the team.\n\nLetting it mess up your relationship, would make you T. A. She's 16.  You are almost 30. Be an adult.  Just tell her you're sorry you can't save a spot, but, wish her luck, at the tourney, and hope she can make the reception.\n\nNAH", "She's 16. 16 year olds still have to figure out how not to be flaky. I understand that you decided that under the circumstances she could only be a guest, not a wedding party member. But going beyond that, holding a grudge, forgetting that *you're* the mature and grownup one here, would be wildly childish on your part. You take her out of the wedding party and make sure everything is fine - no drama.", "But she was already on the volleyball team, hence Connie's to it. I played soccer in high school and almost nothing would have taken precedence over a tournament.", ">If we see each other I say hi i I\u2019m polite. I don\u2019t wish her ill will. I just keep my distance.\n\nYou realize you're holding such a huge grudge against a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID right? Have some perspective.", "You forgot a word.  You\u2019re not close\u2026ANYMORE.\n\nBecause you\u2019re acting more like a child than the actual child in this situation.\n\nYou stated, rather clearly, that you went to a lot of her games before you got all huffy at her.  People who aren\u2019t close don\u2019t go to their volleyball games.", "Your niece is more mature than you are", "In a head to head maturity battle, the OP really shouldn't be neck and neck with a 16 year old, regardless of how much parsing goes on to make it all the child's fault, lol."]}
