But as time went on it wasn't a question of if she would make the tournament it was a question of if she would like the wedding.

I didn't want someone in my wedding party who wasn't full on committed to being there for me. I had gone to so many of my cousin's volleyball games where the day had been about her and this day my wedding I wanted it to be about me and my now husband.

She committed then couldn't commit any more.  \n\nThe stuff about wanting a child to make a day about you, a 29 year old.  That's a little gross.  \n\nIs/was G still planning on participating in your wedding and skipping her sister's volleyball?", "NAH. But some advice: let this go. And stop keeping score with a 16 year old - you're more than a decade older than her", "NTA you really didn\u2019t have a choice. You can\u2019t be stressed out wondering if she\u2019s going to show up or not. Plus she\u2019ll need time to clean up. If she makes it for the ceremony, great! But you don\u2019t need the stress of wondering if you need to make changes to the ceremony the day of.", "> In my mind she was only in 10th grade so she still had two more years left to play in high school plus she plays club volleyball in the wintertime so missing one volleyball tournament should not be a big deal especially for something like a wedding!\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but...I'm guessing you've not been part of a team before.\n\nListen, your priority is your wedding - as it should be. Her priority is her team - as it should be.\n\n>I felt so hurt that it was even a question and not only that was hearing from my other cousin G that all she wanted to do was play volleyball and she couldn't care less about the wedding.\n\nI'm sorry you're hurt but you are circling Entitled AH Island with this line of reasoning. \n\nThe fact is, while your cousin wants to be there, she didn't absolutely commit probably she had to wait to see what the volleyball schedule would be in order to be able to commit (or not) to your wedding.\n\nYou are right in asking her to step down. You are wrong to expect her to ditch her team for your wedding. She has a prior commitment to her team and she is honoring it as any committed athlete would and should.\n\nNAH, unless you get shitty with her about it.", "NTA. It's your wedding day and you had every right to expect full commitment from your cousin. It's understandable that you were hurt by her lack of enthusiasm and prioritization of volleyball over your special day.", "YTA for holding a grudge against a child. Shes in high school. Sports mean a lot to her, just as your wedding means a lot to you. Sure, kick her out of your wedding, but to sever relations is childish.", "NTA. You needed a commitment which was perfectly understandable. Also, you didn't freak out the first time you heard about the tournament - you waited for her to decide until the point at which you absolutely had to know.  And of course hearing from someone else that she didn't care about being in your wedding was hurtful.  I'd drop that family as well.", "Yta for being upset a 16 year old wouldn\u2019t drop everything for your wedding. She\u2019s a kid, of course she cares more about volley ball than her cousins wedding.", "NTA.... Look, I can understand that your wedding probably isn't a huge thing to a 16-year-old, but your aunt is an adult and she should be teaching her daughter to honor her commitments (since she said \"yes\" to being in your wedding before she knew there was a volleyball tournament). And you didn't even kick her out... she refused to commit, so obviously, you had to make a final decision.\n\nThat said, I think you'll be happier in the long run if you can forgive your cousin and move on and work to reconcile and be close again. And then again, maybe not....", "NAH. She's 16.", "ESH - fine for you to ask her to step down. Not fine for your attitude on how she has years to play volleyball etc. Her priorities don\u2019t have to align with yours. Their unwillingness to give you a direct answer is really shitty though, and they can\u2019t expect you to hold a spot just in case.", "NTA. Makes a difference that this was preseason, and not crucial. I'm actually calling her mom the AH here for not forcing her to honor the prior commitment, cause let's face it, 16 year olds are dumb.", "Not being in the wedding doesn\u2019t affect nearly as many people as skipping a tournament would have.

If cousin cannot prioritize your special day she does not deserve to be in the wedding party. \n\nYour cousin should have called you and said she is stepping back from the wedding party and would try to make it as a guest. Your Aunt, as an adult should have made sure she did that because it is respect to not leave you hanging like this. \n\nThis is not a you problem it is on them because their dismissiveness is rude.", "I had asked them to make a decision and when they couldn't give me an answer, I kicked her out. \n\nG did come and she did participate in the wedding. She tried to stay as neutral as she could but she did agree with me that the wedding came first so should have been the commitment.", "I have played sports. I did in high school and College. So I very much understand her commitment to her team. \n\nShe actually committed to being in my wedding before the tournament came about. She committed to my wedding in September. This tournament came out in June 7 months after I had asked and two months before my wedding. \n\nI am not cruel to her or anyone else. I just have chosen to not make them a priority in my life anymore.", "Yes, exactly. Of course the 16-year-old wanted to do the tournament. Her mother should've stepped in and told her she has to honor her commitment she already made.", " This is also something my mom said. Also forgot to add. My Aunt told me in a text during the work day rather then in person.", "Them not giving you an answer IS an answer.  They're choice was commit or don't.  They didn't commit.\n\nSo you are NTA for \"kicking her out\" because her, and maybe her mom, made the decision for you IMO.  \n\nBut again, she is a child.  The adult cousin acted reasonably.  I'd repair with the child.", ">I just have chosen to not make them a priority in my life anymore.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with this. And I am sorry you were hurt by her decision.\n\nIs this a new team she's on? Or is it the same team from the previous year? I'm just curious. It would make more sense to me if it's the same team she's been on since freshman year and that her loyalties would like with them.", ">I just have chosen to not make them a priority in my life anymore.\n\nThis is vengeful and cruel. YTA. You will come to regret this later on.", "yes she played on this team her freshman year. But I should add this is a pre-season tournament the coach decided to enter and did not impact their season going forward. \n\nAnd like I said she also plays on a club team that travels around the United States and if this team has a game she chooses that team over her high school team.", "Lol no it's not", "And She won't regret it either"]}
