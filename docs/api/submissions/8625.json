NTA", "ESH. She has the right to do what she wants for a living, but needs to realize what comes with the territory when you are sexually flaunting yourself to the world. \u200bYou're also the asshole because she's family and even though you don't agree with her, you should try to be more understanding and at least calmly try to explain why it happens. If she doesn't get it then I'd just drop it. Calling her a whore and making fun of her is going to get things nowhere.", "YTA for calling her names. Instead you could have had a chat with her about her feelings and what she expects in her comments section with the specific content of her posts. Would have been a chance for both of you to share, learn and grow.\n\nInstead you made her feel small, invalidated and worthless.", "NTA.

She\u2019s literally asking for it (with her photo captions) whereas the other women are not.", "Soft YTA, because what you say is true in spirit. If she dresses in an intentionally revealing manner and posts \u201chow do I look\u201d it\u2019s irrational of her to feel offended or preyed upon when someone says \u201cyou look hot.\u201d\n\nHowever, calling her a wh*ore is uncalled for. She *isn\u2019t* a whore for dressing the way she does and making money (or trying to). Sex work is legitimate work. You should have said that the conversation was about unprovoked sexual commentary, and you believe she is inviting the commentary - there is a huge difference as she is somewhat consenting to the commentary. If she posted on her personal insta in a cute dress just because she was out that day and someone said like, nice tits - *that* would be a problem. But her actions are intentional to get likes/followers. There is a better way to communicate that than calling her a whore.", "NTA, but maybe you shouldnt have called her a whore in your response.", "NTA.  \nYou don't get to put yourself up on a cross and cry \"Look what they did to me!\"", "NTA. She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it too. The name calling may have been uncalled for, but hey, the truth hurts.", "YTA. Maybe this meeting has opened her eyes to how damaging some of the attention is that she receiving online is. Instead of focusing on her discomfort and trying to have a supportive dialog surrounding her online interactions, you took the opportunity to put her down and call her names.", "NTA\n\nSex sells by any gender. Being sexually harassed by a gender isn\u2019t anywhere comparable. I\u2019m purposefully remaining gender neutral as it goes both ways.", "ESH. I think you messed up an opportunity to have a really important conversation with your sister about how her words could have impacted the other woman in your group. \n\nYour sister\u2019s response shows a troubling level lack of empathy and judgment. Not sure why she thinks low level comments about her appearance, made in response to her literally asking about her appearance, are comparable or give her any insight into the experience of someone being sexually harassed by a family member.", "NTA", "Went to a women's group to slut shame and insult your own sister?

She chooses to **ask** for those comments and thus is not allowed to complain about them. You are right, they are paying her bills, she is doing it willingly, and she knows what she is doing. She is not a victim.", "NTA. Woman being objectified for existing is in no way comparable to your sister turning herself into an object to sell. She doesn't get to  use her body as an object to sell herself then play victim. She is free to do what she likes but she is quite literally asking for it with her comments.", "NTA- lol by all means keep on calling her that", "YTA. I understand your frustration with your sister however, I think you need to consider your biases. It seems as if you disdain your sister for quitting college and pursuing a modeling career. The internal misogyny is insidious and needs to be checked. Does your sister's career choices embarrass you? Is she not earning enough money to pay for her bills? I wonder if you had read the comments she was talking about or you paraphrased what she actually *said*?", "NTA. I don't know what else to call those kinds of 'influencers' - she sounds like she's one step from onlyfans. It's delusional to not realize it's almost sex work.

There are ways to get your point across without eviscerating your sister.", "Despite what she posts on social, it doesn\u2019t invalidate how creepy and forward men can be. Her experience is obviously different from others in the room but it doesn\u2019t make creeps less creepy.", "YTA\n\nYou literally said your sister was asking for it. I hate to break it to you, but no matter what a girl wears or doesn't wear, men are going to be creepy. The problem isn't your sister. The problem is how society has viewed women and how men think they can do what they want.", "YTA for sure. You called your sister a whore. What?!?", "YTA. You\u2019re trying to justify creepy men\u2019s actions by blaming it on her. No woman deserves to feel harassed, no matter what they do for a living.", "YTA. It\u2019s fair to say that dressing a certain way will get you a certain kind of attention. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t walk through a dark alley at night. I\u2019m responsible for my emotional and physical safety. No one should be talked to that way but I do think that we can take steps to protect ourselves.

I get where you\u2019re coming from, truly\u2014she IS putting herself in a position where she\u2019s going to get a lot of these comments, you\u2019re correct. She was also tone deaf in when/where she decided to share her concerns. \n\nHOWEVER it sounds like you took this as an opportunity to shit on her rather than help her sort through those feelings. Let\u2019s give her the benefit of the doubt and say she is truly uncomfortable with some comments she\u2019s getting: is what you said helpful? No. Even if she was playing up the discomfort to fit in at that women\u2019s group, there are definitely things she needs to unpack. There\u2019s a lot to navigate as a women who uses her looks and body to make a living. You had an opportunity to help her unpack her choices and feelings, and instead you used that as a chance to literally call her a whore. That\u2019s not a good look.", "Ok NTA. \n\nLet's not pretend like dancing around in a bikini or lingerie and asking how you look because you know men will give you attention and compliments is even remotely the same as being sexually harassed randomly, let alone by family. \n\n**Idk why we all pretend like some girls don't use social media for sexual attention to make money from that attention. Sex work.** \n\nWe aren't shocked when men at strip clubs are oogling women or complimenting their sexual nature. Being objectified isn't the same as signing up for something. It's like going out of your way to ask for something, getting it, then complaining...?", "As you mature you will learn the wisdom of asking yourself these questions before contributing this type of opinion:\n\nIs it true?\n\nIs it kind?\n\nDoes it need to be said by me?\n\nYou failed at least 2/3 here so YTA", "Yes it was inconsiderate to call her that.\n\nRegardless of what she does or chooses to do in future, it will always be rude to say that. \n\nThe one thing you are correct on is seeing the problem with your sister trying to compare what she sees in her comments to literal sexual harassment/assault by a family member, given the clothing (or lack of clothing) she intentionally wears to get attention. I have to be careful that I'm not just giving the \"well she's asking for it\" or \"if she didn't dress like that, she wouldn't get objectified\" excuses here, but I hope you understand what I mean.", "NTA", "Hahahahahahaha", ">your sister wasn't hurting anyone by voicing her thoughts.\n\nPlease.

As for my sister, she is exploiting the very system that exploits women's bodies. And then complains when people compliment her looks? Not even creepy DMs, which is understandable to be mad about. \n\nBut she literally said to the group that she's upset when guys in her insta focus on complimenting her body when all she posts are lingerie pics with suggestive captions like \"i think pink looks good on my \\*peach emoji, do you?\" She is doing these things with the intention of gaining clout and money through horny and sleazy guys who want to see naked women.", "Nah.  The lady who humiliated her boyfriend with her friends because she was \"more intelligent\" or the guy who humiliated his girlfriend over an expensive gift/his ego was way worse. Lol", ">you disdain your sister for quitting college and pursuing a modeling career\n\nI don't disdain or resent her choice, I just disdain the fact she thought her so called \"objectification\" was at all comparable to the girl being harassed. She's been doing this career for the past year, and I've never criticized her before because it is her choice. Even though, I do think her career choice encourages a culture of commodification of women's bodies, I don't think that takes away her right or autonomy to make personal decisions.", "Yeah, I shouldn't have said that word.", "Eviscerate? Do you even know what that means?\n\nBecause that word is much too strong to describe what was one little insult.", "She explicitly complained about guys calling her hot and pretty on insta lingerie pics. Not about weird DMs or nasty comments. How is that creepy??", "I disagree.   She is sexually objecting herself.   Did you read all of her post?  She's using her body to get money.   No judgment.  It is her life, but you wouldn't say the same thing to a stripper.  It's just a fact.", "I don't understand how my sister can get mad at guys commenting \"omg you're so hot and pretty\" when she posts lingerie pictures on insta with a \"how do i look\" caption with heart and winking emojis. \n\nShe literally is asking for it. I don't mean creepy and sleazy DMs which are unacceptable, but what she complained about was comments on her insta focusing on her beauty and body, when all she posts on there are lingerie pics.", "How are guys in her comments calling her hot and pretty (which is specifically what she referenced) being creepy? She literally asks \"how do i look\" in her captions with heart eye emojis and winking emojis, she is asking for their opinion.\n\nI understand if she felt creeped out about nasty DMs, but that's not what she complained about.", ">There\u2019s a lot to navigate as a women who uses her looks and body to make a living\n\nI think that is her choice to do so. But I don't get how she complains about the very reaction (comments about her beauty=more followers for her body) she is trying to produce. She is using her body for profit, and perpetuating the very culture of objectification, so I don't see how she can compare that to a girl who is sexualized by her uncle.", "Yeah, my choice of words was too hurtful. But I think my sentiment stands true.", "I think you were right for calling her out, but you could do it in a less insulting matter. She is literally asking for it by posting these things online. So either do it and don't complain about it, or don't do it at all, simple as that.", "That's what I mean. A stripper doesn't deserve to have guys touching her and being extremely creepy and invasive. But if she puts on a show with the intention of making money, and a guy says she's \"hot\" (which are the comments my sister complains about,) how can she think that constitutes unfair objectification?", "Then maybe have an adult discussion with her about it without s\\*utshaming her?", "You can just ask her to explain it to you.", "If you haven\u2019t already noticed how men act in the comment section of women\u2019s TikToks (and I mean, any kind of TikTok at all, sexual or not), I can guarantee you that \u201cYou\u2019re pretty!\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re hot!\u201d are just scraping the surface of the comments she is receiving. It isn\u2019t just DMs where a lot of men feel comfortable enough to say the grossest things.", "The problem here is that there are significantly more gentle and tactful ways to point out the difference in scenarios/circumstances between a woman or young girl being objectified for simply existing and a woman being objectified for deliberately encouraging that kind of attention. \n\nThat being said, you must also keep in mind that, while your sister perhaps should not have compared her situation to the others', her feelings are still valid. She can willingly use her looks/body to garner more views, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't resent that fact. Maybe she felt like that was the only choice she had if she wanted to get views and revenue as a female influencer, for instance. \n\nIt is fine to tactfully point out the disparity between your sister's situation and the other young woman's, but keep in mind that nobody wins the Suffering Olympics. Just because the young woman being harassed by her uncle is suffering \"more\" does not automatically mean that your sister is not also suffering, or that her complaints are not valid.", "That\u2019s why I went with ESH\u2014as I said, very tone deaf on her part. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean her line of work is something she\u2019s totally confident and comfortable in navigating, and that\u2019s where you fell short. She needs to figure out if she\u2019s truly comfortable with this, and own it if that\u2019s the case; if she\u2019s NOT truly comfortable with this, she needs to understand why she\u2019s engaging in this behavior. Maybe she needs to get out. Being called a whore is unhelpful, unkind, and reductive. If you love her, do better by her and help her (or at the very least, be kind in your criticism).", "Again have you talked to your sister like an adult about stuff?", "Don't you know OP, girls can do no wrong...", "She explicitly complained about comments saying she's \"hot and pretty.\" She said she wants them not to focus on her body on her lingerie posts.", "Lmao you\u2019re making shit up while op is giving a direct quote from the person that was \u201cobjectified\u201d. Quit reaching so damn hard when you know it ain\u2019t true and you weren\u2019t there. Actually listen to the person that was there and knows the situation rather than your own delusions or else what\u2019s the point in reading their post.", ">She can willingly use her looks/body to garner more views, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't resent that fact. Maybe she felt like that was the only choice she had if she wanted to get views and revenue as a female influencer, for instance.\n\nThat's bullshit. Suggesting that women can't be successful content creators without sexualizing themselves is extremely regressive. A lot of the best women I see on TikTok do art, comedy, day in the life vids, and all sorts of stuff in between.", "I don't know what there is to say to her. I apologized for calling her a whore, that's it. I just think in the larger context that she is a bit delusional for thinking she is being objectified on insta with her lingerie pics.", "She isn't acting like an adult so I doubt it", ">Suggesting that women can't be successful content creators without sexualizing themselves is extremely regressive.\n\nIsn't what you did too regressive?", "I'd appreciate it if you actually read my comment instead of jumping to baseless conclusions and putting words in my mouth, thanks. \n\nPlease reread what I wrote, which was not \"Women can't be successful content creators without sexualizing themselves\". I would never believe, say, or imply anything of the sort. Which is why I did not, in fact, say that, and instead said that OP's sister *may have felt* that that was her only winning option. \n\nMaybe she wasn't getting the views and revenue she wanted with other content and couldn't figure out any other way to positively change things up. Maybe she was receiving those kinds of comments even on less provocative content and felt shoehorned into amping it up because that was the only/predominant interaction she was receiving. Maybe she genuinely wanted to create that sort of content and enjoys it but still resents the objectification. Maybe she's just a hypocrite and wanted to feel included in the conversation. I don't know, and neither do you. It's all just speculation.", "\"Sister can you help me understand something. From my view, you use your body to make money. That is your choice and while i support it, I do feel that because you do that, it does invite that unwanted attention. How do you handle it and does it bother you?\"", "Yeah, I apologized to her for using that word. But my sentiment is not regressive.", "How is the attention of guys calling her hot unwanted?? She intentionally presents herself that way because that is what will get her clout, and help pay her bills.", "Classic Reddit. lmao", "I mean you're not even willing to sit down and hear your sister's side. You jumped straight into shaming her. You don't have to agree with her view, but maybe instead of insulting her and calling her names, you take a moment to just listen?", "You really have no interest in actually sitting down and understanding your sister's point of view do you?", "And yet you're still here.", "Humor me, what possibly would be a good justification for complaining about guys commenting that you're hot on lingerie pics that you caption with \"how do i look \\*heart emoji \\*winking emoji?\"", "Why don't you ask your sister and find out genius?"]}
