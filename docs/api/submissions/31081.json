Also remember a lot of refugees stories about how important, wealthy and educated are just stories.", "NTA. It might be the wake-up call he needs to burst his bubble of unrealistic thinking. I have worked with the integration of refugees for thirty years, not in the US or in an English speaking country, and I have met many with the mindset you are describing. I used to cut them some slack, thinking it must be *so* hard to face the fact that you are starting at the bottom rung of the ladder after having lead a privileged life where you came from. I have had the added problem of people, who spoke English and didn't want to bother with the language in my country for that reason. Since most of my compatriots speak some English, they thought it was the lingua franca. It is not.\n\nIt could take very, very long to make them understand that without the language, there would be no job, not to mention no admission to any education, least of all university. Some still don't get it. It can lead to depression, drug abuse, dysfunction in the family. Any problem you can think of really. First a refugee is over the moon, because he managed to save his life. When the honey moon phase of that sensation has passed, he has to face the challenges of living in a new country, where things are done very differently, and where he is not likely to reach anywhere near the prestige and status of his life in his home country before the troubles began, he may even face racism. The rest of us need to have at least some compassion without coddling such people. Realistic expectations are very important.", "NTA. You did him a favor because he\u2019s not going to get very far with that attitude.", "NTA\n\nA reality check every now and then isn't bad, but I guess he didn't take it well given your description of him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You already spent to much emotional time of yours.", "It's either stories, or he was set up with a nothing job through familial connections or something. The fact that he doesn't seem to even identify the specific skillsets or training that he'd bring to a specific office role is pretty much an admission that he doesn't have much to offer. He just wants the trappings of a fancy job. Not the responsibilities.\n\nAll jobs require skills. Lower paying jobs, even when you're just having to do simple physical work, requires the ability to follow instructions and work well with others.\n\nAnd if you're a refugee or a recent immigrant, without a strong command of English, the workforce is difficult to break into, even if you're highly qualified, skilled, charismatic and humble.\n\nIf youre the opposite of all those things, like this gentleman, you're not getting anywhere.", "He told me that he spends most of his time sleeping in his office or plays Xbox lmao. I understand that a lot of office jobs have a downtime but this guy was 100% connected. But he\u2019s really progressive tho, so there\u2019s that"]}
