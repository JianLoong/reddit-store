I have worked with the integration of refugees for thirty years, not in the US or in an English speaking country, and I have met many with the mindset you are describing.

I have had the added problem of people, who spoke English and didn't want to bother with the language in my country for that reason. Since most of my compatriots speak some English, they thought it was the lingua franca. It is not.\n\nIt could take very, very long to make them understand that without the language, there would be no job, not to mention no admission to any education, least of all university. Some still don't get it. It can lead to depression, drug abuse, dysfunction in the family. Any problem you can think of really. First a refugee is over the moon, because he managed to save his life. When the honey moon phase of that sensation has passed, he has to face the challenges of living in a new country, where things are done very differently, and where he is not likely to reach anywhere near the prestige and status of his life in his home country before the troubles began, he may even face racism.

And on top of that having to learn a completely new language. Those night classes you suggest he take? How long do you think that\u2019s going to take to get through all of the prerequisite classes, then all of the college classes?  Plus, he\u2019s not going to be able to be successful at those classes until he comes pretty close to mastering English. \n\n\nI\u2019ll say he\u2019s also an AH since he is looking down on blue collar jobs.

He's implying that because his coworker is from Afghanistan, he doesn't have the equivalent of a high school education.  This guy clearly has some education if he was in the sort of position OP talked about- if you dismiss everything he had as a result of corruption or nepotism without evidence, that's being discriminatory.\n\nI've been an ESL teacher for 11 years now, and I've worked with refugees before- in fact right now we've got two families from Syria who enrolled at my Elementary school this year.  In my experience, they're super-happy to be here and super-eager to learn English.  But you can't at all judge their \\*level of education\\* based on their English skills.  A lot of doctors, lawyers, engineers end up being refugees.  The idea that this guy wants to go directly into an associates'  or bachelor's degree program is, in my experience, actually completely normal and not at all strange.  Tons of colleges have ESL programs and make accommodations for students who aren't yet fluent in English.", "Being a progressive Afghani is probably the reason he is here instead of there - the Taliban didn't look too kindly upon people like that. Frankly, a huge reason why they continue to be supported by the Afghani people and the reason they are back in power is due to anger and frustration with the immense corruption and arrogance of individuals like your coworkers.\n\nTL;DR, he didn't move here because he was progressive, he moved here because the alternative was being thrown out of a building for apparent corruption and greed after the government changed, I would guess. Assuming he is even telling you the truth and isn't full of it.", "He'll eventually find a slot as a diversity hire until he fucks it up enough to get fired.", "He can\u2019t take a lot of university programs without pre requisites, that\u2019s why I told him to go to night school.", "This dude probably comitted a capital crime in the Taliban's mind by letting little girls read.", "Idk where you\u2019re from but even \u201cdiversity hires\u201d require the candidate to meet the requirements.", "That's fair!  But oftentimes a university will work with a student to see what it is they already know.  Given that he's a refugee, I think it's likely that he \\*has\\* those prerequisites, but he can't prove it- he has the experience but doesn't have the documentation.  If he's serious about a university education, the first thing he needs to do is sit down with an admissions counselor from a local community college and work with them to determine what education he can prove he has, and what he needs to do first, rather than jumping sight unseen into adult education high school courses that might be a big fat waste of his time if he already knows the material.\n\nFalling into the trap of assuming that someone without any English skills is stupid is all too easy a mistake to make.  I still have to police myself about it, and as I said I have a ton of experience with ESL speakers.  Because speaking with someone who's still learning English means you use a lot of simplified language, it's natural to assume that means a lot of simplified thought as well.    Natural but wrong.\n\nAll the other things you've mentioned about this guy paint him as a tier 1 lazy asshole who expects the world to serve him.  You get those in every country.  And it could very well be the case that he legitimately lacks a basic education.  But I don't necessarily think it's proven that that's the case, and until it is, I think it's a dick move to assume that he's uneducated rather than educated but unable to prove it.", ">told him that being humble and not looking down on working people is part of American culture\n\nIt is?", "NTA obviously.

But the simple fact is his expectations and what he is qualified for are worlds apart. And looking down on others is never a good look.

India was a HUGE eye opener for me when I saw how people I (used to) respect treated people they felt were beneath them when given any power at all over them.

That may make it hard for him to get most jobs but it doesn\u2019t make him uneducated. Yes, he will likely need ESL classes to get office jobs etc but if he was highly educated on Afghanistan, he\u2019s highly educated in America. Just in a different language.", "He\u2019s not downgrading his intelligence. The fact is, regardless of what skills and experience he has, he has basically no chance of getting the kind of job he apparently feels like he deserves if he doesn\u2019t at minimum gain more competence in English. \n\nAnd yes English is hard, but I disagree with your statement about people born in the US. If you\u2019re talking about those born to parents who don\u2019t speak English, the vast majority of those people obtain at least a basic to moderate grasp of the language. If they\u2019re in school or interacting with people outside of their family and culture, kids do a good job of picking up what they need to. They may not always reach what would be expected of a typical native speaker, but if they\u2019re immersed in English they tend to do well enough to get by. \n\nIf you\u2019re talking about how most people don\u2019t follow all the rules of \u201cstandard American (or anywhere else) English\u201d, then that\u2019s just flawed. Almost all of those people can communicate more than well enough to understand and make themselves understood. Just because they don\u2019t conform to the  standard doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have competency in English. A language standard is a compromise between a huge number of spoken forms and the majority of native speakers aren\u2019t going to always speak like that or even have knowledge of all the rules of their own language. \n\nI agree OP was a bit too flippant and acted like what this guy has to do to get where he wants is way simpler than it is likely to be, but he was also being very rude and your criticism of him saying he needs to improve his English first is just not reasonable on basically any grounds.", "I think, at least where I am from, that Americans are taught to respect the working class in the way that they are to treat them with courtesy and to have an awareness that the work they do is necessary and important.\n\nAmericans are also taught that they must have a useful degree to be a success. So they may believe that the work that plumbers and sanitation workers do is the most important in the city but most would never strive to be either because they see it as something anyone can do.\n\nThey also fail to recognize that all people deserve good pay and working conditions. So there is an outer respect for the work that they do but it doesn't go so far as valuing them. So we treat our workers as if they are replaceable but don't you dare talk bad about them!
