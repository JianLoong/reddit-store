Also remember a lot of refugees stories about how important, wealthy and educated are just stories.", "NTA. It might be the wake-up call he needs to burst his bubble of unrealistic thinking. I have worked with the integration of refugees for thirty years, not in the US or in an English speaking country, and I have met many with the mindset you are describing. I used to cut them some slack, thinking it must be *so* hard to face the fact that you are starting at the bottom rung of the ladder after having lead a privileged life where you came from. I have had the added problem of people, who spoke English and didn't want to bother with the language in my country for that reason. Since most of my compatriots speak some English, they thought it was the lingua franca. It is not.\n\nIt could take very, very long to make them understand that without the language, there would be no job, not to mention no admission to any education, least of all university. Some still don't get it. It can lead to depression, drug abuse, dysfunction in the family. Any problem you can think of really. First a refugee is over the moon, because he managed to save his life. When the honey moon phase of that sensation has passed, he has to face the challenges of living in a new country, where things are done very differently, and where he is not likely to reach anywhere near the prestige and status of his life in his home country before the troubles began, he may even face racism. The rest of us need to have at least some compassion without coddling such people. Realistic expectations are very important.", "NTA. You did him a favor because he\u2019s not going to get very far with that attitude.", "NTA\n\nA reality check every now and then isn't bad, but I guess he didn't take it well given your description of him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some people have trouble when migrating and can fall into a negative mindset like that, and he needed to hear that.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, there are individuals here and other countries that you will never be able to get through. We DO have a different way. So many come to our country for the \u201cdream life\u201d. Then when they get here they\u2019re shocked at what they have to do to \u201cwork\u201d at it. Let him be. You already spent to much emotional time of yours.", "It's either stories, or he was set up with a nothing job through familial connections or something. The fact that he doesn't seem to even identify the specific skillsets or training that he'd bring to a specific office role is pretty much an admission that he doesn't have much to offer. He just wants the trappings of a fancy job. Not the responsibilities.\n\nAll jobs require skills. Lower paying jobs, even when you're just having to do simple physical work, requires the ability to follow instructions and work well with others.\n\nAnd if you're a refugee or a recent immigrant, without a strong command of English, the workforce is difficult to break into, even if you're highly qualified, skilled, charismatic and humble.\n\nIf youre the opposite of all those things, like this gentleman, you're not getting anywhere.", "He told me that he spends most of his time sleeping in his office or plays Xbox lmao. I understand that a lot of office jobs have a downtime but this guy was 100% connected. But he\u2019s really progressive tho, so there\u2019s that", "NTA. The guy needed to be humbled and reminded that he is not all that. And besides, you offered advice that would help him achieve his goal only for him to basically tell you to fuck off and let him complain.\n\nWhile I am ok with people complaining, if there isn't an effort being made to change your situation then all you are doing is whining like a brat.", "ESH.\n\nWhile I have no doubt that his attitude sucks, you're making the classic mistake of assuming that a lack of English skills means he's uneducated.", "NTA. If the guy was talking shit on my job while being my assistant I wouldn\u2019t have given him career advice, I just would have told him that he\u2019s an outside dog no matter how much he might feel like an inside dog.\n\nI\u2019m super curious whether he actually merited anything that he had in Afghanistan or if he just had the right family ties to have some of the juicy American rebuilding dollars thrown his way. One might expect that someone who went far in the field of education might be a little more open to learning, if he ever belonged there.", "NTA there hasn't been a functional education system in Afghanistan for almost 40 years and there's no higher educational system worth the name. I highly doubt he had the job he claims he had, or the staff. I mean... maids? How did he have maids? Women can't work there! Keep bursting his bubble. Maybe he'll accept reality one day.", "ESH\nYou are both being elitist in different ways. He is wrong for his assumptions and comments about blue collar employees. You are wrong to downgrade his intelligence because he hasn't learned English yet. English is hard. A lot of the people born in the US can't speak it properly. It sounds like you think you are better than him because you are American. Or perhaps you're just mad he insulted you and your work and you want to dis him back.\nAlso, being humble and not looking down on people is so NOT a part of American culture.", "\"I USED to be.\" \n\nSee that four-letter word \"used?\" It indicates that you are not one now. So stop acting like you still are. Do we need to have you checked into a hospital because you can't tell what reality is anymore?", "ESH. I understand he is annoying, but I suggest having compassion. Have you had much experience with refugees? Think about what it\u2019s like to have a career in your country and then be forced to flee and your previous job credentials now mean nothing. My neighbor across the street is a Syrian refugee. The husband was a doctor in Syria. He can\u2019t practice here.  Think of all of his schooling he went through and years and years of being a practicing doctor. He\u2019s now working the line in a factory. Imagine what that does to someone. He\u2019s in his late 50\u2019s I\u2019m guessing. You really expect him to start over to go thorough all that again? He\u2019d be late 60\u2019s by the time he was done.  And on top of that having to learn a completely new language. Those night classes you suggest he take? How long do you think that\u2019s going to take to get through all of the prerequisite classes, then all of the college classes?  Plus, he\u2019s not going to be able to be successful at those classes until he comes pretty close to mastering English. \n\n\nI\u2019ll say he\u2019s also an AH since he is looking down on blue collar jobs. Anyone that does that is an AH.", "NTA, you have explained that ESL classes and night school will be helpful.  It is very rough for immigrants who had good careers to start over again, sounds like he is really struggling and a  bit of an a\\*\\*.", "NTA but I'd go the other way with this and say well put yourself out there for those jobs! You have to go get'em pal! And then watch him promptly fall flat on his face each time when he either gets a no thanks or not even scheduled for an interview.", "I worked in restaurants and one of the older cooks had been a bank manager back home, but he and most of his village relocated to the US because of political violence.\n\nHe was highly educated and had excellent English, but relocating had made it challenging to get a white collar position. However, he never complained - it was worth it to live in safety.\n\nLanguage skills are often a barrier to work and you are not wrong to tell your coworker that classes could improve his longterm job prospects.\n\nHowever, there's the old adage, you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink.\n\nI do have sympathy though for someone whose life has been so changed by politics, war, and violence.", "/r/shitamericanssay", "My eyes could not have rolled harder lmao", "Truly a hysterical sentence, and I wonder if OP really believes it.", "I don't think he's making that assumption. The way I took it was that without a proper grasp of English, white-collar jobs are simply outside of his wheel house.", "He'a a refugee from Afghanistan. He's here because the Taliban will kill him and the U.S. abandoned him.", "Sure, but this dude is also talking about telling this guy to go to night school to get high school credit.  He's implying that because his coworker is from Afghanistan, he doesn't have the equivalent of a high school education.  This guy clearly has some education if he was in the sort of position OP talked about- if you dismiss everything he had as a result of corruption or nepotism without evidence, that's being discriminatory.\n\nI've been an ESL teacher for 11 years now, and I've worked with refugees before- in fact right now we've got two families from Syria who enrolled at my Elementary school this year.  In my experience, they're super-happy to be here and super-eager to learn English.  But you can't at all judge their \\*level of education\\* based on their English skills.  A lot of doctors, lawyers, engineers end up being refugees.  The idea that this guy wants to go directly into an associates'  or bachelor's degree program is, in my experience, actually completely normal and not at all strange.  Tons of colleges have ESL programs and make accommodations for students who aren't yet fluent in English.", "Being a progressive Afghani is probably the reason he is here instead of there - the Taliban didn't look too kindly upon people like that. Frankly, a huge reason why they continue to be supported by the Afghani people and the reason they are back in power is due to anger and frustration with the immense corruption and arrogance of individuals like your coworkers.\n\nTL;DR, he didn't move here because he was progressive, he moved here because the alternative was being thrown out of a building for apparent corruption and greed after the government changed, I would guess. Assuming he is even telling you the truth and isn't full of it.", "He'll eventually find a slot as a diversity hire until he fucks it up enough to get fired.", "He can\u2019t take a lot of university programs without pre requisites, that\u2019s why I told him to go to night school.", "This dude probably comitted a capital crime in the Taliban's mind by letting little girls read.", "Idk where you\u2019re from but even \u201cdiversity hires\u201d require the candidate to meet the requirements.", "That's fair!  But oftentimes a university will work with a student to see what it is they already know.  Given that he's a refugee, I think it's likely that he \\*has\\* those prerequisites, but he can't prove it- he has the experience but doesn't have the documentation.  If he's serious about a university education, the first thing he needs to do is sit down with an admissions counselor from a local community college and work with them to determine what education he can prove he has, and what he needs to do first, rather than jumping sight unseen into adult education high school courses that might be a big fat waste of his time if he already knows the material.\n\nFalling into the trap of assuming that someone without any English skills is stupid is all too easy a mistake to make.  I still have to police myself about it, and as I said I have a ton of experience with ESL speakers.  Because speaking with someone who's still learning English means you use a lot of simplified language, it's natural to assume that means a lot of simplified thought as well.    Natural but wrong.\n\nAll the other things you've mentioned about this guy paint him as a tier 1 lazy asshole who expects the world to serve him.  You get those in every country.  And it could very well be the case that he legitimately lacks a basic education.  But I don't necessarily think it's proven that that's the case, and until it is, I think it's a dick move to assume that he's uneducated rather than educated but unable to prove it."]}
