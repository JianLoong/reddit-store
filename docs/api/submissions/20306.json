She\u2019s still your mother and still has an opportunity to be a good parent to you in your adult life (I\u2019m an adult but still rely on my parents for many things).

As someone who was the drunken mess (not with kids but cats but man, I still feel horrible about being in active addiction... what a nightmare I was).. I hope she gets to the point where she gets help. I hope she remembers what you said and does something about it. I highly recommend recommend Al-Anon for you to go to.

She\u2019s doing this to yourself. Congrats for being honest with her. You need to take care of yourself. Don\u2019t let her manipulate you by setting boundaries with her.

Don't feel guilty.  The only way from here for you is up, and hopefully, your mother will decide that for herself as well and get the help she needs to get sober and stay that way.

I'm sorry things were so rough for you. You deserved better.\n\nAt this point, I'm assuming you're an adult. It's time to set a boundary with Mom here. She cannot be calling you like this when she's messed up on drugs and alcohol. It's not a kind thing to do and it's damaging to your current mental health.\n\nYou need to have an honest conversation with her while she's sober. Explain that you love her and want her to be happy. If she really cares about you now, she needs to stop putting you through this pain every time she calls you. Tell her that every time she calls you crying and drunk, she is continuing to hurt you. She has a choice. As her child, you are asking her not to do this anymore. Congratulations, you just set a boundary!\n\nThe next step is to add consequences for overstepping your boundary. If she does not change this behaviour, you will no longer answer her calls at all. DO NOT BACK DOWN. If you show her that you're not willing to follow through, she will continue to push as far as she can because she knows she can. If that happens, try a month (or whatever time feels reasonable to you) of complete no contact. When the set time is over, you can give her another try. If she fails that, next time it's 2 months of no contact. I hope you won't need to continue after that, but you can follow the same formula.\n\nShe has a choice. She's always had a choice. She is the one who put you in this situation that you're now stressed about dealing with.

It could almost definitely be subconscious -  but she gets messed up and caught up or creates bad situations, then phones the one person who will comfort her and tell her she did her best in life. \nIt's not your job to soothe her and talk her out of her current spirals.

I struggle with alcohol and drug use, but I never rope my kid into it. \n\nI understand that the trauma of becoming a young mother impacts us all differently, but having trauma does not give us a free pass to be bad parents or bad people. I hope this is the wake up call she needed and she gets help. Maybe you two can repair the relationship and heal together.

Your mom feels bad, but she doesn't feel badly enough to change behaviors that continue to hurt you. \n\nSpeaking as a mother of two adult children, you are NOT responsible for her emotional well being. I understand wanting to answer the phone to make sure she's not in the hospital or something, but you are not required to listen to her be belligerent or self pitying. She made her bed, you don't have to sleep in it anymore. \n\nShe IS a terrible mother. Mothering doesn't stop when your kids are grown, it just changes shape and scope. You spoke truth, which can be extremely painful. I'm sorry it hurts you as much as it hurts her. Continue to speak truth to her, and to yourself.

Her mind flinches from it and I'm sure she can come up with excuses, but it's pretty obvious that people who drink, take drugs, and abuse their kids to the point that they get taken away by the state are bad parents.  That's why she's drunkdialing you.  She feels bad about it and she wants reassurance that she wasn't as bad as she already knows she was.\n\nYou're allowed to acknowledge that to her.  \"I know you're sorry.

I\u2019m not saying she is calling you and lamenting her faults and mistakes with ill or manipulative intent, but whether she is or not, you\u2019re not responsible for the way she conducts herself; you\u2019re just responsible for you.

As someone who struggled with a similar situation it's really difficult on every end.  Of course you love your mother and wouldn't want to hurt her but she still hurt you.  It's good for you to vocalize your feelings because otherwise they just sit there and trust me,  you'll feel them later.  If you can have these open and honest discussions with your mom and she wants to listen and try to change, it's worth everything in the world.  If she apologizes and you accept that,  it would be best for you both to start fresh.  She was in a very unfortunate situation that led to your upbringing not being the best but now that you're grown all you can do is try to move past that with her, after you fully vocalize your feelings though.  \n\nI really hope you can patch things up with her and have a healthy relationship.

It's not your responsibility to coddle your mother, though. I had to go through years of counseling to get to a point where I can set boundaries with my mother and, wow, does she try to break them.

If you\u2019re saying it from a place of authenticity to explain to her how her actions effected and hurt you as a kid and you\u2019re still dealing with that now, that might be information that will touch her and maybe help her get her act together.

They need to hear the hard truth, not comfortable lies. Sounds like she had a horrible time as a child herself, but then she continued the cycle on you which was real far from ok.

Once someone does that, they stop being (just) a victim and become an asshole as well.\n\nNTA for being honest.  Maybe she\u2019ll hear it, maybe she won\u2019t.  My only suggestion is that the honesty should have come the next day when she was sober.
