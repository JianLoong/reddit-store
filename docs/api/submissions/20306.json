Being around her is not healthy for you.", "wow OP, i\u2019ve had a *very* similar experience, from her having me young and continuing the destructive behaviors into adulthood and making herself the victim. i completely understand you feeling like the AH but \u2026 from an outside POV \u2026 NTA. i\u2019ve had a moment like that pretty recently and it\u2019s hard for both parties to acknowledge and accept. hard for your mom to hear that she was a bad mother, hard for you to admit that she did anything wrong. it feels wrong and terrible, and i\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this. definitely NTA. maybe controversial opinion ? but you don\u2019t owe your parents anything, but they owe you everything. you didn\u2019t choose to be born but they chose to give birth to you. coping or not, it affected you as her child and to play the victim when you were subjected to that treatment and those feelings from birth is just not right. if she feels bad because you told her the truth, that\u2019s her own problem, not yours, as bad as it feels. you\u2019re doing what you can to repair the damage that SHE did. you shouldn\u2019t apologize for being honest. even if it hurts her feelings. easier said than done, but i would say stick by it. stand your ground in hopes that she will actually takes you seriously instead of steamrolling you with her own feelings like she\u2019s been doing. i really really *really* hope she can bring herself to change. you, as her child, deserve that. sending you love bro.", "I don't even need to read the story. The title just straight up reads NTA. If a parent is addicted to alcohol or substances, they are a bad parent.", "Drunken bawling on the phone is a signature alcoholic behaviour. It doesn't mean a thing. They don't remember, or care after they wake up. It is what alcohol does! You need to stop being her person on the other side of the line. You were not talking to your mom, you were talking to the bottle. If she drunk for decades, it is more life saving for you to let her be. You need to let her go and stop talking to the bottle that she just consumed. She needs to be a few years sober for you to have a conversation with real her, even then if she was abusive, they can be dry drunk.", "Definitely NTA!\n\nShe knew she was a bad mother, hence she said it. She can't be mad that you finally agreed ONCE! It's not your job to cater to her when she feels guilty about what she did to you, and keep responding with \"no, you were a great mom.\"\n Clearly she wasn't, and she knows that even when you try to say otherwise, which is why she still randomly brings it up. You should have been telling her the truth for a long time now. Maybe it'll cause some much needed self reflection, because this isn't about how she was a horrible mother and what SHE went through...\nIt's about her being a horrible mother and all the things she DID to you, and what YOU went through! \nHopefully she will see how selfish she has been and that not everything is about her... and maybe start to see the trauma she caused to you and actually be a parent!", "NTA", "Sounds like she needs the drama.\nDon't feed into her drama theatrics. And she will most likely start acting better if she actually wants to have discourse with you.\nTruth and consequences are something most can't cope with these days. \nYou're NTA. You just told the truth.  Thats the consequences of her actions.", "NTA... I had a terrible abusive husband. But I knew that I needed to be there for the kids. That the kids were the most important aspect. I did slip a couple of times in terms of letting my frustration get the best of me. But most of the time my mindset was that I was here to protect my kids from the man. Of course, being away from him would've been healthier for us, and I would've brought them up very differently. But what I'm saying is that a bad man is not the reason to be a bad mother.", "NTA\n\nIts not your job to comfort your parent, it was her job to take care of you. Telling the truth and keeping people accountable will never be an asshole move, no matter how much it hurts them. If it hurts her to hear how shes a bad mother then maybe she shouldve treated you better. Its all on her.", "Well she was a shit parent and should be told how much she f\u2019d up, she wants reassurance that\u2019s why she calls but she just doesn\u2019t deserve it"]}
