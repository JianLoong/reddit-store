Whatever depths she hit last night, she voluntarily took that dive. Whatever dreadful places she went to, when foster care had to rescue you as a child from her abuse, she went there voluntarily. \n\nAnd odds are she won't even *remember* what you told her, when she sobers up.\n\nTime for you to check out the groups for family members of addicts, like Al-Alon and Narc-Anon. Time for you to allow yourself to speak more truth: yeah, she wasn't a good mother. \n\nNTA and the truth shall set you free, OP", "NTA. You told her the truth, and she is just taking out guilt accumulated over years and projecting it on you. You do not have to comfort or lie to her.", "NTA.  If you want a relationship do not engage with her in this way.   Someday the resentment will be even worse.  She is parentifying  you which is very damaging for a young adult especially one with disadvantages.  You are in more danger than her. \n\nDon\u2019t answer her calls.  Let voicemail get them and if she sounds sober call her back. Or you call her at a specific time and if she starts in with drama get off the phone.  Right now her emotional outbursts are being rewarded and you are encouraging her to have more.  Gray rock her when she gets like this \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out!  Gotta go!\u201d   Never answer an incoming call directly.", "NTA. She wasn't then and she isn't now.

I don\u2019t know what your situation is with her, but maybe she needed to hear the truth, maybe she needs to get herself some counselling and not be relying on you to comfort her.", "NTA. She wants you to lie and reassure her that she was a good parent when she perfectly knows she wasn\u2019t. In other words this is all about herself. You do not have to indulge her.", "It sounds like she's trying emotionally manipulate youso she has someone to take the heat for her if something goes wrong", "Next time don\u2019t sit in silence listening to her self pitying sobs. Hang up the phone. NTA\n\nAnd if she was a bad mother then, well, she is a bad mother *now*. WTF calling you in the middle of the night, drunk, at a party, and wanting to \u201ctake it outside\u201d.

I hope being able to say that out loud was freeing for you. You don't owe her reassurance or comfort.", "NTA telling the truth can only\nMake you an A when it\u2019s unnecessary. Like if you see a fat person on the street and yell, \u201cyou\u2019re fat!\u201d Is it true? Yes, is it necessary? No. So that would be an instance where you\u2019re an A for telling the truth. In this case, she wants you to lie to her to make her feel better, but she clearly doesn\u2019t even believe the lies herself, drunk words are sober thoughts, and the fact that it\u2019s a repetitive cycle shows she knows she was bad. If you truly feel bad about it, encourage her to seek therapy and maybe join AA to try to be a better person now, perhaps frame it as, \u201cyou weren\u2019t the best parent mom, but if you put in the work now you can be the best grandparent you can be.\u201d That\u2019s what I would do. Just because you\u2019re an adult doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t your mother, and just because you\u2019re an adult doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be a good mom now.

Your mother (and I use the term biologically) was not a good parent to you. She apparently is not yet able to take responsibility for herself or her actions, as evidenced by her behavior last night. \n\nIt is not your job to coddle her emotions.

You don't owe her anything.", "NTA - and prepare yourself for when she dies. I\u2019m not saying this to be callus but my abusive, addict mom died at 55. It cost me and my brothers $6000 to do the bare minimum with cremation, burial, and a shitty marker stone for her grave. Lots of unresolved trauma, and lots of guilt. I\u2019m in my 40\u2019s and only now have any real sense of self worth. It\u2019s still skewed too low if you ask others but it\u2019s a start. So, prepare. If telling her she was a bad mom hits you so hard you posted online about it, my hunch is your emotional time bomb will not be unlike my own. You are an amazing human. You have thoughts, ideas and abilities that nobody else has in quite the same way. You are deserving of love, security, and community. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but if I\u2019m not, have a plan to get your mind right and have supports in place. Hugs and best wishes.", "I think it\u2019s really unethical to give advice like this with next to no understanding of who OP and their mother is, what their relationship looks like or anything other\nThan a couple cursory paragraphs.", "Thats literally the point of this entire subreddit my friend. If people didnt want to hear people's opinions or advice on their problems than they wouldnt post about them here to begin with. Its always just a couple cursory paragraphs due to character limits. Its not unethical because noone is forcing op into any kind of action, people post their opinion and suggestion about how to move forward and op can can take what they want from the thread, heeding or ignoring posts as they see fit."]}
