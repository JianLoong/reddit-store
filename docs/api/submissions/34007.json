She\u2019d been staying with her mom while she was in town for a few weeks (she lives in NC but is on medical leave ) and they got into a fight. I told her yes of course, she can stay as long as she needs. In the course of her being here her and her boyfriend broke up, and according to her the relationship was the last thing keeping her in NC. So she\u2019s decided to stay in the state and find employment/housing. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be housing and feeding her indefinitely with little to no financial support, but I wasn\u2019t about to put her on the streets.\n\nThe issue is; I recently got into a relationship with Kam (25m). We\u2019ve been toying around with the idea for a year in the FWB stage, and he formally asked me out last week. So of course we\u2019ve been very much in the honeymoon stage. We aren\u2019t egregious with PDA, but I\u2019ll admit there\u2019s alot of giggling and hand holding, showing affection we didn\u2019t before. But we still converse normally, and don\u2019t leave Jay out. But this is apparently BOTHERING Jay. She\u2019ll huff around the apartment, lock my bedroom door when he\u2019s here, and generally just be kinda bitchy. Anytime I bring him up, she\u2019s cold and disinterested. \n\nThe main issue came about an hour ago. Kam was over hanging out, one thing led to another and we ended up having a quickie on the couch. Jay texted me after, angry as hell and saying I was disrespectful??? For having sex with her in the other room. I\u2019ll admit some pent up anger from walking around on eggshells caused me to explode a bit. I asked her how the hell having sex in my own house was disrespectful. We did our best to keep it down and make it quick. Her argument was #1 that we did it in the living room, and #2 while she was awake. I told her it wouldn\u2019t have been in the living room if she didn\u2019t lock herself in MY bedroom, which is where people USUALLY have sex. And it\u2019s my damned house, I\u2019ll fuck on the kitchen counters if I like. She accused me of being a \u201cdictator of the house just like our parents\u201d, said I was being a shitty friend, and stormed back into the room. \n\nSo you guys tell me.
