That's the equivalent to eating a piece of peanut approximately the size of a grain of salt.\n\nSo to start allergen exposure treatment for someone like that, they're going to dose maybe 25-30 micrograms (that is, 0.025-0.030 milligrams) of peanut protein. And the goal of the several years-long treatment process isn't \"person can chow down on peanuts,\" it's \"touching a peanut probably won't cause anaphylaxis.\"\n\nMilder allergies can also be treated in that manner, but they generally will have a larger starting dose, and in some cases, can actually cure the allergy. And some people do outgrow allergies. But severe allergies, much like the Wu-Tang Clan, ain't nothin' to fuck with.", "Yep. And even with the allergies that can be cured with allergy shots, it's a years-long process that still requires careful monitoring. When I got them, I had to get the first shot from every new vial in the doctor's office just in case I had a reaction to that shot. And we had a vial of epinephrine in the fridge in case I had a reaction to the shots I got at home. And mine were environmental allergies that were able to be cured and were mostly mild reactions on the scale of allergy reactions. (They felt huge to me, but it was just the stuffy/runny nose & itchy/watery eyes type, so I was miserable but not in serious danger from them.)"]}
