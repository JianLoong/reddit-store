He texted my siblings and I in a group chat to let us know and we\u2019re all happy for him. \nI admit that I do not like the age gap and my dad and I argued about it in the beginning. They\u2019ve been together a year and she makes him happy so I let it go. \nThere\u2019s a lot of issues with my dads past relationships that I won\u2019t really get into too much, but essentially his last wife has BPD and was horribly abusive to me from ages 7-17. He\u2019s had a couple bad relationships since then, so I feel a lot of anxiety when he starts a new one. \n\nAnyway on to why I could be the AH.\nHis fianc\u00e9 texted me this morning with a wedding date that\u2019s 3 days before my birthday. It hurts my feelings, mostly because they like to vacation a lot, so I imagine they would plan trips for their anniversary, meaning my dad would be out of town every year on my bday. \nI\u2019m the oldest of a lot of siblings and my mom took off when I was a baby, so my birthday was really the only time growing up I got to feel special to my dad. I honestly feel stupid typing this out now.\nI texted my dad asking if that day was set and he said it was. I texted him back saying that I didn\u2019t want to seem selfish but I was worried that if he got married so close to my bday, that he would be out of town every year around then. I didn\u2019t ask him to change it, but I let him know it would make me sad. \nIt\u2019s been hours and he hasn\u2019t responded and I\u2019m worried he thinks I\u2019m a selfish asshole trying to start problems.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I feel like I might have done myself a disservice by the title. I never asked my dad to change the date, I made no demands or ultimatums. \nI told him how I felt, that\u2019s it. I have a lot of anxiety about his relationships in general and I thought it was better that I said how I felt rather then bottle it up. \nI have a lot of resentment for how I grew up, he knew what was happening and didn\u2019t protect me. It would take me hours to list all the things his ex did and how he enabled her. I listed a couple in a comment, but a big one was she would burn my books. In the fire place, or campfires. Sometimes she throw them out the window while driving. Books were my only escape, (because she had me grounded from almost everything you can think of 24/7 365) so even tho she did a lot of worse things, that\u2019s the one I think about still.\n\nI think because I\u2019ve only ever felt important to him once a year, this is effecting me more then it should. The general consensus is that my feelings are unreasonable and I can understand that. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t responded still, and his fianc\u00e9 is posting that date on FB so there\u2019s nothing else I can do but be happy for them and help make their day special, I just hope he isn\u2019t upset with me.", "created_utc": 1673816006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cumc3/aita_for_suggesting_my_dad_change_his_wedding_date/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Communicating concerns with your family seems perfectly ordinary. It's not selfish to express your concerns. It definitely would be selfish to make demands.

You\u2019re 30, no one cares about your birthday anymore, sorry \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA especially given everything you said. Also, you asked your dad, but you didn\u2019t insist or be a jerk about it. If it is in fact set in stone then you will need to move on though.

And even when so many tells you that you are old enough to suck it up the true is that everyone has different ways to feel it. I spent every birthday with my mom and it would make sad to know that she is not going to be around anymore in that important date because took us so long to get in good terms in our relationship, so now this is important to both of us.\n\nSpeak with him again and listen how he feel about everything and if your dad doesn't see it like you there's nothing that you can do besides be happy and support him.", "NTA - You expressed your feelings not making any demands. Thats a totally fine thing to do.", "NTA\n\nDon't feel bad for asking. I'm sure your dad knows you meant no harm.", "NTA, I can see lots of hurt and trauma in your reactions that dont just go away just cause you're 30 now. You haven't been rude or entitled yet so I dont see an AH here. \nBUT from one very hurt daughter to another, seek therapy. This isnt about the date or the wedding.

But I think it would benefit you to maybe work through this. All the best to you OP!", "YTA - you are 30 yrs old.  The day is 3 days from your birthday, not on your actual birthday. You are worried your dad may not be home on your birthday.  Maybe it\u2019s just me, but it all sounds childish.  I just can\u2019t imagine trying to tell someone they shouldn\u2019t get married 3 days before my birthday because it makes me feel not special and hurts my feelings.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s ok to let him know.

You'd be an AH if he says no and you proceed to make him feel bad, but you're not an AH for just expressing your feelings and asking for reassurance that you'll still be able to spend time together on a special day.\n\nAlso I'm not sure why people keep dismissing your want to spend time with your family on your birthday just bc youre 30? You don't just stop loving your family or wanting to be with them for special occasions after 18 lmao. Our family always spend birthdays together and the ages range from 7 - 70. Don't let those comments get you down, you don't need to 'grow up' bc you want to spend time with loved ones on your bday.", "NTA You people who ate criticizing the OP. The reason there is a question is the very very bad relationship decisions the father had made in the past. Those bad decisions are why the question comes up around failed birthdays in the future. Past experience tells OP that the oast will be repeated. Not because they want a birthday party in their 30s.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t ask/demand he change thr date. You expressed how you feel. I also don\u2019t think any age is too old to want your family around for a special occasion, like a birthday.", "NTA.\nI see a lot of responses telling OP to grow up, no one cares about bd at that age yada yada yada.\nEven if all that were true and those posters ignoring the background, what did OP do to make them the AH? They did\n- not get mad or make any accusations\n- not demand them to change the date\n- not threaten to not attend the wedding\n- simply told the father how they felt about it and what implications they fear it might have in the future\nHow did communicate openly in a mature way about ones feeling suddenly make you the AH, even if the ressons for these feelings might be immature? (with which I don't totally agree given the context as it might damage the relationship in the long run btw)", "NTA - you told your Dad about your feelings. To talk about your feelings and your worries is never a bad thing. \nYou did not tell him to move the wedding especially. \nIt is okay to feel this way. I would be sad too, if my parents would never come to my birthday because they travel every year. \nEven though i am 30 as well. I am still their child! \n\nWhat you shouldn\u2019t do if they don\u2019t move the date to push further or make a scene out of it. \nFirst it won\u2019t help anybody. And make you the asshole as a wedding is a pretty special thing.", "NTA. That's a reasonable concern, and if they've been engaged for less than 24 hours, there's no way in hell that the date is set in stone. Literally nothing could possibly be booked unless they lied to you about when they started planning.\n\n\n\nI also find it weird that she's the one who texted you instead of him. I think your dad may have found another toxic one.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re 30 years old. You\u2019re at the point where your dad has a life outside of you. His world does not necessarily revolve around you anymore cause you\u2019re 30. \n\nYou all can do special things with your birthday but it might not mean it\u2019s on your birthday. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. You\u2019d still be spending quality time together. \n\nYou are being selfish.", "YTA - youre THIRTY. \n\nIm guessing you would find any reason to complain about this wedding.", "NTA \n\nFirst, you didn't ask - you just expressed your feelings. As long as you're not demanding someone else take responsibility for your feelings, expressing them is very rarely AH behavior.\n\nSecond, your feelings are very valid. Now, feelings are feelings, and all that, but your feelings about this are understandable, reasonable, make sense, are almost predictable, really, and are entirely valid. It's absolutely OK to express to your father that you feel as though his anniversary will take away the one thing that made you feel special to him. \n\nSo, I vote for you being on the side of angels. \n\nI hope your father went silent in order to try to negotiate another date with his fiancee, rather than because he doesn't care.", "NTA, All you did is express your concerns.\nIf you demanded it be changed... then it'd be a different story.", "NAH. This is coming from someone born 2 days before my parents 1st anniversary. As I got older my mom would almost completely forget mine birthday in favor of their anniversary plans. Or ask how old I am so she could figure out what anniversary it was for them. Or completely forget your 18th birthday that you were sick for and had to take the ACT the next day. Then bitch at you for being sad and ruining their mood. Shrugs..that\u2019s just the beginning of having a December birthday.", "Man, what\u2019s with all the YTA comments based on her age? She\u2019s clearly saying, \u201cmy dad is selfish and once a year l can count on him treating me as be should.\u201d \n\nAge has nothing to do with this. It\u2019s a selfish parent and a kid\u2019s concern over losing the last remaining thread. \n\nNTA. Sorry OP, that others are shitting on you co much", "NAH. He set a date, you asked a question and he answered, and you kept any comments to yourself. \n\nI get why spending time with your dad on your birthday is special to you, but I think you have to let it go. I\u2019m older than you by a fair bit (I\u2019m 52) but still, by the time I was out of college, I was never spending birthdays with my parents. I still don\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love me, or me them, or anything like that. It\u2019s just life. \n\nAlso you\u2019re speculating. You have no idea that they\u2019ll travel on their anniversary. They might. Even if they don\u2019t get you might not be able to see your dad that day for lots of reasons. But you can still celebrate your birthday on other days. Isn\u2019t the celebration/visiting more important than doing it on the day?", "NTAH.  Spending your birthday with your dad has always been of major importance in your life.  You were right to ask him about it.  In the rush of excitement, they may have not thought a minute about anniversary trips, much less the honeymoon and the timeframe of everything to your birthday.  He may need some time to think about handle this situation.  At some point, there may have to be compromises.  It\u2019s the reality of life.  You may have children.  He may have another.  Illness.  Moving.   Circumstances changing can\u2019t be the  reason to lose a tradition.  If they were, we\u2019d have none.", "NTA. \n\nI think your concern is valid. It sounds like you have multiple legitimate reasons to crave some validation from your dad (abandoned by mum; abusive step mother; turbulent relationships overall; discomfort with current partner: various circumstances always setting you guys against each other) and want to safeguard a time with him you used to be able to rely upon. It sounds like it just so happens to be your birthday (although caring about your birthday is also allowed).  \n\nI hope your dad can at least sympathise with your request, if not accomodate it. Sending love, well done for trying to communicate in a productive way \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, all you did was express how you felt which considering the background is understandable. I usually side eye people who make a big deal out of their birthdays but it sounds like you\u2019ve went through a lot in life.\n\nIf it\u2019s about having a special day with your dad, maybe suggest a different day where you celebrate your birth. Doesn\u2019t have to be on the exact date you got born.", "NTA - gonna shoot it here .\n\nHe is your dad , it's your birthday . ofc you want him in your birthdays , and you're his daughter- best one to know him and his habits , so your feelings are valid tbh .\n\nI don't think it's childish or selfish , you didn't technically ask for him to change it but you expressed your worries which is healthy and it's also within your rights ..idk , nta to me though", "NTA\n\nI think asking your dad to be in town for your birthday is fair. Have a chat with him and see what's possible. He can go ahead with the date and hopefully agree to not book holidays over your bday whenever possible.", "YTA:  You know every year you're dad can just see you before or after your birthday right", "NTA- had you handled it different I\u2019d say YTA but I understand that you want to spend time with your dad in your birthday considering family dynamics  and it makes sense you\u2019d conclude that\u2019s not going to happen if his anniversary is so closeand they travel.I hope he responds, and as a new parent I\u2019d honestly never plan to get married so close to my daughters birthday (I\u2019m married now to her dad and I hope I never have a second husband to consider this of course lol) I don\u2019t think age is relevant; I\u2019m 30 and my mom got remarried the month after my birthday and while she\u2019s not seen me on every birthday if I wanted her to I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t miss it (I also see her a bunch and only have a couple siblings) and I can definitively say she\u2019d have never picked a date close to my birthday just in case. But as you say your birthday is an important time for you to see your dad I really get being upset that time may be taken away and again I think you were fair and NTA to say something and be nice about it. May not change anything but at least you told him how you feel he may be more inclined to make a point to spend more time with you or he could be trying to work something out; I hope it works out for you!", "NTA some people grew up healthy and can\u2019t understand how it is, if you didn\u2019t. You have feelings and needs and that\u2019s ok. Don\u2019t worry about your fathers reaction.", "NTA you just want to spend time with your dad on your birthday and it can\u2019t be that hard to move the date since they literally got engaged the day before and set the date the next morning", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, you\u2019re 30. Might be time to grow up. You don\u2019t always get to celebrate your bday on the day and as an adult, sometimes you don\u2019t get to celebrate at all.\n\nNext, very few people take a trip every year for their anniversary. \n\nYou sound jealous and immature.", "NTA. I get it that you would like to have your dad around on your birthday, then again, it has been my experience that the older you get, the less important your birthday gets. Heck, there are even years when I'd much prefer to forget mine. Don't attach too much importance to the age difference. At their stage of life, 11 years don't mean much. They may mean more later, when your father is old and his wife still middle-aged, especially if your father has bad health. On the other hand, none of us can get insurance about how our lives are going to turn out. 10 good years together will not come back to bite them, for instance. Point is, they are adults, it is their decision.", "YTA\n\nYou are 30 and dont need to dictate what your father does on or around your birthday.  Seriously, you are worrying about him planning future vacations that may be on your birthday?  Just celebrate together on a different day. What's the big deal?", "You're fine with feeling that way, and talking to him about it. But c'mon, you're 30. It's likely you'll be starting a family of your own soon, if you haven't already. You'll never get your childhood back, there's no point in looking back. Also, your dad is 55. He'll be retiring in a few years, and will be able to travel whenever he wants. They won't HAVE to leave on the exact date of their anniversary, and it's not like they are newlywed twenty somethings. \n\nI think you're making a mountain out of a molehill, and he's probably trying to figure out how to respond to all this, because it's a little nuts. I'll say there's NAH, but you need to get past the birthday thing. It's one day a year and the older you get, you'll probably find they become less important to you.", "NAH. It's good that you told him how you feel. Why don't you and your dad pick another time of the year to celebrate your birthday?", "NTA for feeling like you do, but you will be if you decide to push it any further.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Selfish and childish. Birthdays aren't that important as an adult.", "YTA", "YTA. OMG. You\u2019re 30. Your birthday is not a national holiday. People have their own lives to live that don\u2019t revolve around you. The fact that you are worried about vacations that may or may not happen is the height of selfishness. Get a grip.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your issue is more about the woman than your birthday. You're 30 years old, at that age most families will send a card and a phone call for their family member.", "I mean it's a birthday... Not anything real special. You'd be asking him to change his wedding day to cater to your birthday, which seems silly. As for the age gap, not really any of your business, he's a grown man and can do that if he wants. It's not like shes a 21 year old, she's 39 and can make that decision on her own without your help.", "Mild YTA. At this age, unfortunately, people (parents included) aren\u2019t planning around our birthdays anymore, we aren\u2019t little kids. I love going out with my friends on my birthday, and I\u2019d say maybe 60% of the time my parents have been around for my birthday. But if not, I still welcome a nice phone call, and we celebrate next time I see them. I\u2019m sure your dad will understand how you feel, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to change a wedding date to cater to my birthday.", "I feel your pain, but that's what it is: YOUR pain. Your dad might never be able to give you what you want from him most. You have to deal with this, therapy maybe? and then start planning some freakin' awesome birthdays!

Your birthday isn't a reason for everyone to drop what they're doing to celebrate.  There could be dozens of reasons they chose that date, but it also could be the only date venue/catering/photographer of choice was available.

You have a valid reason for worrying/feeling the way you do and you expressed it without making any demands. You told him how something he is doing makes you feel and your concerns for the future. I don\u2019t see that being AH behavior. You would move into AH territory if you started DEMANDING he changes things. This has to be his decision, and you need to accept whatever he decides. Expressing your fears of how something may emotionally effect you in the future is valid and healthy. I especially sympathize with you because you mentioned your birthday was the only time of year you really felt you deeply bonded with him or felt a special connection. \n\nYou are not in the wrong to express your fears. However, things change, life happens, we all must adapt in life and sometimes things don\u2019t work out the way we\u2019d *ideally* like them to.

You're 30 years old, and someone planning their wedding in the same week you turn 31 \"hurt your feelings\"?\n\nDo everyone a favor, rsvp that you're not coming, since you are not mature enough to go to an adult affair.", "Yta take your own trips on your birthday", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge PITA to plan a wedding right now. Depending on where they want to get married, maybe they had very limited dates. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re 30 yrs old. I saw the comment about how your dad always made you feel special on your birthday\u2026 that\u2019s so lovely, lucky you. I sure wish my parents did that in my younger years. Time to be less selfish and let your dad and his new love have their day. And if he decides to travel with his wife around your birthday, that\u2019s wonderful that they\u2019re living their own lives and doing their own thing, and you should be happy for them. You\u2019ll have to work out a compromise, as adults.", "YTA, grow up.", "YTA.  You are 30 years-old and you expect your dad to keep your birthday day available for you forever?!  That\u2019s just ridiculous.  Parents get to live their own lives once their children are adults.", "I mean this in a really nice way but YTA, you're a full grown adult and your birthday is not important to anyone but you (not personal! Its everyone).", "Sorry your 30, not 12. Birthdays aren't big deals anymore. Yep people say Happy Birthday. You get cards, you SO and you get dinner and a gift\n\nBUT you don't get to ask people to change their wedding date because it's close to your birthday and they might celebrate their anniversary more than your birthday.\n\nWhat's next, asking your sister or SIL to get induced so they don't deliver too close to your birthday?\n\nNobody can marry anyone else with a birthday close to your birthday? \n\nI mean my anniversary is the same as one of my Aunts, I didn't even realize it when we set our date. She just said cool. I hope you have a nice long marriage like I did.", "The very first thing you did - and not just in passing, but specifically initiated a communication - was ask him if there's any chance of the date being changed because you don't like this one for a self-centered/selfish reason.  It IS, very selfish, that your most important thought and immediate reaction to this is basically \"boohoo I might get less attention and not feel special anymore\".  You're not thinking about your dad and his feelings, you're thinking about yourself.  You say \"we're all happy for him\" but that's clearly not the case with your further words and actions.  It's ok to have feelings, and it's ok to express them, but the way you did so was very rude.  You should have saved this question for part of a longer conversation instead of immediately texting him about it.  YTA for that reason.\n\nThis is honestly over the top.  It's not like they're getting married on your ACTUAL birthday.  And if a close anniversary means they're away on your birthday and you have to celebrate on a different day, oh well - that's a very common part of adult life due to work conflicts, dealing with kids, whatever.  I could understand you being upset if you were under 10, or even a teenager, but in your 30s?  Birthdays just aren't such a big deal anymore, it's a little sad but that's just life.  And again, you're in your 30s - it shouldn't be all up to your dad to make you feel special on your birthday.  He'll always be your parent, but his kids are grown, he needs to be allowed to have his own separate life again.  I turned 29 a few months ago and I didn't see any of my family on my birthday, I went out for dinner with my best friend. \n\nYou need to get yourself some help, you are projecting your emotional baggage onto everyone else instead of dealing with it properly.  You've had bad experiences with your dad's past relationships - I'm very sorry you had to go through that, but ultimately, that has nothing to do with your dad's current partner, and it's not fair for you to come at it with that lens either.  You're an adult, you don't have to live with them or have them closely involved in your life, you shouldn't be having anxiety and negative feelings around your father's relationships - and if you are, that's valid, but they are also YOUR problem that YOU have to deal with via therapy and whatever else.  You aren't responsible for causing your trauma, but you are unfortunately responsible for dealing with it and not smearing your figurative shit on other people.  \n\nAnd an age gap of about 15 years, at this stage in their lives, is perfectly reasonable.  I understand it may be a bit strange for you, but ultimately not inappropriate and it's really not your place to have opinions about.", "YTA, it's ridiculous that a 30 year old woman wants someone to move their wedding because it's 3 days before her birthday.", "Well put.", "I agree. I think by the time most turn 30, they\u2019re kind of over their own birthday, but she said it was her only day to feel special to her dad, so I don\u2019t think she did wrong by communicating her feelings in a calm, reasonable way. \n\nAnd OP, if your dad is out of town for some of your birthdays, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not special to him anymore. Perhaps you can plan a time for when he\u2019s back for just the two of you to celebrate. Or create a new tradition and celebrate on your \u201chalf birthday\u201d or something.\n\nNAH", "Right? It\u2019s like they think a person is disposable after 29.", "Man, thank you. People here got shitty recently about another person wanting to celebrate their 30th, too. \u201cI don\u2019t feel happy on my birthdays so I don\u2019t think you should either\u201d is a depressing take.", "I considered all of this, and was going to say no assholes here, but\n\n>His fianc\u00e9 texted me this morning with a wedding date that\u2019s 3 days before my birthday.  \n>  \n>I texted my dad asking if that day was set and he said it was. I texted him back saying that I didn\u2019t want to seem selfish but I was worried that if he got married so close to my bday, that he would be out of town every year around then. \n\nOP's immediate response was to reach out to their father to ask about the possibility of the date being changed for a reason that ultimately IS quite selfish.  It's like saying \"I don't give a shit about your happiness and good news, I only care about how it might affect me\".  I think it would've been totally ok to have and express these feelings in a different way at a different time.  But the self-centeredness of it is why I think YTA.", "Nothing. He asked me to be in the wedding before I asked about the date and I said yes, not planning on changing that regardless of his reaction. I want him to be happy and have a awesome wedding. Just thought I would express how I felt instead of bottling up. Kinda wished I posted a WIBTA before I texted him now.", "I really appreciate what you said, thank you.", "That's super mean.  People care about other people's birthdays if they care about that person and that person cares about their birthday.", "WAIT, I text every one of my kids near their birthday.", "That's just bullshit and a super shitty thing to say. I'm 38 and my family still cares about my birthday, my parents included. OP did nothing wrong by asking and at this point, you look like a much bigger AH than OP. \n\nNTA", "Damn just bc you\u2019re miserable and either don\u2019t like your birthday or your parents doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to be too", "Oh this one is so hard for me.  Objectively, YTA.  But it\u2019s very clear you have an incredibly difficult relationship with your dad.  And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about your birthday.  It\u2019s about you wanting to feel like you matter to him.  Like he loves you like he should.\n\nIt breaks my heart, from one woman (girl) who wishes her dad could do right by her.  I\u2019m 40 and while it\u2019s ok now, it wasn\u2019t for a long, long time.  And, the hurt never totally goes away.\n\nAll I can say is, you can\u2019t change him.  All you can control is how you react to him.  Less contact is usually more.  \n\nText him and tell him you\u2019re sorry you got upset, but it\u2019s totally fine and you hope he can be patient with you as you adjust to this big change.  Tell him you\u2019re happy for him.  Then, space.  And work on building a life and a family you love.  It will change everything.  Make the family you didn\u2019t have.", "I didn't care about my bday until my coworkers and friends did so. I'm sorry you don't have people who care about something as simple as the day you were born kek", "With a side of grow the f*\u00d7k up.", "[removed]", "You're an unkind person, geez", "Based on what??", "I don\u2019t know if they picked that date for any specific reason. They started dating a couple months before that date last year.", "I think the A-H judgements are glossing over the fact that your birthday is the one time of year your dad sets time aside just for you. They\u2019re also glossing over the fact that his ex abused you for a decade, so focusing on you once a year is the very least he can do. \n\nReading between the lines, I\u2019m guessing you and your siblings always come a distant second to whomever your dad is dating at the moment. Your concern that his wedding date is going to forever overshadow your birthday (the one day a year your dad makes you a priority) is valid. \n\nNTA.", "Eh. Petty me would just suck if up for a little while until it eventually ends. Maybe the next wedding wont be too close to your date", "He doesn\u2019t deserve you.

I even set an alarm to remember.", "The person you\u2019re replying to in a later comment says their dad hasn\u2019t remembered their birthday \u201cin years.\u201d Just another case of someone taking their unhappiness out on others.

So my birthday was spent alone in a mid-range hotel room. It was kind of a bummer. Then they went away for 2 weeks in December and we're supposed to come back right before Christmas, and their flight got canceled bc of the horrible weather, so Christmas was spent alone too. I know other people who had truly big sad things happen to them last year but 2022 was a very lonely year for me.\n\nI don't need anything big, but I like to do something.

At this point she\u2019s her own adult with her own life and there should be other ways of celebrating her birthday, the dependency on her dad in this instance doesn\u2019t seem linked to anything other than a nervous hold she has on him in her thoughts *based off the past.* \n\nThere is sooo much about this that makes me think she has her own self to figure out and regardless what happens with her father she will have to address it sometimes. Let her dad get married, age gap is weird sure, but they\u2019re both adults and even if he leaves town for one birthday it won\u2019t mean he never celebrates her again. \n\nIf I were to add a last point just for shits and giggles - she\u2019s doing that thing that kids do where they forget their parent as a person and only see them as a parent.
