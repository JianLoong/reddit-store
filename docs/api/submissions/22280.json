Gross.", "Never been to New Zealand, then, I take it...?", "You know Aus gets snow right??", "I mean it\u2019s been -3C here where I live in Australia at night\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I very much doubt that would be comfortable for an old dog. \n\nI believe 10C is considered around the limit (4C and under is life threatening).", "So many places in south america other than tierra del fuego are very cold in winter. Most of the towns around the andes mountains get very cold. Also in Chile already from the Araucania region the winters are very harsh. And no, not all of the south of Chile/Argentina are part of Tierra del Fuego \ud83d\ude44", "Lol, as a pet owner, hardwood floors should be the floors, apart from like tiles, that can stand pets. Like what are you scared of? Scratches? If so, then you really have chosen a bad type of wood that won't withstand walking on. The vast majority of floors in Sweden are hardwood and we barely have any outside dogs, if it was such a big hazard towards the floors, people would be ripping them up right and left. \n\nIf it's about pee and poo, that is sooo much easier to clean up from hard floors than carpets.\n\nSomehow I get the feeling that the floors are an excuse, which means YTA and a sillybilly. Maybe don't date people with dogs if it's such an issue to you.\n\nOh and yeah, shoes indoors are a big nono for all Scandis as well.", "For the record, saying this as an equivalency should show how fucked up you are.", "And so what ? Are the shoes going to freeze to death outside Or whine and feel abandonned ?   \nyour value system is messed up sir", "Me too. I have a dog. He lives inside. In our apartment. We found these things called RUGS", "Just break up.  You're both gigantic assholes to this dog.  You for making it stay outside instead of the comforts and safety of the indoors.  And she's an asshole for listening to you.  I say it's even animal abuse.  You both suck.", "He's an AH for knowing the extent of this dog's effect on his partner and treating it like that. \"Preferences?\" Sure. The bed thing isn't the issue I'm having with it, I totally understand that and it's a valid compromise to make. However, NEVER HAVING THE DOG IN HIS HOUSE? EVER? Not even to VISIT? That's not a compromise, that's incompatibility. Something to that extent is huge. It's dangerous to leave a dog alone in a car for that long. Frankly I'd go ESH for the sole purpose of Lucy putting her animal through this just for her current partner. A 10 year old dog, depending on breed, is considered a senior, and it's the start of them needing extra care and attention. Definitely not the time to leave them alone outside and in a car.", "This sounds like a step in the rught direction: A dog can be pefectly happy sleeping in a comfortably warm garage. Just make sure it has a little dog house type of thing that is insulated and maybe has some heating if the winters get cold where you live. \n\nBut I'd also consider letting the dog inside during the day under the condition it doesn\u2019t go on furniture. The smell isn't necessarily the whole house or just the dog, it tends to get stuck in fabric/ upholstery and is stronger in rooms where there is a dog bed (=fabric). So you could try to compromise by not having a smell magnet in the house, but in the garage, protect the floors by purting shoes on the dog and accepting that the dog deserves to have a good life. Dogs want to be near their people and forcing it outside 100% is kind of cruel. Lucy probably won't be outside as much and the dog doesn\u2019t understand why it's being \"punished\" by seperation. \n\nYou don't like dogs in your home and that's your right, but the dog shouldn't suffer for it. Spend more time at Lucy's, compromise or break up.", "Then, the dog needs bathing, grooming, a dental check, and the house needs a jolly good clean. \n\nYou are both incompatible. \n\nI have owned dogs for 40 years. The only time my home smells doggy is if I haven't cleaned the house properly and groomed the dog. \n\nWe did have one period where my elderly dog had cancer, and the disease had a smell, but that wasn't the smell of a wet, unclean dog.\n\nI have wood floors throughout the house, except the staircase. There is no damage from the dog. Humans, however, have damaged my floors. \n\nESH - except the dog.", "Then why are you dating someone who owns an indoor dog? Seriously, it's kind of a fundamental incompatibility.", "What\u2019s your plan for the future? Do you have any?", "I don\u2019t think you realize how normal functioning brains work.", "Honestly you just sound like a massive snowflake", "You two are not compatible; break up with her and move on.", "True, but people who like dogs don't care. Why are you dating somebody who likes dogs and wants them in her life, and you're trying to take that away from her?\n\nDogs bring her joy, they don't bring you joy. To you, the solution is \"so no dogs, of course!\" as if it's totally ok that you just get to remove an entire source of happiness and enrichment from another person\n\nJust because you don't happen to like the same thing. You're awful", "You sound like the worst kind of person. I doubt you smell like a bouquet of roses yourself.", "i mean, you\u2019re not wrong, she should have ended it way before this. they are only 6 months in, but it shouldn\u2019t have gotten this far. \n\na polite well trained older dog being forced to sleep outside in the car during winter because this dude is sensitive? after demanding it not even sleep in HER bed after 10 years?!? yes, ESH but he is absolutely TA", "that\u2019s ok, but that\u2019s not what this guy is describing either. i personally wouldn\u2019t get involved with someone who wasn\u2019t in a dog friendly situation, but i guess that\u2019s just where i\u2019m at in my life. if you have a situation where the dog is ok and both people are comfortable with what\u2019s happening that\u2019s between y\u2019all. \n\nthis guy kicked the dog out of HER bed and is making it sleep in the car when she comes to visit. this is not ok.", "OP said the house has hardwood floors in the post", "True, she should, but if she doesn't he needs to either let the dog inside or end the relationship. Or only spend time at her house I guess, but if the dog is important to her and he doesn't care abut it then they don't sound very compatible.", "I mean that dog was long with Lucy and has habits, needs, etc. It's not a new pup that can be retrained into an outdoog dog", "Lucy is an AH because of her proximity to OP and not standing up to them or disconnecting themselves from them. So YTA OP.", "yes! exactly ESH", "That's unfair. Op made his boundaries clear. He is allowed to have boundaries in his own home. If Lucy doesn't like them she doesn't need to date him.", "OP is not a bad person for not wanting dogs in his house.", "what a great bloke", "I have an indoor dog, and no way would I stay the night somewhere he wasn't allowed to stay inside overnight with him. If no one could watch him at my house, I'd just not go. But that's not the fault of whoever's place I'm going to, they can make any rule they like for their own house", "Exactly. ESH, but OP takes the cake.", "My thoughts also.\n\nA mild 3\u00b0C tonight but three nights ago it was minus 4. \n\nHardwood floors are easily swept.

It's not a cat.", "That's the definition of a preference\n\nIt's not his dog. Why would he want it in his house? He's not forcing the gf to come over and abuse the dog by leaving it outside or in the car. \n\nThe dog can literally just stay at home. If the dog can't, then the gf needs to stay at home. \n\n>It's dangerous to leave a dog alone in a car for that long.\n\nYeah, the gf is a total asshole. Op's not forcing or doing anything\n\n>Definitely not the time to leave them alone outside and in a car.\n\nStill gf. Not op", "Sorry to break it to you. But if you have dogs in your house your house smells of dog. I've never been to a dog owners house that doesn't.", "Why is she dating someone that doesn't want an indoor dog?", "I mean, this woman knows the dog isn't welcome inside and is choosing to bring it and lock it in the car instead of having someone else look after it. They havent been together that long and most people I know don't bring their dogs to their partners' houses, at least not that early on. That said, they wouldn't be able to live together as a couple, so if that's something either of them are interested in down the line, the relationship isn't really sustainable long-term.", "Yeah, they don't sound compatible, I agree. But for me, he is not the AH, it's her dog, she should be the one who takes care of it, and thinks about what's best for it.

It doesn't even get very cold in NYC, but it gets lower than *that*!", "Cool story. So it's fine to leave an elderly dog outside overnight so long as it's not considered \"cold\" by your personal geographical standards...?", "She said the dog goes outside for walks.", "they said they wipe the dog\u2019s feet after walks but it\u2019s probably a small enough dog to need a designated pee and poop pan in their home especially if they live in an apartment or don\u2019t have a dog door and yard. Dogs can absolutely be trained to relieve themselves in certain areas when necessary and can\u2019t make it outside.", "OP was clear that he didn't want an indoor dog, why gf dated him, having an indoor dog and wanting it to be inside his house?", "That's a fair point. both OP and gf are not the smartest then in choosing a partner that is clearly incompatible."]}
