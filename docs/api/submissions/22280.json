You want the dog to freeze to death? Put a canvas tarp on the floor. If you can't handle that Lucy has an indoor dog then maybe don't date Lucy. She must be really enamored with you if she was willing to put her poor dog in the car during summer so she can get the D at your place. \n\nAlso, just letting you know you can refinish hardwood floors. Not saying you should let a dog ruin them but if the dog is toilet trained and had clipped nails I don't see how it could be worse than human feet/shoes.", "Do what you like, but this new relationship won\u2019t last if her dog suffers during winter.", "ESH- her most of all for making her poor inside dog stay in the car, but you also for being okay with that. Neither of you are nice people, so you're kind of a perfect match. Unfortunately, there is a thinking, feeling animal that is being treated like an inanimate object so both of you can get some. Her dog is a hard boundary for you, nothing wrong with that, but a decent person would've insisted she find a place for her dog, or concluded that made you incompatible with each other.", "Jesus buddy, clip the dogs nails short or buy the some rubber footed mushing shoes to protect your floors and let it inside. GF has tried suggesting a reasonable alternative and you\u2019re shooting them down at every turn. You don\u2019t like the dog\u2019s *smell*? Please. Bathe it more often if it\u2019s a legitimate issue and not a cop out. \n\nAlso if you live in an area where winter temps get close to or below freezing, outdoor dogs require warmed areas for shelter - very few breeds can simply be left to fend for themselves in the elements. I\u2019ve owned working sled dogs and even we gave them heated sheds. So unless you plan on building a comfortable heated outdoor enclosure for this dog, leaving the dog in an unheated vehicle for hours on end could be reasonably construed as neglect. \n\nIf you care about this relationship, you need to get over this, because I would choose my senior dog\u2019s safety over a six month old relationship with an inflexible partner any day. At the end of the day you have the right to dictate the rules of your home, but GF will get rightly sick of this if you continue being so rigid. YTA", "YTA, and a cruel one at that.\n\nHopefully your gf wakes up, and realises that her dogs health and well being is more important than your floors.", "YTA, you need to find a way to compromise with her because at the end of the day, this dog is not new in her life and she cares about it. Leaving the dog outside for winter even in a car would be cruel. You don\u2019t have to have it in your bedroom or office but maybe another place? Is it a closed layout house?", "YTA - your gf is willing to compromise and has compromised, but you will be TA if you are not willing  to compromise as well.\n\nIn the end, you are making her choose between the dog and you, don't be surprised if she ends up choosing the dog.", "YTA. Your reasoning is poor, the dog isn\u2019t even doing anything wrong. My dog loves water and gets frequent baths and showers as he tends to hop in regardless if i want him to or not. He smells better than any burping farting dude I have lived with and I would have laughed in your face if you told me *after 10 years of sleeping with the dog* that you didn\u2019t want him in the bed. \n\nNow you don\u2019t even want the poor dog in the house during winter?? I hope Lucy comes to her senses.", "I want to say YTA, but I suspect you and I come from different cultures (where I live you don\u2019t leave dogs outside.

However there's no future in your relationship. Dogs don't just destroy houses, floors and furniture. Not if they're house trained, groomed, content and supervised. The house won't smell like dog if the dog gets bathed regularly. The house won't smell if you do a bit of light clean up on a daily basis. It's kinda the same as dating someone with a child and then restricting  the time that child spends at your household. It's your right to have a no dog preference but date a girlfriend that doesn't have a dog.", "This kinda seems like a deal breaker. \n\nYou don\u2019t like inside dogs (neither do I, mainly because of dog smell) and your girlfriend has an inside dog. \n\nGirlfriend and dog are a package deal. \n\nYou either bend your preferences and concede to the dog being inside (girlfriend has been really fair so far) or you break up with the girl. \n\nHow much do you like this woman? Enough to get used to dog smell? If yes, then stop being so prideful and set a bed up for the dog in back office. If no, then don\u2019t waste this poor woman\u2019s time any longer because you can not reasonably expect her to get rid of her beloved dog.\n\nYTA for not letting the dog inside. Not because you want to but because it\u2019s what is needed if you see this relationship lasting.", "YTA, and my dog agrees from her side of the bed.", "NTA, but your partner is for leaving their dog in a car overnight. \n\nYou do not leave your pets unattended in a vehicle. That's like pet owner 101.\n\nThe bottom line is that this relationship has no future. Like what's the game plan here? Just wait it out for however many years it takes the dog to die from old age? Otherwise you literally can't even move in together.", "YTA for making the dog an outside dog when you don't have adequate shelter for the dog outside and leaving it in a car. Lucy is also due to letting you treat her dog like that when the dog has never had experience of this before and will happily sleep in the house when her dog is locked inside a car overnight.", "YTA. Seems like only one side in this relationship is willing to make compromises.", "YTA. You can't leave the dog outside in the winter when it's not used to it. Have certain rooms the dog is allowed in and not others. Ultimately if this relationship is serious and you might end up living together you're going to have to compromise. Not all dogs can be outside dogs.", "NTA\n\nBut this relationship isn't going to work. There's nothing wrong with a pet free lifestyle...but her making the dog sleep in the car instead of getting a dog sitter at home is wrong... especially for an indoor dog. You 2 will never truly be able to live together comfortably.", "NAH, she doesn't want to change her very aged dog's lifestyle and it tells she is a good owner. You don't want inside dogs in your house and you talked it out beforehand. None of you is AH here.\nBut, Lucy needs to find better way than using a vehicle as a dog house. It may be building a shed if you allow or leaving her dog at home with a dog sitter, IDK. Anyway, you just need to make it work by not bending smbs comfort but by finding a new way that works for the both of you and a doggo", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
