He's been to the doctor to get bloodwork done to see if it's something medically. He isn't doing nothing. I don't let myself indulge as I'm not into sweets. I simply want to have my kids to have balance on healthy foods and unhealthy foods so they don't overindulge as an adult because said unhealthy foods being forbidden their whole childhood.\n\nInfo: I have let him look at this for his personal feedback, and his issue isn't addiction. It's impulse control.

The two of you need counseling, the fact that you can even think it's your fault is ridiculous, the fact that he can think a full grown adult is allowed to say they have no self control is ridiculous.\n\nI personally struggle with self-control over sweets and snacks, I try not to keep them in the house however I'm a full-grown adult and also know that I can only eat my fair share. I do appreciate my husband's support, however it's not his responsibility to control my behavior. If your husband genuinely believes that anybody other than himself is responsible for his behavior, I highly recommend some counseling for both of you. Aside from his own health, these are terrible conversations and behaviors for children to observe", "NAH\n\nWhile it's wrong of him to blame you for his lack of self control - some ppl do lack self control, haha. There's certain foods I don't keep in the house (cookies!) because I know what I am.

He wants to blame everybody else for his own actions and not take responsibility for himself.  This is absolutely the behavior of an addict -- and yes, compulsive overeating is an addiction.    NTA.

While your husband needs to get a handle on things, if he's going to drink all of the soda just because it's there, you & the kids aren't going to be able to have it anyway, right?\n\nNot having soda in the house isn't making it forbidden. It can be a treat when they go out.", "NTA.\n\nI do think that we can view this as weaponised incompetence. But let\u2019s say we believe him. Is that then equivalent of keeping alcohol at the home of an addict?\n\nI don\u2019t know which one it is but if it\u2019s the second, then maybe he has a point.\n\nAs for your children, impulse control is an important thing to teach. But instead of going out few times a year maybe you could go out more often? That sounds overall healthier. It\u2019s good for kids to go out and that way they can get soda without triggering your husband\u2019s issues?", "ESH. Also I\u2019m concerned that these issues will be wearing off on your very impressionable aged kids. Food is not inherently good or bad. If you make it a big deal that your husband is drinking soda your kids will pick up on this. If your husband continues to exclaim he has no self control your kids will pick up on this as a potential failure they don\u2019t want to make and can easily make this something that becomes a huge sticking point in their own relationship with food. I think you both need to relax around food and if your kids want to try a soda, buy them one each and not an entire case to keep at home. Or put their names on the cans/bottles and perhaps your husband won\u2019t drink them all. Or get him some as well so he isn\u2019t in an all or nothing mindset when he sees them", "NTA - get a mini fridge and padlock, why should your kids miss out on his lack of control since he wants to me a simpleton and not take accountability.\n\nHe needs therapy or something. Your not even saying he can\u2019t have soft drink, your just asking him not to drink it all! \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty great your teaching your kids yo be healthy which in this world incorporates \u201csometimes\u201d food. Good work mumma it can be tough.", "NTA  \n\n\nIf he has literally no self control, he needs counselling because that's a sign of mental illness. Good Luck o/", "NTA but if he tryly can't control himself he needs counseling or Overeaters Anonymous.", "NTA but he sure is. Claiming he doesn\u2019t have self control is ridiculous. Really it\u2019s that he chooses not to exercise restraint. He\u2019s a human not an animal. Get a spray bottle and hit him with water when he tries to go for the Sprite.", "Keep the sprite locked away, like if you have a car then keep it locked in your trunk where he can't access it. Then only take it out when you serve it to your kids and don't let him have any. I've struggled with binge eating since I was a teenager; it's hard but not impossible to control oneself. It's like if I go to a party I'm not going to eat all the food and leave nothing for no one else. Your husband needs to learn to control himself. It isn't easy, but it is something he could do. He just doesn't want to. NTA", "NTA.\n\nHe somehow finds the willpower outside the house to not drink soda, but when it's designated for the kids he's like a horse at a trough? That's such bullshit. Does he drink his coworkers soda and then tell them it's their fault for bringing it to work?", "Um, NTA. But your post history is yikes. You have more issues with him than just this.", "NTA, time to mix laxative into the sprite and soon husband will find a new way of self control. Might actually help him find self control by himself. Just keep it away from the kids.", "Ditch the Sprite. The kids don't need it either.", "ESH. You both know he has no self control and you're both not doing anything to help that issue.", "NTA, he's acting like a child. If you ask me, you should do it more often, don't care if he drinks it or not (but do buy separate cans of soda for the kids and open it for them). He will never learn self-control if you take away all the temptation. Plus, the FOUR of you shouldn't be \"suffering\" because he can't control himself.", "YTA. \n\nDecision fatigue is real.  And in many weightloss programs the first step is remove all temptations that are unhealthy. Remove chips, candy, soda, carbs. It's because if it's around its hard to resist if that's your thing. \n\nIf I don't like candy then you can have candy everywhere and it won't bother me but if my guilty pleasure is pasta don't be making pasta for dinner. That's mean. \n\n\nAs a partner you should work out something to support him. Like for instance communicating ahead of time a treat for kids you both agree on. And maybe even keeping it out of sight. For instance buying a 12 pack and keeping the can hidden and having them refrigerated just for the treat. Ofcourse asking your husband if he agrees first. \n\nSelf control is hard. You do not seem to understand that he has a problem. Couples therapy might help you both get on the same page to both respect his challenges and wanting to treat the kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You just don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d (and neither do most of these commenters) because you don\u2019t have the metabolic issues/body chemistry issues/whatever that he does. It\u2019s not \u201clack of self control\u201d or \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d. It really is kind of like putting a beer in front of an alcoholic.\n\nBecause of the way his body is, your husband could always eat. Even right after a big meal, he could probably find room for more. When he\u2019s eating in a way that is objectively reasonable for his height/weight/health needs, he\u2019s always feeling like he\u2019s starving. Like, it\u2019s been two hours since lunch and he\u2019s feeling how you\u2019d feel if you skipped a whole day of meals while doing manual labor. He thinks about food\u2014what he\u2019s eaten, what he\u2019s eating next, what\u2019s in the house\u2014all the time. Even when he\u2019s doing other things, it\u2019s in the back of his head. This is his normal. He may not even realize that most people don\u2019t live like this\u2014that most people are really not hungry most of the day. I cannot express how much harder it is to stay out of the junk food when this is your life. You really don\u2019t intend to eat all of your kids\u2019 ice cream. But it\u2019s gone, and you did it. Again. Now you feel like a fat, disgusting, selfish pig and you have to go buy a new thing of ice cream. Even though it\u2019s probably going to be you that eats this one too. Sometimes you can make it a whole week (if you don\u2019t go in the kitchen and white knuckle through it). Then at least your kid gets some of it. This is the reality of these kind of food/weight issues. It\u2019s not really a psychological problem, it\u2019s physical. But medicine has no solution for it\u2014just \u201chave more self control\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s not realistic. You\u2019re setting your husband up for failure and setting your kids up for food issues. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t buy that\u201d or \u201cmom only buys that when we\u2019re out and about\u201d is way less damaging than \u201cI have to eat it all now or I won\u2019t ever get to have any\u201d or even than a fridge lockbox.", "If he was an alcoholic would you bring alcohol into the house? Soft YTA because you should know he's an addict and you're not helping him by bringing that stuff into the house. I can't believe all the NTA votes, do people really not know that food addiction is a thing? \n\nSurely you can treat your kids to soda when you're out or even have a couple of cans at home when he's not there but keeping a constant supply of it isn't helping your husband.", "This is Mutually Assured Destruction level of Weaponized.

Not keeping it in the house is a perfectly healthy balance.", "Just to be clear, I voted \"ESH\" but I don't think either of you are really bad enough to be \"assholes\" but more \"both responsible\" rather than \"both assholes\". \n\nWhat did you expect to happen when you know he has bad self control and you brought in soda for the kids? \n\nAnd It's definitely not right for him to blame you for his relapses.\n\nHas he ever thought about seeking therapy for his complete lack of self control?
