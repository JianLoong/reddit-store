{"id": 16382, "submission_id": "137togk", "title": "AITA for telling my dad he can come to my wedding if he pays me $1500?", "selftext": "I am 27, and I have one sister who is 26 and my parents are together still. My best friend since middle school is Houston (27M) . Our junior year of college my sister and him started dating. I was pissed at first but came around to it because how serious he was about her. They got married back in 2017 and had a kid in 2018. I was a very proud and involved  uncle. \n\nEverything was great till like 2019 when my sister had a falling out with her friend who then told me that Houston\u2019s kid wasn\u2019t his. To save characters here the kid wasn\u2019t his. A total shit show after involving a divorce, child support, and elimination of custody. I told my sister during this process she was dead to me as she not only fucked over my best friend, but lied to me in the process and allowed me to spend thousands of dollars on her kid. $1000 between gifts and a nursery, plus I\u2019d estimate I spent close to 500 hours babysitting. \n\nI then found out my mom knew the whole time because my sister told her. I called mom out in person and she lost it. I said Houston has been in her house for a decade. How could she lie to him and defend my sister (she never has held my sister accountable). She told me to shut up because a parent will defend their kid. I called her a bad person who raised a shitty daughter who now has a bastard child. My dad told me to stop. I asked if he knew and he said no. I said he\u2019s either a liar or chump whose wife lied to him for years. We haven\u2019t had a relationship since this all went down in 2019. \n\nI left in 2020 to be closer to Houston after he got a job in another state. I met my fianc\u00e9 thru his girlfriend and our wedding is slated for 2024. My dad saw my engagement post on Houston\u2019s Facebook (I\u2019ve blocked all my family) and reached out to Houston. Saying how he\u2019s been sick and wanted to repair our relationship. We\u2019ve been doing that slowly over the past few months. He was sick for a time after I left but is now better. He said my mom is distraught but her pride won\u2019t allow her to apologize. My sister is apologetic and wants to reconcile but I don\u2019t care about that kid or my sister at all. He understands why. \n\nThe whole reason for the post is dad wants an invite to the wedding. He is getting old and doesn\u2019t know if he will get sick again so he wants to repair out relationship. I told him that if he were to get an invite it would be solo. He said that will lead to more drama and thinks inviting my family would repair some of the damage. I said the damage isn\u2019t mine to repair. He married a shitty person and raised a crap daughter so those actions are his to deal with. Since my sister now lives with them and has no money he\u2019s responsible. I said I\u2019d charge $1 a hour for the babysitting. The nursery was a grand. So if he wants to be invited he will need to send a check for that. He said he will think it all over and let me know this weekend. My fianc\u00e9 agreed I should be paid back monetarily for the money I spent under false pretenses. AITA?\n\nEdit: for those asking why I feel entitled to money. I went above and beyond for this kid because I thought it was my best friends kid. I never liked my sister all that much. I would have never invested the money I did if I knew.", "created_utc": 1683220593, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137togk/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_can_come_to_my_wedding/", "score": 632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Charging your dad money for something your sister did is illogical.  Sounds to me like you're just wanting cash.  \n\nBe pissed at your sister all you want.  Be angry that your mother knew and hid the fact.  But your dad and the child had nothing to do with any of this.", "YTA. None of this is on your dad. Your reasoning is bananas, and a bit unhinged.", "YTA. I'm just going to address your direct question because the messiness across this situation is out of control. First, this is your niece regardless of whether she is Houston's or not. In any other circumstance, you'd still shower your niece with gifts. I get being mad at your sister for her actions, but at the end of the day, the child is blameless. She did nothing to you. The things you gifted her and the hours of babysitting should be because you loved her - and nothing more. Second, why would your dad be responsible for anything? He isn't your sister or your mom. Why are you holding him accountable with a threat of not attending the wedding? Seems super petty and unkind to your Dad who by your words - wasn't involved.", "INFO: It's not clear to me why you disowned your nephew and were so upset that you spent so much time babysitting the kit/so much money on gifts for the kid. Are you saying if your sister had had a kid with anyone other than your best friend, you *wouldn't* have bought that child gifts or babysat? Can you please clarify that part of the conflict?", "YTA - You have a right to be pissed at your sister, but\n\n1. You've severed your relationship with your nephew because his dad isn't who you thought he was? \n2. You're pissed at your dad because he, like you, didn't know that your sister was cheating on your friend?\n3. You're holding a grudge against your mom because she chose to keep the peace after learning that your sister cheated on your friend?\n\nThis isn't how normal adults behave. \n\nAlso, your demand to be compensated for babysitting under false pretenses is a bizarre and petty. \n\nIt's kind of impressive that you're actually a bigger asshole than your sister.", "YTA\n\nYoure acting like you were cheated on. Your father didn't harm you. He can't control who your adult sister allows in to her vagina. You need to actually think instead of just reacting.", "INFO: is the money really that important to you, or is it the principle of the situation?", "YTA \n\nYour dad had nothing to do with your sister cheating. That is on her, not him. You are acting entitled to a situation that you are not directly involved in.", "YTA I kept expecting to get to the bit where you confessed your love to your friend and are now marrying him, as your reaction is waaaay too personal for something that doesn't directly involve you. \n\nYour sister betrayed her husband, your mum kept quiet about it. None of this happened to you. Demanding money for presents back because it's not your kid would be weird, but understandable, but because it's not your friends kid? Super weird. You got presents for your nephew, who is still your nephew. If it was your friends side of the family making these demands it would still be weird, bit at least understandable.\n\nMeanwhile, you've disowned your dad for no apparent reason, other than being a drama queen.", "YTA\n\nWTF that you would charge your (ill?) father for your SISTER's lies. She owes you if anyone but not him. Also who retroactively charges babysitting? Absurd and greedy.\n\nYou don't get to punish everyone around you for injustice. You aren't judge and jury.\n\nTalk about entitled and greedy.", "Wow YTA.\n\nYou want to ransom an invite to your wedding for your father to repay expenses that **weren\u2019t for him or about him**. Got an issue with your sister over money you spent on your niece/nephew? Take it up with your sister.\n\nHe\u2019s better off without you, what an unbelievably horrid way for you to act. I am sorry he has to deal with you at all, do him a favor and include him with the rest of your family. Enjoy Houston.", "YTA.  None of this is your dad\u2019s fault, and you are using emotional extortion to get money.\n\nAlso, these events happened 3 to 4 years ago, and you seem to still carry a lot of rage about it even though you were not the central victim in this, Houston was.  Therapy might be a good idea to work through your anger and figure out why you are inserting yourself into Houston\u2019s place here.  That doesn\u2019t mean you have to pretend this never happened, but might emotionally healthier for you.", "YTA.

I get you're upset that your sister cheated on your best friend and lied about him being the dad, but I'm confused. He is still your nephew. Why should you be paid back for spending money on your biological nephew, regardless of who the dad is? You keep saying that your mom raised a shitty daughter but you def are being shitty too. I can't believe your fiance agrees. I bet she secretly doesn't but you're so busy being on your moral high ground you don't notice.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit for niece.", "YTA.\n\nYou dad didn't know.

He wants to be involved. His mortality is on the horizon. Be the man your dad raised and invite him with no strings attached. Just make it clear that mom and sister are absolutely not invited under any circumstances.", "The only problem here is that you stopped loving a child that did nothing wrong.\n\nYTA. This kid didn't deserve to lose an uncle over the actions of his mothers. Also, you father doesn't owe you shit, neither does your sister. Those were gifts and freely given time.", "Don't get me wrong. I get siding with your friend who was wronged over your sister. Likewise I get siding with him over your Mom who supported and excused her shitty behavior. Whether you want to reconcile with her or not is entirely your choice, and you are N T A whether you choose to or not. Similarly, it is your choice with your dad, but you seem kind of hellbent in your description of simply not caring whether he knew... especially if it is the latter, you are only compounding his hurt for something he had no control over in the first place.\n\n  \nAdditionally... one side thing that strikes me and is worth pointing out... The kid is innocent, and I realize it is a sore spot since it was your best friend who got fucked over, but putting the sins of the mother on the son isn't fair. I would hope you aren't taking this attitude towards him in life as a whole, and exiling him from involvement in his family for something he had no say in (being born), but that does seem like your plan? \n\n  \nIn any case though, making your father pay you back for the money you spent on your nephew feels like this takes it from \"I'm really hurt and can never get over this\" to \"actual vengeance\" - and against the wrong person to boot - and it also just makes it feel like you're putting the poor kid as a pawn in the middle of this *(if anything, if your family is as screwy as you present them here, Lord knows that kid needs someone with a moral backbone in their life to provide them a role model...).*\n\n  \nSetting boundaries and conditions for a reconciliation is perfectly fine and healthy, but this doesn't seem like a healthy one. To be sure, you made an olive branch of him coming Solo, which *is* good, fine, healthy, and all that, and the \"You need to pay\" is only if he brings the others... but like... that is just such a *not constructive response* to try and effect this reconciliation with your father.\n\nIf you had actual proof your Dad knew and abetted, I would say E - S - H here, but seeing as you actually don't and just don't care, I have to go with YTA  *(the closest thing to make it acceptable would be \"OK, sis can come if she pays\", but don't put that on your father)*. \n\nCall up your dad, arrange to meet somewhere neutral and private and have a freaking conversation with him and try and work things out. You made an offer, he made a couteroffer which might not be reasonable... but try and find an *actual* way to reconcile rather than just tossing back \"OK pay me\"? I think you both have some trauma that isn't really being processed well and you need to have a real heart to heart about it all.\n\nTLDR: If you actually care about reconciling with your father, *meet up with him and talk things over.* If you don't... then don't even make this offer because you aren't going to make it happen this way.", "Esh (except your friend I guess). If only Jerry Springer were still here.", "YTA-OP is in love with Houston and very much in denial.", "Why exactly are you taking this out on your dad?  \n\nHe's the only family member that had nothing to do with anything.  \n\nYTA", "So are you in love with Houston or your sister because this is an absolutely unhinged response.

Something is wildly out of proportion here. \n\nSo if your parents raised a shitty daughter, they raised you too, correct? \n\nI get being mad at your sister for cheating on her husband. That\u2019s bad regardless of whether the husband was your best friend. But it\u2019s also between them. She didn\u2019t cheat on *you*.

I don't think money fixes this. Also, if you get the money, what then? Are you going to be happy with mom and sister again? Because that absolutely will be the expectation, even if you insist it shouldn't be an outcome it will be the expectation of the money transfer.\n\nI think the best thing is to invite dad, solo, no money. If he understands your position he will do this to work on mending things with you. This feels like two people meeting in the middle.\n\nIf he refuses to come w/ out mom, or worse brings her when he says he won't, then you'll know how serious he is or isn't about mending things.", "ESH You should just stay no contact with your family.

That was as good as someone stabbing your family in the back.\n\nHowever, I feel the money you're demanding was effectively just a method of getting your pound of flesh in the ensuing drama. You have every right to tell them to go fuck themselves and keep away, but that money isn't really something you're seeing back.

You sound like you have such constant rage, if you don't wanna deal with it or reconcile fine but just no contact your dad once again.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, you are definitely ta for bullying your dad when he just wants to have a relationship with his son, however your mum and sister are total ah\u2019s and hopefully your dad will blame put blame on them for this, your mother is absolutely terrible and your sister should self delete. Hope your dad does make it to the wedding solo and hope the wedding does go ahead. Also you should tell your dad to bill your mum and sister, not him. Also i find that people are saying op is punishing his nephew, how? By not seeing him? By not being in his life? That\u2019s pathetic reasoning, uncles and aunts aren\u2019t always generally close to their nephews and nieces, hopefully ops nephew will realise how despicable his mother is when he\u2019s older", "NTA - sounds like a super toxic ass family. Create your own family out of state like you have been. Sometimes when the situation is bad enough your chosen family is 100x better than your actual family would ever be. The folks saying YTA have never dealt with enough family trauma to cut them off completely. This entire thing is relative to what you consider unforgivable. You set the boundaries, up to you how you want to proceed as far as your dad being invited.", "NTA people are saying your dad did absolutely nothing wrong when he essentially sided with the mum and daughter and just doesn't seem to care about what happened, also saying OP is punishing the kid as if the kid really cares about not talking to their uncle/aunt. What is OP supposed to do anyway, he doesn't talk to his sister he can't really just hang around with her kid.", "I'm gonna go ahead and say NTA. The comments here are wild. Both parents turned your sister into a monster and, in the end, it is %100 % up to him to stay with your mom despite him knowing that his partner knew that their daughter cheated and still decided to stay with her. If my partner knew this about our child, I'd be furious. Especially if the child is with their other daughters best friend. I might be in the minority here but your thoughts on this make total sense to me and I would've cut contact with them too. I think you're justified in wanting money and only wanting your dad to come. If he's feeling sick and wants to repair the relationship, then he needs to suck it up and pay back the money and put the work in. While it may not be his fault that his wife sucks, he found out about it and did nothing. This is also assuming he actually didn't know about it. But anyways I might get hate for this, but to me all the YTA's on here are wild so I wanted to say that at least on person here gets what you're saying and would also have done what you done.\n\nAlso, to address all the \"the child is innocent\" stuff I see on here. Yes, the child doesn't need to be punished at all, but you also gave a bunch of stuff to a child that will only cause you pain to look at. While I don't think you should be a dick to the child, not wanting to see them and wanting to be paid back makes sense to me. Especially since you went above and beyond for that child, assuming it was your sister and best friends baby", "NTA, Blood doesn't make you family as so many like to say, except when it involves a child. You say you never really liked your sister, you only dealt with her & the kid because you thought your best friend was the dad. Your sis lied & your mom lied not just to try & save face but money & support for the kid. They both knew that you wouldn't help if you knew the truth. Is it harsh what you said to your dad, but people ignore the bullshit he tried to pull to invite 2 snakes to your wedding. I'd honestly hit him with the samething. He doesn't get to make a request for your wedding. My grandparents are big against cheating, you get disowned & if someone tries to defend them, they get disowned.", "So here\u2019s my reasoning. He is allowing her to live at his house. Meaning he\u2019s taking responsibility for her. He either lied to me. Or is saying married to a liar. He did other petty things to me once I left as well. At some point he needs pay up or make my sister do it.", "Agreed YTA. \u201cUnhinged\u201d Is the best word choice here", "Trying to claw back emotional sunk costs for care given to an innocent child is indeed unhinged. If OP wants to cut off his entire family over this, that\u2019s his right, but this \u201cpay me $1500\u201d bit is not going to do anyone any good.", "Agree with YTA and unhinged. This can't be real... The kid is still his niece but he wants nothing to do with a kid that did nothing wrong, just like the dad did nothing wrong...and he wants money. And he moved away to be close to his best friend who is still in touch with his family. I'm not sure why OP is taking his sister's infidelity so personally.", "Agreed.  OP is lashing out at the wrong people here.  And not wanting anything to do with their niece makes them a huge AH.  But maybe it's best for the child that they don't have a relationship with OP.  I sure wouldn't.", "It\u2019s petty and mean spirited.", "Agreed. I\u2019m worried for the person he\u2019s marrying\u2026", "It it totally unhinged, but let me explain what OP didn\u2019t include because even he knows at an intellectual level that it\u2019s crazy and wouldn\u2019t reflect well on him:\n\nHe has to go through the crazy double betrayal of his friend and sister fucking, eventually comes around based on the depth of their love, and then finds out that actually his sister is trying to trick the friend into raising another man\u2019s kid and that she didn\u2019t love him at all, the whole relationship *was* just his sister using the people around OP to dominate him and put him in his place as he had suspected during his lowest points during the original betrayal. \n\nThat could make anyone go insane. I can see the insane logic of wanting the money. It\u2019s not about the compensation for his time and money spent on the niece. It\u2019s about extracting some sort of reparations out of them so he feels he can speak to them on an even level with his dignity intact. OP feels that his sister was acting at least partly out of intentional interest in antagonizing him, and watching his family focus on supporting her without acknowledging her \u201cabuse\u201d of OP feels like a betrayal. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they have told her from the very beginning to stay away from my friends?

I bet he\u2019d be back to buying presents for his niece by the next week. \n\nOP knows that will never happen. So he thinks, if they pay him \u201creparations\u201d for their betrayal, he could at least speak with them with his dignity intact, he\u2019d  at least have extracted reasonable compensation for his suffering out of them, what he really wanted is to feel that they love him as much as his sister, but he\u2019d be willing to compromise. \n\nWhich isn\u2019t a very clear eyed way to view the world, but these sibling and family relationships can get messy and drive people pretty batty.", "I\u2019m at a loss about a whole lot of this rage.

The whole thing about a scam is that it has to be done on purpose. And unless OP told the sister they wanted nothing to do with the kid unless it was biologically her husband's, I don't see how the sister could be held responsible for accepting gifts she couldn't have known OP wouldn't buy if they knew otherwise.

I couldn't tell you!\"?\n\nThe situation in the OP is the same sort of idea. Mom knew, and let poor Houston spend 1000's of dollars, devote years of his life, under a false pretense.

The whole way it took me so long to figure out OP was a man because I just was like okay well obviously she's in love with him and that's why shes SO upset by this.

This completely overlooks the FACT that he can't have a relationship with that child unless he is at least cordial with their mother and the FACT that if any other rando had done this to an OP instead of an OP's friend we would all be screaming how terrible of a person she is and anyone in her life that doesn't want to be involved with her anymore would be justified in cutting her off.\n\nIt's not about who was cheated on, it's about the fact that OP found out his sister and mother are capable of life shattering lies and he doesn't want people like that in his life.\n\nLucky for you, this isn't a debate. You're being ridiculous implying an uncle cutting of his siter for perfectly justifiable means constitutes abandonment", "You appreciate that having a relationship with a niece or nephew requires a relationship with their guardian, correct?\n\nI don't think it is as ridiculous as you're making it out to be if a guy was to say \"I dislike my sister very much and therefore will not be present in her Childrens lives.\"\n\nHe has no obligation to be an \"uncle\" and if the deciding factor in him being in that Childs life was whether or not said child is his best friends, then I think that is completely reasonable.\n\nTake them as two separate subjects.\n\nAre you allowed to dislike your sister and therefore not be involved in her immediate family? Yes or No?\n\nAre you allowed to be involved in given Childs life (with the parents permission obv) purely because that child belongs to a close friend? Yes and No?\n\nI think most reasonable people in a vacuum would say yes to both of those statements... So enlighten, what about those two facts in conjunction makes either one of them a no?

He is most likely just indifferent to the child.", "I feel like you're deluding yourself so you don't have to actually ask yourself \"Wait, why do other people, not personally involved, think differently? Am I perhaps wrong?\"", "Well the simple fact of the matter is even if she went and got a job she still likely wouldn't be able to afford even a studio.\n\nYou need to actually employ some critical thinking and stop acting like a little tyrant because your dad won't allow his daughter and grandchildren to be homeless.", "Please don\u2019t have children.", "But what does that have to do with you being mad about her lying to your friend? These are completely unrelated things. What are you actually mad about?", "Why do you care?", "I think you meant too old because he certainly hasn\u2019t grown up.", "To be fair, intentional paternity fraud is a massive wrong and pretty unforgivable, so I think it\u2019s fine that he cut off his sister and mom.

I am glad you have loyalty to your friends. Who's to say later down the road that Houston will have the same blind loyalty as you.

Who has the agency in that sentence? The kids who stopped coming. Now, let's say you left the daycare with kids still inside and without adult supervision. I wonder what that would legally be called..... maybe abandonment? \n\nThis will really blow your mind: if the sister cheated and her husband left the home and relationship, that is ALSO called abandonment (certainly grammatically, perhaps legally in some situations). It might be justified, but that is what it is. To abandon to you have to have the agency in a situation. For example, you can abandon your house, your house cannot abandon you.", "Yes cause these random kids who aren't your family no longer going to a place you work at is exactly the same thing as  OP dropping out of his nephews life entierly after having been a doting and caring uncle.\n\nIts quite telling that neither you nor OP can actually consider the child.", "Are you actually saying that single moms can\u2019t provide more for their kids than studios?

This has got to be a lot for you, huh.\n\nI was merely implying that there is a spectrum here by which we can measure your importance in a Childs life, and I believe uncle is well below the threshold of constituting \"abandonment\".\n\nYou can't just disagree with my premise by saying \"you're not considering the kid.\" It's facile; there is not argument being made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is clear that his relationship with his sister has been **justifiably** damaged beyond repair in any near future by his sister.
