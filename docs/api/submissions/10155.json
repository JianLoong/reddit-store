She went on to blame my wife by saying she purposely went into labor right around her birthday in order to \"steal her spotlight from her son\" which I found really weird to say. From this comment alone I got annoyed and just told her to leave me and my wife alone and that she isn't welcome at our house for the next few days, she can't wait till she's over her fit to see her granddaughter.\n\nMy whole family have been calling me and asshole and that I am a bad son for not remembering my moms birthday, but I'm an even worse son for not letting her meet her grandbaby.

I mean, I'm glad that you stick up for your wife against your mother, but your mom has shown that she will never accept your wife. Why would you want your loved ones to deal with that kind of toxicity? Especially your child, who is half your wife as well as half you.\n\nI've seen what happens in households like yours, and the fallout is not pretty. Once your child starts hearing awful things about their mother, they usually end up questioning if something is wrong with themselves too, since after all, it's their mother they're hearing stuff about, and they end up thinking that the crap that they're hearing must be true, since their parents didn't cut off the source of the BS or put them in check. \n\nYour progeny is just a baby, and there's still a chance to make things right with your wife, who must be an amazing woman, not only for being in labor for 48 hours, but also not going ballistic when your mother said that she went into labor on purpose, which i wish was possible to do without drugs. Your wife is a saint for not leaving you since you allow your mother in your lives. \n\nPlease go NC with your mom if you truly love your wife. Patience wears thin, and your wife can only deal with so much before she gets fed up. I would have left  a long time ago if I had to deal with your mother's BS, and I know many women who would do the same.\n\nLook, if your mom loved you, she would accept and respect your wife as her DIL, and mother to her grandbaby, instead of disparaging your wife to your face and to everyone else that she can get to hear her. \n\nAlso, please cut off anyone that tries to defend your mother and tries to say you're a bad son for not putting up with your mother's shenanigans. Again, like I said before, your wife, your baby, your immediate family basically, doesn't need to be exposed to that kind of toxicity and you're putting your family at risk of being split apart if you don't put your foot down now. \n\nI wish you the best of luck bro, regardless of what you decide to do. I want you to know whether you realize it or not, you're making a choice every time your mother comes around and spews her BS, and regardless of if you stick up for your wife or not, you're choosing your mother over your wife by just allowing your mother to be around you guys.", "NTA, how exactly does she think your wife *deliberately* started labour?

You absolutely did nothing wrong in this and your mom needs to take a serious look at herself.", "I do NOT understand why a grown woman demand to be the center of attention and that everyone has to focus on her and ONLY her on birthdays, mothers' day and that any other woman (or man) who is recognized/celebrated on HER day is \"obviously\" doing it on purpose to \"steal her thunder\".  GROW UP, WOMEN.  QUIT ACTING LIKE 2 year olds!!", "NTA", "NTA are you sure you're her son? She doesn't seem to know how pregnancy works.", "I have but she said something along the lines of \"I'm your mother you don't get to question me.\" And went off. We slightly cut contact after that but not enough apparently", "This message means a lot to me. Thank you so much. I want my little girl to know how she should always be treated by the man or woman she decides to marry when she's older, I think me showing her that I love her mom by doing things to prove my love will be a great start", "Aw that's so sweet", "Definitely wasn't fun or controllable so if my mom thought my wife went into that state for fun then she is delusional", "Of course my baby and wife will always come before anymore else. And yeah she didn't even ask how Amelia was at all", "Thank you, we are definitely just being a little family right now. Amelia needs the rest and we just don't have energy for people other then us right now", "By the Saturday (my moms birthday) my wife was literally in tears from pain and I wanted to be with her through that because it's not fair on her to go through that alone. So I also wasn't able to think of anything other then her and our baby's health. It was a bit annoying I forgot my moms birthday and it's ok for her to feel a bit upset but to the extent she was taking it, that's too far.\n\nYes I'm still figuring out what our relationship with my mom will be like now", "Thank you so much", "I love the idea of it just being me and my little family for the first few weeks honestly", "Oh you are for sure right. My beautiful baby would of stolen my moms spotlight for sure if she was at the party", "I apologised as it can be upsetting but she didn't even bother to ask if Amelia was ok or if anything went well", "I understand that. I'm leaning to that direction for my little girls sake, I don't want her to grow up around a selfish grandma", "Thank you", "I've just looked at this sub and I wanna share more about her ok there. Thank you", "She had 7 kids", "If she was, I bet she would have birthed your baby faster so she wasn\u2019t miserable for DAYS! WTH\nNTA - I had my second a couple days before my moms birthday and don\u2019t think I even wished her a happy birthday. She DID NOT CARE. She was too excited for another grandbaby. Sounds like your mom is a bit nutty and \u201cit\u2019s all about me\u201d. Good luck", "Enjoy your new baby but don\u2019t hate your mom. She\u2019s not the first lonely older lady to compete with a daughter in law for her son. Its actually verycommon. It\u2019s harder for older women to date than older men, it\u2019s a numbers game. \n\nShe still loves you the same way your wife loves your new baby, more than likely unconditionally. We\u2019re all human and misdirect things. Your mother is wrong but she deserves grace and forgiveness. Don\u2019t mention anything to your wife though. She doesn\u2019t need the stress right now and you\u2019ll only end up feeling pulled in two directions. \n\nThis is the burden a lot of sons of single mothers have to carry when we get married. It sucks and it\u2019s not discussed as much as it should be.", "Oh, so she knows how birth works then? So she's just a narcissist.", "Or very very talented!", "Then that's the way to go. Look up some reputable websites that will tell you all about babies immune systems and how underdeveloped they are and send them to your mother and tell her the doctor recommended nobody visits until then. Boundaries are healthy and it's ok to keep people away for a while. Congrats on baby!", "A former coworker\u2019s husband and dad shared a birthday. Then their first daughter was born on the same day. She\u2019d always joke with both of them that no one could beat the birthday present she gave them\ud83d\ude02", "Someone I knew from secondary school share the same birth day as their dad", "I would find it so funny if I shared a birthday or birthday weekend with a grand baby because how special and sweet is that! I don't see my moms view either", "That's what I'm saying! My wife was miserable all those days she was overdue. Our baby would of been here weeks ago if it was up to her!", "She gave birth 7 times. Idk she claims that she was able to go into labor whenever she really tried to do so and accuses my wife of doing the same. But my wife was overdue anyway so naturally for all the time she was overdue we were trying to start her labor but never meant for it to fall on my mother's birthday weekend", "That's a good idea!", "The thing is she's ruined every relationship she's ever been in and that's why. She's always been toxic to my wife and its not something I can put up with. I've pulled her up on it and she denies it", "Me and my wife are big hogs of our newborn lol, neither of us want to put her down. I'm honestly all for spending the first few weeks hogging our baby to ourselves and then letting people meet her after a while. Thank you", "Ok now I need to know what's the occasion 9 months prior that leads to all of you having such similar birthdays.", " Congratulations with your beautiful baby.", "It's the sweetest thing ever.  We share a cake that is only ours and do fun stuff on her list.  Because we celebrate for the whole week, we get a lot of stuff in. \n\nI must say, the weekend she made her appearance was the best birthday ever.  I think I just held her and stared at her for hours and hours.  Absolute perfection.", "I share a birthday with my middle son (he's 6) and always make a big deal of telling him how he is the most special birthday present I've ever gotten, I make our favourite foods, I just think it's really awesome. \n\nYour mom sounds like a real Main Character piece of work. Definitely take a whooooooole lot of steps back.", "Add that it was a long and rough delivery but everyone is OK now, although there were some worrisome times.  Let your other relatives know that your mom chose to plan a big birthday party and drama on your wife's due date due to her jealousy over \"having to share the spotlight from you\" which makes you extremely uncomfortable as there's no competition between day's long painful labor vs a birthday party and your mom needs therapy, not you calling up to apologize for being 100% present while her grandchild was being born. Tell them & her that she won't meet your child until she starts therapy.  Not only is the baby half of wife, but is yet another person to steal the spotlight & your mom needs to chill out & figure out why she's having all these issues. NTA.", "I honestly don't like doing stuff like that but as I'm sure you understand some family don't listen enless there is some big thing that puts them in their place.  Mine was when my mother barged into my house when my son was a month old, went through his cloths and demanded I change him into that specific piece of clothing. When I told her she can't come over without calling she told my entire family she wasn't allowed in my house anymore", "The only thing you can do with a narcissist is to pull back and use the grey rock method on them. Just be boring and don't give in to their manipulation and demands.\n\nCurrently the flying monkeys are after you as you've stopped helping to steady the boat, and because of that its your fault, not the person rocking the boat on purpose. \n\nI'm sorry though, I'd hate to be going you what you are.", "That's so sweet. It must of been the best birthday present ever", "Aw that's so sweet to share a birthday with your boy.", "I understand completely! \n\nI was afraid something would go wrong with the baby if we would wait longer. So I was induced.\n\nGood luck with the last hours or days. I hope you will have your baby soon enough!", "My baby and wife come before her. Making this post has really helped me realise I need to do something about her toxic behaviour", "Lmao. Congratulations! I hope the delivery goes well", "Twinsies! Even if not the same year or parent lol", "Oh, it was.  And still is.  There is nothing like those two babies of hers.  They are the best little souls to ever enter this world.", "Thank you so much! Sending love and happiness from one family to another \ud83d\ude0a", "I bet", "Lots of love from us to you too! \ud83d\ude18"]}
