My mom never was a huge fan of my wife for reasons I will never know but I don't care as I love Amelia so much and I've had to defend her against my mom multiple times.\n\nMy wife's labor lasted much longer then we expected, she started on Thursday evening and delivered our baby on Monday during the very early hours of the morning.

We both agreed before hand that when the time came we would send the initial text that the baby was coming but that would be it and we wouldn't respond to any other text until after.\n\nWell my baby girl was finally born and we announced it to our family. Then I got to replying to my messages from the past few days and that's when I saw my mom text about it being her birthday and she sent a few more after, expressing her anger for me not getting in contact. \n\nSo I called her up apologising but explaining that I genuinely forgot and it wasn't intentional. She went on to blame my wife by saying she purposely went into labor right around her birthday in order to \"steal her spotlight from her son\" which I found really weird to say. From this comment alone I got annoyed and just told her to leave me and my wife alone and that she isn't welcome at our house for the next few days, she can't wait till she's over her fit to see her granddaughter.\n\nMy whole family have been calling me and asshole and that I am a bad son for not remembering my moms birthday, but I'm an even worse son for not letting her meet her grandbaby.

Wife and baby come first.", "Nta but turn off your phone. You don't need to take that from anyone, family or not", "NTA man. Not like a it should've been a surprise to your mother that the baby would be due around her bday. Planning a big to-do for the bday and then being mad when the (way more important completely predictable) baby happened just makes it seem like she was just looking for this fight (particularly so if she doesn't typically have a big bday party and/or it's not a 'big one' like 60th or 70th)", "NTA. Your mom should have understood when you told her you were with your wife in labor.

Your mother sounds irrationally jealous and unstable, and your wife does not need to deal with that right now.", "Wwwwowwww. \n\nIt\u2019s rather amazing to see that your mother has gotten so much buyin for her narcissistic behaviour. \n\nYou are doing right by YOUR family; set stone walls up around behaviour and words and guard them zealously. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Hard boundaries with your mom and don\u2019t leave her alone with your wife at all while she\u2019s recovering if she was that nasty with you who knows what she\u2019ll say to your wife.
