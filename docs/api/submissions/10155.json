She went on to blame my wife by saying she purposely went into labor right around her birthday in order to \"steal her spotlight from her son\" which I found really weird to say.

I mean, I'm glad that you stick up for your wife against your mother, but your mom has shown that she will never accept your wife. Why would you want your loved ones to deal with that kind of toxicity? Especially your child, who is half your wife as well as half you.\n\nI've seen what happens in households like yours, and the fallout is not pretty. Once your child starts hearing awful things about their mother, they usually end up questioning if something is wrong with themselves too, since after all, it's their mother they're hearing stuff about, and they end up thinking that the crap that they're hearing must be true, since their parents didn't cut off the source of the BS or put them in check. \n\nYour progeny is just a baby, and there's still a chance to make things right with your wife, who must be an amazing woman, not only for being in labor for 48 hours, but also not going ballistic when your mother said that she went into labor on purpose, which i wish was possible to do without drugs. Your wife is a saint for not leaving you since you allow your mother in your lives. \n\nPlease go NC with your mom if you truly love your wife. Patience wears thin, and your wife can only deal with so much before she gets fed up. I would have left  a long time ago if I had to deal with your mother's BS, and I know many women who would do the same.\n\nLook, if your mom loved you, she would accept and respect your wife as her DIL, and mother to her grandbaby, instead of disparaging your wife to your face and to everyone else that she can get to hear her. \n\nAlso, please cut off anyone that tries to defend your mother and tries to say you're a bad son for not putting up with your mother's shenanigans. Again, like I said before, your wife, your baby, your immediate family basically, doesn't need to be exposed to that kind of toxicity and you're putting your family at risk of being split apart if you don't put your foot down now. \n\nI wish you the best of luck bro, regardless of what you decide to do. I want you to know whether you realize it or not, you're making a choice every time your mother comes around and spews her BS, and regardless of if you stick up for your wife or not, you're choosing your mother over your wife by just allowing your mother to be around you guys.", "NTA, how exactly does she think your wife *deliberately* started labour?

Congrats to you and your wife on the new addition!", "NTA. My god,  i knew labor could go on for a while but never knew it could go on for THAT long. Your wife deserves a Mother\u2019s Week instead of just a Day. She in labor for half a week! \n\nYour mom is being very self-centered. You definitely need to maintain some strict boundaries for the sale of your wife and now daughter. Any decent person would be excited about their granddaughter being born\u2026 and understanding of being in labor for technically 5 days. Time had no meaning for you those days.", "She's swell \ud83d\ude44", "Thank you. My wife and baby come before anyone in my life", "Congratulations on ur baby being born away from her date lol", "Right. Like I don't even care about my birthday anymore", "Yep my priority is with my girls", "Something is definitely wrong with her. And thank you", "She's very toxic", "Thank you for this. I'm glad I'm starting to see her bad habits more clearly through people like u commenting on my post", "Thank you", "\"steal the spotlight\". Sounds like a narcissist", "Tell her you are going low contact for six months for your own mental health and every time she acts out the time gets increased by six months. If she's actually capable of shaping up, this is the only thing that will do it. She has to lose something, and access to you is the biggest thing you hold that you can withhold.", "Yeah that's what I thought. Keep doing what you're doing , your mom is an adult , she needs to learn you have your own priorities", "Thank you \ud83d\ude02 I was like \u201cma\u2019am, you\u2019ve had the day for over 60 years and you wanna make a kid\u2019s bday all about you? No thank you!\u201d", "Me neither. Crazy that she\u2019s more interested in her birthday than the birth of your child, her grandchild. You\u2019re not a bad son for being there for your family.", "I forgot my dad's birthday once because I was stressed out and it was my first day at my new job. My dad might in fact be a narcassist and didn't even care, I made a bigger deal out of it than he did. \n\nNTA. \n\nI would take a serious time out from your mother. And not a \"few\" weeks. The message needs to sink in and she needs to apologize. And acknowledge she and the flying monkeys were over the line. Your wife has put up with enough.", "Yeah, my sister was born the day before our grandfather's birthday (mom's dad)-- he never favored any grandkid over the others, mind, but it gave them a special 'thing'!", "You know what? No. Mom does not deserve grace and forgiveness. Mom is giving off completely inappropriate sonsband vibes. She tried ruining their wedding. Constantly insults the wife. Interferes with their relationship. Now? This birthday, labor, and baby drama? No, Mom needs a time out, therapy, and to apologize.\n\nMy dude, keep prioritizing your wife and child. And check out grandparents rights and make sure your pediatrician documents how well cared for your child is. Just in case your mother decides to escalate. I saw your post on justnomil... look around there some.", "Lmao I'm glad my baby wasn't born on the day my mom was because it would suck for my kid", "She has put up with enough. This is a new chapter in our lives and I'm starting to believe my mom doesn't need to be part of that", "My daughter was born on Mother\u2019s Day. I like to tell her she was my best Mother\u2019s Day present ever and then watch her roll her eyes.", "Just continue to protect her from your mother", "I\u2019m happy for you and your kid, too!!", "I think you are making the right call. \n\nI'm NC with both of my parents. I get a ping or twinge of sadness every now and then and mourn that I can't have a happy or normal relationship with them. But it was 1000% the right call. I believe you are also making the right call. \n\nNot to be condescending and I know I'm a total stranger, but I'm proud of you for prioritizing the health, safety, and happiness of your wife and child. I think you'll find relief and happiness in this decision as well.", "I know a guy who shares his birthday with his brother, who is two years younger. His older sister's birthday is two days later and the youngest sister's birthday is two days before.", "I used to say that apparently my parents always got horny at the same time of year.", "Nta.. your mother sounds atrocious. You should just go NC until she can pull her head out of her a**. She obviously doesn't remember what childbirth is like. Tell your wife she is a trooper!! I think I would have died if I was on labour for that many days.", "NTA. My mother is a narcissist and this sounds exactly like something she would say\n\nGo into labour on command purely to spite her? Yeah, because your wife felt like spending FOUR DAYS in labour\n\nNarcissists tend to get triggered when they don\u2019t get attention, especially attention they knew they were entitled to (such as birthdays). They also tend to be weird around their daughters/sons-in-law because they seem them as stealing their spotlight \n\nSurely the most important thing right now is that your wife and baby are healthy and happy?", "NTA\n\nYour mother is a piece of work! You\u2019re right to keep her away.\n\nCongratulations on your new addition!", "NTA.  Check out r/JustNoMIL. I think you and your wife will find a lot of great resources and encouragement for managing your mom.  Yikes. Congrats on the wee babe!", "You stick to your wife's side, your momma should not have acted like that. I'd be focused on the fact I'm having a grandbaby & that excitement. I think your mother is rude & very self absorbed!! You just stick to your wife & that beautiful new little life you created!", "op=NTA\n\nForget the flying monkeys.  \n\nThe minute your mother blamed your wife for going into labor DELIBERATELY, she became the A-H and she deserves to be shut out until her fit is over.\n\nIt is good to keep your mother away because if she says this stuff to your healing wife, that is would be so very unacceptable.", "OP you rock. So many husbands in these posts don\u2019t stand up for their wife or their kids and let their mothers run their lives. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that your mother seems like she\u2019s mentally unbalanced. The fact that some of your family members don\u2019t think that she\u2019s being absolutely ridiculous would say that you have a majorly dysfunctional/toxic family. nC is the way to go", "NTA, sorry your family is nutzzz!  Congratulations on your new baby!!", "NTA, my guy. Mom is acting very childish. You were focused on the wife and unborn child. Exactly where your head should have been.", "NTA.  And I have an Aunt that would looooooove a grandaughter.  My cousin Ashley died when she was younger, and my other three male cousins are under 18.  She has two adopted grandbabies and will add more.  Added bonus: she lives on a farm and has animals.", "NTA  Stand your ground, sounds like mom doesn't like not being the center of ALL your attention.  Sounds like jealousy big time, went into labor on purpose?  Seriously, don't listen to anyone, go no contact and enjoy your baby for the next week.\n\nCongratulations!!!", "NTA- I\u2019ve said this on many post concerning in-laws and parents of married children.  They cannot let go!  It was so annoying when my MIL did petty, deliberate things too such any joy we had as a nuclear family.  She ruin many special moments for my husband and I.  Good for you setting boundaries with your mother.  I tell my own three children I have no intention of interfering in your adult lives because I have a life of my own.  You need me, I\u2019m there! That\u2019s it!  You want advice, I\u2019ll give you my own life experience and base my advice on that.", "Your mother is too old for her birthday to matter this much to anyone but her own self", "She was in labor for 5 DAYS and all your mother cares about is you missing her birthday party. What a narcissist! This is going to be a problem with your mother wanting to pull your attention away from your wife and baby. It's time to set up boundaries to follow for the future. After her fit, give her a set of rules. Insulting your wife is one she's not allowed to do. Jealousy is grounds for no contact. She's acting like your mistress instead of your mother. NTA.", "Oh god don't even go there!  LOL  what a nightmare that would be.", "Oh wow. My brother and uncle have shared birthday. My mates bday is day after her sons too. We've all have always treated it as cool coincidences. So sad people get so caught up in sharing bdays nobody can control when they're born. If they could id certainly have avoided being born on a holiday haha", "I don\u2019t know what to say. You get the mother you have. If you love you mother and she loves you figure it out while you still have a mother. Take care of your family 1st of course and congrats on the new baby.", "You don\u2019t know that ladies story. You need to relax. Stop judging before you get judged.", "\ud83e\udd23\n\nIf you think it's acceptable to try and ruin your child's wedding, be shitty to the wife constantly, and then pull these shenanigans then bless your heart. You have clearly never had any toxic family members. Be grateful you have never been through these types of shenanigans. Lol\n\nJust cause it's mom, does not mean she gets a free pass to cause chaos and discord. Not everyone is entitled to forgiveness.", "So, you have 6 siblings raised to worship your mother giving you crap about this? Please tell me you have at least one sibling that's sane. NTA", "Part of her toxicity is that, having not heard from you at a time when she expected to hear from you (her birthday), she never even considered that this might be because something was going on with you. Were you even ok? She didn\u2019t know. Yet she completely took it as a slight to her, and still does.", "I really hate realizing I was an oops valentine's day present :D"]}
