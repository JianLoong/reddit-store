Congratulations on purchasing a home!!!", "NTA- ive lived next to a railway most my life in my parents house. I don't even notice them anymore. So even if you weren't deaf, it wouldn't have to be a deal-breaker. I literally dont notice many tons of steel crossing besides my house anymore. \n\nApparently as a kid I always went to the window and screamed TRAIN whenever a train went by tho.", "NTA. It\u2019s not polite to complain about someone\u2019s house in front of them. They are being jerks. You are not doing anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou're right, they don't have to visit.\n\nI too am thinking jealousy.", "I would ask them what do they expect you to do...NTA, they are just jealous because you are only homeowner in the family.", "It is your house. You earned it and your being deaf allowed you to get a lot of real estate at a lowered price. It's like the stars aligned for you and this house.\n\nOP you are NTA. Enjoy your time in your new house!", "NTA-Rude is not telling them if they don\u2019t like it they can stop coming over. What you suggested is a solution. Rude is actually them coming over and consistently complaining.", "NTA - I suggest adopting the outlook on life when it comes to family who moan about your life that i subscribe to (\"fuck 'em\")  \n\n\nYou found something thats perfect for you in an expensive location, I'm not sure how you can be a better host to the family, maybe next time you talk to them you accuse them of being bad family members and bad hosts when you visit them and moan about how bright everything else and ask them to move house, see how they like it", "NTA. You aren\u2019t a bad host, they\u2019re bad guests.", "You're NTA, but I can definitely understand why they're a little annoyed by it. That being said, the solution is to just not come over, obviously. Idk why theyd keep coming over if it bothers them that much lol", "Yes!   That's what I was going to say.  \nPut up a,sign on the tracks saying \nPetty family visiting please be quiet", "They're rude and bad guests.", "I lived by RR tracks as well when I was younger, horns blaring & the rumble of the train\u2026 great memories- got used to it as well. Story brought a smile to me. Sad family feels like it\u2019s okay to be poor guests.", "Tbh his family is rude but.. his house is literally shaking from it. I have been to houses like this and it is horrible. Its painfully hard and your shit is literally shaking every time a train passes. I think we registered the noise at 70 to 100db which is for sure rough if its a few times per hour.", "I appreciate your support.\n\nBut I wasn't offended by the analogy. It was just their way of trying to equate the annoyance of the noise to someone who has never heard sound.\n\nThanks for speaking up on my behalf but it didn't bother me. It did help me to understand.", "Are you gonna loan OP soundproof material money?", "What's Daredevil?", "I think it is brilliant! Probably one of the few times that being deaf has been an advantage! Enjoy your house,and ignore the jealous crowd.", "I think the difference is that cares about these people. They literally bought a house in their hometown because everyone they know and love is there and they can't imagine living anywhere else. \n\nYour solution to the problem (\"my community complains about how noisy my house is\") is to cut off their community. \n\nSo your solution is for OP to sit alone in their house?\n\nI mean, sure, it's a valid suggestion, if OP enjoys sitting at home alone. I do, sometimes. I like to read or watch my shows. I'm kind of a homebody, so it's pretty easy for me to choose home alone in a social conflict. But then again, I also like to go out with friends on occasion, and to do that, I need friends, so I personally have found it's useful to communicate about disagreements and try to find a solution rather than just cutting people off. The commenter who suggested sound-blocking windows seemed gave what sounded like a good suggestion for preserving relationships.", "I shot wine out my nose. Thanks hahahaha", "Well they did presumably *buy it* from *someone*? \n\nIf housing costs are so exorbitant that no one else in the family has been able to buy a home (and with the way the housing market is going that won\u2019t be improving any time soon) then OP will likely be able to sell it, if/when they even want to. \n\nAnd, like, they got a great deal, and can afford the mortgage, and build their credit + *own.* the home they live in, so regardless of future salability, the current benefits are already major!?", "oh, OP... don't allow your toxic family to move a trailer onto your property...\nThey'll literally try to take it out from under you & because they are all clearly jealous/envious of your status as a legit land & home-owner, I can see them manipulating/gaslighting and even attempting to guilt-trip you into letting them have a piece of your land to themselves ~ I see no good coming out of any of them moving onto your property (especially with the Original comments above mine).", "It\u2019s all in the delivery man. \n\nIt can be that OP cannot solve his family\u2019s problems. There\u2019s a world of difference between \u201chey I am sorry this is bothering you maybe let\u2019s meet somewhere else\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want your complaints anymore, if you don\u2019t like it leave\u201d \n\nFrom the description it\u2019s not a couple of people it\u2019s everyone. So he could try to solve the problem or tell people he doesn\u2019t care and lose relationships.", "I think they're jealous AND if only the house wasn't loud, his parents can move in with him so they wouldn't rent anymore.", "Who", "Daredevil's a marvel character and he's deaf I think", "Why should OP have to pay a hefty price for storm/sound proof windows only to then have to pay out of pocket again to have professionals install them to accommodate toxic family members??? Their family can come over to visit provided they use common sense & proper etiquette as a guest; if they don't like the sound of the trains, perhaps They could just as easily buy noise cancelling headphones and instead of feeling like they're in competition with the trains, oh idk, give their mouths a fkn rest for the time being and Sign instead of talking At OP or raise their voices at one another while they're griping as though OP can't See what they are saying because as they stated, they can definitely read lips...", "Haha been there done that.", "Just here to say congratulations on the house, sounds perfect for you and honestly a genius find! I saw your edit and please ignore these sickos, you are NTA", "I was looking for this comment. I lived near a rail yard for a couple years and after a while, the sounds kinda became weirdly soothing. It was it's own version of \"white noise\", basically. It took me ages after I moved away to be able to sleep well because it was so quiet.", "Would your family ever abandon you because they don\u2019t like your house?", "Bingo! They\u2019re jealous & big mad their pharmacist meal ticket isn\u2019t working out how they\u2019d hoped. They would have run over OP like a freight train if not for his freight train guard dogs. \n\nOP, you made the best move of your life getting that house on that property. Stay there forever if you love it & enjoy your killer guard dogs on rails.", "Daredevil.", "You seem to be trying to pick an argument, despite my having prefaced my entire comment with \"you don't really have to do this if you don't want to\", but a couple of reasons.\n\n1) It will increase the value of the home if OP ever decides to sell\n\n2) If OP will have guests staying from time to time and wants to be nice and accommodating (doesn't have to be the complaining family, maybe friends etc) it will make for a more pleasant stay.", "Blind. And in the Netflix show he'd get an apartment for really low cost because there's a bright neon sign right out the window.", "Well they might not come over if I told them to stop bitching about something that bothered them but doesn\u2019t bother me because I didn\u2019t want to hear it and suggested they not come over.\n\nLook, maybe I got a different read on the situation than literally everyone else, but I stand by that from the information given he handled it poorly. He had an outburst and asked whether it was uncalled for.", "I love this analogy\u2026 all those freight trains unintentionally keeping OP safe from the family of ne\u2019er do wells! Or better yet, *knowingly* providing a buffer between OP\u2019s safe place and the jackals at the door! \n\nOP, truly not trying to bash your family (ok, maybe just a little), but it really does sound like some form of a blessing in disguise, insofar as what you\u2019ve accomplished is spectacular, and anyone who isn\u2019t able to be at least supportive (never mind excited or proud) deserves to be weeded out. From your home at least. \n\nNTA, and if ever came to visit I\u2019d bring a guitar and sing along to the clicketty clacks and rumble bumbles! Just need to learn to play the guitar first (and it\u2019d be another blessing in disguise that you wouldn\u2019t be able to hear me sing haha!) \n\nCongratulations on your huge accomplishment, I hope your family can come around in time (preferably sooner than later), and get on board (choo choooo) supporting you!", "I think you\u2019ll find the bread and butter of the internet is making silly arguments about nothing, out of an effort to feel superior.", "Oh... thanks for correcting. I haven't reached daredevil yet, I am stuck way behind in the Mcu", "This isn\u2019t something simple that\u2019s bothering them. It\u2019s literally the location of their house that\u2019s the problem. No cost effective solution will solve that, so the complaints are completely unwarranted. Even if OP were to soundproof the entire house it\u2019s not going to mask a train. \n\nIf the complaining is as often as OP claims I don\u2019t blame them for what happened. Not the best way to go about it but everyone is different and we don\u2019t know how persistent the family is. I just can\u2019t understand how the family feels entitled to complain in the first place.", "You're right about that!", "Fair point. I also read this very differently, more like an elephant in the room situation. \n\nNot like they were telling him to fix what he couldn\u2019t but more of a how do you not talk about it when it\u2019s constant.\n\nHard to tell from the info given the tone of the complaining."]}
