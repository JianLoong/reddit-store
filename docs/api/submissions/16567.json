This economy is completely outrageous already for buyers (me and my partner looked for a 1 1/2 years recently before saying we'll just keep renting for now) and being able to afford a house in general is a miracle. \n\nSlightly similar situation, I grew up in a house on a main road that was in an air force city. So while I'm not deaf I also am willing to put up with a lot more noise than some people.

You don\u2019t owe it to anyone, family or otherwise, to make it comfortable for them. *It\u2019s not their house*. \n\nAnd I gotta say\u2014especially in considering the kind of garbage push-back you got from some commenters, here\u2014I wonder how much your family\u2019s reactivity is shaped by their own ableism. I don\u2019t mean that they\u2019re doing it in a deliberate or antagonizing way, especially given that you haven\u2019t seen this kind of thing from them, before. But\u2014most of the time, your hearing family members walk around in a world/society that is tailored to them and their needs. They don\u2019t ever have to notice the in-built, universal accommodations that are just handed to hearing people for existing\u2014they certainly don\u2019t have to go out of their way to ask for them, or just\u2014*find ways to function without them*. \n\nIt\u2019s probably a pretty rare situation for them to find themselves in a context that is so well-suited to *your* needs and comfort, and so profoundly ill-suited to theirs. And even without it being a deliberate, self-aware thing\u2014that means they\u2019re probably used to you being flexible, doing more, cultivating extra skills and abilities and workarounds and *patience*\u2014to accommodate them, and hearing people, generally. Instead of that, in this case, you are\u2014totally reasonably\u2014responding with a firm \u201cI\u2019m comfortable right here, and I\u2019m not willing to be made uncomfortable *in my own home*, just because it isn\u2019t an easy, automatic, tailor-made fit for you, like every other place you spend any time in.\u201d\n\nI have a central auditory processing disorder, so am, if anything, SO HEARING, VERY MUCH TOO HEARING\u2014which, if I\u2019m being honest, leaves me with absolutely zero sympathy for your family, on this one. I *know* that it\u2019s possible to cope with overstimulating noise. You just\u2026 buy a good pair of earplugs. They make a brand that looks like a rather daring piercing, filters out excess noise, still lets you hear people talking to you from close by, and fits in a little case you can attach to your key-ring. Or you invest in a good pair of noise-canceling headphones\u2014not cheap, but very much the price I pay if I want to live around the rest of humanity, ever be able to process and understand speech, and NOT murder anyone over their breathing and chewing and mumbling to themselves, and horrible loud cars and motorcycles and air conditioning fans and overhead lights and footsteps and sometimes, I swear to you, the tiny little ticking noises of an especially large horsefly walking around, out of reach. \n\nYour family can take some initiative and do those exact things, if the noise in your house is truly intolerable to them. Or they can do the other thing that I\u2019m confident we both do, albeit in somewhat different auditory directions, and *suck it up*. You get to spend your whole life in spaces designed for hearing people. Maybe they could dedicate a little less energy to passive-aggressive efforts to get you to make this more comfortable for them\u2014and a little more, to appreciating how much of your life you spend doing this exact thing, on their behalf.\n\nI am confident, even on the sole basis of the four words \u201cI can read lips,\u201d that you have accommodated your family, over the years, considerably farther than they\u2019d need to reach to be able to manage the noise in your house. Expecting them to do that\u2014or go spend their time elsewhere, if they refuse\u2014is not being rude or demanding, or somehow obtuse in ways that require patronizing explanation of how HARD it is to hear LOUD SOUNDS. It\u2019s a reasonable and appropriate request for them to engage you in a way that just partially, a little bit, while they are visiting you in your home\u2014requires them to reciprocate the effort on your behalf that you are *ceaselessly* making on theirs.", "You\u2019re the perfect person for the house?

I live in a neighborhood where I say hello to people over my fence, I wave to people as they drive by, and my friend can\u2019t stand it. \n\nWhen my friend visits she only talks about how she could never live here, in her mind it\u2019s the worst. She made a fake gagging sound when she referred to all the houses around my house. It\u2019s gotten so bad that I have wondered whether I should tell her that if she doesn\u2019t like my choice of home then she doesn\u2019t have to come over anymore.

What is so wrong about OP calling out people harassing them with derogatory comments about a disability they have no control over?

It didn\u2019t even bother my while watching TV, reading, sleeping, etc. And yet, without fail, every single time one of my friends came over, they had to complain about it. Like they felt compelled to remind me there was a 50-ton honking train 10m away from my bedroom window. Didn\u2019t really bother me, but for some reason, it seems that people can\u2019t just be polite and keep it to themselves.

OP always thought they were better than family /s\n\nThe should be happy for OP instead of looking for him to be their retirement plan", "> I'd stop having them over and not even look at them.\n\nThat was the solution. Two parts. Stop having them over (part 1) and not even look at them (part 2). \n\nSince OP states in the original post that they stopped hosting events when their friends/ family began complaining, but is frustrated they continue to complain at other events where OP is not the host, I assumed the solution of \"Don't look at them\" -- to a deaf person, which is tantamount to \"Don't interact with them at all\" was offered because OP  had already tried the extremely obvious solution of no longer hosting guests. \n\nBecause the friends and family complain even though they are no longer attending events hosted by OP, it appears OP's friends and family could be:\n1. Jealous of OP's ability to own a home (most ungenerous reading of circumstances).\n2. Upset that OP bought a home in a location not conducive to long- term hearing guests, as it is not uncommon for family to stay with one another when down on their luck ... but OP's new property situation makes that option unlikely, whereas when OP was a renter they were potentially available to host family/ friends in need (a still selfish, but slightly less selfish interpretation of events).\n3. Frustrated since OP became a homeowner, they are no longer in the \"host\" rotation, but are now perpetually a guest (most generous reading).\n\nOP can't know which, if any of these (or something else entirely) is causing the complaint without having a conversation that goes something like, \"You know I can see you complaining about my house again, right? We're not even there, and you haven't come to visit since I moved in! I come to you guys! Why does it bother you that I live around trains? Are you afraid it will damage my hearing?\"\n\nFamily member: \"I hate the noise!\"\n\nOP: \"Okay, and you don't live there or visit -- so what's the real problem? Why do you keep complaining about it?\n\nOP should force a conversation. Without stating the problem, they can't brainstorm possible solutions. Right now OP is assuming the noise is the problem, but I suspect the noise is exacerbating a change in dynamic since OP moved. Maybe OP used to host more, or used to watch someone's pet or kids, and now the social dynamic has changed along with the house.\n\nFINALLY, their physical discomfort is valid. At no point does OP suggest it is not. OP acknowledges the trains are loud and frequent and it would be uncomfortable for a hearing person. This is why OP got the property at a steal.\n\nSomeone else offered some alternative suggestions to sound proof windows, such as sound proof headphones. I think that's a great idea! If OP kept a basket of sound proof headphones for guests, that might help a lot. \n\nThe cost of professional sound proof window installation is property investment that OP would have to decide the value of on their own, and it could increase their property value. If they want to host events and have family stay with them in the future, it may be a cost they're willing to take on. Or they can ignore the advice. \n\nAll I was trying to say was that a \"solution\" where OP stops interacting with his family/ friends completely didn't sound like what OP was looking for.", "That comment isn\u2019t implying OP is stupid. But whatever makes you feel good.", "That\u2019s how I read it too. They want OP to find a quieter place so they can be moochers.

In my case, I lived close to a military base with an airstrip, so we had helicopter, plane, and jet noise quite frequently. \n\nMy family is an Air Force family and there's a lot of excitement about aircraft, so for us, the noise was just a reminder that we could step out on the lanai and see something cool.\n\nAs far as your family goes, I think about the rule of etiquette about not highlighting something that can't be resolved in five minutes. It's meant to apply to appearances, but you can open it up a bit.\n\nIf someone has spinach in their teeth, you tell them so they can go fix it and save a little embarrassment.

I get the sense that this is a crabs-in-a-bucket situation: your investment in a home is not something they have experience with, so they want to downplay it to manage their own feelings.

You may know something, but being in survival mode to get out of the situation makes us develop coping skills that might not be conducive for the strong future we are building for ourselves. \n\nJust the other day I learned the guilt I always feel when I have to reenforce a boundary is actually anger that I feel towards myself for not being able to \u2018fix the problem\u2019 when there isn\u2019t a problem to fix, just adults who are upset that they aren\u2019t able to control someone they were able to when the person was a child. \n\nAnywho, I wish you the best in your future endeavors too!\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar", "Thanks!  Been in and out of therapy for\u2026lessee\u2026carry, the 2\u202632 years!  For depression and codependency and anxiety and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other stuff.  Mind, I never connected the golden child thing to any of these, so than you for making that connection for me!  I mean, all the family has passed away now, so no current stressors, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s still tons of damage from before.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not a bad host - you are just not a host, and you don't need to be. You have a house that is both affordable and comfortable for you and you live in it - you don't force anyone else to live there or visit, and you don't owe anyone a place where they feel comfortable visiting. No, you were not wrong to say they don't have to come over. I'd carry in further - you can tell the complainers that they don't have to come over, but you refuse to discuss your living situation, and if they persist that will be the end of every conversation. And if they accuse you of anything -  being a bad host, being rude, whatever - cut the conversation short. They don't get to tell you who you are.", "NTA\u2026\n\nI have some sensory issues, so \u201csharp\u201d sounds would trigger a migraine, like the train brakes squealing or the horn. \n\nYou know what I wouldn\u2019t do? Go to the house. I\u2019m sure OP would perfectly understand if I said I would love to see them but didn\u2019t want to chance a migraine and suggest some other locale. I would go if OP asked for a big occasion like a housewarming party and just suck it up.\n\nETA, congrats on the house!", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't buy your house for your family. You bought it for you. They are acting like brats. If it's too noisy for them, they can invite you to their place instead.\n\nMy first apartment with my husband was right next to the railroad tracks. After awhile you get used to the noise.", "NTA. While not deaf I also have a train that runs maybe 100-150 ft from my front door, multiple times a day. Been living here so long that it\u2019s such a common noise that it doesn\u2019t even register anymore. Heck, it\u2019d probably be more off-putting to go a day without hearing the train at this point.\n\nYour family sounds jealous of your successes and upset that they cannot find as much peace in your home as you do, which is a good thing, it means none of them should try to move in on you.\n\nCongrats on your home and accomplishments and enjoy your space!!", "NTA.\n\nThey are jealous because you own your own house now. That this property was affordable to you because people who can hear don't want to buy it and the noise doesn't bother you because you're deaf is brilliant... (I'd like to call it compensatory justice because the one thing that disables you in other areas has now indeed enabled you to have your own property). Your family should be happy for you.\n\nEnjoy your very own first house... and if they don't like it they can indeed just stop coming around. You don't need to be a good host to terrible guests, it always goes both ways.", "I definitely am getting a crab bucket feel to the whole thing.  They don't like that OP is rising above their social economic level.", "Sounds like the house is a perfect match for you and a steal to boot! You'll never be bothered by the noise but you'll get to enjoy a beautiful house with actual property. Great deal! I think the family can get used to it or be polite enough not to complain for the small time they're visiting you. It's not like they're being forced to live there.", "My grandparents lived next to a train depot and the noise to someone not used to it was annoying to the point of becoming an obsession (my grandparents were so used to it they didn't even notice it). That's probably what happened, to the point that the only thing they can think about is the noise in your house. And if you feel the vibration it could be that they can't have a normal conversation because the noise is too loud. To follow your brother's analogy, it would be like trying to read with a strong white-blue light flashing regularly in your eyes. After a time it becomes physically painful. Noise can do the same. \n\nThere's no answer to your problem. This is a place that is perfect for you but not for them. And let me warn you that no hearing person will enjoy being in a place as noisy as you describe it so they will never like it. \n\nSo, NTA for snapping back after so many complaints, it is like the water torture. Drip, drip, drip... And if you like and are proud of your house that is not going down well. \n\nBut you should also tell your family that you are sorry for snapping back like that. That you realise that the noise is a real problem for them and as the house is perfect for you what kind of solution other than you moving can they give. You visiting them, or one of them hosting family meetings, could be the solution. However, they should also stop complaining about your house. You know they don't like it, they don't have to repeat it every single time they see you.", "The fear is probably irrational, I have anxiety as I said. But I have friends who were killed in their car on train tracks back in high school because the gate and lights weren\u2019t working. So it\u2019s not like it never happens. I feel like when the tracks are by your home and you cross them multiple times per day it might be easy to get complacent because it becomes routine, and trains are fast.", "People like this just TAKE from the younger ones. It\u2019s disgusting and I wish OP all the riches in life. Her family can kick rocks.", "Reminds me of the Netflix Daredevil show, where he got his apartment for a steal because nobody else wanted a neon billboard right outside their window.\n\nNo problem for the blind guy.", "Oh yes, 100% agree- sorry if the sarcasm wasn\u2019t clear!!", "Don't even joke lol. \nMy mother in law found out that we have hellodfresh deliveries.  Then falsely accused me of only being with my wife for money (she only makes a tiny bit more than me) and making her buy the boxes for me (I solely pay for them)\nThen went on a rant about how the boxes were causing us to be behind on our mortgage (never missed a payment or even been late) and now we need to sell our house that we've only owned for a year because obviously we're not good at money management"]}
