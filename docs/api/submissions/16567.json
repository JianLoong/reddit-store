Congratulations on finding a home so well suited to your needs!", "NTA. You're not being a bad host, they're being bad guests. There are only so many remedies that you can offer beyond ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones. They are free to stay in a hotel. \n\nCongrats on the home!", "NTA.  This poor man is deaf and somehow his family is so ungrateful, they've made him tired of hearing.", "NTA and congratulations!!!\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a", "NTA \"being a bad host\" like what? wtf do they want you to do? derail the trains?\n\nif i were you i would get a bunch of those cheapo earplugs and next time they complain hand them a pair", "I used to live next to a RAAF base with F111s and other aircraft taking off at all hours of the day and night and the smell of avfuel constantly in the air. You get used to it. \nNTA congrats on your home.", "NTA. Your family are being incredibly rude by constantly harping on about it so you're fully justified telling them they don't have to visit. Congratulations on your house purchase btw", "YNtA You just buried the lead.", "NTA. There's this amazing little boutique hotel that I love and have stayed at three times. It's right next to a train station and they blow their horns at all hours and despite that, I still stay, because it's charming and historical and super fun. If I had a light shining in my eyes while I was trying to sleep I wouldn't go back. It's not the same. Yeah it's not ideal but it's tolerable for a brief visit.", "It's absurdly rude and distasteful to come into someone elses house and say anything bad about it - let alone constantly criticize it. And OP is deaf - he doesn't care about the noise so neither should they. It sounds like THEY're jealous assholes.", "You're not getting the gist? The ONLY considerate thing OP can do to please the family is for OP to sell the house and live in rentals like all of them.  /s\n\nThey're just bitter that OP got it for cheap (like Matt Murdock in Daredevil).\n\nOP, please do inform them that you understand that you are hurting them by inviting them to your house to be exposed to the noise all the time, and that you'll never invite them again so they won't be exposed to the horrible sounds.\n\nAnd enjoy your house. Congrats\n\nETA: /s", "I'd stop having them over and not even look at them.", "I\u2019d be inclined to start telling them on visits to their place all sorts of complaints. \n\n\u201cOMG, it\u2019s smells here, how can you stand it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess this is *nice*. For a *rental*.\n\nEdited a word", "\u201cSounds\u201d \ud83e\udd28", "yeah, really!? NTA. And as soon as OP got to mentioning they were deaf I got a HUGE smile. Way to grab an opportunity!", "Just wait...eventually someone will approach OP about putting a small house or trailer on the 'terrible ' property.", "Nta I think they are jealous and taking it out on you", "Honestly, I have lived near train tracks and what OP is describing sounds like they are near a railyard and honestly its not just the sound of the train rolling past or the shaking, it's constant horns and screeching of brakes too. I have a feeling that OP doesn't realize just how painfully awful their home is to someone who can hear. However there is nothing keeping OP from visiting family at their apartments instead.", "\u201cI suppose I must buy everyone high quality noise cancelling headphones now, because clearly that\u2019s my job\u201d.", "They do visit but most of the time I spend with them is elsewhere, like their own places for example.", "I agree. I have both close to a highway and train tracks and the highway traffic noise was a much harder adjustment.", "You guys pedaled the whole way? I'm in absolute awe. Truly amazing to me! I wish I had the stamina for something like that!", "I don't only see them at my house. Most of the time I spend with them is at their own places, or elsewhere in public. I don't only host them for visits, most of the time it is the other way around.", "Yes all the time.", "We often have visits at their place or in public places like restaurants for example. It's not like I only see them if they come to my house and refuse to otherwise. Most of the time we are together or visiting is not at my house.", "Yes all of them do. Why wouldn't they know it?", "oooo i never considered jealousy. if i was the family i would look at it as a steal. she\u2019s lives near the train tracks, but the noise doesn\u2019t bother her cause she\u2019s deaf & so she got the house at an AMAZING deal! would be doing more congratulating then hating\u2026 but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "please tell me you\u2019re being sarcastic", "This. I just don\u2019t go out of my way to see people that annoy me.\n\nOP congrats on the house!", "\u201cI suppose I must buy everyone high quality noise cancelling headphones now, because clearly that\u2019s my job\u201d.", "Oh God don't I know it!\n\nI have a second building that is more or less not suitable for living until I can get better from some medical issues and get some money into it.\n\nStill have people offering to move in. Like I would risk my legal sanity by renting out an inhabitatable house.", "I often visit them at their places, or we get together st restaurants or other public venues. The majority of time I spend with any of them is not at my own house.", "But the point is, it's THEIR home. It suits them. It's rude of the guests to complain so much when invited into their home. They didn't have to come, but they do and then make OP feel bad about where they live.", "I lievd near a train station/tracks for years.  \nYou actually get used to the sound of it.", "For real though, if the family signs (which I hope they do since they have a deal family member), them bringing noise cancelling headphones and hanging out together without the annoyance of the trains could be a great solution! NTA", "Full disclosure: we went from Santa Cruz, CA to Boston, MA by way of TX and FL.  Got rides over mountain ranges (coastal range, Sierra-Nevadas and Rockies) and also took some other forms of transportation (train, bus) to get ahead of winter; out of 6000 miles we pedaled about 3000.  Once we got to New Orleans we stayed on the coasts and on bikes; only took a 24 hour sailboat ride from SC to NC for the novelty.  A once-in-a-lifetime experience.", "She does seem to have a lot of whining guests, it seems like a solid passive aggressive move", "You can't control them, only yourself. Since they aren't stopping complaining,  either ignore it or don't have them over. I don't think you're wrong for saying what you did, but I don't blame them for being uncomfortable.", "Forgot I was commenting on AITA, will include the tag. Thanks for pointing it out.", "phew \ud83d\ude05 for a second i thought you were serious", "Don't get me wrong, sometimes some people here ARE serious about it. That's why I was thankful when you pointed it out.", "[removed]", "NTA, the house is good for you, they dont live there and can suck it up for a few hours."]}
