But I found something I could afford and jumped at the chance. \n\nMy house is on four acres and ~~wasin~~ was in good shape. The catch is that it is against two separate railway lines. They both run right along the property. There are also railway crossings beside my house and nearby my house. All but one are open level crossings (no lights or barriers). Trains sound their horns because of these crossings and both lines by my property are frequently used at all hours. \n\nI don't care about the noise from the trains or their horns because I'm Deaf (since birth). I can feel the vibrations of course but that doesn't bother me. I got my house for a much lower price because of the tracks running right beside my property and all the noise. If I wasn't Deaf I would probably not want to live here. But it's perfect for me and allowed me to actually afford a house.\n\nNo one else in my family is Deaf.

I wouldn't care if it was the odd comment here or there but it's not that. It's constant and comes up all the time even when they aren't visiting. It's all of them (grandparents on both sides, great aunt, my parents and my siblings) and like I said it is constant. I've lived here for almost a year now and it's still going on. My family has never been like this about anything before and we've always gotten along.\n\nI finally said that if they don't like coming to my house they don't have to come here anymore. That just got me accused of being rude and a bad host. I am just tired of always hearing how terrible it is at my house and how no one likes it there. Was I wrong to say what I said?

Good for you! They can kick rocks down the railway.", ">That just got me accused of being rude and a bad host.\n\nOh really? And how do they suggest you be a GOOD host? Should you be shutting off the trains when they come by?\n\nWhat a ridiculous display of nonsense from people imposing on your hospitality without an equivalent home to offer. NTA", "NTA: OP, you are tired of their complaints. To me it sounds like \"sour grapes\"; they cannot afford to buy a home, so they can feel justified in their situation by disparaging yours. Your home sounds like a wonderful investment. Hopefully they will get accustomed to the sounds. I was raised near the train tracks, so the sound of trains rolling by is soothing & nostalgic for me. Best wishes in your new home!", "NTA. It sounds like they all just want to rain on your parade. Did they expect you to buy a house to cater to them?? Don't let them squash your happiness\u2014It sounds like they're being overly critical because none of them can afford to buy their own house and are jealous.", "NTA. What are you supposed to do? \"Oh sorry, as your host I will stop those trains right away!\" Come on.", "NTA. They are being incredibly rude. congratulations on buying a house that works for you!!!", "NTA. If my family had a problem with my place of living, I\u2019d tell them the same, that they can buy me a different house if they wanted, or they can wear noise cancelling headphones while they visit.", "NTA- so , like,\u2026.. are you supposed to move to a whole different house  because it would be more convenient for them?\n\nLmao.\n\nNo", "NTA. Do they visit often? They can't just deal for a few hours here and there?", "NTA.  If they don't like it, they can stay home.", " NTA I\u2019m not completely deaf, but I\u2019m sitting here thinking that it doesn\u2019t seem too bad to me. I used to live nearby rail lines that were down the hill from where we lived. Hearing the train whistles wasn\u2019t too bad, as far as I was concerned. It was just part of the scenery. Your family is rude.", "NTA \n\nTheir constant complaining smacks of jealousy.  I used to live by a railway track, it was only about 40 feet from my back garden, and after a while I didn't even notice. If your family have been coming around for a year and are still complaining, then it's not the noise or the vibrations, since they should be used to it by now. It's not like you're forcing them to visit you, so they can stay away from now on and leave you in peace. \n\nThe reason they got so huffy when you told them not to visit if they don't like it, is because they're jealous that you're the first person in the family to own their own home. They should be proud of you, but I guess they're all just too prideful or spiteful for that, so they elect to try and tear you down instead. Ignore their petty nonsense and enjoy your home.", "NTA.  You are absolutely right, if they don't like it then don't come there.", "NTA. Good for you for setting boundaries.", "NTA - you said it yourself, don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t come. They aren\u2019t the ones living there, so it\u2019s not their problem. They could be jealous that you managed to buy a house and didn\u2019t have to rent, and take out that annoyance by complaining about the trains.", "NTA: Sounds like you handled it pretty well given there were much more snarky things you could have said... like \"I don't hear the trains here, and I don't have to listen you either\" and just turn your back on them.\n\nWhat they NEED to hear is 'I'm sorry you feel that way about my house.  I love it here, and if you can't come without complaining about the noise, then you're not welcome here.\n\nIt's the TRUTH... but telling them that is just going to get them pissed off more.", "NTA. They already mentioned it and you\u2019re tired of hearing it. You were in the right.", "What exactly do they expect you to do about trains? NTA\n\nMaybe get some noise canceling headphones for guests?", "NTA, it honestly sounds like they're pressuring you to move. But it's perfect for you and you are the one who lives there. \n\nI would honestly propose that you visit their home instead, or you visit in a public place, like a cafe or a picnic in a park.", "NTA, I would have said the same thing.", "NTA, the house is good for you, they dont live there and can suck it up for a few hours.", "My wife and I once crossed the continent by bicycle and often camped right next to railroad tracks.  The first few times a freight train barreled through in the middle of the night it woke us up and startled us, but then we got used to them and slept through them, even finding them oddly soothing.  I still love the sounds of trains at night.  NTA", "NTA", "NTA. You found a place you can afford and that you like. That's what matters.  I don't think you were wrong: you've heard them and you aren't going to change your mind on your home because they hear the trains. Enjoy your home!", "NTA. I am not deaf and lived adjacent to a railroad crossing for a few years. It is not that big of a deal-and hardly any of my guests even commented on it, none ever got upset about it. Also, unless you live somewhere that has higher than average train traffic, it's not as if it is a constant noise like vehicle traffic. A train is only passing here and there, not constantly. It sounds like they spend more time complaining about the noise than actually hearing it.\n\nYou're not a bad host, they are poor guests. You have already purchased this property and clearly have no intention of moving. You can't change the trains going by, but they can certainly change their attitude about them and enjoy the time they spend with you by ignoring a minor, temporary irritation (and shut up about it).", "Nta I think they are jealous and taking it out on you", "NTA. You are not a bad host. They are bad guests.", "NTA.\n\nYour house is my oldest brother's dream house. And he's not Deaf.", "NTA. I find train sounds comforting and would much prefer listening to that than complaining family LOL. When I was young we lived directly next to the tracks. Most everybody did back in the days in the US when rail was everything. Not only do you get used to it but you come to rely on it and wait for the sounds. We taught our children to listen for the \"night-night train\" a 10:00 p.m. run. I miss trains and I think you made an excellent decision especially based on your situation.  Just wish you could enjoy the sounds as we have.", "Incredible. High five. You were describing the set up and I was like \"oh boy, yep that's too much for me\" - and then you said you were Deaf. NTA regardless.\n\nThat's awesome. There's a railway line at the end of our street, and I quite like just the sound of the train itself occasionally - it seems like the vibration could even be kind of nice?\n\nAnyway, it doesn't bother you, you get a sweet house, the house is actually useful to someone.
