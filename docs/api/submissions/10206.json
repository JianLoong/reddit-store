Well to the story. \n\nI went to work for the first time since I came back from Dubai and I used the parfume. I was most of the day alone in my office but when I came to the common room one of my coworkers told me \"wow, you are wearing some new parfume... its really strong.\" and left the room. I didnt think anythink of it until later in the day when I came back, sat next to her and in few moments her eyes got all watery and she started to sniff. She left the room again and havent returned. Later she wrote me an email if I could stop wearing the parfume because it s causing her some allergic reaction or something like that and that it s just too strong. \n\nI texted her that I am sorry but I couldnt, it was a gift from my sister and I really love it. I told her I could try to wear a little bit less of it so it does not smell so heavy for her. Since then she refused to be in the same room with me and she is venting the common room everytime I leave it.

In all my years working, I have had to go home MANY times because someone in the office is wearing perfume. My migraines from perfume cause INTENSE pain, any sounds and even light make it even more painful (I have to sit in the dark WITH sunglasses on so as to avoid my migraine from getting worse, and I am throwing up all day long, until the migraine goes away, which can take hours, or even days. There is something INSIDE the perfume, other than the actual scent, that triggers my migraines, although some people even just the scent can trigger one, or they could have allergies to ANY fragrance. I used to be married to someone from Turkey, and he would use middle eastern colognes and \"perfumes\" and honestly they DEFINITELY trigger my migraines. In my experience middle eastern perfumes have more, and stronger, of whatever that trigger is, than perfumes I encounter for sale in the US. Only about 80% of US perfumes give me migraines. \nSo I was the AH in the office, that would have to go to HR and ask if they can enforce, or implement a ban on perfumes in the office, because they physically make me ill and put me in great pain.

(Maybe it\u2019s a cultural difference, but that\u2019s one of the most basic expectations of personal hygiene where I\u2019m from.)

It is also possible you do not have as fine a sense of smell as your coworker. All the same, your coworker has an allergy to your perfume and you should discontinue use.\n\nIn a professional setting, perfume is fine, but it needs to be close to your body, so someone would only be able to smell it very close to you. Generally, the rule is -- if someone can smell you further away than what could be whispered close in your ear, it is too strong and you need to dial it back or not wear that to work. That your coworkers commented on your perfume in a common space means it is too strong!\n\nIf you really love it so much, try spraying it indirectly on an undergarment like your bra, or very lightly spray, say, a hair tie.
