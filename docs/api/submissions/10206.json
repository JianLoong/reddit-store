I was most of the day alone in my office but when I came to the common room one of my coworkers told me \"wow, you are wearing some new parfume... its really strong.\" and left the room. I didnt think anythink of it until later in the day when I came back, sat next to her and in few moments her eyes got all watery and she started to sniff. She left the room again and havent returned. Later she wrote me an email if I could stop wearing the parfume because it s causing her some allergic reaction or something like that and that it s just too strong. \n\nI texted her that I am sorry but I couldnt, it was a gift from my sister and I really love it. I told her I could try to wear a little bit less of it so it does not smell so heavy for her.

Your co-worker had a physical, allergic reaction to your perfume, has to vent a room after you\u2019ve been in it just so she can use the room, and you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re TA for refusing to stop wearing the perfume at work. She was considerate enough to explain the issue to you and ask you to stop wearing the perfume to work. I hope she now takes it to HR because you\u2019re making her working conditions intolerable. And, yes, you\u2019re definitely TA.", "YTA. Wearing a strong perfume IS being a smelly person.", "YTA\u2014Why are your only 2 options to be \u201csmelly\u201d or wear a ridiculous amount of perfume? BTW, perfume doesn\u2019t cover up body odor. It just makes the body odor even worse. \n\nA very good friend of mine is allergic to scents. Your choice could easily land her in the hospital. She knows that she can\u2019t control what others do, but she would have to physically avoid you from now on (since you\u2019re refusing to not use the perfume in the workplace) and let HR and her immediate superiors about it.", "YTA. If its seriously affecting her and causing an allergy then don't wear it to work. My Co worker has asthma so is extremely sensitive to some perfumes and sprays so if we are working with him we don't wear such heavy fragrances.

You may not smell it, but everyone else can.   \n\n\nThat said, some people have severe allergies to scents, and it sounds like your coworker is one of them. If you keep wearing the scent after seeing her reaction, YTA.", "YTA, I\u2019ve worked in places where you\u2019re not allowed to wear perfume for this very reason.

You absolutely must wear this gifted perfume even though it is literally causing reactions in your coworkers? Be considerate. Take a shower instead.", "YTA and I can't stand inconsiderate people like you, that wear unbearably strong perfume, and expect everyone else to accept it. It's no different than cigarette smoke. Get over yourself. BTW deodorant stops body odor.", "YTA wear another smell. This isn\u2019t her not liking it, this is an allergy that you should be willing to accommodate", "YTA. You can save the perfume for weekends or days off or special occasions. Heck, wear it to bed! You wanting to smell nice doesn\u2019t supersede your coworker\u2019s need to breathe without an allergic reaction. \n\nA lot of people have scent sensitivities (heh\u2026scentsitivities\u2026), so using a lighter or no perfume would be wiser, especially before HR gets involved and creates a scent-free workplace rule.", "YTA - you shouldn\u2019t be able to smell another person unless you\u2019re closer than is appropriate in the workplace", "YTA - perfume isn't supposed to cover body odor, this isn't the 1600s before readily available showers. If you have an office you have everything you need to perform proper hygiene and not have an odor.", "theres a difference between someone saying oh thats a little strong or fully have a reaction like your coworker is. you dont have to wear it everyday your excuse that you cant stop wearing it because your sister bought it for you is ridiculous, you dont have to wear it EVERYDAY! get over yourself shower properly and stop being such an AH! YTA!!!", "YTA\n\nYou'd rather watch her suffer from her allergic reactions than see her comfortable in the space you share. Wow.", "A person wearing a strong perfume is a smelly person. If you have a body odour problem, adding perfume just makes it worse. YTA.", "YES you're the AH. There is a reason why workplaces have a no scent rule. \n1. Not everyone likes perfume and forcing them to smell you all day is extremely disrespectful. If it's very strong your coworkers may not be able to work. \n2. Perfume has a reputation for being used to mask body odor giving the impression that the user is unclean and unwashed. (On that note, if you don't bathe or smoke perfume does not mask this.. it just adds to the stink.)\n3. Ingredients in perfume have given my coworkers terrible migraines that have resulted in them missing work.\n4. I personally have an allergy to an ingredient in perfume that causes me to sneeze uncontrollably until I remove myself. I have to leave the office as I cannot work. \n5. My coworker was sent to the Emergency Room after perfume cause a major asthma attack. This major medical episode resulted in her early retirement.\n\nFor the 5 reasons above, wearing perfume in a shared space is incredibly disrespectful to your coworkers and can be incredibly harmful and potentially fatal to your coworkers. \n\nYou need to understand that the chemicals in perfume can be incredibly harmful. The answer is quite simple. Don't wear perfume to work. \n\nOn a personal note - I seriously hate people who wear too much perfume. My first instinct is to get as far away from them as possible, even if I'm not sneezing. I shouldn't be able to smell you outside of being up and close within your personal space - like cm's from you. If you're giving off chem trails you're achieving the exact opposite goal - you're turning people away rather than bringing them in. You're essentially dousing yourself in human repellent. Just stop.", "**YTA** you know it\u2019s making her sick and you\u2019re too selfish to care? That makes you an AH. You can easily wear the *perfume* when you get home from work. You can easily wear it when going to the store, movies, dinner with family, a walk in the park, over your pj\u2019s when you first wake up in the morning. You can wear it anywhere and everything *but work* just so you can be a *decent human being* for your coworker. I\u2019d be venting to other coworkers myself if someone was intentionally making me sick with their perfume *and refusing to stop using it at work* when they **know** it makes me sick. And if you have an issue with smelling bad they make extra strength medical grade deodorant over the counter at Walmart. Also, showering daily helps a *ton*.", "YTA - you co-worker is having a physical reaction to your perfume - watery eyes, sniffing and probably a headache and maybe even nausea.  It's not that she doesn't like it, it's that she needs to be able to breathe!\n\nThe fact is that you ARE a smelly person - strong perfume and strong BO are equally offensive.\n\nSave the perfume for your off hours.", "YTA I have some coworkers like that and if they spend some time in the vicinity of my desk I have to leave the area so I don\u2019t get a headache.", "YTA", "YTA - and what's more you may be in violation of workplace safety policies which typically prohibit strong scents, as there are those who may have respiratory sensitivity to it.\n\nDo you not understand that quite apart from being simply rude to wear strong scents in an office envirnoment, you may actually be exposing coworkers to severe health effects?\n\nIt is possible for a strong scent to, e.g. trigger an asthma attack or allergic reaction up to and including anaphylaxis.\n\nPerfume *makes* you a \"smelly person.\" And furthermore, if you have concerns about body odor, **perfume does NOT cover it up, it just adds to it** (something they literally teach 11-year-olds in health classes in most places).

I hate people who think they are gifting us with the power of their manufactured scent. 1. Take a shower 2. Use antiperspirant 3.

Not the workplace.", "YTA. \n\nYou are choosing to be an Ohio train wreck to the detriment of others. \n\nVery selfish of you.", "YTA \n\nWearing a perfume to work that you know a colleague is allergic too is irresponsible as well making you an AH.

Please...

Depending on what this woman is allergic to, you could *literally* kill her.\n\nAnd even if she never reacts like that, you can visibly see that you are causing her actual physical discomfort. And you \"can't\" stop wearing it? There are plenty of other places and times you can wear your perfume. \n\nSo you'd rather smell nice than smell bad.

It\u2019s not all that hard to be courteous!", "Right? Not only that, but with strong perfumes, they tend to linger.
