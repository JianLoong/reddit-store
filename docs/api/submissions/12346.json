{"id": 12346, "submission_id": "11rnl3x", "title": "AITA for leaving my CLEAN menstrual cup by the kitchen sink?", "selftext": "AITA for leaving my menstrual cup by the sink.\n\nI(25F) live in a basement suite with my cousin(30M). We have our own, separate rooms, but we share the kitchen, bathroom and living space. We first started to have fights about the way I threw away my period pads. Usually I wouldn't roll them up and just throw them into the shared garbage by the toilet, trying to face the blood side downwards, but according to my roommate, the pads would often end up with the bloody side up. We had a huge fight about it and he asked me to buy a separate garbage can for anything of mine (period or non period related.) I refused to buy the garbage can, so he paid for it, and since we had an agreement that I would be doing all the house dishes and he would be taking care of all the garbages, I figured he would take out my \"special\" garbage can too... He did not.\n\nI wanted to stop fighting about this, so I eventually switched from using pads to using a menstrual cup. I figured that a menstrual cup will get rid of any period byproducts or garbage, so the issue would be effectively solved, right?\n\nNo. Now we are fighting about my menstrual cup.\n\nNow, EVERY time I take the cup out (1-2 times a day,) I wash it with soap TWICE, spending about 1-2 min just lathering it up with soap, making sure to clean the inside, the outside, the tail and the suction holes before I re-insert it. I do this regardless of if I need to reinsert it right after or not, it's so clean that I can put the cup in my mouth and I taste nothing but plastic. BUT, I still need to boil the cup to 100% complete the cleanse.\n\nSince I do have a tendency to procrastinate, I would usually leave the CLEAN cup by the kitchen sink, as seeing it would remind me that I still have to boil it. But, since anything that has been inside my vagina is apparently 'disgusting', I start seeing a drinking mug being placed over my menstrual cup. Not too bad of a solution, but I mean, now I don't see the cup, so I forget about needing to boil it. So this devolves into my roommate hiding the menstrual cup under a drinking mug and me removing it every time we walk by the sink. I even put a note, asking him to stop putting mugs over the cup, but he just ignores the note and hides it anyway.\n\nNow, this part I know I did not act in the most civil way possible, but I was so angry that I took out all of my dildos and placed them all over the kitchen. Each dildo is clean, but there's one by the sink, one in the dish drying rack and I fitted the  menstrual cup over the faucet lever.\n\nI know that last part wasn't the best, but I am just so tired of having to hide the fact that I am a woman and have periods. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I have been reading all the comments for the past 6 hours or so and yes, I see what everyone is saying. Whilst there seems to be a misunderstanding in that I did not clean my cup 100% (which I did), I simply did not sanitize it yet. And for those thinking that I cleaned my cup in the kitchen sink - no, I did so in the bathroom and then moved the cup to the kitchen in preparation to boil it. Once boiled, my cup is hidden from view in the bathroom counter.\n\nI heard you, I am the asshole. I get it, it's disgusting and mostly - it shows no class. Eitherway, I have replied to some comments, left some of the others, but at this point I'm low key stressing out and getting a headache, so I'm gonna refrain from reading any more comments.\n\nTo those concerned: yes, I apologized to my roommate. Yes, I removed all my sexy toys and my cup from the kitchen. And my resolution is to keep my cup in my room, as that is the best solution for me as of right now.\n\nI am leaving this edit to let you know that I'm gonna refrain from reading any more comments and stop receiving notifications from this. Eitherway, thanks to those that actually had helpful insight, I appreciate the decency from those who were able to provide it.\n\nEitherway, thanks for your time and.. well, peace out lmao.\n\n(PS: I give 0 fucks if you leave your used condoms in the trash and I see them. It's none of my business. Or if there is washed underwear in the kitchen. Zero. Fucks.)", "created_utc": 1678859641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rnl3x/aita_for_leaving_my_clean_menstrual_cup_by_the/", "score": 349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You only need to use a mild, fragrance free soap to clean it if you\u2019re just going to reinsert it immediately. It kind of sounds like you\u2019re making a loooot of excuses for leaving various menstrual products laying around, even when you\u2019ve been asked to stop. Many cup companies make little case type things (like a collapsible silicone cup with a lid) to store cups in while waiting to be cleaned. It would require such little effort on your part to get a dedicated item for holding the cup. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nWrapping your pads in toilet paper so people don't have to see the blood is just common courtesy.\n\nNot keeping your used cup next to the kitchen sink for days is also just basic hygiene and courtesy.\n\nThe way you react to your cousin, who seems to be quite tolerant, is childish.", "YTA \n\nwhy on earth wouldn't you wrap your used pads?! they are literally packaged in a way that provides the wrap when you change them\n\nand even if you lived with your spouse leaving the cup in the kitchen would be iffy, not to mention living with your cousin", "YTA\n\nYou're actively leaving your menstrual cup by the kitchen sink because in your words, you \"procrastinate\" boiling it. Wrapping up a pad in toilet paper is common sense. It helps hide the smell and it only takes a minute. \n\nThe fact that you think this about women and periods and not the fact that you continuously leave a menstrual cup by the kitchen sink when you know you could just take care of it but choose not to, is ridiculous. \n\nAlso, no one needs to see what you use to get off on.  You're 25 years old. Start having respect for others.", "YTA. I really have to know why you don't roll up the pads because that is so bizarre to me. I always roll mine up in the wrapper of the next pad I'll use or toilet paper. That way, it's compact in the bin and doesn't stick to the trash bag. That wasn't even something I was taught. It just seemed like the appropriate thing to do.\n\nAnd yeah, leaving a menstrual cup by the kitchen sink is gross. Leave it somewhere in plain sight in your room if you need a reminder. Or set a reminder on your phone or something.", "YTA. This isn't one of those situations where a man is getting upset because of a box of pads in the bathroom. You're literally leaving your menstrual cup on the kitchen counter, that's disgusting. You say it's clean but you need to boil it to \"100% complete the cleanse,\" so it's *not* clean. \n\nNo one is asking you to hide the fact that you're a woman and that you have periods, don't be dramatic. Your roommate is just asking you not to leave something that isn't fully clean and has been in your vagina on the kitchen counter.", "This is a troll. OP has commented that they have soaked the cup in hydrogen peroxide, which they absolutely should not be doing. \n\nYou also shouldn\u2019t be cleaning it with soap regularly during your period - simply rinsing well with cold water - as the soap can affect the vaginas natural flora and can also damage the cup. You can buy specific soaps/washes to use.\n\nAfter being cleaned with a specific soap/wash at the end of a period, the cup is clean. As clean as anything else in the kitchen. The boiling is to protect the vagina by sterilising the cup, not the surroundings. Think about the difference between a kitchen knife and a scalpel.", "YTA\n\n\nWhen you live with other people you need to be respectful of differences and deal with them in a mature manner.\n\nRefusing to wrap up.yoir bloody pads and leaving them exposed is unsanitary and gross.\n\nLeaving your menstrual cup in the kitchen is also unsanitary especially since it's not even fully sanitized. As was your dildos.\n\nInstead of just wrapping and keeping your products in your space you tried to be a social justice warrior and prove how womanly you are....forgetting to be a decent human being in the process.\n\nApologize..keep your personal products in your, not shared, space. Set an alarm/reminder on your phone to schedule your boiling. Take out your own trash, all the way to the outside bin, from your personal space.", "It's not generally acceptable to leave bodily fluids around and visible.

Store your menstrual cup in your bathroom, not on the kitchen counter.  I don't care if you washed it, i think you should be more discreet.  Same for the pads in the trash can.

This isn't about your freedom as a woman, it is about not being offensive to others.  Have some respect.", "YTA.\n\nIf you wanna leave your bloody pads unrolled and your cup by the sink just move and live by yourself.\n\nWhat are you a 10 years old kid?\n\nIt's fricking gross.\n\nDo you like see toilet paper with poo in the trash? Because is the same thing with your pads.\n\nAnd the cup by sink is another gross thing. Would you leave a potty near a kitchen sink even though is clean but used?", "Oh dear Lord. This is making me want to throw up, as a fellow female. You don't wrap your pads, that's atrocious, and your menstrual cup in the kitchen? Were you raised by wolves, this is common sense!", "YTA, that is pretty disgusting to leave around the kitchen/sink or anywhere near where food is made", "YTA. Wrap your pads.

You didn't boil it).", "Y\u2019ALL. This is clearly a troll right?? It\u2019s like she\u2019s going out of her way to make it as obvious as possible\n\nShe was too lazy to roll her pads up so she switched to a cup that she thoroughly washes and boils every single time she empties it. Yep makes sense, that\u2019s so much easier than just rolling up a pad\n\nAnd she boils it because it stinks but also she tasted it unboiled once and it didn\u2019t smell at all \n\nCome on now", "YTA-several things wrong here\n\n1. what you do/did with your pads is gross, wrap them up in toilet paper like a normal person\n2. leaving your cup by the sink, even if it's clean, is still gross. keep it in the bathroom, YOUR bathroom. \n3. you actually refuse to wrap them up to the point of getting your own trashcan and than expect him to throw out your bloody pads? I mean come on. \n4. being a woman doesn't mean you can just leave your period stuff everywhere, you don't have to hide your period, but you DO need to apply some class, reasoning and basic decency towards another person that you live with. \n5. and that last part just makes you a petty dick, especially because YOU'RE the one who began this entire issue.", "YTA\n\nIf you're going to have stuff that has been in your vagina on the kitchen counter, everyone in the house needs to agree that's okay. This is a one veto situation. Nobody's asking you to hide that you have periods.

You're not \"tired of having to hide the fact that I am a woman and have periods\". You're going about having periods in a disgusting manner that I as a woman would be grossed out by too. \n\nFirst of all, used, unwrapped pads facing up in a shared bathroom. Second, putting your menstrual cup out in the kitchen and letting it sit there so \"you can remember to boil it\". That's gross. How about you just put it in your room where you can see it? Also, I don't see how the cup over your menstrual cup makes you forget to boil it. Don't you go, \"It's during that time of the month, I need to clean this ASAP\"? \n\nIt sounds like you need to talk to other women to see how to properly take care of your feminine products all while keeping other's needs/preferences/likes in mind. It's not that you have to hide that you're a woman and deal with those things, but you literally need to do a better job of disposing and cleaning them.", "YTA\n\nThis isn't empowerment, it's just being a filth bag.", "YTA. If your cousin is uncomfortable with period by products then that\u2019s up to him, what you\u2019re doing is throwing the fact you have periods and dildos in his face. Can you imagine if he left used condoms or dirty underwear around? That would make you uncomfortable. Also, washing a menstrual cup in the kitchen sink, dude have some compassion and wash it and store it out of view in the bathroom. It\u2019s not that hard.", "Wow! You are so selfish and disrespectful. Just because he\u2019s a man doesn\u2019t mean he gets a say on what makes him uncomfortable in his own home. I\u2019m a woman and this would make me so uncomfortable and grossed out to the point I would refuse to live with you. I just don\u2019t understand how at the age of 25 you don\u2019t know that you wrap up pads either in TP or the plastic wrap the new pad come with. Blood is nasty and will eventually start to smell, nobody wants to see it. Then to add to the fact you are now leaving your cup on the kitchen counter, I don\u2019t care how clean you think it is it\u2019s still nasty. I also hope you are telling him which pan you use to boil it in because if not then you are even worse than anyone thinks you are. If you need help remembering put it in the pan that\u2019s only for boiling and put in your bedroom. As obviously seeing a pan in your room is going to remind you to boil the damn thing. Not only are YTA but are inconsiderate and selfish. Hopefully you don\u2019t end up having no roommate and covering all the rent yourself because that\u2019s what I would do even if your family.", "YTA. I'm a woman. I have used pads and cups. I don't think I'm particularly fussy, but wrapping the pad around itself to keep the blood on the inside and keeping a menstrual cup in a little bag in the bathroom seem like basic things to respect that other people might be using the space to me. Hell, I'd do it even if I lived alone. I wouldn't want someone else's cup in my kitchen. Would you want his clean underwear on your draining board? It's just not the place for it.", "YTA - Clean or not, that's pretty gross. Leave in the bathroom not out in a public space where the food is kept. Vagina, mouth, or asshole doesn't matter. It's been in your body and it's unsanitary. Then leaving your used sex toys all over the kitchen. I couldn't live there.", "YTA\n\nI know I'm gonna get a lot of shit about this, but I was an eighties kid, and had a lot of guy room mates and it was a thing to be discreet back then. I was never a prude, but just like if I cut myself cooking and needed to bandage up, I'd wrap it up before putting things in the trash.\n\nYou are living in a shared space. Most people are not so sensitive about seeing a pad in the trash, but some are. You were asked to not leave the inside of your pads exposed, but you continued to do it. Mind you, cousin is not asking you to HIDE them, but they do not want to see the blood every time they want to throw stuff out. You could have taken a single tissue or even the packet the pad the new pad is wrapped in, to keep it covered. The adhesive on the back of your pad is no longer as adhesive once it's torn off your underwear. You know this by now. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO TAKE OUT YOUR OWN TRASH? They went to the trouble and expense of buying you one, you could at least empty it.\n\nSo this is your hill to die on, so you get a cup. AND CONTINUALLY LEAVE IT IN THE COMMUNITY SPACE. \n If your cousin had company and they asked, what's that on the counter? if he answered, \"Oh my nasty cousin leaves it where the clean dishes are and washes it in the sink, it's getting tired, tbh. Before this she threw unwrapped pads in the trash, open, and I'd have to look at her bloody pads when I'd throw stuff out...She's got this weird obsession with everyone knowing she's got her period and making them see her products\", would you feel like you had a right to be angry? If so, why? Would he have been lying?", "YTA, and I think you know this.  I mean the last part about putting your dildos everywhere and the cup of the faucet was just pure spite.  \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no reason to procrastinate on cleaning the cup.  Especially when it comes to anything in the kitchen.", "You sound like a nightmare to live with.", "YTA- did you mum not teach you anything? \n\nI hope you use a special pot to boil it and not ones you cook with!\n\nYou need to watch some videos on YouTube that teach how to use and dispose of femine hygiene products", "Yta trying not to throw up \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e That's so gross I get it's clean but come on that just yuck", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s is gross and non-typical not to wrap used pads especially in a shared space. In fact it\u2019s courtesy. Not keeping a personally hygiene device in the kitchen counter is courtesy. Emptying your own period trash can is not asking a lot. \n\nThis is not about period shame. This is about respect for common living spaces.", "YTA- had a room mate who would leave hers by the bathroom sink and it just wasnt nice. Periods are a normal part of life but so is sex and you wouldnt want to see used condoms, even if they were washed out ( no one does that, just for arguments sake)\nLeaving it by the kitchen sink is just straight up gross.

So gross. I feel so sorry for your cousin. You are disgusting.", "Are we all just ignoring that they tasted the cup?!?!?!?!?!?!? Also YTA", "YTA and gross.  I'm a woman that is disgusting.  Leaving pads in the trash without wrapping them in TP, why, just why???", "YTA \n\nThere\u2019s a way to dispose & store menstrual products.

If she came into my bathroom, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019d see it lying by the sink but that\u2019s my personal area, not the freaking kitchen sink. \nAlso, why don\u2019t you buy yourself a cup sterilizer? That way, you can sterilize it in your room and it\u2019s a lot quicker. Save yourself the hassle of having to boil it in the kitchen every time.", "YTA. Girl stop. Even another woman would have found all these offensive and gross. Have respect for yourself and others you share space with.", "YTA.

I got a cup cleaner off Amazon which can be folded down flat or opened up in the cup shape, meaning when I leave it out it has it's own container so it's not touching anything else.

Doesn't matter. So long as it's opaque and has a lid.\n\nAnd please. Stop being so obtuse and passive aggressive about it. This IS shared living space.", "YTA for everything; the pads, menstrual cup and dildos. It's not about \"hiding the fact that you're a woman and have periods\", it's about being hygienic and courteous to other people that you live with.\n\n1. I'm a woman; I use pads and tampons. I ***NEVER*** just plop my used feminine care items on the top of the trash bin; They're used and dirty, I don't want someone else to accidentally touch them if they have to put something in the trash or push it down a bit. You don't have to dig in the trash and bury them, but it's seriously not that hard to wrap used tampons in toilet paper to create a little ball around it before throwing it away, or to roll your pads up and wrap it up with it's own wrapper or also wrap it in toilet paper. It keeps others from having to see them, reduces the risk they might accidentally touch them and if we're being 100% honest? Helps to reduce how much you can smell the blood just fucking rotting away in the trash.\n2. Those things ***do not*** belong on or near surfaces where food is prepared or eaten off of, regardless of whether or not it's been cleaned. It's unhygienic. I question his choice to use a drinking cup to cover the menstrual cup, I would've just grabbed it - or if he was uncomfortable directly touching it, used paper towels to grab it - and moved it to the bathroom. You say that it's clean when you leave it on the counter, but then you say that you have to boil it for it to be 100% clean and that you leave it on the counter so that you see it and remember to boil it; you can't have it both ways. If it needs to be boiled to be 100% clean, it's not clean when you leave it on the kitchen counter.\n3. Not only not civil, but immature and - once again - *unhygienic.*\n\nThe problems that I see are inconsideration and procrastination\n\nFor the second one; I get it, I'm a procrastinator too. \"*Just do the task, just finish it in one go\"* is, for people like you and I who have this habit, is easier said than done. We say \"*I'll do/finish it later*\" and then five hours go by and you *still haven;t done the task.* I deal with that a lot, but that is *our problem* and other people being annoyed at us for the effects of our procrastination or the things we leave in the wake of it? They're not wrong for being annoyed or grossed out about it.\n\nFor me, it's dishes. I fucking hate washing dishes and it's a goddamn struggle for me to get dishes cleaned and put away in one go. I'll do some, then while I leave those to dry I'll leave some others to soak in hot soapy water so that they'll be easier to clean when I come back, and I 100% intend to come back and finish them, but sometimes I just....forget.\n\n*Yes* when I left them there to soak, the water was hot and I 100% intended to come back and finish them after a short break, but I didn't because - just like your covered menstrual cup - out of sight, out of mind. Now instead of a sink full of dishes ready to clean, I have a sink full of cold soapy water that needs to be drained. Dirty *and* slimy dishes that still need to be washed, but first need to be moved out of the sink so that the sink itself can be washed.\n\nMy sister, her husband and my roommate aren't wrong for being annoyed with me when I do this, because they're right. I'm the one that needs to work on my procrastination and get to a point where I finish what I'm doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the inconsideration with disposing of pads? Just....just take like 10 seconds to wrap your shit up before disposing of it. It's really not that hard. Or if you're dead set on \"trash is his chore\"...switch chores; have him take one of yours and you take trash.", "This comes across as bait. No one is like that, hopefully. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. As a woman this really grossed me out. Used pads shouldn't be visible and leftcin the garbage because they will stink. Menstrual cups and dildos don't belong in the kitchen!!

How would you feel if your roommate put his clean underwear or jockstrap on the kitchen counter?", "You\u2019re the asshole. You wouldn\u2019t wrap your pads? That\u2019s disgusting. Leaving your menstrual cup in the kitchen is unacceptable. If it needs to be boiled to be truly clean, then you\u2019re leaving an unclean cup by the food and dishes. Live by yourself if you want to leave evidence of your period everywhere. Shitting is normal too but no one wants to see evidence of it.", "Woah, you are way out of line. Have some self respect!! Would you act like this at your place of work???? And how would you feel if another woman did these things around you?? Ewwww, just EWWWWWWWW!!!!", "Is your cousin athletic?

We have our own, separate rooms, but we share the kitchen, bathroom and living space. We first started to have fights about the way I threw away my period pads. Usually I wouldn't roll them up and just throw them into the shared garbage by the toilet, trying to face the blood side downwards, but according to my roommate, the pads would often end up with the bloody side up. We had a huge fight about it and he asked me to buy a separate garbage can for anything of mine (period or non period related.) I refused to buy the garbage can, so he paid for it, and since we had an agreement that I would be doing all the house dishes and he would be taking care of all the garbages, I figured he would take out my \"special\" garbage can too... He did not.\n\nI wanted to stop fighting about this, so I eventually switched from using pads to using a menstrual cup. I figured that a menstrual cup will get rid of any period byproducts or garbage, so the issue would be effectively solved, right?\n\nNo. Now we are fighting about my menstrual cup.\n\nNow, EVERY time I take the cup out (1-2 times a day,) I wash it with soap TWICE, spending about 1-2 min just lathering it up with soap, making sure to clean the inside, the outside, the tail and the suction holes before I re-insert it. I do this regardless of if I need to reinsert it right after or not, it's so clean that I can put the cup in my mouth and I taste nothing but plastic. BUT, I still need to boil the cup to 100% complete the cleanse.\n\nSince I do have a tendency to procrastinate, I would usually leave the CLEAN cup by the kitchen sink, as seeing it would remind me that I still have to boil it. But, since anything that has been inside my vagina is apparently 'disgusting', I start seeing a drinking mug being placed over my menstrual cup. Not too bad of a solution, but I mean, now I don't see the cup, so I forget about needing to boil it. So this devolves into my roommate hiding the menstrual cup under a drinking mug and me removing it every time we walk by the sink. I even put a note, asking him to stop putting mugs over the cup, but he just ignores the note and hides it anyway.\n\nNow, this part I know I did not act in the most civil way possible, but I was so angry that I took out all of my dildos and placed them all over the kitchen. Each dildo is clean, but there's one by the sink, one in the dish drying rack and I fitted the  menstrual cup over the faucet lever.\n\nI know that last part wasn't the best, but I am just so tired of having to hide the fact that I am a woman and have periods. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also why not just do it? \n\nThen on top of that why not put the cup somewhere else than in the shared kitchen? Or just set up a reminder.

You could also just buy one of this special gadgets that disinfects your cup with steam.. Obviously put it in your fucking room and not in the kitchen\n\nAlso a bit unrelated: do not wash your cup with soap as you might damage it and I think it might not be good for your vagina either in case there is still soap residue. Just wash it with water and pop it back in, when you are done with it use an old toothbrush to clean the holes and boil it.", "YTA my god you won\u2019t even roll up your pads, I\u2019m a women and i don\u2019t want to see bloody pads in my bathroom!
