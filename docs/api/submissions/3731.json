He is adamant about no people in the house we don't know. Technically he doesn't know the co-workers., so he's good with idea initially. We also have cats who might get out properly wrangled, front door is only 1 door. \n\nWe both take care to move these items onto the front porch. Especially careful to not scratch up our floors, and the cats were all fooled with treats into a room with no risk of getting out. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, we both see some possible dumpster divers getting into a dumpster of a house that is soon to be listed. I say \"well, it's dark,  but we don't know what they are doing. They might have been told to take what they want, no way to tell. Whether it was illegal or not, if you are getting stuff out of dumpsters you probably need it worse than a landfill does. \"\n\nHe just loses his shit. \"I'm not inviting junk collectors onto our property! I don't want shady people around!\" Literally after all the care we did to not scratch the floors, he pulls this stupid ugly old file cabinet back inside. No thoughts about the cats escaping (indoor only) and no regard for the floor, which he did in fact fuck up. \n\nHe just kept saying he thought people would take stuff off of our porch uninvited. We have patio furniture that cost nearly 1k. It's been on the front porch for 2 years. The furniture on our back deck that also was not cheap. \n\nI told him after he freaked out and threw the old file cabinet back inside, that he was being ridiculous and he should fuck off downstairs for the night. \n\nI feel kind of bad for getting that pissed.  He just kept saying \"No one listens to me!\"  But he had said nothing about these items being on our porch until he saw the \"maybe\" dumpster divers. \n\nI don't know.

The only solution he'd had when trying to rehome the furniture was to call a local outreach service (ok, people you don't know on you're property and most likely serving community service).
