If Penny had expressed discomfort? What is it that your daughter is doing or saying that Penny is complaining about?\n\nCause you seem to be only be focusing on hugging and kissing ... and there are a lot of other ways that an unwanted crush could be uncomfortable for the object of affection. Just because she's a girl, doesn't make respecting other people's boundaries any less important.", "There are two general options here. One option is explaining to your kid that it's great that she has friends, but that she's too young for any of those friends to be a boyfriend or a girlfriend, and that those kinds of relationships are for older people. The second option is to just not push the whole girlfriend thing at all, but just let her hang out with Penny as long as both of them are enjoying it, and realize that the whole \"girlfriend\" thing is likely to fizzle out before it even gets started. Both positions are reasonable.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea at that age for adults to talk about \"your girlfriend\" - just call her Penny.\n\nPerhaps the mom is bigoted because they're both girls, but perhaps the mom is of the first type of parent and thinks that any sort of expression of romance is inappropriate because they're little kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA - this is ridiculous.", "NAH, you have done things pretty much right so far. But same-sex or not, the other parent may be concerned about the somewhat romantic leaning (at least the wording used) by your daughter towards their daughter. That is valid. You should, in my eyes, talk to your daughter about how other people may not be comfortable with being crushed on, and get her to focus on her friendship with Penny, rather than planning any current or future romantic pairing.\n\nYour daughter's feelings are not inappropriate per se - she just has a little crush / infatuation but not everyone at her age is ready to be or talk about being someone's girlfriend/boyfriend/partner and your daughter should be coached on following others' boundaries. Again, it is not that her feelings are wrong or inappropriate or offensive, but it comes down to how she expresses those so as to not make others uncomfortable.", "NAH - Without a little further information on how Penny herself feels about the situation, I'm erring on the side of caution because for all you know it's quite possible that while they are friends your daughter maybe feels a little more strongly about the relationship than her friend does. It's possible that Penny's mother isn't reacting due to the same sex situation so much as her own child having expressed something?", "INFO: Why didn't you ask for specifics on what the inappropriate behavior was?", "NAH, but you should explain the difference between friends and girlfriends to your daughter. She and Penny are friends, there is no romantic love involved, and if you want the girls to continue their friendship, you should take Penny's parents' opinion into account - not for their but for your daughter's sake since she likes this girl so much.", "NTA, they\u2019re 5 years old, it\u2019s just innocent stuff. It\u2019s good that you taught her proper boundaries and consent. So she won\u2019t break people\u2019s boundaries and she can defend herself when someone is doing things she doesn\u2019t like.", "NTA", "NTA. Your daughter is just doing what kids do and not doing anything harmful to anyone. I wouldnt even call it a crush, it isnt romantic feelings. She just likes someone a lot more than others and doesnt know how to classify it correctly, so she calls it her girlfriend. We call it a best friend.", "NTA - At 5, my daughter said she wanted to marry her girl friends too. It is absolutely harmless and in no way should you punish her for it. As we get older we are so conditioned to distrust, to self-protect, to hold back our feelings. Let her experience and enjoy her love for her friends, as long as it is appropriate which it sounds like it is.\n\nIf the other mother approaches you again. Hear her out, show that you respect her perspective but assure her that there is nothing inappropriate and that the girls don't even understand what a romantic relationship is, but that you will monitor the situation and intervene if it starts to turn down an inappropriate path.", "NTA.\n\nI don't wanna jump to conclusions either, but I've heard a ton of people talk about how cute it is for their 5-year-ols to claim they have a \"boyfriend/girlfriend,\" and not take their house-playing seriously. So I am personally inclined to believe it IS the girl-girl aspect.\n\nIt's so silly. Kids don't really know what that stuff means (well, they *know* but they don't *understand* or grasp its implication). A lot of kids also claim they're going to marry one of their parents one day and people think that shit is cute as hell while being 100% more concerning if you were to take it seriously like Penny's mom is. They mimic adults and in their mind, relationships = I really like a person. There probably isn't even a romantic intention, they're just copying the people around them.

I had a \u201cboyfriend\u201d when I was in 2nd grade and all that meant to us was that we\u2019d play in the sandbox together and be on the same soccer team at recess. I definitely think pennys mom is getting too worked about all this. Especially if you\u2019ve done a thorough job of teaching body boundaries and have checked with everyone involved that no physical boundaries have been observed ti have been violated between the kids.

And even if it is something that you do not believe or many people believe is bad, that doesn't make Penny's mom automatically a homophobe projecting onto children. Maybe your daughter did do something inappropriate, and Penny's mom has a right to determine what her kid does (and she is going to fully pull her daughter away from yours).\n\nYes, YTA.

I despise people who tell young children that \"so-and-so is your girlfriend/ boyfriend\". They have no business thinking of young children in terms of romantic relationships.  People will go as far as talking about *babies* having boyfriends/girlfriends. Children don't understand it and adults pushing these ideas on children is disgusting.  Then those kids push those ideas onto other children.  Then you have a whole school full of children running around picking out boyfriends and girlfriends without really understanding what it means. Unfortunately, sometimes, you also have kids teaching other kids what older people *do* when they are boyfriends/girlfriends.

From what I've seen, nowhere has OP talked about their daughter's implied orientation. In the original post, they mention having LGBTQ+ friends as a reference to their daughter's exposure as opposed to older generations who were almost exclusively exposed to heterosexual relationships so that's what they would exclusively mimic.

They're not outright calling Penny's mom a bigot, but they were *concerned* that might be the case but has also stressed they were treading lightly as to not ruin a friendship both girls enjoy. It seems like OP didn't force the issue because they didn't want to offend Penny's mom by insinuating any bigotry and still ruining the friendship between the girls. But I imagine they're *also* nervous that if the mom *is* a bigot (which is a valid concern as there are plenty of them out there), they are then concerned about the welfare of their own child and what she could potentially be exposed to. Parents have to navigate these choppy waters every day and there's never a black-and-white answer to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She isn\u2019t even bothering to make sure her child didn\u2019t act in a way that was harmful towards Penny.\n\nThey did, though.

Then beginning of the school year I had no friends (I am a very shy person and the teacher assistant helped me make friends later on in September), Cody (the boy that I loved) he came up to me and talked to me, then we kept playing throughout the school years, we also would sit together on the school bus in the mornings if I\u2019m not sitting with my friends, I remember there was this ginger boy name Ben during 2nd year, he came to sit next to me and I asked him if he could move since I was saving that for somebody else since Cody was behind him, Cody came up and even asked him if he could move since he always sits next to me. They had a fight until the bus driver had to tell Cody to sit somewhere else and he looked upset.

That's not *pushing a narrative*, that's just making a reasonable assumption. Kid asks someone to be a gf/bf? It's reasonable to suspect they have a crush. That's not assigning a sexuality to a child. I think you're projecting a lot of ideas onto OP. The only time she mentioned LGBTQ stuff was to say her daughter was aware that was something that existed due to family members. \n\nNow, I do think OP should have bit the bullet and asked for clarification from the other mom just to make sure her daughter was behaving appropriately, crush or not.
