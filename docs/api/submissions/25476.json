If Penny had expressed discomfort? What is it that your daughter is doing or saying that Penny is complaining about?\n\nCause you seem to be only be focusing on hugging and kissing ... and there are a lot of other ways that an unwanted crush could be uncomfortable for the object of affection. Just because she's a girl, doesn't make respecting other people's boundaries any less important.", "There are two general options here. One option is explaining to your kid that it's great that she has friends, but that she's too young for any of those friends to be a boyfriend or a girlfriend, and that those kinds of relationships are for older people. The second option is to just not push the whole girlfriend thing at all, but just let her hang out with Penny as long as both of them are enjoying it, and realize that the whole \"girlfriend\" thing is likely to fizzle out before it even gets started. Both positions are reasonable.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea at that age for adults to talk about \"your girlfriend\" - just call her Penny.\n\nPerhaps the mom is bigoted because they're both girls, but perhaps the mom is of the first type of parent and thinks that any sort of expression of romance is inappropriate because they're little kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA - this is ridiculous.", "NAH, you have done things pretty much right so far. But same-sex or not, the other parent may be concerned about the somewhat romantic leaning (at least the wording used) by your daughter towards their daughter. That is valid. You should, in my eyes, talk to your daughter about how other people may not be comfortable with being crushed on, and get her to focus on her friendship with Penny, rather than planning any current or future romantic pairing.\n\nYour daughter's feelings are not inappropriate per se - she just has a little crush / infatuation but not everyone at her age is ready to be or talk about being someone's girlfriend/boyfriend/partner and your daughter should be coached on following others' boundaries. Again, it is not that her feelings are wrong or inappropriate or offensive, but it comes down to how she expresses those so as to not make others uncomfortable.", "NAH - Without a little further information on how Penny herself feels about the situation, I'm erring on the side of caution because for all you know it's quite possible that while they are friends your daughter maybe feels a little more strongly about the relationship than her friend does. It's possible that Penny's mother isn't reacting due to the same sex situation so much as her own child having expressed something?", "INFO: Why didn't you ask for specifics on what the inappropriate behavior was?", "NAH, but you should explain the difference between friends and girlfriends to your daughter. She and Penny are friends, there is no romantic love involved, and if you want the girls to continue their friendship, you should take Penny's parents' opinion into account - not for their but for your daughter's sake since she likes this girl so much.", "NTA, they\u2019re 5 years old, it\u2019s just innocent stuff. It\u2019s good that you taught her proper boundaries and consent. So she won\u2019t break people\u2019s boundaries and she can defend herself when someone is doing things she doesn\u2019t like.", "NTA", "NTA. Your daughter is just doing what kids do and not doing anything harmful to anyone. I wouldnt even call it a crush, it isnt romantic feelings. She just likes someone a lot more than others and doesnt know how to classify it correctly, so she calls it her girlfriend. We call it a best friend.", "NTA - At 5, my daughter said she wanted to marry her girl friends too. It is absolutely harmless and in no way should you punish her for it. As we get older we are so conditioned to distrust, to self-protect, to hold back our feelings. Let her experience and enjoy her love for her friends, as long as it is appropriate which it sounds like it is.\n\nIf the other mother approaches you again. Hear her out, show that you respect her perspective but assure her that there is nothing inappropriate and that the girls don't even understand what a romantic relationship is, but that you will monitor the situation and intervene if it starts to turn down an inappropriate path.", "NTA.\n\nI don't wanna jump to conclusions either, but I've heard a ton of people talk about how cute it is for their 5-year-ols to claim they have a \"boyfriend/girlfriend,\" and not take their house-playing seriously. So I am personally inclined to believe it IS the girl-girl aspect.\n\nIt's so silly. Kids don't really know what that stuff means (well, they *know* but they don't *understand* or grasp its implication). A lot of kids also claim they're going to marry one of their parents one day and people think that shit is cute as hell while being 100% more concerning if you were to take it seriously like Penny's mom is. They mimic adults and in their mind, relationships = I really like a person. There probably isn't even a romantic intention, they're just copying the people around them.

I had a \u201cboyfriend\u201d when I was in 2nd grade and all that meant to us was that we\u2019d play in the sandbox together and be on the same soccer team at recess. I definitely think pennys mom is getting too worked about all this. Especially if you\u2019ve done a thorough job of teaching body boundaries and have checked with everyone involved that no physical boundaries have been observed ti have been violated between the kids.

I'm super paranoid with my kids because I'm a survivor of CSA. I wouldn't get funny with this particular thing but I definitely am known to be wary of other kids and adults. You don't know this Mums experiences, so try to be empathetic and reassuring that your child understands boundaries etc.\n\nAll that said, this is a totally innocent thing.

I despise people who tell young children that \"so-and-so is your girlfriend/ boyfriend\". They have no business thinking of young children in terms of romantic relationships.  People will go as far as talking about *babies* having boyfriends/girlfriends. Children don't understand it and adults pushing these ideas on children is disgusting.  Then those kids push those ideas onto other children.  Then you have a whole school full of children running around picking out boyfriends and girlfriends without really understanding what it means. Unfortunately, sometimes, you also have kids teaching other kids what older people *do* when they are boyfriends/girlfriends.

So I am personally inclined to believe it IS the girl-girl aspect.\n\nI know plenty of parents who really dislike this - regardless of gender. My child had a few 'I want to marry my friend' moments and we gently explained that marriage is a choice between two grown ups and we should just have precious friends at this age.\n\nWe've also had her be really upset over another kid saying this to her like she didn't have a choice (you *are* my girlfriend kind of language) \n\nI don't think it's that weird to explain language is a boundary also.", "I didn\u2019t really laugh, I was just surprised and said I had not been made aware of any issues between the 2 kids.

That\u2019s beyond inappropriate.\n\nBoth children will figure out their sexualities once they hit puberty. Statistically, they\u2019ll most likely both be straight. Either way, you don\u2019t get to decide this for them. That\u2019s their own business, not yours.\n\nI feel bad for Penny and your daughter. You\u2019re going to ruin their friendship, all because you keep making everyone uncomfortable by pushing this narrative you\u2019ve created.", "Don't assume bigotry on the offset. Penny's mom has every right to protect her daughter if she feels something inappropriate is happening. Be the adult and have a calm discussion with her mom to get specifics on what she she's uncomfortable with. She very well may be a bigot but you won't know unless you actually try to solve the problem.", "You\u2019re getting downvoted, but these people are homophobes. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.", "You\u2019ll never know what her actual issue is if you don\u2019t ask dude.

To tell them off for doing sexual pathologises and sexualises something totally innocent. \n\nI agree there is some deeply gross encouragement from adults about this sort of thing sometimes, but that doesn't mean that applies in every case and I think people need to be very careful about how to approach if they want them to stop, if the case is that it's something the child has chosen to do by themselves.", "\u201cFuture heart breaker!\u201d \ud83e\udd2e", "Obvs NTA if her objection is purely that a little girl can\u2019t have a GF. Especially if she explicitly stated that\u2019s what she finds inappropriate. In that case her entire issue is that she\u2019s a homophobe. I didn\u2019t mean to be flip, it\u2019s great that consent conversations are happening it\u2019s just also true that you can make someone uncomfortable without physical touch. I wanted to be sure that it was in fact the GF title she found objectionable.", "Have you asked your daughter what being/having a girlfriend means to her? For all we know, her understanding of a girlfriend is just a best friend you get to play with all the time. If she means something else, then maybe it requires a conversation. Until you know, there is no way to know how to approach the situation.", "That changes a lot compared to what you have written in the post. Penny's mom is in her right to call it inappropriate - as would many parents, and it does not have to be the gender/sexual orientation issue, just the children's age and not understanding the meaning of the labels they claim, especially when it's done for someone else (your daughter announcing that Penny is her gf) . And her request is quite clear - teach your daughter the difference between friends and bf/gf.", ">OP is trying to turn this into something it isn\u2019t. She\u2019s decided in her mind that her child must be gay and refuses to see her child\u2019s behaviour for what it is; normal excitement.\n\nUnless I missed a comment, I have no idea where you got this information. From what I've seen, nowhere has OP talked about their daughter's implied orientation. In the original post, they mention having LGBTQ+ friends as a reference to their daughter's exposure as opposed to older generations who were almost exclusively exposed to heterosexual relationships so that's what they would exclusively mimic. But from what I've seen, OP hasn't implied at all they think her daughter is a lesbian. They've stressed \"friendship\" several times\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, she refuses to ask Penny\u2019s mum about what her daughter did that was \u201cinappropriate\u201d.\n\nFrom everything I've seen, OP is just trying to figure out how to navigate an awkward situation with another parent. Everyone knows better in retrospect, everyone knows better when they're a third party and not in the moment. They're not outright calling Penny's mom a bigot, but they were *concerned* that might be the case but has also stressed they were treading lightly as to not ruin a friendship both girls enjoy. It seems like OP didn't force the issue because they didn't want to offend Penny's mom by insinuating any bigotry and still ruining the friendship between the girls. But I imagine they're *also* nervous that if the mom *is* a bigot (which is a valid concern as there are plenty of them out there), they are then concerned about the welfare of their own child and what she could potentially be exposed to. Parents have to navigate these choppy waters every day and there's never a black-and-white answer to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She isn\u2019t even bothering to make sure her child didn\u2019t act in a way that was harmful towards Penny.\n\nThey did, though. They asked the teacher, a third party with no horse in this race, who confirmed there was nothing sus afoot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom your comment history... I think you're a bit more obsessed with the sexuality of these children than anyone involved is. Quite frankly, it's disturbing. Especially when that isn't even the actual topic at hand and you keep bringing it up.", "They\u2019re 5\u2026 I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re gay or not, but based on what I read, Penny\u2019s mom is the one who is uncomfortable. \n\nIf Penny is uncomfortable, I get it, but if it\u2019s just the mom being uncomfortable with the language\u2026 I don\u2019t care. They\u2019re 5. Some kids are dinosaurs or dogs or whatever at that age. I don\u2019t see the harm in saying she has a girlfriend.

They\u2019re too young to choose a career path but might still want to play astronauts or firefighters or doctors. Why not let them hold hands or kiss on the cheek or whatever they want to do since it\u2019s just make-believe at that age anyway?", "The daughter doesn\u2019t have an issue, the mom does. OP even asked the teacher, and both girls play together nicely and have no issues.", "What?! I never said my daughter is gay. She is 5 years old.

In like 5th grade he tried to ask me out and I didn't know what to do so I ran away, and we had a bit of a falling out, for a couple years, then in middle school we were friends again and then freshman year of high school I asked him out. Turns out he was an asshole who led me on for myself months then posted shit on Facebook about how white girls are undatable (he's half Hawaiian half Japanese, I'm white) after his sister told my brother at the grocery store that he had no plans to actually go on a date with me. Till the mess in high school it was mostly just sorta sweet and cute, and both of our parents tried to convince us to go to the 6th grade dance together because it was super obvious to like everyone that we had liked each other for years (his parents actually apologized to mine for how he acted later).

Whereas I'm pretty sure if I'd said yes we would have just kept hanging out and playing house and going for bike rides (with his dad going with us), and maybe we would have kissed at some point, but like it wasn't till like 2 years later I actually stopped thinking kissing was gross, so doubt it.

It has potential to get cemented into a very toxic attitude if not stopped immediately. \n\n1) Your daughter needs to learn that when a person says no, that is final.

Here, unless we hear otherwise from Penny\u2019s mom, all evidence suggests OP\u2019s daughter and Penny are happily playing together.

We don't know in what way, because OP ducked the conversation.\n\nWhereas the only \"evidence\" that there *isn't* a problem is OP saying she has discussed boundaries. So do most parents - doesn't mean it doesn't occasionally need reinforcing / repeating.\n\nIncidentally, it's even possible that it *is* about the girlfriend thing and Penny has expressed discomfort because her mum is a bigot and she knows it would cause trouble! And if that's the case, it is a reasonable (and self-protective) boundary for Penny to have, and a good ally would not encourage their child to violate it."]}
