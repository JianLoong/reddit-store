If Penny had expressed discomfort? What is it that your daughter is doing or saying that Penny is complaining about?\n\nCause you seem to be only be focusing on hugging and kissing ... and there are a lot of other ways that an unwanted crush could be uncomfortable for the object of affection. Just because she's a girl, doesn't make respecting other people's boundaries any less important.", "There are two general options here. One option is explaining to your kid that it's great that she has friends, but that she's too young for any of those friends to be a boyfriend or a girlfriend, and that those kinds of relationships are for older people. The second option is to just not push the whole girlfriend thing at all, but just let her hang out with Penny as long as both of them are enjoying it, and realize that the whole \"girlfriend\" thing is likely to fizzle out before it even gets started. Both positions are reasonable.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea at that age for adults to talk about \"your girlfriend\" - just call her Penny.\n\nPerhaps the mom is bigoted because they're both girls, but perhaps the mom is of the first type of parent and thinks that any sort of expression of romance is inappropriate because they're little kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA - this is ridiculous.", "NAH, you have done things pretty much right so far. But same-sex or not, the other parent may be concerned about the somewhat romantic leaning (at least the wording used) by your daughter towards their daughter. That is valid. You should, in my eyes, talk to your daughter about how other people may not be comfortable with being crushed on, and get her to focus on her friendship with Penny, rather than planning any current or future romantic pairing.\n\nYour daughter's feelings are not inappropriate per se - she just has a little crush / infatuation but not everyone at her age is ready to be or talk about being someone's girlfriend/boyfriend/partner and your daughter should be coached on following others' boundaries. Again, it is not that her feelings are wrong or inappropriate or offensive, but it comes down to how she expresses those so as to not make others uncomfortable.", "NAH - Without a little further information on how Penny herself feels about the situation, I'm erring on the side of caution because for all you know it's quite possible that while they are friends your daughter maybe feels a little more strongly about the relationship than her friend does. It's possible that Penny's mother isn't reacting due to the same sex situation so much as her own child having expressed something?", "INFO: Why didn't you ask for specifics on what the inappropriate behavior was?", "NAH, but you should explain the difference between friends and girlfriends to your daughter. She and Penny are friends, there is no romantic love involved, and if you want the girls to continue their friendship, you should take Penny's parents' opinion into account - not for their but for your daughter's sake since she likes this girl so much.", "NTA, they\u2019re 5 years old, it\u2019s just innocent stuff. It\u2019s good that you taught her proper boundaries and consent. So she won\u2019t break people\u2019s boundaries and she can defend herself when someone is doing things she doesn\u2019t like.", "NTA", "NTA. Your daughter is just doing what kids do and not doing anything harmful to anyone. I wouldnt even call it a crush, it isnt romantic feelings. She just likes someone a lot more than others and doesnt know how to classify it correctly, so she calls it her girlfriend. We call it a best friend.", "NTA - At 5, my daughter said she wanted to marry her girl friends too. It is absolutely harmless and in no way should you punish her for it. As we get older we are so conditioned to distrust, to self-protect, to hold back our feelings. Let her experience and enjoy her love for her friends, as long as it is appropriate which it sounds like it is.\n\nIf the other mother approaches you again. Hear her out, show that you respect her perspective but assure her that there is nothing inappropriate and that the girls don't even understand what a romantic relationship is, but that you will monitor the situation and intervene if it starts to turn down an inappropriate path.", "NTA.\n\nI don't wanna jump to conclusions either, but I've heard a ton of people talk about how cute it is for their 5-year-ols to claim they have a \"boyfriend/girlfriend,\" and not take their house-playing seriously. So I am personally inclined to believe it IS the girl-girl aspect.\n\nIt's so silly. Kids don't really know what that stuff means (well, they *know* but they don't *understand* or grasp its implication). A lot of kids also claim they're going to marry one of their parents one day and people think that shit is cute as hell while being 100% more concerning if you were to take it seriously like Penny's mom is. They mimic adults and in their mind, relationships = I really like a person. There probably isn't even a romantic intention, they're just copying the people around them. BUT OH LAWD NO, Little Penny is gunna grow up to be a lesbian now because she had a \"girlfriend\" when she was five! If anything, Penny's mom is over-sexualizing a harmless label on a friendship.\n\nSilly.", "NTA", "NTA - Let your kid be a kid. She'll find out how cruel the world is on her own.

I had a \u201cboyfriend\u201d when I was in 2nd grade and all that meant to us was that we\u2019d play in the sandbox together and be on the same soccer team at recess. I definitely think pennys mom is getting too worked about all this. Especially if you\u2019ve done a thorough job of teaching body boundaries and have checked with everyone involved that no physical boundaries have been observed ti have been violated between the kids.

I'm super paranoid with my kids because I'm a survivor of CSA. I wouldn't get funny with this particular thing but I definitely am known to be wary of other kids and adults. You don't know this Mums experiences, so try to be empathetic and reassuring that your child understands boundaries etc.\n\nAll that said, this is a totally innocent thing.

And even if it is something that you do not believe or many people believe is bad, that doesn't make Penny's mom automatically a homophobe projecting onto children.

I despise people who tell young children that \"so-and-so is your girlfriend/ boyfriend\". They have no business thinking of young children in terms of romantic relationships.  People will go as far as talking about *babies* having boyfriends/girlfriends. Children don't understand it and adults pushing these ideas on children is disgusting.  Then those kids push those ideas onto other children.  Then you have a whole school full of children running around picking out boyfriends and girlfriends without really understanding what it means. Unfortunately, sometimes, you also have kids teaching other kids what older people *do* when they are boyfriends/girlfriends.

So I am personally inclined to believe it IS the girl-girl aspect.\n\nI know plenty of parents who really dislike this - regardless of gender. My child had a few 'I want to marry my friend' moments and we gently explained that marriage is a choice between two grown ups and we should just have precious friends at this age.\n\nWe've also had her be really upset over another kid saying this to her like she didn't have a choice (you *are* my girlfriend kind of language) \n\nI don't think it's that weird to explain language is a boundary also.", "I didn\u2019t really laugh, I was just surprised and said I had not been made aware of any issues between the 2 kids.

I have difficulty with adults framing young children's friendships in adult relationship terms and I know I'm rowing against the tide, but I do discourage that kind of language from my daughter when I hear it.\n\nI haven't any concern about touching etc I don't think there have been any instances, I just think there's time enough for that kind of talk later on.", "Ngl I do think it's not suuuper appropriate - even if I think the Mum in question was a bit rude about it. Not sure I'd say 'inappropriate' but it's on that uncomfortable in between line where it really depends on perception. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of kids doing the bf/gf type thing. When my daughter talked about marrying her friends I would tell her that's lovely but explain it might make them uncomfortable to talk about because it's an adult decision - it's okay to love them but two grown ups have to decide if they want to get married so maybe they can just be really special friends.\n\nSo whilst she said those things - I never actually encouraged them because I don't think kids should be playing at adult relationships. Obviously I never shamed her for them or anything. We just parent in an extremely hyper aware place when it comes to boundary setting and understanding appropriate behaviour. \n\nPersonally I do think you should tell your child to not be saying those things to another child. It's okay to think things privately but we shouldn't be encouraging young kids to make a game of adult relationships.", "Penny's mom is way OTT. If there was a boy who was Penny's friend and respected boundaries but said she was his gf most likely the mom would be fine with it.", "Okay but did you ask the mom?", "Teach yourself how to fuckin read Jesus Christ", "Posts like this make me realize that stats saying over half of Americans read below a 10th grade level are actually true", "If you actually read my post you would already know that my daughter HAS been taught all of that. And the teachers that observe the kids together all day long have confirmed that none of that has happened. \n\nWhat are you even talking about", "I definitely hate it as a parent... Actually I recall hating it as a kid too lol. I remember kids getting fake married and hiding to kiss and it made me uncomfortable even when I was little. \n\nMy friends daughter is currently having a falling out with another friend (all six up) because of gf bf drama. I was gobsmacked that was a thing lol.", "Christ, playground relationships are as old as time and not that deep. As long as everyone is being respectful there\u2019s nothing to change", "This is how kids learn, by copying things they see around him. Children have been playing with baby dolls for centuries, pretending to be mommy and daddy. If you consider how babies are made, you could call that utterly creepy, but this is simply how kids learn.\n\nI had a boyfriend in kindergarten when I was 4. He had broken his ankle and I used to push his little wheelchair. We were going to get married and have babies and everything, it just seemed like that was how that should work out. Then when his ankle was healed he didn\u2019t want to be my boyfriend anymore. I remember feeling some slight disappointment about that.. but what I remember most is that it really wasn\u2019t any different than the other things I played at. It had nothing to do with actual relationships, just like pretending playing with baby dolls has nothing to do with being a parent. There was no kissing or even holding hands. It was just a word that sounded interesting and a 4yo girl, pushing a 4yo boy\u2019s wheelchair for a few weeks, until both moved on to other games. It was just cute.\n\nKids learn to understand the world by copying things they see around them, as long as nothing concerning or dangerous happens, it\u2019s not really beneficial to get in the way of their natural development.", "When my daughter came home and told us about Penny being her girlfriend- she specifically said she asked her if she\u2019d be her girlfriend when they got older, and Penny said yes. \nShe knows that you have to be a grown up to be in a relationship or get married. We didn\u2019t make a big deal about it because I did not want to encourage or discourage any further behavior. My daughter is a stubborn little thing - as soon as we tell her no to something, that\u2019s all she wants. So we brushed it off, and only refer to Penny as her friend.", "I replied that I was not aware of anything inappropriate that happened. I didn\u2019t specifically ask - but her words to me were that my daughter was telling other friends that Penny is her girlfriend and that\u2019s inappropriate", "I never fake-married anyone as a kid, and don't recall actually wanting to. But I definitely had an aversion to the concept after the first grade. Blew a kiss to a boy and he stabbed me in the face with a pencil. Still have a lead \"beauty dot\" on my face over 20 years later from it. After that, I was pretty much over the idea of playing house.", "Sounds like you were a jealous outcast on the playground and now hold that grudge.", "You know, I have given my perspective some thought and I'm comfortable with it. So it's not going to change. I just offer it as an example of what the other mother may be thinking.", "Again, I personally would discourage bf/gf type language. I would also ask further questions re Penny's Mum - or just explain to your child that Penny's Mum is uncomfortable with them playing girlfriends.\n\nI just personally prefer to err on the side of caution with this stuff", "I wouldn't like it if I was her mom.  Many people don't want to feel forced to discuss things until they think their children are ready.\n\nThat said, I don't know how you could have handled it any better.  Seems like neither of you are AH and it's hard raising little kids right now.", "Oh my god hahahaha that is one helluva tale. I can't believe you were permanently marked. God.. that's so hectic lmao.", "Lmao what? I was five. I don't even remember who the kids were. I just remember thinking it was dumb", "Honestly though, if the other mother wasn't coming from a bigoted place, she would have brought up that it wasn't the fact that it's two girls.", "Yeah... I still remember us both being dragged off to the office, me with blood streaming down my face and him repeating \"I forgot the pencil was in my hand!\" I'm not sure who was crying more. I have absolutely no recollection of what happened to him, punishment-wise.\n\nI remember being a teenager and a buddy asked me, \"Why don't women make the first move?\" And I was just like, \"Well... I can't speak for all women, but...\"", "> I remember being a teenager and a buddy asked me, \"Why don't women make the first move?\" And I was just like, \"Well... I can't speak for all women, but...\"\n\nThis is so glorious. Like.. very unfortunate and all. But thanks for sharing haha."]}
