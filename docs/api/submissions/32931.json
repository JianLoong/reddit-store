I have not seen her since his death seven years ago. I kept minimal contact with my half siblings (15 and 16) through her but not closely either. My relationships with them were complicated and I do not care for the woman at all. My former stepmother's brother contacted me and told me she needs someone to take care of her now and it should not fall on my half siblings and cannot fall on him as he lives in another state. Her condition is terminal and they believe she has less than a year left.\n\nI was told by her brother that I should take responsibility for helping to care for her given she was my stepmother for many years of my life and she is the mother to the two kids I should be willing to take in once she has passed. He told me refusing to care for their mother is going to permanently end my relationship with them.\n\nFor those wondering about background. My mom and my former stepmother were very close friends and before my mom's death, my former stepmother and father betrayed her by carrying out an affair. I overheard the fight when my mom found out the truth. Once my mom had passed my former stepmother decided to create a huge scene at my mom's funeral and insulted my mom's parents and insulted her sisters for saying my former stepmother had no place at the funeral. She tried to say as my future stepmother and my mom's closest friend she would always have a place. I called her names that day. She told me I would regret it one day. That day has never come. But she did revel in telling me all my mom's flaws after she and my dad married. I never saw dad the same way either. But he refused to let the relationship go completely and did his best to maintain contact once I left his house. He died when I was 20.\n\nI told him I would not care for his sister and I made it very clear to him that I was not going to make her end of life any easier than she made my mom's. My half siblings called me and told me their mom was asking for me and they were scared and wanted me to be there at the end. They said she needs someone to help her and they can only do so much with school, that they hate leaving her alone. I told them I was sorry and I knew what it was like to watch your mom slowly fade, but that I was not the one to do it. My half brother asked if I didn't love her at all after all this time. I said no. He told me to stay the hell away then and from them as well.\n\nMy father's sister heard about all that happened and she told me I should be more mature than that and I should be more loving and compassionate to my half siblings. She told me I should love them more than I hate their mom and agree to care for her to make their next year a lot less stressful. When I refused she called me a cruel and selfish person and she told me I was behaving like the very person I hated the most.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702464375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18he520/aita_for_refusing_to_help_care_for_my_former/", "score": 2020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I remember how burnt out my mum was when she took over caring for my grandad when he was dying, and that was only for three weeks. And my mum was a nurse who had worked palliative care, she was very experienced. \n\nThis woman is not related to you biologically, and you do not have a familial relationship with her. She's not your responsibility, and agreeing to be someone's carer is a *lot.* If she's dying, she likely needs 24 hour care, or near enough. You'll either have to do that yourself or pay for at-home carers, and it sounds like that expensive cost will be footed by you alone, since the step-sibs appear to be underage and the siblings of your ex-stepmum are trying to palm her off on you. You'll be in charge of everything, the work and the cost, it will all be on you.\n\nI can understand not wanting her kids to act as carers given they're still in school. But she has siblings who can take on that role. And if they can't or won't, then it's up to those siblings to pay for her to go into hospice care. They can't palm off their responsibilities onto an unrelated person that has zero relationship to her. \n\nTelling you to have compassion is fine, but compassion is not giving up your life and financial stability to care for someone who may as well be a stranger. Compassion is simply feeling bad for them and offering what support you're comfortable offering, even if that's just a phonecall once a week to see how they're coping. Telling you to have love? That's over the line. That's not a feeling you can control. I can't tell from your post how you feel about the step-sibs, whether you love them as siblings or not, but that's not an emotion you can force. And there's certainly no love for their mother. On top of that, loving someone does not mean caring for those people's mother that you have zero relationship with.\n\nYou may have to accept being cut off by the step-sibs. But if you have money and they don't, I doubt it will last long. If not the kids, then their uncle will likely force contact to start again. This does seem to be being pushed by the uncle more than anyone else, so I'd guess this is all his idea, and he's convinced the kids. \n\nStand your ground. Do not burn yourself out physically, emotionally and financially for a woman you're not related to, have no relationship with, and don't love. Anyone else pushing you into this, just tell them you're not a carer, no one's offering to pay you for providing full-time care, and this woman has zero relationship to you.

When I refused, she called me a cruel and selfish person, and she told me I was behaving like the very person I hated the most. She's a piece of work, too! Why isn't she taking care of her?

It's a lot to ask anyone to take on caregiver responsibilities under the best of circumstances. This -- is the absolute worst of circumstances. It would be different if you were closer to your (former) stepmother and half-siblings, but you made your feelings clear before your father died. Also, her family has terrible communication skills, to give you an ultimatum when they have no relationship with you to leverage. They're looking for the easy way out and it's easier for her brother to offload responsibility for his sister and your half-siblings to you. Also, notice who is not reaching out to you. Your former stepmother. Yes, she's terminally ill and has a year to live or less. She's communicating with someone though, is she not? This woman took pleasure in seeking to tarnish your mother's legacy in your eyes. She betrayed your mother's friendship and took advantage of your mother's trust -- and your father was part of that as well. She has not demonstrated one ounce of remorse yet her family expects you to step in and take care of her. \n\nHere's the thing: you have the right to say no for any reason. This is a lot to ask. There are a lot of conditions, a lot of questions that would need to be answered before any sane person would commit to take this on -- emotional issues aside. But no one has reached out to you in any respectful way. Your half-siblings aside, your former stepmother and her brother are takers. Your brother's sister is an enabler. Say no and cut your losses. Oh wait, you've already lost pretty much everything that mattered to you. \n\nHaving said all of that, if you believe you owe something to your half-siblings, consider exactly what that might be and what kind of relationship you want with them going forward. And be brutally honest with yourself. It's okay to not want to maintain any relationships with any of them. It's okay to want to support them without agreeing to be a caregiver in this situation. Based on what you've described, I advise caution. There's too much emotion driving the bus here, not just your feelings towards your former stepmother. They are pushing you too hard to take on a responsibility that your former stepmother should already have a plan for. Yes, I know most people don't plan ahead, but this isn't her first rodeo.

Your half siblings are perfectly capable of taking care of their biological mother. Their shared blood with their mother will give them the strength they need.

So 15 and 16 is definitely capable of cleaning the house, making meals, feeding her medications, grocery shopping, helping her shower, and coordinating with healthcare workers and social workers. It is, honestly, not too much for them to handle. And if they, the biological, blood-related family can't do it, how can you with no blood relations? \n\nFurthermore, it is not a 1 year commitment. You will be responsible for your half siblings to launch into adulthood, as well. So, you are being conscripted to give up your life and potential growth for your half siblings.
