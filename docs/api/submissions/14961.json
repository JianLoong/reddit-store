It doesn't seem like he PLANNED to get so drunk he would be miserable and vomiting the next day. \n\nYou mentioned he tried getting anyone and everyone to cover his shift, so it's not like he woke up sick and immediately asked you to sacrifice your day off. Unless this is repeated behavior, I would work the shift for my partner. I'd even bring them home things that would make them feel better. Everyone has an oops once in a while, and I would HOPE they had a supportive partner who would help them.", "NTA. I overdid it one night and ended up still tipsy at work the next day.
