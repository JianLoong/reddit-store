But it wouldn't be awful to consider it IF he would do it for you and he's a good partner. It's also not a crime to prioritize your mental health because days off are important. If he can cover one of your shifts to give you a day off in the next couple days in exchange, also an option.\n\nIf he's not the kind of partner where he would return the favor or do this for you, then definitely not. Don't do it.", "NTA.  Can understand why he thinks you are, but that hangover is his problem not yours or anyone else's.", "NTA, he got drunk knowing he had to work.

If you work the next day, don't drink so much that it's going to be a problem. You're entitled to your day off.", "NTA. He knows how alcohol works and presumably he knew he had to work.

Yes he\u2019s supposed to be an adult, but he\u2019s pretty miserable right now. I\u2019m sure he learned his lesson unless he does this often. If he goes into work today, he will probably be so out of it and throwing up that he will be fired for being irresponsible.\n\nDoes the restaurant know he\u2019s hungover?

How would you feel if the shoe was on the other foot? Would you agree to it if was a straight shift swap with the day of your choosing?\n\nHow often does he drink to excess or do things like this and ask you to cover for him? That is an important point to have noted for us to decide who, if anyone, is the AH.\n\nIt\u2019s his fault for getting so drunk when he knows he had a shift to do, but how enjoyable is your day off really going to be with this hanging over you?", "NTA.

Is it entirely his own fault and responsibility to deal with the consequences of his choices? Absolutely. But people do make mistakes and bad decisions sometimes, and it\u2019s nice to be in a relationship (or friendship) where you help each other deal with those consequences when you can. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an asshole for not covering for him, but I do think you\u2019d be establishing a precedent in your relationship where you don\u2019t help each deal with your mistakes.
