On the other hand, if he's throwing up because he drank quantities humans really shouldn't consumed and only stopped drinking 3-4 hours ago, then idk if I'd feel the need to rescue him as much.\n\nEither way, even though you are his girlfriend, if you work together, you should have the same right to refused to take his shift as other co-workers, or at least it should be \\*close\\*. You already see how he's doing up close and personal, that's enough of a push to take his shift.\n\nThere are a number of factors that could influence what I think you should do.\n\n1) Sometimes \\*really\\* looking forward to a day off means that fulfilling that is pretty important for your mental health well being. Working instead will take a toll. You'll go without the restorative time and have a messier house until your next day off, and not fulfilling the expectation can be hard to adjust to. It takes more of a toll on some people than others, and I've learned not to judge people harshly for saying, \"Nope, this is really important to my wellbeing, even though I feel for your situation.\"\n\n2) If you do think you could trade days with him, particularly if this is rare and he might be ill/with migraine, then perhaps he can help in other ways as well, too, like cleaning. \n\nI think you have the right to keep your day off either way, and he should stop begging, but if it's more that he's sick or has a migraine and if it were me, I'd probably take the shift, in all honestly.", "Im a chef, sometimes you have to work hungover.

If I were in your bf's shoes, I'd hate myself for putting myself in that position. While I'd understand your saying no, I would also tell myself that if the situation were I'd help you out.\n\nIn your shoes, my question to myself would be if my partner has an established pattern or if it is a one off.

I get that you were looking forward to a day off, but this is where compromise and communication come into play within a relationship. You can express your frustration and disappointment about covering his shift (but willingness to do it because you want to help your significant other) but propose the compromise that he take your next shift so you can still have a day off.

I was a chef for many years and spent a lot of time with both alcoholic coworkers and an alcoholic partner. I don't know if that's the case in your situation, but enabling their alcoholism is not helpful in the long run. I am still with my partner, and it was a challenging time to work through together. For me it was worth the effort, but I just wanted to express by sympathy for your situation. Ultimately I gave him an ultimatum and told him he had to get help (he chose to go to therapy instead of AA or something) and now he hasn't binged in several years.

You were not on the schedule to work today, therefore it\u2019s not your responsibility to clean up his mess. He wouldn\u2019t be resentful towards you if you didn\u2019t work together, he would have no choice but to call off for the day.

But if you aren't willing to help out your partner when they are down and in need, why are you even in a relationship?\n\nAs others have pointed out, a firm ruling would require more context. Is he regularly shit faced and unable to tend to his responsibilities? Then that is a him issue, not a you issue. Is he typically responsible and getting so drunk he can't work the next day is a one off? Probably worth it to just help out your partner. As others have said, he can bail you out the next time.\n\nSince we don't have that context, I can only go off of what's presented in the post. I am a firm believer that relationships and partnerships are about being a team. If you are unwilling to be a part of a team for him and helping him in his time of need, then I'd re-evaluate why you are in a relationship to begin with, and if im him, im re-evaluating if I want to be with someone who can't be bothered to help me out when I'm down.", "I'd say YTA.

He can't come to work because he keeps throwing up. Period. You don't have to justify being sick if it doesn't happen on a regular basis. He has no obligation to disclose why he's throwing up whatsoever.", "Why on earth would you ever freely admit anything to your employer that they can then use against you in the future. They can be mad you called in because you were vomiting but that happens sometimes, that is nothing to the consequences likely to ensue if you tell them you're calling out because you are vomiting because you got lashed the night before. Never give that reason, in fact it's probably better if wherever possible you try as best you can to ensure nobody from your work knows you are having any kind of drinking session. That way there can never be that guy who goes \"oh X isn't really sick, they were out with F and S last night.\" What you either don't tell or don't elaborate on at your work can sometimes be inferred but can never really be pinned down and actioned if you're careful.", "Lol, I\u2019ve told my manager that I had the brown bottle flu a few times through the years. It doesn\u2019t happen very often. He laughed told me to rest, drink plenty of fluids and he would see me the next day. It helps that I have flex sick days and emergency PTO. Also being in the union helps a lot. I also told him I was in no shape to drive when I took a prescribed muscle relaxer with a heavy sedative a little later at night than usual and woke up slobbering and stumbling around.", "those positions are also a dime a dozen. The consequences may be having to find another job, too.", "And you blame them right back for not adequately staffing the business.", "Even dead they probably want you to find a replacement these days.", "The restaurant business now sucks total ass. At least on the corporate level", "I think if the relationship is reciprocal (admittedly we don\u2019t know here), then sometimes being a good partner or friend means doing something you don\u2019t want to do. If OP\u2019s boyfriend is otherwise reliable and supportive and has shown he\u2019s willing to put aside his interests to help her, and if this is a one-time screw-up/anomaly, I think you can still say it\u2019d be good to help him out and take the shift.", "Wow!  So you nope out of a relationship if you have to do something you weren\u2019t planning to do or want to do?  You will have some lonely days to do exactly what you want to do. Does this also apply to jobs, friends, family?  Sometimes in life you do things you don\u2019t want to for the sake of someone else. It\u2019s called being human towards others. \n\nAs far as OP, if this is a one time thing, then yes,  YTA. If it is a common thing, then you\u2019re NTA. One is about kindness. The other about consequences.", "No that's called being  self-centered and selfish. \nYes of course you need yo make sure you care for yourself as well but a partner will help the other person when they need it. It is not a partnership if you only look out for you.", "People are allowed to make mistakes. And if he's as sick as she's describing, he is already experiencing consequences.", "This will vary state by state, but pregnancy is the only exception I can find, and even that requires notification and monitoring in my state. No other reason for throwing up has any protection, because it\u2019s considered too great a food safety risk. You could be throwing up from alcohol or pregnancy issues and still contaminate food.", "I'd be quite disappointed if my partner decided to go out and get so drunk he couldn't leave his bed, despite having to go to work to the next day, and then expecting me to cover the shift?\n\nIf he was genuinely ill and didn't self inflict a hangover it would be a different story, but he would be fit and able for work if he hadn't drank too much.  If he couldn't hack work on a hangover, he shouldn't have had an impromptu night out and if it wasn't a last minute thing, he should have got someone to cover his shift or asked OP earlier.  Why should OP give up their day off and swap it to another day just because the boyfriend can't plan ahead/control himself?", "This is amazing\u2026", "Love this!", "Then the responsible decision would be to *not drink at all* the night before work.", "Yeah no definitely have the guy handling your food to be puking all over the place. \n\nGet real. He cant fucking work.", "The correct answer is that sick days should be provided so that *neither* of you has to go in.", "No. It is OPs day off and they have plans. They have no obligation to change their plans. Either the boyfriend finds someone else or sucks it up and goes in to work.", "LMAO she's 37", "this is the answer", "Might be able to get away with that in food service, but that doesn\u2019t work everywhere. \n\nPersonal experience since my job history includes delivery services and the consequences for showing up hung over or potentially still drunk didn\u2019t stop at losing your job", "Never said I did. Have seen others do it. Those that would drink like that have never been the brightest bunch. Especially the one driver I knew in passing that tried coming in hungover and stinking of all drunk he had the night(s) prior\n\nNormally don\u2019t mix work and play myself", "Can\u2019t say Ive always say I\u2019ve had the same benefit. Have seen drivers turned around for smelling like a brewery while hung over or even sober\n\nPersonally would use those examples as reasons to not over drink knowing I gotta work next day. Protects my job and more importantly, my license", "How many people in your bed rn?", "And that partnership thing cuts both ways no? You don\u2019t get shitfaced and make your partner work when you know she really needs a day off. \n\nNTA. Don\u2019t cover for his drinking.", "I never said they should, I\u2019m just saying I would personally do it for someone I love regardless of whether it\u2019s self induced or not. I\u2019d also need more info regarding whether this has happened previously or if it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s asked you to cover him for being hungover. If it\u2019s not a habit, then I\u2019d definitely cover it for my partner. But again, I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s an AH bc she doesn\u2019t want to either.", "To be fair not enough info here. I've had hangovers come out of nowhere after a moderate night drinking and then been completely wasted and not have any issues the next day. It's a combo of hydration and vitamins lost from processing alcohol. Sometimes it just hits differently. If this is a habit or he made a point to drink so much there is no way you couldn't be hung over that's a tad different.", "I\u2019ve become horrendously hungover for no reason before. Maybe he\u2019s getting sick, maybe he drank something that particularly didn\u2019t agree with him. \n\nWe can\u2019t speak to that.", "\ud83e\udd13\u261d\ufe0f moment\n\n\nThis thread is just absurd. It\u2019s not that hard. Cover the shift, he\u2019s your boyfriend. Unless it\u2019s a recurrent thing, absolutely YTA.", "Lol ok bud. He can fucking work, myself as well as many in this thread have worked hungover. It\u2019s his own damn fault.", "all over the place lmao", "and it should be the manager's responsibility to find a replacement or deal with the extra work themself", "You can't go to a restaurant while being sick. Health and safety.\nTheir \"plans\" are ply with puppy and do cleaning. Those are not plans. \nOp is being selfish. Either you are in a partnership or you are not. If you just want to care about you, your wants and needs, then don't be in a relationship.", "And an alcoholic", "When I worked at Starbucks, the manager threatened to write me up for calling out sick too much with morning sickness. I pulled out the phrase \"pregnancy is considered a temporary disability\" and that conversation ended real quick. But it annoys me that I even had to go there.", "Thank god this example where we\u2019re being asked to give our opinion is in food service", "And you are perfect and NEVER made a stupid choice, had a lack of judgement? Those who live in glass houses ...\nThis is clearly an exception not a regular occurrence. It happens. I have been drunk twice in my life. Both times I was ill. Once was on purpose. But the other time, I find realise I was even near to drunk. I had been sitting in a comfy chair chatting away with my best friend and felt perfectly fine. No signs what so ever. I then get up to go yo the loo and it hit me. I went straight from fine (not even feeling \"happy\") to being sick multiple times and feeling awful. I had drunk more than I usual do but I find think it was that extrem. So yeah who knows why he got so drunk. And even if it was deliberate, you cover then you make him sleep on the sofa for a week and make him regret it. You don't put in danger his income and therefore your means.", "Exactly. I think many of these people live underground without human contact. If it's a one off and doesn't ever happen, great, cover it, unless you had some huge plans maybe.\n\nIf the person was non-hungover ill, they could easily call in to their place of work and say they can't come in due to sickness. A hangover excuse is an embarassing thing and many people don't want to admit it. This is one way trying to get around it.", "If he thinks he may have been spiked surely he would be more concerned by calling for medical advice, rather than getting someone to cover his shift? \n\nMost common date rape drugs wipe your memory and are muscle relaxants, plus you are usually very, very groggy afterwards as one \"dose\" can last 8-12 hours.  Obviously could be spiked by other substances but a relaxing memory erasing sedative is usually used. IMO as someone who has been spiked and someone who has been hungover, if you're a regular drinker, you will know the difference.", "If you work in food after vomiting, yta", "Sounds like OP\u2019s boyfriend was the selfish one, drinking to excess the night before he knew he had to work.", "I get that employees are technically required to find their own replacement, but this is absolutely not on the gf for not wanting to go in on her day off. The people in charge need to hire enough people so that if one dude is sick, they aren't so desperately lacking workers.", "Their \"plans\" are ply with puppy and do cleaning. Those are not plans. \n\n\nThose are her plans, no one gets to tell her what are plans and what aren\u2019t. OP is on her days off, meaning that is her time. \n\nThe BF chose to get so drunk he is sick and now wants her to cover for him. He knew he had to work but still did it- he\u2019s the selfish one.", "hangovers aren't a temporary disability though, yeah he shouldn't go in but he has to follow the consequences of his actions.", "Are you perfect? Have you never made a stupid decision? Have you never had a lack of judgement? It happens. You punish him but you cover for him.", "You can't change how many people they hire. It doesn't matter if their boss is a cheap b who doesn't hire enough staff. That is out of op or ops bf power. You can only deal with the actual situation. That situation being that he is being sick. He can't work. He has asked everyone else and she could easily take his shift. That is the reality.", "Oh no I agree completely. Sucks to suck on that one", "Uhhh yeah, the consequence is he has to call out. The end\n\nHe shouldnt have to go in if hes puking"]}
