You made a deal. Honor it.\n\nPart of the deal was you selling him the console for a bargain price- I would consider that his \"interest\" or \"origination fee\" on the loan.

And YTA for refusing to pay back a debt unless your demands are met. That's just not how this works. \n\nSecond, your friend also kind of sucks for exploiting this situation. He should have offered to knock more than $50 off your debt in exchange for the PS5, or he should have understood that you gave him a good deal as a gesture of gratitude and held onto the PS5 for his own enjoyment. But again, you *agreed* to the terms here. \n\nYou didn't *have* to give your friend a PS5 in exchange for knocking only $50 off your debt-- you could have just paid him back $100/month like you originally said you would.

And once you decided to effectively sell it to your friend for $50, he was totally within his rights to do whatever he wanted with the console. He didn't *agree* not to sell it. You just *assumed* that he wouldn't do that. \n\nI hope you learn from this situation! Borrowing/lending money can really screw up relationships-- it can lead to a lot of resentment and misunderstandings. But when you make an agreement, you have an obligation to uphold your end of the bargain. That's why it's really important to think everything through in advance.

You made a poor financial decision and sound extremely naive. In all technicality, you made a deal and you should honor it because that's just the way life works. You can't just go back on your deals and promises just because you decide later down the line that you either don't think it's a fair deal anymore or that you're angry at the person so you are no longer accountable for your deal. Getting emotional or having a falling out with someone is NOT an excuse to go back on a deal, especially one where someone has loaned you money they didn't have to loan you in the first place. There should be some level of gratefulness there, to at least motivate you to keep to the deal, even if your friendship doesn't continue beyond that.\n\nIf everybody sucks IS an option, then everybody sucks. I already explain what I think about your side, but your friend sounds like a friend I wouldn't keep around. While they aren't technically or legally wrong, what they did wasn't very friend-like. If my friend was making a poor financial decision, even if that decision would benefit me, I would NEVER take advantage of my friend that way, rather I would point out why what they're doing isn't the best option for them. When you're someone's friend, it's never okay to seize an opportunity at their expense. You should be able to trust that your FRIENDS are making deals with you in good faith. This would destroy my trust in this friend.

OP technically owes the remainder of the money, but the friend can\u2019t reasonably expect OP will still want to be friends with him after pulling that stunt.", "Either way, we see now how OP\u2019s poor financial decisions have led to or are keeping them broke.\n\nWhile OP seems to be a little naive, their heart was in the right place with the mistake.", "Yeah I kinda view the selling of the PS5 and the loaning of the money as separate transactions. Not saying the PS5 was a favor but I personally feel it's worth an eye narrow that the friend just really really wanted a PS5 until he had one for a good deal.

He made a deal and sold the ps5 for $50. That\u2019s the amount credited to the debt. What if his friend sold it the day after OP paid him the whole $650. It\u2019s the same thing. What his friend sold it for has no legal standing. Is it a shit thing for a \u201cfriend\u201d to do. Maybe. But it doesn\u2019t matter.

Sorry but YTA. I mean kind of ESH but either way you gotta own up. You made a mistake, he took advantage of you, and you still owe him money. It would've been a different story if you had made up some sort of agreement ahead of time but you made your financial decision and he made his. You have every right to feel betrayed, disappointed, even angry, but you don't get to decide that the money he got for what was at the time his own possession should go toward your debt.", "YTA. \n\nYou are right though.  You should have sold the PS5 for its market value and used that to pay the debt to your friend.\n\nCorrection:  You should have sold the PS5 before you borrowed money from your friend so you would owe him less from the beginning.\n\nEven better idea:  Don't purchase expensive gaming systems when money is tight and you'll have the cash when you need it without having to hit up your friends for money.\n\nBottom line, you owe him the money back.  Pay him back.  It's not YOUR PS5 anymore, so you have no say in what he does with it.

It was your choice to offer it up for such a low amount. You don't have the right to dictate what he does with it, after that. He was right, he owned it, and he had every right to do as he pleased with it. And to hold your debt over his head because of it?! This is immature, entitled behavior! Get over yourself, and pay the man back!", "YTA. You should have sold it yourself to pay towards your debt to him. It was your decision to sell it to him for $50, what he did with it afterwards is his business. There was no agreement to reduce the debt you owe based on how much he would sell it for. You shot yourself in the foot here. \n\nI'm still on the fence about putting him as well in the AH category. On the one hand, it looks like he took advantage of you by taking the ps5 for $50 but on the other hand, you chose to sell it to him and he bought it from you fair and square.", "Yta. \n\nYou made a stupid choice and it's your own fault. \n\nIt's shitty your friend did that but you knew it was worth more you should have immediately  offered it to him for reduced debt more than 50. \n\nOnce you decided to give it to him for 50 it was his to do what ever he wants with it.", "YTA.

You were pretty naieve about selling your console for so little. I don't mean to belittle your situation but I have to assume you're a minor based on the fact that you obviously didn't purchase the console yourself but felt comfortable selling it's for only 50 dollars.
