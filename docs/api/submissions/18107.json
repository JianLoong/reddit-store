You made a deal. Honor it.\n\nPart of the deal was you selling him the console for a bargain price- I would consider that his \"interest\" or \"origination fee\" on the loan.

And YTA for refusing to pay back a debt unless your demands are met. That's just not how this works. \n\nSecond, your friend also kind of sucks for exploiting this situation. He should have offered to knock more than $50 off your debt in exchange for the PS5, or he should have understood that you gave him a good deal as a gesture of gratitude and held onto the PS5 for his own enjoyment. But again, you *agreed* to the terms here. \n\nYou didn't *have* to give your friend a PS5 in exchange for knocking only $50 off your debt-- you could have just paid him back $100/month like you originally said you would.

And once you decided to effectively sell it to your friend for $50, he was totally within his rights to do whatever he wanted with the console. He didn't *agree* not to sell it. You just *assumed* that he wouldn't do that. \n\nI hope you learn from this situation! Borrowing/lending money can really screw up relationships-- it can lead to a lot of resentment and misunderstandings. But when you make an agreement, you have an obligation to uphold your end of the bargain. That's why it's really important to think everything through in advance.

You made a poor financial decision and sound extremely naive. In all technicality, you made a deal and you should honor it because that's just the way life works. You can't just go back on your deals and promises just because you decide later down the line that you either don't think it's a fair deal anymore or that you're angry at the person so you are no longer accountable for your deal. Getting emotional or having a falling out with someone is NOT an excuse to go back on a deal, especially one where someone has loaned you money they didn't have to loan you in the first place. There should be some level of gratefulness there, to at least motivate you to keep to the deal, even if your friendship doesn't continue beyond that.\n\nIf everybody sucks IS an option, then everybody sucks. I already explain what I think about your side, but your friend sounds like a friend I wouldn't keep around. While they aren't technically or legally wrong, what they did wasn't very friend-like. If my friend was making a poor financial decision, even if that decision would benefit me, I would NEVER take advantage of my friend that way, rather I would point out why what they're doing isn't the best option for them. When you're someone's friend, it's never okay to seize an opportunity at their expense. You should be able to trust that your FRIENDS are making deals with you in good faith. This would destroy my trust in this friend.

He should still be happy with that and I hope that you take a lesson and don\u2019t take on loans with such terrible terms in the future.", "Pay the remaining balance of the $700 minus the $50 and write it down as a cheap lesson in life.   \nDon\u2019t a lender or borrower Be.", "So why didn't you sell it & pay down your debt?", "\u201cI\u2019ll never let you lend me money again\u201d \n\u201cUhhhh..thanks?\u201d", "The PS5 was the favour (I\u2019m assuming)", "I'm not saying the PS5 was a favor I'm just saying if it bothers OP so much he should simply decide to not do favors in the future instead of trying to change the terms of their agreement.", "Your emotions aside, it\u2019s not bullshit.  The debt is repaid.  The friend has $700 in his pocket.", "No. The debt is paid. As a result of things that came from me and which he didn\u2019t earn, he has $700.  Plus close to $50 extra, depending on how much effort went into selling it.", "It was a shitty thing to do, but that doesn\u2019t justify OP refusing to pay back money that they borrowed.", "Exactly. OP technically owes the remainder of the money, but the friend can\u2019t reasonably expect OP will still want to be friends with him after pulling that stunt.", "Either way, we see now how OP\u2019s poor financial decisions have led to or are keeping them broke.\n\nWhile OP seems to be a little naive, their heart was in the right place with the mistake.", "Yeah I kinda view the selling of the PS5 and the loaning of the money as separate transactions. Not saying the PS5 was a favor but I personally feel it's worth an eye narrow that the friend just really really wanted a PS5 until he had one for a good deal. If it hurts OP so much he should just pay up and *not do any favors in the future* vs trying this.", "Try that one in court and see how well it holds up. OP was dumb. He made a deal and sold the ps5 for $50. That\u2019s the amount credited to the debt. What if his friend sold it the day after OP paid him the whole $650. It\u2019s the same thing. What his friend sold it for has no legal standing. Is it a shit thing for a \u201cfriend\u201d to do. Maybe. But it doesn\u2019t matter. They had a deal before his friend loaned him the money and now OP wants to change the terms to favor himself.", "I agree, hence why I said ESH", "AITA isn\u2019t a legal forum. So, you could be right about the legal resolution. With that said, I\u2019m pretty sure Judge Judy would see it my way.  \n\nBut the question is \u201cis OP TA for using the PS5 as partial payment?\u201d\n\nIMO, he is not, not if he makes up the difference in cash+$50. \n\n\nHe got his money back with minimal effort.  You even acknowledge that with a friend it was kind of shitty. The friend knowingly allowed OP to devalue his item by 600%. So, the lack of a full cash payment balances that out. \n\nHonestly, that\u2019s not a friend.", "OK."]}
