You made a deal. Honor it.\n\nPart of the deal was you selling him the console for a bargain price- I would consider that his \"interest\" or \"origination fee\" on the loan.

And YTA for refusing to pay back a debt unless your demands are met. That's just not how this works. \n\nSecond, your friend also kind of sucks for exploiting this situation. He should have offered to knock more than $50 off your debt in exchange for the PS5, or he should have understood that you gave him a good deal as a gesture of gratitude and held onto the PS5 for his own enjoyment. But again, you *agreed* to the terms here. \n\nYou didn't *have* to give your friend a PS5 in exchange for knocking only $50 off your debt-- you could have just paid him back $100/month like you originally said you would.

And once you decided to effectively sell it to your friend for $50, he was totally within his rights to do whatever he wanted with the console. He didn't *agree* not to sell it. You just *assumed* that he wouldn't do that. \n\nI hope you learn from this situation! Borrowing/lending money can really screw up relationships-- it can lead to a lot of resentment and misunderstandings. But when you make an agreement, you have an obligation to uphold your end of the bargain. That's why it's really important to think everything through in advance.

You made a poor financial decision and sound extremely naive. In all technicality, you made a deal and you should honor it because that's just the way life works. You can't just go back on your deals and promises just because you decide later down the line that you either don't think it's a fair deal anymore or that you're angry at the person so you are no longer accountable for your deal. Getting emotional or having a falling out with someone is NOT an excuse to go back on a deal, especially one where someone has loaned you money they didn't have to loan you in the first place. There should be some level of gratefulness there, to at least motivate you to keep to the deal, even if your friendship doesn't continue beyond that.\n\nIf everybody sucks IS an option, then everybody sucks. I already explain what I think about your side, but your friend sounds like a friend I wouldn't keep around. While they aren't technically or legally wrong, what they did wasn't very friend-like. If my friend was making a poor financial decision, even if that decision would benefit me, I would NEVER take advantage of my friend that way, rather I would point out why what they're doing isn't the best option for them. When you're someone's friend, it's never okay to seize an opportunity at their expense. You should be able to trust that your FRIENDS are making deals with you in good faith. This would destroy my trust in this friend.

If you wanted to get more value from your PS5 to repay your debt you should have told that to your friend and agreed that x amount is considered repaid. By giving it to him for 50 dollars and telling him it's a huge bargain you are giving him a gift, you don't actually connect it to the loan. Ofc your friend is  a prick and shoud have maybe understood your intentions, but it's not a given, and when money is concerned all of us need to communicate precisely and to the point. You were the one who was not precise at all! Friend is AH for exploiting you though, by saying he wanted the PS5, getting it from you practically free while he knew that you are grateful for him giving you a loan, and then just reselling it for profit. \n\nFinally, if you have issues with money you are not supposed to be gifting expensive stuff but selling them at the best possble price.

Morally, your friend is in the wrong, but technically he is right. You did sell him the console for a ridiculously low price and he was the new owner with the right to dispose of it as he pleases. My advice is, if you have a written agreement for the loan repayment, honour it and never speak to him again. If you don\u2019t have a written agreement, give him back the difference between the money he has received directly from you and indirectly from the sale of your console, and write off the friendship too.

Stop payments now over this fight when you still owe him is absolutely an AH move.\n\nI would lower your understanding of the outstanding debt to $250 ($700 - one $100 payment - the $350) and then continue to pay $100 for the next two months, and pay $50 the month after, then stop paying.
