That's bizarre.\n\nI'm going to say ESH because if you two were truly a team, she would have no problem trusting you to take the AWD during a freak snowstorm.

She also needs happy healthy loving parents who show that they respect and care about not only her but each other. That they respect each other. You're doin her a big disservice staying in your marriage. She's goin to think this is what love looks like when she's older and it's gunna set her up for some very unhealthy relationships. Do you want her to have her spuse treat her as your wife does you? You're teaching her more then you realize, everyday. You're mirroring her future. You're showing her what a marriage looks like. What love looks like. How spouses should treat each other. That it's ok to allow someone to stomp all over you and treat you like shiit cuz you have a child. I assure you those things last longer then a few hard months and years financially after a divorce.", "NTA but you need a divorce", "NTA for this at all. \n\nLooking at your other posts OP\u2026I think it\u2019s time to discuss divorce. This is totally an abusive and toxic relationship.", "I understand her phobia but seriously she needs to reevaluate herself!  She won\u2019t get to buy anything extra if you miss work. You are NTA. Neither is she, but she needs to start THINKING with her brain!", "NTA", "It's a bit late now but winter tyres on a 2WD car are far superior to AWD. Having all wheels driven doesn't help the brakes.\nYou're certainly NTA for asking, but you'll have to make do with her answer. She obviously has issues, with only her car being a satisfactory escape route, but I find it strange that some commentators think it's a breakup issue. All of us have flaws and while this is annoying and inconvenient for OP there's far more to a marriage.\nIf suitable, rather than focusing on solutions for her you could ask how she would feel if you got into a serious collision because you were in an unsafe car? Which would be the worse risk in her mind, not having her car or something happening to you?\nAny way, hope you have a safe journey to and from work.", "Yeah NTA. What exactly does your SAHW think will happen to her and your kids if you get in a crash with your car unsuited for the conditions, and get disabled or even killed?", "NTA your wife sounds selfish and unwilling to compromise! I doubt it's about the anxiety anymore, since she doesn't want to drive you to work either. If she has nowhere to go, if her parents live 5 min down the road, then surely she does not need her car, the 2wd will do.", "Jesus. from reading the comments you put down, Your wife needs help badly..\nLike yesterday, She has some Huge underligeing problems that she needs to work on.\nNTA\nYou should take the car, since you pay a big chunk for it, and she has help close by if needed, and another car..\nShe sounds like she's a bit crazy", "YTA, she has PTSD and should be seen for it. But until then you need to refrain from making it out to be her fault.", ">I'd walk in the snow to make sure my daughter (and her mother) had whatever they needed to be comfortable.\n\nHis job is 20 miles away.", "It\u2019s not that you won\u2019t debate, it\u2019s that you aren\u2019t making your point. Oh, and she also has relatives who live nearby and can help her. The wife is just selfish. If it were me I\u2019d want to know that my husband, who actually has to drive, can do so as safely as possible, especially since he\u2019s the sole breadwinner. If he has an accident then their whole family is in trouble.", "This dude's disgusting take on rideshare drivers is all you need to know about this AH.", "My parents divorced when I was 4 and my brother was 10. (dad was an alcoholic) \nWe grew up in [safe, white privilege] poverty because of it. I would absolutely choose that over growing up with more money but parents who didn't respect themselves or each other.\n\nI respect my mum, who we lived with, for working two jobs and raising two children, on 13k a year... And I respect my dad, who we stayed with every other weekend, for growing and becoming a better person.\n\nAt age 10, my brother had a tough time with the divorce. He saw them fight a lot, he saw her treated poorly. I didn't notice the separation much.\n\nYour relationship will not get better if she is unwilling to do anything to work on doing better.\n\nFrom the few comments I read, it doesn't sound like you are respected or valued. It sounds hard. And heavy. \n\nI'm not telling you to divorce her, but as someone going through a divorce with a spouse who also refused to work on anything - start documenting where you can. \n\nEmails, texts, journal stories like this - date them. Anything that shows you are trying to do better and she is not. If you don't always look good, record it anyway. Keep it safe and private. It could help later on.", "Based on post and your comments\u2026 NTA", "I'm not reading this, I will wait for a tiktok version. Because I'm too lazy", "What did I just read? You are NTA. Her \u2018trauma\u2019 doesn\u2019t override your safety and your job that helps pay your family\u2019s bills. You are supposed to be a team. It seems very strange that she is carrying this baggage all the way into your long term *marriage* if you\u2019ve not tried to run away with her car in a these years!", "NTA", "NTA, i get your point. But i mean dude, come on, learn how to drive. Tons of people live in arctic climates with icy hills and long roads but manage just fine with a 2WD", "NTA, what is with all these spouses refusing to help one another. Sad...", "I am gonna  disagree  Nah. \nUsually you are right but if she has a phobia  then it's  reasonable for the car to remain  home and she  is not an ah for saying so.", "I would probably even suggest it.", "It\u2019s because it appears like a lack of respect.  She doesn\u2019t need the car and would still have access to a vehicle.\n\nShe\u2019s just throwing a hissy fit because it isn\u2019t HER vehicle and she\u2019s using past trauma as an excuse for that.", "If someone has a phobia, they need to get therapy and work through it, not endanger their spouse's life.", "NTA then.  You offered that you could drive her car or she could drive you in so she'd have it available, plus it's all temporary and unplanned.  She can't decline both reasonable options.", "My friend, this is the 21st century- if you live in any kind of populous area there is a cab company and any number of services available to get you a ride places- and that\u2019s not even including friends or family.\n\nThere is no excuse to be afraid of not having a car- plenty of people live that way and get along just fine.", "Because you justified your Judgement with a suggestion of what he allready is doing.", "Providing for a child\u2019s physical needs isn\u2019t where parenting ends.

Enjoy your daughter\u2019s childhood and raise her to be the great person you know she can be.", "Your daughter won't thank you for modeling unhappy, unhealthy relationships that inspire her to hook up with an abusive asshole because she never saw healthy, respectful relationships at home.  Better to have very tight budgets."]}
