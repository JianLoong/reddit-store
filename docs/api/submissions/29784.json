{"id": 29784, "submission_id": "17hs67z", "title": "AITAH for getting snippy with my neighbor", "selftext": "My wife and I moved in to our townhouse 5 years ago. As soon as we did, our next door neighbor introduced herself and gave us information on everyone in the neighborhood that we neither asked for or wanted. She is definitely one of those nosy neighbors who looks through the back fence, we've caught her, and talks about everyone! I tend to be friendly but keep to myself. While I like to be aware, I don't need to be in everyone's business so I would cut her off when she began gossiping. My wife isn't a gossip either, but has a more difficult time shutting people down. And to avoid any assumptions, we're both women. \n\nOver the years this neighbor has started small confrontations with me because I'm \"short\" or \"snippy\" with her. She'll want to talk to me through our shared fence, but I work from home and can't just sit and chit chat all day. Plus, that's just so creepy to me! She even accused our dog of being scary one day, then tried to love on her the next. She's also made some pretty racist comments about workers in the neighborhood who \"don't speak English\" or Black neighbors who \"have all those cars\". She even tried to accuse a Black family of throwing paint at an elderly woman's car. It was bird poop!\n\nCut to this week. Her landlord had been in contact with us regarding our shared fence because he was replacing his fence and needed our permission to remove and replace the portion we share. We settled everything with him and the workers came today while my wife was out and I was working from home. I get a knock on my door and it's her telling me she stopped the crew from touching our fence because the crew that doesn't speak English was going to tear it down. I was confused because that was the reason we were involved in the process at all. She proceeded to tell me FOUR more times the crew did not speak English. I asked what her landlord told her and she said no one tells her anything, but she knew we had been notified about the work. I then asked if she has google translate on her phone or can call her landlord. I had not been in direct contact with her landlord, but my wife and I discussed it and it was my understanding the shared fence was being replaced. I was short with her because she was being so rude and I had no idea what she was doing at my door in the first place. 15 minutes later the men were taking down the shared fence and she was standing at my back gate overseeing the men!!!\n\nWhen my wife came home, the neighbor came outside to complain about me being mean as if my wife would side with her. This caused my wife to yell at her to leave me alone and I burst into tears in the house. I feel trapped, but wonder if I should have just coddled this adult woman!

Nosy neighbors are the *worst.* You have no obligation to chat with her and she's the one crossing a boundary.", "NTA, but your neighbor is. How dare she oversee the work her landlord arranged and stop the crew from doing something the landlord paid for. She is a tenant, not an owner. Get in touch with the landlord and let him know that she's interfering with the work he/she discussed with you. Also, keep a bucket of seaweed and water in the pack yard. When she's standing at the fence listening, open the bucket and use the lid to waft the smell towards where she is. As I understand it, the smell is horrendous until it's fully fermented. It will have her running back into her house to avoid it. If she is at your back gate, and that likely means she's on your property, discreetly hit her toes with a squirt gun loaded with the same seaweed fermenting water. This same water will make an excellent organic fertilizer when it's finished fermenting, and the smell will be barely noticeable or gone when complete (depending on how sensitive you and your wife's noses are).\n\nYou can look up the bucket woman stories on here if you like. The woman dealing with a similar neighbor has some great ideas, and they are quite a humorous read, if you need some cheering up.", "NTA. Do not give in to her childish behavior and coddle her. It will just encourage her to keep going. Be firm, set boundaries, and tell her off when she crosses them.", "NTA! I can't stand people who insert themselves into your private time and space. Go away! I indulged my obnoxious thru-the-fence neighbor for 3 years, giving \"short\" answers and subtle hints at first, then literally telling him how I really need my privacy and space. One day I finally had to actually yell at him WILL YOU GO THE FUCK AWAY and he just stared and went \"are you talking to me?\" Thankfully, he has left me alone since then.
