I got sick of it, and told our dad who had an idea.\n\nIt turns out he has a mutual friend of my brothers drill instructors, and passed a message along that my brother hasn't been enjoying boot canp. The instructors were happy to give him a unique experience. He hasn't gotten a warm shower or a full meal since, plus he tells me they keep dumping out his canteen, then smoking him for drinking all of it.\n\nWell my dad let slip that I was the one who came up with the idea, and my brother lost it. He said I was giving him shit for no reason, and called me a snitch. But he's in the army, and he won't make it if he cries about every little hardship. My mother also thinks what I did was harsh, but she's never served and she babies him, so she would say that.", "created_utc": 1679329702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wnho3/aita_for_making_my_brothers_life_at_boot_camp/", "score": 742, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you want to do this to him?  His whining might have been annoying to you, but boot camp is a difficult thing and each person has their own level of difficulty.  It may have been easy for you, you may have made friends etc and that helps, but we had a girl who tried to hurt herself because it was too much for her.  You are not his judge, jury and executioner.  YTA big time.", "YTA. He\u2019s going to have things rough enough without his own family making it more difficult rather than encouraging and supporting him. \n\nBut, hey, congrats on doing potentially irreversible damage to your relationship with your brother and even maybe your dad\u2019s relationship with him.", "YTA. This is coming from a person who served. Don\u2019t make his experience harder than it needs to be. He\u2019s allowed to express his feelings.", "YTA\n\nYour brother confided in you because he trusts and loves you, and you paid him back my exponentially increasing his hardship.\n\nMaybe in your mind toughening up your brother is worth making him despise you, but I think you've hurt him more than you realize.", "YTA. He wasn't complaining to anyone involved. He was complaining to his family, who've been through similar things and maybe could have offered a word of support. Y'all went out of your way to make things harder on him.... like for fun? \n\nAt least now he knows not to trust you or your dad.", "YTA and a bully", "Wait until your Army brother comes home from boot camp and takes it out on your little navy self.", "Who needs enemies when family like you exists. \n\nYTA", "What a nice way to advertise how awful you are as a human.

Boot camp is a hard enough adjustment to make without piling on extra \u201cattention\u201d from the drill instructor. You knew what would happen when you shared a private family conversation with your brother\u2019s instructor. I think you wanted to make it as hard as possible for him. You need to grow up.", "YTA, you and everyone involved sound like bullies. You and the other men involved are teaching your brother that no one is trustworthy and no one has his back.

You know the saying a few bad apples spoil the bushel, you're the bad apples that give the military a bad rap.", "YTA.\n\nBoth you, your father and the instructors.\n\n\nYour brother had hard time time with the boot camp and instead of giving him encouraging words you decided that it's best to make his life miserable and have others harass him.\n\n\nIf you want him to learn respect or something by doing that, you are a complete fool. All that bullying only taught him that he cannot trust you or your father, and that the instructors won't have his back.\n\n\nSo yeah, YTA and a huge one.

Perhaps you had some jealousy towards him and acted that way because of it.", "Yta\u2026what\u2019s wrong with you?  Your making you brothers life hell because he complained.

I come from a military family, too, and you, your father, and the DI seem to have missed a really important part of basic: everyone goes through the same experience , fairly, so in the process of doing so it breaks them down psychologically, BUILDS THEM BACK UP, and then bonds everyone together. If one servicemember is getting it worse than everyone else, that undermines the process. Plus, COs are NOT supposed to f*** with hydration. Ever. Part of their job is making sure all their subordinates are properly hydrated. (My dad talked about this to a ridiculous extent, so I learned far more about hydration than someone outside healthcare really needs to know. \ud83d\ude04 He would tell his people what their pee should look like and said if it wasn't almost clear, they had to drink more water.

No way.\n\nYTA", "YTA just because you are \"tough\" enough to handle those boot camps, doesn't give you the right to bully your brother.

He was complaining about something being difficult, why is that bad? Was he telling you he was going to quit? He was venting to someone he thought he could trust. And instead of supporting him, telling him it would be ok, that he'll make it through it, or anything at all supportive, his family went to extra effort to make it harder instead. His own family actively tried to wake it worse because he dared to look to his own brother for moral support.

Do you want him to be miserable? I can't understand the rationale behind the actions of you or your father except you hate your brother. He didn't even complain to anyone in his chain of command, he simply *vented to his brother* who he probably thought would understand.\n\nI feel like this is a really good example of toxic masculinity.

Your family should be a support system. Instead it\u2019s a high school boys locker room, and you\u2019re teaching him you haven\u2019t the ability to be confidential, and you have no desire to be a venting post or someone he can turn to, when things are rough.  You can keep playing the big-dick game, but eventually you can expect life to get lonely.", "YTA.  He's your brother.  He shouldn't go around whining at boot camp, but he can't even complain in private to his own family?  So freaking toxic.

Even IF they didn\u2019t smoke him for this\u2026. This is his CAREER. You wouldn\u2019t call professors at a college because he was complaining would you?

I sincerely hope he'll return the favor once he comes home.", "YTA and your dad too, it's a toxic attitude. \n\nThat's how you treat your family when they try to vent to you? You do realize you destroyed your relationship with him while prior to this he confided in you. You are in fact the definition of a snitch.\n\nIn the end you probably did him a favor since I expect he won't confide in the tool bag that you identify as his brother.", "Yta, so instead of being supportive and telling them that they could do it, you decided to make sure to make their life even harder than it needed to be, cause you seem to want to see people suffer.", "YTA.

But you\u2019ve intentionally made it to he is singled out, and treated significantly worse than everyone else there, because he was honest and said it sucks. Everyone knows it sucks. And it\u2019s ridiculous to punish someone for saying it. \n\nFrankly, you seem like a fucking asshole, and you seem to think him admitting it sucks means he\u2019s less of a person.

My brother decided to join the army this year at 18, and apparently didn't expect boot camp to be hard. Every time he calls he's moaning about how hard the drills are, how getting up early sucks, and basic crap like that. I got sick of it, and told our dad who had an idea.\n\nIt turns out he has a mutual friend of my brothers drill instructors, and passed a message along that my brother hasn't been enjoying boot canp. The instructors were happy to give him a unique experience. He hasn't gotten a warm shower or a full meal since, plus he tells me they keep dumping out his canteen, then smoking him for drinking all of it.\n\nWell my dad let slip that I was the one who came up with the idea, and my brother lost it. He said I was giving him shit for no reason, and called me a snitch. But he's in the army, and he won't make it if he cries about every little hardship. My mother also thinks what I did was harsh, but she's never served and she babies him, so she would say that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
