I didn\u2019t want to right away but wanted to later down the road. When we met I was 18 and just starting to pursue a career in music and he was working an entry level construction job. While we were dating he became a realtor and I told him I wanted to move to LA to pursue my songwriting dreams.\n\nFast forward to now, we moved to LA and have a 2 year old. He made 2 commissions last year, one in January and one in May. He continues to work in real estate and does uber on the side to bring in more money. Most months he doesn\u2019t bring in enough to pay rent though. Our expenses are $9k a month, due to childcare, lots of debt, and HCOL area. \n\nI end up picking up the slack I teach 30 piano students and gig 2-3 times on the weekends. I had a song go viral and start earning us $200 a month and I want to make more songs and really give my dream a go but I can\u2019t because I\u2019m just fighting to pay bills every month. He constantly whines about living in an apartment and not a house which puts so much pressure on me. \n\nLast night I broke down in tears. I told him if he was a single dad he would\u2019ve found a way to bring in enough to pay rent and groceries and everything. I told him I want to be a stay at home mom someday and it looks like that I will have to work like a dog for the rest of my life. He says that I am being hurtful and I should be encouraging him. He also says it\u2019s my fault that we moved to a HCOL area where he didn\u2019t know anyone (he made more sales in our previous state)\n\nHe says telling him he\u2019s not a provider is really mean but I tell him I\u2019m just saying the truth! I really need help and I\u2019m burnt out and can\u2019t keep shouldering the burden alone.\n\nHe has 2 listings and 2 buyers at the moment. Both listings are a little sketchy and could fall through. There\u2019s never a guarantee of a paycheck and it\u2019s driving me insane. I told him we could give it until June but if he doesn\u2019t make at least $4k a month he needs to find a different career.\n\nAm I the A-hole?\n\nEDIT: I steadily bring in $8k a month from my music. He steadily brings in about $1-2k. We also have real estate investments that bring us in $1,200 a month so we are financially stable it just mostly relies on me working a ton.\n\nEDIT 2: Since everyone\u2019s saying I\u2019m the AH, I appreciate the perspective and it is helping me see things differently. What would you suggest I do? How long should I be okay supporting both of us? I also want to mention that I work like 60* hours a week. I just need to slow down at some point.\n\nEDIT 3: I just want to mention in our previous state, I was still the breadwinner. It wasn\u2019t like he had a booming career that he could go back to easily. It was still a struggle and I carried us there too. Moving back we\u2019d still be in the same situation.", "created_utc": 1674167962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gfl9z/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_isnt_providing_for/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You knew he was a realtor. You wanted to move to high cost of living area. And that made him start over. \n\nTo recap: life happens. You directly are responsible for most of your current situation.

These are not the same thing.\n\nIf you want to be a SAHM, then move back where you came from, where your husband's real estate career was going better.  He has two jobs, it's not like he's not trying.

With the market turning, it's better to go where he's had more success and the COL is lower.\n\nIf you want to be a successful musician, then stay where you are but be willing to work your tail off for it. This is going to be hard to do and there is no guarantee of success (in fact, there is like a 99% guarantee of failure).
