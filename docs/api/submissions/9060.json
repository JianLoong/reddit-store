You were mad the kid was being a brat and wasn\u2019t being a good sport so you\u2026.became an even worse sport and an even bigger brat? WTF, man, who does this?\n\nYes, of course YTA.", "ESH. Your nephew for the lack of manners. But you are the biggest asshole here. You decided to keep playing after having long proven your point. If you would have stopped when he threw the console you would have been teaching him a lesson. But you had to make the kid play even though he wanted to stop and was crying and this while yelling loudly \"Goaal\". The only thing he, maybe, learned is that people suck.", "No lessons were learned by OP or the Nephew in the making of this post YTA", "YTA There\u2019s a lesson for him to learn here about humility and taking defeat- but this wasn\u2019t the way to teach him at all. Come on, you\u2019re 31, no need to stoop to the level of a 12 year old and yell in his face. You\u2019re the adult here, act like one.", "Yikes. Lol. YTA because he's 8. He was just speaking like an 8 year old would, and playing video games like an 8 year old would. You don't have to let him win, but if he's crying, what's  the point of even playing? You were just being obnoxious right back...into his crying face no less. Yooo....did you think he ran upstairs crying thinking, \"wow my uncle really taught me a lesson!\" You have to communicate to teach a lesson. He's 8, so that's especially true.", "YTA, you took it WAY too far!", "Yta when an 8yo acts like that, you turn off the game ans say 'I'm not going to lay anymore with you because you are acting like that. Purpofully injuring my players isn't funny, it's obnoxious'", "Yta. I think at the point the controller got thrown the talk about being humble should happen and the game end.", "Um, well, you kind of overdid it\u2026didn\u2019t teach him much about sportsmanship either\u2026", "YTA. you made him cry, you went to far, he is a child. the point the controller was thrown is when you should have had a conversation about humility with him.", "YTA but thank you for the laugh! The image of you beating him down systematically would be amusing in a movie but is probably not going to help your relationships with your family. Generally you should try to lower your skill level to barely win or barely lose with small kids. Losing would make him feel good but winning slightly would have actually taught the lesson you say you intended to but clearly didn't while also not getting you in hot water. Continuing after his tantrum was also a wrong move; that was when any talk should have happened.", "INFO: do you feel good about the interaction? Do you think that making your nephew cry has produced a net positive?", "YTA. That was a kid being a kid, and you are a sore winner. If he was 15-16 it\u2019s still a little much. Hell if one of my friends pulled some shit like that on me I would unplug the console. Grow up before having kids of your own if that\u2019s part of your plan.", "YTA, I get scoring a few goals and winning since he\u2019s bragging, but 12-0, and yelling in his face? He\u2019s 8 \u2014 kids are obnoxious, but being his uncle, you\u2019re supposed to be the bigger man.", "YTA. You're a married ADULT and he's in 3rd grade.  Dude, grow up.", "YTA.  You're just teaching your nephew how to be a sore winner.  You honestly shouldn't have played in the first place if you weren't in the mood, but as soon as he was being obnoxious you should have just stopped playing.", "I can see scoring a few goals to get him to quit being obnoxious, but forcing him to keep playing and screaming in his face is bullying. YTA, you took it way too far. He\u2019s 8\u2026", "Yeah, YTA. He's a little kid. You definitely shouldn't have forced him to continue the game just so you could be more of an ass.\n\nYou didn't teach him a lesson about being humble, you taught him to be a braggard and an AH. Well done.", "YTA. 4 goals in was the point to call it and maybe offer another game with you both on the same team so there were no hard feelings.", "Either way I respect it", "NTA, bury the kid and assert dominance.", "He's 8! Go easy on him!  \nYTA!", "YTA", "YTA You should have modeled good sportsmanship if you wanted the kid to learn good sportsmanship.", "YTA, particularly for the way you began to behave when he was clearly upset. He displayed very poor manners, but he's a child. You took what could have been a teaching opportunity and turned it into a hurtful one. The better way to handle that would have been to stop playing when he was tackling players, telling him that you don't play with people who act that way. Instead, you took his behavior, ramped it up, and in the process, damaged your relationship with your nephew.", "YTA, its a video game and you took it way too far!", "YTA. You are an adult and he is a child. He has an excuse for acting like a child. You don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t like how he is playing, stop playing with him.", "YTA!u\n\nYou rubbed in your nephews face that he lost and you won! What poor sportsmanship, you absolute jerk!\n\nI won\u2019t even be good enough at the FIFA video game so if I win I would say, \u201cHow did that happen? Another round?\u201d\n\nBut if I was in your shoes I would have said, \u201cGood game. Round two? Or different game?\u201d", "YTA. I\u2019m 24 and whenever I play with young kids I let them win most of the matches and laugh off their little taunts and even toss some back (appropriately) it can be a lot of fun.. when you\u2019re not an asshole. It astounds me to see the levels of immaturity in people so much older than me. Grow up.", "YTA - He is EIGHT and you, a 31yo, bullied him by scoring 12 points and yelling GOAL in his face.  How are YOU NOT the biggest AH here?  \n\nYou beat an 8yo, did that make you feel like a man?", "YTA. Oh, yeah. He was being a kid. You're the adult. He looked up to you and made playing with you important to him, and you threw his childishness back in his face.\n\nA different uncle in a parallel universe taught him some tricks once he was winning by 3 goals. The uncle always gets asked back and is treated like a demi-god. That one laughs off the fouls and the obnoxious stuff and repays it with kindness. \n\nI don't wanna be too judgmental, but consider where you could take your current situation if you applied the same kind of kindness and understanding.", "ESH. He was obnoxious, but you as an adult you should know better.\n\nNext time he can play as Brazil and you can be Germany.", "What kind of 31 year old bullies an 8 year old?\nYta\nYou\u2019re a loser for that", "nta dude's prolly an only child. They need to learn somehow", "NTA to the victor go the spoils!", "Nta. Even kids can fuck around and find out.", "YTA.  The kid's 8 ffs.", "YTA, dude he\u2019s 8 and you were a bully. how was being a bully to a child supposed to help in any way? You could have taught him sportsmanship like how to win and lose gracefully, instead you were a bully and made him cry.", "LMAO, NTA , what did ur brother say?", "NTA.
