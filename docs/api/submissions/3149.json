You have every right to be mad at him for invading your privacy multiple times. He can't just snoop around your room and then demand a talk with you because he found your toys", "NTA. He is not the morality police and has no business talking to you about this. So inappropriate and I don\u2019t think you were too harsh, he needs to grow up.", "NTA.  He doesn't get to police your vagina.  Definitely get a lock.", "Edited because I thought it was a shared bathroom and it isn't.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "lock your doors get a camera and move out asap", "NTA. It's time to start locking the doors when you're not home.", "NTA, at all. He never should have been in your room or bathroom without permission or an emergency, which she should have told you about as soon as he could.

He knew I had toys and we've always been open about our sex lives, especially since we've been friends for so long, we literally went through puberty at the same time. It was never a taboo topic.", "Thank you! It's just weird, we're both open about our sex lives so it's not like it would be a surprise to him that I have toys because he was aware I had some. Maybe the amount? Even then, I'm angry regardless.", "Yes he definitely went too far with the snooping! Saying he was a little uncomfortable with 1 toy in your shared bathroom is one thing. But he admitted to snooping around your room when you\u2019re not there!!??", "Oh my God, I want to do this now.", "I get needing toilet paper and if it was strictly for toilet paper, I'd forgive it but yeah. Agree", "I don't even know if I want to move out. Other than this he's the perfect roommate and we've been best friends for years. This is the only issue we've ever really had.

Me and my penis are right here, ready and willing!  I know, I'll make her feel really dirty for servicing herself, and that will make her want me!\"", "Who said she left it in the shared bathroom, OP said she had her own bathroom", "If he's not super conservative religiously the only reason I can think of him acting like that about the sexuallity aspect would be if, in my mind, he's into you sexually in some manner.\n\nBeyond the speculation on that don't even get me started on dude going in your room and through your shit without your permission Jesus christ whT a creep. That's such am invasion of privacy. That's not even a red flag That's the factory they make the flags at.", "It definitely is weird. If he's your lifelong friend, no need to go scorched earth or move away. People here will recommend that because they want the world to burn. Just strongly reaffirm your boundaries when he is ready to talk to you again.", "He has literally no right to be upset about anything to do with your toys, let alone confront you", "It doesn't even sound like it's a shared bathroom! He went in there to get tp because he apparently ran out, so sounds like they have their own. So he had absolutely no right to be there much less to be snooping to the point that he found the other toys.", "You really should, it needs some tasteful lighting too. Really make the products stand out.", "He repeatedly snooped in your room and then gave you a lecture about your sex toys like he was a disappointed dad.\n\nNo clue why you\u2019d feel comfortable enough to stay after that.", "You're acting like he left a little bit of pasta sauce on the counter. He has been entering your private space, he steals from you, and he's slut shaming you for using sex toys and how you store them in your private space. He fundamentally does not respect you that's not a small issue", "You are not the one who should be moving out. He is.", "Is it possible he\u2019s into you? That\u2019s the only reason I can think of for him to freak out about some vibrators, especially since you\u2019re open about your sex lives and women owning sex toys is extremely common and everyone knows it. \n\nOh and, weird comment, but ask around. I too hoarded a few more expensive items that I didn\u2019t use but didn\u2019t want to throw away. Through organic conversation I found a few friends who weren\u2019t grossed out by the idea and were happy to take them off my hands.", "Put a deadbolt lock on your door, TODAY. Big NTA and WTF, is he in there smelling your dirty panties while you are gone? Be careful, he is perving on you big-time.", "I agree with u/ladidi10  AND this behavior is grounds for breaking a lease.  With two people on the lease, the landlord won\u2019t come after you unless the guy deadbeats. And you can get a lawyer to write a nasty letter for like $100 for something like this.  \n\nLocking your door is only a feel-good solution. Interior doors are not designed to be proof against any kind of abuse - if he escalates to something worse, he could go right through the door, so if I were you I would get out ASAP.", "Lol, great minds think alike!", "He's not religious but this isn't normal or usual behavior out of him. I don't know where this is coming from.", "OPs friend is clearly an asshole. But red flag of all red flags? Idk about that. These people have a long standing friendship. Why does this have to be all or nothing? I'm genuinely curious because this seems to be a popular way of thinking on this sub.", "If he's into you and the toys are bigger than him I can see where a 22yo would be young and insecure enough to feel threatened.", "That's part of the reason why I posted this situation. If I thought that there was no turning back, I'd have cut him off immediately but I wanted to see viewpoints. When he's cooled his jets and when I've cooled mine, I plan on having a long discussion with him.", "Sometimes it\u2019s the evil you know. Moving out could be expensive and she could end up with an even worse roommate. If they can resolve this issue, it could work out.", "I'm not comfortable with it but this has never been a problem. We went through puberty at the same time and sex was never a taboo subject.", "This is an issue that can definitely be reconciled, unless her roommate continues to break boundaries.", "Like I've said, there have never been problems other than this. I have noticed none of my items stolen or missing in all the time I've known him which means that if he took something for whatever reason, he did return it. This has never been an issue before. When we both cool off, I plan on speaking to him and if there's any significance, I will post an update. But until I talk to him, this is just a major f*ck up but can be moved past with proper boundary setting and a long conversation.", "I know but with both of us on the lease, I can't demand he leave. But also, this is the first time he has ever been an issue, we've never so much have had a fight. This is very out of character.", "That's smart. Of course if your friend continues to refuse to talk or compromise, that is a different problem.", "If he's not super conservative or religious, and you've been open about your sex lives/having toys, as well as being friends for a long time... is there a chance that he has feelings for you? He sounded even jealous?", "Sounds like you should start establishing a relationship with your landlord", "I agree. It sounds like he's upset that she's using toys instead of him. It honestly sounds a bit incel-like."]}
