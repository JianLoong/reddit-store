I washed them as an extra precaution just in case something was done to them like hot sauce being put on them or something. Not because he used them.\nAnd update, I am talking to him tonight when I'm off. I texted him and told him we needed to talk immediately and if he refused then I would be finding another place to live.

Never do I only have 1 roll, because who wants to run out of TP.\n2nd issue, he snooped under the bed to find the rest? Red flag he shouldnt be going under the bed for TP and has no right to look around his roommates room.\n3rd issue he brought it up and is judging OP for her having adult toys with zero understanding how many ways he has screwed up and has zero ability to judge OP.  OP can do what she wants in her bedroom/bathroom.", "NTA, get out. If he feels entitled to look through your room for your other toys, who knows what he has seen, touched, or messed with?

One time I needed a razor blade and she said she had some new ones in the bottom drawer of the bathroom vanity.\n\nWell I must have opened the wrong drawer, because what I found instead was one of those \"pocket rocket\" waterproof vibrators.  You know what I did? I closed the drawer. I did not go rummaging through her room to see if she had anything else.\n\nI also never mentioned it again.", "No NTA this is a huge invasion of your privacy.

And that's not even mentioning him hunting through your stuff to find the others. I'd be furious.", "Does he have a crush on you?

Will he put up a camera to check on you and your promiscuous wily sexy ways? Will he hide a microphone? He clearly feels he has the right to your space, your privacy, and your body! How far is he willing to take it to maintain control?\n\nDid he think upon being confronted you would have thrown all your toys away and thanked him greatly for saving you from your devious sexual nature?

Total NTA, but to have been REGULARLY scanning your room, only when you're out, is creepy, out of order, and would be enough to have him banned from my house, if it wasn't his too.

What you and any consenting adult body (yours or otherwise) do in private is not his business and he had NO reason to go searching through your belongings. Your roommate completely violated your privacy; I honestly wouldn't feel comfortable living with someone who rifles through my things.\n\nAny normal person who accidentally sees an adult toy just pretends they didn't see it or at the most sends a quick text like \"hey, don't want to embarass you but you forgot something on the bathroom sink\".", "NTA.

If you can get a lock for your door.\n\nI don't how he thinks he has any rights . He should be embarrassed that he broke into your property", "NTA. Regardless of what you got in your bathroom or room you were expecting a level of privacy that you've apparently never had. That's horseshit and I'd be livid too. Snooping isn't cool. Sorry OP.", "This is ridiculously creepy of him. I would no longer be comfortable living in the same place with him.\nNTA. And I'd find another roommate.", "These comments are too mild. \n\nYou need to get away from this person.

He had no right to snoop in your room, no matter what you left in your bathroom.  Does he have another bathroom?  \n\nThis is none of his business.", "I'm going to assume you are a straight female and he's a straight male?

You have the right to go ballistic! He has no right to go into your area without you agreeing. \n\nHe was snooping and now tried to controll your sexual activities? I would have thrown him out if I had the right to do so. It is never okay to go through someone else's stuff like that, even if it is to steal some toilet papers.\n\nI swear he is sexually attracted to you and didn't like the fact that you uses toys while he is in the same house and you aren't on him demanding sex.\n\nGet a lock to your door and make sure he can't get in anymore if you still have to leave with him.", "NTA, start locking up your room, and saving up to move out when the lease is up. Absolutely wouldn't trust him anymore, after that.", "NTA - Ngl, going in for toilet paper doesn\u2019t seem *that* bad to me, but uh\u2026 the second I saw the toy, I probably would\u2019ve walked right out unless it was an emergency. \n\nAnd if it was, him looking THROUGH YOUR ROOM is inexcusable, WTF was he doing in there?!

You need to contact the LL", "NTA.\n\nNah, nah, nah fuuuuuuck that. What is it his business what you have in YOUR personal area? Or that you have multiple toys? I\u2019d put locks on my doors (of course making sure you can in your lease and all that) and if there is already one, I\u2019d change them.

I would highly suggest finding new accomodations.", "NTA!!!!\n\nThis behavior is a huge red flag. Someone who truly respects you and cares about you would never snoop through your things, and more importantly they should be able to ignore an clean and harmless toy laying around. \n\nHis response was manipulative and ill informed.

You may think you have a good relationship with him otherwise but there is something really unsettling about his lack of boundaries.", "NTA\n\nFirst off, if it was in YOUR bathroom, not his so he definitely has no right to be lecturing you like your father about what you keep out in your bathroom. Secondly, to go in your room without even asking if he can and for why is a major privacy violation that he should be worried about. Lastly, the fact he went snooping which means he wanted to find your kinky stuff. Definitely get a camera and a new lock set so he can't do it again. If he asks why, tell him he violated your trust and that since it is your room, he shouldn't have an issue with you locking it because nothing in there is his concern.", "NTA.

Wow!  He invades your space and then wants to sit in judgement on your private activities?  Thats a whole new level of cheek.  I suppose that means his masterbatory habits are up for discussion and it's important to make sure he is not doing anything you might consider \"gross.\"  No happy socks in the wash!   All lotions are only for moiturizing skin, any other applications are a breach of the roommate code. Any porn sites surfed online must meet your approval because you need to be sure that A.) They're not too 'disgusting\" and B.) too much time engaged in said pursuit wanders into \"sex addict\" territory!-", "Your roommate is being a sex shaming prude and is the asshole.

He's already shown he has no boundaries, doesn't respect your privacy or autonomy, and has an unhealthy obsession with you sexually. His actions and expectations are not consistent with a mentally well or stable person. \n\nYour friend is wrong, you weren't hard enough but that may be a good thing because he's not rational. Despite his self-described concern/disgust, you don't actually know if he's been using those toys on himself this whole time. He said he's overlooked it before which means he's known about them for some time. I just read that post about the guy jacking off into his secretary's food; it's not a huge leap to imagine this guy doing similar things to your toys since he feels entitled to control what you do.\n\nPlease leave, OP. NTA.", "NTA. You need a new roommate ASAP.", "NTA.\n\nHow many toys you have is none of his business and there's nothing unhealthy about that.

Yelling at him is the minimum he deserves.", "He's concerned for your health? What?! Because you use sex toys? NTA. He majorly violated boundaries.", "This is one of the creepiest posts I've seen yet on here. What your roommate did was so disgustingly out of line, it's hard to find words. \n\nYour self pleasure habits are absolutely none of his business. Unless you're playing around on the living room couch or the kitchen counter none of this involves him. He sounds like a very typical misogynist, threatened by your sexuality and especially threatened by a woman's ability to find pleasure without a man. It definitely happens. \n\nHe sounds deranged, uber controlling, and potentially dangerous (apparently you think so to as you think it was possible he put hot sauce or something to hurt you on your toys).\n\nNo matter what he says tonight please move out.

No more toothbrush, just a thin dildo on the counter! Put a loofah on a suction cup toy and put it on the bathroom wall.

And rather than examine that interpersonally, he's chosen the Principal Skinner meme route of shaming *you* as the problem.\n\nYou're both adults; you don't need to justify anything to him nor have been softer on him in the moment of the conflict (as your friend poorly suggested). Men don't need to be coddled because dildos scare them or make them feel threatened.

Definitely a good wash was in order, maybe two for bad juju. And brochacho needs to learn to properly inventory his tp and keep some emergency wet wipes under HIS sink.
