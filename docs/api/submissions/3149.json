I washed them as an extra precaution just in case something was done to them like hot sauce being put on them or something. Not because he used them.\nAnd update, I am talking to him tonight when I'm off. I texted him and told him we needed to talk immediately and if he refused then I would be finding another place to live.

A lock on the door and a security camera sound like good ideas in the mean time.", "Leaving it lying around in the common bathroom is not great.  \nOn the other hand, in no case he has to judge you on what you do, except if he is jealous? :D  \nLikewise, he has nothing to do in your room, that's pretty crazy.", "NTA and yes definitely get a lock for your room or get a new roommate", "NTA.\n\nTbh, I'd have given one of my unused ones, before telling to go eff himself \\^\\_\\^", "Girl\u2026 This is not a talk it out situation\u2026 this is a move out right away situation.", "N.T.A. AT ALL. He is a creep.", "I think the toys sparked his fantasies. He\u2019s now either upset he has those fantasies or he\u2019s intimidated by your sexual freedom\u2026 either way I think he\u2019s placing the blame on you for his feelings and fantasies. And instead of taking responsibility for snooping in your private things he\u2019s going to blame you for tempting him.", "Why would the amount of sex toys you have have anything to do with him? Why are you trying to understand his point of view about what you do with your vagina? Does a part of you agree with him that he has some say over what you do with your vagina??", "I bet that it wasn\u2019t the amount more so the size of some of the toys because men are very insecure about their own penis size that they\u2019re constantly measuring it and constantly asking their sex partner if it is big enough.", "I'd ask him if he has a different view of your relationship than forever friends. Does he see your relationship going elsewhere in the future? Say, if you're both still single at 30 for instance. \n\nIn his mind he could very well be the nr. 1 guy in your life (long history, living together, sharing secrets, you not dating anyone else.)\n\nHe might view you very differently from how you view him, and feel entitled to all kinds of things involving you. If this is the case, and he's some \"nice guy\" in hiding, your problems might have only started. But you need to find out.\n\nDon't squash your first, healthy instincts of shock and indignation, just because society tells you to be nice. Be safe.", "He wants you to have sex with him\nInstead of those toys.", "Yea OP is weird herself at this point. If she likes his creepiness then oh well", "It\u2019s not \u2018normal\u2019 behavior to you because you didn\u2019t know about it. His been doing this for a long time, you just didn\u2019t know about it.", "He\u2019s creeping on you and believe he has some sort of say about what you do sexually and how you pleasure your body. That\u2019s deeply disturbing.", "You\u2019re putting your safety at risk by continuing to live with this dude, just so you know. You\u2019re putting his emotional comfort above your personal physical safety.", "INFO: can you explain why you think it would/should matter to him how many toys you have? What\u2019s your logic behind that?", "It's not the first time. He said it himself, he's snooped through your stuff before. This is just the first time he's admitted it and escalated it to blaming you for his actions.", "He\u2019s probably got 5 different shades of pocket pussies under his bed and they\u2019re probably not clean.", "Right. Women and Sex are for baby making!", "Trying not to barf cause you're probably right", "I have 20+ toys and over 100+ sexy lingerie sets and roleplay outfits, which neither of our collections are excessive nor is it anyone\u2019s business what we enjoy doing with OUR bodies.", "I doubt it is so, but it might. People are weird.\n\nAnyway, NTA, and the roommate is the AH.", "They also wouldn\u2019t then go searching and find the tote under the bed with the rest.", "NTA\n\nsure it may have been uncomfortable if he found a toy under the sink. It\u2019s definitely something he could\u2019ve just been like \u201chey, this happened and it made me uncomfortable please don\u2019t let it happen again\u201d even if it was an accident on your part it\u2019s just something to blow over. But he\u2019s WAY outta line to go and snoop for more and tbh that\u2019s extremely creepy and perverted for him to go and look for more + even just searching your PRIVATE room", "NTA he\u2019s an asshole and your friend is an idiot. You did nothing wrong. Anyone who says otherwise can kick rocks.", "Time to get a new roommate. Sounds like there has been bubbling tension in this relationship for a good while.", "I feel like he thought this conversation would turn into a lame porn scene. He confronts the roommate. She\u2019s embarrassed but offers to use them with him."]}
