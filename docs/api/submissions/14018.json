My daughter turned 9 today, 4/4, and we\u2019re having her birthday party this weekend at a family fun center near where we live. \n\nYesterday, we made invites after Emma finished her homework, and I noticed she made an invite for every kid in her class, except one girl - we will call her \u201cKay\u201d. I asked her why she made an invite for everyone except her, and she told me Kay has been bullying her best friend \u201cBrianna\u201d, and that at recess she called Brianna (a Black girl) a slur against Black people. She told me both Brianna and her have already told their teacher about the problem, but so far nothing has happened. I told her that I understood why she didn\u2019t want her at the party, and that it was okay to not invite her. Today, she went to school, and at recess, handed out the invites to every kid in her class- except Kay. \n\nA few hours later, I noticed I got a new message on Instagram, so I clicked on it, to find a woman claiming to be Kay\u2019s mother. She told me that Kay had told her that she did not get an invite to Emma\u2019s party while every other kid in the class did, and demanded that Kay be invited to the party. I told her that Emma had told me that Kay called Emma\u2019s best friend a racial slur, and she completely denied it, telling me that Kay would never do anything like that, and that Emma was \u201cbullying\u201d her by excluding her from the party. I blocked her. \n\nI talked to my family members about the situation, and while most of them were on my side, my sister \u201cMelissa\u201d (33F) told me that it was kind of a dick move to not invite just one kid to a party over something that didn\u2019t directly affect my daughter, and I should just invite her because it\u2019s not a huge deal. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680656577, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c37nz/aita_for_not_inviting_one_kid_to_my_daughters/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well it does! and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want the other girl at her party. Children learn by example.

But even if she didn't have a \"good reason\", it's still her party and she shouldn't be forced to have a guest she doesn't want.  That simple.\n\nThe only other thing you could have done was have a smaller party so it wasn't absolutely everyone else in class invited...but if your kid gets along with the whole class, she shouldn't be penalized for being popular.", "All these comments saying she shouldn't have handed the invites out at school. How else would it be done?", "NTA", "NTA I don't care why you are not inviting the kid, I'm just tired of the you have to invite everyone rule. My kids have never once had a birthday party with friends from school because I don't want to host 20 kids when my kids really only wanted to invite 3 or 4 actual friends.", "NTA. It probably would have been better to mail the invites and avoid this conflict but eh what are you going to do? \n\nYour sister's wrong though, the slur did directly affect your daughter. If she was present to witness the bullying or if she only witnessed the aftermath of an upset friend, it left a mark.\n\nYour sister is also wrong about whether dropping a slur at 9 is a big deal or not.  It might not be Kay's fault, she might just be emulating adults around her, but  it still makes her and her family potentially dangerous to you and your daughter.  Kay didn't cuss, she used a derogatory slur and knew enough about it to direct it towards a black person in a move that seemed geared to make Brianna feel bad about herself for how she was born. You don't want that kind of person near your daughter.", "NTA. Too many commenting about invite policies for one. Their minds might explore when they find out my kid's school has you put them in a folder and the teacher will take them out one by one throughout the day if the whole class isn't invited. \nANYWAYS\nThis kid just learned a hard lesson that I'm sure she's never learned at home. It's called repercussions and consequence. We don't forgive racism in our household. We do try to give an opportunity to teach, if able to, though.", "NTA. They need to learn young that racism is not okay and there are consequences for it.", "NTA: I don't care about the hurt feelings of a racist bully??? In fact, its better this way. That way she can learn not only consequences but empathy.", "NTA - When racial slurs are made, it affects all of us. The same with ethnic, religious or sexual-orientation, size, etc. slurs. I'd think 9 year old kids know right from wrong. Your daughter sure knew it was wrong of Kay. I'm for kids and adults who take a stand on totally unacceptable behavior.", "NTA. Racists don\u2019t deserve to be invited to parties. Good for you for not only respecting your daughter\u2019s decision, but also because you\u2019ve clearly taught her to be a good person.", "nta\n\ni dont think kay should be invited, either, because she was being racist towards emma\u2019s friend, and as a mixed girl, i genuinely cant believe this shit is still going on. the only problem is you shouldn\u2019t have let emma give invites to every other kid in front of the class, humiliating her\n\nedit: do some of you not realize that calling someone a racial slur and not being invited to a birthday party are not on the same level", "It's a huge deal...NTA - If you did not believe your daughter it teaches her to not tell you the deep hurtful things she experiences. You have no reason to think she is lying. It is her party and her reason to not invite a peer is fine. Don't be like the teacher who does nothing. It's a huge deal to solidify and support your daughter.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA for one reason, and one reason alone: Emma handed out the invitations during school which made it really obvious that only one person was excluded.\n\nIn general, though, if the invitations had gone out privately, I wouldn\u2019t have invited Kay, either.", "NTA.

I'm going to go with NTA still, but you should have been a bit more aware of how it will look to the school and used a more tactful approach.
