My daughter turned 9 today, 4/4, and we\u2019re having her birthday party this weekend at a family fun center near where we live. \n\nYesterday, we made invites after Emma finished her homework, and I noticed she made an invite for every kid in her class, except one girl - we will call her \u201cKay\u201d. I asked her why she made an invite for everyone except her, and she told me Kay has been bullying her best friend \u201cBrianna\u201d, and that at recess she called Brianna (a Black girl) a slur against Black people. She told me both Brianna and her have already told their teacher about the problem, but so far nothing has happened. I told her that I understood why she didn\u2019t want her at the party, and that it was okay to not invite her. Today, she went to school, and at recess, handed out the invites to every kid in her class- except Kay. \n\nA few hours later, I noticed I got a new message on Instagram, so I clicked on it, to find a woman claiming to be Kay\u2019s mother. She told me that Kay had told her that she did not get an invite to Emma\u2019s party while every other kid in the class did, and demanded that Kay be invited to the party. I told her that Emma had told me that Kay called Emma\u2019s best friend a racial slur, and she completely denied it, telling me that Kay would never do anything like that, and that Emma was \u201cbullying\u201d her by excluding her from the party. I blocked her. \n\nI talked to my family members about the situation, and while most of them were on my side, my sister \u201cMelissa\u201d (33F) told me that it was kind of a dick move to not invite just one kid to a party over something that didn\u2019t directly affect my daughter, and I should just invite her because it\u2019s not a huge deal. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680656577, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c37nz/aita_for_not_inviting_one_kid_to_my_daughters/", "score": 895, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It probably would have been better to mail the invites and avoid this conflict but eh what are you going to do? \n\nYour sister's wrong though, the slur did directly affect your daughter. If she was present to witness the bullying or if she only witnessed the aftermath of an upset friend, it left a mark.\n\nYour sister is also wrong about whether dropping a slur at 9 is a big deal or not.  It might not be Kay's fault, she might just be emulating adults around her, but  it still makes her and her family potentially dangerous to you and your daughter.  Kay didn't cuss, she used a derogatory slur and knew enough about it to direct it towards a black person in a move that seemed geared to make Brianna feel bad about herself for how she was born. You don't want that kind of person near your daughter.", "NTA. Too many commenting about invite policies for one. Their minds might explore when they find out my kid's school has you put them in a folder and the teacher will take them out one by one throughout the day if the whole class isn't invited. \nANYWAYS\nThis kid just learned a hard lesson that I'm sure she's never learned at home. It's called repercussions and consequence. We don't forgive racism in our household. We do try to give an opportunity to teach, if able to, though.", "NTA.

That way she can learn not only consequences but empathy.", "NTA - When racial slurs are made, it affects all of us. The same with ethnic, religious or sexual-orientation, size, etc. slurs.

I'm going to go with NTA still, but you should have been a bit more aware of how it will look to the school and used a more tactful approach.

Your sister is wrong, though, because the situation does affect your daughter- it is her friend that is being bullied. How many times have we seen news stories of bullied kids taking their own lives and their true friends having to go on in school and life without them. I lost a friend a few years ago to a guy who had gotten drunk and taken drugs, then got in his car and decided to kill someone that day. He killed a wonderful person who had helped me navigate my first two years in a new school.  When I got the message from another friend about it, it felt like a sucker punch in my gut. She had just gotten married two years before to another school friend and they were talking about having kids. I tear up just writing about it now. No man is an island, and someone as kind and caring as your daughter will be affected by what is going on with her best friend. In my friend's case, the letter her husband read to the guy after he was sentenced to life in prison was both gut wrenching and blunt- paraphrased and shortened: you took a beautiful soul away and took with her all of our future plans; I hope your hell is to see her face every time you close your eyes for the rest of your life.", "NTA.

OP\u2019s daughter and Briana told the teacher but I doubt the teacher did anything about it. \n\nI am Asian and was bullied when I studied in the US. My experience is in no way near what black people experience on a daily basis. I have been receiving micro aggressions about Asian stereotypes. They just thought it was funny. We were in law school and all adults. Since I didn\u2019t communicate my issue, it didn\u2019t stop. Until I did, and it did stop. Unfortunately, many still don\u2019t know how much their words affect others, and if we don\u2019t communicate it to them, they might not ever know. \n\nI think that\u2019s why the bully feels like they are being bullied because they don\u2019t know why they were the only one not invited.

You are only convincing me that you think a racist slur is not a big deal.", "Sigh .....\n\nYou are a lost cause I see", "Oh I see. So this was just a misunderstanding, the kid thought she was giving the Black child a compliment. Well in that case\u2026", "> I am Asian and was bullied when I studied in the US. My experience is in no way near what black people experience on a daily basis.\n\nYour experience is different, but it isn't less than. And even if someone else is going through something worse, that doesn't make your experiences with bigotry insignificant or not as bad. I'm sorry that you had to deal with such awful things during your time in the U.S.\n\n> I recognize that she was bullied and her feelings were hurt, but that wasn\u2019t the question of OP so I only addressed the feelings of the bully. \n\nRacism isn't just bullying and hurt feelings. Its discrimination and trauma. While discrimination is a form of bullying, bullying isn't always a form of discrimination.\n\nThe whole situation is very precarious. I think OP handled it the best they could. Because even if they did tell Kay the exact reason she was not invited, that could just have led her to lash out and target Brianna even more than she had before- especially because the teacher and her parents have done nothing about it before.\n\n> I think that\u2019s why the bully feels like they are being bullied because they don\u2019t know why they were the only one not invited.

Because the parents are enabling the behavior. The intricacies on racism are complex. Especially in a situation of a child saying a slur, its not a situation that can be easily resolved by just saying \"You say a racial slur and we don't feel comfortable inviting you\". That's not gonna make the child feel less like a victim, they'll feel it even more. If they're just there to hand out the invitations, it wasn't really the right place to educate the child. There's really only so much OP can do when Kay is not her child. Who knows if she'd be receptive and in such a short timeframe? Or double-down? I don't think OP was the AH for the way they handled things. There isn't a perfect way to handle racism. Especially when its being caused by child that isn't under there care.", "I highly doubt that OP's daughter did not tell the bully she didn't like that she hurt her friend or that she had said a bad word. At least they have been avoiding the bully since that time. From how OP worded it, it sounds like her daughter isn't one to take things lying down. I don't know her personally though, so I can't say definitively.\nAs many of the teachers and councilors above have noted and the bully was spoken to in private, she knows she upset the best friend and that her language is unacceptable, had a chance to apologize or stop her behavior and she has not. Then she was not invited to the party. If she shrugged off the school, this is another clear signal that she is not welcome after her actions and words.\nI have to say, not sure who in your situation was supposed to talk to the bully if the school didn't. The girls as you have said are nine, and I can't imagine OP walking up to a child, accusing her of racism, and telling her she's not invited to her daughter's party because of what she said playing out very well. Who's left then? The school should have handled it by this point, so she would have been talked to. If they have not, something has to be done to express that her words are not welcome and are not okay. I understand wanting to protect the child and make sure she is not being wrongfully dealt with, but kids are not stupid and she is old enough to know when someone is upset because of something she said.\nI also want to apologize for you having to deal with microagressions and racism. It's very stupid we judge others based on physical looks and not on how they act. You seem like a lovely person.", "The fact that Kay's mom make a big deal of her daughter not being invited and denying that her daughter was racist or a bully tells me that the school in fact did nothing", "Thank you!

Disciplinary records are covered under FERPA.\n\nWhy are you assuming the OP is living somewhere where FERPA laws exist?   Then making that fact and running with it??\n\n OP has not stated where they live...\n\n>You can't assume the school did nothing just because they didn't publicly announce the consequences. Not saying what the child did was right and not defending the school if they didn't take action of some kind.

That is absolutely wild.  I would expect better from a school counselor.", "Can we also talk about the fact that where do you think this little girl heard the slur? Kids learn from what they see at home a lot of the time.", "Idk. I once called a black kid racist for constantly calling me \"ching chong\" around the playground.\n\nGuess who got in trouble...", "I never had the number of any of my kids' friends unless they were hanging out outside of school, and that information became relevant. I have never heard of a school doing it either. Do you really get a handout with all of the other kids' parents' numbers? That seems like a problem waiting to happen. 9 year olds see their friend at school", "Or Kay's mom is living in Egypt.", "You don't think Kay's mom would lie?", "Yeah, I understand the rule, but its impact is probably more negative than positive. I also see how people are saying \"Well if Kay knows she wasn't invited because she is saying racist things, it will mean she may learn not to be racist\", but this is probably a very clear school rule (not handing out invites at school while excluding one of the kids) and by breaking it, it's probably ensuring Kay is invited to the party, thus learning that there isn't really any consequences for her racism and also means Brianna has to be at a party with her racist bully.\n\nIf OP could have invited people outside of school, thus not breaking the rule, Kay probably would have found out about the party but there would have been no kickback about the rule-breaking.", "As a parent, I still wouldn\u2019t invite the kid making racist comments even if she was disciplined already. Especially with a mom who acts like that.", "Well since Emma was involved in the situation and reported the racism, her parents should have been notified. OP had no idea about this incident until Emma told her. Thus, it\u2019s safe to assume that the problem is not being handled by anyone.", "I'm sure Emma would have told her mom if the teacher, or whoever was told about the situation, got Kay in trouble/sent her to the office for using a racial slur.", "The Other child\u2019s mom said it was a lie in the social media message.So how much further is it going to go? It\u2019s basically their words against the other kid at this point. But considering all schools are supposed have zero tolerance (bullying /fighting/weapons in schools/ violent threats) and that kid is still in school I would hazard a guess that nothing has been said by the teacher to anyone else above her., because if she did that kid at the least should have been suspended at the most expelled.", "Of course they\u2019re not going to discuss punishment with other students. But it\u2019s going to be pretty obvious if a student is being punished (detention, suspension, loss of privileges), and also pretty obvious if they aren\u2019t. Also, kids aren\u2019t stupid; if the teacher had talked to Kay about the issue it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for her to work out who told on her, and since she has no problem bullying using racial slurs I find it hard to believe that Kay wouldn\u2019t confront Emma and Brianna for telling on her. And even if the teacher kept the issue vague (not specifically mentioning the slur) and Kay has been bullying other students too, leading to her not knowing who told about what, she likely still would have kicked up a fuss with one or some of their classmates that she suspected of telling on her. And then even if Emma and Brianna hadn\u2019t been confronted by Kay, they would have heard about it from other classmates and known that the teacher spoke to Kay. Bullies aren\u2019t the type to let things like that go.", "It SHOULDN'T be handled privately. She called another child, another person a slur out in the open so she should be disciplined out in the open. That's what zero tolerance is supposed to mean. Shut that shit down and let everyone know it is unacceptable. When you ever give the appearance of tolerance to racism/sexism/homophobia etc you allow it breed and spread. That's why this whole country is so effing toxic right now.", "Or Emma is lying.", "I do not understand why schools have assumed to have so much authority . & why parents have allowed them to ... take it. I know, too many parents have just given up & abdicated *their* parental responsibilities. Ugh", "I agree. I was responding to a comment saying the teacher can't be trusted.", "Totally agree. I'm not a parent, but I can't imagine contacting a fellow parent and demand that my child be invited to a party. I would contact and ask why though.", "Best practice is to handle behavior issues in private whenever possible. There are plenty of consequences (such as a call home, or meeting with the councilor) that Emma would not be aware of.", "Are you really suggesting that 9 year olds should be expelled because someone said they used a racial slur one time? No proof that it actually happened, no warning not to do it again, no lesson about why they shouldn't be using a word that they likely learned at home. Just \"you're obviously a lost cause so get out and don't come back!\" I've worked in a lot of schools. I've never worked in one that would suspend or expel a kid for this if it were a first offense. There are plenty of other ways to handle behavior issues that have a much better chance at teaching the kid to do better.", "I just understand the rule because it came out of situations where kids specifically excluded a kid because they're not cool or because they're disabled or whatever reason kids want to exclude a kid - inviting all the other kids and making it obvious that one kid is excluded. In a situation like this, where the excluded kid is saying racist things and being excluded to make a black kid comfortable at the party, I totally get it, it's just that in the past, it absolutely has been used to exclude a kid just because sometimes kids are mean. Inviting all the kids except one has probably (definitely) even been used in the past to be racist and exclude a non-white kid.\n\nI don't work in schools, and I don't have kids, so thankfully I don't have to think about a way to solve this problem without having 'too much authority', but I can definitely understand why some schools would have a rule that's like \"You're not allowed to hand out invites at school and specifically exclude one child\" because, in general (not necessarily here, but in general), this behaviour can actually be bullying.", "Yea, public discipline is usually frowned upon so there isn\u2019t really any basis to say the teacher is not acting on it.", "That too, but my main concern is the absolute insistence that her child did no wrong. Kids make mistakes (and racist language is learned, usually at home). What a parent SHOULD do is to teach the child appropriate behaviour/language/inclusion, obviously this mom hasn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t plan to. That is not a family I would invite, especially at the expense of other guests who are closer to OPs daughter.", "Ok as an ex teacher myself though, that\u2019s terrible social teaching. You need to tell the kids yes we will deal with Kay and this behavior is not acceptable. Obviously, no details of any punishment but it\u2019s a horribly inappropriate lesson for Emma and especially her friend if they were left with the impression Kay had no repercussions at all for being racist. The little Black girl is not going to feel safe at school if she was left with the idea a teacher did nothing.", "Okay, but again, Emma said the teacher didn't do anything in that moment. When I was in school, if anyone said a racial slur, or even just a \"bad\" word, they were immediately sent out of the room or to the office. \n\nI work with children everyday, the older children have told me on numerous occasions about kids saying bad things and getting in trouble. Clearly nothing was done in that moment when Kay decided to hurt Brianna, or Emma wouldn't have said the teacher did nothing.", "No that\u2019s not what I wrote read it again. I\u2019m not suggesting anything. I stated a fact that most schools have tough rules against things like this.. especially with all the happenings going on in school in America.", "Thank all the gods I don't even believe in that I haven't got children. Having been one of the bullied, I would find it very difficult, as an adult, to have a school tell me how I should, must, raise *my* child. Especially when I know the child has done the right thing. I have developed a healthy aversion to those who've deluded themselves in to believing they some level of undeserved authority.", "According to OP, this incident happened at recess. In many places teachers don't go to recess with their classes, even when they do, it's impossible to listen in to every conversation and very unlikely that a kid would be using a racial slur directly in front of her. There's no \"immediately\" if you didn't actually witness the issue. Kids get confused, they forget, they lie. If a student comes in and tells you someone did something mean, you don't immediately send them to the office. You have to investigate first to get the whole story. Sometimes you have 20 kids coming in to do a math lesson and don't have the time or the man power to drop everything and investigate one kid's recess activities so you get through the lesson and start asking around when you get a minute. To the kids, that often looks like \"the teacher did nothing\" when in reality it was addressed at a different time.", "You should check your facts. Most schools are not suspending or expelling students for a one time use of a racial slur. There are other ways to take things seriously.", "I definitely believe an aversion to undeserved authority makes sense. I think in this case, the rule is at least more understandable than banning chess or coloured hair or ridiculous dress codes for girls or whatever the other crazy rules there are these days. Kids can invite whoever they want to their party... as long as they don't do it in front of the kids who aren't invited. I don't know if I fully agree with the rule, but I can see how it came about and I don't know what I would do if I was a teacher seeing it happen in front of me (again, thank the gods I also don't believe in that I don't have to make these decisions)."]}
