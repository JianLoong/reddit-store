She tearfully and happily accepted. \n\nWedding day: she demanded I stay for the wedding reception intimate dinner. Her dad said his camera was better than mine and he didn't know what I was doing there anyways. The bride complained every time I asked her to pose in beautiful natural light and said she didn't see the point because she would never care about her wedding photos anyways. It was a weird day! \n\nI heard nothing from her after the wedding for a few weeks - then suddenly she invited me to a Christmas party. I told her I'd bring her photos. She told me the party was cancelled 2 hours before the start, and I later learned I was actually disinvited (the party happened without me). \n\nThe bride ghosted me for 3 months after this. Then she popped up demanding her wedding photos. \n\nBUT in those 3 months I learned she and our mutual female friends were taking / texting nasty things about me behind my back. \"The only thing she's good for is her cooking\" \"she only offered to photograph the wedding because she's desperate for friends\" etc., \n\nThen I learned the gaggle of women actually reached out to my former abuser - who'd I escaped in 2020 and moved across the country and changed my name to gain safety. My abuser called my actual best friend to have her warn me my \"new friends were trying to sabotage me\".  They told him where I was ... edit: he used this a way to TRY and draw me back to him and to him and he faked concern to try and manipulate my friend into giving him more information about me. His efforts failed. I had disappeared brilliantly, until these malevolent women called him. (There's also possible that my abuser was genuinely upset that someone was trying to sabotage me because historically he didn't like when I was wrong by other people, but he had no problem with his own abuse towards me. If you have never been abused I don't expect you to understand this)\n\nThey did sabotage me and still do. They deliberately sabotaged two jobs I was hired for and as of recent a wholesale account I had for my bakery as of 2023. They went to my wholesaler and lied - saying I don't have a real bakery and it's all baked in my home kitchen. \n\nNow! the bride is thwarting my membership at church because I still haven't given her the photos. Seems I will get approved regardless of her efforts to sabotage after I shared these details with an elder who agrees I was betrayed/hurt. \n\nI realized I was being bullied - badly so - and used - and deeply betrayed- so I didn't feel the need to fulfill my obligation to her. After all her dad took photos so she has wedding photos.

They were trying to convey to me how loved I am within the church while  acknowledging that I've been deeply hurt within the church. They convinced me to stay in the church and right now I don't have the financial means to make my attendance worthwhile unless they genuinely actually like me... So I think this was just his genuine attempt to convey that I am loved because he knows that need that reassurance.", "I think eventually there will be peace.

I struggle to understand what's going on in their tiny little minds that they feel the need to out you to your abusive ex and (successfully) sabotage your business??  \n\nWhat nasty, petty, small, ugly, hate filled people.  \n \nThey must be so insecure and damaged.    \n \nYou really should look at taking some sort of legal action, otherwise thry won't stop. They'll just bode their time and fume until they blow up again.     \nI'm truly lost for words at how dark these people are.", "Yeah, it's wild how much you can dig out with just a little know how.\n\nWhich is why it's useful for those looking to escape their abusers by disappearing to know the most common tricks, so they can safeguard against them. It's scary to go down that rabbit hole, and you should do it with a level head, but keeping all your shit locked down is important for escaping abusers who may be inclined to follow.", "I did this long ago to prove to a friend that we should never post names and tag friends on public accounts. \n\nI used just her name (really common eg Maggie Smith) and was able to dig up everything in college, who her friends were, where they lived, where she hung out and even established a routine based on their posts. \n\nShe was convinced after that and thanked me for showing her how deceptive it can be to think it\u2019s \u201cjust a photo\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just a common name\u201d. \n\nThis was *before* smartphones existed so if I could do that when we were on dialup, just imagine the magnitude and depth of doxxing  *today*.\n\nPlease be careful, everyone!", "Oh man, this sounds interesting!

Anyone getting on her bad side must surely be a fool.", "You got a link or a name or something? And does she do it privately, or are you basically consenting to let her post about you?", "With friends like that, who needs enemies. I would go the pastor and explain exactly what this woman is doing. I would then consider finding another church because this one is not safe. \n\nI hope you live is a big enough town or city to not have any contact with them.", "Yeah, if you're not god, then whatever they do to you, they can just ask their god for forgiveness and poof! All better. For them, anyway. \n\nI have found that in some churches, there seems to be a misunderstanding of what being \"Christian\" means. Hard-hearted and disingenuous don't fit the bill; but hey, so what, right?

Like you said, loads of other Christian churches do though.", "Except in like Germany, where you have the state giving your money to the religion of your choice and it can be hard to get out if you got in when you didn't know better.", "Not true.  The Catholic Church doesn\u2019t require tithing.", "Agreed, but no Catholic church I have ever been to requires a percentage of your income.", "Never betray yourself. You should never be put in a position to light yourself on fire to keep others warm. Anyone who insists you should will always conveniently hold the flame, and will gladly burn your life down.

Next time she demands them, tell her you did something in kindness for a friend, but as she is neither kind, nor your friend, you aren\u2019t under obligation to help her. Also, look into a lawyer because what they did by damaging your professional life is 100% illegal, so keep track of how much you lost from their scheming, and sue them for it. People like that will continue to bully others, and the next person could literally *die* from what they did. They outed and doxxed you to your abuser. They were hoping you\u2019d be physically and mentally harmed by their actions. Do not let this slide. While you might be ok, and be forgiving, and not want vengeance, they will likely escalate their behavior on their next targeted victim, and that next victim might not be as lucky as you were.", "Some of your responses make it seem like you're just too nice, and you're letting yourself get walked on...

You don't need reddit to tell you something you already know, and you're still going to be a good person after deleting the pictures... you'll just be a good person who didn't like being treated like shit \ud83d\udc95", "It sounds Mormon to me.

But honestly I was shocked to read here that you\u2019re contractually obligated to give 10% of your earnings to this church. Maybe I\u2019m sheltered in my Catholicism, but it\u2019s outrageous to me to think that the church A. gets to know what I make, and B. has a say in how much of that comes to them.
