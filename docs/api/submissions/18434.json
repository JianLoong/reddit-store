A smart phone is a luxury, not a necessity - so I don't think it's terrible to have a child pay for their own in some fashion (partially or fully, with cash or by earning in kind around the house or whatever). An iPhone 12 in particular is well above what a 14 year old *needs*, perhaps what they've paid for is an upgrade on what their parents were willing to pay for?\n\nRegardless, internet safety and technological literacy is very real and important. Kids don't get to just buy their way out of being *appropriately* parented. I'm not totally familiar with the apps that their parents want to use or how they work, so I can't judge whether they're also going a bit far with just how much they want to monitor - but some level of monitoring is ok here. Especially things like total screen time and/or what apps are being utilised most heavily as these are both pretty important factors in determining how their child's phone use is likely to impact them, without totally violating privacy (i.e. I don't think they should be able to read every message or text, etc)", "It broke on Monday and I didn't have time all week, and then we went on a trip over labor day weekend.

However, parenting apps can often just raise kids that are crafty (and sometimes distant) enough to get around the boundaries their parents set. Internet safety is very important, but I feel that teaching a child what they need to know to protect themselves and giving them the confidence to get help from their guardians raises a child that is smart enough to carry their own weight when they eventually get too old for that parenting app. I wish I had more time to get resources, but every parent should understand the pros and cons of how they choose to handle internet safety.

At a certain point the parents should, instead of cracking down (like here), encourage their kids to explore things like this further.\n\nHaving both an iPhone and a Pixel hanging around tells me the OP is a budding tech enthusiast, and the Pixel having GrapheneOS goes a long way toward confirming that.

With that said, I can definitely think back to my middle school years and pick out people that could very easily be impacted and/or manipulated by others. Their parents should have a say in how they deal with that.", "Maybe they should. Maybe children and parents aren't all the same and it's super easy to judge people based on your own experiences only, nice and comfortable from the safety of your reddit account.", "Correct I\u2019m not, but I was a teenager once and I can envision that this would be something my mother would have done, and I hate the idea of it. sure you can limit your child\u2019s access to porn, at home and on their phone etc, but children and teenagers aren\u2019t stupid (for the most part) they will find ways around the monitoring or a friend will show them how to, or just straight up show them the shit you might not want them to see.", "Lololololol\n\nWhy is the first instinct of a parent when their child starts puberty is to try to make sure they are shielded from any and all sex stuff.\n\nOh no, the kid might look at porn, better become Amish!", "I can do the same, and while some parents would step in and stop or talk to their kids bout it, others wouldn\u2019t, same now days I spose", "You will break out of your rose tinted glasses when you are a bit older, you are still too young to overall have a reasonable view on how unmonitored internet access will affect you", "> as someone who was recently 14 i disagree\n\nSHOCKED!", "And as someone who is an adult and grew up with unmonitored access to the internet (as it was new), I can confidently tell you that you\u2019re wrong. Using the internet for looking up words? Really? No reasonable parents are trying to protect their kids from the dictionary app.", "Yup, they\u2019ll find ways, but the longer it can be delayed, the better. Allowing a 14 year old unfettered access to the internet and unlimited screen time is irresponsible.", "you have no idea how old i am or the shot i\u2019ve been through", "recently could be anywhere from 5 years to 2 weeks", "As someone who also grew up with unmonitored access to the internet (also was new) I can confidently tell you that you're wrong. They're old enough to be entitled to privacy in these matters, if you want to be a better parent you should ensure your kids are comfortable coming to you for help and advise on anything and not because you're stalking and reading their personal conversations or watching their browser history.\n\nThere are adults who probably shouldn't have unmonitored access but that's a whole different subject.", "watching porn is completely normal, i don\u2019t agree with it. i\u2019ve never done it, i know a lot of kids who don\u2019t do it. however, nudity is a massive part of growing up and gaining experience in life and your body. he deserves the right to explore without all these controls. i\u2019m assuming the parents control the internet and can therefore (i think i could be wrong) check the internet history from the device", "It\u2019s also their choice since they are paying for the device in question. If they weren\u2019t sure, parents should have more of a say, I can agree with that. But if op is affording and paying for his own phone plan, as well as the google pixel, with his own money, he should be allowed to set his own rules.", "I mean.. you were recently 14.. right?", "I would bet if you're currently 19, if you were able to go back in time and chat with your 14 year-old self, you'd probably suffer significant frustration at how cringey you were. Just food for thought.", "Nobody is stalking anyone\u2019s conversations nor are they scrolling feverishly through browser history just hoping to find something wrong. I have a 15 year old son who happens to be gay - I\u2019ve seen stuff I wasn\u2019t even looking for just helping him with his homework. Monitoring is to ensure safety, not for me to spy on my kid. \n\nI used to not monitor and then my (at the time) 7 year old started a TikTok account of her dancing and cheering (both of which she is really good at) and ended up with well over 100 followers in the span of 2 weeks. Over 40 of them were grown men. So no, I\u2019m not letting my children have unrestricted access to the internet. I\u2019ve failed once and I won\u2019t again. I\u2019m a really good mom, and I\u2019m not going to let someone tell me that I\u2019m not bc I don\u2019t just let my kids go wherever they want and do whatever they want on the internet.", "Unless either of you are actual psychologists, you're just saying ignorant things back and forth to each other. Most kids will probably be fine, but some kids won't. There's a mountain of data that shows how social media and pornography CAN negatively impact formative years. Parents of 14 year olds get to have the final say in the access of that material under their roof. Full stop.", "This isn\u2019t only about pornography. Yes, porn is a big part of it, but the internet is so much more than porn. There are children/teens who get support to have eating disorders or commit s*icide on the internet. There are children and teens who get groomed on social media. Or trafficked. It is a dangerous place for many people and teens just don\u2019t need unrestricted access. The sex stuff isn\u2019t even the biggest concern for me. Regardless, your argument about kids not being able to learn more if they\u2019re being monitored is wrong, and your thoughts and opinions on adolescents and sexuality isn\u2019t anything that I really need to be lectured on. I\u2019ve not said one thing about it other that pornography is not good or healthy. Which is just a fact.", "While I don\u2019t make my kid pay for their plan, I can see why it would be a good idea, and I don\u2019t think it would absolve them of content rules required of a 14 year old. Parents are also offering a free phone.", "yes but recently could be from 2 weeks to 5 years", "if i were to go back to my fourteen year old self i\u2019d beg them to change schools to save their mental health. and i don\u2019t like kids so i wouldn\u2019t go back and talk to a younger me anyway but thanks i guess", "yes there are bad people. yes there are people who support ed\u2019s and self harm but do you flip it look at all the good on the internet, the people who support your journeys. the people who give you life tips and cleaning tips, the people who introduce you to knew interests and support your current interests. yes there isn\u2019t always good but a lot of it isn\u2019t bad"]}
