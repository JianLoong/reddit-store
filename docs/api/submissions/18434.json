Pay to play, she didn't buy it so doesn't get to monitor.  But choose your battles wisely.   Your mom doesn't trust you, so it will dampen your relationship to not be able to monitor you.

Does your mom have any reason beyond being a helicopter parent to have all these monitoring apps on your phone? That's the only way I see her being justified here morally (though I will note that as your parent she's got some pull as you are a minor, and do live in her house).", "Hard YTA\n\nYou are 14. You should not even have a smartphone, no child (yes CHILD) should. All you need is a basic brick that makes calls and sends texts. \n\nIt is the job of your parents to be parenting you. They are trying to do that. Give up the pixel and or allow your mother to modify it. Under no circumstances should you have unrestricted access to a device like that.", "NTA", "I would do this, but my dad still expects me to pay the service if he buys me a new phone \ud83d\ude05. I payed for it a year in advanxe, so it is payed off until January of next year.", "Exactly", "This is such flawed logic. A smart phone is a luxury, not a necessity - so I don't think it's terrible to have a child pay for their own in some fashion (partially or fully, with cash or by earning in kind around the house or whatever). An iPhone 12 in particular is well above what a 14 year old *needs*, perhaps what they've paid for is an upgrade on what their parents were willing to pay for?\n\nRegardless, internet safety and technological literacy is very real and important. Kids don't get to just buy their way out of being *appropriately* parented. I'm not totally familiar with the apps that their parents want to use or how they work, so I can't judge whether they're also going a bit far with just how much they want to monitor - but some level of monitoring is ok here. Especially things like total screen time and/or what apps are being utilised most heavily as these are both pretty important factors in determining how their child's phone use is likely to impact them, without totally violating privacy (i.e. I don't think they should be able to read every message or text, etc)", "It broke on Monday and I didn't have time all week, and then we went on a trip over labor day weekend. Even if I wanted too, I didn't have time.\n\nI also don't want to spend money to get it fixed and my Google pixel doesn't cost me anything extra.", "No, just no. Teenagers should be allowed to have some sense of privacy, especially if they are paying for the device they use themselves.", "I have been paying for it since i was 13 and I make money doing math tutoring for family friends \ud83d\ude01", "Then it's your product, and not appropriate for them to add conditions to it.\n\nMaybe consider paying for your phone on a separate plan, if possible?\n\nObviously, you should also consider that these are your parents. And, should decide if it's worth the fight. \n\nYou'll only have so many times you can really fight for something with most parents, and so you may want to choose if this is significant enough of a case to make a stink over.", "I also don't know how much this child is being monitored, and I truthfully cannot be the judge of whether the amount is reasonable or not. However, parenting apps can often just raise kids that are crafty (and sometimes distant) enough to get around the boundaries their parents set. Internet safety is very important, but I feel that teaching a child what they need to know to protect themselves and giving them the confidence to get help from their guardians raises a child that is smart enough to carry their own weight when they eventually get too old for that parenting app. I wish I had more time to get resources, but every parent should understand the pros and cons of how they choose to handle internet safety. Not every instance of parents using parenting apps is bad, obviously, but many of them are.", "More interested in your dad offering to buy you a new iPhone. Seems wasteful", "Seconding this! I'm 37f and the closest thing to a 'parenting' app on my phone is the Life 360 app, but that's just because my mom worries a bit. It also helps because my stepdad's got medical issues and I sometimes worry when my mom's on a work trip. They also live out of state and even before we put the app on our phones, they'd sometimes forget to call when coming down for a visit, so this lets me know when they're on their way down.", "I think he is trying to \"bribe\" me into allowing my mom to monitor my phone but he didn't explicitly say that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
