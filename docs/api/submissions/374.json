What\u2019s gotten to me is when we go out we never go to anywhere great, it\u2019s mainly to chain places I\u2019d like to look nice however when they\u2019re out with his lads he likes to go to expensive bars/parties and dress to the 9s but never with me.

But personal story time... My ex was EXACTLY like this. Come to find out, he went out like that \"with the boys\" (over half of them had GFs) so they could all pick up women...\n\nThe only time we went on dates, we didn't even get out of the car.\n\nCommunicate your issue, and if he makes excuses or nothing changes, leave him. Cuz he might be \"out with the boys picking up other women\"\n\nAnd there's nothing stating that you can't have a fanciful dress girls night... Go to a nice resturant dressed to the 9's. If he has a probelm with it... Also take THAT as a sign that he's \"out with the boys picking up women\"", "You are nta and neither is he you just need to communicate how you feel to him", "I would agree if the bf wasn't dressing nicely and going to nice places with his friends... she doesn't have to settle for whatever he gives, that's the point of communication in relationships."]}
