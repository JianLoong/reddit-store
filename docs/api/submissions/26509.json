You unintentionally put her to an asshole test, and she tested positive.", "*<What do I do?>*\n\nWell, stop trying to contact your MIL. She's being petty and childish and DO NOT ENTER her game.\n\nShe'll come around eventually when she notices you're not going to cater her whims and she's missing out on her grandchild while everybody else is bonding with your baby.\n\nNTA\n\nEnjoy the peace while it lasts.", "NTA. In my culture, it used to be frowned upon to take the baby out before it was 40 days old. My dad gave me an earful for not staying at home for said period, but oh, well...", "You did what you thought was best for your son, it's sweet FA to do with your very selfish and childish mother -in-law.\n\nYou've reached out, it's on her now. Don't chase her, don't push it, let her stop sulking and let her make the first move.\n\nIf she doesn't, it's a win for you :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy own mum was all about my daughter but hasn't really bothered with my 2 sons, I see her 2-3 times a year for an hour or two.  We got fed up of telling the kids that nanny was coming to visit only for some BS excuse the morning off, so we don't tell them now. She may be my mother, but with all the hurt and abuse over the years, my family is my wife and kids.", "Congrats, first off! I had one on 7-28-23 myself! My dad just now got to meet him because he's going through chemo. He missed me and my older boys for months because I didn't want to risk it when we were passing something around, then he's born and was still risky so.....we kept them both safe for a month longer. IDK how you could feel wrong at all tbh, I'd slap anyone who wasn't family for telling me that", "NTA. You\u2019re *supposed* to keep newborns inside for a few weeks iirc, to help their immune system develop.\n\nIf your MIL was so desperate to see the baby, surely she could\u2019ve come over instead of insisting you visit her?\n\nYou\u2019re doing all the right things imo.", "NAH: personally I feel you went over the top as there are plenty of ways to keep him safe from bugs but it\u2019s your kid and your decision; OTOH your MIL has a right to be disappointed, especially if this is her first grandchild, she needs to grow up now though", "NTA. Your child comes first and you should not feel bad about doing the right things. I'm pretty sure we didn't take our kids out of the house until after their first rounds of vaccinations and we also imposed a hard rule that anyone visiting had to be fully vaccinated and not sick. My kids are 10 and 12 so that was pre covid and I don't feel bad about any of that.", "NTA - No viruses going around\u2026um Covid is still a thing. Not to mention all the other things that traditionally make a pass through this time of year.\n\nYou\u2019re being selfish because you want you baby to live. You\u2019re stealing her joy. You\u2019re the reason there are now boundaries in place. The only thing that woman had a grip on is the reality she\u2019s fabricated for herself.\n\nYikes. \n\nYou\u2019ve done more than is required of you in your attempt to handle this situation.\n\nShe\u2019s taking a stand like this because she\u2019s accustomed to getting her way when she stomps her feet, screeches, gives people the silent treatment.\n\nYou\u2019ve been so kind in your descriptions of her and it\u2019s probably far kinder than the way she describes you.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate but when you\u2019re the first person to take a stand in a situation like this you\u2019re the one who ends up doing most of the work to establish and keep boundaries.\n\nPeople like this get their way because most people don\u2019t like to argue with them. They\u2019re in fact so opposed to it that often people will try to force the person who\u2019s right to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d.\n\nBut when people behave like this and everyone steadies the boat for them they make absolutely no progress and in fact often get worse over time.\n\nSo I\u2019d enjoy your time without her and she\u2019ll eventually get bored and start a conflict elsewhere where she can be the victor, or she will pop back up and try to act like nothing happened.", "Nta Her petty runs deep but it will eventually run out.  Don't do anything extra, you already tried", "NTA!! Never doubt your decision for the heath of YOUR baby. She\u2019s being a selfish brat.. and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t even give her meeting him a second thought. She\u2019s a grown women throwing a temper tantrum. You do what you want for your baby, and if people can\u2019t respect that, they don\u2019t need to be involved.", "You don't do anything, you never give in to terrorists. Ignore her, if you try and beg now you'll just be telling her that her behavior is ok.", "NTA: your baby doesn\u2019t exist for her enjoyment. It\u2019s a real person with feelings and needs and a brand new immune system.", "This, all of this. I really hope OP sees this comment.\n\nMother-in-law seems like she has main character syndrome. She wanted the birth of the child to be about her. Its not about the child are the parents.", "This, right here, is your answer OP.  \n\nShe is acting like a spoiled child.  You've extended the invitation.  If she doesn't want to come now, that's on her, you have no obligation to fix it and trying to do so will just give her the power.  \n\nI say this not because of this situation, but because of the next 30 situations you'll have with her.  She obviously thinks herself above any rules or boundaries.  She needs to understand that your rules apply to her and she can either comply or be excluded.  \nTrust me on this.  If you backpedal now you'll be regretting it for the rest of your marriage.\n\nNTA", "THIS! Has the vibe of MIL thinking she is #1. She's not. In the last month, I've had Covid, had a coworker with strep (occurance #3 in the last year), another few with Covid, friends with people bringing their children into the office with strep... the list goes on. If she thinks the germs aren't out there, she's very wrong. \n\n You don't need to fix anything. You need to take care of your family and baby (who is still developing an immune system) in the way that best suits you. People can be very careless about illness, and that has not changed, unfortunately. If she can't respect that, that's on her, not you.", "This! Do no beg her. That is what she wants. She wants to you to beg and plead. It will happen again and she will expect the same treatment. Even though you are right.", "I actually thought this was the norm. People were only allow to visit mine after they have been vaccinated for covid, flu and whooping cough, otherwise, they can wait 6 months.", "Right? It sounds like a win to me", "EXACTLY!!!! Let her throw her toddler-like tantrum and enjoy baby without the stress of MIL.", "Yes, this is the answer I was looking for. It may not make a difference in this case but the communication of the boundaries should come from her son, so that it\u2019s clear, even if she chooses to ignore it, that he is setting the conditions in agreement with you. And moving forward he needs to be the one communicating these kinds of things. Again, it may not make a different to MIL but it will help you, OP, to not deal with her tantrums or feel you have done something wrong in how you expressed the boundary.", "Same in my country as well. Honestly I\u2019ve never really visited a newborn baby and I still have a really close bond with my niblings.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

No crowds, that type of thing. \n\nMy doc didn't care about visitors at home as long as it was one or two at a time, and of course wash hands, don't kiss the face etc. \n\nBut all that was already the norm in my family. \n\nConsidering what the world has just went through. Two weeks no visits is really reasonable IMO. Especially since it covered both sides. \n\nHonestly, I had no energy for visits those first two weeks anyway.  5 min to say hi and drop off food was all I had the energy for.", "Just last week we had several appointments call out with a stomach bug. There are always germs and with back to school things tend to spike.", "I gave the most disbelieving laugh at that. Like 5 people I know personally have gotten covid in the last month and three others have had assorted Other Fall Sickness.

There's *plenty* out there.", "Yeah it's not like we've just been though a hideous pandemic.", "I didn't take my babies out anywhere (excpet their Dr appointments) for at least 2 full months.", "I'd be doing the full eight weeks if I had another child today. \n\nMy youngest got RSV and only had contact with his sisters who went to school.
