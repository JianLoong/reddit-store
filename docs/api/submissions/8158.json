Seriously, all these commenters obsessing about her age and relying on \u201cdaddy\u2019s money\u201d just reek of jealousy and contempt.

Another red flag is his initiating this confrontation so assertively in public\u2026 that\u2019s not how to address something that\u2019s concerning you. ANOTHER red flag is the \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d comment when OP was clearly upset that fianc\u00e9 had crossed a line. All of this combined gives OP every right to be upset with fianc\u00e9, and I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s fair that OP\u2019s title suggests she thinks SHE made the scene.

OP set a boundary that she was \u201cpaying\u201d for her own items, regardless of who\u2019s money or actually was, and he disregarded them. \n\nHowever, I can see the fianc\u00e9 not wanting to enter into a marriage when the finances of their partner comes from their dad without exception.
