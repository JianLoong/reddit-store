{"id": 21729, "submission_id": "14ulwkt", "title": "AITA for teaching my daughter self-defense?", "selftext": "throwaway account\r  \n\r  \nI (36f) was involved with an abusive bf when I was younger. I was physically helpless and unable to protect myself. After I had escaped that relationship and eventually began dating again I chose to take self-defense classes and generally became concerned about my physical strength and health. When I had my daughter (15f), I was worried about her safety and ability to defend herself.\r  \n\r  \nWhile she was growing up, I encouraged exercise and taught her about how to avoid dangerous situations (like don't follow a stranger looking for a puppy, don't go along with uncomfortable requests just because an adult makes it, always come to mom or dad if someone acts weird or makes her feel weird) and my husband (34m) fully supported this.\r  \n\r  \nNow that she's 15, my daughter asked to start dating, and my husband said there was no reason to object as long as we met anybody she dated and she still followed curfew. I was much more concerned than he was, but after he brushed off my worries I just went to my daughter and said that she was old enough to begin dating, but I would only agree if she would learn self-defense from me so I know she'll be safe.\r  \n\r  \nShe agreed, and I thought that was it. She began coming to the gym I am a co-owner of after hours to work one-on-one with me on basic self-defense, like escaping different types of holds and strikes to incapacitate an attacker. We've been telling my husband every day we go to the gym and there were no problems.\r  \n\r  \nThis week, though, my husband and I were called to my daughter's school about fighting. Her school has a big problem with students in gangs, and a girl had approached my daughter threateningly and when my daughter didn't respond she grabbed her and started to drag her down. My daughter used defense techniques I had taught her to get out of the hold and struck the girl 4-5 times to get her off of her.\r  \n\r  \nThe school has a 0-tolerance for violence and wanted to expel both my daughter and her attacker, but I argued that she had only acted in self-defense and that it never would have happened if the school took stronger action against gang presence among students. Instead, my daughter and the other girl are suspended for a week (which I still think is absurd) and my husband is now furious with me. He says he didn't know that 'gym days' meant I was teaching our child to fight and he accused me of setting her up to get in trouble by sending the message that violence is okay.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I tried to explain I only taught her self-defense, which is what happened at school, he said we wouldn't be getting calls about our daughter fighting if I didn't project my insecurities onto a child. My daughter is now grounded as well as suspended, and my husband insists there be no more self-defense lessons which would make me uncomfortable with her dating, which isn't fair to her on top of all the other punishment I don't think she deserves.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for teaching her how to fight without my husband knowing?", "created_utc": 1688867715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ulwkt/aita_for_teaching_my_daughter_selfdefense/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re doing a great job preparing her for situations!", ">we wouldn't be getting calls about our daughter fighting if I didn't project my insecurities onto a child.\n\n\nNTA no, but you might be getting calls to the hospital, which is far worse in my opinion. Which would your husband prefer when a system is flawed? The girl clearly was going to attack your daughter either way, this way at least she's seen as less of an easy target.", "NTA. \n\nThese 'non violence' policies are designed to make the victims of violence at school not report it so the school can have a cleaner record. They actively contribute to creating an unsafe environment for the kids just to make their numbers look better on paper.", "NTA your husband is super weird for this. Why on earth would your daughter knowing and using self defense be outrageous and worthy of genuine fury? \n\nI understand being upset at your kid; oftentimes there are solutions that you can control to avoid conflict and teens dont always see or wanna follow the markers. The best defense technique is making sure you never have to use them after all. \n\nBut she was jumped what does he expect her to do?? Get her ass beat? Absolutely not. \n\nAlso why is she still grounded if you are yet to agree on a stance as a unit?", "NTA. I was only 14 when I was sexually assaulted, and I was defenceless against it.

At least that way she could have saved the ' humiliation ' ur husband faced in the school even if it costs her a week in the hospital.\n\n\nU did nothing wrong . A girl should know self defence . It's very much a necessity.\n\n\nNTA.  NTA.  NTA", "Question\n\nIf your daughter had been a son and defended himself against bullies in school as your daughter did would your husband have been proud of a son for knowing how to defend himself or would he have wanted to ground a son for the same behaviour?\n\nVirtually every female I know has esperanced negative experiences in one form or another, and knowing you can defend yourself is better than hoping someone may be able to swoop in and save you if you are in danger.\n\nThe person who chose to attempt harm your daughter could have hurt her and you made sure she had the skills to be safe just like the skills she has knowing how to cross the road when it is safe ect.\n\nOur job as parents is making sure our kids have all the skills they need to survive and thrive.\n\nIf your daughter had been beaten up and it emotionally damaged her would your husband have then blamed you for not teaching your daughter how to protect herself or only thought after she was hurt that maybe it would be a good idea to know how to protect herself.\n\nYou are NTA\n\nYour husband is failing his daughter needs to apologise to her and reverse the grounding, or he will remain the TA.\n\nYour daughter is awesome and should know that you are proud of her for being able to use the skills you taught her.", ">I only taught her self-defense, which is what happened at school, he said we wouldn't be getting calls about our daughter fighting if I didn't project my insecurities onto a child.\n\nno, but he mightve received a call saying your daughter was injured, at the hospital or worst. husband is a huge AH, and yea the school is absurd. punishing young girls for defending themselves is exactly what has been part of the problem for so many years, and your husband is supporting it.

Which to be fair is the vast majority of conflict schools see.\n\nThey are utterly ineffective against predatory behaviour.", ">than be beaten and left in a hospital\n\nwith the zero tolerance policy, she wouldve been beaten and left in a hospital, *and* suspended/expelled for being involved in a fight, wether she defended herself or not. husband needs to rethink his priorities.", "They would still be getting calls about her getting in fights even if she just sat still and did nothing. Zero tolerance policies are stupid", "I had an instructor who boiled this down very simply: \n\n\"It is better to be judged by 12, than to be carried by 8\"", "Probably True tbh the school is the most AH here."]}
