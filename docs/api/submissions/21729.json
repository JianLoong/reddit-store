{"id": 21729, "submission_id": "14ulwkt", "title": "AITA for teaching my daughter self-defense?", "selftext": "throwaway account\r  \n\r  \nI (36f) was involved with an abusive bf when I was younger. I was physically helpless and unable to protect myself. After I had escaped that relationship and eventually began dating again I chose to take self-defense classes and generally became concerned about my physical strength and health. When I had my daughter (15f), I was worried about her safety and ability to defend herself.\r  \n\r  \nWhile she was growing up, I encouraged exercise and taught her about how to avoid dangerous situations (like don't follow a stranger looking for a puppy, don't go along with uncomfortable requests just because an adult makes it, always come to mom or dad if someone acts weird or makes her feel weird) and my husband (34m) fully supported this.\r  \n\r  \nNow that she's 15, my daughter asked to start dating, and my husband said there was no reason to object as long as we met anybody she dated and she still followed curfew. I was much more concerned than he was, but after he brushed off my worries I just went to my daughter and said that she was old enough to begin dating, but I would only agree if she would learn self-defense from me so I know she'll be safe.\r  \n\r  \nShe agreed, and I thought that was it. She began coming to the gym I am a co-owner of after hours to work one-on-one with me on basic self-defense, like escaping different types of holds and strikes to incapacitate an attacker. We've been telling my husband every day we go to the gym and there were no problems.\r  \n\r  \nThis week, though, my husband and I were called to my daughter's school about fighting. Her school has a big problem with students in gangs, and a girl had approached my daughter threateningly and when my daughter didn't respond she grabbed her and started to drag her down. My daughter used defense techniques I had taught her to get out of the hold and struck the girl 4-5 times to get her off of her.\r  \n\r  \nThe school has a 0-tolerance for violence and wanted to expel both my daughter and her attacker, but I argued that she had only acted in self-defense and that it never would have happened if the school took stronger action against gang presence among students. Instead, my daughter and the other girl are suspended for a week (which I still think is absurd) and my husband is now furious with me. He says he didn't know that 'gym days' meant I was teaching our child to fight and he accused me of setting her up to get in trouble by sending the message that violence is okay.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I tried to explain I only taught her self-defense, which is what happened at school, he said we wouldn't be getting calls about our daughter fighting if I didn't project my insecurities onto a child. My daughter is now grounded as well as suspended, and my husband insists there be no more self-defense lessons which would make me uncomfortable with her dating, which isn't fair to her on top of all the other punishment I don't think she deserves.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for teaching her how to fight without my husband knowing?", "created_utc": 1688867715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ulwkt/aita_for_teaching_my_daughter_selfdefense/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask him to do research into the long term mental & physical effects & why he thinks your daughter deserves to suffer like that. \n\nBecause quite frankly he\u2019s putting his discomfort in dealing a phone call over your daughter defending herself at school over his actual daughters health & wellbeing.

Take away his phone and tell him he can only go directly to work and come directly home. Treat him like the child he is acting like. Ask him if he really wants his daughter to show up at your doorstep one day bloodied and bruised because she was beaten by her partner. Ask him if he wants to learn from a police officer that his daughter is dead because of her partner. Really drive it into his thick skull. If he still thinks it's okay for his daughter to get beaten then I'd take a long hard look at the man you married.", "NTA. Your husband needs a jerk to Jesus, frankly.

Plenty of problems with public schools anymore unfortunately. You\u2019d be surprised that many young ladies get trained to protect themselves, in more than one way", "Definitely NTA. Personally, I believe \"zero tolerance\" is bullshit. The school systems use it as an excuse to punish both parties, no matter who started it or acted in self defense, to prevent lawsuits. Your daughter did the right thing defending herself. Honestly, I'd rather be suspended/expelled for defending myself rather than stay in school as a defenseless target for all. Your husband is wrong for punishing her and ignoring you. I wouldn't be surprised if your daughter will soon resent her father for it.", "NTA so your husband would rather his daughter be assaulted at school instead of defending herself b/c let's be honest here and say that is the most likely outcome in that scenario. Also how does your husband explain not needing to be able to protect oneself when alone. I think you need to be asking some hard questions to your husband about how he views the world around his daughter and the reality of the world around his daughter. Maybe looking at crime situations in detail if there is a noticeable gang problem in school than I'm assuming there's a higher than average criminal element around your daughter. \n\nFor clarification I used the phase \"his daughter \" not b/c she's not also your daughter but to illustrate to him that it's not someone's kid it's his own flesh and blood being discussed.", "I stopped counting rape attempts at ten.

Your kid did not start the altercation, and using measured force to escape an attacker is better than taking a beating (and, let's be real, *still* getting punished by the school for \"being in a fight\" even if she went full-gandhi).\n\nI think you might want to make sure your daughter also has some de-escalation and conflict-avoidance strategies in her pocket to reduce the odds of her *needing* to physically defend herself again, but it sounds like she's in a dangerous and violent environment so it may not be *possible* to avoid every conflict. Keep an eye out for retaliation.\n\nI'm going to try very hard to give your husband the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he's only acting like an irrational, victim-blaming jackass because he's scared and trying to feel in control of his kid's safety.  Hopefully he'll pull his head out of his ass soon and be able to articulate how he would have preferred your daughter respond when a girl physically attacked her, so you can start to have a conversation from there.\n\nThis is a battle worth fighting for your daughter though - if his head remains lodged in his ass on this topic, choose your daughter's safety over his sensibilities.", "Are You kidding me? Teaching your daughter self defense is the Best thing You have ever done to her. Honestly, is better to be suspended for defending herself than be beaten and left in a hospital. As for the attackers parents, they should have educated better those kids.\nKeep supporting her.\n\nNTA", "NTA that would be your husband who would have preferred his daughter getting beaten up, hospitalized or even dying depending on the severity. That would be the school district for not taking a tougher stance on gangs in the school.", "NTA. It's a fucked up school that punishes someone for reasonable self defense. You've done your daugher a great favour, and it looks like she's been a good learner. \n\nHubs is being an AH here. I'd continue the lessons in 'stealth' mode.", "NTA Was she supposed to let the other girl beat her up?", "Everyone should know how to fight.", "The school is ridiculous", "NTA your husband is though, he'd prefer your daughter to be assaulted and bullied defensless then be called to school.", "NTA but you shouldn't tie self defense to dating. She should know self defense, period, as well as the appropriate times to employ fighting. Your husband is wrong for not wanting her to defend herself. \n\nYet the school incident was possibly overkill as she had already gotten out of the other girls' grip and didn't necessarily need to put her down (I know in self defense there is an emphasis on incapacitating your attacker long enough to get away, but that's not really applicable to a school tussle.)", "First rule of self defence is to remove yourself from the situation.
