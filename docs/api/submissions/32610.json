That said, it's possible that if he's eating condiments he may have a financial/hunger issue. However, if that's not the case, then he's just a user and you need to let him know that while you may sometimes buy things that he is welcome to, you need to make sure that the things you bring are available for your own lunches and snacks, so unless he's told to help himselves, he needs to make plans to bring his own food.", "Nta - you offered, but you can take back that offer. As conditions change, so must we - adapt. \nIt is okay to change your mind. \n\nI would personally just buy a mini refrigerator, keep it stocked, in my office, and locked when I am not there. That might be easier if you don\u2019t want to have the awkward confrontation .", "ESH.\n\nYTA because you told him to help himself, and since he told you his last manager provided snacks, you can reasonably interpret that he will take free rein on them. \n\nHTA because his mega-consumption, if he knows you are buying them out of your own check, is an AH move.\n\nMany offices provide drinks/snacks. If it is your personal stash, best to keep it someplace a bit more private and just cool down a (marked) item for yourself and keep the rest in a private location (and mark accordingly). \n\nYou also just need to have a chat with him, especially as the manager: \"hey, due to personal reasons I'm no longer stocking snacks or drinks for the office, so please plan on bringing your own supplies from now on. Anything in the fridge that you didn't bring please consider off limits as different people may bring different items.\" Maybe something that you're talking to the owners about providing some snacks/drinks on the company dime.\n\nRegardless, it's not unheard of for people to steal other people's meals, even when it's clearly someone's lunch box. Why this is a thing I am not sure LOL, but there are plenty of memes and ideas on \"discouraging\" future meal-stealers ;)", "NTA\n\nand get a lock for the fridge.", "NTA (just from the title, although I did read the rest). Not that it really matters because he's in the wrong, but you do you have your own fridge in the office and there's another one in the break room? Trying to think of a way you can lock it or put it under your desk or something. I'd be more inclined toward kindness if he hadn't started by letting you know his old manager bought him food.", "NTA.\n\nyou couldn't have expected him to go ham like that. i mean, come on.. you'd think he'd use common sense that he shouldn't just raid the fridge. \n\nalso, if he mentioned his old manager, it probably put you in a tough spot. \n\nfood is getting expensive nowadays and you shouldn't have to be supplying all this food to him on the daily. like if i was taking offered snacks and saw there was one left of something, i would LEAVE it. it's not my food, so i shouldn't eat all of it.\n\nand if i really DID want it, i would ask. \"hey, this is the last ___. do you want it?\" or \"is it okay if i take it?\"\n\nit's just so inconsiderate of him to not even bother. but i guess that's how a lot of people are nowadays. if you give a little, they'll take a lot.\n\ndon't feel bad about retracting your statement. you can say it's been taking a hit at your expenses or something. \n\nor if you really want to give him a second chance, tell him the truth. that you didn't expect him to be taking food left and right, and since he isn't helping to pay for it, you would prefer he limit how much he takes.", "No YWNBTA.   As a manager you have to set clear boundaries in the workplace and he's clearly crossing them.   Most people would know not to take something that isn't theirs but evidently this guy doesn't understand that.", "YTA. You told him to help himself. You fucked up boss.", "YTA on the fact that you\u2019re not using your words. You didn\u2019t want this person to use or take your stuff from the jump. Why offer. You should have seen this coming. But since you didn\u2019t want to put on your big boy/girl pants/dress this is where you are. Next time just say no. Like who wouldn\u2019t have seen this coming with the comments about the past manager\u2026.", "NTA and let him know he needs to bring his own things or atleast restock", "Can you add a lock to the fridge?\n\nNTA either way but definitely communicate to him that he\u2019s taking advantage of you", "ESH.\n\nYou literally told him to help himself, after he was pushing things by suggesting you were expected to supply food because you're a manager (AH/bold). That was a red flag. Then he took it all, making him an AH. Now you want to take your offer back. Not only is that an AH move, but employees do.not.like.it when their boss takes perks away, so you can expect some kind of problems (sloppy work, liwer productivity, etc) from him if you do that.", "Did you make it explicitly clear that you\u2019re stocking the fridge with personal funds, and these aren\u2019t snacks paid for by the company? If not, you really should start there.", "You haven't been clear. He treats it as a work provided perk and you indicated it was fine with you.\n\nYou need to re-set expectations.\n\nYWNBTA but you both need clarity here. You may perish waiting on a man to think about buying your groceries.", "Yeah this is an important lesson for OP in being a good manager.  You can\u2019t be mad at him when you said help yourself especially since he even said he expected the Manager to pay more since they make more.  You have to communicate in a professional manner to put a stop to it.  I wouldn\u2019t be confrontational instead come up with a system.  Label the things that are just for you.  And the non labeled things are for the office but you might still have to contribute to communal items since you started it.", "Because he didn't expect the guy to be a god damn cow and eat literally everything?", "Its a common area for lunches", "Yeah it doesn\u2019t speak well of OP\u2019s managing skills to have to ask Reddit how to manage their employee.  They made a mistake now they have to be the manager in a professional manner.  But still that dude is a glutton for just taking so much food and drink without even considering OP.  Plus this employee already sounds entitled since they mentioned their past manager buying snack items for the office.  Why even mention that to your new manager.  Like he doesn\u2019t sound like a good employee.  Hopefully just a young zoomer without much office experience and not some sloth of a boomer with office experience.", "It is time to say out loud and clearly what your expectations are to your employee, OP.", "Ugh. Can you put a small refrigerator in your own personal space instead?"]}
