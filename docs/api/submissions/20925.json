I'm 21F now and somewhat taking a break to focus on school. I've known my friend 21F (she is 5'5, midsized, and looks like your average person important for later) for a few months now and the topic of modeling came up. It came up that I used to model full time and just recently slowed down for school. She asked what agency I'm with and I told her the name; and told me that she wanted to join that agency and do high fashion work and how lucky I was. I shrugged and told her good for her but she noticed something was up and asked why I was acting like that. I told her it was nothing but she kept pushing and pushing till I told her modeling isn't all fun and games.\r  \n\r  \nI told her the truth about the industry and how toxic it is. How on the outside it looks like it's changed but it hasn't. How I've been harassed by agents for my hip measurements being 35.7 instead of 35 and constantly being rejected for things out of my control. I also told her about the pay and how it isn't this huge paycheck right after but very random and there were months I had to stretch the paycheck or get an advance for a smaller amount for fee's. When I told her there were covers/shows I've done for pay in exposure she didn't believe me and called me a liar. She then goes on to talk about Lily Rose Depp/Kendall Jenner and how they get paid millions for their work. I told her they are firstly nepo babies and secondly the top 1% of the industry and it can take the most amazing model years to get there if they even get that lucky. She kept saying that isn't true and those girls just aren't good models and how once she gets there she'll make it to that level.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where I snapped and told her she's not even tall enough or unique for runway work. She once again brought up Lily Rose Depp and how she's walked for Chanel multiple times even though she's short. I once again told her to remember who her parents are and the connections she has. She then said the industry isn't like that anymore. This is where I went off and said the industry hasn't changed like that. That there still isn't a market for petite midsize girls and she isn't big enough for plus size modeling but not small enough either. I mentioned how if they made such a fuss about a .7 difference in my hips why would they care about her. She has no connections to help her on the runway and she is a normal person and that commercial work is the only chance she has at modeling. After this she called me a jealous hater and stormed off.\r  \n\r  \nShe hasn't talked to me since. This is where I feel like im the ahole for being so harsh and telling her that she'd fail in hf and that her only chance at success is with commercial modeling. I asked another friend and she said I should have just went along with what she was saying even though I knew she was completely wrong", "created_utc": 1688066134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mdol7/aita_for_telling_my_friend_shes_too_basic_to_be_a/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes its best to be honest and brutal about it.  Modelling is a grotesque industry that is very harsh to people and you just scratched the surface at what she might encounter.", "NTA. You know the industry, she doesnt. Maybe talking about her looks was a bit much, but it sounds like you were just giving professional advice, albeit a little harshly.", " \nNTA she wanted to argue with you about something you have experience in, where she does not. Sounds like she needed a reality check.", "NAH. You were right giving your honest opinion about this. The truth hurts, and a natural response to being hurt, is getting angry at the person who caused the hurt.\n\nIf she is your friend and you want to be a good friend, tell her you are sorry for hurting her feelings, and you will support her if she really wants to become a model. Tell her you hope she proves you wrong. Give her advice on how to get started, making a portfolio and applying to an agency (or whatever it is one does to become a model, i have no clue how that works). And NEVER say \"i told you so\", go with some variation of \"oh man, that sucks\"", "ESH.\n\nSmile and say, \u201cOh, good luck.  The agency has a good rep.\u201d\n\nShrugging and changing your demeanor enough that she noticed you seem to have more to say opened up this whole can of worms. \n\nAlso seems like she was itching to prove you wrong.", "NTA.

And she\u2019s an AH for that.\n\nI think you were good in sharing what you\u2019d experienced. But that kind of fell off at the end, no need to attack her, just shrug and say \u201call the power to you, hope it works out great for you!\u201d And move on. Sticking the point home was. A little over the top and a little AH\u2019ish on your end, too.\n\nSo I guess ESH", "NTA, I was once told by a wise woman, the truth always hurts. It either hurts the person being told the truth, the person telling the truth, often times both.", "ESH, but you only mildly OP.\n\nI understand how annoying and challenging it is to speak to someone so stubbornly clueless but you could have ended it with a simple \"fair enough, wish you all the best\" and left it at that.\n\nOh well, now time to let her spread her wings and see how she does in the modelling world.", "Yeah you were a little harsh but also your friend seemed a little stubborn and arrogant, it wasn\u2019t like you were doing it out of malice just warning her plus she having that idea of \u201cI\u2019ll be able to make it to the top 1%\u201d seemed kinda unrealistic unfortunately \nSo probably NTA", "YTA truth is, Reddit does t believe you are a model.

Sometimes you just can't help but be harsh to people that are this delusional.", "YTA Although only because of *how* you worded your responses. Honestly it seems like you were trying to spare your friend the pain of failure but you could have been a little more supportive. I think you could have voiced your concerns without straight up insulting her. Now that being said i don't think what you said was wrong more so of how you said it. You have experience in this industry so your word should hold a little more weight, but some people have to fail all by themselves. I'd suggest that you call up your friend and apologize, tell her that you are only looking out for her because if she thinks you were mean, than she has no idea what she's in for. But i would if i were you offer some tips that helped you succeed in your field, who knows maybe there will be a Christmas miracle and her career takes off or maybe you get to show your friend that you still care about her regarless. At the end of the day she could fail at traditional modeling and use your tips to make it on Instagram or something similar.", "YTA  - You lack restrain. Your shrug explanation could have been one comment but you opened a box of opinions. She did not say, \"Tell me about the industry.\" Your sharing was to build up your accomplishments, validate your knowledge of the industry, and put her down for her current views.  Not a good look.", "[deleted]", "YTA how does it benefit to shit on her dreams? Maybe she will fail, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should actively discourage her from trying", "Slight YTA.\n\nYou were definitely right to give your friend good advice about the career, and to warn her she might face abuse and harassment.  \n\nYou crossed the line when you insulted her beauty and looks.  You might even be right about it, but let her find out for herself.  Insulting a friend's looks and body is AH behavior in my opinion.  (Even in a conversation where those same looks are also qualifications for a job.)", "Yta look you told her your experiences- that was fine!  That was helpful!\n\nShitting on her looks was not helpful. She's going to go in and have scouts and managers do it.  She'll either get thr memo or not.", "YTA. This comes off a little \u201cgate-keep-y\u201d. The way you spoke to her gives off \u201cI\u2019m good looking and successful at being a model, and you aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t even try\u201d vibes. It\u2019s more common now in marketing for Target, Old Navy etc. to have more \u201caverage\u201d looking people model rather than supermodels. She might not get the high end runway gigs but anyone can be a model these days.", "Esh. You because you picked on her looks and her dream. Her because she thinks she knows more about an industry than someone who is actually in it. \n\nIf the friend were a man everyone here would say she was mansplaining the modeling industry to op", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's delusional, and while you could have just let reality kick her ass, you tried to save her some time and embarrassment.", "ESH, but you get a very soft AH. She should not have invalidated you, and was being a jerk by ignoring your experiences/belittling them. She was being the bigger AH. But you could have simply given her a shrug, and told her to go for it if she felt so strongly. You should not have brought in her appearance.", "One of the greatest ills of social media is how everyone thinks they have what it takes to model and be an \"influencer.\" This is somewhat exacerbated by mall stores who call their salespeople \"models.\" I get that OP was trying to be truthful with her friend. Unfortunately, this friend is just going to have to learn the hard way that she doesn't have what it takes.", "I guess you could have let her go to the agency and have them tell her she\u2019s too short. They have no problem telling you that you\u2019re not enough. They would have been way more upfront than you. Hell, I had an agent tell me \u201cwell, you\u2019re kinda short\u201d when I told her that I was 5\u20197\u201d and was looking for a new agent for print and acting (both of which I had done) because my previous agent wasn\u2019t doing anything.

Someone's gotta make it big without being a nepo baby and not fitting the mold. Why not her. Just believe in her. You can be brutally honest about the industry and tell her exactly what she did and the odds of making it, but you don't have to tell her SHE won't make it. She'll make it or she won't. It's good to face rejection, it builds character. Let her try and fail, don't discourage her from trying.", "NTA\n\nBeing that you are in the industry, I would say you know better than she does and is getting offended over hearing a friend say what she is realistically going to hear from complete strangers at casting calls.", "Esh", "The entire industry is more than a little harsh.

I just shrug comments off and say good for you to people and that's usually the end of it. It just rubs me the wrong way when people make these comments on things they have no clue about. It's like me acting like I know everything about engineering when I've never worked in that field. You're definitely right about keeping my trap shut for the most part it is just easier and causes less stress for me", "Even I know there is a huge difference between high fashion and print models.", "\u201cwhat if someone had told Kurt Cobain he couldn't model!\u201d\n\nWhat the fuck?", "The places you listed are \u201ccommercial\u201d model jobs.. the friend was aiming more for a louis vuitton or channel or Dior kinda vibe\u2026.", "I actually just deleted my comment because even anonymously, my sense is that it\u2019s going to attract comments I just don\u2019t want to deal with. \n\nI do want to let you know though that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude, and I understand how comments like that can get under a person\u2019s skin. I have zero social media now that I don\u2019t have to keep it up for work for this very reason. \n\nI think a good comparison for the people not understanding is this: how would you react if you spent years learning an industry, only for random people to badger you with totally incorrect assumptions about that line of work and disregard any factual comments you make based on your experience? You wouldn\u2019t like it, and I\u2019d imagine you\u2019d be irritated. \n\nPeople can be unbelievably presumptuous about these jobs, so I get it when I see young people who are primed to take it a bit personally, which is what happened here. \n\nBut yes, it\u2019s better to say nothing, especially when you feel your eyes beginning to roll out of your skull.", "[deleted]", "Yeah.. I was dumbfounded by that as well.", "She doesn't want to do commercial work like I suggested to her, she wants to exclusively work in high fashion where there currently isn't a market for her. As of now hf has no market for her, you're either skinny or plus sized. To me saying she isn't unique didn't feel like a dig because I'm used to words like that but I see how it comes off as a dig. I don't see anything wrong with being average the majority of the population is but that's not what most hf agencies are looking for, they want unique/weird features. The models under 5'7 walking runways almost always are nepo models or have connections that she doesn't.\n\nThe campaigns with multiple types of models is commercial work and it pays much better than hf. There aren't nearly as many requirements as hf but there is no runway work. She doesn't want to do ecom work she wants to walk for Chanel and be the cover of Vogue"]}
