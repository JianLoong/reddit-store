I'm 21F now and somewhat taking a break to focus on school. I've known my friend 21F (she is 5'5, midsized, and looks like your average person important for later) for a few months now and the topic of modeling came up. It came up that I used to model full time and just recently slowed down for school. She asked what agency I'm with and I told her the name; and told me that she wanted to join that agency and do high fashion work and how lucky I was. I shrugged and told her good for her but she noticed something was up and asked why I was acting like that. I told her it was nothing but she kept pushing and pushing till I told her modeling isn't all fun and games.\r  \n\r  \nI told her the truth about the industry and how toxic it is. How on the outside it looks like it's changed but it hasn't. How I've been harassed by agents for my hip measurements being 35.7 instead of 35 and constantly being rejected for things out of my control. I also told her about the pay and how it isn't this huge paycheck right after but very random and there were months I had to stretch the paycheck or get an advance for a smaller amount for fee's. When I told her there were covers/shows I've done for pay in exposure she didn't believe me and called me a liar. She then goes on to talk about Lily Rose Depp/Kendall Jenner and how they get paid millions for their work. I told her they are firstly nepo babies and secondly the top 1% of the industry and it can take the most amazing model years to get there if they even get that lucky. She kept saying that isn't true and those girls just aren't good models and how once she gets there she'll make it to that level.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where I snapped and told her she's not even tall enough or unique for runway work. She once again brought up Lily Rose Depp and how she's walked for Chanel multiple times even though she's short. I once again told her to remember who her parents are and the connections she has. She then said the industry isn't like that anymore. This is where I went off and said the industry hasn't changed like that. That there still isn't a market for petite midsize girls and she isn't big enough for plus size modeling but not small enough either. I mentioned how if they made such a fuss about a .7 difference in my hips why would they care about her. She has no connections to help her on the runway and she is a normal person and that commercial work is the only chance she has at modeling. After this she called me a jealous hater and stormed off.\r  \n\r  \nShe hasn't talked to me since. This is where I feel like im the ahole for being so harsh and telling her that she'd fail in hf and that her only chance at success is with commercial modeling.

You have experience in this industry so your word should hold a little more weight, but some people have to fail all by themselves. I'd suggest that you call up your friend and apologize, tell her that you are only looking out for her because if she thinks you were mean, than she has no idea what she's in for.

The models under 5'7 walking runways almost always are nepo models or have connections that she doesn't.\n\nThe campaigns with multiple types of models is commercial work and it pays much better than hf.

You could have just told her of some of the downs about modeling and what has happened to you.  She might not do well at your agency, but there are many others out there and there are more models out there today of all shapes and sizes.  While I think those like Kendall Jenner, Hailey Bieber, etc are beautiful, let\u2019s face it, most of the world will never fit into the fashions they model.  Who actually buys them?

The rest were told that \u201cyour look is too strong,\u201d meaning that they weren\u2019t attractive enough to be considered. \n\nAnother agent wouldn\u2019t consider anyone under 5\u20199\u201d and told a 22-year-old that she was \u201ctoo old\u201d to start a modeling career.

However, she\u2019d almost certainly get a massive ego blow.\n\nOne woman I know who is very pretty was told she\u2019d never get work because her left eyebrow is slightly crooked.

Good on you for being smart and realistic and self aware. \n\nI got denied jobs because I didn\u2019t show certain photographers and casting directors my dick. \n\nAlso NTA", "This is like when a doctor with years of education and experience is told be some random dweeb that reading a Facebook article means they know just as much about medicine.", "Soft ESH\n\nI don't disagree with anything you said to her about the modeling industry, but it sounds like she just made a simple comment about wanting to get signed by the same agency and do high fashion work. \n\nIf you had just said, 'oh small world, good luck' instead of shrugging and 'good for you', which was a little passive-aggressive, she probably wouldn't have questioned that response. *If* she then asked you about your experience in the industry and had the same responses to what you said, then only she'd be the AH. But I don't think your initial response was warranted for a conversation between 'friends', and that's the reason for the AH judgment. \n\nBut she's also an AH for not believing what you said about the industry and your experiences. Just based off her height alone, it'd be incredibly difficult for her to break into high fashion (or even commercial unless it's a petite-focused brand).", "NTA. Your friend lives in Delulu Land. If she wants to be a model let her try. She is entitled to that. But if she faces difficulties in the future then at least she can't say you didn't warn her.", "I had a similar experience to you with the industry being toxic but short people can get contracts as long as they are looking on the right place so that was a lie. YTA. Anyone can be a model as long as they are looking in thier markets. I had a friend who was 5'2 and she got multiple contracts in Japan. I've known older models and heavier models who have also gotten enough work to be considered successful.", "NTA but honestly you gave her the warning, she can see for herself if that's for her.", "Should have gone - not should have went", "NTA\n\nBut if she *really* wants to model, just as a hobby & get some cash (& I'm just talking a hundred a picture & don't expect more than a few pictures), she might look at private hair salons, clothing stores, beauty salons, etc, who need models for their websites or competitions. \n\nObviously I never got into the industry, but that's how I modeled. I never wanted to make it big, but it was something I enjoyed doing. It also helped with my years between high school & uni. You don't necessarily have to have the model look, especially if you're modeling hair & makeup, so that might help her since she's petite.", "If you were a lawyer and she basically told you she could pass the bar without having the 6-7 years of education it takes, the reaction would be the same. \n\nYou told her she can do commercials. That\u2019s how I complement people. You could sell shampoo etc. I do not know who you hang out with but that\u2019s a very odd reaction. I don\u2019t know. Maybe she was fishing for your help and now that she know she isn\u2019t getting it, she is ghosting you?\n\nAnywho. NTA", "God lord I'm glad your not my friend. YTA .", "NTA- she should have some humility. Then to claim you are jealous! Of what? Her non-existent career? This girl was jealous of you and never had any interest in being a model. She probably never even thought about it before meeting you and was just talking out her ass. Your friend who thinks you should bullshit, tell her that you are too authentic and mature to play into silly delusions. Then smile and say, \"but I used to be like that.\" And give her shoulder a little squeeze so she knows you pity her.", "NTA. Best of luck in school!", "I think everyone sucks here, but your friend more so. You did say some not-nice things when your friend did not listen, but she didn't exactly say anything mean to you. That being said, even if it wasn't *mean*, your friend was an asshole for not backing off when you told her to. If this was a professional setting, I would 100% say NTA because you (presumably) didn't say anything untrue, but in a casual friendship setting, you were a little harsh.", "You may have been harsh, but it was called for because she was literally saying you didn\u2019t know what you were talking about, or were outright lying, about the industry you\u2019ve been working in for the last five years. NTA.", "Info: What was the reason for the original reluctance? Why did your friend have to push you to tell her that the modelling industry is still toxic?", "I watched a Ted talk by a model once, where she commented that saying your career plan is to become a model is like saying your career plan is to win the lottery. Yes, great if it works out, but almost entirely determined by factors that you have literally no ability to affect.", "NAH I would have also been as harsh lmao.", "As an actor who deals with similar stuff NTA.\n\nI've had similar \"you're 1 tenth of an inch to short for this\" kinda crap and issues with wardrobe etc just flat out not reading my size card.\n\nIf someone thinks the entertainment industry is a get rich quick scheme they are wrong. Telling them such is not wrong imo.\n\nIf everyone who wanted to get rich quick but didn't have a passion for entertainment didn't join the industry  then most people who do have thay burning passion for it and are genuinely good at it would actually have more consistency with their work as you wouldn't have a million ppl who are going to quit jn 2 years taking the opportunity from people who actually like the career.", "Yeah, I see how that was harsh now. I'm used to the way agents and people in the industry talk so I didn't see how it would hurt her but I get how it comes across now to people not used to it. I see nothing wrong with looking average the majority of people are and there's nothing wrong with that. High fashion agencies tend to look for unique/\"weird\" features that aren't common, there's a lot of features they look for that people wouldn't consider conventionally attractive but they still want them. Beauty is subjective at the end of the day and I in no way think she's ugly", "I'm sorry about your experience it really is such a toxic industry. I've always loved fashion and that is the only thing that has kept me in it", "Yeah, this was a convo between friends, not career day. OP\u2019s right about the industry, but it all could have been said less bluntly, and in a way that didn\u2019t come off as \u201cYou\u2019re too ugly to do what I do.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong, OP, but YTA.", "She obviously did, since the friend wouldn't accept literal facts that OP were stating.\n\nSaying \"No you are wrong\" to someone who literally has worked in the business warrants some harsh truths imo.\n\nNTA", "You're thinking of commercial work which she does not want to do. Commercial work is inclusive and anyone can become a model in it. She wants to do high fashion and only with big agencies; it is not a lie that she will not get signed by the agencies she wants being 5'5 without any contacts or a huge following. The hf industry has barely changed, we have plus models now but no market for midsize girls", "Thank you!", "Honestly, I doubt it. If she was trying for high fashion, some assistant would have laughed her out the building before she got to the casting agent.", "Won't name but a certain big agency does a great job of getting nepo models/influencers jobs but neglects the \"lower\" status models. High fashion doesn't pay well and is full of nepotism", "Depends. C student as a high school or freshman/sophomore undergrad student? Sure, there's still enough time left to turn it around and show a straight A streak in their transcripts. C student as a junior or senior in undergrad? Forget it. Too late and unrealistic for med school admissions.", "I told her about commercial modeling but she doesn't want any part of it, she only wants to do high fashion modeling", "Yup, I\u2019m not even necessarily calling op TA but she\u2019ll be better off to learn not to engage with people who are hellbent on being wrong or contrarian. Once you realize you\u2019re getting dragged in to something like this, just say okay and move on. (Not saying that\u2019s super easy either but if someone\u2019s going to get upset no matter what you say or do, save yourself the time and frustration and leave).", "You're right that's why I said if they are looking on the appropriate markets. Not all agencies only work in the western markets and places that have western beauty standards.", "I'm used to the way agents and people in the industry talk so I didn't see how it would hurt her but I get how it comes across now to people not used to it. High fashion agencies tend to look for unique/\"weird\" features that aren't common, there's a lot of features they look for that people wouldn't consider conventionally attractive but they still look for them. I suggested commercial work to my friend since it is more inclusive and pays way better but she doesn't believe it is real modeling and only wants to do hf", "Nah they can still do it. They\u2019d just have to get a masters and work their ass off. People are capable of a lot. You have to be really careful about whether or not something really is an unattainable goal or if that\u2019s just your opinion before you crush someone\u2019s dreams.", "I don't like talking about modeling I hate when it's brought up but since my Instagram is public I can't really hide it from people.  I just shrug comments off and say good for you to people and that's usually the end of it. It just rubs me the wrong way when people make these comments on things they have no clue about. It's like me acting like I know everything about engineering when I've never worked in that field. I tend to bottle everything up and sometimes I snap but I'm working on it", "That's why I tried shrugging the whole thing off, I've seen the industry destroy girls I've lived with and it broke my heart. Whenever people think the industry is all fun and games it really rubs me the wrong way and I just try to keep my mouth shut as much as I can", "I feel you, I wish you luck in whatever you decide to pursue!", "Oh, absolutely! I definitely don\u2019t want to diminish how rude and infuriating her behavior was."]}
