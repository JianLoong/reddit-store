While it's understandable that yes she signed a lease with you and you expected her to cover her portion until the end of the lease, something came up. you as a partner should understand and be supportive of what she needs to do. There are several different thing that could have happened causing her to not be able to pay her side of the rent, such as losing a job, being injured or otherwise being out of work. Did you have a plan for those situations? I've lived with strangers many times and most turned out to be good friends of mine. Don't be so selfish and get a damn roomate I mean seriously what if you broke up, did you plan this at all were you just going to keep living together broken up?", "YTA you're ignoring the burden of taking care of family, specifically elderly. It is going to SUCK for your GF. If she's able to pay I know I would hope that my own SO would continue to pay rent but it's hard to tell whether she can. Having a roommate is not bad compared to that and if she's unable to afford to keep paying a share.\n\nTake a second and consider your gf and her new situation, seems like she'd only spend a small amount of time at your apartment, no sleeping over most likely, so she's paying rent for the privilege to see you. \n\nDoes it suck...sure...but you're staring down the barrel of \"am I the kind of guy who can't adapt to new situations and force my GF to breakup with me during her family crisis\"?", "YTA. but what are you going to do when your soon to be ex GF stops paying her half of the rent?

She wants to be there for her family and you're refusing to lift a finger to accommodate or support her in anyway.  It's not her fault her grandmother needs help for awhile nor is it her fault you can't afford the apartment on your own.  Life happens and if you want a quality girl in your life you better be able to be understanding.

She should definitely break up with you. You think she should subsidise your living arrangements while taking care of someone who needs her.

If she were living on her own she couldn't just decide to stop paying rent to help her grandma. It sucks, but it's life. That's a binding agreement.\n\nPersonally, I would not want to live with a roommate other than a partner either. I have gone to great lengths to live in places I could afford to make sure that I can be on my own. That's meant far away neighborhoods with long commutes, small spaces, not super great neighborhoods, you name it. So I understand where you're coming from.  Perhaps the best solution is to figure out how much it would cost to break the lease and split it between you two. Then you could find a place you can afford on your own.", "YTA.  Your gf is going to live farther away than she prefers, caring for her grandmother out of love and concern.  She isn\u2019t getting some great deal where she\u2019s now rolling in dough.  Life happens and we adapt.  Legally, you can\u2019t expect her to pay for a year, lease or not.  You both have to \u201cmitigate damages\u201d by looking for suitable replacements.  Doesn\u2019t matter if that\u2019s not your preference\u2014her first choice wasn\u2019t being her grandmother\u2019s caretaker, either.

Or see what the landlord says the cost is of breaking the lease\u2014they cannot continue charging you once the unit is re-rented, but re-read that lease.

I\u2019m not holding out a lot of hope for this relationship.", "YTA, and she should break up with you. \n\nSometimes emergencies happen in life. An elderly grandparent falling, breaking a hip, and requiring care for 2ish years isn't her ducking out on responsibilities. It's her stepping up to be responsible for her family. \n\nYou are trying to leech off your soon to be ex, refuse to even vaguely attempt to find a roommate, and are sabotaging her families care and her financial wellness in the process. You can't force her to live with you and you can't force her to subsidize you. \n\nI hope she formally files to break the lease (usually sacrafices' deposit and two months rent)... But also is going to save her money and kicks your butt to the curb where you're going to have to find a roommate anyway. And breaking a lease on the grounds of family medical emergency is usually one of those tenants rights peices in most places. \n\nYou're a huge AH. And you're essentially ending this relationship in the worst possible way in the process.\n\nEdit: and in the comments she's willing to get a sublet and you refuse to agree to live with anyone she finds....

She\u2019s not taking that route at all . Op wants her to keep paying her half while he gets the whole place all to himself because he doesn\u2019t want a roommate. Well she doesn\u2019t want her grandmother to be in this situation or have another fall leaving her alone on the ground without any assistance for hours again. \n\nAlso it\u2019s ludicrous that he\u2019s just assuming that because she\u2019s not paying her grandmother rent she has no other expenses- home care assistance/ saving up for nursing home care for grandma, she still needs to eat so that\u2019s an additional new expense, she\u2019s likely going to have to pay additional for utilities / better wifi if she\u2019s full time wfh, added transport costs to visit bf / friends because she\u2019s moving an hour away, and not to mention the additional uncompensated  time and effort she has to expend caring for her grandmother while also working full time. There is absolutely an uncaring and selfish unsupportive partner in this relationship but it is not op\u2019s gf", "She wants him to find a roommate but he's refusing. She's not asking him to take the whole cost, he just doesn't want a roommate", "In his comments he said she tried to look for roommate but he won't allow any roommate in as he doesn't want to live with strangers", "Well, then she loses nothing by paying until you get a roommate. But you need to free her from the lease. It\u2019s a year or more she won\u2019t be able to live with you, through no fault of her own. That\u2019s too long to be paying for a place she doesn\u2019t own and can\u2019t live in.. And if she dumps you because you\u2019re not pulling your socks up and helping her deal with the crappy hand life is dealing her right now (as a good partner does) you\u2019ll be finding a roommate anyway.\n\nApart from anything else, this could be an opportunity for her to save up, as few young people get. So help her make the best of it, by making the best of it yourself.", "But what happens to the roommate when she wants to move back in? This could be weeks or years. He needs to break the lease entirely and downsize to something he can afford.", "I don't see any of his comments that said she was looking for the roommate.", "She loses a lot by paying for this asshole who admits that he would just squat in the apartment if his gf breaks the lease \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nShe needed to break up with him (and broken the lease) yesterday", "Yeah, I guess you didn\u2019t read the whole thing. That\u2019s cool."]}
