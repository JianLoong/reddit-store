There are several different thing that could have happened causing her to not be able to pay her side of the rent, such as losing a job, being injured or otherwise being out of work. Did you have a plan for those situations? I've lived with strangers many times and most turned out to be good friends of mine.

If she were living on her own she couldn't just decide to stop paying rent to help her grandma. It sucks, but it's life. That's a binding agreement.\n\nPersonally, I would not want to live with a roommate other than a partner either. I have gone to great lengths to live in places I could afford to make sure that I can be on my own. That's meant far away neighborhoods with long commutes, small spaces, not super great neighborhoods, you name it. So I understand where you're coming from.  Perhaps the best solution is to figure out how much it would cost to break the lease and split it between you two. Then you could find a place you can afford on your own.", "YTA.

An elderly grandparent falling, breaking a hip, and requiring care for 2ish years isn't her ducking out on responsibilities. It's her stepping up to be responsible for her family. \n\nYou are trying to leech off your soon to be ex, refuse to even vaguely attempt to find a roommate, and are sabotaging her families care and her financial wellness in the process. You can't force her to live with you and you can't force her to subsidize you. \n\nI hope she formally files to break the lease (usually sacrafices' deposit and two months rent)... But also is going to save her money and kicks your butt to the curb where you're going to have to find a roommate anyway.

In some places all parties on the lease are responsible for the full rent. I lived in a place with some friends, we were all on the lease. The lease didn't spell out what each individual rent was, just a total month rent . If the landlord didn't receive the full amount we all would be evicted. Any disagreement between us roommates would have to be settled in civil court after the fact. So it could be GF doesn't pay, OP pays her share and tries to sue her for recompense, or OP finds a new place, or gets a roommate.", "What KipsBay said isn't necessarily true because you don't know what the terms of the lease are. But I think you missed the point that functionally (regardless of legally) OP may need to find a roommate if he doesn't want to cover the full amount because the gf may just stop paying.\n\nIt is a real possibility that she breaks up with him and quits paying her portion of rent and OP will have to cover the full amount to avoid the landlord taking legal action against them both. If OP pays all rent to avoid legal action by the landlord, OP could take her to small claims court to recover but that could take months. So OP does not functionally have as much leverage as he legally does right now. He should prepare to pay all rent, get a roomie, or have legal action taken against him.", "If her name is on the lease, then she has as much ownership in talking to the landlord to inform landlord she intends on ending her tenancy and they should proceed with finding a roommate for OP to maintain their rent payment or OP to buy out both bedspaces. \n\nOP was the person who declined on behalf of his gf to let rhe landlord look for a subletter. Which they offered to do, presumably because they are a human being and understand the need of a person to live with an elderly grandparent that needs people around for safety. \n\nSure legally OP can completely refuse a sublet (he has to sign the lease change too) and legally his GF owes half the rent cost to the landlord.

He can't just do nothing and make her pay for the remainder of the lease.\n\nSimilar to breaking a lease. The landlord can ask you to pay rent until the house is released, but the landlord has to take reasonable steps to ensure this happens as quickly as possible. They can't just take money and leave the house empty until the end of the lease.", "Agreed. \n\nIf OP signed a year lease with this woman, I assume he is/was thinking this could be a prelude to marriage.

I mean, if it were me I would approach it from the perspective of how can we best support everyone?

She'll be better off with someone who's less selfish. You even told your landlord you wouldn't take her off the lease. GOD YOU'RE AN A-HOLE ON THIS ONE.

And considering his attitude , losing this boyfriend wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.\n\nA decent guy would find her willingness to take care of her family a great character trait in a partner", "My grandmother also had a nasty fall that made her dementia so much worse. She's still here 5 cruel years later and her good days are getting ever rarer. Now looking back, a broken hip at the time would have been a mercy :c", "Fucking boss, your mom and grandma <3", "u/Famous_Orchi is a comment stealing bot - all its comments are copied from elsewhere in the thread.

He can\u2019t afford the place alone, and good luck not only finding a roommate for a temporary, but unknown amount of time, but getting the apartment manager to agree to this.  OP can\u2019t just take her off.  He has to qualify on his own or with another roommate, and IF another person goes on the lease, then GF CAN\u2019T come back.\n\nIf my husband\u2019s mom has an emergency and we need to rush to her to help her, the bank isn\u2019t going to accept us not paying for our home.", "Her stepping in to help isn\u2019t the relationship ender, OPs lack of empathy and support is.", "Reddit has many  people who haven't had to take responsibility for the well being of another human. It skews pretty young if I am remembering correctly. It smacks of the kid who gets off on being technically right in class. The subreddit especially can be wildly judgemental about lives and decisions they never had to make and circumstances they have never been in.", "Wish I could give hearts. My gram was taking care of my Pap who was getting dementia. She had a heart attack and he was found wandering outside with a note in his pocket that said 'get an asprin'.(My uncle lived down the hill.)  She died and we realized his dementia was much more advanced than she'd let on and he needed a high level of care and she'd been doing it all. \n\nFuck dementia.", "People like you that think rental agreements are more important than people are what\u2019s wrong with this world.", "Yea the fact that he's so focused on her getting to live rent free as if she's getting gifted something when in reality she is likely disrupting her job and taking on additional expenses to be a caretaker during a family emergency is... Not the look of a supportive partner.", "Yep, this is AITA, not Am I Legally Correct. He states he plans to squat and tank both their credit and permantly prevent himself from getting future housing solely to trap her in the relationship and rental agreement. That's abusive. He's the AH", "> Since OP is saying their gf is on the lease, I assume that means they both signed the lease together rather than having signed separate leases - the important bit in that is (depending on the lease) it likely means that op and their gf are legally a single party in regards to the lease\u2026 which also means that one of them can\u2019t unilaterally decided to make changes to the lease without the second.\n> \n> Basically, the gf is stuck on the lease for the remainder assuming op doesn\u2019t agree - it also means that they can\u2019t terminate the lease agreement early without permission. Even if early termination was allowed under the lease, the gf likely would not be able to terminate the lease unilaterally.\n> \n> There\u2019s not much the gf can do to avoid the potential of an eviction in this scenario other than pay if op doesn\u2019t agree to a change and refuses to pay more than half.\n\nThe key point is that if they both signed the lease together, she doesn't actually need to pay the landlord - especially if she moves an hour away and OP is the one left. Landlord can go after OP for the full amount of missed/due rent and then OP will have to sue his ex in small claims to try and recoup her half.\n\n> I\u2019d also wager the gf is unable to sublet, but that\u2019s more speculation\u2026 I haven\u2019t seen many leases that allow it in the real world since landlords usually like to maintain control over who lives there.\n\nThis is very location-based. In your location they might be rare \"in the real world\", but in mine the tenant always has the right to assign the lease to anyone they can find and if the landlord refuses the tenant can end the lease early with 30 days notice.", "Yeah, that's a super valid point. It's an easy conversational trap to fall into on this subreddit.", "That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. Refusing to find a roommate.", "Oh, check his comments. He plans to squat when he inevitably gets evicted over it", "Won\u2019t this depend on 1- if the OP is willing to get HIMSELF evicted to spite his soon to be ex 2 if the landlord decides to go after her for the lease agreement? I\u2019m asking as I don\u2019t know.", "Even in one of the biggest cities in this psychopathically capitalist hellscape every lease I ever signed or worked on as part of my job had the option to break it, and in most cases the responsibility was just to cover the rent until the landlord found a new tenant. \n\nEveryone is here hemming and hawing about \"legal obligations\", but IMO the real issue is OP demonstrating that he doesn't have his girlfriend's back when a family emergency arises. If it were just the girlfriend on the lease, or the girlfriend and a roommate, she'd have options for breaking the lease with less of a penalty than OP wants to enforce, and that probably feels terrible coming from a person who is supposed to care about you. What does moving an hour away and becoming her grandmother's caretaker mean for her job and income? Has OP even considered that maybe she won't be able to afford the next 7 months of rent? And again, if she were in this situation alone or with a roommate, she most likely would not have to, so OP is making this situation worse than it needs to be.", "I saw that.  He even brags that the landlord knows.  I bet the landlord knows that he has a fight on his hands.  Any landlord I know has evicted people and put all their stuff in the trash.  They know what to do about that.  If this is not a troll, then OP will squat, get evicted, and then his credit report will have a ding on it for that.  Then where will he live.  He is shooting himself in the foot.  (If this is real, anyway.)", "Think about this: How do you find a roommate when you don\u2019t know how long the space will be open?  How do you advertise that you are looking for a roommate for maybe a few weeks, maybe several months, however long it takes for GF\u2019s grandma to be okay living alone?  What do you think the chances are that the manager would even agree to this?"]}
