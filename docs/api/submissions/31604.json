She\u2019s a practicing exhibitionist, but only on unsuspecting victims?", "Maybe she should stop exposing other people to her kinks without their consent if she doesn\u2019t like it  when people do things without her knowledge.", "Definitely ESH. Hear me out.\n\nYes, OP was totally TA for discussing his girlfriend's kink with his coworker without her permission.\n\nOn the other hand, it is absolutely abhorrent and wrong to include anyone in your kink without their express knowledge and consent.  It sounds like part of her kink is the non-consent of these men who she likes to involve in her kink, given that the first time she has an INFORMED, WILLING and CONSENTING party to witness her kink, she loses her shit.  This is unethical kink behavior and makes her a total AH as well.\n\nESH all the way.", "This is a clear ESH and that fact your placing it all on OP shows the bias. She was doing the **exact** same thing OP did to her with everyone else. She just didn't like it when she was the one being surprised.", "Oh brother. I bet you also think her guy friends are just \u201cguy friends\u201d too, huh?", "Maybe his gf shouldnt pull unsuspecting victims into her kink games thats equally shitty", "He\u2019s better off with getting a new girlfriend.

OP is horrible, but his GF is a predator for involving people in her kink.", "ESH. GF doesn't understand consent either - she is involving unsuspecting guests in her kink.

She consents to being ogled under her terms.  If that\u2019s her thing that\u2019s her her thing.  \n\nHowever he went behind her back bragging to his coworker about it.  Then furthered it by wanting to take advantage of it.  Both for himself and somebody she is probably not too familiar with.  Then further lied about the reason for him to cover over.

Also learn the difference between legally allowed and socially acceptable. If it's not socially acceptable, it's probably because it's a dick move.\n\nHell I just decided my kink is standing outside the door and sniffing really loudly when women who visit my house go to use the toilet. That's totally acceptable because it's my house and I'll sniff where I want.\n\nAlso if I let you wash your clothes at my house I get to hold them and smell them while I masturbate because that's just a given, right.", "r/facepalm", "So if I call someone a slur while they're in my home, it's okay because they can just leave if they feel disrespected?", "You want them to gouge out their eyes?

If that\u2019s how she regularly dresses that\u2019s an entirely different story. She\u2019s personally described it as her kink and is involving other non-consenting people in said kink. I know the reflex is to stand up for the woman, *especially* when it comes to issues of policing their clothing, and I\u2019m not saying that sarcastically. It really is a big issue and is normally something that should be called out as sexist but this situation is not the same and I think you know that.", "Yeah I was just thinking how weird it would be if I came over to hang out with my friend and his girlfriend and she\u2019s wearing as little as possible", "I was thinking this might be a pre-negotiated arrangement she had with some of her male friends, but that\u2019s pretty optimistic considering she apparently never explained this to her actual boyfriend.", "What's ESH?", "The idea of \u2018suspecting\u2019 victims kinda undoes the whole point of exhibitionism no? \n\n\u201cOmg what if someone catches us?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry baby, they\u2019ve been briefed and signed this here waiver\u201d.  * begins pounding *", "What in his post points to that?

Yes she has issues, but I wouldn't call her TA in this scenario, for 2 reasons. 1, he hasn't stated that anyone told her to stop or why thats bad- she's not an AH for not knowing something, just ignorant of the topic.

It's something that she enjoys so I go along with it**\n\nHe found a pattern when she moved in, he later in his post says he told coworker about said Kink and her response is that she didn't want him coming over again.
