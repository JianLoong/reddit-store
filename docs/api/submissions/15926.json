I once heard that resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die, and that resonates with me.  So in my view forgiveness is given not for the benefit of the wrong-doer, but to free the wronged party from poisoning their own life by holding on to hurt and/or resentment.  Frankly, I don't even think the wrong-doer necessarily needs confirmation of that.\n\nNow forgetting, though.  That is entirely for the benefit of the wrong-doer.
