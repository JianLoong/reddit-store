{"id": 6098, "submission_id": "zzvbuq", "title": "AITA for letting my of-age nephew get drunk with us?", "selftext": "I feel this situation is ridiculous, but there's enough doubt that I need to ask this. \n\nMy family has always been pretty boozy. The adults in my family have always drunk at parties or celebrations. This may be a bad thing to some I guess, but they've always made sure that the drinking happens in a separate room where all the underage family isn't allowed, people are cut off if they go to far, and designated drivers are always chosen if the person is not spending the night. \n\nThe biggest issue, in my opinion, is my SIL \"Utah\" (not her name.) Utah is a Mormon from, well, Utah. She converted my brother and entered the family over 2 decades ago, and she has always been the biggest pain when it comes to this. Mormons don't drink, they think it's sinful. We've tried to accommodate her, specifically not drinking if she's hosting or the occasions around her family. But, when all 5 of your siblings and their families want to drink one person is not going to stop it. My family can put up with her, but I very much don't get along with her (I'm a lesbian and Utah is a pearl-clutching puritan.) \n\nOn Christmas, we got together as a family and per usual all the adults were drinking. Utah did not attend, but my brother and their kids did. As the night went on, their oldest son wandered into my parent's basement (the designated drinking room.) He eventually asked me if I would mix him a drink. He is 22, and was home with his parents for the holidays. My dad warned him that it was alcoholic and asked if his dad would be ok with it, he ignored the question and said he knew it was booze and wanted to try it out. His dad didn't know he came down and by the time he found out, his son was already obviously tipsy. My brother at the time didn't react badly, and was only surprised that he came down and wanted to drink with us, but said he was worried about how Utah will react. What I didn't know at the time was that Utah and her son got into a fight earlier that week and that this was partially a way to rebel against hist mother. \n\nWell, as the night was coming to an end and after my brother got home, Utah called my parents screaming at them for letting her son get drunk. She said they are attacking her families faith and calling them horrible. I hopped in and defended them, thanking her for not showing her face this Christmas. This is when I learned of the fight and congratulated her on deconverting her son better than I ever could of. She took this as me attacking her and her faith and we ended up screaming at each other till my dad hung up and told me to drop it altogether. Now, shit has hit the fan. My family says to just drop it and move on but I feel like we have nothing to feel bad about here.", "created_utc": 1672497109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzvbuq/aita_for_letting_my_ofage_nephew_get_drunk_with_us/", "score": 1961, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mom will redirect and start blaming you and all your family, OP, but it'll give a little breathing room to the son. At 22, that's post-mission age and when he's expected to be finding someone to marry; if he did go on a mission, that's its own bundle of trauma to sort through for most returned missionaries. \n\nI know why the mom went off the rails, though: rejecting your Mormon faith literally means you are walking away from the chance to be with your family forever. That's the \"true\" doctrine of the church, holding eternal families hostage to buy obedience. It's \"Families *Can* Be Together Forever\" and that \"can\" is the point on which it all hinges. It's not guaranteed, it's conditional. And to her, all of this means that she loses her baby boy for forever. So I can offer her some grace, just like I do my own family. But that doesn't excuse or pardon her behavior, nor does it give her a pass to continue it. This poor kid is going to have to keep sticking to his boundaries, and it's going to suck and be painful and his mom probably won't let up, if anything she's going to double down.
