{"id": 6098, "submission_id": "zzvbuq", "title": "AITA for letting my of-age nephew get drunk with us?", "selftext": "I feel this situation is ridiculous, but there's enough doubt that I need to ask this. \n\nMy family has always been pretty boozy. The adults in my family have always drunk at parties or celebrations. This may be a bad thing to some I guess, but they've always made sure that the drinking happens in a separate room where all the underage family isn't allowed, people are cut off if they go to far, and designated drivers are always chosen if the person is not spending the night. \n\nThe biggest issue, in my opinion, is my SIL \"Utah\" (not her name.) Utah is a Mormon from, well, Utah. She converted my brother and entered the family over 2 decades ago, and she has always been the biggest pain when it comes to this. Mormons don't drink, they think it's sinful. We've tried to accommodate her, specifically not drinking if she's hosting or the occasions around her family. But, when all 5 of your siblings and their families want to drink one person is not going to stop it. My family can put up with her, but I very much don't get along with her (I'm a lesbian and Utah is a pearl-clutching puritan.) \n\nOn Christmas, we got together as a family and per usual all the adults were drinking. Utah did not attend, but my brother and their kids did. As the night went on, their oldest son wandered into my parent's basement (the designated drinking room.) He eventually asked me if I would mix him a drink. He is 22, and was home with his parents for the holidays. My dad warned him that it was alcoholic and asked if his dad would be ok with it, he ignored the question and said he knew it was booze and wanted to try it out. His dad didn't know he came down and by the time he found out, his son was already obviously tipsy. My brother at the time didn't react badly, and was only surprised that he came down and wanted to drink with us, but said he was worried about how Utah will react. What I didn't know at the time was that Utah and her son got into a fight earlier that week and that this was partially a way to rebel against hist mother. \n\nWell, as the night was coming to an end and after my brother got home, Utah called my parents screaming at them for letting her son get drunk. She said they are attacking her families faith and calling them horrible. I hopped in and defended them, thanking her for not showing her face this Christmas. This is when I learned of the fight and congratulated her on deconverting her son better than I ever could of. She took this as me attacking her and her faith and we ended up screaming at each other till my dad hung up and told me to drop it altogether. Now, shit has hit the fan. My family says to just drop it and move on but I feel like we have nothing to feel bad about here.", "created_utc": 1672497109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzvbuq/aita_for_letting_my_ofage_nephew_get_drunk_with_us/", "score": 619, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mom will redirect and start blaming you and all your family, OP, but it'll give a little breathing room to the son. At 22, that's post-mission age and when he's expected to be finding someone to marry; if he did go on a mission, that's its own bundle of trauma to sort through for most returned missionaries. \n\nI know why the mom went off the rails, though: rejecting your Mormon faith literally means you are walking away from the chance to be with your family forever. That's the \"true\" doctrine of the church, holding eternal families hostage to buy obedience. It's \"Families *Can* Be Together Forever\" and that \"can\" is the point on which it all hinges. It's not guaranteed, it's conditional. And to her, all of this means that she loses her baby boy for forever. So I can offer her some grace, just like I do my own family. But that doesn't excuse or pardon her behavior, nor does it give her a pass to continue it. This poor kid is going to have to keep sticking to his boundaries, and it's going to suck and be painful and his mom probably won't let up, if anything she's going to double down.

It\u2019s gross when people try to force religion (or any beliefs) on anyone, kids included - coming from a former catholic school (kindergarten to high school) girl who\u2019s seen a lot of it. I mean, don\u2019t let the kid drink at 12, lol that\u2019s still illegal. \n\nTeach them about it, get them to understand what it\u2019s about (and ideally other religions so they can make an informed choice on what they believe) and be respectful of other people\u2019s beliefs. But let them make their own choices. \n\nThe age I was supposed to get confirmed at was 12 (if I\u2019m remembering correctly). The teacher made it clear it was our choice, not anyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s a step towards your own faith journey and no one else (including your parents) can make that decision for you.\n\nUnfortunately many parents didn\u2019t agree and forced their kids to anyway. It didn\u2019t make the kid more religious, but in many cases it seemed to effect the parent/child relationship in a negative way.", "Sorry... I see this as OP knew exactly what she was doing & got the response she expected. Goes back to my judgment of e s h. The dad & the 22 yr old should have accepted the responsibility of their behavior knowing damn well mom was going to lose her shit. SIL should\u2019ve never made that phone call but OP knew she was pushing SIL\u2019s buttons.", "Agreed. Mormonism is ridiculously strict, so stepping a foot out of line may be considered rebellion, but he\u2019s 22, he could just be trying to figure out what he likes.", "It could obviously be for any other reason, but something written in the post isn\u2019t \u201cwild speculation\u201d lol", "That\u2019s what OP said.", "Last sentence of OP's penultimate paragraph.", "Why is the mom free to be a controlling aggressive asshole and everyone is just supposed to accept it and her attacks?\n\nIt\u2019s not the dads (or anyone\u2019s) responsibility to enforce the moms rules on the 22 year old son. \n\nThe son has free will - which is something most religions encourage, or there supposed to according to their own writings at least.", "My very Mormon mother (prior to me going NC) always said I was rebelling if I did something different than her. Last time we had that conversation I was 36 and a married parent. Mormonism is very controlling and infantalising. It is maddening.", "Yes it is, the post makes it even more likely. She wildly speculates someone else\u2019s intentions in a way that infantilizes them. The post makes it clear that there is no evidence for the speculation. \n\nLol, why wouldn\u2019t he just be drinking because he wants a beer. He\u2019s 22.", "Ok, and?", "Lol yes, and? She wasn\u2019t the son, so it was just a conclusory statement with no evidence, AKA a speculation.", "Life is challenging enough. The last thing anyone needs is their family working against them. These women don\u2019t like each other. Let Dad get the kid drunk if that\u2019s his prerogative. Just stay out of it. Let their family do them. It\u2019s not challenging to say \u201chey I support your choices but I\u2019m not going to help you get in trouble. Talk to your Dad\u201d. They all understood the consequences... you can\u2019t throw your hands up & say well \u201cwe did nothing wrong\u201d. C\u2019mon man! You don\u2019t have to like the family\u2019s choice of religion but it\u2019s not that hard to be respectful of their choice. Just don\u2019t get involved. This is basically like saying our family is vegan & OP decides to give the kid a big piece of steak. Why?!? If you can\u2019t help, don\u2019t hurt.", "He\u2019s 22, not a kid. And even if he was, forcing religion (or any beliefs) on kids is messed up and can be abusive. \n\nInteresting choice of words you have there with the \u201cyou don\u2019t have to like the family\u2019s CHOICE of religion but it\u2019s not that hard to be respectful of their CHOICE.\u201d...\n\nI\u2019m not sure you understand the word choice or respect. \n\nYour saying they should have forced the 22 year olds MOMS CHOICE of religion on him (by doing so they remove his choice and it\u2019s now moms CONTROL, not his choice). \n\nAnd you seem to think respecting their religion means allowing the religious party to force their believes on others and get aggressive with anyone who doesn\u2019t do so. \n\n\u201cReligion is like a penis. It\u2019s a perfectly fine thing to have and take pride in, but when one takes it out and waves it in front of my face we have a problem.\u201d", "You are assuming that the 22 yr old doesn\u2019t agree with his religion & it was forced upon him. I see it as a kid who wants to piss his mom off because they had a fight. We have no idea what that fight was about. If he doesn\u2019t want to practice that religion, then don\u2019t. The point is everyone, including Dad & kid knew how mom would respond. So that\u2019s on them. OP took it a step further & included herself in this battle. So don\u2019t claim to be shocked when mom isn\u2019t happy.", "Also, she has been OP\u2019s SIL for over 2 decades... clearly she hasn\u2019t forced anything on anyone because they clearly are all free to do their own thing in their own lives. It\u2019s not the end of the world if people don\u2019t drink. I personally wouldn\u2019t stay very long at a family party if there was no drinking, however I would respect their choice to think it\u2019s sinful. Weird, but whatever!!", "I\u2019m assuming nothing. \n\nHe CHOOSE to get drunk. \n\nIt was HIS choice that he was free to make for whatever reason he wanted to. \n\nIt\u2019s not OK that his mom was trying to force HER CHOiCE of not drinking on him or anyone else.\n\nLol no one has to put up with someone being aggressive with them just because \u201cthat\u2019s how she is\u201d. It\u2019s SILs choice to start getting aggressive, so she can deal with the consequences. Which in this case was OP matching her aggressive energy.", "She clearly is trying to force her son to follow her religious rules, that\u2019s what the aggressive phone call was. Her getting angry the others didn\u2019t deny her kid that choice. \n\nNo one in this story seems to care if anyone else drinks or not except the crazy lady screaming at people and calling them horrible for letting the 22 choose to drink."]}
