OP never wanted to go to in the first place; on top of that, it\u2019s not a typical social setting for an 18 yr old woman. Finally, she used a credit card that she already had in her possession for groceries and other things. \n\nThat\u2019s nothing like a guy willingly going to a party and then not getting to leave exactly when he wants to. \n\nWith that being said:  if a girl talks a guy into going to a party and promises to leave by certain time; eventually, he has the right to leave on his own.  Let\u2019s say, for example, that he had to work in the morning and needed to get a reasonable amount of sleep. \n\nIf he happens to have her credit card, because she gave it to him to hold; I would have no problem with him using it.", "It's her dad and he isn't taking no for an answer.  She said no several times.  I have to wonder at the dynamic where her dad forces her to go with, it sounds like a control issue.

That\u2019s an apples to oranges comparison.", "She did not have the means to leave, except from her father driving her or his credit card.

What other realistic options did she have?", ">If he happens to have her credit card, because she gave it to him to hold; I would have no problem with him using it. \n\nThat's still theft and would never hold up in court. Holding someone's credit card is not consent to use it at their inconvenience.", "2 wrongs don't make a right. It's still theft.", "Ok, so a date stealing from the other is wrong, but it's ok when children steals from their parents?", "Use her own money, call a friend, call a family member...\n\nPlenty of other options than theft.", "I disagree. He needed to get home and she kept him past the time that was promised. It\u2019s not like he went out and bought a PS5. \n\nIt would absolutely hold up in court.", "He gave her a card for groceries and other expenses.  I think holding her hostage at a 50 plus male party counts as \"other expenses\" especially when she has begged to leave.  She is not a toy; she is a human with feelings and rights.  Her dad put her in a very uncomfortable situation when she tried to not go.  He turns into a first-class baby and pouts, ignores and basically makes her life miserable if she doesn't go.  He is in a position of power as her father that he abuses.  He lied to her and does it repeatedly.  Would you really say that she is obligated to be in that kind of position when she had been given, by her dad, the power to leave?", "If he forces her to go and denies to go back home several times - yes", "Why does she have to use her own money? She did not want to go in the first place, and then her father strung out the visit.  \n\nBased on the circumstances, they arrived around one. Dad promised to only have some coffee, which is about an hour max.  So they should\u2019ve left by two or maybe 230. She didn\u2019t use the credit card until 8 PM. \n\nAgain, how is it that? He gave her the credit card to use.   What friend is going to come pick her up when she\u2019s 50 minutes away?", "Describing it as her being held hostage is a gross exaggeration. No one stopped her from leaving, the fact that he didn't even know she left speaks volumes to that. She wasn't obligated to go, nor was she forced to stay. Also no she's not done toy, she's a young adult capable of making her own choices. She could gave chosen to not go out leave at any time,  that doesn't mean she gets to steal from him to do it.", "No one forced her to do anything, that's being over dramatic. Choosing to go because you don't feel like arguing doesn't then make theft acceptable. If she wants to leave, then she can use her own money.", "girl picks up guy for a party.

Rarely was there anything for me to eat or drink (bars where I grew up didn't serve food, only liquor). Each time my dad would bring it up I'd argue that I didn't want to go and that I was miserable but he always remembered at being SO MUCH FUN and would bully me into going.

He can always just call a cab for himself and save everyone the trouble.", "NTA.  You caved and went with him which is on you but that\u2019s small compared to his complete insensitivity while you were there.  It\u2019d be a long time before I went anywhere with him again.", "NTA show him this and how the world thinks of him", "NTA\n\nYou repeatedly told him to let you stay home, but he didn't.\n\nYou repeatedly told him to take you home, but he didn't.\n\nI hope you have the driver a nice tip on his dime.\n\nDragging you along to see HIS friends and then not even do anything to include you is not going to help you learn to socialize (if you even really needed to in the first place)\n\nNext time he can leave you alone and pay for his own cab home when he lets himself get drunk.", "He won't take no for an answer because YOU won't tell him no.  Still you are NTA.", "I think the silent treatment from him sounds great. You need to practice saying \u201cno\u201d and sticking to it. So far, you have trained him your \u201cno\u201d doesn\u2019t mean no and rewarded him for yelling at you and guilt tripping you. \n\nFrom now on, all he gets is \u201cno.\u201d Don\u2019t explain why it\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d because then he thinks he can debate you. Just \u201cno.\u201d \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d if you\u2019re feeling nice. \n\nNTA, obviously.", "YTA but for leaving without telling him and also for not sticking up for your self.  \"the phrase he wouldn't accept no for an answer\" Here is the thing about that - he would have choice but to accept if you said no and then did not cave in to him. He does this because it works.  He can't guilt trip you you allow him to make you feel guilty. If he yells walk away. If he refuses to speak to you then that seems like you will get he quiet you need to study. You are going to have to learn to be ok with people being upset. You do not have to participate in every argument you are invited to.", "NTA you shouldn't have to sacrifice you academics and sleep so you dad can have a good time.  This behavior is really weird and irresponsible coming from a parent. Most parents would be elated to have a child that prioritizes their education and sleep i sure would. You are not the ah and i hope things go well for you.", "NTA - he is basically lying to you over and over again as the time wears on.  He has no intention of leaving.  100% don't go any more. You are 18 years old and an adult.  The way I would say it is, you strand me by not leaving when you say you will and I have my own life now and I can't trust you to keep your word to leave when you say you will.  So I won't be going any longer because I can't trust you and I won't be held captive any longer.", "Wouldn't work. Dad would take the card or send the cab away once it arrived. Being sneaky was the only option", " Actions do have consequences even if the actions are justified.", "Ask him how he expects that, when all he does is take you around his old male friends?", "I understand what you are saying, but that's a completely different scenario than this one......\n\nIf someone kept you somewhere you didn't want to be, after they promised you didn't have to stay, and when you were trying to leave what would you call it?\n\nThe dad emotionally manipulates his daughter into coming with him to situations where she is an 18-year-old female surrounded by 50 something men.  Not cool by itself, and then there is the fact she keeps telling him she doesn't want to go, has homework etc., he promises to only be gone a short while then keeps her there for one more drink, or another meal, or some other bs reason.  \n\nShe has to get up for school at 5:30. Several hours past the promised return home time so she can get homework done and get ready for bed, she is still begging him to keep his promise and he gets mad she is asking.  This isn't a one-time thing.  He does this constantly.  She is understandably frustrated, and he is ignoring her, so she gets fed up and leaves.  \n\nThis is an hour and a half away so she has no way to walk it.  He won't take her home so she does the only thing she can do.  \n\nIf she was simply a spoiled brat and didn't want to stay at a gathering she went to and went home, that would be different.  She isn't.  She is a teenager who is emotionally manipulated by her father and gave up.  \n\nI understand if it were a scenario such as you described in your situation, maybe, but he kept her there against her will.  She begged to go home.  After first begging not to be made to go and being promised it would only be for a quick coffee.  To refuse to get her home after having promised to do so several hours earlier is detaining her against her will.  \n\nMy comment about being held hostage was in reference to the emotional manipulation and invisible bonds he created by his immature behavior.  She was indeed, a hostage."]}
