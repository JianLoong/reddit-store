I work full time and am not home often enough to do much but laundry, play games and sleep. I am fully aware that I have some occasionally annoying habits like playing music when I clean, leaving laundry in bathroom (in basket) and sometimes not doing chores when I\u2019m tired but I\u2019ve made it clear from the beginning that if I do something to annoy roommate to please tell me, it hurts me more if you say nothing about it. \n\nFew weeks ago my roommate said something uncomfortable about my good friend regarding their cultural practices, I told my friend the situation. This is where it went downhill, another friend who was in the loop told me roommate were on public discord servers talking about how much he hates me and telling others about my home-habits. This made me uncomfortable as I have asked him to be honest, additionally I feel disrespected how he talks about my private life behind closed doors to his large group of friends plus anyone else who sees, I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was venting to small group of friends but my friends were able to come across it and read it that\u2019s where it seems cruel. This was the last straw for me after what he had said about my friend and also a previous incident of his friend and himself calling me a transphobe and anti-Semitic over playing a game (take a guess) I was gifted by my sister (F17) for my birthday the week a mate of mine passed away. I had taken the week off to grieve and had distracted myself with game.\n\nWith all this in mind and the lease renewal upcoming I have decided to move out, giving him two months notice of my departure so he isn\u2019t thrown off so I can move to my bff\u2019s in another city and begin my studies. He\u2019s taken the initiative to begin hunting for someone to replace me and even had someone to look last weekend, though I was confused by beginning the search so early I didn\u2019t question as that\u2019s his choice. That was until he told me I needed to leave two weeks earlier than the lease renewal to allow him time to move his content into my bedroom and let the new tenant move in. I firmly put my foot down and said no as it\u2019s my legal right to remain on the lease until renewal, I mentioned I would seek legal consult if he insists because this would put me in awkward position as I can\u2019t leave the city until a certain date due to prior commitments.\n\nI began moving all my belongs into my room to begin packing but left the furniture in the lounge while I begin to organize myself. As soon as I did he moved the whole layout around which is fine as Im leaving but he also began setting up his tv system on my cabinet he didn\u2019t ask to keep. This annoyed me as he assumed but instead of talking to him I\u2019ve gone ahead and put the furniture I bought on marketplace.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1680001399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124l39w/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_im_moving_out/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s happened to me to a lesser extent, the room is yours until you\u2019re done paying for it the stuff you bought is yours unless he wants to give you money for it and discusses it with you.", "NTA. You had an all over bad roommate. Be glad you get a fresh start, so soon, and forget about him. And yes, do not allow him to take advantage of you by keeping free furniture or moving up your leaving date.", "NTA. I know we only have one side of the story, but your roommate sounds exhausting.", "Nta sounds like an unpleasant roommate. I'm glad you get to close the door on him soon.", "Nta, make sure you lock your room and hide valuables in your car.", "NTA. \n\nWe're only hearing your side of things, so to be charitable I'm going to assume that you and your roommate just had a personality clash. Not everybody gets along with everyone else, and the best thing to do is just move on. You've given plenty of notice to someone who appears to strongly dislike you, so frankly he should be thankful that you're going. The process of finding a replacement can be a pain, but life is pain and he needs to deal or move back in with his parents. \n\nSo legally two things: it is absolutely your right to remain until the end of the contract period. Don't let him pressure you. In fact, notify your landlord that he is trying to move you out earlier and let them know that you will pursue legal action if he tries. Second, see if you can't get friends to help you move, so that you will have back up once you remove your roommate's television to reclaim your cabinet. A lot of people just assume that furniture is communal or belongs \"to the house\" because all tenants use it, but be ready to put your foot down on that one. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA, you should move out!", "NTA about the roommate situation. You are an A H for buying that game and not pirating it. You are giving money to a terf and antisemitism", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
