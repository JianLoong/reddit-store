NTA majorly! also, germs!", "NTA. Of course your husband thinks it\u2019s no trouble because he won\u2019t be the one breastfeeding and taking the baby out when he\u2019s babbling and putting him to bed. It\u2019s unfair to pressure ruin into this, especially for a wedding of someone you are not close to", "NAH. Sounds like they really want you there but stand firm on your no. If it was a closer family member it would be worth considering but you\u2019re good.", "NAH but I think the biggest problem is that you originally checked if you could bring the baby. You should have declined for all the reasons you have stated. But by asking it makes it seem like you were willing to go then have taken the huff when originally told no, which makes it awkward for your husband.", "NAH I went with my 2nd child at 9 months old with her just over 2yo brother interstate, 1000 miles away on a plane, I fed her in between the ceremony and reception, then fed her again about 8pm put her to bed, stayed with her for an hour, then hubby came to the room for an hour whilst I went back to wedding to chat to hubby\u2019s sisters.   \nIf you don\u2019t want to go, that\u2019s fine, if it\u2019s only your baby there as the only child under 2yo, they\u2019ll probably get overstimulated though.", "NTA. \n\nWhat part of \"the effort\" is your husband making? Beyond attempting to guilt you, that is?", "NTA  Clearly, the bride has been pressured, just as you're being pressured.  She wasn't strong enough to stand her ground.  Do both yourself and the bride a favor by not giving in.", "NAH. It is a little weird that you would ask the bride if you can bring the baby when you weren\u2019t sure you were actually comfortable bringing the baby. She probably caught some heat from the family over this and it was all for nothing. Now the bride probably thinks you\u2019re not coming because you\u2019re annoyed about her initial response. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to go to the wedding. Just send a follow up text assuring the couple your decision wasn\u2019t personal.", "NTA\n\nThey don\u2019t want you there, the family just wants to see the baby. Trust your gut, you will regret agreeing to go.", "NAH.\n\nWe attended my BIL\u2019s wedding when our youngest was 20 months and took them with us.\n\nIn hindsight we wished we hadn\u2019t bothered as although I managed the ceremony and dinner I was basically out for everything else as the baby needed nap/fed/was grumpy from being overstimulated with so many people.", "NTA. \nBabies are tough, especially your first. You already asked and they said that they didn\u2019t want the baby there. \nSend your husband, if he would like to go as family is important and he would see a bunch. Don\u2019t feel pressure if going. In a year from now this will all be a non-issue all around.", "I mean, would you make more effort if it was one of your family? Whatever, if you don\u2019t want to go you don\u2019t want to go.

So I will definitely need to excuse myself from the majority of the ceremony.", "Yeh exactly! The venue is outside the city too so I'll have to leave early and get an uber by myself with a child seat to get home for his bed time at 7:30. Husband thinks we can just take him into a quiet room at the reception and take turns looking after him so he can sleep, but I just think that this won't work. Bed time is serious business for an 8mo.", "This. It won\u2019t be enjoyable for any of you.", "That's my concern - it is important to my husband, as it's HIS family. He's a very excited new dad and loves his son. He just wants some of the extended family to meet him. This is what is making me feel like the AH.", "[deleted]", "That trip sounds like hell with a baby. Stay home, I can't believe your husband isn't okay with that. He'll just have to get over it.", "NTA and I suspect the bride has been railroaded not changing her stance. Perhaps the family want the baby there as an opportunity to show them off to the wider family. Not very considerate of the very real practicalities at play!", "NTA because you don't have to go anywhere you don't want to go and your reasons are valid. You don't say what your baby is like. Are they fussy or contented? Are they happy to be passed around like a plushy toy or will they only settle for mam or dad? Most importantly, how do you think they will cope in a setting with loads of people they have never seen before?\n\nMy child was 8 months old when my sister got married. They slept through the whole ceremony, woke up for some grub and cuddles and then slept pretty much the whole night through and didn't care who was cuddling them as long as they were comfy. However, my sister's wedding was 20 mins from my house and I had all my family there happy to help if things went south. These are just a few differences that you have to take into consideration. \n\nGood luck and don't worry. Any decision you make will be in the best interests of your baby. And that is never wrong.", "Nah NTA:\n\n- Not worth the $$$ of travelling if you\u2019re not super close.\n- You\u2019ll be stuck with your baby, not your husband. So it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be having a \u2018normal\u2019 wedding/party experience, plus end up resentful as you\u2019ll know you should have stuck to your original decision. \n- They shouldn\u2019t have said it was a baby/kid free wedding and then changed their mind.", "NTA\nAny chance you could do a dry run where your husband is in charge? Pick a plane time and you have to \"make it\" to the airport on time.  Husband packs babya things,  gets everything organized in the morning,  breakfast food for baby,  plus more food for baby for the plane, he decides what time you have to leave (bonus points if it's right around nap time or feeding time),  brings all babys things,  (do you need to book the pushchair onto the flight?).  And literally any other thing you can think of. But just baby's things, because those are the least things you will need.  And then drive the airport and spend preflight time wondering around with grumpy baby. And ask him if it was as thrilling as he thought because all the work happens before baby even gets on the plane. When I don't want to go somewhere now and people keep bothering me,  I just say yes and then don't go and literally nobody has realised that's what I'm doing because they are only interested in pleasing themselves and they actually don't give a shit about you. And you can also be 100% certain the bride will be talking about you and your loud annoying baby ruining her wedding for the rest of her life.", "NTA. Generally a wedding is not an event for a kid that small", "NTA all of your reasons for not wanting to go are super valid", "NTA it'd be different if this wedding was taking place in a family friendly culture. But it's not. You were initially told no for a reason. Everyone is probably going to have more fun without the baby present. Including yourself. You'll have a better time staying home.", "NAH. They want you there, to the point that they are making allowances so you can, and that's sweet. You want to avoid the stress and stay home, which with an 8mo old is fair. No one is screaming about it, so no one is really an AH. \n\nFood for thought: exposing a baby to different environs and even somewhat flexible bed times and places can actually help you in the long run. It does pose a risk of infection, though... but he's about to hit constant infection months anyway. For us, that was months 8-12!\n\nWe have a 13mo old, and while we do have a routine, we follow her prompts: some nights, she gets to stay up a little later, others she goes to bed early. We don't keep a quiet environment, because her room is the center of our place. She has learned to sleep just fine. When they are tired enough, they will just drop off anywhere, which is a good skill for them to learn. \n\nWe have taken her to the in-laws quite a few times, which admittedly doesn't require a plane, but it's still hours of travel and a ferry. Sometimes, it goes smoothly, and others, not so much... but it's always worth it for the family and experience. My SIL even brought her 5 mo old to Canada from Australia and said he did great. That was like 20 hours of travel!\n\nThe point is, you don't know until you try. And if he doesn't take to it, then you say, \"Sorry, we tried, but he's not able to handle it today.\" At that point, you've put in the effort and probably have a 50/50 chance he'll be fine, and you can attend for part of it. I would hope that during the time you are there, there will be time to see some of the family outside of the wedding itself. It IS an effort and a hassle, but isn't every family event? Really, every event with a baby is going to be difficult, but with planning, it can be manageable.", "NTA. You\u2019re not preventing your husband from going. But why ask the bride if you can take your baby if you weren\u2019t actually thinking of going? If this was your side of the family would your response be the same? Only you know the answer to that.", "Just be honest and say you don\u2019t want to go. There are valid reasons so Quit making  excuses", "NTA. It's an invite not a summons.\n\"Sorry, but I checked with the baby, and he doesn't want to go. Of course he didn't use those words, but common sense + me being responsible to argue his needs on his behalf = we are not attending.\"", "I'm tempted to say NAH.  I completely agree that it would be easier for you not to go.  When you have a new baby they become the centre of your world and everything has to change to accommodate them.  But once they get past the newborn stage it's also important to start tentatively working out how that new person fits into your extended family life.  This weekend away might be stressful, or it might be OK, and either way it will be learning curve for you as a family and a step forward into blending your new lives as parents with your old lives as a couple.  I would suggest that you try to go, and even try his idea of seeing if your baby will fall asleep in their stroller, but on the agreement that your husband and his parents take turns to watch the baby so you can enjoy yourself too.", "NAH and if you don\u2019t want to go then of course don\u2019t but also try to understand his extended family seems excited to see the baby. Traveling with a breastfeeding baby on a plane is actually easier than when older because you just feed them to keep them quiet and they sleep. I was just at a family wedding with two babies and it was great. They were adorable during the ceremony and then shared a sitter in the hotel room\nStarting at bedtime so the parents came back downstairs to enjoy the wedding, they had a blast knowing their kid was safe asleep upstairs and could see them on the nanny cam.", "NAH - I have an 8 month old as well and I wouldn\u2019t want to put my little one through the trip you\u2019ve described. I agree with other commenters who have said that people just want to see the baby. Also, travelling like that with an 8 month old will mess up their sleep schedule and you\u2019ll be in a world of hurt when you get home. Your husband needs to back off and go by himself if he wants, but not force you to go too. Also, GERMS, because people are disgusting.", "Before ever reading the whole thing I thought NTA. Still think you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. you\u2019re free to decline any event you wish, but do you suffer from anxiety by chance? This post feels very much like it was written by someone with an anxiety disorder (no judgement I\u2019m the same way). Sometimes our anxiety really does get in the way of us enjoying our lives and I think this might be happening here. Travelling with a baby is no mean feat, but it\u2019s also not Armageddon. I moved country with a 3 month old so I know it\u2019s not ideal, but this could be a good family memory and a nice way to reconnect with your husband post baby and a good way for everyone to meet them. If you\u2019re anxious about attending you can also speak to other trusted family members and have them on standby if you need some extra hands while you\u2019re there?", "I actually think YTA here, very soft AH, mind you. Not because you don\u2019t want to take your baby, but because you spoke to the bride and she confirmed it was a baby-free wedding, she had then decided to change that rule solely for you, and now you\u2019re swaying with a different reason why you don\u2019t want to go.\n\nThis now totally looks like you don\u2019t like, and can\u2019t be bothered to make time for his family. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019d understand, they now probably feel awful that you don\u2019t want to attend considering your original reason had been sorted, you found another one.", "NTA x1000. I had the opposite at my childfree wedding almost 20yrs ago: people demanding to bring their babies and saying I was unreasonable to expect their partner to attend without them (to which I replied \"We will of course miss you on the day but completely understand why you are unable to attend \"). I wish more friends and family had been as reasonable and sensible as you!", "NAH - as a Mum with a 10 month old you are right in how you feel, Bride appears to be pressured however, she might not realise what impact it is to have a young one especially when breastfeeding. \n\nYou're not refusing, you've just declined the invitation for very valid reasons. It's not a summons to attend the wedding. \n\nOn the plus side - it's great to know your in-laws love you!", "NTA - hard agree with you OP - you wouldn't be able to have fun, its an unnecessary expense, a baby on a plane = usually hell for everyone on that plane, baby most of all. Baby at a wedding = usually hell for everyone there, especially the baby. The chance of COVID or other illnesses on a baby. \n\nHow much of the childcare would your husband be doing? Would be getting drunk? Would you have to deal with both a baby and a smashed husband? \n\nYou're not even close to the bride and groom", "NTA but I think you should go. I would want my wife to come with me to a cousins wedding. At the very least be flattered that they changed the rules because they specifically want you there.", "If his 8 mths now. He\u2019ll be older by then. Plus husband family will be there. I\u2019m sure they would all love to see you and your baby and hep through out the day. Grandparents do that. Support your husband and let him show off his beautiful family", "YTA. They literally changed their baby policy specifically for you to attend, and your husband wants to go. Attend, then leave the reception when it's your baby's bedtime.", "NAH. While they are kind to extend an invite including baby, if you don\u2019t feel comfortable, don\u2019t go. I will say that until about 8 months, babies are fairly easy to travel with, especially if breastfed. I took my 5-6 month old on a 14 hour flight no problem. When i took him on the same flight at 14 and 18 months, it was infinitely more difficult.\n\nI am actually at a wedding weekend right now with my now 23 month old and my husband and I will take turns being in room with baby after bedtime. Around 10pm I will call it a night and husband will stay a bit longer since it is his brother and family.", "NTA you don't even need a reason to say no, but you have a very good reason.   \nHubby needs to get over it. Stay with your little one and don't put the baby to the stress of a flight at 8 months.", "NTA - If you don't want to go then don't.\n\nBut - consider that the family may be excited to see you and the baby. You may find the baby taken from you by happy aunties who would love to hold and entertain him. You may find this is even a break for you. It may seem overwhelming now but this may be a good thing to get out for you. Also, your husband can and should also parent the baby. If baby is fussy and needs a changing - great hand the baby to dad to deal with while you go get a piece of cake.\n\nAgain, it is your choice.", "I really appreciate the bride trying to accommodate you. There will be lots of family near to help presumably. It\u2019s your choice but you may actually enjoy yourself and baby will be super popular.", "Not sure if you are tah but a baby doesn't prevent you from enjoying things. \nWhy don't you take a sitter? Your mom,/dad etc with you to have the baby or leave the baby with them for two days?\nWhat would you do if it were your sister or bff?\nA baby free evening isn't all that bad and I agree a baby or any children shouldn't be at a whole day event like that.", "Call your pediatrician and ask if it\u2019s safe for the baby to do that much traveling and be with a large group of people. Tell the doc you don\u2019t want to go. Many docs prefer no large crowds due to covid. Hubby can go by himself.", "NTA\n\nBride really doesn't care to have you and the cousin will notice for about 2 minutes and then go on. But you will be spending the whole time making all of the efforts to abide to the hubby's wants for the whole time; and he will be having a good time but putting in no effort for a showing of his family that no one will notice for more than a minute.", "Yes, YTA. Travelling with a baby may require some planning, but it does so until the stage of \"lazy teenager that stays at home.\" It is family, though not close, but since the bride has turned 180, she must want you there. Even though you do have much contact, they want to have you there, take it as a compliment, you're not the boring part of the family.\n\nSo pack all the baby stuff, and go to the wedding, and enjoy the good food and company.\n\nPS my sister lived 4000 km from the rest of the family. She took baby and toddler on business travels and back to family several times per year. Not a huge problem. Remember to feed the baby during take-off and landing to avoid ear problems with the pressure.", "How long would you be there? I'm asking because a great compromise would be to make the trip, spend a few days visiting but not attend the wedding. My dad's family lives out of state and I flew without my husband when my kids were 2 years and 6 months. Not easy but doable. This way everyone can meet the baby but you don't have to worry about the wedding itself.", "YTA. This is an opportunity for you to meet people as a family. You can always go to events and play the wedding by ear. I brought my son everywhere. I pumped so I could use a bottle. He was also on a strict bedtime, so I put him down in a spare room to sleep if I was at an event.\n\nIf you don't go, after they accommodated your request, it will make things very awkward for your husband.", "Bring the baby and stop being unreasonable. YTA", "NTA", "NTA You don't even need a reason. Taking and 8 month old anywhere is a lot of work.", "From the title - NTA\n\nFrom the story - NTA\n\nHow far do you have to travel? Like, another state away could be across a bridge in 15 minutes or hours away. \n\nTraveling with kids at that age sucks so bad. It\u2019s disruptive to their routine. They still have to sleep on their schedule, so you have to be able to have them nap and go to bed on time. \n\nYou have to make sure they have a safe place to sleep (pack n play or whatever). You have to bring diapers / wipes / clothes / so. much. stuff. \n\nThey can\u2019t eat solids yet entirely and are still on formula or BF, so you have to bring supplies for that and have safe solids to snack on. \n\nIt\u2019s just a lot. \n\nI get that everyone wants to meet baby.  But I would have a hard time committing to that. If you do decide to go, husband doesn\u2019t get to just go off and play. He gets to arrange all the packing you have to do and be present with you and baby and attend as a guest, not wedding party, ready to leave when you and baby are ready with no hard feelings or guilt tripping. \n\nOr, just stay home and FaceTime.", "NTA!!!!\n\nRSV......This is the absolute #1 reason not to go.    Taking baby on an airplane and then to a packed wedding and reception where everyone and their donkey will want to hold the baby and touch the baby and kiss the baby.  RSV is no fucking joke.  2 of my grandkids were in the hospital last November.   Big sis 3yo got it at preschool.  Gave it to her 6 week old baby brother.  Baby bro almost died.  He was hospitalized for 2 weeks one week in PICU.  DO NOT TAKE your son to this possibly deadly germ filled wedding.  Plus the bride originally said no.  It's your husband's family pushing for the baby to be there.  Her wedding is not the place for family to meet your son.", "NTA - totally up to you in terms of what you are comfortable with as a new mom.\n\nJust as a side note though, I took my twins to my SILs wedding when they were 6 months old (they are nearly 8 months now, same as yours). I was super uncomfortable, everyone wanted to hold the girls, they fussed throughout the ceremony so me and my husband had to duck out and stand to the side to comfort them, during the speeches I had to do the same. The music was too loud for them and it was generally quite over stimulating for them. I spent a good portion of the wedding breakfast in a quiet corner breastfeeding.

It was a straight up wrestling match - and I lost. And it wasn\u2019t for lack of planning. I had him in a baby sling. Quiet toys. Etc.

I did step away for feedings, but he was instantly in someone's arms the second he was dont eating.

People are so stuck in rigid routines for babies and children, and it stops them living your life. \nYou don\u2019t want your children growing up not being able to handle any change.

The younger you get them used to travel, sleeping in different places and going with the flow the easier it is to get them to adjust at each age and stage.\nI wasn\u2019t rigid as such with my first, but was much more flexible with my second and you can absolutely tell. \nBabies will change your life, of course, but they should not keep you chained to the house.

I was worried about that too, as it might seem like the no-baby rule was just a good excuse we ran with to avoid a difficult trip.

Doesn't make her an AH, but babies are difficult anywhere. Marginally easier at home, but family events are usually worthy of the effort.

Clearly you don\u2019t have kids. Weddings are meant to be enjoyable. Somehow a screaming infant makes it less enjoyable for everyone. Random noises during vows, breastfeeding during a reception, and a full fledged fit during dinner from overstimulation makes for a grumpy wedding and a stressed out mom from trying her best to keep an infant quiet (infants are, by nature, NOT QUIET). Furthermore, she will have to lug around a car seat all night (20 pounds-ish) to take the time to install it in a stranger\u2019s car. Not all Uber drivers will allow you to install a car seat in their car either. This is a night of stress rather than a happy joyous occasion for all who have the displeasure of hearing an infant cry, all for a relative that\u2019s not particularly close to them. Infants also don\u2019t tend to enjoy plane rides and new places so there will definitely be extra crying involved. Child free weddings are popular for a reason and the bride\u2019s initial response of \u2018no\u2019 tells me that she doesn\u2019t want screaming during her vows. I have a 3 year old. She wouldn\u2019t sit still for a wedding or stop talking, guaranteed. Kids don\u2019t naturally like to be still and silent for long periods of time and they don\u2019t have a concept of why this is so important.", "Oh, and I\u2019m a single mom, full time in college and working, and I \u201cmake it work\u201d in dire situations all the time.

I had to sit out in the car with him throughout the ceremony until he calmed down. Once we had dinner, we tried to get him to settle in a hotel room, but that didn't work, so we ended up leaving early. Went to my other BIL's wedding 6 weeks later and left both kids (my daughter was 3) with my parents so I didn't have to be stressed about them again.", "she asked to bring the child . got the yes . sooooo yeah .\nand per OPs comment , the extended family wants to meet the baby , a \"chill baby\" at that . \nshe's being unreasonable . and an AH . \ngiven all info provided , everything i've stated stands firm .", "[deleted]", "Hahaha a \u201cchill baby\u201d just basically means it cries half as much. They are all crazy. Based on your lack of acknowledgment, I was right in assuming you don\u2019t have kids. I take my child everywhere to make memories. It\u2019s embarrassing, difficult, and overall miserable when she has to sit still for any length of time. Other adults stare, obviously annoyed that they have to hear her. It\u2019s much better as a 3 year old than she was at 7 months, but she still wants to run and play and talk to every human near her. She will ask your name 43 times and if you don\u2019t answer she will get louder every time. My friend recently took her son to a wedding (also 3) and during the vows he loudly yelled to his other 3 year old friend trying to say hi. The. Entire. Time. I understand why someone might think it\u2019s a good idea but kids at a wedding is an awful idea. They are loud and unpredictable, and then when she goes to breastfeed someone will inevitably take offense even if she covers well, and the baby will get hungry during the duration of a wedding. I\u2019m just saying it is a miserable experience for everyone, and nobody wants that. Mom will be the least miserable, but most embarrassed by far.

Kids have no say in regards to raising babies.", "And how do you think is he supposed to figure the feeding part? The baby breastfeed.
