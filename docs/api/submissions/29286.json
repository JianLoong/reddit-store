I don't want to go, but people keep telling me I should just deal with it and figure out a way.  \nLet me give some background.\n\nThe groom is my husband's cousin. They're not that close - they only see each other once every year or so at large family events and never keep in touch in between. The wedding is in another state and we'd need to catch a plane there as it's too far to drive.  \nWe received an invitation, and we heard through the grapevine that we could bring our baby.  \n\n\nMy gut instinct told me - double check with the bride! I didn't want to commit the faux pas of bringing a baby to a wedding if it was not what the bride wanted. And sure enough, when we emailed her, she replied and said very clearly \"sorry, it's a baby-free wedding\". Of course that's fine, it's her choice! Her special day. So we replied and told them that husband would attend alone as I would have to stay at home with the baby. He's 8months old and still breastfeeding so I can't just leave him back home easily.  \n\n\nNot long after we sent the rsvp about me not coming, several people contacted us including the bride and groom trying to persuade us to go. Apparently now they'd changed their minds and the baby could now come to the wedding since they wanted me there too.\n\n  \nI told my husband I didn't want to go. Even though the bride had done a 180 on the no-baby rule, I still felt he was too young to attend and it would be too difficult to go interstate. I'd probably spend half if not most of the wedding absent, due to nursing, baby making noises and babbling during the ceremony and of course bed-time at 7:30pm.  \nIn my opinion, this is too much hassle for a short amount of family time! But my husband is upset and really wants us to make the effort and I'm starting to feel like I'm being unreasonable for putting my foot down and saying it was too hard.

Don't put a little baby and yourself through all that, especially as you are nursing. The bride told you how she really felt and then she got pressured to change her stance.", "NTA and no is a complete answer. I understand explaining it to your husband. But that's between the two of you. But if you don't want to go, there is no reason for anyone to pressure you.", "NTA\n\nYou do not want to go, and you have valid reasons why.\n\nJust tell your husband he can go alone, but you will not be attending. You are not being unreasonable.\n\nAnd in any case it will save on flights, and If he asks a relative could put him up for a couple of nights saving money on hotels as well.", "Plus 8 months is a hard age to travel with. They're restless and curious, they want to writhe around and crawl and touch things and explore, and they aren't old enough to entertain with anything for more than a few minutes.", "NTA. All of the reasons you listed for not attending are all valid points.\n\n>But my husband is upset and really wants us to make the effort. \n\nAsk him if he himself is willing to take care of the baby during all of the travel, during the ceremony, feed the baby throughout, hold the baby while at the reception and when talking to people, take the baby out himself when it cries, change the baby during the ceremony and reception if necessary, and then leave the reception at 7:30 pm to put baby to bed and stay with baby for the night. I have a feeling that if he would have to do all of these things himself, which you will likely end up having to if you go, then he wouldn't want to attend. If he says he would, call his bluff and enjoy a party weekend while your husband takes care of baby.", "YTA . they are accommodating you . it's just a baby ?!?! don't be THAT kind of mom .", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA majorly! also, germs!", "NTA. Of course your husband thinks it\u2019s no trouble because he won\u2019t be the one breastfeeding and taking the baby out when he\u2019s babbling and putting him to bed. It\u2019s unfair to pressure ruin into this, especially for a wedding of someone you are not close to", "NAH. Sounds like they really want you there but stand firm on your no. If it was a closer family member it would be worth considering but you\u2019re good.", "NAH but I think the biggest problem is that you originally checked if you could bring the baby. You should have declined for all the reasons you have stated. But by asking it makes it seem like you were willing to go then have taken the huff when originally told no, which makes it awkward for your husband.", "NAH I went with my 2nd child at 9 months old with her just over 2yo brother interstate, 1000 miles away on a plane, I fed her in between the ceremony and reception, then fed her again about 8pm put her to bed, stayed with her for an hour, then hubby came to the room for an hour whilst I went back to wedding to chat to hubby\u2019s sisters.   \nIf you don\u2019t want to go, that\u2019s fine, if it\u2019s only your baby there as the only child under 2yo, they\u2019ll probably get overstimulated though.", "NTA. \n\nWhat part of \"the effort\" is your husband making? Beyond attempting to guilt you, that is?", "NTA  Clearly, the bride has been pressured, just as you're being pressured.  She wasn't strong enough to stand her ground.  Do both yourself and the bride a favor by not giving in.", "NAH. It is a little weird that you would ask the bride if you can bring the baby when you weren\u2019t sure you were actually comfortable bringing the baby. She probably caught some heat from the family over this and it was all for nothing. Now the bride probably thinks you\u2019re not coming because you\u2019re annoyed about her initial response. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to go to the wedding. Just send a follow up text assuring the couple your decision wasn\u2019t personal.", "NTA\n\nThey don\u2019t want you there, the family just wants to see the baby. Trust your gut, you will regret agreeing to go.", "NAH.\n\nWe attended my BIL\u2019s wedding when our youngest was 20 months and took them with us.\n\nIn hindsight we wished we hadn\u2019t bothered as although I managed the ceremony and dinner I was basically out for everything else as the baby needed nap/fed/was grumpy from being overstimulated with so many people.", "NTA. \nBabies are tough, especially your first. You already asked and they said that they didn\u2019t want the baby there. \nSend your husband, if he would like to go as family is important and he would see a bunch. Don\u2019t feel pressure if going. In a year from now this will all be a non-issue all around.", "I mean, would you make more effort if it was one of your family? Whatever, if you don\u2019t want to go you don\u2019t want to go. You\u2019re right it will be hard work attending a wedding with a baby and if you can\u2019t be bothered then they will just have to accept it.", "NTA he can go alone.", "Even though he's a pretty chill baby, he's just learning to speak so I know he will babble a lot if the room goes quiet. So I will definitely need to excuse myself from the majority of the ceremony.", "Yeh exactly! The venue is outside the city too so I'll have to leave early and get an uber by myself with a child seat to get home for his bed time at 7:30. Husband thinks we can just take him into a quiet room at the reception and take turns looking after him so he can sleep, but I just think that this won't work. Bed time is serious business for an 8mo.", "This. It won\u2019t be enjoyable for any of you.", "That's my concern - it is important to my husband, as it's HIS family. He's a very excited new dad and loves his son. He just wants some of the extended family to meet him. This is what is making me feel like the AH.", "if you can't handle an 8mo old , just say that . some moms have to work to provide and are in more dire situations and somehow they all make it work , ohhh but a wedding oh no that's too hard ."]}
