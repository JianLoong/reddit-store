{"id": 33304, "submission_id": "18lfkg9", "title": "AITA for refusing to drive my daughter to surgery?", "selftext": "I (59 F) found out with four days warning that my daughter Dee (39F) is having minor surgery to have a cyst removed from her wrist. I at first offered to drive her and asked for the address. The facility was over 30 miles away and I would have to drive through two downtowns during rush hour. I asked why it was so far and Dee replied \"It was the soonest appointment\". I asked her to please call and see about getting it moved to one of the two closer locations (less than half the distance) as that kind of drive is very anxiety inducing for me. She refused even after I reminded her I get nervous driving in traffic since I was in a bad car accident a few years ago (black ice and concrete wall). \n\nI asked Dee to please wait until after the holidays when I would have more time. I explained to Dee that I just had two bilateral spinal ablations for severe arthritis and driving that far during rush hour would be hard for me. I also have a surgical boot and get tired easily with all the limping.  Again, she refused. Instead she told me since I offered I am now obligated to drive her. I calmly told her I can't do that and with other options available she was being rude demanding I drive her so far. She responding by calling me names and saying I was making stupid excuses. Dee also got her sister Ada (33F) to message me guilt trips. This went on for several hours and ended with me crying and turning off my phone. Since then Dee has scheduled an uber to take her and her younger sister Jay (34F) will pick her up. I thought it was all worked out until I woke up this morning. \n\nThere was a long Facebook post throwing me under the bus. I was accused of being mean, uncaring and unwilling to help. Dee told the world I care more for her sister's because I flew to another state when they needed surgery. I didn't respond to her post. Instead I contacted her directly and reminded her that I flew to another state to take care of my grandchildren while her sisters had major surgery (one was an emergency 13 years ago and the other scheduled when it was convenient for me 2 years ago). Dee has no children. \n\nThe more I tried to reason with Dee the more. stubborn she became. Now Dee is telling everyone she plans to ignore me on xmas day. When I said I won't be disrespected like that in my own home she said \"fine, I'll stay home then\". Dee is saying because she is ASD I should do what she wants. Dee lives in her own apartment and has a job so being on the spectrum isn't affecting her ability to take care of herself. She is being stubborn and unwilling to compromise. I want to help but she is demanding I do things beyond my ability. \n\nEdit: A lot of people are saying I shouldn\u2019t have offered in the first place. Dee\u2019s doctor is 7 minutes from my house. There are 5 hospitals within 10 minutes. I live in a metropolitan area so it never occurred to me Dee would choose facility so far away. \n\nAlso, I offered to take her if she chose a closer facility. She refused to even call and ask what was available.

Medical appointments are hard to get, it's unreasonable to assume someone can bend it to all your desired accomodations. You should have said no, or offered to ride an uber together.

She is however for demanding you can drive, while she should have known your offer was shit. And the ridiculous harassment campaign.", "Esh why did you offer in the first place????

She should however, take the no and move on.", "INFO: \n\nhow long after you agreed to drive her did you find out where the appointment was? based on the plan she landed on, there were other people she could\u2019ve asked initially. i\u2019m guessing you backed out on short notice, dee tried to whip up a backup plan, and couldn\u2019t within the day or two she had. \n\nalso: how urgent was the surgery? and/or how long was the wait at a closer location? i\u2019m guessing dee would\u2019ve rather a shorter drive too. but she had to move faster than the earliest appt at those locations. \n\nlastly: if you have trauma related to driving and an injury that makes it difficult to drive, why would you agree to drive her without details? when you realized the situation why not offer to buy her uber or work with her in some other way? \n\nunless your answers to this are surprising, you did completely screw her and i\u2019m glad she\u2019s setting boundaries for the holidays. also that line at the end about her not having kids says a lot.", "Info: why did you offer to drive her before you knew where the appointment is?", "ESH. No shit she isn't compromising on her own health care needs. I wouldn't either, and it's absurd that you think she ought to. BUT she also sucks since you said you can't do it and she's not taking no for an answer. Y'all are both clearly awful at communication and conflict resolution.", "ESH. You're both acting like children.\n\nYou - don't offer to drive if there are 75 conditions to the offer. \n\nShe - is almost 40 years old. She can figure out transportation if she can't suck it up and work around you.\n\nThis relationship sounds pretty toxic, honestly.", "My dad will offer something like this only after getting the details. Like he drove me to and back from cataract surgery also when I got large cyst drained from under my arm. Yet both were either close to me or him. We live about 20 miles away so it\u2019s a bit of a drive. But he helps if he can. Of course I\u2019ve done the same with his foot knee and hip replacement and stayed over till step mom could get home. It\u2019s family but if driving is painful you should not have offered.", "NTA. Y'all are acting like OP signed a contract to perform a service, rather than making a kind offer and then realizing it wouldn't work out after immediately asking for the relevant info and suggesting workable alternatives.\n\nIt could be NAH if Dee had dropped it after OP realized they couldn't fulfill the \\*favor\\* they offered. Instead, Dee rejected the help OP was able to offer, found other options, and then publicly shamed OP.", "NTA- maybe mild E S H because you offered without knowing the details. However, I think many people would assume that the appointment was at a closer hospital, and it\u2019s definitely an asshole move to assume you\u2019re guaranteed a free ride to a far away hospital from your mother WHO IS STILL RECOVERING FROM SURGERY and has trauma from a car accident. Four days is also extremely short notice for a commute of this length, especially since she made the appointment as soon as she could possibly get it. This is also not a medical emergency, a cyst on your wrist is not a \u201cdrop everything for me right now mom\u201d situation. Her poor planning is really not your fault, what is your fault is overpromising (though an offer is not a promise, you are allowed to rescind offers upon learning more information).

Where I live, that could take 45 minutes to 1.5 hours one way. \n\nIf your daughter really needs a ride from you, she should work with you to get a more convenient appointment and definitely NOT flame you on FB!

NTA", "ESH\n\nWhile I empathize with your own issues here, I think that knowing you have anxiety around driving it is on you to get the details before blindly making an offer to drive. A cyst in the wrist is likely painful and affecting her everyday life. And it absolutely is a threat to her health. You trying to make her move it to accommodate you and your life, when if it ruptures it could absolutely kill her, is as selfish as she's being. You then continuing to find reasons why you couldn't do that drive does have the feel like looking for excuses, even if they are valid. Again, should have played into you getting details first THEN deciding whether or not to offer. Because if you did, then you had the option to say \"I don't think I can make that drive, but I'm happy to help you figure something out.\" There's so many other reasons that those closer locations might not have worked too. Maybe they don't have someone on staff to do that. Maybe they're out of network. And of course as it sounds, they didn't have soon availability. And in your shortened version of the reason you think you're the asshole, you said\n\n>I feel like AITA for refusing to drive Dee to surgery even though I am physically unable to do so at this time.\n\nbut that's not what happened. What actually happened was that you offered to do it, and then rescinded that offer. You made the offer with all the factors in play, and then changed it.\n\nI do think Dee should realize that she's not entitled to that ride. She should be understanding of the circumstances of your health, and understand that while her health was an urgent need, that means getting creative on options. A solution was found, that works, and that SHOULD have been the end of it.", "NTA. Your daughter is being ridiculous.", "NTA but your daughter is. She is unwilling to compromise and is now treating and talking to you badly and trying to shame you for something that she isn't entitled to. You gave her plenty of ways to compromise so that you could still take her but she refused them all and is now saying you love everyone else more then her. Tell her to grow up and that the world does not revolve around her. Also don't feel guilty for not helping someone thats trying to make it harder for you.", "It\u2019s YTA for me bc you should have never offered to drive her with all your limitations.

Wow", "If it's just a cyst removal on her wrist, it's probably with just local anesthesia. really, why couldn't she just drive herself?", "NTA. A cyst isn't an emergency. She would have known about the surgery date at least 2 weeks+. Someone bailed on her and it sounds like she knows you aren't in a position to drive far", "ESH if you\u2019ve got that many issues with driving, why did you volunteer in the first place before knowing all the details?", "Dee can call an Uber", "NTA.  Dee seems very unreasonable about your legitimate reasons for why you can\u2019t drive her, as well as trying to look at other options. You might want to think about going LC or NC with her.", "ESH, but you're clearly worse.", "NTA. While you may have agreed initially, you have your own health needs to address. Something many of the other selfish people in the world seem to blindly overlook. You've tried to offer reasoning and compromise, and she is doubling and tripling down on her behavior. I'd say you've done as much as possible, given the available info. Dee needs to get her ish straight and stop crutching on her ASD. A cyst on the wrist is annoying but generally not life threatening. Def minor compared to anything touching someone's spine.", "YTA. I totally get that driving her would have sucked and maybe not been the best idea for you mentally or physically but then YOU should not have issued a  blanket offered to drive her. YOU chose to offer before knowing the when and where, then come up with excuses because it wasn\u2019t convenient to you. Your daughter has autism, she probably doesn\u2019t understand social cues or handle change well. Next time don\u2019t offer before you know the specifics, if you had waited, this all could have been avoided.\n\nEdit: since people seem to think I\u2019m okay with the daughter throwing a tantrum I\u2019m not, but the question was AITA for refusing to drive my daughter, not is my daughter TA because she can\u2019t control her emotions.", "NTA.

I asked her because my mother is like you. When I got admitted to the hospital, she complained about me asking her to pick up a few things (medications, phone charger, clothes) at my house before she came (I asked her not to come but she insisted so she might as well be helpful).

This time she'll have to get a Lyft.", "OP proposed several reasonable alternatives for this non-urgent surgery, which would have allowed them to do this \\*favor\\* for Dee. Dee didn't have to choose one of those options, but she shouln't have acted like OP was unwilling to help.", "When I had brain surgery a year a go, they had to schedule with my neurosurgeon *and* my ENT and work around both their crazy schedules, plus all the other necessary people. Even when I had a much easier nerve surgery on my hand, my surgery appointment was booked for like 4 months out. Even though it was not as complex as neurosurgery, they had to work with the Dr's clinic hours, plus schedules, patient priority, etc. like you mentioned. ***So*** many moving parts.", "Of course it is. At least 79 people didn\u2019t get it.", "Ye olde Bible cyst treatment!", "Not the case at all with benign cysts.", "The \"assume\" here is why it's an ESH from me. I get it, it's not easy for mum to make a long drive. That's why she immediately should have clarified where it was before making any promises. Promising and then going back in it will obviously make it difficult for Dee. But, daughter is way out of line too harassing her mum and going nuts while bringing others into it as well.", "Could be a ganglion cyst, very common on wrists. They used to smash them with books to burst them. No longer advised but no one dies.", "It could also be a case of already meeting her annual insurance deductible and not wanting to pay out more after the first of the year. Totally reaching here, I know.", "You can drive after a simple cyst removal. I've had them done before, and my daughter had one removed from her head, and she drove herself home.\n\nDee can most certainly drive herself to and from the appt.", "Arguing both sides at once is a talent that few possess. Good luck with that.", "It's the pretty clear implication of the first few sentences of the story.  \n\nDee didn't have a ride to a surgery four days away and asked her mom. If she had other plans or options for getting there she wouldn't have tried to demand her mom still drive her.", "The reason I say surgery is a big deal no matter what is because anytime you're put under anesthesia the number of complications goes up astronomically. I say this as someone who has had complications with anesthesia both times that I have had any type of surgery. And like you said some things are more complicated than others the first time was for my tonsils being taken out the second time was just for an ACL repair but my negative reaction to the anesthesia, depressed my breathing. The first time I could have literally have died because I got sent home too early and didn't have enough oxygen the second time we were prepared for it because of the first time.", "She didn\u2019t have all of the information up front. What if she had offered to drive her, asked her for the destination and it turned out to be over 3 hours away?", "Seriously. My husband had the surgery. He lost functionality.  Daughter needs surgery and won\u2019t do it.", "even benign cysts can be painful.", "Well, since neither of us are Ops kid or Ops kids doctor and the doctor *did* in fact schedule her for surgery, I'm gonna wing it and say this one does need to be removed.", "But it certainly seems like it was immediately (or close enough). One sentence is she offered and asked for the address. The next is why that is a problem for her. Then, it appears, the continuation of their conversation asking why it so far away. Most of the conflict (other than the social media post) takes place in one day. The daughter hadn't been relying on her offer for any period of time.", "Excellent point, waiting til after the holidays could increase the cost for the procedure significantly.", "I just very recently learned about this since I'm not American and this isn't an issue here. I had no idea before just a few weeks ago that getting sick/injured in december is literally the worst time if you don't have a lot of money. So you definitely could be right. Wish you weren't because I wish the system was different, but it is what it is.", "It could also be a case of use-it-or-lose-it leave from work.", "I mean, if you can't wrap your head around the fact that two people can both be wrong I don't know what to tell you. It's pretty simple shit.", "In no way is it implied.  \"I offered\" means OP...you know, OFFERED.  And I know \\*plenty\\* of people who offer favors and then make shit the other person's problem.  That plus the OP being a verrrrrry unreliable narrator, and seems to actively hate her daughter...yeah, no.", "That\u2019s my point\u2026 DON\u2019T OFFER UNTIL YOU HAVE ALL THE INFO and then this mess wouldn\u2019t have happened because she wouldn\u2019t have to back out of her offer", "Part of it depends on where it is on the wrist. My family has a history of ganglion cysts and they typically haven't required medical intervention, but sometimes they can grow in inconvenient or painful places. It could be that Dee is in pain or it could be that she just wants it gone, but regardless ultimately it would be up to her and her doctor to decide how soon the surgery should be.", "I\u2019m getting an MRI in a week. Because I\u2019ve spent $3500 on my healthcare this year (AFTER paying for health insurance and not counting prescriptions, vision, or dental), the MRI will be free. If I have it January 2, I\u2019ll have to pay IIRC $150.\n\nAnd this MRI? I booked it back in October, for a health problem I\u2019ve had since July.", "and saying she offered is perfectly consistent with being asked (either directly or indirectly) for a ride. So anyway, I disagree.\n\nBut, here's the thing, it doesn't matter at all to whether OP is the AH. Even in your situation, where a daughter who didn't have a ride to a surgery four days away first mentioned it to her mom (for reasons other than a ride), and the mom offers to drive her and asked for the address. This immediately caused the mom to tell the daughter that she wasn't able to make that drive (because it's was like an 1-1.5 hr's (plus all the mental issues) and ask for accommodations so she could drive her. That's isn't making it anyone else's problem. If the daughter doesn't want to move the surgery she is just in the same situation she was in 5 minutes before mom offered. She wasn't relying on this and got blindsided last minute, all she has to do is whatever she was planning to do before mom offered.", "Why didn\u2019t her daughter just give her the information up front?? Both of them suck, but the daughter completely over reacted", "Yeah, our health care system isn't perfect, but at least we don't have to go into debt to pay for it. Here, you pay a maximum of I think it's like $250 or something in a year. And that's for all kinds of visits, including mental and physical health. For meds you never pay more than around there ish either in a year. Sure, some meds aren't included in that but it's raaaaaaare. \n\nDental here is expensive though, which is why I haven't gone to the dentist in ages.", "The daughter didn\u2019t have the info when mom offered... She told her mom she needed surgery in the future, the mom said she would drive, then when the daughter found out when/where it was mom backtracked\u2026", "My healthcare \u2018year\u2019 starts in October and ANY time I have medical procedures you can bet I take that into consideration.\n\nDental is even worse though, to the point I\u2019ve had insurance agents tell me to pay out of pocket  because dental insurance is so bullshit - basically high premiums and low yearly caps, so not worth it.", "Yes, she did. OP found out four days ago. She agreed to drive her and then asked for the address. Her daughter gave her the information at that time, so she already knew where she needed to be before asking mom for the ride."]}
