{"id": 33304, "submission_id": "18lfkg9", "title": "AITA for refusing to drive my daughter to surgery?", "selftext": "I (59 F) found out with four days warning that my daughter Dee (39F) is having minor surgery to have a cyst removed from her wrist. I at first offered to drive her and asked for the address. The facility was over 30 miles away and I would have to drive through two downtowns during rush hour. I asked why it was so far and Dee replied \"It was the soonest appointment\". I asked her to please call and see about getting it moved to one of the two closer locations (less than half the distance) as that kind of drive is very anxiety inducing for me. She refused even after I reminded her I get nervous driving in traffic since I was in a bad car accident a few years ago (black ice and concrete wall). \n\nI asked Dee to please wait until after the holidays when I would have more time. I explained to Dee that I just had two bilateral spinal ablations for severe arthritis and driving that far during rush hour would be hard for me. I also have a surgical boot and get tired easily with all the limping.  Again, she refused. Instead she told me since I offered I am now obligated to drive her. I calmly told her I can't do that and with other options available she was being rude demanding I drive her so far. She responding by calling me names and saying I was making stupid excuses. Dee also got her sister Ada (33F) to message me guilt trips. This went on for several hours and ended with me crying and turning off my phone. Since then Dee has scheduled an uber to take her and her younger sister Jay (34F) will pick her up. I thought it was all worked out until I woke up this morning. \n\nThere was a long Facebook post throwing me under the bus. I was accused of being mean, uncaring and unwilling to help. Dee told the world I care more for her sister's because I flew to another state when they needed surgery. I didn't respond to her post. Instead I contacted her directly and reminded her that I flew to another state to take care of my grandchildren while her sisters had major surgery (one was an emergency 13 years ago and the other scheduled when it was convenient for me 2 years ago). Dee has no children. \n\nThe more I tried to reason with Dee the more. stubborn she became. Now Dee is telling everyone she plans to ignore me on xmas day. When I said I won't be disrespected like that in my own home she said \"fine, I'll stay home then\". Dee is saying because she is ASD I should do what she wants. Dee lives in her own apartment and has a job so being on the spectrum isn't affecting her ability to take care of herself. She is being stubborn and unwilling to compromise. I want to help but she is demanding I do things beyond my ability. \n\nEdit: A lot of people are saying I shouldn\u2019t have offered in the first place. Dee\u2019s doctor is 7 minutes from my house. There are 5 hospitals within 10 minutes. I live in a metropolitan area so it never occurred to me Dee would choose facility so far away. \n\nAlso, I offered to take her if she chose a closer facility. She refused to even call and ask what was available. \n\nEdit 2: Dee has a ganglion cyst on the back of her wrist. She told me it was a \u201clittle uncomfortable\u201d but when I asked her to change locations suddenly it was super painful.

Medical appointments are hard to get, it's unreasonable to assume someone can bend it to all your desired accomodations. You should have said no, or offered to ride an uber together. Especially with someone with ASD, don't make empty promises.\n\nDee is not an ah for wanting the first appointment. She is however for demanding you can drive, while she should have known your offer was shit. And the ridiculous harassment campaign.", "Esh why did you offer in the first place????  When you can't drive 30 ~~minutes~~ miles without anxiety.  Do you live in a small state/country?  \n\nHowever, she isn't an ahole either for not wanting to wait for surgery.  She should however, take the no and move on.", "INFO: \n\nhow long after you agreed to drive her did you find out where the appointment was? based on the plan she landed on, there were other people she could\u2019ve asked initially. i\u2019m guessing you backed out on short notice, dee tried to whip up a backup plan, and couldn\u2019t within the day or two she had. \n\nalso: how urgent was the surgery? and/or how long was the wait at a closer location? i\u2019m guessing dee would\u2019ve rather a shorter drive too. but she had to move faster than the earliest appt at those locations. \n\nlastly: if you have trauma related to driving and an injury that makes it difficult to drive, why would you agree to drive her without details? when you realized the situation why not offer to buy her uber or work with her in some other way? \n\nunless your answers to this are surprising, you did completely screw her and i\u2019m glad she\u2019s setting boundaries for the holidays. also that line at the end about her not having kids says a lot.", "Info: why did you offer to drive her before you knew where the appointment is?", "ESH. No shit she isn't compromising on her own health care needs. I wouldn't either, and it's absurd that you think she ought to. BUT she also sucks since you said you can't do it and she's not taking no for an answer. Y'all are both clearly awful at communication and conflict resolution.", "ESH. You're both acting like children.\n\nYou - don't offer to drive if there are 75 conditions to the offer. \n\nShe - is almost 40 years old. She can figure out transportation if she can't suck it up and work around you.\n\nThis relationship sounds pretty toxic, honestly.", "My dad will offer something like this only after getting the details. Like he drove me to and back from cataract surgery also when I got large cyst drained from under my arm. Yet both were either close to me or him. We live about 20 miles away so it\u2019s a bit of a drive. But he helps if he can. Of course I\u2019ve done the same with his foot knee and hip replacement and stayed over till step mom could get home. It\u2019s family but if driving is painful you should not have offered.", "NTA. Y'all are acting like OP signed a contract to perform a service, rather than making a kind offer and then realizing it wouldn't work out after immediately asking for the relevant info and suggesting workable alternatives.\n\nIt could be NAH if Dee had dropped it after OP realized they couldn't fulfill the \\*favor\\* they offered. Instead, Dee rejected the help OP was able to offer, found other options, and then publicly shamed OP.", "NTA- maybe mild E S H because you offered without knowing the details. However, I think many people would assume that the appointment was at a closer hospital, and it\u2019s definitely an asshole move to assume you\u2019re guaranteed a free ride to a far away hospital from your mother WHO IS STILL RECOVERING FROM SURGERY and has trauma from a car accident. Four days is also extremely short notice for a commute of this length, especially since she made the appointment as soon as she could possibly get it. This is also not a medical emergency, a cyst on your wrist is not a \u201cdrop everything for me right now mom\u201d situation. Her poor planning is really not your fault, what is your fault is overpromising (though an offer is not a promise, you are allowed to rescind offers upon learning more information). Also, making a Facebook post about this? She comes across as an entitled brat.", "You \"found out with four days notice\"? Was there a reason that Dee didn't tell you about her operation? YTA.

After learning it wouldn\u2019t work, I do think you should have just backed without trying to get her to change her options, however, considering she badgered you about it saying you can\u2019t back out from offering then I honestly don\u2019t blame you.

Where I live, that could take 45 minutes to 1.5 hours one way. \n\nIf your daughter really needs a ride from you, she should work with you to get a more convenient appointment and definitely NOT flame you on FB!  Especially in light of your recent surgery and past trauma! (I detest black ice. Snow, no problem)\n\nThrowing in her ASD is the revolting cherry on top. Clinched it for me. NTA", "ESH\n\nWhile I empathize with your own issues here, I think that knowing you have anxiety around driving it is on you to get the details before blindly making an offer to drive. A cyst in the wrist is likely painful and affecting her everyday life. And it absolutely is a threat to her health. You trying to make her move it to accommodate you and your life, when if it ruptures it could absolutely kill her, is as selfish as she's being. You then continuing to find reasons why you couldn't do that drive does have the feel like looking for excuses, even if they are valid. Again, should have played into you getting details first THEN deciding whether or not to offer. Because if you did, then you had the option to say \"I don't think I can make that drive, but I'm happy to help you figure something out.\" There's so many other reasons that those closer locations might not have worked too. Maybe they don't have someone on staff to do that. Maybe they're out of network. And of course as it sounds, they didn't have soon availability. And in your shortened version of the reason you think you're the asshole, you said\n\n>I feel like AITA for refusing to drive Dee to surgery even though I am physically unable to do so at this time.\n\nbut that's not what happened. What actually happened was that you offered to do it, and then rescinded that offer. You made the offer with all the factors in play, and then changed it.\n\nI do think Dee should realize that she's not entitled to that ride. She should be understanding of the circumstances of your health, and understand that while her health was an urgent need, that means getting creative on options. A solution was found, that works, and that SHOULD have been the end of it.", "NTA. Your daughter is being ridiculous.", "NTA but your daughter is. She is unwilling to compromise and is now treating and talking to you badly and trying to shame you for something that she isn't entitled to. You gave her plenty of ways to compromise so that you could still take her but she refused them all and is now saying you love everyone else more then her. Tell her to grow up and that the world does not revolve around her. Also don't feel guilty for not helping someone thats trying to make it harder for you.", "It\u2019s YTA for me bc you should have never offered to drive her with all your limitations. Even without your other issues it\u2019s still not normal to just volunteer with no info.", "A lot of excuses here.", "NTA. No notice and a big ask for a nothingburger procedure. Wow", "If it's just a cyst removal on her wrist, it's probably with just local anesthesia. really, why couldn't she just drive herself?", "NTA. A cyst isn't an emergency. She would have known about the surgery date at least 2 weeks+. Someone bailed on her and it sounds like she knows you aren't in a position to drive far", "ESH if you\u2019ve got that many issues with driving, why did you volunteer in the first place before knowing all the details?", "Dee can call an Uber", "NTA.  Dee seems very unreasonable about your legitimate reasons for why you can\u2019t drive her, as well as trying to look at other options. You might want to think about going LC or NC with her.", "ESH, but you're clearly worse.", "NTA. While you may have agreed initially, you have your own health needs to address. Something many of the other selfish people in the world seem to blindly overlook. You've tried to offer reasoning and compromise, and she is doubling and tripling down on her behavior. I'd say you've done as much as possible, given the available info. Dee needs to get her ish straight and stop crutching on her ASD. A cyst on the wrist is annoying but generally not life threatening. Def minor compared to anything touching someone's spine.", "YTA. I totally get that driving her would have sucked and maybe not been the best idea for you mentally or physically but then YOU should not have issued a  blanket offered to drive her. YOU chose to offer before knowing the when and where, then come up with excuses because it wasn\u2019t convenient to you. Your daughter has autism, she probably doesn\u2019t understand social cues or handle change well. Next time don\u2019t offer before you know the specifics, if you had waited, this all could have been avoided.\n\nEdit: since people seem to think I\u2019m okay with the daughter throwing a tantrum I\u2019m not, but the question was AITA for refusing to drive my daughter, not is my daughter TA because she can\u2019t control her emotions.", "NTA.  Your daughter is though, and she needn't be accommodated.  No one has to do what she wants as that will just make her more entitled and difficult.", "ESH", "ESH if you couldn't after you already agreed to you should've offered to pay at least half of the uber.

I asked her because my mother is like you. When I got admitted to the hospital, she complained about me asking her to pick up a few things (medications, phone charger, clothes) at my house before she came (I asked her not to come but she insisted so she might as well be helpful).

Why can\u2019t your daughter drive herself to get a pimple removed from her wrist?", "Ntah she should have ok'd it with you first. I don't even make appointments unless I know I am covered.

She should've just said no. Sounds like OP has a long history of skipping over her oldest child because of her ASD and catering to the needs of her neurotypical children in a heartbeat.  I hope she remembers that when she gets thrown in a home.", "Unlikely.\n\nSome people have a victim mentality. I\u2019ll call it as I see it, just the same as you. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Thank you", "The last minute? The last minute of what? She can get the surgery to have the cyst removed whenever, technically. But scheduling the surgery for the end of the year ensures that her health insurance will cover the procedure if she\u2019s met her deductible. This is very standard. This is how people often schedule their appointments/procedures.", "The cyst wall needs to be removed, or it comes right back.  Draining it probably won\u2019t last more than a day.", "If she has anxiety, and arthritis and a walking boot and this and that, then she should darn well know to ask the address *first*. Im not saying the daughter isnt an ahole- she is- but some common sense would have prevented this entire mess.", "I currently have a ganglion in my wrist, and have had it for more than five years. It\u2019s painful when I put weight on certain parts of my hand but otherwise no issues. I would love to get it removed though. It holds me back in the activities I can do. I tried the book smashing but it\u2019s positioned in such a way that I\u2019d sooner break my wrist than pop it. I\u2019m surprised she was able to get an appointment so quickly- where I live there are long waits for elective surgeries.", "OP doesn't mention Dee driving herself as an option at all, so it could be that there are other reasons she needs help with transportation to/from the appointment. No car, no license, etc. Doesn't really change my position anyway. As I said, Dee found transportation so that's really neither here nor there.", "I\u2019ve never been allowed to drive myself home after anything with more than local anesthesia, and have had driving restrictions after any surgery on my upper body that may affect my ability to steer. \nAs in, they had to speak with my ride home before releasing me as well as whoever agreed to stay with me for 24h if it wasn\u2019t the same person driving me.", "There\u2019s no anesthesia here. It\u2019s a cyst removal.", "She waited to *schedule* the surgery until \"the last minute\" of her covered insurance period--the year. Obtuse much?", "It\u2019s a ganglion cyst. You remove them snd they come back in the same spot. Definitely can wait til after the holidays.", "And Dee knowing full well where it was and still said nothing until after OP offered. That\u2019s cold on Dee\u2019s part and I\u2019d call her more of an asshole than OP. Knowledge of a major **recent** anxiety stressor without saying anything will always be more of an AH move than backing out because you didn\u2019t have all the information.\n\nSo many people think they can get away with guilting others into doing shit for them because they don\u2019t give all the info at once. Then once it all is out and the person is unable to, they get pissy that they couldn\u2019t trick them into doing it. So manipulative.", "That doesn't mean there wasn't anesthesia it definitely depends on where the cyst is, if it's skin level probably not, probably just off the top but if it's literally in the joint or something which is common then yeah they would have needed anesthesia\n\n\nCyst removal may be performed under general anesthesia or sedation depending on the size and location.", "It also doesn\u2019t say anywhere that she waited until the last minute to schedule the surgery. None of this is really relevant at all and I\u2019m not sure what your point is.", "She very well could have scheduled this months ago. It's cosmetic. That stuff oftentimes gets pushed out for weeks, if not months", "It can\u2019t wait until after the holidays/into the new year if they don\u2019t have the money to pay for the surgery out of pocket. They\u2019ve likely met their deductible by now.", "Cysts are also not always harmless like the other commenter believes.  I know people who have had various types and some of them cause a great deal of pain and prevent normal activity.  Sure, they may not kill you, but you may be suffering a great deal.  One person I know had one (same type as OP has updated their post to specify their daughter has - ganglion) on their foot and they could barely walk for the pain.  I imagine having it on your wrist or hand could cause a lot of problems trying to work at most jobs.  Or just function in daily life.  The surgery could be quite urgent.", "OP says she gave her 4 days notice. So she either waited to schedule it or waited to ask.", "If she doesn\u2019t drive then maybe she should have scheduled it sooner. She\u2019s a 39 year old woman.", "Yes but the issue here is not the timing. The issue is that her mother offered to drive her but clearly is only comfortable doing so if the hospital is close by because of her anxiety. That wouldn\u2019t change regardless of when the surgery was scheduled. The timing is irrelevant here.", "I mean sure? That wasn\u2019t really my point. You said it could wait until after the holidays, and I mentioned why it may not have been possible to wait. That\u2019s all.", "I, personally, can apply for funding for the dentist if there are any issues because I'm on disability for mental health issues. It wouldn't make sense for me to pay for insurance because that'd be out of pocket. My doctor who oversees my meds etc is great too, because several of my medications come with dry teeth and he's happy to any time write a letter to ensure I do get funding to have my teeth fixed if something happens to them. So, I'm lucky in that sense. But I can't just go to the dentist for hoots, because that I'd have to pay for myself.", "I pay out of pocket for dental and vision. I just don\u2019t buy frames/contacts as often. For dental I put money aside just in case someone needs a filling - we have a jar.", "Y\u2019all are acting like she signed a blood oath. She offered and asked for the address, knowing there are multiple hospitals within 10 minutes. Finds out this hospital is 30 miles away, which (in my area and based on the description) would take between 45 min and 1.5 hours. She withdrew her offer immediately when she realized what the ask actually was, and her daughter is going \u201cno take backs\u201d as if she\u2019s in 3rd grade, and goes on to publicly smear her mother. This is beyond the pale overreaction.", "Yeah, for vision I can go several years before needing new glasses and I use Zenni, which has saved me some money there, so that\u2019s honestly not bad. For dental, that\u2019s exactly what the insurance agent I was speaking about recommended."]}
