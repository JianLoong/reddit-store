That there were cameras all around the house recording her every move. Cameras in the vacuum cleaner, the stereo, hidden in the door and (my personal favourite) in my toothbrush. She dismantled everything she could to try to locate the cameras, and no surprises there were no cameras.\n\nI was a prisoner in our home. If I left the house, even for a moment, she would accuse me of cheating on her. That I must have been with some other woman.\n\nShe would then go through every single chat, message, email, phone call and bank transaction trying to find some evidence of my impropriety. When she was unable to find any evidence on any of the countless occasions she did so, her response was \u201cno evidence means that you did it, but hid it.\u201d I am humbled by her opinion of me, because I know I can\u2019t hide shit.\n\nThis went on for two years, until we finally managed to get the oncologist to at least try stopping the medication.

OP didn't mention kids or pets, and likely would have if they were a viable alternative. Sara likely didn't find the necklace because it was stashed in Amber's undergarments because patting her down would've been over the line. Amber had plenty of notice to hide the necklace, OP said they searched the whole house, unless Amber is a moron, that wouldn't have gone unnoticed.\n\nIt wasn't a breach of Amber's privacy, Sara asked to search the room and she gave consent, she also asked to search her bag, and gave consent.

I hope your wife watches your sister and your family's social media posts for her necklace. Also, you said in \"my\" house, it's your wife's house too.

When she attempted to tell you what about her behavior was suspicious, you stopped her.

IMO that's a little bit of a copout and it makes me wonder if you really know your sister. It's not a difficult thing to hide a stolen object outside of a house.

Can't judge without a reasonable idea of if your wife is/isn't the type of person to misplace things, or if there's a mischievous cat in the house, or if y'all just moved and things are disorganized, or some other plausible explanation besides the person staying in y'all's house moved it. Whether or not an accusation is warranted depends on how certain it is that the person accused has taken it, and I want this info to make that determination before giving judgement.", "NTA. These stories almost never end with the accused having actually taken the thing.
