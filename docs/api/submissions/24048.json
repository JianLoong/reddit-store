I asked her not to and assured her that there was no way Amber would have taken it. Sara didn't sound convinced but didn't say too much, and I had to run to work.\n\nLater that day, when I was driving Amber to the train station, I noticed she seemed upset and was much less chatty than usual, so I asked her what was wrong.

She continued to argue that Amber's behavior had been suspicious, but I interrupted her, stating \"enough.\" I firmly expressed that her accusations were baseless and that she had made my own sister uncomfortable in my house.

She has no real proof to suspect Amber so she's reaching for one. \n\nHas she tried looking behind furniture (behind dressers or bed)? Has she looked through the odd places she may has sat down on or hung around? Could it have accidentally dropped in the bathroom or in a trash can. There's so many places it could go. It's more likely there than in Amber's possession.", "I'm going to say NAH, just to give everyone a bit of \"benefit of the doubt\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe you should have asked about the suspiscious behaviour and heard her out?\n\nI'm not saying you a AH for not asking but I feel communication is clearly an issue here. She over reacted and crossed boundaries with your sister but I feel like you were a bit dismissive of your wifes concerns. you 100 % said your sister wouldn't do it and did not put any effrot to put her mind at easy.\n\nThere were polite ways to solve this without making any accusations or rubbing anyone the wrong way. Like mentioning to your sister that a necklace is missing and you just want to check if it was misplaced in the guest room or maybe it \"fell\" into her bag or she mistoook the necklace for her own. Mistakes happen...kindda vibes instead of accusationary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand as you were in a defensive and angry mental state, but if this necklace is important to her, she might not have been in a clear state of mind  and might be emotional or desperate to find the necklace.\n\nAnd if she seriously thinks your sister was acting suspiciously, then why not hear the full story from your wifes perspective? her perspective might not be 100% baseless.\n\nI don't want to vote anyone a AH, because although she crossed a line theres too many missing factor that I don't know that could explain her behaviour. \n\nedit:\n\nI personally wouldn't feel comfortable accusing a guest - as I know I habitually \"misplace\" stuff. and i would apologise if it came off as accusationary but on the other side of the coin if its never found your wife would constantly wonder if your sister took it?\n\nI feel like the situation could have been resolved/handked much better...", "\\> its not how we were raised.\n\nThats not a good argument. I was raised the exact same as my brother, and he's on drugs- and I've never so much as smoked. We are all more than the rules we were raised under. We grow, we age, we meet new people and we try new things. Some good, some bad. Your sister lives far enough away that she has to stay with you when she visits- how much of what she gets up to do you really know?\n\nWhere IS the necklace?

Did she at least apologize to Amber before AMber left -- you want her too, so assuming she didn't?  That is just over the line to not apologize.  \n\nIs this odd behavior from your wife?  Is there maybe a reason she was so paranoid to the point she thought Amber was suspicious?  Seems like ott so wondering if their is a reason.", "Nta Could Sara have been trying to prevent future visits from Amber or the rest of your family?

This seems to raise questions.", "I have a feeling that if she does find the necklace she\u2019ll get rid of it and not tell anyone about finding it so that she doesn\u2019t look stupid at best or conniving at worst.

And the wife is an ass for violating the privacy of OP\u2019s sister. \n\nWhy should OP have to buy the wife a new necklace when the wife is the one who lost it?

Everything isn't a mental health condition.", "Agree. No sense in humouring ridiculous behaviours.", "If something was misplaced, it would perhaps make sense to ask them to check their own bags.
