It sounds like he\u2019s really oblivious to the fact that other people have actual constraints on their food budgets and what that means in practice when he eats your food. He needs to understand this, and it will likely take a group sit-down and a lot of patience on top.", "NTA \n\nYou are not the asshole, but you do need to address these issues with your flatmate. Not everyone is good at picking up hints. If he is such a lovely person, he likely hasn't gotten the hint. Just sit down and have an open and honest conversation with him about your issues. The longer you keep it bottled up, the worse it will be when you finally explode and it could ruin your friendship.", "NTA but you have to treat him as a flatmate first and friend second in this situation. It\u2019s one of those times where respect is far more important than liking someone in terms of making the relationships you have work.\n\nTalk to him, be direct, explain that no matter what everyone else might say, you expect him to leave your food alone and that he isn\u2019t to eat any of it without agreeing it with you first, and that because your budget is more limited than his, you expect him to replace anything he eats unless you specifically say otherwise.\n\nDon\u2019t make accusations or talk about resentment for how he\u2019s acted to far or any of that - you\u2019re just laying out what you need going forward rather than making any big deal over past misdemeanours.\n\nExplain that you would love to have enough money to be able to share whenever he would like but that at the moment the situation is that if he eats your food, you have to skip a meal or eat less yourself and that isn\u2019t something you are happy with.\n\nDon\u2019t expect or demand apologies, just ask him if he can agree not to do this in future.\n\nIf he is a respectful and kind friend, he should be able to take the discussion in the way it is meant and not be offended or angry; and if he isn\u2019t, then better to find out sooner than later.", "NTA, and you absolutely need to have a conversation with him about these issues.  Communication is a good thing, for both of you.  Honestly, he sounds more oblivious than malicious.  Talking it out will likely help, just letting things fester will not.", "NTA, I guess he thinks since you are friends it's OK and not doing it on purpose ( I mean about the food and inviting himself to your room part). Have an honest conversation with him about your food budget and boundaries.", "NTA\n\nbut....what is pumpkin pasta? Sounds like it could be amazing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When OP says \"I was planning that for 2 meals\", this guy isn't hearing \"I'm on a budget and I need that to last two meals\", he's hearing \"well, I was going to eat it for two nights, so there is enough for both of us.\"  \n\nIf he wants to eat OP's food, and OP is ok with it, then he should pay half the cost.  NTA", "thank you, I didn't know if I was overreacting because my finances have become a worrying subject for me lately.  He only seems to do it to me tho so it's a bit weird?", "thank you for the extensive response, I tend to be a lil resentful and if you hadn't mentioned it I totally would have brought up the times he did it and it annoyed me the most! definitely won't do that. I think he kinda got the message tonight after eating spoonfuls of my left over stir fry and then I mentioned that I was saving that for another meal.", "oh for sure just oblivious! it's just like he's really out of touch with reality and with the inflation in prices of everything because his parents give him money all the time idk", "yeah that's probably why but he's basically friends with everyone in our flat and he only seems to do it to me?", "it's the giovanni rana (spelling?) brand, it's like an autumn themed pasta filled with pumpkin and caramelised onions, I was gonna cook it in a sage butter sauce with parmesan cheese lol", "He may do it to others and they may not be saying anything. Or maybe he only likes your food? Either way, this only concerns the two of you, so it's best you have a private conversation with him. And hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Good luck!"]}
