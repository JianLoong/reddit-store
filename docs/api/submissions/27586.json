Recently she was caught in possession of narcotics and was arrested.\n\nMy sister has always been a popular kid throughout high school meaning she made many friends. In her junior year she had befriend what could be called a \u201cbad kid\u201d. She has just turned 18 around 4 months ago. Unfortunately my sister stayed friends with this girl and eventually got in with the entire group.\n\nI warned my sister countless times to stop hanging out with these people or she would end up in serious trouble. Fast forward to last week and my sister was caught on the other side of town with possession of illegal drugs. Safe to say when cops rolled around her \u201cfriends\u201d spilt and left her with the repercussions.  \n\nCoincidentally, my boyfriend\u2019s older brother is a cop. So he had recognized my sister when she was brought in. He called and told me that my sister was just brought into his station due to possession of drugs.\n\nWhen I finally talked to my sister I could barely make out what she was saying between her hiccups and sobs. She informed me that she had either a $650 bail or 30 days in a detention center since it was only her first offense. I told her that she better make up missing 30 days of school once she was released and then hung up. Eventually the station called our mom. My mother rushed to her \u201clittle angels\u201d aid. Once my sister told our mom how I refused to pay and hung up on her, my mother was furious. \n\nShe said that this was my sister and I should never leave her in such a position. I argued back on how I had warned her countless times to stop hanging out with these people and get real friends. Unfortunately my mom will always take my sisters side. She argued that everyone makes mistakes and that this was only her first one and I should\u2019ve helped her instead of turning my back. She went on to say that when I had tough times in high school my sister was there for me. To which I gently reminded her that my \u201ctough times\u201d were my first breakup and failing AP chem, not being caught with drugs. Though I did see her point in having my sisters back, I refused to fork up such a wad of cash for her mistake or even take the time out of my day to go get her when this was her fault in the first place. She was 18 now and could clearly tell when she was doing something wrong.\n\nMy mother is now ready to fork up any amount of money to \u201chelp\u201d my sister back on the right path. I know my sister isn\u2019t a bad kid but that she just hangs around bad people. Unfortunately, she seeks validation from anything that breathes. So, as long as those kids think she\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d she\u2019ll continue to do their bidding.\n\nMy mother now refuses to talk to me unless I issue my sister a proper apology. I told her I guess this is the last you\u2019ll hear from me then and haven\u2019t spoken to her since.

You already warned your sister. This is just consequences.", "NTA. Your sister made her bed, and she should lie in it. If she did she might learn a valuable lesson. You warned her that her actions had consequences and she didn't listen. Your mother rushing to bail her out may very well lead to your sister continuing on her current path and facing worse consequences down the road. I agree with your decision and don't think you should ever help her with bail or similar things. Your mother's attitude is unfortunate and misguided, I hope she comes around and understands one day why you didn't run to your sister's aid.", "NTA. I had a brother go through something similar. He also cried when taken in and it opened his eyes to how serious things can actually get. It is unfortunate how coddled your mom is towards her but hopefully with your guidance she won\u2019t make the same mistakes again.", "NTA. Supporting your sister doesn\u2019t mean shielding her from the consequences of her actions.", "NTA. You warned her this would happen and it did. Imo the 30 days would have done her good. She needs to learn the consequences of her actions and that mommy can\u2019t bail her out every time.   \n\n\nHopefully With you not doing it and this experience will open her eyes and she\u2019ll stop. But if she doesn\u2019t and ends up getting arrested again then it will be her fault and your moms fault for not disciplining her and brushing a crime off as an \\*Accident\\* \n\nI hope your moms choice to bail her out didn\u2019t get the idea in your sisters head that she can get away with anything because she\u2019ll always have mommy to bail her out.\n\nIf this happens again and your mom can\u2019t bail her out you can tell your mom it\u2019s her fault for not disciplining her after the first time.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is nuts. Is your sister the Golden Child or something the like? \n\nAnd she will not learn from the 30 days. They never do. She wants to be with the cool kids. Your mother isn't learning, either, or she would be enraged at your sister.\n\nBut no. This will go on until your sister gets into serious trouble.\n\nOne thing, though: don't try to contact your mother. And no apology. Never apologize when you're not in the wrong.", "If you can\u2019t do the time don\u2019t do the crime. NTA", "So you're not the AH for not bailing out your sister. That's not your responsibility.\n\nHowever everything else about this post feels off to me. You've been warning your sister for years about her friends? She's your sister not your child - you can warn her once but after that back off and let her live her life.\n\nYou're upset your mom bailed out her \"little angel\"? How does that affect you?\n\nYou sound way too emotionally invested. Again, this is an adult sibling not your minor child. Back off, hope for the best, but don't get involved.", "YTA. It's your Ma's job to deal with your sister's situation, not yours. As for not liking her \"bad kid\" pals, If you don't like her friends now, wait until you see the buddies she makes after being locked up for 30 days with actual seasoned criminals.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She did a crime and that\u2019s her punishment.", "It's not OP's prerogative to choose bail or jail as punishment for her sister, she's neither a caretaker nor a guardian. Nor has little sis been convicted of anything yet.  18 is awful young for someone with no previous criminal history to spend a month with likely more serious offenders.  Which is why I question OP's actual concern about her sis hanging with the \"bad crowd\", if she thinks more of the same/worse will help.  There are better ways which begin with Mom having little sis get a drug test to see if she's using...most jails don't bother with treatment.  This smacks of sibling rivalry at it's worst disguised as \"tough love\" from OP."]}
