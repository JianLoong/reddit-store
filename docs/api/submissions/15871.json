My gf(28F) of two years lives with me and works out of the home. She does not pay rent. \n\n4 months ago, she found 6 two-week-old kittens, 4 female and 2 male, in a box on the side of the road, obviously abandoned. She called me and told me she wanted to take them in. I have a severe cat allergy and can't be around them at all. I was against her plan and suggested she take them to a shelter, pet store or vet clinic where someone else would take them. She kept asking and saying she had no idea if they'd be okay without her and I finally relented, as I'm not some heartless jerk. I said fine, let them in, under the conditions that she started adopting them out at 8 weeks, they stayed in the guest bedroom/bathroom, and I did not have to look after them except for emergencies. \n\nNow it's been four months. They're getting close to the age that it's our responsibility to fix them, which is an expense I don't want. On top of that, she lets them roam the house and tried to get me to clean the cat box for them the other day because she didn't feel like it. It's fucking with my allergies and I keep having to open windows, stay in my room, and constantly wash stuff. I started telling her three weeks ago that if she didn't put them up for adoption, I would and she'd usually ignore me. Finally, I made a post two days ago on Facebook and told her about it. She said alright, and I thought that was that. \n\nA couple of people responded, wanting the cats, so I set up a time yesterday during my lunch break and told her they were going. She said alright again. The people came and four of the cats went to new homes. She got back, saw the cats were gone and flipped her shit. I was frankly stunned because I told her this was happening and I told her there was a post-up and people coming to look at them. But she's angry because I didn't let her say goodbye and other stuff. I think I gave her a full two months of goodbye time. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682646051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131e1mt/aita_for_giving_away_some_of_my_gfs_cats/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty generous.", "I know from a personal standpoint if I was in your girlfriend's position I would be just as upset in the moment, but you are very much NTA in this situation. It was your home, you gave her the conditions that the kittens had to go, they were affected your health, and you went out of your way to find good homes for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt honestly sounds like she was intending on never rehoming them and was hoping to keep putting it off until she could convince you to keep them even when she was showing signs that she would not be a good caretaker of the kittens herself.", ">I have a severe cat allergy.\n\nSo your gf is already an AH for even thinking this was a good idea. Good to know.\n\n>She kept asking and saying she had no idea if they\u2019d be okay without her.\n\nThey would\u2019ve been. She\u2019d just found them.

There was never any plan to get rid of these cats.\n\nShe lets them roam the house, kept them too long, expects you to clean up after them, has no respect for your boundaries and allergy, and doesn\u2019t pay rent. She sounds like a catch /s.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for getting rid of the cats OP, but you are an AH to yourself for letting your gf be so hateful to you.", "I was so ready to call you TA, but after reading, you definitely are NTA. In fact, you\u2019ve been more than patient and understanding. She was given fair warning and alerted every step of the way. She seems to care more about cats (even random, stray ones) than she does you. Are you sure you want that for yourself?", "NTA. Trust me, I'd be quick to call you the AH if you had done it without telling her. But you set expectations up front about how long she could keep them, you gave her extra time, and you communicated everything you did transparently with warning time, which she acknowledged. She very clearly was just trying to ride it out and hope you'd never actually get around to following through. I would be super sad too if I was her because I love kittens, but you handled the situation more than graciously, so she really can't fault you.", "NTA. Feeding the fixed ferals is one thing, but you can't just adopt them and not take care of them.", "NTA. You set your boundaries, and she trampled right over them. And, I say this as a cat person.", "NTA, and I say this as a cat lover.  Even though you have bad allergies, you allowed her to bring the cats into YOUR house, and then instead of dumping them at a shelter, you let them stay and then found them good homes.  What more does she want?", "Nta. Your gf is sneaky and inconsiderate. There are plenty of rescues that are better equipped to care for abandoned kittens. They did not need her the whole she was afraid they wouldn't be okay without her was an emotional manipulation. And a fairly thin one. She never intended to rehome those kittens. She knew they were making you ill and she didn't care. Bottom line was she decided her desire to have an entire litter of kittens was more important than your health. You forewarned her and gave her more courtesy than she deserved. I would have boxed them up and brought them to the animal shelter the very first day.", "**NTA** She is the AH for so many things. First, she brings home 6 kittens and argues with you until you relent, knowing you have a cat allergy. Then she lets the cat loose and wants you to clean the litter box. Then she'd ignore OP when he was trying to communicate the issue. Then OP decides enough is enough and puts them up for adoption. She then gets angry. She also doesn't pay rent. You know I don't really like the people suggesting break-up but, seriously, put her up for adoption.", "NTA. You live together and that means you both be respectful of the other person you're coexisting with. You did your part and compromised by agreeing to take them in under the condition that it would be temporary, which she agreed to. You let her know every step of the process of giving away the kittens, which she also agreed to. Her randomly deciding to get upset now after the fact makes you solidly NTA.", "NTA - Was almost upset with a former girlfriend who put her cat down. Broke her heart to do that. The cat was older and not doing so well, vet said the cat was likely be in pain. The cat was my little buddy and I very much would have liked to say goodbye to him but didn't get the chance. Was upset by that but also would not have wanted the little guy to suffer either. Was more sad he was gone than anything else.", "You are completely NTA about the cat situation, but T A to yourself for the girlfriend situation.", "NTA. The cats and non-paying bed warmer all need to go!", "NTA you have allergies and put up with six cats. That's hard enough for someone without allergies. You working from home means you don't get a break during the day without them around. I hope she comes around to see your side of things.", "NTA Your gf is. Her intentions were good but she just should have followed your original suggestion and taken them to a shelter or a vet. Especially since you're allergic. Two months to say goodbye was more than enough time.", "NTA, except...how do you know the people on FB aren't using them as dog fight bait or some abuse? Did you get a remote fee or any follow up?", "I\u2019m a cat person, and you\u2019re NTA.\n\nYou told her every step of the way, and she said \u201cokay\u201d\n\nAlso it\u2019s not just unhealthy for you, but also for them, to have that many cats in a small space with limited litter boxes.\n\nYou did those cats a favor, honestly.", "NTA - She'll get over it.", "NTA \\~ Both agreed on the terms", "NTA. You relented and she did not uphold the conditions you set that she agreed too. You said people were coming to get the cats, idk what she expected, you to be bluffing, perhaps? Hoping she could make you relent again and let her keep them? She didn't seem to care about your health, which is pretty messed up if you ask me.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a bit manipulative of her to imply that she was the best option for their care ahead of the other options you rightly proposed.", "NTA. First of all, she doesn't pay rent, so who is she to dictate who comes into your apartment? Second, you have an allergy. If she had kept them, you could have had to go to the hospital. Seems like she doesn't care about your health.", "Nta at all, set boundaries and expectations well in advance, gave her plenty of time, not your fault she can't cope", "NTAH.

This is a huge relationship issue. Your gf just showed she doesn't give a shit about your health in your own home. She harassed you into this.

Taking them in initially is great, but once you realize you have more cats than you can afford to care for, it is your responsibility to find them homes where they can receive the care they deserve. \n\nTaking in animals you cannot afford *seems* like an act of love, but when there are other people out there willing to take them and pay for their veterinary care (**especially** when it comes to spaying / neutering), I'd argue that it's actually pretty selfish. It certainly isn't about putting the animal's interest first.", "OP needs to also re-home his girlfriend... Lol", "Lol I'm a dog person as well.

He communicated that he couldn't have the in the house for legit reason. Obviously relented as long as she adopted them out at 8 weeks. What else can he do? She rescued them under conditions she did not uphold. She Obviously doesn't care her bfs health is suffering and was probably just hoping he was bluffing and he would relent again and let her keep them.", "I did tell her they were going and gave her the names of people interested, as well as the time that they were coming to look.
