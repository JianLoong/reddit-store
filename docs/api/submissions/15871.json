My gf(28F) of two years lives with me and works out of the home. She does not pay rent. \n\n4 months ago, she found 6 two-week-old kittens, 4 female and 2 male, in a box on the side of the road, obviously abandoned. She called me and told me she wanted to take them in. I have a severe cat allergy and can't be around them at all. I was against her plan and suggested she take them to a shelter, pet store or vet clinic where someone else would take them. She kept asking and saying she had no idea if they'd be okay without her and I finally relented, as I'm not some heartless jerk. I said fine, let them in, under the conditions that she started adopting them out at 8 weeks, they stayed in the guest bedroom/bathroom, and I did not have to look after them except for emergencies. \n\nNow it's been four months. They're getting close to the age that it's our responsibility to fix them, which is an expense I don't want. On top of that, she lets them roam the house and tried to get me to clean the cat box for them the other day because she didn't feel like it. It's fucking with my allergies and I keep having to open windows, stay in my room, and constantly wash stuff. I started telling her three weeks ago that if she didn't put them up for adoption, I would and she'd usually ignore me. Finally, I made a post two days ago on Facebook and told her about it. She said alright, and I thought that was that. \n\nA couple of people responded, wanting the cats, so I set up a time yesterday during my lunch break and told her they were going. She said alright again. The people came and four of the cats went to new homes. She got back, saw the cats were gone and flipped her shit. I was frankly stunned because I told her this was happening and I told her there was a post-up and people coming to look at them. But she's angry because I didn't let her say goodbye and other stuff. I think I gave her a full two months of goodbye time. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682646051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131e1mt/aita_for_giving_away_some_of_my_gfs_cats/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was never any plan to get rid of these cats.\n\nShe lets them roam the house, kept them too long, expects you to clean up after them, has no respect for your boundaries and allergy, and doesn\u2019t pay rent. She sounds like a catch /s.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for getting rid of the cats OP, but you are an AH to yourself for letting your gf be so hateful to you.", "I was so ready to call you TA, but after reading, you definitely are NTA. In fact, you\u2019ve been more than patient and understanding. She was given fair warning and alerted every step of the way. She seems to care more about cats (even random, stray ones) than she does you. Are you sure you want that for yourself?", "NTA. Trust me, I'd be quick to call you the AH if you had done it without telling her. But you set expectations up front about how long she could keep them, you gave her extra time, and you communicated everything you did transparently with warning time, which she acknowledged. She very clearly was just trying to ride it out and hope you'd never actually get around to following through. I would be super sad too if I was her because I love kittens, but you handled the situation more than graciously, so she really can't fault you.", "NTA. Feeding the fixed ferals is one thing, but you can't just adopt them and not take care of them.", "NTA. You set your boundaries, and she trampled right over them. And, I say this as a cat person.", "NTA, and I say this as a cat lover.  Even though you have bad allergies, you allowed her to bring the cats into YOUR house, and then instead of dumping them at a shelter, you let them stay and then found them good homes.  What more does she want?", "Nta. Your gf is sneaky and inconsiderate. There are plenty of rescues that are better equipped to care for abandoned kittens. They did not need her the whole she was afraid they wouldn't be okay without her was an emotional manipulation. And a fairly thin one. She never intended to rehome those kittens. She knew they were making you ill and she didn't care. Bottom line was she decided her desire to have an entire litter of kittens was more important than your health. You forewarned her and gave her more courtesy than she deserved. I would have boxed them up and brought them to the animal shelter the very first day.", "**NTA** She is the AH for so many things. First, she brings home 6 kittens and argues with you until you relent, knowing you have a cat allergy. Then she lets the cat loose and wants you to clean the litter box. Then she'd ignore OP when he was trying to communicate the issue. Then OP decides enough is enough and puts them up for adoption. She then gets angry. She also doesn't pay rent. You know I don't really like the people suggesting break-up but, seriously, put her up for adoption.", "NTA. You live together and that means you both be respectful of the other person you're coexisting with. You did your part and compromised by agreeing to take them in under the condition that it would be temporary, which she agreed to. You let her know every step of the process of giving away the kittens, which she also agreed to. Her randomly deciding to get upset now after the fact makes you solidly NTA.", "NTA - Was almost upset with a former girlfriend who put her cat down. Broke her heart to do that. The cat was older and not doing so well, vet said the cat was likely be in pain. The cat was my little buddy and I very much would have liked to say goodbye to him but didn't get the chance. Was upset by that but also would not have wanted the little guy to suffer either. Was more sad he was gone than anything else.", "You are completely NTA about the cat situation, but T A to yourself for the girlfriend situation.", "NTA. The cats and non-paying bed warmer all need to go!", "NTA you have allergies and put up with six cats. That's hard enough for someone without allergies. You working from home means you don't get a break during the day without them around. I hope she comes around to see your side of things.", "NTA Your gf is. Her intentions were good but she just should have followed your original suggestion and taken them to a shelter or a vet. Especially since you're allergic. Two months to say goodbye was more than enough time.", "NTA, except...how do you know the people on FB aren't using them as dog fight bait or some abuse? Did you get a remote fee or any follow up?", "I\u2019m a cat person, and you\u2019re NTA.\n\nYou told her every step of the way, and she said \u201cokay\u201d\n\nAlso it\u2019s not just unhealthy for you, but also for them, to have that many cats in a small space with limited litter boxes.\n\nYou did those cats a favor, honestly.", "NTA - She'll get over it.", "NTA \\~ Both agreed on the terms", "NTA. You relented and she did not uphold the conditions you set that she agreed too. You said people were coming to get the cats, idk what she expected, you to be bluffing, perhaps? Hoping she could make you relent again and let her keep them? She didn't seem to care about your health, which is pretty messed up if you ask me.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a bit manipulative of her to imply that she was the best option for their care ahead of the other options you rightly proposed.", "NTA. First of all, she doesn't pay rent, so who is she to dictate who comes into your apartment? Second, you have an allergy. If she had kept them, you could have had to go to the hospital.

Taking them in initially is great, but once you realize you have more cats than you can afford to care for, it is your responsibility to find them homes where they can receive the care they deserve. \n\nTaking in animals you cannot afford *seems* like an act of love, but when there are other people out there willing to take them and pay for their veterinary care (**especially** when it comes to spaying / neutering), I'd argue that it's actually pretty selfish.

She was putting this off because she didn't want to give them up, but it wasn't sustainable. Unless she intended to get her own place and keep them all (and was able to afford caring for 6 cats long term), she did not have their best interests in mind, but her own emotions.

You have no way of knowing how someone will care for an animal from a brief visit at your house. Truly horrible things can happen to animals given away for free, from going to a negligent situation to being used as dog-fighting bait (where they will be killed, horrifically). Please reach out to the people you gave the kittens to and demand in-home visits ASAP, and find a well-regarded, no-kill rescue to adopt out the other two kittens for you. It seems like you may have been trying to do the right thing, but you have to be really, really careful and not just give animals away to people from Facebook.\n\nYour girlfriend is hugely T-A for bringing cats to your home for any longer than necessary (a few nights at most while looking for someone to foster the kittens). And also for keeping them longer than agreed upon, for asking you to do any caring for them, for letting them roam in your area, and for blowing you off when you said you were going to find homes for them.
