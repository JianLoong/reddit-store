It's a simple thing to have slipped out of your mouth from habit. It's reasonable for them to ask you to say Zee.

Or that you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re from the UK so you shouldn\u2019t be \u201cappropriating\u201d it? Or is it possible there are people in the meeting who aren\u2019t aware zed is another way to pronounce zee and they hate explaining it? Whatever their reasoning it\u2019s their issue, not yours.

In my opinion, it\u2019s quite rude to ask you to adapt in this context. I don\u2019t know why Z-ed would be hard to understand. I do know Americans who use it such as military and a lot of elderly. There\u2019s also some regions in America it\u2019s more common and it\u2019s not like Canadian and British media is obscure in America.
