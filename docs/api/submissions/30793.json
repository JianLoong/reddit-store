He asked me why and I told him that i don\u2019t have kids and I shouldn\u2019t be forced to look after his kids without being paid. \n\nHe got angry and called me many names under the sun. I called him a deadbeat dad and he got in his car and speed away. \n\nIt now Sunday and I\u2019ve had multiple family members called me a horrible person and that I need to look after his kids.\n\nIt was pretty ugly and he now wants me to give my flat so his kids have somewhere else to stay and I would move back into my parents house.\n\n I\u2019m honestly not sure what to do at this point I don\u2019t want to give my flat up but his kids need a home but I don\u2019t want to move out so he can\u2019t body about more things he don\u2019t work for.", "created_utc": 1699741868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17t5su7/aita_i_called_my_entitled_brother_a_deadbeat_dad/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And sticking to those two lines. You shouldn\u2019t be paying for him, and baby sitting his kids means you arne\u2019t getting paid to work somewhere else. Even if you don\u2019t actually work those hours somewhere else you need time to do things you can\u2019t do when you do work. Your time is worth money. Tell them all to pick up the babysitting hours, and help with his housing, and then take a looooooooong time to remember to read any texts as from any of them.

He\u2019s always going to want what you have. I\u2019m betting he wants and expects you to give up your flat and still pay the rent.

Tell them you are not giving permission for anyone and to call you if he tries. Then you email/text everyone that since they think you should babysit his kids at anytime with no money a schedule will be drawn up and all of them will be assigned shifts.
