{"id": 9269, "submission_id": "10v6rmr", "title": "AITA for taking pictures of him while he sleeps?", "selftext": "A lot of elements here. Please ask for info if needed. My fiance Matthew is constantly telling everyone that I hog the entire bed and that he has all of 6 inches of bed to sleep on every night. Claims he got no sleep because of me. He doesn't say it maliciously but it's become the butt of the joke and gets brought up often. Now the thing is, it's a bold faced lie. I'm an insomniac and during the night I wake up at least 3 times, if not more, and every single time I wake up I'm pushed all the way to the edge of the bed to a point of my legs being half off because he takes up the entirety of the rest of the bed and is right on top of me practically. Countless times I've woken up to his arm over my face, his legs up over me, etc while I'm basically dangling off the bed with no blankets. So not only are his stories a lie but it's the complete opposite of what he tells people. \n\nOther element, my fiance hates having his picture taken. Any time I try taking a picture of him he will tell me to stop. We have been together 5 years and we have maybe 3 pictures together. I think his most recent photos on social media are from like 6-7 years ago. He just hates it. It does bother me because I'm the opposite. I take a lot of pictures. Not of myself but if everything else. Places we go, friends, our animals, etc. I love pictures (I'm also a photographer) and I don't post these photos anywhere. They are simply for me to look back at as fond memories. But he hates it either way and I eventually stopped trying to photograph any memory of him because of how bad it pissed him off and having him make me feel stupid about it (him calling me pretentious or \"cliquey\" for taking so many photos). But after he started lying to everyone about the sleeping issues and making out like it was all me and that he's not sleeping, etc, I started taking pictures of him sleeping to show him how untrue this is. Yesterday he made a comment about me sleeping up his ass all night. I knew it was a lie because I had woken up at 3am and he was practically on top of me and I ended up getting out of bed and staying up. So I showed him the pictures I had taken over the course of the week and told him he can stop lying and making out like I'm the problem when it's him. He immediately got pissed and said I violated his privacy and a few pictures don't prove anything. AITA?\n\nETA: I didn't do it as a petty revenge scheme. I did it to prove to him that he is making it all up so he would stop lying to everyone every single time we talk to people because I'm getting tired of being the butt of the joke and it being talked about constantly. I can't even hang out with mutual friends anymore without several of them bringing up the fact that I \"don't let him sleep\". I've brought it up to him several times prior to taking the photos and he always said I was lying and \"clearly didn't know\" my own sleeping patterns and that it's \"just a joke\".", "created_utc": 1675690538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v6rmr/aita_for_taking_pictures_of_him_while_he_sleeps/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re a photographer, and he calls you pretentious and cliquey for taking photos? Why are you with him?", "NTA at all, and I strongly urge you to hold off with marriage until you two can get on the same page regarding life. \n\nThe fact that he keeps on lying about your sleeping, and is making you a butt of jokes amongst your friend is absolutely not acceptable. He is showing no regard for you, and I would be really surprised if this lack of regards for your feelings doesn't spill in other area of your life.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you were forced into a corner here.  You need to have a serious talk about him about respect.  It is supposed to be about lifting one another up, not one person (you) being a foil to make the other (him) look good.  This serves him right.", "NTA.  But your fiance is slandering you (no matter how minor it may seem), makes you feel stupid for something that you are passionate about, and overreacts when you attempt to gain evidence to prove that he is lying about you?  You're supposed to build each other up, not break each other down.  And this is happening before you're even married.  These are permanent behaviors that will occur for the rest of your life, and won't stop at falsely blaming you for his lack of sleep and making you unsure about continuing your passion.  Talk to him, see if he dismisses your concerns.", "NTA, he made a claim and you disproved him, that's why he's pissed. If you're not showing the photos to anyone then it's perfectly fine.", "NTA He's TA for blaming you in front of friends. If he's got a problem with you sleeping that is worth joking about, he's got a problem worth working out with you and it doesn't sound like he's made an effort to do so. You might be kind of an AH for taking pictures when he has specifically told you not to, but clearly you needed to move the conversation forward and I'm not sure how else you could have done it. I would be looking for a bigger bed or separate beds. Chronically losing sleep like this is not healthy for you (especially for someone already prone to insomnia).", "NTA but love if you have been driven to this by the way he speaks about you I'm not sure he should be your fiance.\n\nSee also where you said he makes you feel stupid for wanting to take photos of events and occasions.\n\nYou may be being an asshole to yourself putting up with any of this.", "NTA\n\nThe blatant lying is unacceptable, silly joke or otherwise. Coming from experience this is how it starts if you don\u2019t shut it down, he\u2019ll lie about other things\n\nHating pictures to the point of not wanting any to be taken of him is also very strange. I personally don\u2019t like having my picture taken and I don\u2019t take selfies but I find it odd he can\u2019t make an exception for when you want to capture memories. Couple of red flags here.", "NTA you have told him that his version isn't the truth, how else would you prove it to him.\n\nHe sounds like a lot of work though tbh", "NTA. Why do you want to marry someone who lies about something so innocuous to all of your friends lmfao", "NTA, there's a few red flags in this post that are concerning.\n\nHe's slandering you to your friends and circle.\nHe makes you feel bad for regular relationship photos. \n\nWhile I'm not going to jump up and down and say don't marry him... These can be the top of the red flag iceberg. I would proceed with caution.", "This sounds like more of an everyone sucks here situation, but it's disproportionate so I'm going to say NTA.\n\nLook, taking pictures of someone when they're sleeping is creepy unless they know you do it and are ok with that. He's obviously not. Granted, you're not showing the photos off to anyone except him, but it's not cool, knock it off.\n\nHe's the bigger AH though - it'd be one thing if it was a joke you both found funny. It's very clearly not - he's trash-talking you and it's obviously bothering you (and quite a bit!). That's really awful.\n\nYou sure you want him to be your fiance?", "NTA IF you only showed him then deleted them. Sounds like he's a tosser and now that there is a body in bed he is now realizing it. He shouldn't been saying these things without trying to sort things out with you. If you two are actually happy and looking on staying together might I suggest you two sleep in different beds. Couples don't need to sleep in the same bed. If he can't forgive you and accept he's might be the problem the maybe you two might not be ment.", "NTA. It\u2019s wild that he was even making this issue the butt of a joke anyway when he was probably just sleeping through every night. You took the photos and only showed them to him, it\u2019s hardly a violation of privacy. I\u2019d call that evidence.\n\nThe other concern here is you being a photographer and him calling you pretentious. This seems quite disrespectful.", "Why is he telling people about your sleeping habits?", "INFO Before you took the pictures, did you try to talk to him about why he is repeatedly saying this lie? If not why not; if so, what was his reaction?", "NTA. You've talked to him and he brushes it off and keeps you as the butt of a joke that isn't even true.", "Info: Why does your fiance think your sleeping habits are so worthy of conversation with other people? He's the AH for subjecting people to such a boring topic.", "NTA. I personally think it\u2019s fair. He keeps annoying you and you \u201cannoyed\u201d him in your way, maybe he will learn from that.", "I feel like this is the case where there are too many things popping up - like why are you with someone who thinks something your passionate about is \u201ccliquey\u201d lol which is weird af, but also, he is trashing you to his friends and repeatedly bringing your business up and he\u2019s lying about it, like forget that this is about sleeping, this is a problem regardless. NTA", "Nta, you wouldn't have had to provide proof of he would just calm down on the joke..", "NTA. If you can, each have your own bedrooms. My spouse and I struggled to cosleep for the first 7 years of our relationship. Once we got our own beds, it was a total game changer.", "NTA- and how many other things that you love does he put down? Seems like he wants you to feel bad about your photography and wants you to feel belittled around friends. Are the movies you like also bad to him? You favorite foods? Maybe your job?", "NTA. He is. Telling little lies like that to belittle you is a huge red flag.", "NTA As a woman, the no pictures thing is throwing me off. It\u2019s often a habit of someone who\u2019s cheating and doesn\u2019t want to be seen in a relationship but I can\u2019t make that judgement off of one post. He may be insecure and you should approach him and ask him to be open minded and talk about why he doesn\u2019t like his picture taken, because you live taking photos. If he\u2019s a good man he\u2019ll either compromise, or communicate his reasons. You should also please please communicate that being the butt of the joke is making you insecure. I know it feels like it shouldn\u2019t be up to you to be the more mature person. Communicate that too! If he refuses to listen that\u2019s when you really truly re-evaluate your relationship values. You\u2019ll get a lot of people saying to leave him. I\u2019d say communicate, ask him to be open minded, and stay open minded yourself.", "I going with \u201cmostly\u201d NTA .  I don\u2019t love that you took pictures of him given you know how much it bothers him, but I think all the negative stuff he is doing justifies it.\n\nHe seems intent on putting you down, both privately and publicly.  \n\nHis comments about your photography were belittling.  It also seems bad enough that I wonder if he hates having his photo taken as much as he says or if it\u2019s just a way to control you because he knows how much you would love one.\n\nI felt the same about the hogging the bed stories .  He doesn\u2019t just bring it up as an occasional joke with his friends.  It\u2019s a frequent topic of conversation to the point that they talk to you about it. He also criticizes you about it when you are alone.  And none of it is true.  Honestly I think he was more upset that you had evidence that he was making it all up than he was about the photographs themselves.\n\nMaybe this is all tied to him being self-conscious  about his size and having serious self-esteem issues, but you shouldn\u2019t become a victim of his insecurities.", "NTA. \n\nHim taking up the whole space and saying you're crowding him because you're still there forced to press against the closest part of him is a pretty big red flag. You would be the asshole if you showed any of these photos as evidence to the random other people he has brought into the debate, but he presumably has no problem with you seeing him sleep every night, so having a recording of his annoying behavior that only the two of you ever see shouldn't be such a problem unless he can explain why it is to him (in a way that's not just getting defensive because he has been proven wrong and didn't expect to have to deal with anything other than two competing narratives.)\n\nThat being said, sounds like either a bigger bed or separate ones or something might be useful here. And, you know, more communication about boundaries in general.", "NTA. I would be concerned about what his gaslighting of the bed sharing situation means to the relationship. Is he quick to blame other things on you as well or is it just the sleep thing?\n\nAnd you didn\u2019t adhere to preference but you did not violate his privacy. You were in the room with him, and only you had access to the photo. No private information was shared without authorization. \n\nHe also prefers blaming random problems on you. Not all preferences deserve to be honored unconditionally.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get making the occasional joke about being a bed hog. But to do so frequently and consistently is nuts. Doing it the point you felt you needed photographic evidence to get him to stop doing it, and then he gets mad it you, is wrong on so many levels.

They document it, the truth, to keep from believing the lies. A bit of a dramatic way of putting it sure, but that's what he's doing to you, worse he's bringing your circle of friends into it to also question you. \"How could you not let him sleep?\" as if you're maliciously keeping him from sleeping.. but you're not, you know this. He gets mad about the pictures you take because you love them and he's probably insecure, wants nothing out of his control. He calls you clique-y and other mean things to belittle you and your passions, at least that's how it rings for me when I read your post. You're already doing amazing by not allowing yourself to believe his lies about your reality, but you really should just leave him tbh. Women are most happy when single and childless I saw online, while men are happiest married and with children. Funny that, how opposite.

The pictures literally are proof. He's just refusing to admit that he's wrong. I'm guessing he refuses to admit that he's wrong at other times.

He's being an AH by continuing to tell people you're a sucky sleep partner even after you asked that it stopped. \n\nHe's being an AH by sharing this intimate thing with people who have no right to know, after you've asked him to stop.\n\nBut despite how people seem to count it as gossip on this sub, it IS normal to discuss relationship problems with your friends. That's how people get advice, it's how they get help, and it's not.\n\nHe's an AH for talking poorly about your photography, because it's something you love and people in a relationship should support each other.\n\nAnd you are an AH for continuing to take his photo after the FIRST time he asked you to stop. \n\nHe has a right to hate having his photo taken, and you need to respect that. Your desire to *preserve* memories, does not outweigh his right to his own image and identity.\n\nI cannot imagine that you haven't made *him* feel stupid or wrong about this throughout your relationship, since your disdain for his feelings about this comes through *so clearly* in just 2 paragraphs. For that you're an AH as well.\n\nBut to photograph him after you've agreed not to? Major AH.\n\nTo photograph anyone sleeping without express consent? Giant AH\n\nTo expressly photograph someone who has asked you not to, when you've *agreed* not to, *while they are sleeping*, not only without consent, but in direct violation of their right to consent, is not just some level of AH, it is completely unacceptable.\n\nAnd to do any of that to *prove a point* is so childish and selfish and entitled, it frankly bothers me to think about it.\n\nEveryone sucks here, and you two people should not be in any kind of a relationship. He can't stop talking shit about you, you think he's a liar and a drama queen, he has no respect for your career and you can't respect basic boundaries. Everyone sucks and you should probably break up.\n\nSee, THAT is what you had the right to do if he didn't stop talking about the sleep issue. Talk it out reach an accord, and if you can't, part ways. But no, you had no right to take this man's photo.\n\nThey aren't your memories. Memories are in your mind. They're *his* photos.\n\nYou fucked up here, whether reddit agrees or not, and I wouldn't be  surprised if he dumped you. You DID violate his privacy.\n\nAnd he's right. A few photos from the times you *weren't* sleeping (cause you were taking them) don't prove you aren't a bed hog when you *are* sleeping. \n\nYou're probably not, but who cares?

He didn't and kept lying.\n\nHow is that a communication issue on her part?\n\nWhat other *specific* communication should she be engaging in?", "It does answer you. \n\nCrazy concept - a relationship should be able to solve issues without resorting to violating trust. \n\nI know, wild.", "You didn't, because you knew she'd already done that and it didn't work.\n\nShe HAS communicated. \n\nIt did not work.\n\nSo...what does she do?\n\nWhat else should she be communicating?", "Just because something has not worked does not give somebody the right to violate somebody. \n\nBonkers concept.", "She should leave the relationship. That's the other option.\n\nYou don't get to pretend consent doesn't exist just to prove a point.\n\nShe tried communicating, he refuses to listen, good reason to leave.\n\nNot a good reason to violate his trust when he's SLEEPING.", "I didn't argue it does.\n\nI said *what is your solution?*\n\nThe one you proposed has **already not worked.**", "I'm NOT pretending consent doesn't exist. \n\nI've NEVER condoned her actions, so stop pretending I did. \n\nWhy do you keep acting as though I'm debating that fucking point? \n\nYour \"solutions\" aren't solutions. \n\nThey're *do something she already did* or **nuke the relationship.**\n\nThese aren't useful in any way.\n\nBut why was it okay for him to violate her over and over? You're not addressing that privacy or trust violation at all."]}
