In her will, she bequeathed it to me specifically, stating that she wanted me to have it due to my deep passion for music. I've been playing the piano since I was a child, and she always appreciated my connection to it. \n\nHowever, my current living situation doesn't allow for such a large item. I live in a small apartment in the city, and the piano has been in storage for the last 5 years, incurring monthly storage fees. Recently, I've faced some financial hardships, and after careful consideration, I decided to sell the piano. I used the money to pay off some debts and set aside a portion for my future, possibly for a down payment on a house.\n\nWhen my family found out, they were furious. Many feel that the piano should've remained in the family and passed down to future generations. They argue that its sentimental value far outweighs any monetary gains.\n\nI understand their sentiments, but I also felt burdened by the costs of storage and the practicalities of my situation. The piano wasn't being used or enjoyed, and I believed selling it was a beneficial decision for my future.\n\nSo, AITA for selling the family heirloom, even though it was legally mine?", "created_utc": 1698264999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gdyvz/aita_for_selling_the_family_heirloom_even_though/", "score": 799, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know you didn't make that decision lightly.  I honestly believe you grandmother wanted you to have the piano to enjoy.  I can't imagine she wanted you to be burdened by it. When it ceased to be a source of joy, she would not want you to be burdened by it. That's the emotional bit.  The legal bit:  it was yours, yours alone.

That is, ONLY your children and grandchild would ever have a claim to it, unless someone offered to buy it from you at it's full value.  People's lives have changed.  You need to have a very stable living arrangement to own a grand piano.  No one seems to have cared that it was sitting and wasting away.   Most people today don't have that kind of permanent attachment to a place.  It was yours.  Unless someone had told you, repeatedly, I might add, that if you ever wanted to get rid of it they wanted the chance to buy it off you before you did something else with it.

In her will, she bequeathed it to me specifically, stating that she wanted me to have it due to my deep passion for music. I've been playing the piano since I was a child, and she always appreciated my connection to it. \n\nHowever, my current living situation doesn't allow for such a large item. I live in a small apartment in the city, and the piano has been in storage for the last 5 years, incurring monthly storage fees. Recently, I've faced some financial hardships, and after careful consideration, I decided to sell the piano. I used the money to pay off some debts and set aside a portion for my future, possibly for a down payment on a house.\n\nWhen my family found out, they were furious. Many feel that the piano should've remained in the family and passed down to future generations. They argue that its sentimental value far outweighs any monetary gains.\n\nI understand their sentiments, but I also felt burdened by the costs of storage and the practicalities of my situation. The piano wasn't being used or enjoyed, and I believed selling it was a beneficial decision for my future.\n\nSo, AITA for selling the family heirloom, even though it was legally mine?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Otherwise, the piano could have stayed there til OP can take it)", "Fallacy of division.  Overall evidence such items are not wanted is not proof it was not wanted in this case.  Also, even if it were true, there would be no harm in giving the family right of first refusal and then selling it if nobody stepped up.", "As someone with this albatross, I can confirm. Family like the *idea* of it staying in the family but NO ONE wanted to take it, even for free. NTA", "Sure, but some people do buy and own them, it\u2019s literally impossible for you to know whether they would have chosen to buy it from OP because he didn\u2019t bother to ask.", "And yet, someone bought it, strange if it's such a massive burden and inconvenience. I doubt it was purchased for firewood.", "I have a house that's plenty big. The piano would look great by the fireplace just as decoration even if it never got used.", "But it's legal, so fuck em? Ain't their comment, they can say what they like?", "How is it \u201cover their own relative\u201d?\n\nThe issue here is that OP didn\u2019t care enough about their relatives to keep an heirloom in the family. \n\nBy OP\u2019s own account here, her relatives are much more respectful of family than they are, since OP didn\u2019t even consider their family here.", "I think you're entirely missing the point. It's not a material item. It's a piece of the family's history. An extremely sentimental item wrapped up in the memories of several generations of family members. It doesn't matter if it's a knitting needle, it's precious. And, apparently, op believes it is worth more than actual flesh and blood relatives because they've just blown up all their relationships by selling it. Also, not a 'middle class rich people thing'. Very, very working class over here and still in agreement that they should have had a conversation first.", "Sounds like the OP is the one who didn't think the flesh and blood relatives mattered.", "to you its a grand piano but to the family it was much more....if that doesnt make sense then you probably cant understand why some people would get mad over this.", ">I can distinguish from asshole moves and the opposite\n\nApparantly not.", "Selling an heirloom without giving your other relatives a chance to buy it is an asshole move. Doesn't matter if it's a piano or a hammer.", "Selling something a member of your family loves without giving them first refusal is an asshole move. Doesn't matter if it's a ring, a piano or another item.", "It is if it's a sentimental family heirloom. At least, it is if you do it without giving the rest of the family a chance to buy it first. If they say no, fair enough, sell it, at least you gave them the choice. But not giving them the chance to keep it in the family first? Yeah, that's an AH move. Just because you can do something legally, doesn't mean you should.", "No harm? OP avoided all the guilt trips and lowballing that would ensue\u2014and got paid. Still would have had to pay for storage for however long it took for family to realize they didn\u2019t want it, and certainly not for anything close to what OP could get for it. OP was smart to get ahead of the nonsense that would *inevitably* ensue, because whether you want to believe it or not, *no one wants the grand piano*.", "Yeah usually you have to give them away so OP did really well tbh", "That is such a waste of money and effort in this economy", "Thx for making me laugh", "Thats stupid", "Oh well I'm sure the family will get over it", "And just because the family cares doesn't mean they have to get a say", "Yes, no harm.  The guilt trips are still happening, and are worse because the OP has no ethical leg to stand on.  A deadline could have been given to control the storage fee issue, and the price is something that could also be controlled.  You are again assuming no one wanted the piano, just because in other cases people didn't want it.", "You must rent an apartment since you can't fathom owning a piano. And you are very wrong, it's easy to find buyers because antique grand pianos cam be very valuable.", "Not much for the sentimental value.", "You do realize that if it's sold, SOMEONE is going to have it in their house or stage or even their own storage? The economy is irrelevant at that point, it can't be sold if someone doesn't have the money and space for it", "To you. But not to the majority of people.", "You are definitely the asshole in this thread. Only you wouldn't have enough humanity to actually ask. \n\nCongratulations.", "Unlikely. An heirloom is irreplaceable.", "Ah yes \"Oh well, the offended party will get over over it\" the mantra of assholes everywhere.", "Eventually yes, but without OP in their live. Guess the piano was worth more then the sentimental value it had to the family.", "Tell me you lack empathy without telling me you lack empathy.", "We get it already - you're pro-asshole.", "No, no one wanted it because no one ever offered to buy it, nor did they ever express interest in it. And it\u2019s much easier and better to deal with guilt trips when you\u2019re already paid, which would never have happened if OP had made the mistake of opening up about selling the grand piano that no one would have wanted to pay anything near its value because no one wanted it in the first place. I\u2019m not assuming, if there had been interest it would have already been expressed.", "Are you paying rent or mortgage?"]}
