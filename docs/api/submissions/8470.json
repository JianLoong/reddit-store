She has a history of going against my wishes because \u201cshe\u2019s an adult and can do what she wants\u201d. She had a difficult childhood and has not received any help in dealing with her trauma, so we collectively just put up with her behavior. I have dealt with this by moving away and being low contact, but we do see each other at least once a month so she can spend time with my child (8M).\n\nThe story: A few weeks ago, she was at my house and found a pregnancy test, and asked me about it. I confirmed that I was very newly pregnant and didn\u2019t want to tell anyone else because it was VERY early. I explicitly asked her not to tell my Dad because I wanted to be there when he found out, and I knew he would immediately tell everyone else he knows. She agreed and said she understood completely. Today, I told her everything was looking good so I\u2019d be comfortable if we told my Dad. The conversation went like this:\n\nMom:\u201dI already told him\u201d\n\nMe: *deep breath* \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cIt was on the ride home from your house last week, or maybe it was sooner than that, but the point is I waited\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that you waited, I explicitly asked you not to.\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cI could have lied and said he didn\u2019t know, at least I told you now\u201d\n\nMe:\u201dThat doesn\u2019t make it better. And Dad would have told me the truth. You absolutely knew I didn\u2019t want anyone else to know\u201d\n\nMom:\u201dWell I definitely think you should be the one to tell your brother.\u201d\n\nMe:\u2026\u2026*deep breath*\u201dDo you not understand why I\u2019m upset about this?\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cNo\u201d\n\nMe:\u201dHave a good day\u201d *click*\n\nI. Am. Livid.\nNot only did she take away that moment with me and my Dad, but she has no understanding of why  that was not Ok or why I would be hurt.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may wrong: In a month we are supposed to go away for the weekend with her and my son. I cannot trust her to take him by herself because she gives him things he\u2019s not medically allowed to have and completely ignores me when I try to set boundaries. This was kind of a final straw moment for me and I really do not want to go.\n\nI feel like I shouldn\u2019t be as upset because I knew in my heart that she was probably going to tell him because of her pattern of behavior. I\u2019m more upset about the way she reacted after telling me that she had broken my trust. My son has no idea we were planning to go away, and I can take him away another weekend.

Tell her exactly why the trip is cancelled, that you can\u2019t trust her to respect your boundaries. I would never let her around my children if she is giving them things they can\u2019t medically have anyway.

Perhaps this will help her to learn that.", "NTA. Cancel it. If you go on holiday you are basically telling her it's okay for her to do what she did. And, also, if she does not respect your boundaries and wishes related to your son to the point you can't let her unsupervised for long with him, it shows your boundaries are not being respected at all. I would consider this when talking to her again.", "NTA, how did she even find the test in the first place? Just wondering if she snooped, cuz if she is a snooper and a blabber mouth all encounters with her would happen at her house or public places, would not trust her in my house. Would also not allow her near my child, supervised or not, even for a small meet up, much less an entire weekend. With people like that, all it takes is a moment's distraction from the parents and little Timmy is given a packet of M&M's and instructions to not tell the caregiver even though he is allergic to chocolate", "NTA, now is a great time to correct some shitty behavior.", "NTA \n\nShe is untrustworthy.

Your mother seems to not care about any of your wishes (the thing with your dad, but also with your son). \n\nCancle the vacation and tell her why. It doesn't sound like she would get it. But as a reason for you, so you will not let yourself be gaslighted back into doing the trip. Maybe also think about limiting the contact for a while. Or just not telling her anything more about the pregnety. If she asks, tell her, she can't keep a secret so she will not get any more.", "NTA - her childhood is not your responsibility.  She is an adult, if she had trauma in her childhood, she is capable of getting help for it.  As a child, you have no choices and had to comply with her behavior.  But you are an adult with kids.  You are not obligated to \u201cput up\u201d with her behavior.  Also, your primary responsibility is to provide a safe and loving home for your child. You are not obligated to provide her with access to your child.  As a matter of fact, you have an obligation to withhold access to your child because she cannot be trusted with your child.  If you continue to allow access, you are teaching your child that her behavior is ok and you putting up with it is ok and her potentially giving him foods harmful to his medical condition is ok, unless you are watching her\u2026\n\nI think you need to step back and recognize that you are no longer a child and forced to comply with her desires.  You are an adult and responsible for providing your children with good examples of behavior because your child will view any behavior they see as normal unless you teach them that it is not normal.  And if you are exposing them to bad behaviors, you are teaching them that it is ok.  They will use what they learn as a child to model their relationships with friends and partners in the future.\n\nThink back to your childhood.  If you could pick, would you have chosen to live with your mother and put up with the abuse?  Or would you have chosen parents who didn\u2019t expose you to her behaviors??  Is this what you want for your child??\n\nYou do not owe your mother a relationship with your children.  You owe your children a safe and peaceful home with good behavior modeled for them.", "NTA", "NTA - If people kill your joy, don't force yourself to be around them.  You are also an adult, and can do what you want.
