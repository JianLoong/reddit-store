What an unreasonable request. \n\nNTA. Good luck with having her around, if this is any indication of her behaviour, these next two months are going to feel like a decade lol", "NTA. Treadmill are not cheap and if she'll be the only one using it, I see no valid reason to buy one. \nIf it's so important to her to see exercise she can take your offer for the gym membership or find and alternative routine for 2 months. \nI don't know if it was she who volunteered to help you with your baby, but paying for the gym can also be a way to thank her for the help.\nBe sure to resolve the situation before she come, especially in regards of childcare and her own routine.", "NTA, Why is it her way or no way?  You offered her a gym membership, this is a perfectly reasonable compromise.", "NTA: Dear lord - she's supposed to be coming to help you with the child right? Sounds like she's going to be more work for you and your husband.\n\nTell her absolutely no way will you get a treadmill for her. She can either walk the neighborhood or sit on the couch or *stay home.*", "NTA.\n\nYou are not required to get a treadmill when there are viable alternatives as you suggested - walking outside or short-term gym membership.\n\nMIL is trying to be controlling.  Have your spouse talk with her and enforce the boundary.\n\nAlso, you do not have to travel that often.  They can come to you, even without a treadmill.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house, and treadmills are frankly bulky and ugly", "It might be the kind of equipment you can rent.", "INFO are there any particular reasons she\u2019s so adamant about walking for hours every day? It definitely sounds quite extreme to be running asking that much regularly. Three hours at a regular pace would but her at easily 9 miles a day. \n\nMaybe a walking pad could be an alternative if she\u2019s not running. They can easily slide under a bed when not in use and are significantly cheaper and lighter than a traditional treadmill.", "There\u2019s a hidden issue here: it seems your MIL uses treadmill walking as her way to cope with stress. I say this because so the several hours a day she spends on the treadmill, and her inability to go without it for even a few days. \n\nWhy is this important?  You seem to think this issue is about a piece of workout equipment, when it\u2019s really about how MIL copes with daily life. \n\nIf you don\u2019t make a treadmill available to her, it\u2019s a really big deal to her. She is vulnerable here. The way you choose to handle it could set the tone for the rest of your relationship. \n\nCan you find another place in the house for a treadmill?  Could you look for a used treadmill, to keep costs down?\n\nPlease, try to find a compromise that gives MIL a treadmill somewhere in your home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

WTF? That is rude to ask for such a thing. Not sure if any place rents them but it is YOUR house, not hers.", "A walking pad is a good suggestion & we will try making it but I think she wants a huge normal bulky treadmill.\n\nThe reasons are just that she likes walking for hours and spending her time doing that. She doesn\u2019t have other hobbies, job, doesn\u2019t drive, no friends very close by (has great friends they just live quite a drive away). Another commenter said it\u2019s probably a stress relief measure and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some truth to that too.\n\nOur feelings are that she\u2019s supposed to be looking after her only grandchild for hours a day - why can\u2019t that be enough? For context, MIL won\u2019t be coming for any baby shower before the birth, not coming for the birth, & has never visited in the 5 years her only child has lived in the US. This will be the first time she\u2019s meeting her only grandchild and the first time she\u2019s helping us (vs us always visiting her & spending the time & $ to do so)", "NTA. Fair warning, it sounds like she won\u2019t be there to \u201chelp\u201d but to \u201chlep\u201d. That\u2019s a whole different thing."]}
