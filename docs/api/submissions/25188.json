What an unreasonable request. \n\nNTA. Good luck with having her around, if this is any indication of her behaviour, these next two months are going to feel like a decade lol", "NTA. Treadmill are not cheap and if she'll be the only one using it, I see no valid reason to buy one. \nIf it's so important to her to see exercise she can take your offer for the gym membership or find and alternative routine for 2 months. \nI don't know if it was she who volunteered to help you with your baby, but paying for the gym can also be a way to thank her for the help.\nBe sure to resolve the situation before she come, especially in regards of childcare and her own routine.", "NTA, Why is it her way or no way?  You offered her a gym membership, this is a perfectly reasonable compromise.", "NTA: Dear lord - she's supposed to be coming to help you with the child right? Sounds like she's going to be more work for you and your husband.\n\nTell her absolutely no way will you get a treadmill for her. She can either walk the neighborhood or sit on the couch or *stay home.*", "NTA.\n\nYou are not required to get a treadmill when there are viable alternatives as you suggested - walking outside or short-term gym membership.\n\nMIL is trying to be controlling.  Have your spouse talk with her and enforce the boundary.\n\nAlso, you do not have to travel that often.  They can come to you, even without a treadmill.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house, and treadmills are frankly bulky and ugly", "It might be the kind of equipment you can rent.", "INFO are there any particular reasons she\u2019s so adamant about walking for hours every day? It definitely sounds quite extreme to be running asking that much regularly. Three hours at a regular pace would but her at easily 9 miles a day. \n\nMaybe a walking pad could be an alternative if she\u2019s not running. They can easily slide under a bed when not in use and are significantly cheaper and lighter than a traditional treadmill.", "There\u2019s a hidden issue here: it seems your MIL uses treadmill walking as her way to cope with stress. I say this because so the several hours a day she spends on the treadmill, and her inability to go without it for even a few days. \n\nWhy is this important?  You seem to think this issue is about a piece of workout equipment, when it\u2019s really about how MIL copes with daily life. \n\nIf you don\u2019t make a treadmill available to her, it\u2019s a really big deal to her. She is vulnerable here. The way you choose to handle it could set the tone for the rest of your relationship. \n\nCan you find another place in the house for a treadmill?  Could you look for a used treadmill, to keep costs down?\n\nPlease, try to find a compromise that gives MIL a treadmill somewhere in your home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She has never come to visit us before and instead we have to fly across the world 2-5x a year to see her & FIL. We just bought our dream home and she wants a treadmill in the guest room. We do not. It seems heavy for our old house and we want her to look after our baby not be on the loud treadmill walking for several hours a day. When we visit she will still spend several hours a day walking on the treadmill even though we\u2019ve taken time off work (she does not work) & traveled across the world to see her. House is in a very quiet, peaceful, walkable, safe, sidewalk community - but she does not want to walk outside. Have also offered to get her a gym membership which she was not open to. Is this unreasonable request or are we the aholes?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

WTF? That is rude to ask for such a thing. Not sure if any place rents them but it is YOUR house, not hers.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Fair warning, it sounds like she won\u2019t be there to \u201chelp\u201d but to \u201chlep\u201d. That\u2019s a whole different thing.", "NTA - a treadmill that can be used for many hours a day will be expensI\u2019ve because they need to be durable. The cheaper walking pads, folding treadmills that you can find on Amazon, won\u2019t hold up to many hours of walking every day.  I\u2019ve had both because I am in tech and work from home.\n\nif she is coming to help, she really isn\u2019t going to have time to walk on the treadmill\u2026 it sounds like you are planning to have her help and do childcare.  If she wants to walk, a stroller for the baby is the thing and she can take the baby for walks.\n\nthere seems to be a disconnect between what she thinks she will be doing vs what the actual work you expect her to do is\u2026 perhaps, you and hubby need to identify the list of things you expect her to be doing and how much of the day that will occupy.  You both need to make sure you are on the same page with MIL.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real problem is that you allow your MIL to visit for TWO months - every other problem pales besides that - you are doing this to yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe starts with the entilement before she is even here - when she arrives, it will get worse.", "This is a completely unreasonable & pricey request.  I would tell her no & let her know the reasons why.  She most likely won't understand & get pissed off, but it's your house, your rules.  There's no need to buy her a treadmill just bc she's coming to stay with you.", "NTA.  Your house.  I wouldn't want a big a$$ treadmill in my guest room either.", "She was offered compromises like a gym membership. Op talking about looking in to a walking pad", "It sounds like you all need to be clear on expectations and reevaluate the planned trip based on that.", "I\u2019m curious if the baby will sleep through  the noise. How old will your baby be when MIL arrives?", "NTA. Her presence is supposed to make things easier for the two of you during the adjustment period. It currently sounds like her visit will cost you money, require alterations to your home, and come with multiple demands. She can either come be a part of this experience on your terms in your home or stay with her treadmill and be an uninvolved grandmother. Trust me when I tell you that, oftentimes, being on your own is better than certain kinds of \u201chelp.\u201d", "I'm going to be honest - I do think that you are TA. The language you use to describe what your mother in law is \"supposed\" to do and how you specifically said that taking care of the baby should be enough for her for 2 months. She is there to help, not be a slave for you. If this is what helps her in her everyday life, so be it. Treadmills can be expensive, but 2nd hand is always an option. Walking pads as well. And as someone who exercises - there is a difference between doing it at home and going to a gym \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So she won\u2019t be taking the baby for walks?\n\nDo a Craig\u2019s list search for a used treadmill.  Good chance that getting her one would not meet her expectations anyway.  Or try telling her you won\u2019t be getting one; just no.", "I know a guy.", "NTA it's your home, and while it's right to make guests comfortable, that's excessive.", "I was going to suggest a walking pad too.  She could buy it and they could store it under the bed when she\u2019s not visiting.  It doesn\u2019t sound like the MIL is going to be changing her habits anytime soon, this probably will not be the last time this issue comes up.", "Asking someone you\u2019re visiting to buy a large piece of gym equipment is *insane*. Even if OP had room, why should they spend a large amount of money on something they have no desire to own? Even if MIL offered to pay, OP would still have it in their home, taking up space.  \n\nIf it really is something MIL needs for her mental health/as a coping mechanism, she should have alternatives worked out. She doesn\u2019t want to walk outside? March on the spot indoors. Go to a gym. Explore alternative exercises that she can substitute in temporarily.  \n\nWhat if her own treadmill broke down and she had to wait for repairs or a replacement? Whatever she would do in that situation, she should do while visiting.", "People literally give treadmills away (especially the heavy ones), or sell them for $20."]}
