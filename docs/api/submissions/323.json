It was pretty high. She then starts to scold me and says that she just went to the bathroom real quick and I should have seen this. I said that she never told me that she'd be away.

I'm not into watching kids but if asked to temporarily watch a kid I would probably say yes. But it's almost never asked.

In that situation if a parent needs to go to the bathroom they don't usually ask for someone to watch the kids because the assumption is that everyone is already kind of keeping an eye on the kids. This is probably what's happening when people leave you to watch their kids without asking, especially since it seems like your social group includes a not insignificant amount of parents with kids. If you're having repeated issues with a specific person leaving you to watch their kid it might be worth having a conversation with them about cultural differences or different understandings of social norms.\n\nHowever in this specific case, it sounds like the child wasn't playing with the rest of the kids and was being specifically watched by the mom. In that case she definitely should have told you that she was temporarily leaving the space and that you needed to keep an eye on her kid, especially if you were the only adult there.", "If you don\u2019t know you are expected to keep an eye on the kid, because no one asked for you to or alerted you that they were leaving the room, and you had been preoccupied and didn\u2019t notice, NTA, assuming you really didn\u2019t notice. \n\nBut if you did see you were alone with the child and just didn\u2019t want to be responsible, you would be the asshole if you let the baby get hurt just to make a point.

Why is OP\u2019s responsibility to watch the baby when the father is there?", "My favorite is when they post in some random local fb group asking for a babysitter for the night or the next night. Like you\u2019re just gonna randomly leave your kid with someone you don\u2019t know to go out and meet them that night?!? Hell I barely leave my kids with freaking family! I\u2019m sure as hell not gonna leave them with some rando I met once on FB.", "With hindsight and everything, taking that kid up to the resort staff and saying, \"I don't know this kid or her parents. Her mom apparently told her to build sand castles with me. I didn't and won't agree to provide childcare, please put her in a childcare program until her mom comes back\" (then run away), would have been the way to resolve that.", "That mom wanted that kid to get unalived, bet. There was a TikTok going around about the idea of rich parents taking their kids on risky vacations, with limited supervisions, in awful hopes they won't come back with them, if you catch my drift.", "Or at the very least you say I am just popping to the loo can you keep an eye on them for a few minutes", "Yup I\u2019d let my husband know I was leaving the room so he could run interference on injury or death on our kids when they were little.", "Oh 100% I agree. I make sure my partner in crime knows if I need to tap out for a sec. You are very correct here", "Came here to say this. Me and my husband even tell each other when we are about to leave the room or go outside so the other parent knows they are now the sole person in charge. My kids are both over 6 years old and we still tag team. I don't even take a shower without letting him know so I can have peace of mind the kids are being watched.", "Totally. I don't have kids, so my sense of what's safe/not safe for toddlers isn't always very accurate.", "Don't beat yourself up for it. You're not a parent, you don't have the built in radar parents get when you have a kid.", "If toddler's dad was in the room, she should have handed the baby to him. She could have brought the toddler to the bathroom with her. She could have opened her mouth and asked someone to watch.\n\nThis is NOT your responsibility. NTA", "My daughter was definitely the reason we stopped at  two kids. That kid has been climbing and falling/jumping off shit since before she could walk! It\u2019s a good things she tough\u2026and bounces cuz I\u2019m sure if she wasn\u2019t she\u2019d have had a lot more close calls. As it is my much more careful first child has had more busted noses or lips than she has. The second she was mobile enough to crawl she decided she was mobile enough to get herself stuck in some strange situations\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. She also doesn\u2019t know how to walk at all. If she\u2019s not climbing she\u2019s running. My husband legit had to climb a damn tree yesterday cuz she got herself into the top of the tree but couldn\u2019t get herself out. She\u2019s freaking 4 but feels like she has to keep up with her 7 year old brother \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What did I say?\nI said he was IF. \nThat's for him to acknowledge.\nSince I  sure he won't admit it here if he did allow it to go too far, i simply gave him the opportunity to be honest with himself.", "Uhhh OP said it was just him and her and this toddler in the room and the mom and toddler were behind him. He never mentioned this kid\u2019s dad was in the room? If he was, by all means yeah he should be watching his kid too. I didn\u2019t get that dad was even in the room according to OP\u2019s story. And if mom needed to use the restroom, that\u2019s typically like take baby and go real quick instead of calling baby\u2019s dad to come up or going all the way down the stairs to drop baby with dad. Either way, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem and mom shouldn\u2019t be taking it out in OP.", "Tell me you\u2019re not Gen X without telling me you\u2019re Gen X. You go first.", "There was also a tik tok going around about people making stuff up to fool gullible fools, if you know what I mean", "OP didn\u2019t even realize the toddler was about to fall until the mom screamed. It says that in the post.", "He did, however, mention that all the women there were either girlfriends or wives of his buddies, so the dad *was* there. And the mother should have taken her child out where the dad could watch his own baby while the mother went to the bathroom. It\u2019s almost insulting to the capabilities of fathers everywhere that apparently that is such a wild thought that I have yet to see anybody else mention it, as though it has not even occurred. \n\nThere is a grey area between a mother having to drag her infant to the bathroom with her every time she goes, sacrifice *all* her autonomy and privacy to the extent of not even being able to pee by herself anymore, and a poor unaware stranger having the duties of babysitter thrust upon them unwillingly and being insulted when he couldn\u2019t read her mind to realise that. That grey area is called *fatherhood*. \n\nThe mother should have taken her child out to the dad, or called him to come upstairs\u2014it wouldn\u2019t have killed him so his wife could go in peace, especially since it sounds like she handled the lions share of childcare the rest of the day. It\u2019s not on OP to watch this kid when the mother needs a bathroom break, it\u2019s on the dad. Doesn\u2019t matter where he was.", "born in 1986 so a geriatric millennial that borders on gen x I have a lot more gen x ideas I lean towards than I do millennial shit but not when it comes to my kids and leaving them with random people I don\u2019t know \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This", "No way he didn't notice mom walk out.", "He didn't say the dad was there he said she was a friend of one of the wives", "The couch was in front of the tv and the mom was behind me with her toddler. I was facing away on my phone", "He wasn\u2019t paying attention when he was on his phone and drinking. Just because you would notice something like that doesn\u2019t mean everyone would. I know I wouldn\u2019t notice something like that, especially if I\u2019m on my phone and drinking. Let me guess you\u2019re either the mom or one of the girlfriends who\u2019s defending the mom? People who don\u2019t have kids don\u2019t tend to pay attention to other peoples kids, especially when drinking", "People dont notice others leaving the room all the time. Especially if they are doing something else, like looking at their phone. \n\nYou must be super human to see everything going in in a room while looking at your phone.", "Did you state that in your original post?\nIf you did and I missed it, my apologies."]}
