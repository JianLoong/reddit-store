That is life.\n\nBut life is also following contracts, and she has to stick to her end of the deal on the lease. \n\nThe best solution is to find a new roommate to cover her half. She can also help find someone if she wants to get out of the contract ASAP.", "NTA- She signed the contract, so she is as responsible as you for the payment.", "NTA. You arent being cruel, you are being reasonable for the contract you both signed. Inform her that she can pay or you can take her to sma claims court.", "NTA. Nope, the lease makes the terms of the lease quite clear.", "NTA. But you need to talk to the landlord about this and inform them about what's going on so they will know who to go after for the missing funds.", "NTA, she signed the lease so she's supposed to pay it. Nothing you can really do though", "NTA, and I guarantee she wouldn\u2019t accept it if the shoe were on the other foot.", "NTA. She signed the contract for the lease so should still pay half until the contract runs out / or until you find a roomate", "NTA at all especially because you offered to advertise for a roommate in the meantime. As long as you're making a good faith effort to get someone else in the apartment, it's okay.", "NTA - as someone mentioned, small claims court. Ridiculous, I hate when people do this! I\u2019m sorry you are going through this and she is trash for doing it", "if the landlord has her bank info they should be able to get the money from her more than you will. she signed a year long lease and it is her own fault for trying to back out now. NTA", "One month, maybe two but the only way you\u2019d get money out of her is probably through small claims court. You\u2019re going to have to do something to mitigate your losses, such as getting a roommate or move out. If you move out, your landlord can go after one or both of you to cover their costs.\n\nYou could also play a reverse Uno card and leave before her.", "NTA. She made a legal commitment that she is breaking. She refuses to honor that commitment. Time to lawyer up because you are now responsible for all of the remaining rent , whether in monthly installments because you live there or as a lump sum because you skipped out too.  A lawyer may have better ideas in forcing her to pay her fair share.", "NTA", "NTA - Definitely advise her that she is legally obligated to fulfill her end of that rental agreement.  Should she choose not to, then you will have to file a claim.  This could impact her credit as well as the ability to rent in the future.  Check with your landlord to see what steps you can take in this situation as well and get approval to get a new roommate.  I personally would not be looking for another roommate.  Like you said, she likely knew she was on the verge of breaking up with you before she signed the lease.  You could have rented a more affordable unit or stayed where you were at, and now you are stuck for the next  few months.", "She signed a lease.  It is not an unreasonable expectation to have he pay her share of the rent.\n\nNTA", "Personally no I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re the asshole for this, you and her are both on the lease, you both are expected to make sure bills get paid. Don\u2019t depend on her to do it as women have a long track record of dodging accountability, but she 1000% deserves to pay her half.

Your ex needs a better education. She signed the lease. Unless the landlord allows her to remove herself (unlikely) or someone else takes over her half, she is legally liable for half the rent for the term of the lease. Period. \n\nIf she doesn't believe you, tell her to google it. Or maybe she should tell her parents, \"Hey, I signed a lease for 12 months, but I'm moving out after just two. I don't have to pay anything else, right?\" Cue shocked Pikachu face when google or mom/dad tells her she still has to pay.", "Sue her is small claims court.", "Oh, reverse uno is a good idea. Then you can help *her* find a replacement roommate, about as much as she\u2019d help you.\n\nOne other thought: pretend it\u2019s college, and it\u2019s her responsibility to pay or find someone to sublet her half.

I never heard of a gender bias in contract dispute.", "silly me, you are so right !", "NTA. It has nothing to do with the relationship. And actually her conflict isn't with you, it's with the landlord/rental company. Let them know *immediately* that she has stated her intent to break the lease and that you intend to keep it and continue living there It's three separate parties to the lease.\n\nShe's wrong. She can explain her reasoning to a judge.", "NTA", "NTA,she signed a lease and is responsible for paying her portion.", "NTA. Legally you are both responsible for the rent. You should try to find a roommate to take over for her but in the meantime she is responsible for her half. If she doesn\u2019t pay you will have to cover it and then sue her in small claims court.", "Nta.  She's on the lease, thus responsible for 1/2 the rent.  The relationship status is irrelevant.", "NTA. You're being reasonable, and she is equally responsible.", "Is this a repost?", "NTA\n\nIt isn't \"cruel\" to expect her to live up to her legally binding contractual obligations until you can find someone else and get her off the lease.", "NTA she's crazy if she thinks that's gonna fly.

If she doesn\u2019t pay you, you can take her to court.", "NTA your gf or ex. Is stupid. She has to pay period. She wants to take advantage of you do t let her. We have a saying in Spanish for people like her, \u201cesta bien pendeja\u201d!", "NTA.  It seems she still has the mentality of someone who is used to being supported by others and doesn\u2019t understand how things work in the real world.  Can you break the lease and ask her to pay part of the penalty?  That could be another option so you could move to a cheaper apartment.", "NTA.. how does this princess think the world works?

Let them know what's happening and make sure that they will let someone take over the lease from your ex when you find someone.", "\\^This.\n\nSharing the lease does not mean she can't break up with you. It does mean that she's on the hook to either pay half the rent or find someone to sublet (assuming there are enough bedrooms and you're willing to share an apartment with someone you're not in a relationship with).  \n(Edited for grammar)", "Agreed. If she doesn\u2019t want to pay that rent anymore, then she needs to go to the landlord about breaking her lease if she can. If not, then she better make arrangements.", "In my state, the default with apartment leases, it doesn't matter who is short or not. Each individual on the lease is responsible for the WHOLE lease. The only exception I know of (by default) is university leases. \n\nIn this case, it would still be OPs responsibility, in my state, to pay the whole lease then OP would have to go after the ex for half the missing rent. \n\nSo in my state, The landlord doesn't need to get half from each. Just the landlord needs 100% the rent amount from any source or an eviction occurs for all on the lease.\n\nEdit: but each apartment can have different rules, so definitely check the lease. Usually the apartment has a duty to mitigate though. Especially in the case of a broken lease", "Exactly. A lease is a LEGALLY binding agreement. You cannot wake up one day and say \u2018since I do not live here anymore I do not have to pay\u2019 lol. Yea\u2026nope. \n\nOP: You need to be upfront with your landlord and let him know what\u2019s going on. You can provide him with your STBX\u2019s contact information and the address where she is moving. He may choose to send her a legal demand letter. He may also not allow roommates who are not on the lease. He may want to run a potential new roommates credit and draw up a new lease.", "Small claims court is a good idea. Better yet, Judge Judy and trips to LA all around."]}
