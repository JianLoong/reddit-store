In the middle of nowhere as they wanted somewhere in the countryside for their dog, which meant no possibility of a housemate.\n\nHe ended up not being able to afford to eat for a while, and was left paying off the credit card debt he'd had to take on to meet the extra rent and utility payments til he could move somewhere cheaper.\n\nI think he was more nice about it than i would have been, and like 'well I couldn't expect her to pay for a place she wasn't living in' when it was her decision to wait til they signed the lease to split.
