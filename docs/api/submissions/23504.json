That is life.\n\nBut life is also following contracts, and she has to stick to her end of the deal on the lease. \n\nThe best solution is to find a new roommate to cover her half. She can also help find someone if she wants to get out of the contract ASAP.", "NTA- She signed the contract, so she is as responsible as you for the payment.", "NTA. You arent being cruel, you are being reasonable for the contract you both signed. Inform her that she can pay or you can take her to sma claims court.", "NTA. Nope, the lease makes the terms of the lease quite clear.", "NTA. But you need to talk to the landlord about this and inform them about what's going on so they will know who to go after for the missing funds.", "NTA, she signed the lease so she's supposed to pay it. Nothing you can really do though", "NTA, and I guarantee she wouldn\u2019t accept it if the shoe were on the other foot.", "NTA. She signed the contract for the lease so should still pay half until the contract runs out / or until you find a roomate", "NTA at all especially because you offered to advertise for a roommate in the meantime. As long as you're making a good faith effort to get someone else in the apartment, it's okay.", "NTA - as someone mentioned, small claims court. Ridiculous, I hate when people do this! I\u2019m sorry you are going through this and she is trash for doing it", "if the landlord has her bank info they should be able to get the money from her more than you will. she signed a year long lease and it is her own fault for trying to back out now. NTA", "One month, maybe two but the only way you\u2019d get money out of her is probably through small claims court. You\u2019re going to have to do something to mitigate your losses, such as getting a roommate or move out. If you move out, your landlord can go after one or both of you to cover their costs.\n\nYou could also play a reverse Uno card and leave before her.", "NTA. She made a legal commitment that she is breaking. She refuses to honor that commitment. Time to lawyer up because you are now responsible for all of the remaining rent , whether in monthly installments because you live there or as a lump sum because you skipped out too.  A lawyer may have better ideas in forcing her to pay her fair share.", "NTA", "NTA - Definitely advise her that she is legally obligated to fulfill her end of that rental agreement.  Should she choose not to, then you will have to file a claim.  This could impact her credit as well as the ability to rent in the future.  Check with your landlord to see what steps you can take in this situation as well and get approval to get a new roommate.  I personally would not be looking for another roommate.  Like you said, she likely knew she was on the verge of breaking up with you before she signed the lease.  You could have rented a more affordable unit or stayed where you were at, and now you are stuck for the next  few months.", "She signed a lease.  It is not an unreasonable expectation to have he pay her share of the rent.\n\nNTA", "Personally no I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re the asshole for this, you and her are both on the lease, you both are expected to make sure bills get paid. Don\u2019t depend on her to do it as women have a long track record of dodging accountability, but she 1000% deserves to pay her half. Sorry this happened to you my man.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
