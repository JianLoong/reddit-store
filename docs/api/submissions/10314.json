Esp given you have a female child.\n\nAnyhow you're going to do what you're going to do but I'm just pointing out these are pretty well equally risky for a tourist.", "Plus, have they gone recently?! Even before it was dangerous, but now the Iranian GOVERNMENT is shooting people in the streets. Even children", "You haven't been to India have you.\nWhat the government does or allows there is .... Anyhow nevermind. You're obviously not well-versed on India, or Iran.", "This is what came to my mind. I wouldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t care how much of an asshole it made me to refuse to go or allow our child to go.", "I thought you said it was different.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/06/indiana-assembly-passes-anti-abortion-bill-sends-it-to-governor", "So is Yankeestan, and?", "I was born in India and grew up there, and speak Tamil.", "You\u2019re an idiot. She knows the pros and cons of the country she was born in better than you do. You think India is a monolith that only embodies whatever overly simplified stereotypes you have in your ignorant mind? Fking racist", "Also, while India is far from perfect, they are a democracy and have a functioning judiciary, while Iran is a oppressive theocratic dictatorship.  No one is safe in Iran.", "He is not religious as in he says he does not believe in God, but does not mind the culture.", "Canada has a terrorism advisory for the UK and France as well. The travel advisory mentions risk for India but for Iran it is literally do not visit that does not make it equally risky.\n\nIt is not equally risky, I am not a tourist in India, I was born there, could get an Indian passport if I revoked my French and British ones, have a visa called Overseas Citizen of India. My husband is a tourist there yes but he is also not a woman and if he did not want to go I would understand. I can go out without a headscarf in India.", "They are by no means equally risky", "Lmao the funny thing is I have! If you are comparing Iran to India then clearly you know nothing of the two.", "You think the OP is at risk of losing custody of her children while on vacation in the US?", "Like the culture where he has all the power.  Once there he can divorce you and take your daughter.", "Have you seen the movie Not Without my Daughter?? Do not take this trip.", "He does not mind the culture that oppresses, rapes, tortures, mutilates and kills women for existing? He does not mind the culture where women are below livestock? He does not mind the culture that marries literal children to grown ass men?\n\nHe sounds like a peach.", "Nah, I was just reflecting the \"Iran IS a problem as a country\", which can also be said for a country that invades others for no or under false cause (Syria, Lybia, occupies Kosovo and Metohia, is about to invade Haiti), commits TERRORIST ACTS, like the world just found out thanks to Sy Hercsh regarding German/Swiss/Russian Nordstream 2 projects, support for Neo-nazies, ban on abortions in the US, student loans, medical debt, etc, etc...", "This isn\u2019t exclusive to Iran. The US practices all of this as well, as do many other countries.", "The US is about to invade Haiti?", "This is called \u201cwhat-aboutism\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m also worried about the fact that the US seems to be slipping into some bullshit as a woman living here but it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to ignore the issue everywhere bc the US is going through some shit.", "This is a very disingenuous comment based on the current events in Iran.", "Nearly 300,000 children as young as 10 were married in the U.S. between 2000 and 2018 \u2013 mostly girls wed to adult men. Women\u2019s rights are at risk and crumbling in the US as we speak. Look at how rape victims are treated and how their aggressors are given a slap on the wrist. We excuse the behavior when it comes from the US, but show such anger when it happens in a country we agree to hate. That\u2019s unacceptable.", "The current events in Iran are the PEOPLE (aka those that create the culture, that has existed for thousands of years), secular and Muslim alike, revolting against an oppressive regime that has been in place for less than 50. Yes, the government should be feared, but the culture of Iran and Iranians is overwhelmingly known for its hospitality and desire for freedom.", "I\u2019m female, and Iranian. It\u2019s not disingenuous. I\u2019m simply pointing out that people are quick to point fingers and show disgust towards other when the same thing is happening in their own backyard.", "Child marriage should 100% be outlawed in the US. But it\u2019s disingenuous to make a comparison to Iran.\n\nAlso according to the recent article in the Economist, 2/3 were 17. Which again is terrible for a Western country. But not the same as a country where women are hauled off the street for improper headscarf usage and murdered like Masha Amini was.", "Yes, comparing Iran to the US in regards to women\u2019s rights is disingenuous.\n\nWomen in Iran must wear a hijab, cannot casually date or have premarital sex, need permission from their husband to leave the country, etc.\n\nThe US is taking a giant step back regarding women\u2019s rights compared to other Western countries, but\u2026.come on.  Seriously comparing it to Iran?  Not in the same ballpark."]}
