Of those for whom age, gender, and spousal information was available, 78% were girls (under 18 years of age) wed to adult men (aged 18 years or older).

Sure there are options still available, but you have a lot of people working hard to take those options away. You're ragging on Iran for being an oppressive, theocratic state (rightfully so), and I'm saying out loud that The United States is well on its way down that very path.

One of my best friends dated a Persian man and he was born and brought up in England. But the controlling, obsessive behaviour that can be culturally specific came out anyway. DO NOT DO THIS. He might just be ignorant and romanticise Iran, but his stupidity is not a reason for you to lose your child and yourself. That he is pushing it and worse, comparing Iran to India, is really unsettling to me. \n\nThere is zero comparison between Tamil Nadu or South India and Iran. People here commented on how India is also misogynistic and that\u2019s true but the south has the highest level of womens education and the lowest level of female infanticide. Women can walk on the street at night without fear in cities. Its extremely different and that he doesn\u2019t see this and is pushing it makes me really afraid. \n\nI also had an Iranian friend who studied in the UK. When her parents found out she was dating an Englishmen, they stopped her studies, forced her back home and forcibly married her to a man who beat her and raped her. There was absolutely nothing we could do from England. We tried to get the uni to talk to the embassy. We just had no power at all. She killed herself. \n\nWe were 19. \n\nDO NOT DO THIS. Divorce him if he pushes it. These men are all lovely in the West but once they are back where they have unlimited power, that cultural misogyny and hatred of women takes over.
