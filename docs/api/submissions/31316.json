For most of our childhoods it was just mom, my brother (13m) and me (16m). Our dad died when we were little and I remember and miss him but I did eventually adjust to it being the three of us. Part of me found a way to like the way things were even though most of the time I longed for dad to suddenly be alive. My brother doesn't remember him but he did form a connection through mom's stories of dad and all the home movies we have.\n\nThen mom married Dave and Dave's two kids \"Ella (8f) and Michael (7m)\" moved in with us. My brother struggled the most with it. He had quite a few freak-outs in the first 18 months and one time mom sent Ella to watch a movie with us and my brother started yelling and asking why the hell someone was intruding in our sibling time. Mom freaked out about that because she really didn't like that my brother was so upset about Ella and Michael being included. Whenever Dave would try to parent us he'd also get very upset and start getting loud in the way he does when he gets upset. It's not loud in the typical sense but his whole voice changes.\n\nMy brother also has facial tics and he has a lot of them when mom is trying to promote family bonding. So if we all go to a movie or if we're forced to do some kind of family picnic or something, my brother will struggle to control his face because of how much it bothers him (certain emotions trigger his facial tics worse).\n\nA couple of weeks ago mom was telling us that we needed to start including Ella in our Minecraft time because she plays the game and she has expressed an interest in being included. My brother had a physical reaction to that and mom asked him why he was so bothered by it. He struggled to get the words out because his voice changed again. But he eventually told her that he preferred life before she remarried and then he went up to our bedroom. Mom looked exhausted and she was talking to herself and I think she was finding it hard to keep it together. She asked me why I hadn't been able to talk him around. I told her it's because I agree with him and I preferred it before. She got really upset and stormed out of the house for a while. Dave was home so his kids weren't just alone with us.\n\nBut the next day mom told me I had piled on her for no damn reason and I don't have being autistic as an excuse to hate that she remarried. She told me I should be helping my brother come around to our \"new siblings\" and that I should know how scary his behavior can be for them and if they knew I hated having them around it would really upset them. Ever since that point she's made comments about how disappointed she is in me. I get more comments then when my brother says something to her, because she asks or approaches him. I can feel how angry she is.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700420454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17z4604/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_brother_that_i/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked and you gave an honest answer. It just wasn't the answer she wanted.\n\nThe thing is, this is not something that one can be \"talked around\" to preferring.\n\nThe other thing is, just because you preferred what you had before doesn't necessarily mean you actually object to things now or begrudge your mother's happiness. I don't think your mother gets this.", "NTA.  You are not your brother\u2019s keeper. He is her responsibility, not yours. It sounds like she is trying to make you act as a parent towards your brother and step-siblings and that is definitely not your job.  At your age, You are not equipped to parent younger children, especially those with special needs.  I am not saying you should not be polite to them and engage with them.  They are your siblings though, not your kids.\n\nYour mom and step dad should have sought help before trying to blend two families.  Couples therapy or family therapy for starters.  There are tools they could have used to make the transition easier.  But it was never your job to make everyone get along.  That is only your mom and step-dad\u2019s job.  They need help - but you aren\u2019t it.\n\nI hope your brother is at least getting help through school or counseling. He is not adjusting and probably cannot adjust to this new family without lots of help. Again- not your job.\n\nThere is also nothing wrong with expressing your honest opinion about how you feel to your mom, whether it is the response she wants or not.  What you are old enough to do though, is start thinking about what would need to happen for you to feel better about your new family. What do you think would make your family arrangement less stressful? What could your mom and step-dad do to make you change your mind about preferring your life before she got remarried? Can you talk to them about your thoughts?", "NTA\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the way you feel.  Your brother has been honest with her; good for you for backing him up.\n\nYour mom shouldn't expect you to entertain children almost half your ages.  That smacks of babysitting to me.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA\n\nShe can\u2019t force you or your brother to be friends with them just because it\u2019s convenient for her.\n\nYou never got a choice in the matter.", "It sounds like you need to take a nice long walk with your mom and have a heart to heart. Tell her that while you understand she is married and you get that it might be good for her and even for you in the long run, forcing things will not work. \n\nLet her know that you and your brother might never see Dave's kids as siblings you could eventually, over time develop a relationship with them. But having it forced upon you will only make things bad.", "NTA. She can't force you to suddenly bone nor should her husband think he can suddenly parent you. Time to discuss some boundaries with your mom.", "NTA. It's completely understandable for your brother to struggle with the changes that came with your mom's remarriage. Adjusting to a new blended family can be challenging, especially for someone who has lost a parent. It's important for your mom to try to understand and support your brother's feelings instead of dismissing them. It's okay for you to have your own preferences as well. Open communication and empathy would be key in resolving this situation.", "NTA.  She choose to marry and get step children you and your brother get dragged along by her choices\n\nShe needs to stop forcing a relationship for the family bond \n\nHope you and your brother continue to support each other", "NTA. Your mom should have a life as well, but forcing a certain lifestyle which you guys don\u2019t like isn\u2019t going to help anyone. Blended families don\u2019t always work out, and people in them may not always like each other. Her forcing family time when it makes your brother tic isn\u2019t helpful or nice.", "NTA. It's completely understandable that you and your brother would feel this way given the circumstances. It's important for your mom to acknowledge and validate your feelings instead of dismissing them. It might be helpful for your family to seek therapy or counseling to address these issues and find a way to navigate this new chapter in your lives.", "NAH. It's ok to feel like you do, it's ok that your brother feels the way he does. It's ok that your Mom remarried. It's ok that combining households/families is not easy. This is fairly normal life struggles. Where your Mom is a slight AH is trying to force bonding time. You can't force it, it has to come naturally or it may never happen.", "NTA, I can understand why you and your brother feel this way. It's a big adjustment to suddenly have new siblings and a stepfather in your life. It's important for your mom to listen to your feelings and concerns instead of dismissing them. Your emotions are valid and deserve to be acknowledged.", "NTA. It's completely understandable that you and your brother are struggling with the changes that came with your mom's remarriage. Adjusting to a new family dynamic can be challenging, especially when there's a loss involved. It's important for your mom to have open and understanding conversations with both of you about your feelings and concerns.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom is the AH, and this will not end well.", "YWNBTA. Your mother is having difficulty with the fact that you guys don\u2019t like the new situation and never did. She reacted badly to the the truth and that\u2019s unfair to you and your brother.\nThis isn\u2019t just adjusting to Dave - it\u2019s 3 new people and your lives changing drastically. \n\nYou should talk to your mother and tell her that you and your brother are not doing well and need help navigating this situation. If you both can\u2019t say- try writing it. I hope you both get therapy and support and that your mother listens to you.", "NTA for feeling the way you do. But that's being too hard on your mom. Most people don't want to be alone. You haven't said the new in-laws are doing anything bad or mean. \n\nYeah. Definitely have every right to feel the way you do. I'd just take is easier on my mom. Don't want her to be unhappy.", "NAH. it's hard when a parent remarries on everyone. You have a right to feel that way I'm sure she misses your dad as much as you do. \n\nI'm sure she was lonely and Dave made her feel good. She's probably tired of having the constant divide in her house. You both don't sound like you made it easy on her.", "NTA \n\nHonestly, if I were you I would tell her how disappointed I\u2019m disappointed in her.

I am confused about something...did she ask either of you about how you felt *before* she got married? If she did and you both were honest about it, then she's the AH for continuing with the marriage right then instead of postponing it.\n\nBlending families can be difficult, it can also be extremely easy, it just depends on how the parents brought everyone together.

You just agreed with your brother that you understand his feelings and that you also liked it better when it was just the three of you.\n\nI think she's forcing you to be close too much. She should back off a little and let it happen on it's own. Also there's a bit of an age difference between you and your step-siblings.

It sounds like your Mom is really stressed and is, unfortunately, looking to you for support. But I really want to emphasize that this isn\u2019t your problem to fix. Both your brother and you are struggling to adjust and your brother\u2019s autism makes it even more difficult. None of this is something that can just be quickly \u2018fixed\u2019. You need help to develop coping strategies and someone to talk to things out with. Maybe write your feeling out so they are clear in your head and ask your mom if you can go out for a coffee or a walk to talk things through.

I also (like your brother) have autism and i did not get along with my mom's now ex bf. I treated him badly. I was abusive and i admit that but i was afraid i was gonna lose my mother. I wanted her to put me first and her now ex boyfriend is just the opposite of me. He is loud and i like peace and quiet so we did not get along", "NTA your mother is being immature and selfish. It would be great to learn at your age not succumb to coercive emotional abuse like your mom is exhibiting", "If your mother wants you to bond with your step siblings, there should be outings organized outside of the house so it doesn\u2019t violate the space you and your brother need. The two of you have been through a lot. I would show her this thread. Perhaps see if she would go to a few therapy appointments with you and your brother so you guys could come up with a plan and be on the same page.

I just don't feel the same about it all that she does.", "I know she is and I don't think she shouldn't have it.", "Do u have a comprehension problem?", "You should say how disappointed your dad would be in her and how disappointed you and your brother are in her for not supporting you and your brother better at this time. Just because she loves Dave does not mean you will just magically become a family. It was you, your brother and her, for so long, that the adaptation will take a long time. Her reaction to you telling her how you quite understandably feel just shows how selfish and thoughtless of her own children she is being.", "Info: is there a counselor at your school?", "That's understandable your still a kid. I hope that you both are in therapy to work thru the trauma you've all experienced", "I never had therapy but my brother has always gone for help navigating through life with autism.", "Well that's bad on your mother. Yes your brother needs special therapy for his autism. \n\nBut you all went thru a traumatic event and counseling is sometimes the best way to get those feelings out and not have issues later on."]}
