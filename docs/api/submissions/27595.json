She was recently divorced, so she said she would prefer not to have the masters bedroom, and said it was between me and my sister on who gets the biggest room. I told my younger sister that she could have it, I wouldn\u2019t mind getting a smaller room.\n\n Jump to 2022 my younger sister said she wanted to move out, I had told her multiple times that she should just stay with us and keep her money (2200 for a room). She went on and got an apartment with 3 of her sorority sisters back from college (6000 total). \n\nWhen she left, I naturally moved into the big room. I told her, and she seemed \u201cokay\u201d with it. But she gave me a \u201cstipulation\u201d that I was not allowed to touch her stuff, and for the most part she still has many clothes and items here, it is more or less a storage unit.\n\nShe had been living with them for about 3 months when she decided to visit us, when she saw me sleeping in the bed, she told me to get out of \u201cher\u201d room. She told me she wants to stay in the room for the rest of the day, as she feels exhausted being in her new apartment and that she doesn\u2019t get privacy (she does have her own room in the apartment, but she tells me she feels like she needs to keep her room open, as it is rude to not make conversations and greet the other girls, so she feels like she is always conversing and it makes her tired)\n\nI remember rolling over and telling her she can sleep beside me, but that I didn\u2019t want to move. \n\nThis led to a huge argument. She said she feels that she has no place to call home now, and all she was asking was for me to get out of \u201c her room \u201c for a couple of hours where she can \u201cde stress\u201d alone. I told her she can stay in the room with me, but that it is now \u201cmy room.\u201d She insisted I still leave.  And that she would do this a couple times a month, and that I could have the room back when she is finished. She insisted I was being unreasonable as I could have the room all the other times she is not here and she is at her apartment. \n\nUsually I\u2019m very kind to my younger sister but this type of \u201cargument\u201d really annoyed me. I explained that she willingly left this house, that I explained to her multiple times to stay to save money, that she had a \u201chome\u201d but that she decided to leave. When she left she left ownership of this room, and that if I wanted to stay in my room, she would be allowed to come and stay as much as she wants. But her telling me to leave and wait, and decide for me on a dime when I can and cannot go in the room, was a big hell no for me. \n\nWe haven\u2019t talked much since, it\u2019s been a year and other then small talk, we haven\u2019t really spoken.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695639377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rosjr/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_this_isnt_her/", "score": 577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She told me that when she goes home to the apartment she does have her own room, but that she feels oblige to have to make a conversation and keep her door open. \n\nI told her she doesn\u2019t need to do that: that she pays a lot for rent and she is allowed to act and feel the way she wants to.\n\nOn my side of the coin, she has to understand she cannot literally go in and out of this room, and throw me out whenever she feels like. She cannot mark this room as her own, when she doesn\u2019t live here anymore! She left willing, no one forced her. I\u2019m a human being.
