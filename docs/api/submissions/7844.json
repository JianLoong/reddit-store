But your past history with this woman is absolutely relevant. In your situation, since she is obviously not interested in what's best for all the children, but seems to be very selfishly focused on her own wants, I would be limiting my daughter's exposure to her as much as I could. Please consider adding your comment about how she acted during an emergency as an edit to your original post. \n\nMy grandparents were divorced, and she hated him passionately. But for events that were for me, my sibling, and cousin, they would both show up and just stay on opposite sides of wherever we were, because it was about the kids, not them. \n\nMy ex and his wife were the same.

But is your concern about drama based on her past behavior during family events, or just that you don't like each other. If the former, then I'll revise my judgement. Her \"harassing\" you about it was certainly not appropriate. \n\n~~But this is now the precedent that you've set.

If you don't want her to attend a party, then don't make it a family party and especially don't let your ex pay for it! \n\nYou need to put your ego aside and think of your child. Blocking this woman and her kids from attending the party was a selfish decision to make only yourself more comfortable.

I get why you don\u2019t want her there. But I think ultimately YTA when it comes to making him pay and then now allowing him to go. Next time pay for it yourself,  and do your own party and he does his own. Sounds like since you all can\u2019t act civil it\u2019s best to do everything separately. Unfortunate that it comes to this as it\u2019s best for the child to see their parents getting along.", "NTA", " Yta only because you didn't tell him GF was not invited before he paid for the party.", "NTA. Boundaries are perfectly acceptable!", "INFO: How long has he been with the GF? Also do your kids regularly throw things in her kids faces? Do your kids even like her kids?", "YTA. Either you choose to tolerate each other for the sake of the children and throw the party together/let hubby/gf/kids come OR you celebrate on your own with two separate parties.   There really isn\u2019t much room for middle ground. It\u2019s weird to exclude his gf so you can try to play happy family with your ex.", "YTA. Grow up.", "The answer to your question is, no. When parents break up or get divorced, typically they don't celebrate birthdays and holidays together. If they have an amicable relationship, they sure can. But saying the kid(s) should get a say on the ex/ex's new family being included isn't reasonable.", "In a comment Op said that the child didn't care that their steps weren't there. Says a lot about that gf and children", "In times like that, ask your ex who\u2019s more important to him, his children or his girlfriend? Make him choose because obviously he keeps forgetting. Does he even know how to stand up for himself? NTA", "NTA I read comments and the GF sucks", ">She planned it all, he paid. \n\n\nYeah, so they should each get to invite people, because it\u2019s a joint party.", "Sure, they can invite people that won\u2019t ruin the party. Read her comments. The girlfriend actively encourages him to be less involved with his own children and didn\u2019t want him to help in an emergency. It also sounds like he was cheating, and that\u2019s why they broke up. She doesn\u2019t need to be there.", "Where do you get that she \"purposefully withheld from her ex that his gf and her kids weren't invited until after he paid for everything\"?"]}
