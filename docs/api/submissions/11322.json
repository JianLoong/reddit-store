But her dad has the same name as her ex, who I know and who I hate. The *most* I'm willing to compromise on is her putting the name in the middle, but I *refuse* to have it as my son's first name.\n\nBut everybody is making it seem like I'm insane for saying that. Even my own mom. *Nobody* is supporting me on this except for my older sister and her husband. Everybody else just shrugs and goes, \"She's the one pushing out the baby, soooo she kinda has the right...\" Or, \"If she names the baby after her ex, just call the baby by a nickname, it's not that serious.\"\n\nBut to me, if it's not that serious, then let's just pick one of the billions of other names out there. Our baby is due next month and I told my wife last night, \"Honey, I'm dead serious. We need to talk about this name. If you name our child after your ex, you're telling me how little you respect me.\"\n\nShe burst in tears, and said, \"Why do you keep trying to guilt trip me? Can't you understand? I'm not naming him after my ex, it's after my father! Stop bringing this up. All this stress is not good for the baby\" and then she called her mom to come pick her up. \n\nOf course her mom called *my* mom and I'm the bad guy again. My wife said she's not coming home unless I promise not to bring this up again. Usually I would let this go as I've been doing, but with the baby due next month, I need to know if I'm being an AH for this. This is a honestly a hill I'm willing to die on. If she gives our child that name I honestly don't see me staying with her. I'll be there for the child, of course, but not with her. That's just extremely disrespectful to me. But the nonchalant way everyone is treating this is making me wonder if I'm taking this too serious.\n\n**EDIT**: I wanted to clarify. I'm not against her using her father's name *completely*. She just wants to use her father's name as our son's *first* name and I don't understand why it would be *less* honoring to her father if we used his name as our child's middle name instead?\n\n**EDIT 2**: I'm going to be trying to get to as many comments as I can throughout the day but I just wanted to say how much the NTA comments mean to me. I feel like for these past few months that I've been trapped in this echo chamber of everyone telling me I'm an AH for wanting a different name for my son and where everyone is just treating me like some random sperm donor that has shouldn't have any so at all. So if I don't get to you all personally, I just wanted to say thank you and let you know how much I appreciate you guys.", "created_utc": 1677787514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gcfxs/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_dont_want_her_to/", "score": 1215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, middle name is a totally reasonable compromise. \n\nBut the way you are talking about it, particularly how hard you are going at your wife about it? That's where you lose me. First of all -- if I was trying to have this conversation with a partner who would not stop using the phrase \"named after the ex\" when I want to name the child after the father, I'd feel like my partner did not fully understand my feelings. You are focusing on something to the point of your own detriment, because she isn't thinking about her ex and as long as you keep framing it that way, she's probably going to feel like you aren't listening to her. \n\nAlso, you are kinda prioritizing how much you hate the ex over how much she loves her father and I don't see how you will ever get anywhere with that. Plus, the topic becomes you not wanting to honour her father because you have this seething hatred for this other guy and it's just turning it into another conversation. \n\nIf you can't get past the deal with the name, then you can't.

We just needed the gender so we could choose a middle name.\nMy partner wants to honour his grandfather, asks if we can use the name Jack.\nJack with the first name we chose and my partners last name is really nice. \nThe issue? My sons father (my ex, not my current partner), his name is Jack. I don\u2019t like him much, there\u2019s a lot of negativity there, mostly surrounding my son. \nMy partner doesn\u2019t care - Jack to him is his grandfather, not my ex.

I think YTA for approaching it so aggressively. Maybe find someone to talk this out with. Address why you hate this guy so much that it can impact your relationship with your wife like this.

I understand her desire to name her child after her recently diseased father. My son was born while my dad was progressing through a terminal disease and while he was alive when he was born, he has since passed. I gave my son the same middle name as him. My families tradition is to pass on middle names. \n\nYou are allowed to not like or want that name for your son. But where you are being a complete AH is your argument why.

Look, yes, you have a right to have a say in the name - and yes, both you and your wife should get to veto names you don't like - but the plain fact is that you are willfully mischaracterising what your wife wants, and that's the part that makes you an asshole. \n\nShe isn't trying to honour her ex, and because of that it shouldn't matter how much you hate him. She wants to honour her father, and you should be deciding based on that, and that alone, not on how you feel about a completely different man who isn't in either of your lives. Is your hatred for him really bigger than your love for your wife? \n\nAnd beyond the name itself, the way you are treating your wife right now is not OK. You are treating her like she's cheating on you, when she's pregnant and grieving her father.

As much as you say it's \"disrespectful\" to you, you don't seem to have enough respect for her to believe her when she says it doesn't have anything to do with the other guy. \n\nIf you just said you'd rather he had a different first name and quit attacking her over something she isnt doing, I don't really think you'd be the AH here at all.", "YTA.

They both deserve better.\n\nAnd just like this is a hill that you\u2019re prepared to die on, I suspect it\u2019s the same for her. She wants to honor her father.

Like yeah, I do think names are a \u201c2 yes, 1 no\u201d scenario, but making her meaningful name choice about *his respect* and not *her bereavement* is a profoundly shitty angle to take.\n\nTo be honest I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s some very basic normal name like \u201cSteve\u201d or \u201cJames\u201d and so he can\u2019t really object on more standard aesthetic grounds, ie the usual \u201cwacky name\u201d posts we see on this sub.\n\n(though I am not gonna forget the teenager boy who insisted that his unborn niece\u2019s baby name was going to get the kid teased because it was so weird and it turned out to be \u201cDeborah\u201d, that\u2019s a cautionary tale right there.)\n\nNoting as well that, in theory, he doesn\u2019t need to give a reason; but in reality, if the other parent really loves a name, they *are* going to want to know why it\u2019s not acceptable, and that\u2019s fair. Sometimes people get attached to these things in a very deep way, and they want a good reason to let go (or to argue about).\n\nThe dude is *so* focused on this disrespect issue and has not remotely addressed the bereavement of his *grieving, pregnant wife*, and I do kind of think that he\u2019s chosen a really selfish hill to die on.", "She\u2019s clearly not naming the baby after her ex, but is *is* disrespectful that she plans on giving her son a name that she knows her husband absolutely hates. It\u2019s disrespectful because she\u2019s locking him out of the conversation regarding something as important as their son\u2019s name.", "I don\u2019t think he sounds insecure I think he just has a negative association with the name. It doesn\u2019t have to be about jealousy. I hated this girl named Amanda growing up and if I had ever had a girl there is no way her name would resemble that. Because I still hate Amanda.", "Exactly! How can you have a kid with a name you absolutely hate ? It\u2019s his kid too and this ain\u2019t fair", "It does eliminate the fallout of calling out a previous partner\u2019s name in bed\u2026", "Sounds like ops wife is literally still grieving her dad and this is probably something in her mind she has to do; add the pregnancy hormones on top of that. I\u2019d be pissed if my partner kept saying it\u2019s after the ex with it\u2019s her dad like her DAD come on. Did she cheat on you with this guy I just don\u2019t get the hang up over this ex. Also I don\u2019t like that op titled the post that way it\u2019s misleading. They should see a therapist to work in better communication. But op YTA", "My mom was named after her dad's dead ex-girlfriend. So she goes by a girl version of her last name Toni. I wanted to name my future daughter Antoinette with Toni being a good nickname for her. Then I met and worked with an Antoinette who I HATED and can barely stand hearing the name these days. Would be an immediate veto if my boyfriend liked that name.", "Yeah, when you name a baby you realize how many people you know who ruin the name for you.", "Damn Amanda.", "I agree. I vetoed several names my husband liked and vice versa because we had bad associations with them. OP's being a bit of an AH in his \"she's disrespecting me\" talk... and perhaps for not taking his wife's grief seriously. She's being an AH for not acknowledging that he has a strong, negative association with the name. She doesn't get to automatically get her way, and, pulling the \"stress is bad for the baby\" card is, frankly, manipulative because it ends conversation/ his attempts at compromise. After all, agreeing to using her father's name as a middle name would also eliminate stress. Would she prefer a shouting match at the hospital right after she's given birth? Will stress be less if he decides to leave her (and his leaving her feels WAY extreme)? This is an ESH to me, and they both need to learn how to communicate and compromise.", "It doesn\u2019t even matter that it\u2019s her dads name. Baby names are ALWAYS 2 yesses 1 no. If he\u2019s going to be incredibly hurt and uncomfortable with his kids name for the rest of his life that is not fair. Pregnancy hormones might explain a situation but doesn\u2019t give her any more right when it comes to the baby just because she has them. She\u2019s disrespecting him and if she was so he\u2019ll bent on it I would leave her too", "Exactly. When my wife and I were picking our childs name, before we knew the gender, a lot of names were ruled out just because one of us knew a person with that name that they hated, or picked on them in high school, or was an ex's name, or a cousins name, or whatever the mundane reasons were, but our reasons were our reasons and we compromised."]}
