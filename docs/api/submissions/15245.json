When did your brother die - recently or some time (years) ago?\n\nLet me start by saying, your Mom is not only a bad mother to you and your brother, but also a bridezilla and probably a narcisist.\n\nUsually, when a bride expects her bridesmaids to wear an expensive dress, she pays for the dresses herself or at least chips in. Furthermore, if you are invited to a wedding, it is the social etiquette / the norm to bring a present, but it is **not** a requirement. Demanding a present, especially a present in that price range, is hybris. Acting like that during one's second wedding makes it increasingly tacky.\n\nBut considering you are her (= momzilla/ bridezilla) **underage daughter,** probably still going to school and therefore not earning any 'reasonable' salary, makes it just **extremely wrong** on so many levels.\n\nSHE has a duty as your mother to care for you - monetarily, physically, emotionally, etc. - and not the other way around. To me, it sounds like she abandoned you (and your angel brother) and just tries to \"milk\" you for money or to show to others, what a great Mom she is because you still support her by being a bridesmaid. \n\nOP, please, stop investing any time, money, feelings and emotions towards your Mom. She proved that the only person she *actually* cares for is herself. Her involvement in your life is just toxic. Even though it is hard, you have to do what is best for you. And this is (at this moment) to break contact with her. Take time to grief, heal and get your life back on track. \n\nI send you lots of strength and love to Sweden (?) and hope you are going to do better soon", "NTA. You do not ever have to go to a wedding you don't want to. Also I'm sorry to hear that she doesn't care, and I'm sorry for your loss.", "I have no words for this \"mother\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA  \nYou mom is an obnoxious old bat.  \nShe doesn't get to demand and decide what you wear and what you gift her.  \nBest to stay away from such a toxic person.", "NTA.", "Posts like these prove that the mother is not always the most suitable parent.

All about her.\n\nYour priorities are excellent.", "It makes you sick?  Nothing about your story makes sense.  \n\nYou created an account TODAY, with the bio of '*Hey, I'm Valerie, 15 years old :) I had to make a new account for my other one stopped working*'\n\nThen your first comment is on someone else's AITA post.  \n\nThen comes your post, of consistently confusing details that make no sense.\n\nBrother Died 14 days ago.\n\nYou received $30,000 (from who?  for what?)\n\nMother doesn't care about a tragically killed son.\n\nDrunk driver responsible for the death, free on all charges.\n\nIt makes you sick?  No. **You are sick.**", "I believe you would make this up before I believe a Mother doesn't care about her tragically killed Son.\n\nAlso Ms. Sweden - Survivor's Pension does not apply to SIBLINGS.\n\nAnd for the record.  Yes I did lose a Brother.  Very tragically.  His drunk driving friend was driving him home and he crashed and killed him.  Unfortunately he walked away scott-free but luckily I got paid $30,000 2 weeks later so I was able to help my dad buy his casket.  Also my mom cheated on my dad and had a wedding 3 days after my brothers wedding and didn't even show up to the funeral.", "yeah but I really wanted to help my dad pay for the funeral it was over 35k the casket costet us 12k we wanted the best for him and I really want to help my dad he's the best and he has it hard", "ty<3 He was sadly only 17 and was suffering for 15 min before passing away we had to have the casket closed it was so bad :(", "first as i said I don't speak english very well second 30k for therapy and much more my mental health is f0ck3d up after everything, and the reason why the driver hasn't been to jail yet is because we haven't been in court yet and the police officers in sweden are really bad trust me. They let the driver go (Aka was my brothers best friend) because they couldn't find anything on him even if had drinked", "you are a lovely human! I wish you all the best and hope you,  your dad, and siblings all heal as best you can together", "As soon as I went to uni, I left my parents house and went no contact with my mom, but I still try to maintain good terms with my dad. One of the reasons, in spite of some serious disagreements and fights/arguments between us, I cannot bring myself to cut ties with him. This is mainly because he lost his dad to a traumatic brain injury when he was roughly my age, and he spent every free moment by his comatose dad's bedside down until his dad succumbed to his injuries. I couldn't make it where my dad lost both his dad and his son. \n\nMy point is, you will have autonomy over your familial relationships. From what I can tell, your dad really stood up to take care of you and your little siblings. You don't have to let your mom's fragile ego get in the way of that.  Feel free to reach out to me if you need emotional support. I've seen a lot in my short life and I'm always here for anyone who needs it.", "I am so very sorry.", "ty tho someone said it can't be true because I got 30k from my brother death after 2 weeks which we do in sweden it goes fast and I hate when people spread lies like that, I would never lie about someone death either", "It's even WORSE!  It's completely made up!", "people can be hateful jerks both irl and online... you know your truth", "yeah I even have vids of him and pics plus newspaper telling what has happened and go to if you wanna see \n\n<img src=\"https://static.cdn-expressen.se/images/c4/97/c497436fd3cc44f78d4e70a565dfb6da/16x9/original.jpg\" alt=\"Totte Levin, 17, dog i kraschen i H\u00e4ssleholm\"/> \n\nthere you see a pic of him and where he passed away", "it should show up Totte Levin 17 years old died in a hard incident but in swedish", "https://www.expressen.se/tv/nyheter/kvp/totte-levin-17-dog-i-svara-olyckan-i-hassleholm/\n\nThere\u2019s something wrong with that URl but i went and found this one. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and that you have a horrible excuse for a mother. NTA", "thx and yeah that was my brother he sadly died after 15 mins due to the lack of air and ty<33", "[removed]", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Spend your time and money with the family who support you and who you support.", "She's supposed to provide for you. You're a minor. Even without your brother (my condolences) you'd be NTA. Your mom is an ahole visible from space.", "Why does your mother say, \u201cshe didn\u2019t care that her own son passed away\u201d? That is more concerning than whether you attend her second wedding or if you buy an expensive dress you clearly can\u2019t afford? The cost of the bridesmaid dress is outrageous! \n\nThe demand for an expensive wedding gift is pure narcissism.\n\nDid you say you\u2019re 15? Is that 15 years old? Because that is shocking your mother expects any of this from a teenager.\n\nYou need to cut contact with your mother. She is abusive, narcissistic, controlling and trying to commit emotional blackmail.\n\nPlease tell your father about this and let him handle it.", "First off, you're 15 which is not an adult.  Any dress would be purchased by her and not you.   Second, she wouldn't get a gift from me if she didn't care about the death of her own child.  To me, that suggests that she probably doesn't care about the live ones either.  NTA", "NTA", "I do have money but it's for my brother flowers and candles we go to the place he passed away and put flowers every day and Im happy I didn't go to the wedding", "yeah sadly it is real she could pay for my younger siblings but not for me. because I got money after my brother passed away we do get that in sweden so she wanted me to spend them which I will not only for flowers and candles for my dead brother", "Sounds like Mum wants to throw away her past. When she starts having kids with whoever she's getting hitched with, she'll probably start phasing you out too. I'd stay away from that.", "Thank you so much it means a lot to me and I will reach out if I need to talk and you can ask me any question you want :)"]}
