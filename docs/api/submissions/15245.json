That's an understatement on my part.", "NTA. She showed her true colors. She doesn't care about her late son and only want expensive gift. Why bother? Does she even care about you being here or just the expensive gift you could buy?\n\nAnd, on top of that, you're only 15. At what point a mother would except such an expensive gift from her teenager daughter?", "NTA\n\nThere is so much wrong here. One, you are a child....why is she expecting you to pay for this stuff? Two, I really hope some context is missing about your brother passing......because if not your mom is a different level of fucked up. \n\nNTA if you don't go to the wedding or even decide to cut her from your life once you are old enough and able to support yourself fully.", "NTA, I will also suggest you reevaluate your relationship with your mother. her stating she doesn't care is very disturbing.", "Info why is your mother expecting you to pay for your own dress??", "INFO: Did your mother actually say that she doesn't care that her son died or that she doesn't care about the flowers and candles that you wanted to get?

You are 15 and your mother expects you to shell out for an expensive dress and gift?  She should be buying all that for you.  Save your money for stuff to remember your brother instead and start to put some away for the future.  Somehow, I think you will need something to fall back.", "NTA.\n\nI am sorry about your loss. When did your brother die - recently or some time (years) ago?\n\nLet me start by saying, your Mom is not only a bad mother to you and your brother, but also a bridezilla and probably a narcisist.\n\nUsually, when a bride expects her bridesmaids to wear an expensive dress, she pays for the dresses herself or at least chips in. Furthermore, if you are invited to a wedding, it is the social etiquette / the norm to bring a present, but it is **not** a requirement. Demanding a present, especially a present in that price range, is hybris. Acting like that during one's second wedding makes it increasingly tacky.\n\nBut considering you are her (= momzilla/ bridezilla) **underage daughter,** probably still going to school and therefore not earning any 'reasonable' salary, makes it just **extremely wrong** on so many levels.\n\nSHE has a duty as your mother to care for you - monetarily, physically, emotionally, etc. - and not the other way around. To me, it sounds like she abandoned you (and your angel brother) and just tries to \"milk\" you for money or to show to others, what a great Mom she is because you still support her by being a bridesmaid. \n\nOP, please, stop investing any time, money, feelings and emotions towards your Mom. She proved that the only person she *actually* cares for is herself. Her involvement in your life is just toxic. Even though it is hard, you have to do what is best for you. And this is (at this moment) to break contact with her. Take time to grief, heal and get your life back on track. \n\nI send you lots of strength and love to Sweden (?) and hope you are going to do better soon", "NTA. You do not ever have to go to a wedding you don't want to. Also I'm sorry to hear that she doesn't care, and I'm sorry for your loss.", "I have no words for this \"mother\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA  \nYou mom is an obnoxious old bat.  \nShe doesn't get to demand and decide what you wear and what you gift her.  \nBest to stay away from such a toxic person.", "NTA.", "Posts like these prove that the mother is not always the most suitable parent. She sounds toxic AF. Sorry for your loss OP and really hope you live with your dad.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think this is disgusting behaviour and you should cut such awful people out of your life.\n\nMes condol\u00e9ances.", "NTA!  Your mother is disgusting.  You control where your money goes, not her.  Don't spend one cent on her, don't go to the wedding.  I'm so sorry for the loss of your brother.  On her wedding day, go someplace that reminds you of your brother, and have a beautiful day.
