Since our son was 1 week old, my husband has not been home due to him traveling for work on contract. So I am by myself with our son 24/7. I have broken down a good 4-5 times as I feel very alone and overwhelmed with having a newborn by myself while also trying to recover postpartum. My husband expressed once he was home he would allow me a break.\n\nMy husband came home for the holidays and I requested for him not to bring any negative energy into the house once he is home as the baby can feel that, especially since my husband has been away for so long that I just want them to have good bonding in his welcoming back. He became angry at me for this. \n\nFast forward throughout the 2/3 weeks he was home, he barely interacted with our son. He would always be on his phone scrolling through instagram or watching something on YouTube. I gently asked him if he could play and interact with him as this is an important time for them to bond . My husband then accused me of saying that he\u2019s an absent parent. Then if my husband does hold our son, it\u2019s only for 5 minutes and then he\u2019ll say \u201chere, go back to your mother\u201d and hand him back off to me. If our son cries, then he yells at him to stop and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with him, that I\u2019ve just spoiled him and he\u2019s going to break him from that. He never makes our son\u2019s bottles or changes his diapers nor does any of the baby\u2019s laundry or get up with him during the night. Yet, if I\u2019m doing it then he\u2019s criticizing me and telling me that I\u2019m doing it wrong or I\u2019m not doing enough. Keep in mind, I have the baby all day and night. I only eat once a day and I\u2019m usually a good 2 days between showers. \n\nYesterday, I decided I really needed to pamper myself somehow. Prior to pregnancy I loved painting my nails so I thought I would try it again last night. My husband had been in the bathroom for 45 minutes, so I fed our son and strapped him in the baby wrap on me as he fell asleep. I sat in an open area in our home and by the patio door for airflow to come in and I paired my nails using organic products. Any of the products that had a strong smell, I used it quickly and discarded of it. I was completed with my nails at max 25 minutes and my husband comes out of the bathroom stating I am endangering our son and that I\u2019m a selfish mother. He then tries to take our son off of me and I expressed to him that he\u2019s sleeping and I don\u2019t want to wake him as he\u2019s been not feeling well all day. My husband then accuses me of trying to keep his child away from him and that he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me. \n\nI guess I just hit a breaking point in frustration, tiredness, and anxiety that I told my husband to go f himself. I know it was quite extreme and I shouldn\u2019t have said it. I\u2019m just at my wits end of feeling like I\u2019m the only parent and then getting scolded for trying to have *something* that I do for myself.", "created_utc": 1704683975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191b4r2/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_f_himself/", "score": 443, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask him to show you whats the \"correct\" way then. And screaming at 10 week old for crying, claiming its because \"you spoiled him\" ??? That doesn't even make sense, it just seems like your husband has made it his mission to blame you for everything. \nMaybe telling him to f himself is disrespectful, but honestly i think it is deserved considering he had disrespected you multiple times. \nYour husband might be stressed from work but that is not an exuse to be abusive towards you.\nTalk to your husband, tell him how do you feel, ask him why does he keep blaming you. Keep it cool and be as direct as possible with your questions.", "NTA - You\u2019ll never do anything correctly for this man.

Like, I can\u2019t exactly condone using nail polish and stuff next to a newborn - those lungs may be more affected by it - but his behavior is actually abusive. Why are you with him?

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s the type to hit his kids honestly, because that\u2019s the next step when he feels that a less than 2 month old is being a brat for crying.

I won't be surprised if your husband probably locked himself in the bathroom for 45 minutes to masturbate to porn instead of spending that time to bond with his son, help you out, and work on your relationship.

Alimony and child support are more than you\u2019re getting from that loser right now.", "NTA at all. Your husband's words are big red flags. You can't spoil a baby, they have no guile and the only way they can communicate is through crying. So they cry over everything they need whether it is being dirty, itchy, hot, cold, sick or hungry. They also cry when they're tired, overstimulated scared, hurt, or need comfort. \n\nThe fact your husband doesn't understand this or the fact that he's missed a chunk of his newborn's life so he's basically a loud angry stranger is a big deal. \n\nOn top of that he's not just an absent partner but an actively harmful one. He's emotionally damaging you when you're still physically and emotionally recovering from pregnancy and birth. \n\nYou'd be far better off if you started documenting everything and forming an exit plan. You're already living as if you're a single parent while still putting up with his bs. You might as well get rid of the stress he's causing you.\n\n\nI was in the exact same situation, including my ex claiming our 3 week old was a spoiled brat whenever he cried. He never had anything to do with our baby and didn't know the first thing about babies or how to take care of him. He firmly believed that the baby was being manipulative when he cried. \n\nOne day my son had an upper respiratory infection and couldn't breathe well laying flat and his nose was too stuffy for him to safely use a pacifier. I got him to sleep in one of those inclined bouncy cots and told my ex explicitly about the breathing issues and not to lay him down or give him a pacifier because I needed a shower. I got halfway through washing my hair when I suddenly felt a sense of dread and ran out to check my son. He was swaddled tightly and laid flat with a pacifier in his mouth and he was turning blue. My ex had done it and then locked himself in the bedroom and cranked up the volume as he played guitar hero. He even took the batteries out of the baby monitor because he \" didn't want to hear the fake crying\". \n\nI left him immediately because it was clear he was a danger to my son and was being neglectful out of pure spite. I had ignored all the red flags and the hostility towards me but when he became a threat to my child I couldn't sit idly by. You should take this very seriously.", "NTA I second your emotion.", "NTA, your husband is one of those people who will pick on everything you do, while doing nothing himself. What a misery to be around him.", "Do you feel loved in this relationship? Do you feel respected? Really sit down with yourself and think.\n\nIs this a good role model for your son?

I hope you can seek help from friends, family, or a trusted caretaker for your son at least 2 days a week as well as couples counseling for you and your husband. He also needs individual counseling too. I hope and pray you stay safe and get the help you need, OP.", "wow, I do remember how difficult it was being a new father. It can be frustrating at times but your husband, especially being as old as he is, shows zero maturity, and zero empathy for you and your child. And only since his own inability to be a father and bond with his son has been made painfully aware to him, he now starts to project his own inadequacies onto you.

This is not how someone who loves you would treat you.", "Honestly, you shoulda said way more than that to him...he deserves it for treating you, his wife, and mother of his child, like you're nothing. He is not doing his share of parenting, and he doesn't seem like he's fit to be a father.\n\n I feel like you should consider how this behavior can turn into something much worse in the long term. Its already bad enough that he's yelling at a newborn baby for crying...", "NTA\n\nRun. Get OUT.  Get a lawyer. Protect yourself, your baby, and his future.\n\nYour husband doesn't care about either of you. The fact that you had to tell him to be nice before he came home speaks volumes about his character.

That sounds miserable! I\u2019m so sorry\u2014 what was your husband like before your son was born? \n\nThis sounds very toxic and really bad for you, which means bad for your baby. \n\nI think y\u2019all should get into counseling asap. Your husband is being really emotionally destructive and you need to get to the root of it and figure out a way forward as a team that can work together. \n\nYou need him nurturing you so you can properly nurture your child. That kinda stress is the opposite of that.", "Why are you even with this man never mind have a child with him?", "Wow.  Sorry to say, but your husband sounds like a d-bag.  NTA.

If this guy doesn\u2019t stay in the moment with his son, he\u2019ll never know what it is to be a father.  I\u2019m not saying leave him, but counseling is definitely in order.  Heck, take a weekend and leave him with your son.  Well, maybe not, since he sounds a bit (okay, a LOT) impatient and ill equipped.", "And you need some help when he\u2019s gone!", "NTA, sorry to hear (from a male), that's not right.\nYour husband is an asshole and things are about to get much worse.", "NTA- that is horrible treatment of a new mom.\n\nI wonder if he's projecting the guilt he has over being away from his newborn child onto you.\n\nIf so, he needs to zip that.  You make a person feel like a single parent, they start realizing they can do it themselves.\n\nBut right after pregnancy you are recovering and still figuring out what it means to be a parent.\n\nOkay I want you to tell your husband to listen up or look up means the fact that he is yelling at a 10-week-old baby scares the crap out of me.\n\nBabys cry honestly.  Up until a year they cry because their needs need meeting.  After about a year, they realize mom and dad will come when they cry.  And they put two and two together.\n\nSo if your spouse is yelling at a crying baby who truly does not know any better, he needs to wake up call.\n\nI don't know if you have any peer resources or anything like that, but you need help.  Even just someone to talk to", "He should go eff himself, and you should stop.  \n\n\nNTA.  \n\n\nToo bad you have two children now.  \n\n\nAt least you can ditch one.", "Take the baby and run.

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this I know it must feel like you're drowning. \n\nI'm really irked he tried taking the baby from you while you were wearing him and then had the audacity to say what he did.

It's completely wrong headed and alarming that your husband thinks it's okay to yell at a literal newborn. I would suggest leaving him with the baby more if the anger wasn't there because it can be hard to bond with a little baby that's just starting to interact, and you actually bond to the child by taking care of them.

Since our son was 1 week old, my husband has not been home due to him traveling for work on contract. So I am by myself with our son 24/7. I have broken down a good 4-5 times as I feel very alone and overwhelmed with having a newborn by myself while also trying to recover postpartum. My husband expressed once he was home he would allow me a break.\n\nMy husband came home for the holidays and I requested for him not to bring any negative energy into the house once he is home as the baby can feel that, especially since my husband has been away for so long that I just want them to have good bonding in his welcoming back. He became angry at me for this. \n\nFast forward throughout the 2/3 weeks he was home, he barely interacted with our son. He would always be on his phone scrolling through instagram or watching something on YouTube. I gently asked him if he could play and interact with him as this is an important time for them to bond . My husband then accused me of saying that he\u2019s an absent parent. Then if my husband does hold our son, it\u2019s only for 5 minutes and then he\u2019ll say \u201chere, go back to your mother\u201d and hand him back off to me. If our son cries, then he yells at him to stop and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with him, that I\u2019ve just spoiled him and he\u2019s going to break him from that. He never makes our son\u2019s bottles or changes his diapers nor does any of the baby\u2019s laundry or get up with him during the night. Yet, if I\u2019m doing it then he\u2019s criticizing me and telling me that I\u2019m doing it wrong or I\u2019m not doing enough. Keep in mind, I have the baby all day and night. I only eat once a day and I\u2019m usually a good 2 days between showers. \n\nYesterday, I decided I really needed to pamper myself somehow. Prior to pregnancy I loved painting my nails so I thought I would try it again last night. My husband had been in the bathroom for 45 minutes, so I fed our son and strapped him in the baby wrap on me as he fell asleep. I sat in an open area in our home and by the patio door for airflow to come in and I paired my nails using organic products. Any of the products that had a strong smell, I used it quickly and discarded of it. I was completed with my nails at max 25 minutes and my husband comes out of the bathroom stating I am endangering our son and that I\u2019m a selfish mother. He then tries to take our son off of me and I expressed to him that he\u2019s sleeping and I don\u2019t want to wake him as he\u2019s been not feeling well all day. My husband then accuses me of trying to keep his child away from him and that he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me. \n\nI guess I just hit a breaking point in frustration, tiredness, and anxiety that I told my husband to go f himself. I know it was quite extreme and I shouldn\u2019t have said it. I\u2019m just at my wits end of feeling like I\u2019m the only parent and then getting scolded for trying to have *something* that I do for myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP needs to document everything because once she leaves he will undoubtedly lash out at her this needs to be recorded and she needs to stay somewhere safe. call the top divorce attorneys in her area and get a consultation so he can not use those one. she needs to set herself up for the best possible chance to successfully cut all contact and get away from this monster its only a matter of times his anger turns physical. \n\nthis is a very scary situation for him to already be showing such abusive and manipulative behavior as it will just get worse and those business trips im sure he will cheat while on those since he clearly has no respect for her at all. sounds like he just wanted a kid and wife for the appearance to others and to have people he can control. usually i find redditors too quick to jump to divorce or breaking up as couples therapy is always a good option to try if they have the means NOT in this case there is no chance he will respond to therapy \n\nhe might even have narcissistic personality disorder (my dad has it was professionally diagnosed against his will luckily my dad loves me a lot and tried to be a good dad besides being verbally abusive when i was younger but it was nothing as a bad as this guy since my dad wasn\u2019t one to get angry just belittle and criticize constantly, he did always comment on how my mom was doing something wrong and how he wouldve done it better but then doesnt want to do it in the first place. after she left him he got better bcz i went low contact he got a job and got his life together after expierecing a lot of trauma in his life he is palestinian and was discriminated against in the us and fired after 9/11 and that and being around war so early in his childhood messed him up combined with his mental illnesses he is much better now that im adult bcz he realized he would lose his only child if he didnt try to do better) \n\nanyway sorry for the side rant but i just really could see this man having narcassistic personality disorder and wanted to add context from personal experience and my father is a rare case of someone changing even though he still thinks he did nothing wrong and wont seek therapy and it took so many years for him to change and he regresses sometimes on his progress and our relationship is far from the best but i show him compassion bcz he has had a hard life\u2026\n\nhowever OP should NOT because this man is much worse and her safety as well as her childs is in danger she needs to leave for her child asap. specially if he has narcissistic personality disorder combined with anger issues (thankfully my dad never had) those combined are dangerous she needs to get out asap. and reach out to all her support system for help anyone she can rely on to help as this will not be easy at all i cant imagine what else he has said and done she hasnt included in this or simply brushed it off as to not cause an issue of it in fear of his retaliation. some people may not agree just by what she wrote is abuse but i guarantee  he is verbally abusive and manipulative as this is just one incident\n\n**OP PLEASE READ** my moms biggest regret is not leaving my dad earlier for my sake as i have childhood trauma that has effected me very negatively and played a part into my behavior as a teen that led to even worse traumatic events that effect me everyday of my life. so sorry for the long response im not great with editing down my words.\n\nedit- reformatting and additional information about the impact of having a father with narcissistic personality disorder had on my life", "Yeah, I mentioned that in my comment as it is slightly terrifying to me.", "Please also get a recording of him saying that/ red flags.
