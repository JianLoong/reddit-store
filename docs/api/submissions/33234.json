You're both adults, so the only thing I can think of is gender. Which is horribly gross and misogynistic. Given that context, I'm not even mad at the language you used.", "NTA. The irony here is that they probably wouldn't care if *you* had guys (edited once you mentioned you are gay) over, but your step sister of the exact same age is to be protected and shielded from the very same behaviors? It's super archaic thinking, and honestly it's nice that you went up to bat for her. I get that your family sounds close and all, but your siblings need to back off. There is no reason why everyone in the family should stick their nose in your step sister's love life, especially if they wouldn't do it for other members of the family. I also come from a family where swearing was the key to dialog so I get it, it was a perfectly normal response for someone who doesn't want to control their sibling, who again, is the exact same age as you and therefore should theoretically be allowed to do what you do.", "Would they rather she go to the guys\u2019 houses?

Sure it would have been better if she didn't say anything but she's young and probably thought she was doing the right thing even if it ended up with all this drama.", "NTA\n\nShe's 24, not 14. Your parents need to be put in their proper place. You gave them the appropriate response to their BS. If they don't like your response, too bad.

Your little sister is 15, she can't have boys over because her mommy and daddy won't let her; when she grows up and moves out, she can also fuck whoever she wants too.\n\nIf any of them want to bring this up, tell them you'll talk about it when they agree to buy chastity belts and let you be the only one to have the keys.", "NTA.

You could have been less insulting about it, but they're trying to control what their adult daughter does in her own home. They have no right to do that, it's her life.

I didn\u2019t agree with every choice my adult children made, but I stayed out of it unless they asked my advice, or else I knew they\u2019d push me away, and I wanted to be there for them when they really needed me. It would be foolish to think young hormonal adults aren\u2019t horny, lol! So I did the next best thing and tried to prevent them from getting stds and pregnant. Is religion a part of this? That tends to muddy the waters, but as adults, you get to choose how to live your lives. Good luck and I hope your parents learn to understand and yall can have a healthy relationship.", "NTA.

I bought a house with my then-boyfriend (now-husband) at 24. My mom was married with her first baby at 24 (my parents married at 21, which seems super young to be me these days but still a fully grown adult). And they think they still have a say?\n\nIt'd be one thing to caution your adult child to be careful who they bring home for safety reasons (ex: if they're bringing home hookups). To say she CAN'T have guys over? Wut? And it doesn't seem like a safety issue even if it was a hookup, since it's not like she's alone with a stranger \u2014 you're there. \n\nNTA.

It\u2019s at the point where they must be actively sabotaging my ability to be independent (they definitely are) and it\u2019s moving me backwards in life. My parents have done similar to what yours are trying to do to your sister and that was just how they started. It\u2019s very likely they will escalate, it\u2019s just hard to know to what extreme.\n\nDo they live anywhere near y\u2019all? If so, except random drop ins. Do they have a key? If so, get the locks changed and do not give them a new copy. If they live nearby and have their own key, then they absolutely will let themselves in whether or anyone is home. That means snooping if they drop in an no one is home. It will likely just be your sister\u2019s room, but it should still be an issue to you. Does your sister have her own car? Do your parents possibly have the spare key to the car? If so, she\u2019s going to want to keep an eye on how your parents question her plans/movements. Maybe they start to seem like they know what she\u2019s up to or where she is without her telling them\u2026 if that happens they may have put a tracking device in the car. If I were her I\u2019d check every once in a while for random tracking devices in the car, even if they don\u2019t say anything to make her suspicious. Check outside the car as well if she ever does random searches to see if they\u2019ve put on a tracking device. They can be stuck to the outside of the car if someone doesn\u2019t have the ability to get in the car and hide it.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to seem dramatic, it\u2019s very possible your parents don\u2019t escalate in such major ways to the point of stalking her, but I wanted to create a picture of what they could potentially escalate to if they act up more and more. My parents have stalked me, caused legal issues for me, and have caused me to go in to pretty major debt. It was all over their own control issues and obsession over retaining control over me.

Your parents sheltered you to the point of being unbearable", "And I can tell you\u2019re a crappy little racist. First of all, brown as brown comes. Secondly, stop acting like you know every situation better than the person in the situation. You got such a narcissistic and nasty attitude, no wonder your support parents who demand praise for doing the bare minimum, you demand praise for it too. I hope you have the day you deserve and get the mood you give to others.", "Love that three of you have each other. Shame your parents can\u2019t see what cool kids they have, and your brother isn\u2019t included in that. \n\nI don\u2019t much like your brother based on your description.", "I would bet anything that the only reason the let her move in with you. Is they thought they would still have control over her through you.", "You seem like a really good brother.", "My mom would swear up and down she didn't have a favorite, but she CLEARLY did. She was kind and loving to all of us, but she clearly adored our brother the most (her first child, her only boy). Then my sister, who was the responsible one and literally helped run the household because she's very take charge. Then me, I'm the \"weird one.\" Read: the most liberal and opinionated one and the least like my parents in terms of personality/life choices \u2014 my sister and my dad basically shared a personality, and my brother was pretty much the golden child, but he's a great guy and I harbor no ill will about it (he was popular in school, is charming, successful, etc \u2014 even the times he got in trouble for shenanigans in school, the teachers would still gush to my parents about what a nice kid he was so he never got in real trouble, and it was true, he was never a mean spirited or spoiled kid). \ud83d\ude02 It's OK, I know she loved me too, she never treated me poorly or openly showed favoritism. I never really felt bad about it, but my parents didn't openly shun me or treat me shitty or do things for them that they didn't do for me. But my sister and I used to sometimes gently tease her about our brother being the favorite, and she would vehemently deny it even though she clearly thought he hung the moon.\n\nI get that when you have multiple kids, you have different personalities in the household, and you might unintentionally get along with one better than the others (I don't have kids, but that seems like human nature). But I can't imagine openly showing it or only claiming an \"only son\" when you have 2 sons. WTF? \n\nAnd now these people are trying to use OP to control their grown daughter/stepdaughter. Absolutely wild.", "Well I feel like everyone is at that age. Give him a chance once he\u2019s an adult too", "Tell him it's because you grew up without a strong male figure.", "That sucks. Again, I'm sorry.", "Im sorry. It sucks having sucky parents.", "What\u2019s wrong with getting plowed? It\u2019s fun! you should fix up that personally of yours and try it sometime.", "So your assumption went to \u201cgetting plowed\u201d rather than the \u201cdifferent and totally normal\u201d dating. You may not believe this, but women also have male friends where no \u201cplowing\u201d or dating is involved.", "so you're slut shaming, then. just proving the other dudes point that you're misogynistic", "It\u2019s clear to me that you don\u2019t understand how adult women, friendships or relationships work in the modern world. Communicating like adults would be this:\n\nParents: Hey daughter, who\u2019s your friend?\nDaughter: This is so and so.\n\nIt\u2019s not that complicated.", "I have a feeling I've been in the real world longer than you've even been alive. Your projection is painfully obvious. I know the phrase \"touch grass\" is clich\u00e9 and tired, but it applies to you very abundantly.", "same standard for men?", "True but you come across as sound so I doubt we are related. The rest of my brothers and sisters are all as messed up as I am I guess so we try to avoid each other. I have a siter 8mls in one direction, another about 25mls, in the opposite and I haven't seen either in over 5yrs. Dysfunctional!! \ud83d\udc4d", "White ahh reply I'm fine and well respected really I js hate assholes suck it up you chose to reply so suck it up", "That isn't racism that's assuming but okay plus wym by brown as brown comes and I'm narcissistic btw you don't tell me how to speak after what you js said\ud83d\udc80 oh I'd tell my parents to flip of bla bla bla shut up you have no rights to speak after what you said lmaoo and have a good day to ypu too ig", "The golden child 'sometimes' turns into a spoiled brat, that thinks the world revolves around them, in so many ways. Its sad to see.", "I was thinking the same thing, they thought they could control her through OP, which is the only reason they \"allowed\" it. Love that they're getting a rude awakening but hope it doesn't mean that they try to stop the younger sister from moving out when she's old enough.", "My parents couldn't remember what day I was born on for over a decade (and that's just one example). I corrected them when I looked at my birth certificate when I was 12. It was incredibly embarrassing to have to tell everyone my birthday is on a different day. When I bring it up (and I do, because it's funny) she STILL gets defensive - I'm 45! She had 2 kids, 5 years apart. Her labor was unremarkable. I've given her every opportunity to claim an excuse, she doesn't want one. She just got confused.\nBut they got theirs as I said, and are stuck with me until they die. Which hopefully won't be too much longer.", "He's 22 now, only 2 years younger than the sister. He isn't a teenager anymore.", "#nailedit", "Short term gratification in exchange for long term sorrows. Small minded thinking", "So it's a platonic friend that the family knows about? That's a bit different, but it's mentioned very broadly in the story. I doubt the parents are anal about a friend that they know and trust going over there. You likely just need to assume the worst without the required context tbh.", "Did you just call her a slut? I didn't. That's pretty misogynistic of you.", "Projection, lmao. Right, right. Obviously if it's something you disagree with, the opposing person is projecting or is an incel right?", "Yes", "I speak to my siblings everyday, none of us were the Golden Child and were all equally screwed up by our mom. So we get along quite well lol. They\u2019re the only reason I am a slightly functioning adult.", "Yea, really fighting that racism allegation.", "Well respected by other narcissists isn\u2019t a flex", "Empty headed much. I\u2019m brown as brown comes and yes you assuming I\u2019m white does in fact make you racist.\n\nYou are narcissistic, demanding others respect you simply cause you gave them life? Narcissism. Thinking your way of life should be what everyone strives for? Narcissism. But you can pretend you aren\u2019t all you want, that\u2019s what narcissists do anyways.\n\nAgain, have the day and mood you give others."]}
