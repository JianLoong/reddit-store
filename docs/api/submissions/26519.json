I packed my essentials for the two weeks we would be there. Ill admit it was still quite alot but it wasnt inane.\n\nNo the room i was staying in i was sharing with one of SILs nieces near my age, the bedroom has an en-suite bathroom. i put my things on a shelf, i made sure with the niece that i wasnt taking up too much room.\n\nSIL came in to check on us and saw all my things, she asked about some things i had since they were expensive brands (shes made it a big point that she and her family have a lot more money than my family over the years). I told her i saved and got them myself (i have a job). She asked to use them and i said no, bc they were expensive and i want them to last as longa s possible. She seemed annoyed but just left.\n\nOver the next few days my SIL wac complaining that her skin was dry and itchy, i ididt think anything of it. Half way through the stay she came storming down the stairs and thew a small spray bottle at me, asking me why the fuck i did this to her. I was confused and asked what she meant. Turns out shes been going into the bathroom i share with her niece and using my skin care, but shes been using what she thought was a spray bottle of water at the end, but shes actually been using a bottle of salt water which i have bc i have 4 pretty fresh earpeircings.\n\nAt first ia sked why the fuck shes using my stuff, she said its her family\u2019s house so she can use it, i tell her no, its my stuff and i said no. she just reiterated her first point and then asked my i would trick her like this, i explained that its salt water for my ears but she just called my a lair, asking why i would have it on the bathroom shelf next to the rest of my skincare stuff. She then went on about how i purposely ruined her skin.\n\nI again tried explaining myself, SIL then turns to my mother and her mother and said she had asked about my skincare and i had explained everything and said the bottle was water, which was total bs, she only asked about my expensive ones. Her niece backed me up but SIL called niece a liar, MIL was pissed and said im horrible and just jealous of SIL and my mother said shes disappointed and embarrassed at me.\n\nThis then caused she and my dad to argue and now i feel like shit. SILs family and my mother are ignoring me or being passive-aggressive. And they even threw out my salt water and wont let em make a new batch, and have stopped me when i try. I dont know what to do, AITA?\n\nEDIT: i had to removed this bc of character limit but i think ive confused some people, this isnt my dad's family, this is my brother's wife's (SIL's) family  \n\n\nAlso while salt water is normally ok for your skin, daily exposure isnt, plus it might not even be the salt water, could very well be that she had a bad reaction to another product, what works for one person might not work on another. i just had a few people asking about that", "created_utc": 1694264974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e5dxs/aita_for_tricking_my_sil_and_ruining_her_skin/", "score": 6264, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would've just lied and told her the salt water does go on my face as a toner or something and it's not my fault we have different skin /ph balances/sensitivity or something and that was precisely one of the reasons you told her not to use your products.

His family is abusive.", "NTA. Also, to your mother: there is a special place in Hades for parents who don't believe their children due solely to their own lack of attentiveness.

She didn't listen. How much was she spraying on her face? Shouldn't that have helped exfoliate her skin kind of like a sugar scrub?", "NTA. She tried to steal from you, and somehow failed to read the bottle. \n\nThat stuff isn't a horribly strong salt content, so I don't know how much damage it can do. A dip in the ocean is probably saltier. \n\nThe rest of your family is apparently clueless.", "\nNTA\nShe was told no and snuck in to use it anyways.

That's just some petty spoiled bullshit.", "Everybody except the niece and OP are complete A-holes...", "NTA \n\nAnd while I have no idea of your life\u2026.is your style more alternative? Do they perhaps conflate that with your sexuality? My question I suppose is, is this not only coming from classism but bigotry?", "She asked if she could use your things, and you said no. She decided to take them anyway. It's her own fault if anything affected her skin. You're definitely NTA but everyone else (apart from niece) is TA. How can your own mother say you embarrassed her?? She'd rather believe a liar and a thief over her own daughter??", "NTA\n\nA thief suffered the consequences of not knowing what she was using on her skin and is victim blaming you.", "Oh if only crappy behavior always had such instant consequences. Serves her right.\n\nShe ignored your wish, went behind your back to steal from you but was too stupid to even do that right.\n\nNTA", "Go home your step family looks horrible. the good thing in fzire in my opinion would be to not have any more contact with those who mistreated you until you have had an apology from them and they have refunded the products thrown away", "NTA. Pretty galling when someone steals something and isn't happy with the results. You need to have a serious talk with your mom for throwing you under the bus. This entitled toddler not only stole but then lies and manipulates everyone.\n\nCan you leave?", "NTA. Your SIL is a dirty thief and she fucked around and found out.

If someone tells me not to touch a stove thats on and I touch it anyway and get burnt, I don\u2019t get mad at the person because I myself thought it would be ok. Same thing here. NTA", "NTA. But it isn't safe to make your own salt water like that. For now you should be able to just rinse them off in the shower water. Don't touch them. If you go to a pharmacy anytime soon you can get saline spray.", "Do you have a dad?  Maybe it\u2019s time to talk to him.  NTA", "NTA", "NTA \n\nNext time you visit our a little 'toxic' or skull and crossbones sticker on all your products. F that robbing, lying piece of work.", "NTA. It's sad that your family drove you to the point where you started to doubt this. She stole from you. And wtf if up with them stopping you from replacing the salt water?? This isn't normal. They're assholes and controlling.", "NTA - She already asked you and you said no but she used your stuff anyway. \n\nWhen I travel, I also use random containers to store other stuff.

You\u2019re a 29 year old bullying me, a minor. An evil person like you deserve that. You\u2019re a manipulating btch and a liar and this is your karma. \n\nIf the adults are not backing you up, I will just raise hell really. Embarrass the sht out of that lady, hopefully she gets knocked down a peg or two. Screw family members like that you dont need them. Disappointed in your mom for not backing you up", "SIL is suffering from angry thief got caught syndrome.  NTA", "NTA. Tell your mother you want to talk to her privately. Then tell her, that you are pretty disappointed in her: You are her son, she should know that you aren't lying. Her taking the side of the entitled liar hurts pretty badly. Ask her if her favoring your brother over you is really that strong that she rather defends his lying wife than actually taking your side. She can't actually believe that \"Your stuff is in my house so I'm entitled to use it even if you said no!\" is a vali argument.\n\nIf tht doesn't help go to your Dad and ask him to take you home since you are obviously not welcome anymore and you don't want to cause anymore entitled incidents.", "NTA. She fucked around and found out. That's not on you. \n\nAlso, isn't salt water supposed to be good for skin?", "Call a family meeting. Say that in the interest of family relations and getting along, you want to 'admit' SIL was not told the bottle had salt water. That you were so, so wrong, and deeply apologize for thinking that just telling SIL not to use the products would be enough, and you have learned your lesson. In the future, you will definitely never rely on simply requesting someone not to use your products, you will be sure to protect anyone from ever getting hurt again...by always locking up the dangerous salty water.

I\u2019m probably going to be reiterating some things that have already been said, but here\u2019s some things you can/should do.\n\n1) Get your dad to take you to the store and get a small carrying case for your products that you can put everything in then easily pack it away in your suitcase. Designate this case as for travel only (even if travel is across town for the night, still travel only) so that you can keep it with your luggage and not lose it. Once you have that, put everything in it and keep it with you in your luggage/room for the rest of the time you\u2019re at SIL\u2019s place.\n\n2) Your mother actually probably does back you up, but since the trip is planned for two weeks total, she is probably trying to not \u201crock the boat\u201d since theoretically there is still one more week to go under the SIL\u2019s family\u2019s roof and siding against them would likely make the remainder of the stay absolutely miserable for your family. Regardless, she SHOULD be backing you up. If this behavior of your mom\u2019s is a common occurrence, ask her if she is ready to have very limited to no contact with you in some months when you turn 18 and go to college/move out. Just that thought might be enough of a shock to at least shut her mouth, if not start siding with you.\n\n3) SIL and her family. Ask them why, if they have so much more money than you and your family, did she resort to stealing your products after you told her no. Ask them if they are actually so poor that they can\u2019t afford products that you, a 17 year old with a minimum wage job, we\u2019re able to save up for and purchase on your own. Demand reimbursement or replacement for the products that she stole, as well as for the salt water wash that they disposed of. Did they only empty the spray bottle? Or did they throw that away? Add that (admittedly cheap) amount to the total reimbursement. Even if you HAD agreed to allow her the use of your products, she still shouldn\u2019t have used them because they are a part of your health care routine, and what if there had only been enough to last you for the travel time. Her using them would have resulted in you running out, which would have then led to potential problems for you.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping your dad does figure out a way to get you two out of there and at least to a hotel if not home. Make it clear to your mom that you are taking this action and leaving her there on her own because SHE refuses to support her child over the \u201crich\u201d hosts that are allowing her this holiday. Still get that travel case ASAP because that will actually be a long term help. Also, get a wound wash for your piercings. While making your own does help, it may not be enough to prevent infections. If you absolutely need to keep making your own, take the time to look up what proportions to use to make an appropriate sterile wash (usually it\u2019s labeled by percentage on bottles, so calculate it out). You likely need a lot more salt than you think for it to be a true saline solution, and you should also be using distilled water to remove any impurities from the water that the salt won\u2019t take care of.

Commercial applicators use things like pressurization to ensure contaminants don't get into the container.

You gave poor advice that can cause unnecessary stress for OP and I corrected the record.", "You're probably fine then :) also NTA, by a long shot.\n\nIf you want to get precise results for concentration, get yourself a graduated cylinder and a scale. 0.9% w/V is 9g NaCl per 700 mL H2O. Use distilled water. Measure it out again after you boil it and top it back off to 700mL again in the (sterile) graduated cylinder with more (sterilized) water after you've boiled it and dissolved the salt into the water to make sure it's back up to the correct volume of solution (and hence correct concentration). Clean hands, sterile gloves if you have them, clean countertops, work quickly and over a flame if you have one and use sterilized metal tongs to handle everything.\n\nOr just get commercial solution. It shouldn't be that expensive. Probably much cheaper than a scale and a graduated cylinder actually, which are the correct tools for the job to make sure you're getting the right concentration.
