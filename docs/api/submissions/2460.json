Flashing their headlights at you & peeping their car horns?\n\nOnly guys are going to call you an AH for this - it's all right for them, easy as pie, but it's simply not that easy for women.\n\nYou paid to have the car cleaned - no damage done.\n\nNTA", "NTA & I don\u2019t think people are really paying attention to the situation here. \n\nYou had already held it for 40 minutes, that\u2019s nearly an hour of constant discomfort & at that point probably pain from holding SO much for SO long. Everyone\u2019s telling you that you should\u2019ve gone outside, & more specifically to \u201callow him to pull over\u201d yet all apparently missed the fact that you were caught in traffic due to an accident. That IS NOT safe. If you\u2019re on a highway caught in traffic you DO NOT leave your car. If traffic was stopped it could have started moving while you were out, & then your boyfriend would\u2019ve had to keep it backed up waiting for you. If traffic was moving, by your post it must have been moving SLOW, & since it was caused by an accident it\u2019s safe to assume there was probably a lot of merging & a lane or two shut down, absolutely furthering it being both stupid & dangerous to leave the car. Not to mention public urination is a crime that can slap you on the sex offenders registry, as well as pulling over on the *left lane* of a highway *also being illegal* so idk why so many people are saying you should have done that instead. The left of a highway is the meridian, unless you\u2019re in a literal vehicle emergency it is illegal & incredibly dangerous to pull over there, not to mention the clusterfuck of an accident ahead. \n\nYour boyfriend may have asked you not to pee in the car, but he clearly wasn\u2019t taking into consideration (or caring about) your safety & discomfort. A little dribbling on the seat that you\u2019ve paid to be professionally cleaned is nothing. If he didn\u2019t want you to pee in his car then maybe he should\u2019ve found a bathroom for you within those 40 minutes you were already holding it. It\u2019s so much easier for a man to just step out of the car & whip his thing out to pee than it is for a woman to literally pull her pants & underwear down & squat on the side of the road. Not to mention if you had gone outside, you could have returned with pee soaked pants/underwear & shoes, much worse than a little dribbling on the seat.", "NTA and wondering if everyone who says you're the asshole and should've gone on the side of the road realizes that public urination is illegal and you'll definitely get arrested if a cop drives by. And if they decide it's indecent exposure, surprise, it's a sex crime! Your boyfriend's asking you to leave the car put you at unnecessary risk. A couple dribbles of pee is easily cleaned, and you got the car professionally cleaned at your expense anyway, so as far as I can tell he's being a giant baby and doesn't care about your safety.", "The first thing I thought about, as a woman, was being out in the open, surrounded by strangers, with my pants down. \n\nAbsolutely not, not even if my bladder exploded instead. \n\nI\u2019m not a wilting flower but some things leave you so vulnerable, or *feeling* vulnerable that they\u2019re a no go automatically. \n\nAlone on a stretch of highway, sure. IF my husband got out and stood guard, even though we\u2019re alone. \n\nI just can\u2019t. Women die far too much for me to ever feel safe enough to do this.", "Just an fyi they now make these devices that allow women to pee more \u201caccurately\u201d.  Apparently it is like a funnel w the other end made to go around your lady parts and they r disposable.  You still have to have a container to pee into or they advertise it allows women to pee standing up.  I know some people use them at concerts", "Okay hold up. NTA\n\nIt is just pee.\n\nPeople forget that peeing outside oftentimes is a ticketable offense, kr worse if you get a cop in a bad mood. And you had his car detailed!  Pee is not a smell that is challenging to remove. \n\nThe fact that everyone here is giving you shit for it is sad. Had you been pregnant, I bet the reaction would have been different.", "INFO: is it legal to pee outside where you live? Where I live people are arrested for that.", "NTA. I can't with all these people saying you should have got out in bumper to bumper traffic. Just an absolute lack of common sense. You even had it cleaned afterwards.", "Was OP saying she paid to have his car detailed a quick edit or something? Because people are missing it and it seems to contribute to some y t a comments. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s not easy for women to pee outside a car unexposed. Are some of you forgetting our anatomy? The clothes we may wear which may contribute to the difficulty (dresses/skirts much easier than any type of pants/shorts)? They possibly had options, like leaving the door open and him covering her with a blanket or jacket or something, if available, on the other side, but it sounds like they didn\u2019t explore or consider that option which isn\u2019t really anyone\u2019s fault. Sometimes in a situation like that, when you have to pee really bad, you can be more panicky and frantic than logical. OP only missed the bottle a little initially - again, as a female, foreseeable, AND YES as she said she paid to have it cleaned. NTA, boyfriend is for still being mad even after she had it cleaned. He needs to get over it, next time he can try to help her cover herself outside if he\u2019s that concerned.", "NAH\n\nI do believe you're both reasonable. Him not wanting to have his car filled with piss, and you not wanting to be seen.\n\nAs long as you paid for the cleaning, I don't see the problem.", "NTA!!! I feel very strongly about this. Depending on the area you were in, it could have been impossible to just walk off the side of the road a little bit due to hazards or just the way the road is set up. It could have been dangerous, you could have been exposed to other cars, it would have just sucked. Men don't understand how difficult it is to pee in the woods as a woman. If you were wearing jeans it would have been a whole ordeal. YOU PEED IN A HYDRO FLASK IT WAS OBVIOUSLY AN URGENT SITUATION I don't know anyone that would do that willingly. It was obviously the only choice you felt safe with. You got his car detailed!!! It's truly not that big of a deal. My bf's dog has peed in my car. He carpet cleaned it out and it's no biggie. There's no reason for your bf to be so upset when you had no other choice and you fixed the problem after. Your bf sucks lol", "NTA\n\nDudes pee in bottles all the time. The dou le standard is ridiculous. You could legit be charged as a sex offender for peeing on the side of the road.", "I love these posts, in the scheme of life is this really worth fighting over? She needed to pee, she did her best to not mess up the car, and paid to get it cleaned. OP, you should find someone who cares about you. NTA", "It's an indecent exposure if she was caught doing it. Women can't surreptitiously pee like men can.  She had his car cleaned.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nWTH...why would he want you to pee where everyone can see you. You had his whole car detailed too so it's not like you were inconsiderate of the dribble you left.", "NTA you held it 40 minutes, you were tipsy, there were probably cops around (getting naked enough to pee in public is illegal lol), and you had his car detailed after it happened he\u2019s just being an AH at that point.", "NTA and how anyone says otherwise is ridiculous. It would be indecent exposure if she did it at the side of the road", "I'm gonna say NTA cause you paid for professional cleanup and it's not like you just let loose your bladder on the seat. Unfortunately there is always the dreaded double standard.\n\n My SO once peed on a box of my shoes because he was half drunk, half asleep and I didn't give him any (read: much) grief and I threw those shoes away.\n\nMy mom still gives my dad grief over a basket of clean laundry my dad peed on while sleep walking, although in good humor.\n\nHe will be TA if he doesn't let this blow over and become a funny story for the future.", "NTA\n\nMy husband, his sister, and their dad were trapped in awful traffic when they were kids and the sister had to pee in a bottle in the backseat. Piss happens, and I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone whose anatomy precludes a quick, mostly-covered piss to expose themselves to the public.", "NTA if you didn't do what you did, you probably would have peed all over the seat.plus you had the car detailed. That's an expensive pee. Maybe you should find someone who appreciates your special place more than he does", "NTA. You did the best you could in the situation.", "NTA. At the height of Covid my ex boyfriend dislocated his knee and it moved completely around his leg and back. He obviously couldn\u2019t drive and he lived with his mom who had advanced MS and was in a wheelchair so he couldn\u2019t drive and she wasn\u2019t able to take him to the ER. I picked him up and took him but they wouldn\u2019t let me go in with him. After about an hour and a half I realized I had to pee and the hospital wasn\u2019t going to let me in. I couldn\u2019t risk leaving because the ER was busy and I didn\u2019t know if I would still have a parking spot. Obviously, like any sane person as opposed to peeing myself I grabbed an empty Gatorade bottle and just dealt with it after. You straight up had it detailed so I\u2019m not sure why he\u2019s mad.", "NTA it obviously isnt the ideal to pee in your water bottle but between getting some pee on the seat and possibly falling onto the ground while crouching to pee while also being surrounded by other cars, this was the better option. you paid for the detailing so i imagine there isnt a smell in the car now, so its water (pee?) under the bridge", "NTA\n\nAs someone who's done it as a male, it's near impossible to pee outside unless there's bushes for cover (even then, you want several), and I say this as someone who's in a part of the world where indecent exposure laws aren't really a thing. I can't imagine how hard this would be in a situation where you don't have any of those luxuries.", "Ahem - middle aged lady here (the cool is debatable). Ladies, you do not have to pee in a cup and possibly have urine running down your legs, risk a ticket from an annoyed cop, getting filmed by passersby, etc. Get the jumbo diapers and keep a couple in your car. Tuck one under your butt and go. Several of my friends have used them when stuck in traffic (hello, Chicago holiday traffic + accident, I\u2019m looking at you). \n\nAnd if BF doesn\u2019t want you peeing in his car, he better not have kids.\n\nETA: NTA, obviously.", "NTA. I wonder how many people saying YTA are men...  \nWoman here. I can't imagine many situations more humiliating than pulling my pants and underwear down in front of literally hundreds of people and then squatting. Lots of people saying \"go further from the road\" but some highways have those wall dividers very close to the right lane or the median with a full view of the other lane... we don't know what you're working with. Regardless, it's illegal and humiliating. You did the right thing by getting it detailed.", "For future reference (assuming this is in a left hand drive area), if he pulls over, angles his car a bit towards the lanes, and you leave your front door open, no one will be able to see anything.  I mean, they'll probably know you're peeing, but they won't be able to see it.    \nIf he has a 4 door, it's even easier.  Just open your door and the door behind you.    \nI'll say NAH, just cause you got everything cleaned up.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think some people understand how hard it is to squat and pee. And you were wearing Jean shorts? You\u2019d have to get naked from the waist down. Your bf sounds like he is an A H though if he he let you sit in pain for 40 mins.", "NTA. You held it for FORTY MINUTES, that\u2019s no small feat. No one wants to be seen peeing in public and it\u2019s way harder for women. You did the best you could- would he prefer you wet yourself all over the seat?", "NTA.\n\nNot like you showered the interior with piss and tbh I think your BF should also respect you wanting privacy. You held it in as long as you could. You had to go.", "When you gotta go you gotta go.\n\nIt can cause kidney problems holding in your wee too long. I've always held in my wee as I was too afraid to go in school and now I'm just used to it and have to remind myself to go and now I suffer badly with UTIs and get kidney problems.\n\nI know it's one time but still. We're not meant to hold it in and it HURTS when you badly need to go! \n\nNo way I'd get out the car and expose myself, yes could open car doors etc but I'd still feel exposed to people especially knowing pervs could be watching and I'd just be too uncomfortable! \n\nYou offered to clean up the mess so what. It's a little pee. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You tried your best and had the car cleaned.\n\nIf he's still grumpy he may not be worth hanging on to! My hubby had to pee urgently and used a bottle once because we couldn't pull over safely. I wouldn't have been angry if he accidentally spilled. Some bodily functions wait for no one. You just do your best and he should be more mature about it. Wait until one day your water breaks in bed - it happened to me! You just clean it and move on. Stuff happens.", "Oh my lord, men pee on or in whatever suits their fancy like every 4 seconds but god forbid a woman do it.\n\nYou were desperate (I personally know how an emergency like that HURTS), you tried to pee into something, it\u2019s an offence to pee in a public place - ie: you could have been ticketed if a cop was nearby \u2014- AND you had his car detailed. \n\nNTA.", "NTA because you already offered to pay for the damage you did cause, accident or not. You had a human function you needed to take care of and I don\u2019t know many females comfortable squatting on the side of the road with a traffic jam\u2026. Even in a bush is a stretch for me lol", "NTA, and anyone saying different has no idea how much harder it is for women to pee outside. There was heavy traffic so therefore there would be TONS of people that would possibly see her exposed, and she was obviously not comfortable with that. She seemed to come prepared and she even had it cleaned, so I don't see what the issue is. Once again, NTA.", "NTA it's just pee, it's illegal to do it outside, not as easy for a woman to do than for men you paid for his car getting cleaned. I may have put something on the seat to try and prevent leaking like I did when someone I know had really bad hemorragic period, I just put some random papers that were in the car, on her seat.\nOnce again, it's just pee. You could've shat yourself that it wouldn't matter as you paid for it to be cleaned.", "NTA. How did he expect you to go on the side of the road if cars are backed up and not moving? Literally everyone would have been able to see. And you paid to clean the car even though it\u2019s just pee and sanitization would\u2019ve sufficed in my opinion. \nTruthfully, you should have used the restroom before heading back because that\u2019s just a good rule of thumb but hindsight is 20/20.", "INFO When did you realize that you needed to go and when did you say something? You said you held it for 40 minutes did he refuse to take an exit?", "NTA. It\u2019s just urine - and a small amount at that. You cleaned it up, and you\u2019d already held it for an unreasonable amount of time. It\u2019s not healthy or safe for women especially to hold it for a really long time, so frankly I think your BF is being a jerk and overreacting. This kind of stuff happens sometimes - it\u2019s life - and he needs to grow up and be more mature about it.", "NTA \n\nAt first I thought you went in the car.. as in, on a seat. What you did is normal.", "INFO - what were you wearing, pants or a dress/skirt? This pertains to how easily you could've peed outside without actually exposing yourself.\n\nETA - given OP's response, I'm gonna go against the grain and say NAH. She was wearing jean shorts and couldn't pee on the highway without exposing herself to dozens upon dozens of strangers. She paid to have his car cleaned and made amends.", "NTA. \n\nYour other body fluids are perfectly fine when y\u2019all are having sex, but ~~sterile~~ urine is where he draws the line? It was clearly an emergency. You peed into a container, got his car detailed. He needs to grow up.\n\nEdit: apparently I was wrong and urine isn\u2019t sterile. Original point still stands. He\u2019s fine with some body fluids and not others.

(No idea what your traffic was except \"bad.\" The BF sounds like the asshole since he didnt do what he could to help you get to a place with a bathroom.)\n\nIts surprising all the YTAs, Im assuming most are men and dont understand how different peeing is for women, and in PUBLIC", "NTA.  At some point you just can't hold it anymore. Public urination is illegal, and indecent exposure is a sex crime.\n\nAlso, the side of the road during a traffic jam due to an accident is not the safest place to pop a squat.", "NTA . The people in here acting like human urine is the equivalent of cat urine is weird. If your hydrated and didn\u2019t eat asparagus it shouldn\u2019t smell that bad. I just had to do this while trapped on i90 the other weekend. It is your responsibility to make sure it\u2019s clean so Get a bissel and really get it. ( if for some reason you have cat smelling pee then go to the pet store and get the enzyme spray) Also they make a thing called a go girl that\u2019s a funnel specifically for women I\u2019d recommend getting one for the future. But being expected to drop your pants to be outside with traffic is kinda crazy. Even with the doors open it\u2019s still really uncomfortable.", "ugh..get a new bf. NTA\n\nIts not like you intentionally peed on his seat, you were being resourceful.", "nta, women and afab people have limited options when it comes to that sort of thing, it was unreasonable for him to ask a tipsy woman to get out and expose herself potentially in front of what could be loads of people", "NTA\n\nIdeally you wouldn't have peed in his car but it was an EMERGENCY. If you could have held it longer, then it wouldn't be an issue but you couldn't.\n\nAlso, isn't it illegal to pee in public?

I'm sure it was embarrassing, and for him to be mad about it is completely unfair.  My wife once sneezed while pregnant and peed in my car seat.  I didn't get mad or shame her.

Assuming that \"detailed\" included shampooing the seat, you've made things right.\n\nNTA", "NAH you wouldn't be the first female to squat and go but I understand why he's annoyed", "Ehh NAH.. but you really could have pissed on the road because I garauntee unless he was driving a fucking rig people still saw you doing it.", "NTA that\u2019s actually illegal to get out and do it PLUS you paid to have it cleaned.

But if you werent comfortable with that or you were in the middle of the road, you did what you had to do.", "NTA and here's my reasons:\n\n1) unsafe. Getting out during traffic is never safe. Peeing between your doors in the middle of traffic is not safe. What if someone stops paying attention and rear ends the car? What if traffic starts moving again?\n\n2) public indecency in most places- level of exposure needed to pee as a woman could land you as a sex offender if you get unlucky and encounter a cop with a chip on their shoulder especially\n\n3) urination in public may also be illegal where you are, as it is in many places. Cop issue applies here again\n\n4) smart phones. Everyone has one, and if you're in especially bad traffic we're talking hundreds of bored and likely irritated people. At least one of them will film you. \n\n5) You paid for a detail and also tried to use a bottle.\n\n6) you held it for 40 minutes, presumably to the point of pain\n\nI think you did your best.

Tell your bf that next time he complains about you peeing and then you can't have sex.\n\nEdit to clarify since it's been commented below that I am not at all suggesting she or anyone withhold sex ever. That is a form of manipulation and abuse. WHEN YOU HAVE AND INFECTION LIKE A UTI you cannot have sex. It is painful and can make it worse. They can quickly turn into bladder infections. My friend got one from holding pee. She then tried to have sex with the uti and after started peeing blood. Peeing. Blood. Painfully. Took 2 weeks of antibiotics and no sex. Doctors orders. \n\nAnother point on female health- holding pee too long or often overworks the pelvic floor. That can lead to different degrees of prolapse.
