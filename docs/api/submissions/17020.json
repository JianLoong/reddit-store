Everyone calling you an AH is acting like you asked him to actually walk your dog when it seems to me like you only asked him to take your dog out for a few minutes to go potty. You made dinner for your boyfriend AND cleaned up his kitchen, but he can't even take 10 min to help you with your dog?\n\nEdited to add: It's not clear how safe of an area your bf lives in, but it just seems cruel to me for people to call you and AH for feeling unsafe.", "NTA but I couldn\u2019t get past you making dinner and doing the dishes and he couldn\u2019t even do a simple effing favor regardless if he calls himself a dog dad", "NTA - but you should really reconsider your BF.

That's what you should be looking at.  Doesn't matter if it's your dog or his.  He's not helping you (even when you ask), he's not thinking of you or your safety.  You really have to question if you want to be in a relationship with someone who is incapable of meeting you needs for ten minutes!  Ten minutes!  What is the point of being romantically joined with someone who can only think of themselves.   \n\n\nThere are some truly stand up men out there who make considerate and loving partners.

The people saying otherwise don't realize how frightening it can be as a woman to be out at night or the extent to which we're told that if we get raped it's our fault for putting ourselves in that situation. And not all dogs are great deterrents.\n\nAlso, you didn't get the dog while living in that condo - you got it elsewhere and now stay in that condo to be with your bf.

You are literally accommodating him by staying at his condo, cooking a meal in his condo, cleaning up the kitchen in his condo after you cook it, and he cannot even take the dog out for a pee while you are doing those things? You have your own place, where you are comfortable and your dog is comfortable and you both feel safe going out for the bedtime call, so I fail to see what benefit you are getting out this at all. You can cook and clean at home.\n\nSorry to be crude but it seems like you are his uber cook,cleaner and bed warmer and all he has to do is play on his phone.", "NTA.

If so, why stay at Bf's condo?", "I get the point you're making, but I'm the end, that's your dog. It seems like he loves the companionship but not the responsibilities. I think it might make more sense for him to if you lived together. I will say that my husband would always take my dog out even when we first started dating. The longer we were together the more responsibilities he claimed for her. That being said, we used to live in an apartment with a lot of sketchy people in a bad area. It was the only place I could find at the time in price range that allowed German Shepards (ok those were banned so she became a Belgian Shepard on paper\ud83e\udd23).

Why don\u2019t you just go together?", "YTA I\u2019m sorry unless you live in a very dangerous area you should\u2019ve just taken the dog out yourself. He might call himself dad but it\u2019s your dog. If you\u2019re afraid to take him out at 10pm then do it earlier - 10pm is late for a dog to go to sleep anyway.

You expected that a future boyfriend would do it for you?\n\nBoyfriend would be nice to walk him; as a favor. But it\u2019s not his responsibility.\n\nCan you let your dog out earlier?  Is his condo in a high crime area? Condos here are usually nice, and the sidewalks have great lighting, providing a level of safety and community gates.\n\nIf you feel that unsafe in his condo, you should go home with your dog.  To keep you and doggy safe.\n\nThat being said, \u201cshould\u201d he help? I think he should help, since you were making dinner.. But it\u2019s ultimately  not his dog, and not his legal obligation.   You are your dogs legal owner. Do you want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t help you, while you make dinner for both of you? That\u2019s a totally different question, than the one you asked.", "Let me get this straight, if the guy would just stop calling himself the dog's \"dad\", then you'd take responsibility for walking your own dog?  Regardless of bf's claim of paternity, you adopted the dog and you're responsible for it.  It would be nice if your bf would help you.  You might want to go find a bf who \\*will\\* help you.  But, ultimately, you own the dog and you're responsible for its care and well-being.  YTA", "YTA\n\nNot for wishing he would or for thinking he should for your safety, but for *assuming* he feels the same and should just step up without some sort of proper conversation.\n\nSit down together, talk about your future together and the dog, and talk about responsibilities. Instead of doing extra chores in the hopes your bf will get some sort of unrelated hint, *tell him* you don\u2019t feel safe taking the dog out from his condo late at night and you\u2019d like him to take on that responsibility. Be prepared for him to say no, and to make decisions about where you stay and when accordingly.\n\n(Also, if you broke up tomorrow, who\u2019d be keeping the dog?

It's your dog, it's ultimately your responsibility. Why are you incapable of walking him past 10? Do what lady dog owners have been doing for decades, get a bat and some mace. Although depending on how big the dog is, you probably won't even need it.", "INFO: OP, did the place you are living at, which you said you'd return to by \"heading home\", have an enclosed yard? And, if so, do you own it? Or, is it a relative's place that you just happen to live at?", "YTA. Sounds like you don't want to take the dog out at night and you are using his 'dad' talk as a reason to get him to do it. Save the anxious at night excuse. You were willing to run right out that door and go into the night to go home. I guess the night doesn't make you that anxious then.", "ESH, this is your dog and while I understand wanting him to be responsible for that after dark walks that in and of itself is a dramatic reason to \"go home\" whatever you meant that to mean!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
