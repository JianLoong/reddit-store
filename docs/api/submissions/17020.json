Is that you? Let\u2019s go on a walk\u2026the food is doodoo", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend makes now dinner from now on and cleans and you walk the dog during that time.", "NTA. Make sure you get your dog microchipped in your name and keep records of vet bills. I had a friend in a similar situation go through a breakup and the ex boyfriend went behind her back and got HER dog microchipped in his name while she was at work", "NTA, but your BF is. I see relationship red flags all over this one. I say you and your pup deserve better. GTFO of this relationship now, since you don't need this BS especially over something a trivial as this.", "NTA - even if he wasn't calling himself dog dad, when you both spend time together with the dog, you share the duties. My boyfriend has watched his younger sisters dog twice over a weekend, and currently is watching his elder sisters dog over several weeks. I love both dogs, it's obvious I'm not \"mum\" to them, but we will still either both go outside with them (mostly like that with the one that's currently there because it's a bigger dog with much longer walks, while the other one is tiny and would want to go back really quickly) or take turns going outside.\n\nOnly redeeming thing for him would be if he didn't feel comfortable with it - for example I didn't feel comfortable going out with the big dog without a leash because I doubted she would listen to me, and was right because when I tried she just ran back looking for my boyfriend and didn't listen to me. No worries, that happened on a small forest path near the house the dog lives with his sister, so no cars around and the dog knew the area. However doesn't sound like that's the case when he did it no problem the first few times, and he could always just take the dog with a leash.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t know if you even want kids but if you do, don\u2019t have them with this guy.", "Plus it's just the nice thing to do, especially if she gets anxious walking him at night.  Literally every person I've dated in the last 20 years has helped walk or feed my dogs because they realize how important they are to me.  If you love a person with a pet, you need to treat their pet well or they'll dump you fast.", "Agreed NTA. I'm much more of a morning person and doing anything requiring effort in the last hour or so before going to bed; changing bedsheets, hanging laundry etc etc is my idea of hell. \n\nThat being said, I'd always take my dog out to pee if it was dark. My wife just doesn't feel safe. Given newspaper headlines and the huge array of stories pretty much every woman I know has - can't exactly blame her.\n\nMight I grumble a little about it? Yeah. But dog's gotta pee man.", "Yeah, did OP go over to his place, cook for him, and clean up after while he sat on his phone? \n\nIf she hadn't done anything, I would say they should both take the dog out since it's late but. Really? He's already just letting her cater to him and not giving back. I don't see him getting better.", "Yep NTA... and it kinda makes you wonder whether there are other red flags that OP might be ignoring or not seeing?", "Absolutely.  I have a feeling this goes beyond taking the dog out. I wonder what would happen if OP said , \"OK, you do the clearing up while I take the dog out.\" Would he find excuses for that too? He sounds like a lazy git who wants all the fun and none of the work.", "He'll be just the same selfish shirker while calling himself Dad to human babies. This attitude rarely gets better. Be warned.", "NTA. Doesn't seem like you were asking a lot.", "Swap tasks? He did nothing, what on earth would he have to \"swap\" for walking the dog?", "What does the location have to do with anything? She still did all of the practical tasks that evening, he would still be calling the dog \"his dog\" while doing absolutely frick all to take care of it.", "You wouldn't want to help your own partner when he/she cooked both of you dinner and then cleaned kitchen? You would be more comfortable to let your partner do that while you lay on coach with your bloated belly filled with food since it is your place, huh?  \n\nIt sounds to me that OP has bf problem and not dog one.", "I doubt this should be taken at face value. It feels like OP is unhappy that she is busy cooking meal and cleaning after it while her bf refuses to help her out with walking her dog, especially when he likes a dog a lot. \n\n\"Your dog, your responsability\" remark is rather childish in this setting. They simply have unhealthy dynamics.", "I'm an aunt to a doggo and I also do that!\n\n\nI'm even allergic to dogs but I still do it because I love them and to help out.", "NTA he isn't the dog parent at all here.", "Yeah if he can\u2019t walk a dog once a day, I hate to see the division of labor on late night feedings, diapers or taking care of a sick kid.", "Most dogs need to be let out before their people sleep, which is usually late at night. It's very unhealthy for them to wait too long between bathroom breaks, just like it is for humans.\n\nAnd it sounds like OP had a yard (or still has a yard?) when she got her puppy.", "Yeah but at least he would have moved his ass off the couch and come to her place. I'm betting she shopped for ingredients, cooked, served & cleaned up after that meal. She probably even boxed him the leftovers for tomorrow, all while he sat on his ass.", "I definitely would but she never communicated to him it\u2019s a quid pro quo thing. And she also didn\u2019t mention how he generally helps with stuff so we can draw no conclusion. She is actually being somewhat manipulative. Without open communicating, she takes on more of a certain task and at the same time wants to push a task on him she doesn\u2019t want to do herself.\n\nSometimes my partner just feels like cooking and I let him. Doesn\u2019t mean I never help, not at all. But I would be very disappointed if he did  that only to get me to do something for him that he tries to get around himself without openly telling me that this is his plan. OP wants to force things to be her way without considering her partner\u2019s side because it\u2019s more convenient to her and that\u2019s the bottom line of this story.", "I do not understand where do you see a quid pro quo thing. And if you see a manipulation in this scenario, you clearly live by quid pro quo scenario yourself.", "That's the point. He doesn't want to believe it is \"her dog.\" He keeps saying the dog is \"his dog too,\" despite not doing anything to meet the dog's needs. He's being an asshole.", "People these days. They see 2 words, butt their heads into it and do not see anything around it.", "In her second paragraph she clearly says she cooks and cleans so he could return the favor. We are not looking at the same text apparently.", "She had the dog before she met him. It's her dog if they break up, right? Or does he get it? Her dog. Her problem.", "I believe this is where you are seeing it wrong. OP is saying that she asked for a favor becouse she helped out with some errands and not that she is only doing errands so she could ask for a favor.", "It is LEGALLY her dog, but this isn't about legality, it's about decency. If he is going to insist on calling it \"their\" dog, he could at least accept a little responsibility, especially since OP is cooking dinner and cleaning for him. No, she isn't OWED anything, but it's still an asshole move to refuse to help out with the dog you claim is your child.", "So he gets to keep it? Sounds fair if he keeps. If it was a child, he would get to keep it?", "Okay so you read nothing I just said. I have no idea what you're talking about and I don't really care enough to figure it out. Have a good one \ud83d\udc4d", "Whole point is she wanted a dog so she got one. She needs to care for the dog. Forget about what he says about the dog. It is her dog. It is her responsibility. Simple as that. She needs to walk her dog. Everyone is stuck on what he says instead of what she is not doing.", "Yes, the dog is her responsibility, but you're acting like people aren't allowed to ask for favors. Obviously she's going to walk the dog if her boyfriend refuses, but it would be NICE of him to walk the dog as a favor, considering all she seems to do for him. Not everything is so black and white.  But clearly neither of us are going to change out minds so let's just agree to disagree."]}
