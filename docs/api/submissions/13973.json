She's favoring one child by supporting an expensive diet when it isn't necessary (replacement meat isn't necessary).  You're just trying to balance the scales.  \n\nI think you worded it poorly.  Maria doesn't \"have to stop being vegan\" she just needs to use the cheaper vegan options so there is enough money left for food for the other kids.", "NTA. Good on you for sending anything. Keep in contact with the 3 younger ones, and let them know you'll have their backs, but you are not obligated to fund your sisters life, and nieces choices.", "Sounds like sis needs to have a talk with her daughter about switching to the more cost effective plant based dishes so she can continue eating vegan. Not to sound heartless but it's your sisters responsibility to make sure all 4 of her kids are fed and taken care of so NTA I say.", "NTA Maria is 16 yo. She can get a part time job if she wants to eat expensive food different from the rest of the family. Her choice to be vegetarian does not trump having enough food for the other kids.  You are supplementing all of their groceries. Rice & beans are a good cheap vegetarian option that provides all the amino acids found in meat. If they are struggling to get enough to eat one person doesn\u2019t not get more of the food budget that the others.", "Info: you say in comments that Maria gloats that her mom buys her expensive vegan food she likes and her siblings get less than. what does your sister do about this behavior?", "NTA\n\nIf your sister wants to fund a special diet for one of the children she can do that on her own, while you continue to assist with the food you and your household normally prepare.", "NTA. As you say, there are other vegan friendly options, your niece could choose, but she doesn\u2019t want those. And that\u2019s fine and the situation or money is not a factor or there isn\u2019t other children who are paying the price for what she wants. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong. The only thing I would say is instead of demanding your niece not be vegan you should be demanding she eat the vegan friendly food you say your country has that she has refused to consider before.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to bail out your sister for her bad life choices. It\u2019s disheartening to see how she favors one child over the others. It\u2019s very noble that you want to help them eat a decent meal as often as possible. The fact that she gets mad at you for not giving her money shows just how ungrateful and entitled she is. I would not give her another cent; she doesn\u2019t deserve it if she wastes it on expensive food for only one family member to enjoy. If you want any charitable involvement with her family, just sending food is fine.", "NTA.  Your entitled to spend your money however you want. You are also entitled to put stipulations on any money or help you decide to give. Your sister can choose to turned down your help if she doesn't agree with the stipulations.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with your niece being vegan  there is however something extremely wrong with your sister allowing her other children to go malnourished to accommodate her oldest dietary preferences.", "NTA but I think your approach is wrong. The issue isn\u2019t that she\u2019s vegan, it\u2019s that she\u2019s picky. As you say she could be vegan without going for the Beyond burgers and VioLife products. It\u2019s easy and I know this firsthand because I\u2019m vegan and rarely eat that shit. \n\nIf being vegan is more than just a trend for her she\u2019ll take it seriously and scale down to the cheaper vegan options.

You are helping to offset that sacrifice by providing food.  And I understand why you don't want to send money, chances are your sister will spend it on Maria's food instead of food for the rest of the family.", "NTA. If you're supporting her, you have the right to set the reasonable boundary that all the kids benefit. It is not your responsibility to provide vegan food - its a choice not an allergy. If mom wants to provide that, she needs to get a better job to pay for it. Your sister sounds manipulative.", " NTA, she\u2019s prioritizing feeding one child over three others. She should not be spending extra money that she doesn\u2019t have, to support her child\u2019s desires when it means others go hungry. You\u2019re absolutely correct to send the kids meals, but not send her money.", "I dont get why Maria has to get expensive food because she is vegan. You need to supplement b12 but you definitly do not need vegan milk or vegan meat replacement products which are expensive. You can eat of oil, vegetables and rice/pasta/potatoes etc. This does not sound to expensive to me and your niece does not have to give up being vegan.

Disowning their own daughter is cruel.", "INFO: why don't you send vegan friendly meals? It makes much more sense to offer more practical alternatives than demand she change her diet? Things like rice and beans, daal, veggie soups are easy and cheap.\n\nYou can send meat on the side or everyone can eat vegan a few meals a week. \n\nThe problem isn't her veganism, it's her entitlement and her mother's enabling. You only sending meat based meals turns it into some sort of moral thing for her to stick to her current diet.", "INFO: If plant-based dishes are common in your  culture, why not send those sometimes?", "Nta, good for you for stepping up and being responsible.

So why won't she eat them (the niece)? Most vegans don't eat vegan meat on the daily but plant based mostly", "NTA.\n\nVegan diet can be really expensive in some countries. It is a diet someone should choose when they have the money to do that and not at the expense of others.

So you help where it is needed the most.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Can Maria start working to pay for her own expensive food items?", "YTA, but gently. Based on what you\u2019re saying, Maria being vegan is not the issue; it\u2019s that your sister chooses to spend most of her food budget on Maria, thereby mostly neglecting her other kids. If that\u2019s correct, then stopping Maria from being vegan is not the answer. Your sister needs to plan her food budget better and inform Maria that while she can continue to eat vegan, she will not be provided anything that does not fit within the budget. You said there\u2019s no pound-for-pound equivalent to meat products in your country, but you also said \u201cwe have many plant-based dishes that are absolutely vegan friendly.\u201d So, Maria can still eat vegan without the special, expensive stuff being bought for her. And at 16, even if she\u2019s not old enough to get a job in your country, she\u2019s certainly old enough to cook her own meals. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to provide assistance if you don\u2019t want to, and both your sister and Maria need a stern reality check, but Maria doesn\u2019t need to stop being vegan to accomplish that.", "ESH\n\nNot that you're *required* to send your sister food or money, but to refuse to help unless Maria \"stops being vegan\" is kind of ass-holy.\n\nAnd your sister is an asshole for spoiling Maria. She should tell Maria that while it's fine to be vegan, she won't buy her special vegan fake food that the family can't afford. Maria can eat plant-based dishes with lots of grains and legumes for protein.", "ESH. You are simply the AH in this situation for trying to force Maria to stop being vegan. This is not needed. Just having her eat cheaper options is enough.\n\nMaria is old enough to know that her demands is causing her own siblings to go hungry which is selfish and disgusting. If she can eat less expensive vegan food, then that is what she should eat. She should get a job if she wants the expensive products.\n\nYour sister however...is even worse than disgusting. She is spoiling one child and causing the others to go hungry!?! Can your parents take care of these kids instead?", "ESH. Your sister for being a choosy beggar, you for insinuating that your niece is spoiled because she follows a certain diet and only giving support when people follow your rules. That\u2019s not help. \n\nLet me be clear, you don\u2019t have any obligation to support your sister and her kids financially or with food. But dangling it over her head and saying \u201cdo what I say or no help\u201d is an AH thing to do. \n\nEither you are able and willing to help so you do, or you are unable or unwilling to help so you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to weaponize \u201chelp\u201d to get her to behave how you want.", "ESH \n\nI understand your sister is in a tight financial spot trying to provide for 4 kids, one of which has a dietary restriction. But, she can't be sacrificing the nutritional needs of her 3 other kids to appease the dietary choices of 1. If Maria wants to be vegan, that's her choice. But, she can't expect her already financially tight mother to be spending 3x the normal food costs for her at the expense of her siblings. And the mother needs to stop enabling that. I'm not sure what country you're in, but I'd wager 16 is old enough to get a part-time job after school or weekends. She needs to fund her own diet.\n\nAs for you OP, you're not TA for not wanting to financially support your sister.

If she is really invested in her veganism, which if she\u2019s been strict for two years it sounds like she is, then it probably is very important to her. Is veganism more expensive? Yeah, but healthy foods are more expensive in general than non-healthy foods. \n\nYou say you have perfectly acceptable vegan friendly dishes you COULD send them, but you send meat dishes that your niece can\u2019t eat. You stopped sending financial aid explicitly because she buys vegan meats. So you are punishing your niece for being vegan. That\u2019s an asshole move. Either you help the whole family or you don\u2019t.\n\nEdit after info added: I stand by my judgement. You could help them buy vegan friendly groceries, almond or soy milk or whatever, but you don\u2019t.

You don't need to give your sister money for any reason, but telling her that you're stopping until Maria stops being vegan is an asshole move. Your sister is an asshole for obvious reasons, but do keep in mind she's probably coming from a place of \"Maria isn't willing to eat xyz and I don't want her to NOT EAT.\" Whether that's reasonable is something that I can't judge and OP can't judge as someone at this distance from Maria. Is she at a point where she would rather not eat than eat animals? Is she the type of teenager right now who would stop eating to express control over her own food intake if her mom tries to control her diet to the extent OP expects? We don't know that. I don't think OP is in a position to know that. Doesn't mean she needs to give her sister money, but I do advise OP: have more empathy and understanding here, your sister may have concerns here that you're not aware of.", "In the end, what you do with your money is your choice, but YTA just because you seem to have an attitude about the kid wanting to be vegan. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being vegan, she just needs to learn how to go about it a manageable way.    \n\nWhy not help by sending some inexpensive meatless food over or some of those inexpensive plant-based dishes you have already mentioned, so the child learns how to be vegan on a budget?", "ESH.

But it sounds like she is old enough to get a part time job to afford the items she *prefers.* It's awesome that you're helping out, but it sounds like a reaction of disapproval to send nothing for her at all.", "Your niece as the right to be a vegan is she chooses.  The dynamic between her and her mother who wants to support her life choices is between them.\n\nGiving your sister and niece an ultimatium like that is definatively an AH move - deciding to hold them to ransom until they conform to what you want.

Is this a family trait you've picked up from your parents - disowning them if they don't conform?", "YTA - You don't need to spend extra money to be a vegan; only if you buy expensive pre-made vegan foods, which aren't great for you, anyway.

She could of course be buying especially expensive items, but if it\u2019s tofu, veggie burgers, or veggie sausages etc it\u2019s almost always equivalent or cheaper. \n\nRegardless, the main issue is you sending food you *know* your niece won\u2019t eat. You say yourself that there are plenty of plant based foods she can eat - why won\u2019t you send any of those?

You\u2019re acting out towards a teenager, you realize? You can decide what to do with your own money of course but you\u2019re causing drama unnecessarily and hurting your niece.

Why would you send food to a child who doesn't want it, while there are 2 other children starving because of her choice?", "Yeah me too, we\u2019re pretty fucked over here atm lmao", "[deleted]", "You don't need sugar! You do need oil and salt, though. The easiest method is to use salted roast peanuts, then add just enough oil that it blends properly.", "Ok. Although from how your sister acts she will probably kick out Liam the day he reaches 18.", " I mean in general, for example your apples - there\u2019s a chemical in it which stops it from turning brown \n\nA lot of American food is banned in the EU", "OP clearly doesn't care about what the niece will eat, not are they obligated to. It just seems petty to not send commonly consumed plant foods to the rest of the family. \n\nThe rest of the family clearly can eat plants, right?", "Peanuts are not uncommon outside the US!", "We're kind expecting it.", "If 3 of the 4 aren\u2019t vegans why would OP send plant based food, the vegan won\u2019t eat, to his niece and nephews who prefer meat? \n\nOP said the vegan won\u2019t eat basic vegan food but wants specific, specialty, expensive vegan food, how would sending plant based options help if she won\u2019t eat them anyway?", "Let me guess, you're vegan...", "Just did a quick Google and you're right I deleted my comment\n\nUS is #4 globally for peanut consumption tho, after China India Nigeria (the countries with the biggest population booms, coincidence? I think not!)", "It really varies in where you are in the world. I mean there's a lot of things that are common in other countries that you can't really find in the United States unless you go to a specialty grocer and then you pay a lot for it.", "\"Outside the US\" isn't one country \ud83d\ude09 it's very possible that they're available some places and not others.", "I think you are doing the right thing. Chanel the money into food or put it into savings for when the kids turn 18. Sounds like you are keeping your eye on the overall situation and will step in for the kids if things go south.", "OP says their culture has many vegan-friendly dishes, so sending meat only is a deliberate choice.\n\nOP wasn't asking about catering to this person's particular tastes, their requirement is that they stop being vegan. This seems like an over-reaction.", "How do you know someone's not vegan? They'll tell you.", "OP specifically says \u201cHowever we have many plant based dishes that are absolutely vegan friendly. But my niece won\u2019t eat them.\u201d  \n\nThe kids want meat. If OP can afford to send them meat why should OP only send vegan friendly options that the kids OP is sending the meals for don\u2019t particularly want. \n\nIt\u2019s a deliberate choice because OP is the only one who seems to care about the opinions of the 3 other kids. If they want meat, they should be able to have meat, instead of settling for plant based meals."]}
