Not to sound heartless but it's your sisters responsibility to make sure all 4 of her kids are fed and taken care of so NTA I say.", "NTA Maria is 16 yo. She can get a part time job if she wants to eat expensive food different from the rest of the family. Her choice to be vegetarian does not trump having enough food for the other kids.  You are supplementing all of their groceries. Rice & beans are a good cheap vegetarian option that provides all the amino acids found in meat. If they are struggling to get enough to eat one person doesn\u2019t not get more of the food budget that the others.", "Info: you say in comments that Maria gloats that her mom buys her expensive vegan food she likes and her siblings get less than. what does your sister do about this behavior?", "NTA\n\nIf your sister wants to fund a special diet for one of the children she can do that on her own, while you continue to assist with the food you and your household normally prepare.", "NTA. As you say, there are other vegan friendly options, your niece could choose, but she doesn\u2019t want those. And that\u2019s a fine situation if money is not a factor or there isn\u2019t other children who are paying the price for what she wants. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong. The only thing I would say is instead of demanding your niece not be vegan you should be demanding she eat the vegan friendly food you say your country has that she has refused to consider before.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to bail out your sister for her bad life choices. It\u2019s disheartening to see how she favors one child over the others. It\u2019s very noble that you want to help them eat a decent meal as often as possible. The fact that she gets mad at you for not giving her money shows just how ungrateful and entitled she is.

It\u2019s easy and I know this firsthand because I\u2019m vegan and rarely eat that shit. \n\nIf being vegan is more than just a trend for her she\u2019ll take it seriously and scale down to the cheaper vegan options.

If you're supporting her, you have the right to set the reasonable boundary that all the kids benefit. It is not your responsibility to provide vegan food - its a choice not an allergy. If mom wants to provide that, she needs to get a better job to pay for it. Your sister sounds manipulative.", " NTA, she\u2019s prioritizing feeding one child over three others.

You need to supplement b12 but you definitly do not need vegan milk or vegan meat replacement products which are expensive.

Based on what you\u2019re saying, Maria being vegan is not the issue; it\u2019s that your sister chooses to spend most of her food budget on Maria, thereby mostly neglecting her other kids. If that\u2019s correct, then stopping Maria from being vegan is not the answer. Your sister needs to plan her food budget better and inform Maria that while she can continue to eat vegan, she will not be provided anything that does not fit within the budget. You said there\u2019s no pound-for-pound equivalent to meat products in your country, but you also said \u201cwe have many plant-based dishes that are absolutely vegan friendly.\u201d So, Maria can still eat vegan without the special, expensive stuff being bought for her.

Maria can eat plant-based dishes with lots of grains and legumes for protein.", "ESH. You are simply the AH in this situation for trying to force Maria to stop being vegan. This is not needed. Just having her eat cheaper options is enough.\n\nMaria is old enough to know that her demands is causing her own siblings to go hungry which is selfish and disgusting. If she can eat less expensive vegan food, then that is what she should eat. She should get a job if she wants the expensive products.\n\nYour sister however...is even worse than disgusting.

If she is really invested in her veganism, which if she\u2019s been strict for two years it sounds like she is, then it probably is very important to her. Is veganism more expensive? Yeah, but healthy foods are more expensive in general than non-healthy foods. \n\nYou say you have perfectly acceptable vegan friendly dishes you COULD send them, but you send meat dishes that your niece can\u2019t eat. You stopped sending financial aid explicitly because she buys vegan meats. So you are punishing your niece for being vegan. That\u2019s an asshole move. Either you help the whole family or you don\u2019t.\n\nEdit after info added: I stand by my judgement.

You don't need to give your sister money for any reason, but telling her that you're stopping until Maria stops being vegan is an asshole move. Your sister is an asshole for obvious reasons, but do keep in mind she's probably coming from a place of \"Maria isn't willing to eat xyz and I don't want her to NOT EAT.\" Whether that's reasonable is something that I can't judge and OP can't judge as someone at this distance from Maria. Is she at a point where she would rather not eat than eat animals? Is she the type of teenager right now who would stop eating to express control over her own food intake if her mom tries to control her diet to the extent OP expects? We don't know that. I don't think OP is in a position to know that. Doesn't mean she needs to give her sister money, but I do advise OP: have more empathy and understanding here, your sister may have concerns here that you're not aware of.", "In the end, what you do with your money is your choice, but YTA just because you seem to have an attitude about the kid wanting to be vegan. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being vegan, she just needs to learn how to go about it a manageable way.    \n\nWhy not help by sending some inexpensive meatless food over or some of those inexpensive plant-based dishes you have already mentioned, so the child learns how to be vegan on a budget?", "ESH.
