Also, I called Uncle (cousin's dad). Uncle wasn't at the event and has been rather silent in this matter. I learned that cousin hasn't shared that A) nobody shared allergy issues and B) that we paid the initial copay. Uncle is now upset. I have been told not to worry my pretty little head and he will have a chat with his son. \n\nIf anybody needs me, I'll be sitting at my desk doing my best Mr. Burns imitation. \n\nUPDATE 2: Uncle just texted me with the following: \"I called my son and told him he needs to leave you alone and take responsibility for his mistakes. Then I called his mother and told her she needs to get a handle on that namby-pamby boy of hers. Don't you worry about a thing.\" I have to admit, y'all, I'm DYING. Thank you everyone for validating my gut reaction. I have a tendency to overthink and often feel guilty about things I shouldn't. You're all very kind!

It's a fun event because I get to see family I generally don't see the rest of the year and I love hosting. It is semi-potluck and I make a point of asking about allergies and food preferences.\n\nThis year my cousin(36M) told me he was joining with his new wife (they got married in July) and her daughter, who is around 8. Cousin was added to the group chat and didn't say anything about allergies/preferences when asked.\n\nForward to Thanksgiving. One of the desserts I made was peanut butter cookies. My family and I love them. Cousin's SD ate one and is allergic to peanuts. I had no idea and would never have made them if I knew. Husband and I took them to a stand alone ER that was about 5 minutes from the house. We stayed with them for some time until she was transferred to the local hospital where she stayed overnight. She ended up being fine.\n\nLast week I got a text from cousin with a pic of the hospital bill. He wanted to know how I wanted to handle it. I called and he and wife expect us to pay the bill. I told him we weren't going to do that. I reminded him that he had told me nobody had allergies, and hubby and I did pay the copay at the ER ($500) because we felt bad. He had an argument and now the family is involved. They're mostly on my side but some are getting into me for having anything peanut related cause \"everybody\" has peanut allergies nowadays.\n\nThe bill is about $6k. We don't have it. The $500 we paid came out of our Christmas budget. I feel bad his SD got sick. Ultimately tho it's their responsibility to handle things like this.

Peanut allergies are common but you can\u2019t expect the world to just give up peanut. \n\nMy 5 year old knows how to ask if foods have peanuts before eating.  We\u2019ve also been showing up to parties with a desert in hand for our child because 99 times out of 100 the desert/treats are not peanut safe.  Very rarely does someone go out of their way to be peanut safe without being told in advance. \n\nFor the 8-year old not to ask/know, or the parents to not mention it or inquire is a bit puzzling.

Or I'd at least ask before blindly eating cookies that multiple family members already know are peanut butter, ones that probably smelled very obviously like it too.", "This can't be real.\n\nIf it is, NTA at all.

Thanksgiving...  That was 15-16 days ago.\n\nI used to work in billing.  The fastest we could get a bill adjudicated by insurance was 17 days after we dropped the completed claim into the queue.  Before we could drop the bill into the insurance queue, we had to get codes applied, reports dictated and filed, and signatures. That would take several days.  Maybe their EMR system is more efficient.  That included amounts applied to the deductible.\n\nThen there was the lag from when the insurance determined the amount that was due from the patient and the bills went out to the patient. (Patient bills are run on a set cycle.  On the day the bills with that last name ran, the system would send a bill for any account with a patient balance.  If your last name went out the day before the insurance cleared, you didn't get a bill for a month.)  Then you had the time it took to mail the bill to the patient.  Now, they could have printed the bill off the portal, ok, but, still, Is the $5K the total amount that was sent to the insurance carrier, or the amount that was actually due from the patient?\n\n*That's a whole lot of technical gobbledegook for are they showing you the Itemized statement - which actually means nothing unless you are private pay, and even then is negotiable - or are they showing you the actual patient due?  The $500 copay was definitely due at the time of service, though.  I would have several questions to see if cousin wasn't pulling something.*\n\nAs far as actually having peanut butter cookies in the first place, you didn't know.  Not everyone has allergies.  We don't do peanut butter cookies at my house, but we do reeses, and I buy my peanut butter in Costco quantities.  You need to warn me if you are allergic, or you are SOL.  So, N T A on the cookies.  You asked.  They didn't tell you.\n\nETA - Changed raw bill to itemized statement.", "This person came to your house, gobbled up your food, then ate a mystery cookie while suffering from a serious peanut allergy. And didn't inform you of their allergies. Also why is the bill so high if they have insurance? That $500 copay you gave them was more than generous.

For those that feel that I was in the wrong and we should be held accountable, for something we had no control over, I am sure cousin would be willing to take donations from you all.

If you can legally be held responsible, perhaps your homeowners insurance will cover it.", "Yep, every time he asks, send him back a screenshot of the part of the conversation where you asked if anyone had allergies, and his response (or lack of)", "Actually they could be.

She is one of the most independent, mature kids I know (age 15 now).  Her last allergic reaction was at age 10.  It was only after that time that she started taking more responsibility for her allergies.\n\nI think there were a few factors involved.  It wasn't until she was 8/9 that she really started going places without me, and usually I would be the one to check for nuts.  She knew about her allergy, but she'd never really had to do much about it. \n\nPeanuts have a strong smell, but has she been exposed to that smell much?  We jokingly talk about the 'poison club' of people who have inadvertently fed my daughter nuts, and in each case, she was given something to eat and did not realise it had nuts in it.  The last time, it was a cashew dip.  Because of her allergy, we'd never had nut dips in the house and she didn't realise there were such things.\n\nIf my daughter, who as I said, has always been incredibly mature and independent, wasn't ready to take charge of her allergy until age 10, then I'll give an 8 year old a pass.  Yes, my daughter did know about her allergy, and knew she couldn't have nuts.  But the whole being responsible herself thing didn't quite kick in until the last reaction at age 10.  Then it was like she clicked and went \"ohhhhh\" and that was it.  Perfectly responsible from then on.\n\nOn the other hand, tree nuts are a different beast to peanuts.  Tree nuts aren't as common, so we simply didn't have them in our house, she wasn't likely as a young child to encounter them often, and so the allergy just wasn't a constant presence in our minds.  Peanuts, on the other hand, are much more common, especially in the US where peanuts seem to be in nearly everything (still can't wrap my head around a peanut cake.  What IS that?).

And, the $500 copay was definitely due when they walked in the door.  That's part of the contract between the insurance carrier and the hospital.\n\nNow, the $5K part.\n\nThink about your credit card.  The statement closes on, say, the 5th.  All of the charges and payments that happened between the last closing and this one are on the bill.  The same happens for the hospital.  So, the charges for that ER visit and stay would have appeared on the bill.  \n\n*But,* the total amount of the hospital charges means nothing until the insurance pays the claim.  That is because the insurance company and the hospital have a contract between them that states how much the hospital is allowed to charge for a certain service.  (The hospital billed $12K for my kidney stone removal this year, but wrote off $5K due to the contract.) *But*, for a hospital bill, the insurance is also paying on that bill, not just the patient.  And, the insurance pays first.    \n\nIn the contract between the insurance carrier and the hospital, the patient is not liable for anything except that copay until the insurance pays.  Once the insurance pays, you will see lines on the bill that say something like \"Ins payment - $x.xx\", \"Ins or contractual adjustment - $x.xx\", \"Applied to deductible - $x.xx\", \"Applied to co-insurance - $x.xx\", \"Due from patient - $x.xx\".  Cousin owes the deductible, co-insurance, and patient balance due.  The co-pay was already paid.  Co-pay is due when you walk in the door.  Co-insurance is the percentage of the bill you owe if you have say an 80/20 plan.  The 20% is called co-insurance.  \n\nMy \"INFO\" question is that there is a process for the hospital to get their bill to the carrier.  The more human intervention needed, the longer the process is.  There would have been people off for the holidays.  Then the carrier has to pay their part.  And, they have a set amount of time to pay that is in their contract to pay what is called a \"clean claim\".  And human intervention on their part adds to the time it takes.  And the carrier would have had people off for the holidays.  Medicare at one time was 14 days.  I never saw a commercial carrier pay in less time.  \n\nAll that to say that in my experience, it would take 25-30 days at the minimum to come up with the amount the patient actually owes.  \n\nNow, it is possible that Cousin saw the bill that had the total amount before insurance, freaked, and didn't realize that the carrier hadn't paid.  I know I have to take a deep breath before I open medical bills.  \n\nI still say that it's not your bill because cousin didn't warn you about the allergy.  You were quite generous to pay the $500. \n\nFWIW, if it *were* \"your fault\" it would probably be covered under your homeowners' policy.  You would have to pay a deductible to the homeowners' plan, and your rates would go up, but, keep this in mind if he decides to sue.

It occurred to them that they have money.  I would bet folding money that the cousin doesn't care about fair at all. He just wants the money.  \n\nAlso, just because there is a hospital bill doesn't mean that insurance isn't paying some or all of it.", "Good suggestions for the allium allergy, thank you!", "yep, OP need to screenshot the message thread and save it before the cousin deletes it", "Of course, but I was under the assumption that it was a stepfather. Not that it absolves him of responsibility but depending on length of time he's dealt with it, I would think mom would be the more ultra cautious.", "That had not occurred to me but you may be right. \n\nIf the cousin didn't know she had this allergy that means the mother is unfit. I'm very sympathetic to unexpected $6k medical bills (for a single day of care!!) but...\n\nI wonder if they even carry an epi-pen with them.", "A friend of my daughter's can't eat anything with onion in it, but she's just fine if you use onion powder. \n\nSomething in the oils or something.", "It's still better for the person suffering an allergy attack to keep problems at bay until they reach the hospital.", "I had wondered about the severity of her allergy. And, I get that kids are sneaky and typically want what they can't have. In the end, mom was responsible for the safety of her child. It's absurd to expect the hosts to pay the medical bills.", "Same.  My son is allergic to peanuts. By 4 or 5 he knew to ask if someone offered him food other than me.  He even asked his siblings before he ate stuff.  By 8 he could indentify most food with peanuts our peanut butter by smell. He also knew to come ask me or his dad about food at someone else's house before he ate it. I also kept a close eye on him when eating at potlucks buffets and someone else's house.  This is on the mother in my opinion. Why is she not teaching her daughter to watch for harmful food? This is just as important to teach as potty training and walking in my opinion.  Cousin is definitely YTA", "Remembering potlucks from the past when I'd bring a basic dessert (cream cheese pie), the younger children would ask about all of the ingredients before taking a serving.\n\nStill, the cousin should have had the common sense to say, 'yes, my stepdaughter is allergic to-.'\n\n100% on him for this.", "I had a child with food allergies, he\u2019s now a young adult.  The moment we learned he had allergies, at age 18 months I made a point to protect him.  Because I was his parent.  Your cousin really might want to consider learning to be one.\n\nYTA", "How does this make me TA? I'm confused.", "I can't have caffeine due to kidney issues, and by 8 I was very aware and knew what kinds of pop etc I could and couldn't drink and told people as needed (ex. \"can I have a glass of water please?\" if the only pop provided had caffeine). 8 is old enough to be taking at least some responsibility for her allergy", "So he is putting all the blame on you in order to save his marriage? Does his wife know he did not tell you?", "Ugh, A thousand apologies, it\u2019s early morning here and I\u2019m only about 3 sips down on my tea.  Clearly, you are NOT the asshole.  I plead Dumb Ass.", "This right here. NTA. If he didn\u2019t even know she had an allergy, there\u2019s no way he can expect OP to know \u2014 and to foot the full bill for the medical costs associated. To me, expecting someone else to shoulder the consequences of your ignorance and lack of communication within your immediate family is bold as brass. If it was my SD, I\u2019d be apologizing profusely to her for not looking out for her and to everyone else involved for the scare \u2014 not trying to pawn off my responsibility on everyone else.", "Here's what's scary now. There's text messages I don't get in group settings and the why can be very perplexing. Also NOW you can delete text messages from existence. NTL YES screen shot those exchanges with the date and time.", "Also...why didn't they have an epi pen?", "I'm cackling at the update. Of course the cousin didn't tell anyone he neglected to inform OP about SD's allergies. That's always how it goes!", "NTA. OP, screenshot where the cousin said no one had any allergies. I would respond to every text with a picture of it and say, \"If he didn't know she had any allergies, why would I?\" I would respond to the cousin with the screenshot, \"You made a mistake. I know it's hard, but that doesn't make it our responsibility.\"", "That would mean paying OP back for fronting the cost of the copay ($500).  The cousin saw an opportunity to get cash and tried to pull a fast one over OP.  The balance owed had already been taken care of by OP and her husband.  \n\nWhat a dirtbag.  And NTA.", "So much this. By 8yo my kid could smell peanuts in something the second he got close and long before that he learned to always ask and read labels. This is a parenting problem not a host problem.", "8 isn't even a little kid. 8 is definitely old enough to know to ask before you eat something, especially when you have a life threatening allergy. My 2yo can do it", "Uncle hasn't called me back, but I'm waiting with anticipation. He's a retired career Army veteran with an exceedingly low tolerance for bullshit. He's also doted on both myself and the one other niece he has since we were born, basically.", "And not teaching the child to ask about what's in everything she puts into her mouth is not helping her at all. She needs some power in her relationship to foods. They should be giving her the ability to read labels and question all new foods so she has some empowerment over her allergies. She can't be completely responsible for herself. But, they can start giving her tools to help her manage herself and not feel so victimized by this thing she can't stop.", "This. I definitely think there is a high probability that cousin didn't remember to tell OP about stepdaughter's allergy but told his new wife he did. So now it is all about CYA for him.", "From what I understand you still need to visit an ER immediately even if you use an epi pen, they aren't a replacement for getting medical attention, they just slow it enough to allow for intervention. \n\nI may be misremembering, but I was surprised when I read it because I was under the assumption that using an epi pen was sufficient", "NEVER NEVER NEVER pay the direct bill from any Healthcare Provider (hospital, ambulance, MDs, labs)!  I used to work for a US Healthcare Company a while ago & always tell folks this.\n\nAs r/Working-on-it12 explained in detail, these Providers have specific contracts with Healthcare Insurance Carriers.  All bills should go through the Bill Review system of your Cousin\u2019s insurance BEFORE you pay anymore than the Deductible (which is \u201c1st dollar\u201d due).  Your Cousin should get an EOB (Explanation of Benefits) from Insurance, which will show what they paid & what Cousin still owes.\n\nEven \u201cOut of Network \u201c bills, usually labs, diagnostics & ambulance can be negotiated because no one had a chance to ask for \u201cin network\u201d Providers.\n\n\u2026& as e/tamtheprogram said, it is INCREDIBLY TYPICAL for Providers to send out bills BEFORE the Insurance pays, just to get an Overpayment (& boy, what a fight to get that money back!)\n\nNTA-It was generous of you to pay the deductible.  The rest is on, frankly, your Cousin\u2019s Wife.", "Do keep us updated, please! We love a good comeuppance.", "In these times of homeowners' insurance being canceled left and right with or without a claim history. Why would anyone want to make a claim on their insurance just because BIL and wife were negligent nor do they have health insurance?", "I was scrolling down looking for this point. \n\nIt is vital that OP pull out their homeowner's ins. and look at their policy. Call the agent. This may well be a case where OP's ins. will make the cousin whole.", "My husband has celiac and extreme social anxiety. Being the bitch who asks what\u2019s in the food is my job (that I assigned myself because I love him).", "Does cousin not have health insurance?", "I wouldn't have paid the 500, not your child to monitor or problem, parents where present.  They are neglectful", "Your answer is so complete, it should be on personal finance for all the medical billing questions that get posted there! \n\nThis is an excellent explanation for people that haven't dealt with medical bills very often - and also, if it's a big bill with lots of lines, check them! I just knocked a couple hundred off a recent bill because they charged for oxygen... When the person in the hospital never received any! Billing folks are usually really helpful if you approach them with politeness and willingness to work with them, so don't be afraid to call them with questions with your own bill, of course!", "Ding ding ding!", "my 6 year old too. she knows exactly which nuts trigger her and wont eat anything if she doesn't know whats in it. and i make sure i tell everyone what she cant and can eat. but i would never blame anyone who didn't remember. thats mine and my daughters job.", "I work with children with special needs and many have allergies. Even young children with autism or other learning disabilities know what foods they are allergic to and they are careful to avoid them. \nMy daughter had a friend over when she was 4 years old, who was allergic to dairy. He made sure everyone washed their hands if they touched anything containing dairy, like cookies or cheese.", "NTA. And did your pb cookies have the International PB Symbol of crossed fork marks? Or the sign of a Hersheys Kiss in the center for a Peanut Blossom? Anyhow, even if not, pb cookies often taste like pb. That's the point. It's not like gluten, or dairy, which can be hidden. \n\nPlus, you asked. He failed. His problem. His bill for stupidity", "You didn't even need to pay the co-pay.", "NTA- Your cousin is solely responsible for his SD's medical bills after not disclosing the allergy when you asked. You handling the ER co-pay is more than enough in this situation!", "NTA. Also, who in the world has a peanut allergy and doesn't ask what's in a cookie? Also 90% of the time you can SMELL the peanut butter/peanuts. So what the hell was she doing?", "The fact that the child is about 8 means she should have been taught to question foods, especially desserts, but her parents were there and not acting responsibly.", "Right?! And peanut butter cookies should be something the child KNOWS to look for, not to mention the parents should have noticed the cookies and been like\u2026 oh whooops!
