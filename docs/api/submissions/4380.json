Ultimately it\u2019s going to be the child/parents responsibility.  Peanut allergies are common but you can\u2019t expect the world to just give up peanut. \n\nMy 5 year old knows how to ask if foods have peanuts before eating.  We\u2019ve also been showing up to parties with a desert in hand for our child because 99 times out of 100 the desert/treats are not peanut safe.  Very rarely does someone go out of their way to be peanut safe without being told in advance. \n\nFor the 8-year old not to ask/know, or the parents to not mention it or inquire is a bit puzzling.

You paid the ER copay, that was already more than you needed to do. People with allergies are the ones ultimately responsible for providing visibility on them. If there's a dinner event coming up and I'm allergic to a very common thing, then I'd let everyone know and be sure to have an epi pen on hand just in case. Or I'd at least ask before blindly eating cookies that multiple family members already know are peanut butter, ones that probably smelled very obviously like it too.", "This can't be real.\n\nIf it is, NTA at all.

Thanksgiving...  That was 15-16 days ago.\n\nI used to work in billing.  The fastest we could get a bill adjudicated by insurance was 17 days after we dropped the completed claim into the queue.  Before we could drop the bill into the insurance queue, we had to get codes applied, reports dictated and filed, and signatures. That would take several days.  Maybe their EMR system is more efficient.  That included amounts applied to the deductible.\n\nThen there was the lag from when the insurance determined the amount that was due from the patient and the bills went out to the patient. (Patient bills are run on a set cycle.  On the day the bills with that last name ran, the system would send a bill for any account with a patient balance.  If your last name went out the day before the insurance cleared, you didn't get a bill for a month.)  Then you had the time it took to mail the bill to the patient.  Now, they could have printed the bill off the portal, ok, but, still, Is the $5K the total amount that was sent to the insurance carrier, or the amount that was actually due from the patient?\n\n*That's a whole lot of technical gobbledegook for are they showing you the Itemized statement - which actually means nothing unless you are private pay, and even then is negotiable - or are they showing you the actual patient due?  The $500 copay was definitely due at the time of service, though.  I would have several questions to see if cousin wasn't pulling something.*\n\nAs far as actually having peanut butter cookies in the first place, you didn't know.  Not everyone has allergies.  We don't do peanut butter cookies at my house, but we do reeses, and I buy my peanut butter in Costco quantities.  You need to warn me if you are allergic, or you are SOL.  So, N T A on the cookies.  You asked.  They didn't tell you.\n\nETA - Changed raw bill to itemized statement.", "This person came to your house, gobbled up your food, then ate a mystery cookie while suffering from a serious peanut allergy. And didn't inform you of their allergies. Also why is the bill so high if they have insurance? That $500 copay you gave them was more than generous.

Not everyone has peanut allergies and I have PB in my home as well.

For those that feel that I was in the wrong and we should be held accountable, for something we had no control over, I am sure cousin would be willing to take donations from you all.

And in your replies, it states your cousin did not know if said allergy?!  Then that is on the mother!!!  Wtf is wrong with her?  And now she will not speak to you?  Yep.  Different response.   Respond back, and I would do so in the group chat since everyone seems to be involved.  Copy and paste the portion where you asked for allergies.  Let cousin know that it was never stated of child\u2019s allergy.  Therefore you are not responsible for said bill.  Again, I would bring up while there was no epi pen available? ). I also have never heard of a 500 co pay before.  Were you there when they told you the co pay?  Or did cousin tell you?  This is all on the mother of the child.  Do not pay this bill.  You have done enough.", "I would tell cousin and his wife that not saying anything about his child's allergies plus not supervising what she ate at someone else's house is neglect worthy of being reported to child protective services.

If you can legally be held responsible, perhaps your homeowners insurance will cover it.", "Yep, every time he asks, send him back a screenshot of the part of the conversation where you asked if anyone had allergies, and his response (or lack of)", "Actually they could be. Hope they have insurance because the cousin could file a claim against their insurance", "Cousin straight-up said \"No one has any allergies.\" To me, that's even worse than not replying or being like \"I don't but idk about them\" and then never getting back to OP.", "They have insurance but I guess it's not great, only portions are covered. For instance they did tests and some of the test stuff wasn't covered.", "8 year olds are not necessarily QUITE mature enough to handle it.\n\nMy daughter is allergic to tree nuts.  She is one of the most independent, mature kids I know (age 15 now).  Her last allergic reaction was at age 10.  It was only after that time that she started taking more responsibility for her allergies.\n\nI think there were a few factors involved.  It wasn't until she was 8/9 that she really started going places without me, and usually I would be the one to check for nuts.  She knew about her allergy, but she'd never really had to do much about it. \n\nPeanuts have a strong smell, but has she been exposed to that smell much?  We jokingly talk about the 'poison club' of people who have inadvertently fed my daughter nuts, and in each case, she was given something to eat and did not realise it had nuts in it.  The last time, it was a cashew dip.  Because of her allergy, we'd never had nut dips in the house and she didn't realise there were such things.\n\nIf my daughter, who as I said, has always been incredibly mature and independent, wasn't ready to take charge of her allergy until age 10, then I'll give an 8 year old a pass.  Yes, my daughter did know about her allergy, and knew she couldn't have nuts.  But the whole being responsible herself thing didn't quite kick in until the last reaction at age 10.  Then it was like she clicked and went \"ohhhhh\" and that was it.  Perfectly responsible from then on.\n\nOn the other hand, tree nuts are a different beast to peanuts.  Tree nuts aren't as common, so we simply didn't have them in our house, she wasn't likely as a young child to encounter them often, and so the allergy just wasn't a constant presence in our minds.  Peanuts, on the other hand, are much more common, especially in the US where peanuts seem to be in nearly everything (still can't wrap my head around a peanut cake.  What IS that?).  I do know of someone with a child who is allergic to peanuts, among many other things, and that kid knew ALL about it, because the chance of encountering peanuts is much higher.", "And that's probably one one the worst things about, while it would not have been your fault or responsibility to prevent, it would still weigh heavily on your conscience.\n\nPretty much the same goes for all sorts of things were people are more or less forced into a situation they don't really have control of and something terrible is happening, like suicide by cop or throwing yourself in front of a train, reckless driving, protesters suddenly appearing on a race track in the middle of a race, and so on.

This isn't your responsibility, and you already did something really thoughtful by covering the copay.

If some of the charges fall into the category of balance billing and they live in a state where balance billing is illegal, they can get a good amount of costs dropped by pointing out \"Nope, you can't charge that.\" Here is a fact sheet that explains what this is. https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/HealthCareInCalifornia/FactSheets/fsab72.pdf", "THIS^OMG."]}
