It is semi-potluck and I make a point of asking about allergies and food preferences.\n\nThis year my cousin(36M) told me he was joining with his new wife (they got married in July) and her daughter, who is around 8. Cousin was added to the group chat and didn't say anything about allergies/preferences when asked.\n\nForward to Thanksgiving. One of the desserts I made was peanut butter cookies. My family and I love them. Cousin's SD ate one and is allergic to peanuts. I had no idea and would never have made them if I knew. Husband and I took them to a stand alone ER that was about 5 minutes from the house. We stayed with them for some time until she was transferred to the local hospital where she stayed overnight. She ended up being fine.\n\nLast week I got a text from cousin with a pic of the hospital bill. He wanted to know how I wanted to handle it. I called and he and wife expect us to pay the bill. I told him we weren't going to do that. I reminded him that he had told me nobody had allergies, and hubby and I did pay the copay at the ER ($500) because we felt bad. He had an argument and now the family is involved. They're mostly on my side but some are getting into me for having anything peanut related cause \"everybody\" has peanut allergies nowadays.\n\nThe bill is about $6k. We don't have it.

You are not responsible for this incident.", "NTA, you made a point of asking, they said nothing, then let SD eat not just something that randomly contained peanuts, but a peanut butter cookie without bothering to check.\n\nThey sound like lousy parents/stepparents tbh. My husband has a nut allergy and I check and double-check food all\\*the\\*time when I shop or when we eat out, I make a point of reminding friends and relatives when we visit, etc.", "NTA\n\nAs the parent of a child with peanut allergies, you can\u2019t expect the world to pay attention to this for you.  Ultimately it\u2019s going to be the child/parents responsibility.  Peanut allergies are common but you can\u2019t expect the world to just give up peanut. \n\nMy 5 year old knows how to ask if foods have peanuts before eating.  We\u2019ve also been showing up to parties with a desert in hand for our child because 99 times out of 100 the desert/treats are not peanut safe.  Very rarely does someone go out of their way to be peanut safe without being told in advance. \n\nFor the 8-year old not to ask/know, or the parents to not mention it or inquire is a bit puzzling.  Bad situation overall but I wouldn\u2019t hold you responsible if this was my child.  It wasn\u2019t your responsibility and you did ask.", "NTA. You paid the ER copay, that was already more than you needed to do. People with allergies are the ones ultimately responsible for providing visibility on them. If there's a dinner event coming up and I'm allergic to a very common thing, then I'd let everyone know and be sure to have an epi pen on hand just in case. Or I'd at least ask before blindly eating cookies that multiple family members already know are peanut butter, ones that probably smelled very obviously like it too.", "This can't be real.\n\nIf it is, NTA at all. If a little kid has an allergy it's the parents: responsibility to ask/tell and to educate their kid tondo the same.\n\nEdit: You were overly generous by paying the copay in the first place.", "NTA\nEspecially if he explicitly said there are no allergies.\nIf he was at a restaurant there is no way the restaurant would be held liable.", "NTA, you asked they answered. And you catered. They should have been more responsible. You\u2019re not a psychic that would read into these things on who is secretly allergic to what, and I doubt even psychics can.", "NTA\n\nHe never mentioned his SD had a peanut allergy beforehand, so it would have been his and his wife's responsibility to ask if anything contained peanuts on the day of the dinner. You can't plan for something you have no idea it might even be an issue.\n\n>some are getting into me for having anything peanut related cause \"everybody\" has peanut allergies nowadays\n\nObviously not, since everyone in your family loves them. And if you leave out everything someone might be allergic to just to be cautious, you end up with nothing to eat other than a plain piece of meat which some people still wouldn't eat because they are vegetarians, vegans or whatever else there is.", "NTA. It\u2019s possible your cousin didn\u2019t know his step daughter was allergic to them. Her mother is totally responsible for her. She is 8! Shouldn\u2019t her mother have been checking everything she wanted to eat knowing she had an serious allergy. Doesn\u2019t seem there is a relationship to save with your cousin. Keep a record of the chat where he does not disclose her allergy - just in case they take legal action.", "NTA\u2026\u2026My children are grown now\u2026BUT when they were little I was the food police and with allergies I didn\u2019t let them eat anything with out asking anybody what was in anything BEFORE it went into their mouth!", "NTA.  The parent is responsible for the welfare of their child; they need to tell people, check the desserts etc,    You would be responsible if you forced the cookie on the child, knowing they were allergic.", "You are NTA.  Smart \"Peanut Parents\" including Steps, carry around an epi-pen and Claritin or Benadryl, and make sure their kid is savvy about what they ingest.  When that child is old enough, they carry their own medicine because in spite of precautions, stuff happens.  No hate on your cuz and peanut girl's Ma, but this is their financial responsibility.  I'd advise them calling the hospital to negotiate something more sensible.", "NTA - you asked, they ignored. It\u2019s a parent\u2019s responsibility to manage their child\u2019s allergies until such time as the kid can self manag!\n\nEdited to add: I think paying the co pay was more than generous personally I\u2019d be asking for reimbursement!", "NTA. It's the mother's responsibility to be aware of her child's allergies and make sure her child doesn't consume anything with said allergen.", "NTA.  And make sure you print off copies of that text so if they try to sue you you have proof", "NTA. As a parent of a person with allergies, his duty was to tell people when you asked if there were any allergies. Failing that, he should have asked when food was served. This is on him and his wife.", "NTA Everyone I know with a child with a severe allergy is diligent about communicating their allergy and monitoring their food.  That's the parents and when old ebough the child's responsibility.  You went out of your way to ask about allergies and they didn't provide you that information.  None of this is your responsibility.", "NTA\nWhen you have a child with allergies it's your damn job as a parent to make sure your child is safe. If \"everybody has peanut allergy\", peanuts wouldn't exist anymore.", "NTA, you shouldn't have even paid the $500 copay. It's their responsibility to make sure their kid doesn't eat foods she is allergic to. I'm sure there were plenty of other options of things for her to eat.", "Info: why don\u2019t they have insurance?", "NTA the parents were responsible for ensuring her safety.", "Info...  Thanksgiving...  That was 15-16 days ago.\n\nI used to work in billing.  The fastest we could get a bill adjudicated by insurance was 17 days after we dropped the completed claim into the queue.  Before we could drop the bill into the insurance queue, we had to get codes applied, reports dictated and filed, and signatures. That would take several days.  Maybe their EMR system is more efficient.  That included amounts applied to the deductible.\n\nThen there was the lag from when the insurance determined the amount that was due from the patient and the bills went out to the patient. (Patient bills are run on a set cycle.  On the day the bills with that last name ran, the system would send a bill for any account with a patient balance.  If your last name went out the day before the insurance cleared, you didn't get a bill for a month.)  Then you had the time it took to mail the bill to the patient.  Now, they could have printed the bill off the portal, ok, but, still, Is the $5K the total amount that was sent to the insurance carrier, or the amount that was actually due from the patient?\n\n*That's a whole lot of technical gobbledegook for are they showing you the Itemized statement - which actually means nothing unless you are private pay, and even then is negotiable - or are they showing you the actual patient due?  The $500 copay was definitely due at the time of service, though.  I would have several questions to see if cousin wasn't pulling something.*\n\nAs far as actually having peanut butter cookies in the first place, you didn't know.  Not everyone has allergies.  We don't do peanut butter cookies at my house, but we do reeses, and I buy my peanut butter in Costco quantities.  You need to warn me if you are allergic, or you are SOL.  So, N T A on the cookies.  You asked.  They didn't tell you.\n\nETA - Changed raw bill to itemized statement.", "This person came to your house, gobbled up your food, then ate a mystery cookie while suffering from a serious peanut allergy. And didn't inform you of their allergies. Also why is the bill so high if they have insurance? That $500 copay you gave them was more than generous. PLEASE cross them off your future guest list and don't think of them again. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And daughter is certainly old enough to ask questions before shoving food into her mouth.  \n\nEven if you had NOT asked about allergies, your cousin should have had the sense to steer his daughter away from cookies or at least verify what was in them, first.\n\nIf he can't handle that minimum responsibility, then he should not attend the family pot-luck.\n\nYou don't pay a single penny of the hospital bill.

This is completely on them for not warning you about allergies.\n\nNTA", "NTA as long as you asked about allergies you would never be the ass", "Nope, NTA. You asked about the allergies and didn't get an answer. In that case, it's unreasonable to not make a dish everyone likes on the off chance they are allergic. If no one knew she was allergic it's still not your responsibility because that was going to be discovered one way or another. Basically what it boils down to is that YOU WERE NOT NEGLIGENT.", "NTA. Managing food allergies- informing people, asking about ingredients and paying for treatment- is the job of the allergy sufferer not the host. \nTell him it\u2019s a pity our healthcare system is so messed up but hopefully the bill will remind all 3 of them to be more vigilant about the girls allergies next time they eat out.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, you did more than enough with the $500 co-pay. Furthermore, considering this is their first time there with the kid, why not ASK what type of cookie it was or mention the allergy? Totally on them.", "NTA but your cousin sure is the a hole", "NTA. What kind if parents don't inform ppl of life threatening allergies???!!! Don't pay.", "NTA\n\nThe parents should have told you in advance about the allergy. They are completely responsible for this happening. I have an allergy to shellfish. When I was a kid, my parents policed everything I ever tried to put in my mouth. By the time I was 6 or 7, I could spot a bettered prawn or an evil scallop from a mile away lol. \n\nYou are not responsible for this bill.

For an 8-year-old child to not be cognizant of their own allergy is wild. Peanut butter cookies almost always smell of peanut butter. How was she not aware?", "I am in no way disputing what you said, and I keep hearing how common peanut allergies are but I only know one person who has it. So it wouldn't occur to me to purposely make peanut-free food (although I rarely make peanut butter things except peanut sauce for Thai food anyway). I know several more people who hate cilantro or are GF so that is something I'd think to ask about.", "Also, usually when I cook with peanut butter, it has a distinct smell, especially when it\u2019s the star of the dish, so surely someone could have smelled it and told SD not to eat then.", "I really don't know the wife at all. I met her for the first time at their wedding. I can only assume that the child was maybe a bit overwhelmed at the choice of desserts. My family is a firm believer in one whole dessert for each person attending. I do know that the cookies weren't the only dessert she ate. Maybe she got confused.", "Sadly, it's very real. I had never met the wife until the wedding, cousin and I aren't close. So I have no idea about her parenting style, etc. She didn't keep a very close eye on her daughter at the event. Like I said, I did feel and still feel bad. Responsibility or not, I would have felt horribly guilty if she hadn't turned out fine afterwards.", "Literally anything can be an allergen. People can even be allergic to water. It's literally impossible to avoid all things someone might be allergic to.", "He said he didn't know, and that's entirely possible. We aren't close, and family gossip is that it was a short relationship and something of a shotgun wedding. I assume his wife thought I knew. I really didn't get a chance to discuss it with her that evening and she's refused to speak to me or my husband since.", "Right??? Especially when the door was opened with a text asking about allergies. They could have asked when they arrived as well. Paying the copay was plenty, definitely NTA. Sounds like the cousin messed up by not mentioning it and doesn't want to be accountable, plus there was plenty of time to ask when they arrived. He or his SO could have double checked with you on arrival.", "I paid the copay because I felt horrible about the situation. I was freaking out because I was afraid I had accidentally killed her kid. I don't have children (I'm incapable) so I've never dealt with the \"child needs to go to the hospital\" scenario.", "They do, but I guess it sucks. Part of the bill is for the ambulance ride from the standalone ER to the regular hospital. Apparently they ran a bunch of tests and their insurance only covered part of that as well.", "It says payment due? I really don't understand the majority of what you said, I admit. I didn't realize bills from hospitals took that long. I've never been in the hospital overnight. Every time I've gotten a bill from my gyno or PCP it's always been online in a couple of weeks or so. He texted me Saturday and the date on it was Friday.", "It could have been an all in house thing like Kaiser does.  Had to bring in my 6week old into the ER which ended up in a 5 day hospital stay the Sunday *after* Thanksgiving.  They had the itemized bill ready the day of discharge.", "I personally don't think the cookies reek of peanut butter, but I make them all the time so maybe I've become immune to the smell. Either way, everyone is correct. There should have been questions asked.", "That's entirely possible. I've always been one of the peacemaker/mediator types in the family, so maybe he's hoping I'll just pay it to keep things smooth?", "Nobody else in the family has it (obviously). We started asking about allergies about 10 years ago when another of my cousins married someone who is allergic to onions/garlic/leeks, stuff like that. Called an alum allergy, I think? Now there's an allergy that's difficult to cook around.", "Then that's on the mother to make sure that her young child isn't eating things she's allergic to if the child is overwhelmed or confused.", "If he didn't know how were you supposed to?!?\n\nThis whole thing is ridiculous. You were already generous by paying the $500. NTA.", "It doesn't matter if your cousin knew or did not know, either way, it isn't YOUR responsibility to know that a guest has an undisclosed food allergy.  Her mother surely knew she was allergic, and it appears she did nothing to check on whether anything with peanuts was on the menu.  Why would the mother \"think you knew\" that her child had a serious did allergy?  She didn't tell you.  Cousin didn't tell you.  The kid didn't tell you.  You're NTA, and absolutely not responsible for their medical bills.", "Why didn't he just ask his wife when you texted and asked? Why did he just send back \"No. No allergies.\" How does he raise a child and literally not know that she has a severe allergy?", "I\u2019m asking to make sure they didn\u2019t show you the full bill without insurance taken out to try to scam ya. But yeah, do not pay. Negotiating medical bills is annoying but it works and you weren\u2019t at fault. Just in case tho I\u2019d check to see if your homeowners insurance covers liability. But do NOT pay.", "It would be for me because I love all those things, but there are some religions that don't eat onions/garlic. I go to a Chinese restaurant that doesn't use them and their food is so yummy I didn't even notice for a while.", "We rent, but I'll check my renters insurance. Thank you for that advice.", "I wouldn't even check your renters insurance. This is on them. They were part of the group chat they didn't list any allergies. Knowing that she has an allergy why didn't they say something when they came. I don't know how old the kid is but if they are old enough they should know to ask if something especially a cookie had peanuts in it.", "8. Definitely old enough to know not to eat a *peanut* butter cookie. Or to ask if there were nuts in the cookies."]}
