You have different perspectives on marriage. She probably sees it as a sacred bond or important life altering event. You saw it as a contractual matter that didn't change your life. It wasn't meaningful to you, you didn't want to blow it out of proportion by telling others who would misinterpret it. That she's reacted this way demonstrates that you made the right choice.\n\nThe marriage you entered into wasn't the marriage she imagines you entered into. You don't tell her about every contract you enter. Nor should you.", "NAH \u2014 I mean yes, it\u2019s marriage, but this isn\u2019t technically a step forward for your own life. Your mom didn\u2019t need to get involved in the process.\n\nTo her credit, she might have seen some repercussions that might have happened if your friend wasn\u2019t a decent person. Maybe she felt like you were in a situation where not knowing made her pretty much helpless. I bet she\u2019s still processing things.", "NTA explain to her that her reaction is exactly why you didn\u2019t tell her and leave it at that.", "It is a big secret. Not sure if it rises to betrayal.... if you normally tell your Mom \u201ceverything\u201d I can understand her disappointment.\n\nIf my daughters (26,28) did this I think I would be hurt that they just never ran it by me first for a second opinion. But no one did anything wrong. \n\nNAH", "NTA. Your \"marriage\" was transactional. You got married, covered his health issues with your insurance and helped him over a rough spot. IMO that is a very kind act on your part.\n\nFrankly, I am assuming that you are in the US where unbelievable things have been happening with the cost of basic meds (like insulin) and so on for the last few years. While I am usually a person who believes in \"following the law\" I was a nurse and remember when a bottle of insulin cost $25 and then it shot up to hundreds of dollars for one month? INSANE.\n\nSo,  your mom is really inappropriate. Your search history is yours... yea I understand why she saw it, but *she should have ignored it*. She certainly should not be so judgemental.\n\nYou did a kindness out of the goodness of your heart. Yea, maybe not totally legal  - but completely understandable. I feel sure you get free meals at that restaurant for life.\n\nI am in your corner!   I hope when you go to sleep tonight that you rest well knowing that you did the right things for the right reasons.", "NTA.

Even though it was strictly for insurance.", "She didn\u2019t care at all when I signed my contract with my phone company, and this might as well about the same amount of important to me, lol. OK that\u2019s not entirely true helping my friend was very important to me", "I\u2019ve been friends with him for over 10 years and my mom met him several times, my mom has always seen him as part of the family which I guess legally he is lol. I think the problem is my mom sees marriage is a religious sacrament, not a business relationship.", "I tell her most things but my instincts told me it would be best to keep this to myself, I just didn\u2019t want anybody making a big thing out of it, and in all honesty, I didn\u2019t want anybody talking me out of it once I made up my mind. I never meant to hurt her.", "Thank you for your  very kind words, you guessed correctly I am from the US. After he was diagnosed, he told me that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to open up the restaurant like he\u2019s been planning because he thought he\u2019d need to find a job with insurance, I remember hearing about other people getting married for insurance benefits, and after doing some research, I brought it up to him. One thing led to another after doing a lot of research and talking to his girlfriend (who was happy he\u2019d get the medicine he made without having to give up his dream) we ended up at the courthouse a week later. \n\nAnd yeah, My mom can\u2019t be pretty nosey. But I love her, and I hate this. \n\nAlso, I get better than free meals at the restaurant he cooks for me all the time,  he and his girlfriend only live a few minutes away from me and invite me over for dinner frequently. Sometimes if he knows I\u2019m working overtime. He leaves food at my doorstep.", "That\u2019s a good idea, i think when she had some time to calm down, she\u2019ll get over it", "Nope.\n\nMarriage is a qualifying life event.  They did get married.  No fraud.  As long as both parties in the marriage know what\u2019s going on.  \n\nUnlike a greencard interview, you don\u2019t have to prove to the insurance company you Didn\u2019t get married just to get health insurance.\n\nPeople get married for all kinds of reasons besides romantic or sexual relationships.  Now and historically.  Financial stability.  Getting better military housing.  Escaping abusive parents.  Hiding in places their sexuality is dangerous or illegal.  Getting considered for financial aid for college when you have parents with money who Won\u2019t help pay for it and you\u2019re under 24 (marriage excludes the parents efc).  Gaining status to run a family business.  Gaining status in some corporate/professional/political worlds (not many unmarried law partners exist or high level politicians in some parties).", "I\u2019m sure, I did a lot of research", "Your having a phone was also important to you and it had an influence on her life since it enabled her to call you. You were glad to help your friend, but the marriage didn't otherwise change your life. It's not as if you were going to get married to someone else but couldn't. It's not that you were doing anything fraudulent.", "What if you reframed it not as a business deal but as the humane and moral thing to do? \n\nYou obviously have great affection for your friend, who had a health crisis. Most people would\u2019ve done nothing but you stepped up and took a bold step to help a fellow human being. \n\nIn one of the richest countries on the planet (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in the US), we let people die from manageable diseases which is truly a travesty. You did something our politicians won\u2019t do and I think your mom should be grateful she raised such a compassionate person. For real.", "My parents are religious also and I\u2019m thinking...if I similarly ended up marrying any of my childhood friends and divorcing them, they\u2019d also be in a panic. For sure it depends on how they view marriage and also because that usually comes with being very tight knit, respect your elders kind of thinking...to them maybe it\u2019ll be like I didn\u2019t respect them enough, or put myself in a situation that\u2019s not favorable to me.\n\nIt\u2019s 2023, people are more independent now but the older generation are set in their own ways and some are pretty conservative. Your feelings are valid, but so are your mom\u2019s. She probably needs some space.", "Uh-oh, you're no longer marriage-virgin. LOL.", "Just let her know you will make sure to include her in the \u201creal\u201d wedding (if you choose to have one). She will be fine.", "Thank you, he has been there for me through some of the worst times in my life like when my dad passed away, and I really wanted to do help him, he\u2019s like a brother to me. You guessed correctly I\u2019m in American, healthcare and system is a mess to say the least.", "That might work, I think I\u2019ll give her some space and let her cool down some and give it a few more days before I try to contact her.", "To me, NTA because I see this the same way you do, as no big deal but a lot of people consider marriage sacred. I also understand not wanting to mention it because it's not worth the annoyance.", "It's none of her fucking business so nta"]}
