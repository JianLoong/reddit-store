In that case, I\u2019d start lining up your resume and looking at other opportunities, just in case they are retaliatory for you not participating, and if they do try anything to intimidate you, try and get them to text/email you that. It would definitely not hurt if you end up needing to file for hostile work environment. Best of luck to you, so sorry about your loss and the callous disregard your work seems to have for you compared to its managers.", "They won\u2019t retaliate.

NTA", "I've been in the same situation as you, regarding your uncle. It's ghastly and distressing. \n\nI also worked at a place run by unsympathetic and narcissistic AHs. When my mother died, office manager was asked to send me flowers. She said she would, but didn't, which was a dick move. A few months later, her mother died. I told the staff NOT to put my name on any card, and to my knowledge, they didn't. One of the staff sent her flowers because she felt obligated to, but I wouldn't send the old snake one damned petal. \n\nI suggest finding another job as soon as possible. THis is a toxic environment you're in.", "NTA\n\nDunno who is calling you an AH, but they're wrong.\n\nMy condolences on your loss.", "NTA and I hate offices that 'pass the hat' for life events, because they're never equal and someone always gets left out/neglected. Let management do something official and handle the logistics and money.", "look for a new job. seriously, you will not get happy in this place. NTA\n\ni was made the AH once for not giving anything to a new trainee that got 20 after my trainee got nothing because\" trainee dont get anything. \" they came up with some blahblub this one was special because he was disabled and needed it. told them the fuck right out the door. idont know any 20 year old trainee that does not need 300buck on hand. especially after contributing to every collection there was before his birthday.", "NTA- My deepest condolences on the loss of your Uncle.  You handled the situation at work  with class imo.", "NTA. I hope you can some day find a better situation, though there tend to be AHs everywhere, especially at work.", "Absolutely NTA. And I'm so sorry about your uncle and how you found him. I hope you're doing okay and have people to talk to if you need to.", "NTA. You're not obligated to help people who refused to help you.", "NTA. Also, why are they collecting money for a death? I have seen money collected at work for a wedding or baby shower but never a death.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly some people aren't fit to be called managers.", "NTA. But make it very very clear to everyone why you aren't doing it, how the manager treated you and their response to someone you were close to dying. Without context you sound like an asshole, with context they'll be pissed at the manager and feel guilty about having done nothing for you.\n\nA grandmother dying is not exactly unexpected, finding your uncle dead yourself, someone much younger than a grandparent is many many times worse and more shocking. Your manager is a giant asshole.", "Ah a good old ESH\n\nWhere i live you get 1 day for immediate family  (as in direct line of relation uncles do not count).\n\nCalling off work at short notice for a day can usually be accommodated, 3 days is quite a lot. I can see where you had trauma to process, but in doing so you forced all your colleagues to put in extra effort, and are now annoyed (?) they didn't put in more effort like do a collection and a card.\n\nNot even signing a card, which is the least amount of effort is just being an AH for being an AH.", "NTA the difference in how you were treated vs how the manager is being treated is appalling", "Even without how you were treated it\u2019s crazy to me that you collect in those circumstances. You must be constantly forking out", "Even without the backstory, you don't have to do anything.

This peer pressure to spend YOUR money needs to end.", "NTA", "NTA. At all. The way you were treated is abysmal and I would never forget it. I'm so sorry.  \nWhen I was a teen, my great aunt passed away and my workplace let me move shifts around so I could attend her funeral out of town, which was cool.   \nThe following week a coworker's grandparent died and a whole whip-around of condolence cards and collecting money for flowers, arranging a week off etc was conducted. I didn't say anything about it ever, but I obviously still remember and it felt really crappy at the time. Anyone who calls you an AH about this is ridiculous.", "NTA. Your response was reasonable all things considered.  I like the commentary about singing it with the message about hoping they are treated with the same decency and respect you were when your relative died.  Hindsight is 20/20 though.", "NTA.\n\nYou are completely justified. That's rough on you, sorry to hear that. \n\nIt drives me nuts when HR is close with management - had that at my last job and it meant that complaints about management went nowhere, even when management was horrible to multiple staff members.", "I was made the AH once for not giving anything to a new trainee that got 20 after my trainee got nothing because.NAT", "\"During this difficult time I hope you are shown the same level of compassion and decency you showed me when I lost my uncle last Thanksgiving.\" They can't get mad without telling on themselves", "Thank you!!  I\u2019ve had lots of therapy and am doing pretty good all things considered", "I can appreciate what you\u2019re saying.  Tho was literally the last of my family and was someone I was very close to as in he helped put me thru college.  I never call out and I was in shock and very traumatized and management was a complete Dick. Which is also their perogative but I shouldn\u2019t be expected to forgot their actions or participate in their loss.  Honestly they could could have their family wiped out and I\u2019d probably still say fuck off", "\"Forced your colleagues to put in extra effort\" Damn right, that's what you do in a situation like this! If someone I knew (even someone I didnt like) found a week-old corpse of a loved one, I'd be absolutely falling over myself to make life easier for them. This is a no-brainer situation where basic human compassion obviously takes precedent over \"oh well technically according to the contract you dont get any time off so I'm afraid you'll just have to get over it.\"", "Wow. What a completely and absolutely selfish take. \n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take three days to mourn and process the death of a relative you were close into that you were the one to find their week old bloated corpse with the associated sickly sweet smell that never leaves your head. If you do you\u2019re a horrible coworker and a burden. You should be happy to sign a condolence card for the management that threatened to fire you for taking a few days to deal with your loved ones death and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re an AH\u201d\n\nEither you are middle management or that is your highest aspiration in life, both of which I find rather sad.", "You're definitely NTA. And I don't think I would want to sign the card either (unless that particular manager wasn't involved in the lack of empathy you received when your uncle passed away <my condolences>). But WTF is this collection for?!? I understand office culture and everyone signing a card but I don't understand taking up a collection...\ud83e\udd14", "That's good to hear :)", "The esh is for not giving condolences", "Flowers.", "While being NTA for the post and not participating is entirely your choice and other simply will have to respect that. Condolences for your Uncle.\n\nJust be careful about the \"can't be replaced\" attitude, while it can seem well and good now, there has yet to be a job on the planet that wasn't replaceable."]}
