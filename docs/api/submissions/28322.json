If someone I knew (even someone I didnt like) found a week-old corpse of a loved one, I'd be absolutely falling over myself to make life easier for them.

Why do people want us to give money to our bosses or buy them presents? The only answer I can come up with is BROWN-NOSING. And, when you think about it, only the person that takes the money/card/present to the boss gets credit.\n\nIf you have a good, personal relationship with your boss (it can happen) then by all means give them something as appropriate.
