{"id": 2746, "submission_id": "yzkcfs", "title": "WIBTA for charging my cousin every time I babysit her daughter?", "selftext": "Apologies if this is worded and formatted in a weird way, English isn't my first language, and I'm on Reddit Mobile.\n\nFor the past week or so my cousin [38f], her husband [?], and their daughter [6] have been staying in me [16m] and my mom's [55] tiny 2 bedroom apartment while their house is being renovated. I don't think I'd mind them staying over, if they weren't so... for lack of a better word, \"obnoxious\". \n\nCousin has taken over the living room by rearranging all the furniture, and declaring that whenever her daughter is napping or sleeping, I am absolutely not allowed to enter the living room, even if it's just for a moment. The only exception is when I'm supposed to go to school, and even then if I make even the slightest noise, like letting my keys jingle, I get scolded by her the moment I get back home for being \"loud and rude\". They also seem to think they have free reign over the house. They constantly barge into our bedrooms and to try and claim the beds, because the air mattresses they brought are \"inadequate\", they've used our shampoos and soaps despite the fact that they brought their own, I think they've even used our toothbrushes and clothes. They don't even clean up for themselves after meals, it's always my mom's job and even though I get to help her, I still feel so bad for her.\n\nHere's where our problem arises. Cousin asks that I babysit her daughter after school while she and her husband work, which I don't mind all too much. She's a sweet kid, she loves playing games, having stories read to her, I've even gotten to teach her how to play Smash Bros. Problem is she takes everything up to 100. She plays rough, she likes hitting and screaming and making me chase her around the house, and her tantrums are rough. I often have to hold her back until she's calm enough to console because she tries to break things and hit herself against furniture. After talking with some friends about it, they suggested I start to charge my cousin for babysitting her daughter.\n\nI tried to talk to my mom about it, I told her I'd only charge cousin 10 bucks total every time I babysat her daughter, but my mom is very very against it. She says I'm being really rude by trying to get money out of my cousin when she's going through a tough time. She says my cousin may need the money to pay off the house repairs, and I am not in any place to take it from her, especially when she is so stressed. While I understand that, it's not like I'd be asking cousin for money she doesn't have. She buys fast food and Starbucks for herself every day, sometimes even a few times a day, I doubt 10 bucks would make much of a dent in her budget. Plus, with the way she has been acting, I think repaying me and my mom in some way is the least she can do, but maybe my stance on this is wrong.\n\nAm I the asshole for this?", "created_utc": 1668887216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzkcfs/wibta_for_charging_my_cousin_every_time_i_babysit/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are allowed to have your own life.\n\nTherefore if you're going to babysit her child, you deserve to be compensated.", "NTA.  The price is really fair.  What you are doing is a lot of work.  Ask away.", "NTA. You were not created to be a doormat for others to walk all over. Despite what your mom says these people have been abusive and ungrateful and thoughtless. Not only should you charge them but you should charge them more. You should not be made to creep around in YOUR home or have you personal space invaded or forced out of your own bed. No mother should allow their child to be treated this way. I am so sorry!", "NTA. You should absolutely charge for babysitting when it\u2019s expected of you and your mom needs to get a backbone and not let them walk all over her. \n\nHer house is being renovated. Gee how nice. They have the money to renovate their house but not pay you?  WRONG.  They are not acting grateful to your mom either. \n\nI\u2019m 57 and their entitlement is awful.  I really hope your mom gets a backbone and you should get paid. Or just maybe go to a friends house after school instead.", "NTA. If they can afford Starbucks, they can afford to pay you an absolute bargain price for babysitting services.", "NTA \n\nYou are providing a service and should be compensated for your time.\n\nWhat was your cousin doing for childcare before she moved in with you and your mum? Because that's always still a option.", "NTA she can find a different babysitter otherwise your mom should be encouraging you to set boundaries.", "NTA $10 is a steal, they should be offering.", "NTA. $10 for an afternoon is beyond reasonable. If she doesn\u2019t want to pay it, don\u2019t do it. Or if money is truly an issue for her (although if she has Starbucks money, she definitely has babysitting money \ud83d\ude44) offer some sort of barter. You watch her kid in exchange for driving you somewhere? Helping you with a project? Idk. Whatever you decide, set your boundaries and stick to them.\n\nShe is incredibly inconsiderate for even putting you in that situation and your mom is also obnoxious for enabling behavior that takes advantage of you.", "NTA.\n\nBabysitting their child is not your responsibility. And with the way they act, they could atleast pay you with all the demands they\u2019re making in a place they don\u2019t even own and are living in.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would she NOT have to pay you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this is easy: Just stop babysitting for your cousin, and let your mom do it. Find other clients that actually pay you.", "NTA What was your cousin doing for daycare BEFORE they moved in with your mom, using you for free babysitting may be where her extra money is coming from.", "I would work with your mom to get them moving out soon. That would be the better option. \n\nNTA IF You and your mom you decide to charge, but don't start it tomorrow. Say something like \"starting January 1st, I either could get a job or I'm going to have to charge to babysit\".  \n\nBut you gotta think this through first. If you don't babysit, your cousin has to hire a babysitter. Where? Likely in your house - that's not better. Or, cousin quits work; in my experience most likely thing; and that is WAY WORSE. \n\nEvery time I've let a friend or family stay, the first thing that happens is they quit work. Your cousin there all day not going to work will be a lot worse for you! \n\nWhile you could charge, you might be better off asking her to bring you a sandwich once in a while. But my best advice is: talk with mom and follow her advice, for now.", "NTA. Entitled family members are a personal pet peeve of mine. Being related to someone doesn\u2019t mean your time isn\u2019t valuable and that you don\u2019t deserve to be paid for it. You deserve to be paid for babysitting.", "NTA. You\u2019re being kind enough to babysit for them for free and they\u2019re taking advantage of it. They\u2019re rude to you but you\u2019ll still keep babysitting because you\u2019re there. You should absolutely start charging, as then maybe they\u2019d figure out how to actually parent their own child instead of you.", "NTA Please charge her, she is very rude and entitled.", "NTA You deserve to have your one life and not be forced to babysit all the time for nothin. And honestly your cousin is an AH here, not giving your family their privacy, taking over the bedrooms, scolding you for making the slightest noise in YOUR HOUSE when you were just trying to go to school. They need to learn boundaries, and respect for other people.", "NTA - ruddy heck, I\u2019d start at $10/hour or part there of, and if they whine, double it every time. Then when they try force your hand with a kid dump, call CPS.", "NTA but your can\u2019t force her to pay you when your m0m is being unsupportive. Hopefully your mom can babysit and you can find someway to stay out of the house with friends or an afterschool job. Your mom made a mistake allowing that family into her home.", "Nta. They're not staying with you because they're short on funds, they're staying because they're renovating. It's perfectly reasonable for you to ask to be compensated for your time.", "NTA.  First, they're rude, entitled freeloaders.  They're already staying in your home for free, now they expect you to give your time for free as well?  Second, their daughter sounds like more than a handful--she sounds like she needs serious evaluation for mental or developmental issues.  Physical aggression, property destruction and self-harm are worrying in one her age, and it doesn't sound like her parents are doing anything about it.  Even if she doesn't have mental or developmental issues (and she may very well not), she needs to be trained out of her tantums or she'll be irretrievably spoiled.  But you shouldn't have to manager her, especially for free!", "Nta, you absolutely should ask to be compensated for your time. It\u2019s great to help people out sometimes, especially family for a lot of people, but everyone has a line and you\u2019ve reached a point that you feel you\u2019re being taken advantage of and I would agree. I had a client once tell me I deserved more than I was charging and when they asked me again how much I wanted, I was kind of shocked and didn\u2019t know what to say and they told me to have a backbone- really stuck with me lol. Don\u2019t be afraid to advocate for yourself.", "NTA, 1st of all set your house rules. You live there and they are guests. You can make as much noise as possible if they yell at you, tell them to leave as it's not their home and not their rules. Don't like it leave. If they ever scold you again make noise on purpose and tell them you will not take their attitude any longer in your home. They own you an apology and until they don't give you one you will make extra noise just to piss them off. They scold you more things will just get worse for them. Tell them to stay away from your bed. They don't like it. Go to a shelter. \nAs for babysitting, take a minimum of $30 each time paid in full up front. No they don't want to pay then no babysitting end of story. They need tough love.", "NTA. Or refuse to babysit.  And ignore her when she tells you that you cant enter or remind her that they are GUESTS and you WILL go where you want in your apartment.  Your mom should have put boundaries in place.", "NAH\n\nMaybe instead of charging her just explain you can't handle doing it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The parents seem to have no reasonable boundaries from the way you described and it\u2019s totally fair to ask some money for doing a job. Your family is already doing a huge favour by accomodating 3 extra people while they renovate", "Thank you! I really appreciate the kind words and the input :)", "I've been avoiding being at home quite a lot already, it's hard to find places to go since it's winter and therefore very cold here where I am, but I will try to figure something out should this babysitting thing not work out. Thank you so much for your input!", "I'm not entirely sure what they were doing? I think their daughter went to a care facility when she wasn't at school, but I've heard those are expensive so I don't know what the situation is there.", "IIRC her daughter went to a care facility after school, so you may be right.", "It's not that I can't handle it at all, I'm happy to do it honestly, it's just the way they're acting about it. I am considering other options instead of charging, thanks to the advice I've gotten in other comments.", "Of course! You truly sound like a lovely young person and deserve to be respected and honored. I would NEVER displace my 16 year old from their room or allow them to be made to feel uncomfortable in our home.", "If there is a library near you, hang out there.", "I\u2019m in Canada so understand cold lol. \n\nThe thing to remind everyone is that they decided to do a renovation which is a LUXURY to most people and costs associated with that are something they knew about - including babysitting!   They should be paying your mom rent too and not acting like that.  I wonder why you mom wont stand up for herself?", "Still not your problem. They have other options available if they don't want to pay you.", "I apologize, that probably read poorly. I didn't mean to accuse you, just the post read to me like you were fed up with having to handle it. There are people who would kill for 10 bucks for a babysitter regardless.", "I honestly don't know why I never thought of that, the closest library is owned by my school so I thankfully don't need a card to get in. Thanks for the idea!", "I came to the comments to suggest the library. Lol", "My mom is a very firm believer in \"blood is thicker than water\", she thinks she should help her family no matter what the situation is, absolutely zero strings attached. I kinda understand where she's coming from, she's always been a very caring person, but it means she lets herself get walked all over constantly, it's terrible.", "It's alright! Thank you so much for your input! :)", "Then she should also believe the cousin should pay you for your time. If the cousin cared.
