I live with 3 other people and we take turns cooking. I, like you, enjoy nice food and I cook nice things, the others sometimes do but usually cook cheaper and easier meals. We don't complain when the others cook because they're taking the time, effort, and money to make the food. If one of us don't like it, we get our own food.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds entitled in this situation. I know I'm just some random on reddit, but I get the feeling he's lying about enjoying crappy food because he doesn't want to go through the effort of cooking something nice. He could be insecure about his cooking or lazy, or it really could just be a money thing. Maybe you could try making a budget with him, or cook something new together so you both can learn and grow. Regardless, if I were in your situation, I would try to get to the root of the problem.", "NTA-you made a meal that he enjoys and you got food that you wanted. \n\nIt really sounds like you two are having compatibility issues.

Would it have been nice to order him some too? Sure, I guess. Would it have been nice to tell him, before cooking his, that you were definitely getting takeout for yourself anyhow? Probably. \n\nHe created this situation himself, tho. You keep separate finances, so you're not spending his money. You, assumedly, pay your share of bills on time. He told you he *likes* those lower-budget, sometimes lower-effort meals. You made him something you *thought* he'd prefer, and got yourself something *you'd* prefer. I see nothing wrong with this. Again, **NTA.**", "NTA, but also keep doing this. Or consider getting yourself take out on the nights where he cooks so you don't have to eat the cheap food he makes that you clearly are just tolerating and don't enjoy. You get to spend your money how you want.", "NTA. you offered him a takeaway and he said no. You made him what he\u2019s made before so obviously he approves of it and likes it.", "NTA\u2026it would have been much easier not to cook him shit. It was a good compromise.", "~~INFO: Are your finances separate or joined?~~\n\n~~I think if your finances are separate, you both can choose to spend your money as you choose and I would vote N T A. Your boyfriend is allowed to Iive as he wants but he explicitly said he didn't want takeaway. If you two put money towards a shared account, then E S H. If that's the case, you two need to create a budget you both agree on.~~\n\nSitting down and agreeing on a budget might be helpful regardless. This current situation seems stressful for the both of you and not sustainable. It sounds like the two of you have different relationships with money and different perspectives on the life you want to lead. This exercise might also help him feel better if he can see that the two of you can splurge sometimes and still be within budget and/or you might find he's right and you two aren't saving as much or as financially sustainable as you think. Without knowing what you earn and how much you spend, I have no idea. But if you're going to be in a long-term relationship, y'all need to be on the same page.\n\nEdit: I see that OP shared in the comments they're separate and his partner keeps his finances a secret. NTA but that's sorta bizarre given you are in a relationship and living together. It's his right to, but it sounds like a really difficult situation for OP and sorta controlling (intentional or not) of his partner to try to dictate how OP spends his own money. It doesn't sound like OP's partner has a very healthy relationship with money or he has debts/financial obligations he's not sharing.
