I live with 3 other people and we take turns cooking. I, like you, enjoy nice food and I cook nice things, the others sometimes do but usually cook cheaper and easier meals. We don't complain when the others cook because they're taking the time, effort, and money to make the food. If one of us don't like it, we get our own food.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds entitled in this situation. I know I'm just some random on reddit, but I get the feeling he's lying about enjoying crappy food because he doesn't want to go through the effort of cooking something nice. He could be insecure about his cooking or lazy, or it really could just be a money thing. Maybe you could try making a budget with him, or cook something new together so you both can learn and grow. Regardless, if I were in your situation, I would try to get to the root of the problem.", "NTA-you made a meal that he enjoys and you got food that you wanted. \n\nIt really sounds like you two are having compatibility issues.

Would it have been nice to order him some too? Sure, I guess. Would it have been nice to tell him, before cooking his, that you were definitely getting takeout for yourself anyhow? Probably. \n\nHe created this situation himself, tho. You keep separate finances, so you're not spending his money. You, assumedly, pay your share of bills on time. He told you he *likes* those lower-budget, sometimes lower-effort meals. You made him something you *thought* he'd prefer, and got yourself something *you'd* prefer. I see nothing wrong with this. Again, **NTA.**", "NTA, but also keep doing this. Or consider getting yourself take out on the nights where he cooks so you don't have to eat the cheap food he makes that you clearly are just tolerating and don't enjoy. You get to spend your money how you want.", "NTA. you offered him a takeaway and he said no. You made him what he\u2019s made before so obviously he approves of it and likes it.", "NTA\u2026it would have been much easier not to cook him shit. It was a good compromise.", "~~INFO: Are your finances separate or joined?~~\n\n~~I think if your finances are separate, you both can choose to spend your money as you choose and I would vote N T A. Your boyfriend is allowed to Iive as he wants but he explicitly said he didn't want takeaway. If you two put money towards a shared account, then E S H. If that's the case, you two need to create a budget you both agree on.~~\n\nSitting down and agreeing on a budget might be helpful regardless. This current situation seems stressful for the both of you and not sustainable. It sounds like the two of you have different relationships with money and different perspectives on the life you want to lead. This exercise might also help him feel better if he can see that the two of you can splurge sometimes and still be within budget and/or you might find he's right and you two aren't saving as much or as financially sustainable as you think. Without knowing what you earn and how much you spend, I have no idea. But if you're going to be in a long-term relationship, y'all need to be on the same page.\n\nEdit: I see that OP shared in the comments they're separate and his partner keeps his finances a secret. NTA but that's sorta bizarre given you are in a relationship and living together. It's his right to, but it sounds like a really difficult situation for OP and sorta controlling (intentional or not) of his partner to try to dictate how OP spends his own money. It doesn't sound like OP's partner has a very healthy relationship with money or he has debts/financial obligations he's not sharing.

Obviously it isn't all good as you're here complaining about your problems.", "This is the problem, right here.\n You cook more expensive food more days a week.\n\nSo you are carrying most of the food budget, and he won't share the cost.\n\nIf he wants to eat cheap, he can. If you don't, don't. But the fact he won't fairly split the food expenses and the work is the problem.\n\nHe's happy to let you subsidize his budget and his free time.", "I guess my sentiment wasn't clear. I don't think OP is in the wrong for making that for him...I just think it's gross.   \nWhere I think she went wrong is making it and leaving it in the microwave. Either refrigerate it or don't make it.  \n\n\nSeems that OP said it was suddenly an issue because of the \"cost of living crisis.\"", "But he\u2019s fine spending your money.", "\ud83d\ude12 if you all are living together as a couple then you need to make financial decisions together.  It might be your money but you've meshes your finances with his.  Do you see this relationship going anywhere besides shacking up together? Are you just roommates or are you a couple?", "He doesn\u2019t tip? But has money for clothes, video games and bro nights? You need to upgrade your BF.", "This ^ from reading that he keeps his finances a secret and buying cheapest of food when he is doing the dinner may suggest some financial hardship on his part.", "I hope after typing it all out it's more obvious to you that you're being grifted for your time, money, and cooking skills. Good luck, hope you dump him. NTA.", "NTA but sounds like you have trouble articulating what you actually want and are hoping to get the message across with passive aggressive behavior. I have exactly the same issue with my roommate who doesn't pick up on hints. Try setting expectations on what's for dinner each week. If it's you eat your own food and he eats his own, so be it.", "Hello Fresh", "Nah. NTA. If he wants to eat food you bought and cooked, he needs to chip in. Otherwise he can keep eating his crappy stuff. Only make him stuff he \u2018bought\u2019 and he\u2019ll change his tune soon enough. \n\nCook for yourself and cook for him \u2018his food\u2019 and eventually he\u2019ll get on board.", "NTA but this sounds like a miserable way to spend the rest of your life\u2026", "NTA. He needs some perspective. Maybe some counseling.", "Sounds like me and my husband. I make brisket, he makes mac and cheese.\n\nNTA", "NTA- but it looks like he prefers you carry the weight of the food bill. Nothing wrong with keeping finances separate but it's a bit of a red flag that he isnt willing to work with you on a grocery budget that will benefit the both of you. And of he isnt willing to work with you then maybe keeping meal making separate all the time might be the best solution. Your comfort and likes are just as important and you deserve it since you are paying for them.", "This is what you should do every time you cook from now on. NTA", "NTA, he didn\u2019t have a problem with that meal when he served it to you. Any chance he\u2019s deliberately serving shitty food so you\u2019ll cook all the time, or be the one to order and pay for the takeout? Either way, Scrooge needs to relax and cut out the double standard. If he can serve it to you then you can serve it to him.", "If he won\u2019t pay for the food he should get what he buys and nothing else.", "It sounds like he's perfectly fine with nicer meals and ingredients as well as ordering takeaway as long as it's HIS money and HE is the one preparing the food.\n\nHe's being manipulative and cheap.", "ESH. Communicate. Being passive aggressive isn't going to fix your problem, you need to talk to him about how you feel.", "Good for you, calling him on his crap.

You think that\u2019s normal. I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s exactly how people get trapped into another persons shitty situation. There are massive red flags with OPs significant other.
