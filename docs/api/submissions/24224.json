In my early 20s I was completely oblivious to stuff like this, so if the wife is around that age I wouldn't be surprised.", "I mean, if she needs it explained to her, her judgment isn't trustworthy, even if her intentions are.", "I'm with OP on this one, but I don't think I agree with this, her boss invited her, she can't really just invite her husband, she can however not go", "I think you are unfairly putting intention on his wife that might not be there. The boss probably highly values the wife and so the implication that her boss is actually after something more is likely upsetting to her as it devalues her contributions as an employee. I could see why wife is defensive albeit perhaps naively so.", "She could just be that clueless, but yea I'd be annoyed that she can't see it", "If she needs it explained to her, it\u2019s because she intends to fuck her boss.", "Generally when you invite your married employee to a fun outing the implication is the spouse is invited too, unless it's the whole department and  it is employees only.", "Yes, OP DO NOT!

Quit trying to gaslight people into thinking this is normal behavior. If you feel like this is normal behavior and are a boss, you need to rethink how you interact with your employees.

But I'm sure HR would not have approved. \n\nMakes me all the more thankful for the path that my work life has taken. If I had to rule out anything HR might have deemed as potentially  harmful, I and a good number of other people would have had a lot less fun in our careers than we have. And got to enjoy less of the fruits of the companies labour by being catered for.\n\nBut you win, depending on the specifics of the visit, HR might not approve.\n\nAnd as I said initially, it could absolutely be sus. \n\nBut if I felt good and not creepy vibes about the boat trip, my life experience says it would likely be a fun experience and not at all bad. \n\nFeel bad if that's not how it is for you though, sending happy thoughts.", "You're not good at this, just a little heads up."]}
