Today her boss messaged her and said that he is vacationing about an hour and a half away from where we live. He asked if she would be interested in driving up at his vacation home to spend a day at the lake on his boat. I find the proposition very unprofessional and inappropriate. I told her I didn\u2019t feel good about it and it would be better if she meet up with him in a professional setting like a restaurant. I think it\u2019s very odd that her boss invited her to just hangout on a Saturday. They are coworkers not buddies. She told me that she\u2019s gonna miss out on valuable networking because I\u2019m being jealous. I don\u2019t think this is coming from a place of jealously. Ive worked in the professional world for ten years and I\u2019ve never heard of a corporate boss having good intentions in these type of scenarios. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, AITA?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHer boss says his family is with him. Even though that changes the dynamic, I still feel like this could be an  isolating situation and I don\u2019t like it. The fact she is the only one invited rubs me the wrong way. I know that if I was in a similar situation my wife would expect me to decline if she couldn\u2019t go. At this point it\u2019s a touchy subject in the house and I don\u2019t want to ask anymore questions until things cool off.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nA couple people have asked how this was proposed to her. She has Microsoft teams meetings with her company  everyday at the end of work. After the business talk is over they just communicate like normal people and ask what each other plans are for the weekend. She told her team (including her boss) that she doesn\u2019t have anything going on because her husband (me) will be out of town this weekend. After everybody signed off, he messaged her privately and said something to the effect, \u201cHey since you don\u2019t have anything going on this weekend\u2026.\u201d So it wasn\u2019t like he DIDNT invite me but he asked her knowing she would be going by herself.", "created_utc": 1691545056, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m14tj/aita_wifes_boss_wants_to_hangout_this_weekend_i/", "score": 1064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tough call for you and your wife", "With update 1 and 2 I would have to go with YTA.   \n\nIf it was an out of the blue 1 on 1 invite I would be completely in the nta camp. But with the facts that she was saying she had nothing to do over the weekend in a group chat as op is out of town boss who happens to be near by with family is offering a way to meet up and get to know each other better while having fun, yta.", "YTA\n\nYou purposely left out that his family would be there and she said she was free and had no plans this weekend because you, her husband, is out of town. Sounds like he was just offering her something to do with his family. It's not the creepy one on one you originally portrayed it to be for Internet points.", "YTA - she shouldn't be under any obligation to do this, but equally it's up to her not you if she wants to and as she say's it probably is valuable for networking. I'd question why her whole family weren't invited if he's with his family but you've said in edit 2 that the boss already knew you were away so that explains that.  \nMost importantly there is absolutely no reason you should have any reason to object to this happening; you already have plans, she thinks it will benefit her career, there's no reason to believe anything nefarious is going on, gtfo your hang ups whatever they are.", "I'll go against the grain here and say YTA, you trickled some important details here in the edit. The fact that he's with his family and he invited her with the understanding that you're out of town leads me to believe this isn't weird at all. If he knew you were available and didn't invite you, that would be weird. If he was alone, that would be weird.\n\nI'm a married woman who works in a male dominated field. My husband travels for work a lot. If someone on my team or my boss was in my area traveling, I'd be excited if they reached out and wanted to invite me to an activity with their family, and I wouldn't read it as inappropriate at all. Of course, I'd expect them to also invite my husband, but if he was out of town I would happily go alone. I know my husband wouldn't have a problem with it. Getting rare face-to-face time with coworkers can be valuable and fun -- IMO it should be your wife's choice to participate if she wants to.", "**Where does it say her husband is not invited?** People have business dealing in lots of places not an office or restaurant. I think the boss is looking at it as a chance to meet his employee. His whole family is also going to be there.", "YTA. Seems like he was inviting her to join his family somewhere nice whilst you are away. Sad world we live in when people always assume the worst of others. You clearly do t trust her or her boss. Why?", "NTA.  This is just super unprofessional and bizarre.  I\u2019d also consider it inappropriate if it was a straight female or gay male boss making the invite.  They don\u2019t work together in person and haven\u2019t had so much as a coffee, so to invite a subordinate to drive 3 hours round trip to hang out alone on a boat?  Nope!", "NTA,\n\nThis dudes trying to bang your wife.\n\nYou either stop this or get a divorce. \n\nThe scenario is clear as daylight", "NTA. If only your wife is invited and not you.", "Op's wife know what she is doing, they are likely fucking already and she clearly doesn't care about your feelings or thoughts.", "Nta you shouldn\u2019t think they never met. They can easily webcam from home during 1-1 meeting. So they might already see what each other look like and hence the attraction. This is weird and imply exactly what we\u2019re all thinking. Your wife is 1) extremely naive or 2) know exactly what he means and is ok with it.", "Very creepy and unprofessional.\n\nUnless it was a company type event, there is no reason at all that a boss would only invite one coworker to his private cabin and boat.\n\nWhat networking?  He's on vacation, alone, with your wife.  What networking will be done there that couldn't be done while at work?  We all know the answer to that.\n\nI'd start getting suspicious if she keeps pushing this.", "Your wife is disrespecting you by wanting to go", "Yeh... the more I read the more I'm sure I'd tell hernthat if she can't shut him down then I'll do it myself", "YTA for intentionally leaving out information to make yourself seem better. She will be with his FAMILY including his wife. She was only asked after she said she was going to be alone all weekend because you are going out of town. Nice way to spin it to make yourself seem the victim. You did not get invited because you won't even be here and the way you left all that out of your original post screams AH.", "YTA because you need to trust your wife. If you\u2019re worried about her, then set up a contingency plan.\n\nDecide together:\n* how do you know if something bad happened? (Eg scheduled checkins, safe word she can use on the phone or via text)\n\n* what do you do if something bad happens? (Get the address, she texts you pic of boat when she sees it so you can show to authorities, etc)\n\nIt\u2019s your wife\u2019s career, and if you trust her, then your concern should be her safety and not the possibility of an old man oggling her.", "OP has clarified it isn't 1-on-1, and that boss already knew husband had plans when inviting just the wife. People saying he's the asshole are just people who can trust their partners and don't get why he can't.", "Those intentions could be to tell her that the company is buying another company and he wants her to run it. Or that the company is down sizing and he wants her help picking the 30% to be let go.\n\nThere are times in the corporate world when you want a face to face meeting, without anyone taking minutes, without other colleagues knowing that it is happening, and without spouses.", "Better yet.... why would he invite her WITH his wife and kids there", "I full agree too. OP purposely left out a lot of context.", "I hear what your saying and that\u2019s what she\u2019s saying. My point is that theres a lot that could go wrong in this scenario and for what? I just can\u2019t wrap my head around why the owner of a large company would want to casually hangout with one specific employee on the weekend. It makes it worse IMO that it\u2019s an hour and a half away and her spouse is out of town. A corporate leader shouldn\u2019t proposition swimsuit time with his subordinates. It\u2019s just inappropriate to me. I wouldn\u2019t have an issue if it was meet up half way at a restaurant.", "Hey - my former boss gave me the same invite. Subsequently, he was fired for sexual harassment of several women under him\n\nIt was hard for me to see what was happening because I thought he valued my skills. She's probably in denial, this stuff hits hard", "Dude I would say no and just lie I have family coming to visit. No sane person would say yes to this weird creepy as f invitation", "That's kinda r00d...but guess it's expected when you post to the internet.", "I'd confirm that myself", "While what you say is true, that\u2019s it\u2019s the boss that OP can\u2019t trust, a lot of people (especially women) will say that OP should trust his wife to reject her boss\u2019 advances. But, this is an unsafe and isolating situation where he could force himself on her, get her drunk or roofie her, so OP is correct in being worried even if he does trust her.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "\"I trust her, I just don't trust him,\" is the biggest schmuck phrase in the English language", "It is clearly her he doesn't trust, the boss can't do anything on his own!", "His invitation is on her left ring finger. And id have already invited myself", "\"Most men that are not blood related and invite you to a non business related 1 to 1 wanna fuck you, especially if you're an attractive woman.\"\n\nThat's just... so fucking sad. I'm not saying your generalization is totally accurate or inaccurate, but the fact that this generalization exists is a pathetic condemnation of men in society.", "Did you read past the second sentence or just stop there?", "Jeffrey Epstein brought his girlfriend with him - women were still raped.", "There's no scenario where she goes without me if I'm OP.", "As far as OP knows. My gut says they are closer then she's saying", "Yes he can.", "Yes. Yes she can invite her husband. She already should have", "i did, but we don\u2019t need the second half of your reply, because the post isn\u2019t about just meeting in a professional setting. it\u2019s meeting on a boat, 1-on-1 in a lake. \n\nOP already said he\u2019d be fine if it was a professional setting we know this information already", "So all other coworkers in that meeting had plans?  The guy only DMed her about the plans with his family.  Why not invite everyone else?  Even if other people had plans, I bet most of them would go for meeting of many coworkers at a lake house.  Then it just becomes a party to get to know people, not potentially 1 on 1 time.  Also, him saying that his family will be there means little. What if she shows and they aren't there?  Oh, they just ran into town to get some groceries.  Blah blah blah.\n\nThis is some shady shit by the boss and your wife is not dumb.  If she was naive, she wouldn't have become so defensive imo", "\n\n>As far as OP knows. My gut says they are closer then she's saying\n\nHonestly that would make a lot more sense than her going off for a day with this man she's never seen outside of zoom.", "Literally. She should have made it clear she's bringing her husband within 30 seconds of being invited", "I\u2019m seeing that \ud83d\ude02 like 2 days ago when this sub was telling some chick who was going to dump her long time BF over shaving his body hair. \u201cOh honey N T A. Everyone\u2019s allowed preferences and you need to stand by yours\u201d \n\nToday some dudes like \u201cmy gf wants cheek reductions and idk if I can handle that\u201d and we get \u201cY T A. So shallow. Misogynist. Grow up\u201d \ud83d\ude02 \nI love it!", "Also... zoom. The opportunity to network already exists. Bringing his wife in kids into the mix don't make it a better opportunity. Also why would his wife be ok with this", "NO! Why is she even thinking of going?", ">some dude she barely knows\n\nAlso a dude that could leverage his authority as her boss", "It is a lake. If things go awry, she *can* swim to the shore, even if it's a big one. And a lake during summer time is not exactly a no man's land...", "Did you miss the part where she works from home?", "This exactly", "So these women ARE in danger?!", "Networking with his wife and kids?", "Guess she can work on her oral skills", "Then she values her career more than her marriage."]}
