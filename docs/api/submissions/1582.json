Everyone loves it there, it\u2019s a safe space. I\u2019m also 20 and still go trick or treating! I\u2019d fucking love a Halloween bucket every other time. \nKeep it up, I\u2019m sure she appreciates the effort and time you all put into making her feel so loved :)", "She came after you and your authority first so, fair game? NTA", "NTA\n\nBtw I sent my almost 19 year old Halloween sweets to uni last month and Im planning on sending not only him an advent calendar but all his flatmates - because he may be an adult but he's still my child (and his older sister made it very clear that despite her having moved out last year she wanted her advent calendar - and stocking\n\nMy parents did me a stocking until I had a child of my own", "NTA. First, you didn\u2019t undermine her. She wasn\u2019t disciplining her children or trying to teach them anything that you then interrupted or contradicted. She was belittling your child and you stood up for your child. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m 30 and my siblings are 25 & 28. My mom still makes us treat bags for Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter and Halloween. Who doesn\u2019t like getting a gift? It shows she\u2019s thinking of us. Plus it always has our favorite candy and something thoughtful we\u2019d enjoy. Never stop giving your daughter her candy bucket. It\u2019s a family tradition", "NTA. Honey, my kiddos are 22 and 25. I mail them (and their grandfather) a Halloween care package of candy and treats every year. It\u2019s my way of letting them know they are loved and though about. It always results in lovely phone calls where we reminisce about halloweens past and and swap photos of our pumpkins. I have many friends that do the same for their adult children who live away. \n\nSadly, your sister was behaving in an entitled manner. Sure her initial questioning of your daughter\u2019s bucket was rude but she should have dropped it. When she belittled the build-a-bear card and said the bucket should be divided among her children she overstepped. She deserved the response she got and needs to back off.", "NTA.\n\nI'd be thrilled if someone made ME a Halloween bucket.", "NTA. And, OP, please don't get this woman any more gifts. When she asks why you're not giving her gifts, remind her that gifts are for children, and she is NOT a child.\n\nIt sounds like this woman needs to be put in her place more to grow to become a better person.", "Off topic (kind of) but I'm 28, and I recently found the website (through fb) send-a-friend.  And you can send stuffies!! To ANYONE!!  You can bet your ass i sent myself the owl (obviously, I am THE owlboy after all) and promptly forgot about it until I came home from work one day and my roommate was like.. did you order something?  AND THERE IT WAS!!  Oh my gosh best gift to myself ever; when I have enough money (and it comes back into stock) I'm ordering the lobster next! It's so cute!!", "OP, my kids are in their 30s and I send them Easter baskets with return address from E. Bunny. They know their mom loves them and is a little weird.", "I encouraged my kids to go trick on treating while they still lived at home. Most of the parents in our neighborhood make sure we have plenty of candy to pass out to teenagers too(plus good candy for the parents). I've always told my kids \" be a kid as long as you can because you have to be an adult for SO MUCH LONGER\"", "That's  why I'm sure half this stuff is fake.  I've never seen so many posts  of friends  and extended family harassing  any OP .\n\nIf my sister is mad at me, we work it out. She doesn't go whining to our siblings or mother  or her friends", "Lol  don't they make thise Lego kits for adults?  Sone of them look quite complicated and detailed.\nThey can take hours.", "I\u2019m 58 and this year my dear Mom got me AND my wife chocolate Easter bunnies!", "Bot!

Why let go of the things we love in childhood if we don't have to? Why does \"growing up\" have to mean giving up so much fun stuff and getting judged if you don't?", "Absolutely agree"]}
