My sister is close to 7 years younger and as we all got older and she became a teen, our parents considered stopping the easter egg hunt. My sister expressed how she is sad about getting less time of hunting, so I kept hunting into my twenties... and had fun with it, too. \n\nTo this day, our mom still bakes us a special type of sweet bread shaped like a man on the 6th of December and sends out packages to wherever we live - because it was a childhood tradition. We are now 27-35 years old and are still very much happy to receive such a \"childish thing\". \n\nIf it doesn't hurt anyone, why should we stop things that make us happy? \n\nIt annoys me to no end, that some people depend so much on their picture of how things should be, that they forget to consider if the details are really that important. This goes for things like being an adult as much as bein feminine or masculine, successful, professional, whatever. Childish is only a problem, if it keeps a person from being responsible, independent, happy, from things they want or that hurt others. I doubt being happy about childish things fits that description.", "I am a lot older than your daughter and my Aunt still gives me a chocolate bunny for Easter.

OP is generous for making his nephews lil baskets too. he doesn't have to, but he does to see his nephews smile. his sister is a massive and entitled AH. also, the fact that OP's family is siding with the sister and making this a hill to die on does not pass the vibe check. \n\nI agree, OP is not the AH in the slightest.", "Someone needs to take your melon baller away.

Kids will understand sooner or later that their parents arent perfect.", "NTA. \n\nThe thing I would flag, as someone with a mom who is very similar to your sister, is that if she talks about other people's kids that way I can almost guarantee she talks to her own that way (I'd bet decent money Noah didn't grow out of it so much as his mom's belittling of it and griping turned him off it, for example). Please check in with your nephews and be the soft place to land for them as if I'm right, her emotional abuse is not likely to rise to the level that cps would do anything but they'll be affected by it almost certainly. \n\nAn immature parent can be emotionally abusive even if in other ways they're a good person. The two aren't mutually exclusive. You need emotional maturity to be an emotionally healthy parent and it sounds like your sister doesn't have it.", "NTA\n\nSHE was undermining and disrespecting YOU in front if her kids.

I know 20 yr olds who are still happy with it and they don't care what others think.", "NTA\n\nAnyone with empathy and a desire to learn, would realize that someone in foster care isn't there because they wanted to live with other parents like exchanging ugly Christmas sweaters.

I don't know if I'd call what your sister did being immature, more as being stuck up and putting your kiddo down, but you did right by her by shutting that shizz down and letting your sister know it won't be tolerated, as well as showing your daughter you've got her back.
