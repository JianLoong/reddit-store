Much better than dabbling in drinking and drugs like some teens do.", "NTA\n\nSarah was literally trashing talking you, your spouse and your child while simultaneously demanding more gifts for her own children; all in front of her own children. \n\nShe's lucky all she got was some pushback.", "NTA\nKeep up the great job you're doing with your daughter!\nDon't let the other family members bother you too much, they were not there and don't realize how much of an entitled parents sarah was acting like :)", "NTA at all! What a great dad you are!! I\u2019m 25 and still get a basket from my parents for Easter, my favorite candy at Halloween and usually something random my mom thought was funny at thanksgiving. \n\nKeep doing you!", "NTA. Sarah should shut her face hole.", "NTA. It\u2019s none of her business what you buy your daughter. If she wants to celebrate Halloween it\u2019s her choice. Your sister is overstepping especially when her children aren\u2019t entitled to anything from you and she should appreciate what they do get.", "NTA. Sarah's kids are going to grow up thinking the way she talked to you is okay, and it's not. I think it's great they saw you stand up to her bullying. I'm sure they've probably wanted to say something similar to her at some point.", "Sarah wasn't exercising any authority at the time. She was spouting unwelcome nonsense. NTA", "Definitly NTA. You're doing a kind thing making these special treats for her kids too in the first place, she is not entitled to anything extra especially when its a gift. What you give your child is also none of her business. Might not have been the best to say that comment in front of her kids but, it wasn't like you were cursing her out or anything of the sort. \n\nI think its awesome you gave her a Build-A-Bear gift card and as a 17 year old female I wish my parents did these kind of things for me still! You are never too old for stuff animals and its great you guys dote on her while she's still living under your roof.", "NTA\n\nTruth hurts.\n\n\nHonestly she just wanted more for her kids cause she is an entitled brat.\n\nI'd keep her away from madeline.", "NTA\n\nI just sent off Halloween packages to my older kids (and their partners) one is at college and the other is ~30. Their packages included some of their favorite snacks and a gift card. (And extra snacks for sharing for my college kid.) \n\nNo matter how old they are they are still your kids. Little things like this are just nice and make their day a little brighter.", "NTA A Halloween bucket sounds amazing and it's none of your sisters business what you make for your daughter. It sounds as though moving forward your sister can make her own Halloween baskets for her own kids instead of you, because she needs to realise that bullying a teenager even though she wasn't there will not be tolerated by you at all.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said. The only way you would be teaching them that it\u2019s okay to disrespect their mother is if you had disrespected *your* mother; which you didn\u2019t. The fact she went running to others to tattle on you solidifies your point.", "She's 17 and you still make her a bucket ???\nWay to go ,mom\ud83d\ude01    I'm 60 and I would love if someone made  me one.  I would use it to hand out candy \n\nNTA\n\nEdit....you didn't disrespect  her.  You just didn't allow her to disrespect you and your daughter", "NTA\n\nsince when do we grow out if fun. \n\nMy 18 year old still joins in the easter hunt with his young sister (they get maps and bunny feet mark the hiding spots...the presents/eggs specific to each  kid) and he freaking loves it. \n\nGood on you for showing her love.\n\n\nYou were right...your sister needs to grow up. Not to mention the greediness of wanting you not to do stuff for your child so her kids get more! So selfish!", "> undermine Sarah\u2019s authority in front of her own kids \n\nSarah's authority over who? You and how you choose to parent? She doesn't have authority there.\n\n> and basically taught my nephews that it\u2019s okay to disrespect their mother.\n\nAdults speak to each other in ways that children wouldn't/shouldn't and we put our big girl pants on and deal with it like grown ups. That's the teachable moment here, not \"nobody talks to mommy that way\".\n\nNTA.

You taught them a valuable life skill for handling their beloved smother. Also, what authority did you undermine? She was in your house, criticizing you for the gifts you were giving your daughter. She has absolutely no power, influence, or authority in this situation. She should have shut her gob from the first.\n\nFrankly, if her sons laughed at your roasting her like that then it's pretty clear they're hitting the ages already where they become aware their mother, much as they love her, is an embarrassing mess.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Sarah was trying to dictate how you should celebrate a holiday with your family, which is a personal decision and should be respected, and usurp something meant for YOUR child to give to hers.  You were actually quite kind with your response.  She needs to do more than just grow up.", "Telling your sister to stop judging and disrespecting you and your daughter was an important example to set for your nephews, imo. NTA. Sarah seems like a killjoy", "NTA you should have said **\"What i do for my child is my decision and your opinion on the matter doesn't count at all so keep it to yourself\"**", "NTA. I think it\u2019s lovely that you do that. I\u2019m sure it makes her feel loved. My kids are out on their own, and I still send them care packages for Easter and Halloween.", "Nta....my sibs and I were still in our teens and mom was still making our Easter candy table basket....imagine 2 grown almost 20yr olds and a 16 yr old with a giant mid size coffee table decorated with plastic grass and 3 chocolate bunnies lol yup", "NTA \nI don't actually think you disrespected her, you stood up for your kid. She's the one that was setting a bad example for her kids by being ungrateful for the gifts you'd given and feeling entitled to more. You're right, she does need to grow up.", "NTA. Because you enhanced the message: 'we love our daughter and want to show it to her', she ave the message: 'when you grow up you don't deserve that much love/fun anymore, and there is only one proper way to feel'. With your words you might be the good influence in her kids life.", "NTA this is so sweet! I love that you all so got a card for build a bear. I went as an adult and got a light fury plushy I named Toothpaste.", "Sarah hasn't grown up, and if her kids follow her example, they won't, either.\n\nSo you needed to step in and parent your nephews when their mother wouldn't by calling out immature behavior on the part of their mother.\n\nDef NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The year I turned 30, I went to build a bear with my niece (turning 6) and we built together (with other family too) because our birthdays are 5 days apart. It was fun! I also rode the mall carousel that day with the kids. They loved me joining in their fun! Some \"adults\" take themselves too seriously. Build Legos! Play boardgames!

Nice move", "NTA, I did that kind of thing to my BFF with her kids their entire lives. I would talk to her kids, ask questions about whatever and my friend would answer, I called her out every time. Her son thanked me later, that he\u2019d never seen anyone shut her down like I did, and it was glorious. Your nephews will always remember that you didn\u2019t entertain their mothers words and behavior. And that if she ever goes off the rails, they can come to you for help in dealing with her", "NTA. You have a sweet tradition with your daughter that is hurting literally NO ONE. Why should you stop just because your sister is being a jealous little brat? You sound like an awesome dad. Also, I\u2019m 41 and still love Build a Bear, and I am FAR from alone in that. If she still likes plushies then good for her!

There is a difference between refusing to be disrespected and being disrespectful.
