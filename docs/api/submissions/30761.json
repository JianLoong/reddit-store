Is it something you can help him with, maybe gym/walk/cycle/swim together?", "NTA, Tell him to run a few T&T cycles, come back shredded and with atrophied balls, and then have sex with the muscular Demi-god you deserve.", "NTA, you can't force attraction just to be polite or PC.\n\nAnd how can it ever improve if you won't talk about it?\n\n\nYou're just gonna HAVE to risk hurting his feelings.  After all, it's in his interest too that this gets sorted out.\n\nBut it's important to frame it as *Us Together versus His Weight Problem*, not  as *You versus Mr Fat Bastard*.\n\nGood luck", "Esh - ok so this is how you are.  Hopefully you never find yourself in a situation where you gain weight and a man you love no longer wants you.  My husband was extremely thin and had good diet and exercise habits.  After an accident impacting his knees he does not have the same physical fitness and now struggles - despite great efforts and working with therapists - to maintain a healthy weight.  Imagine how he would feel if I no longer wanted a physically intimate relationship as a result.  We get older, get ill, things out of our control happen.  Let's hope none of these things ever happen to you...", "NAH\n\nyou cannot control you sexual attraction, you cannot control what turns you on or off, just like your spouse cannot control his libido.\n\nhaving said that - you both need to be sensitive and empathetic when discussing this as this subject tends to be sensitive", "NAH - You are never the AH for how you feel, it's important that you tell him how you feel. Not just for intimacy but for his health", "NTA- you can\u2019t be the asshole for feeling the way you do. It comes down to how you express it though!", "so , is it \"crucial\", or will he just feel unappreciated.   Hello, he is unappreciated so his feelings are correct.  He should get off the couch and lose some weight, even if only for his personal health.", "At a certain point you have to be honest. Honesty is always best, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable. Maybe suggest a shared activity that can help with weight loss, or make more healthy food for dinner. I hope you guys figure it out \ud83e\udd19", "Be compassionate and understanding about his needs while honestly sharing your own struggles. Encourage a supportive and collaborative approach to find solutions.", "Nah\n\nAnimals are reflexively repulsed by signs of poor health, and significant weight gain is a symptom of many things.", "NTA daily intimacy is an unrealistic expectation, as is putting on significant weight and not expecting any social response. As a guy who also has a high sex drive, I\u2019ve used what I guess you could call \u201creluctance\u201d from partners as an indicator that I\u2019m doing something wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve fallen into the thinking pattern of \u201cshe won\u2019t be considerate of my desires and have sex with me so I\u2019m not improving myself\u201d when the reality was she wouldn\u2019t have sex with me because I wasn\u2019t considering her desires and improving myself.\n\nHope that makes sense but in my experience once that cause-effect loop is recognized it\u2019s way easier to attack it from an \u201cus vs. the problem\u201d perspective instead of a \u201cme vs. you\u201d thing. \n\nSo I\u2019m assuming the extended period with no intimacy is probably making him wonder if there\u2019s something about him that\u2019s turning you off. It\u2019s better to be honest sooner rather than later or never. If that makes him angry rather than motivated to change and keep you in his life, that should tell you enough to re-evaluate your commitment.", "NAH.\n\nHe can't be the AH for gaining weight especially if he does not know how that affects you.\n\nYou can't be the AH for \"feeling\" something, because that's just there.\n\nI think you both need to talk.
