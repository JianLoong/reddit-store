Often enough he wants to vent or think through something out loud and is ok with me half-listening.

She could have a serious medical condition or it might be part of who she is.\n\nSome people live inside their own heads. If she's that type of person and that bothers you, you better break up ASAP because it won't change.  Sometimes one's inner world is more interesting than what's going on outside the self.  This happens often with creative people. Writers, artists, musicians.  It won't change.  My family is often overheard saying (about me), \"There she goes again. Off in her own little writing world.\"  And that's exactly where I am because the external world is a snooze fest sometimes.  This is really one of those love it or leave it kinds of things. If she's someone who lives inside herself - that may be just who she is. It's not that she's trying to be intentionally rude. It just happens. You get bored - you end up daydreaming.\n\nWhen she said the conversation was boring, at least she was being honest. I mean, my eyes glaze over when my husband starts speaking tech just as his eyes glaze over when I start talking about botany or finances.  I have to work REALLY HARD to listen to tech-speak for more than five minutes at a time. Everyone has that one topic they will react this way to.  And expecting people to pretend to be excited about a dull conversation will only last so long before boredom sets in. The solution here is break up, or try to avoid boring topics. Or give yourself boring topic allowances.\n\nFinally - does she have something stressful or important on her mind? Sometimes, anxiety, worry, and stress can cause us to focus on that instead of what's going on around us. There could be a legit stress factor she's dealing with right now. Some people deal with situations like this by going inward.\n\nNo matter what the cause, if this is a deal breaker for you - it's best she know now before the relationship goes further.", "Its pretty difficult so I\u2019m not going to pass my Wisdom on, however she may have a medical condition that is causing these zone outs so possibly schedule an appointment with the a doctor.
