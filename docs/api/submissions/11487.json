Often enough he wants to vent or think through something out loud and is ok with me half-listening.

She could have a serious medical condition or it might be part of who she is.\n\nSome people live inside their own heads. If she's that type of person and that bothers you, you better break up ASAP because it won't change.  Sometimes one's inner world is more interesting than what's going on outside the self.  This happens often with creative people. Writers, artists, musicians.  It won't change.  My family is often overheard saying (about me), \"There she goes again. Off in her own little writing world.\"  And that's exactly where I am because the external world is a snooze fest sometimes.  This is really one of those love it or leave it kinds of things. If she's someone who lives inside herself - that may be just who she is. It's not that she's trying to be intentionally rude. It just happens. You get bored - you end up daydreaming.\n\nWhen she said the conversation was boring, at least she was being honest. I mean, my eyes glaze over when my husband starts speaking tech just as his eyes glaze over when I start talking about botany or finances.  I have to work REALLY HARD to listen to tech-speak for more than five minutes at a time. Everyone has that one topic they will react this way to.  And expecting people to pretend to be excited about a dull conversation will only last so long before boredom sets in. The solution here is break up, or try to avoid boring topics. Or give yourself boring topic allowances.\n\nFinally - does she have something stressful or important on her mind? Sometimes, anxiety, worry, and stress can cause us to focus on that instead of what's going on around us. There could be a legit stress factor she's dealing with right now. Some people deal with situations like this by going inward.\n\nNo matter what the cause, if this is a deal breaker for you - it's best she know now before the relationship goes further.", "Its pretty difficult so I\u2019m not going to pass my Wisdom on, however she may have a medical condition that is causing these zone outs so possibly schedule an appointment with the a doctor.

I'm also hard of hearing, so when I'm concentrating on something like a book or even my phone, and he doesn't get my attention before he starts talking,  I don't realise he is talking to me. During this time, he used to think I was just ignoring him. It got to the point that it made him feel so shit that he cried. My husband isn't a cryer. He will cry, but it's not a common occurrence.  I didn't do it on purpose, but  I made him feel so disrespected he cried! I felt like the biggest peace of shit ever. \n\nNow, if he's talking to me after getting my attention, I put my phone down or pause what I'm watching.\n\nHe also understands that he needs to get my attention before speaking to me and has accepted that I wasn't ignoring him when I do this. \n\nOthers are right. There may be an underlying medical issue, but as it stands right now, there has been no diagnosis, so your reaction was understandable.", "You are TA.

You should apologize. I can give you advice on what works for me to keep my attention because I also have ADHD but it's only really going to work for the inattentive of combined type so start off saying her name- DO NOT Start talking until she looks you in the eyes, if she doesn't look over at you within a minute, say her name again and ask if she could listen to what you have to say- nicely. If she glance back over at what she's doing, don't keep talking, she has stopped listening. If she's doing something and can't pull her attention away, then wait until she stops to use the bathroom or eat. You're not going to be able to pull her away from that task, she is in hyper focus mode.   \n\n\nAlso try getting to the point of things, My husband loves to talk about work and I love listening but he constantly gives too much detail. I do not care about what kind of bolt goes into the leg of a metal bar at the end of some random hallway on some random floor in some random building. that has nothing to do with why dave got fired today.   \n\n\nPeople like to think about ADHD as not being able to pay attention, but it's not just that, you can also pay too much attention to things.

What were you saying again?", "Mega YTA", "YTA", "You sure you're not the girlfriend?", "YTA. There could be bigger issue then just zoning out, like others said it could be some serious medical issues or it could he just that her brain gets overwhelmed and needs time to reset itself, I zone out often especially if I have too much information thrown at me at one time I zone out and sometimes loose 1+ hour of information, it's not fun at all, the way I describe zoning out the way I have it is if you download loads of apps or games or anything onto your PlayStation/computer/phone then at some point that device will freeze up until you restart it, and that's how it is for me, and it's not easy to control it, as annoying as it is for you it's as annoying for her. My advice is to get her to the doctors to see if its a medical issue and for ways to learn to snap out of zoning out quicker and maybe in the mean time try finding out things that can help her get out of the zoning out before you get to see the doctor, maybe something like changing the topic of conversation to something she enjoys or asking her questions about different topics and see if that works as sometimes just a simple topic change can work or even just going outside for a little bit", "YTA, and boring.", "YTA\n\nShe's stated she can't control it, someone wanting her to control an uncomfortable thing isn't actually going to make the situation better!

I work in healthcare and I know that ALOT of specialties, especially like therapists, psychiatrists, etc, are VERY difficult to get into and usually have VERY LONG waitlists. \nHOW is that her fault? You used her medical condition to embarrass her in front of YOUR family, and then shamed her more and yelled at her for it on your way home?\n\nEdit to add: Also, she probably IS sorry for doing it, already gets embarrassed enough for it without your comments about it and then yelling at her for it, but again there is NOTHING she can do about it except for apologize until she can see someone for it. But when she does apologize you yell at her and make her feel worse about it.

I used to work in the disability field. One of the people the company supported had absence seizures so I did a lot of research into them. It comes across as someone 'zoning out' or even daydreaming.

I'm extremely paranoid a out any time my kids zone out though.", "I have had two positive EEGs for seizure activity but a shady neurologist who swept it under the rug so I could continue driving.. which I can\u2019t do because I zone out like this when I drive.", "\u201czoning out\u201d isn\u2019t inherently a seizure! but it\u2019s a huge sign you should see a doc no matter what. if it\u2019s happening very often, i\u2019d go to a doc and then a neuro for sure to get to the bottom of what\u2019s going on. could be adhd, dissociation, a sleeping disorder or epilepsy! or even multiple of those things", "What? No. Her husband is one of them.", "Thank you for the way you are working with her. It really helps them with their confidence in other situations. Also helps them have words to explain what happened. \n\nI worked at a school and really tried to help the kids with this type of thing.  Good job.", "That explanation is too adorable for words!", "This is wonderful and I'm totally stealing it from now on. Whenever everyone asks me where I went mentally I'll just tell them I was chasing sheep.", "This is absolutely the cutest. You're winning at parenting, fyi.", "Need that on a folder. Lol.", "This is absolutely precious \ud83d\udc95", "how did you get her to refocus?\n\nmy son lately has been doing this. i don't want to do medicine because he's on some other meds that could have some nasty side effects. \n\nhe definitely does this more when he's had red 40, i know i sound like a crazy, granola crunchy hippie but we accidentally did this controlled experiment on vaca  last year where he had it, couldn't sit and eat and then the next night didn't and could sit and eat. \ud83d\ude02", "I mean.. it's not called woolgathering for nothing :)", "Thanks!", "what are you talking about?\n\nADHD is helped with medication, but also the environment plays a large role. I have many friends with ADHD who don't use medication and find in highly stimulating environments where a lot is going on they have no issue paying attention. It's when there is an absence of stimulation that they struggle. Granted some find it to be true the other way, and I've heard it said often that people with ADHD have a much narrower band of optimal stimulation  \n\n\nAbsence seizures are your brain going haywire with a feedback loop of electrical activity more or less paralysing parts of your brain. Medications can help prevent this. Its unlikely to be dangerous unless you have a severe form of epilepsy, although still something that needs investigating. The risk with absence seizures is they can happen at the worst times (crossing the road, driving a car etc.) with little to no warning. So in that sense yes you can die, but the chance of dropping dead from them directly is very very low", "Ah! In that case yeah, maybe get that checked out lol. I misread your original comment as you getting a negative result for seizure activity, and i wanted to hop in because theres a lot of people on this thread jumping to seizures. Which is obviously a possibility for op\u2019s gf, but as someone with ADHD, and who dissociates with migraines (and i think at other times, though its uh\u2026 hard to tell lol), i wanted to point out that there were other options. \n\nSorry!", ">The biggest hurdle people with disorders have? Not enough support.\n\nExactly. Oh plenty of people *claim* they're supportive when they actually aren't.", "Yeah that is definitely a rare thing to occur lol. It may not be rare for a disease but 1 in 1600 people makes it very uncommon for a random person to have it. It\u2019s .06%", "But it's not just her SO.", "Of course it isn't."]}
