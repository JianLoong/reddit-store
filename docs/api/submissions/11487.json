That she has to guard herself and change her behaviour around you, even if she can't help it. Trust has been broken. So yes, YTA. There is an issue, but anger isn't the answer.", "I do this. It\u2019s disassociating. I literally don\u2019t know it\u2019s happened until I come out of it. There are techniques to help but it can be exhausting always trying to stay present when I mentally just need a little break.", "Info: are you having a conversation or just talking at her without letting her talk at all?

Took me years to get diagnosed.\n\nFrom my perspective: YTA.

We can create a whole world in our heads for fun. \n\n\nYou say she does it during long conversations. Are you the only one taking the whole time? Do you ask her questions? Is the conversation very one sided? Do you ramble on during your conversations?", "YTA.\n\nYou're berating her over what you yourself suspect is a neurologic condition", "I think yelling at her may have been too extreme. I also do this and have ADHD and even with medication I zoned out. I cannot help it no matter how hard I try. I could be on a roller coaster and zone out \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d. I wouldn\u2019t be so hard on her, it\u2019s not personal.", "YTA\n\nUntil the moment comes where she is told that she DOESN'T have ADHD (or something of the sort), you need to accept this is who she is. It's quite possible there's nothing she can do about it.... So if you can't handle it, end the relationship.... If not, suck it up and deal with it!", "You think your girlfriend has an incurable attention disorder that she has yet to be treated for\u2026and you say she can\u2019t just expect you to be cool with it when that disorder presents.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. It sounds like she can\u2019t control it, thinks it may be ADHD, and is looking for solutions for it. What more are you expecting from her?

There\u2019s a likelihood that she may have something like ADHD which means she cannot help it but your having a go at her?? Jeez dude.", "YTA. Here's why. There's two possible reasons why this is happening.\n\nPossible reason 1: She has a neurological issue that's out of her control. In which case, YTA for getting angry.\n\nPossible reason 2: You're the sort of person who will drone on and on and on and bloody ON forever about things, because you're narcissistic and need to have a captive audience as you drone and drone and drone... in which case YTA and need to learn about the give and take of conversation.\n\n(Since she says your conversation is boring, my bet is on reason 2, but I can't be certain.)", "She's told you that what you are saying is boring.....why does she need a Dr to tell her anything?

She could also be experiencing dissociation, which can happen for any number of reasons. If this is something that's having a negative impact on her daily life, then she definitely needs to find help as soon as possible.", "INFO Have you tried being more interesting?", "Yta.  You can't suggest she have ADHD and then tell her to get it under control.", "YTA. She may have a medical condition like Absence Seizures, I have these and it often looks like I'm zoning out but I have no control over it. It might be worth her going to the doctor. You should be more understanding and try to help her, you should apologize.", "YTA. Do you ever talk about anything she\u2019s interested in? Does that change if she zones out?", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2018s not personal, it\u2018s very likely a mental condition.

There is no way to \u201cgain control of it\u201d. I \u201czone out\u201d due to flashbacks/trauma. I dissociate. I have literally no control over when it happens and I am so glad I have a partner who actually realises this and doesn\u2019t take it as a personal slight. Work with her instead of against her. There are so many reasons for \u201czoning out\u201d and even after a cause is found? It can take years to get even remotely under control - if it can actually get under control depending on the underlying issues.", "I\u2019m sure yelling will scared the adhd right out of her good idea! You\u2019re angry ? imagine how she must feel. She\u2019s zoning out completely out of her control and then being yelled at by the person that should be nurturing her and helping her with coping mechanisms to pay attention if you care about her as deeply as you claim in your follow up comments. Don\u2019t make her feel like a burden for something she can\u2019t control.", "YTA. Don't yell.\n\nUntil you have evidence it's a behaviour she can control ad opposed to a medical condition, you shouldn't even be getting annoyed.", "Really long conversations\nAnd\nTalk about my day.\nReally?

She needs to figure this out.", "YTA,  she may have ADD and  you may be long winded and boring going on about yourself.    The fact that you showed contempt for her is total AH.", "YTA.

You overreacted. Apologize.", "YTA \n\nThis could be caused by anyone of a few things including ADHD and seizures. I have ADHD and still zone out with medication. Your girlfriend should see a GP to start, it can take a while to get in to see a specialist.\n\nYou owe her a huge apology and need to show her empathy.", "YTA and your head is so far up your own. Pull it out and realise nobody has to be zoned into life at all times. You aren't that special.", "YTA. There\u2019s no need to yell at her over something like this", "It's understandable that you feel frustrated when your girlfriend zones out during conversations, but yelling at her and putting pressure on her to get it \"under control\" was not the best way to handle the situation. It's important to remember that she may have a legitimate medical condition and is actively seeking help by trying to make an appointment with a therapist.\r  \n\r  \nInstead of blowing up at her, you could have expressed your feelings calmly and asked how you can support her in seeking treatment. It's also important to remember that ADHD can be difficult to manage, and it may take time for her to find a treatment plan that works for her.\r  \n\r  \nIt's good that you recognize your behavior was not appropriate and that you feel bad about it. You could apologize to your girlfriend and let her know that you understand that it's not her fault and that you're there to support her. It's important to communicate and work through these issues together as a team.", "YTA, and I think you know you screwed up. Apologize to her and help her find a therapist. This is an opportunity for you to learn from a mistake and be a better partner.", "YTA  \nI get the frustration but if it is a medical condition,as you suspect, then she doesn't have control over it. And you yelling at her accomplishes nothing. \n\nYour gf should probably have a full medical checkup not just with her therapist. \n\nIf after all that, and there is nothing medically wrong and she's just zoning out whenever she finds things boring then you have reason to be upset because she can control that.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nShe might have an issue that she is trying to get checked and even if she doesn't you don't get to yell at people\n\nAccept her or leave her", "NAH. Tensions rose and I wouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, but it is understandable that you\u2019d be frustrated with someone who often isn\u2019t engaged in your conversations. I would apologize for raising your voice, and express how it feels when she zones out during your interactions.

Can we take a break and pick it up again in 5 minutes?\" Sometimes when my partner talks about something at work and it's a long story with a lot of details I let him know that I'm having trouble catching all the details and if it's a story where the details are important or if it's ok to listen with the mental capacity that I have. Often enough he wants to vent or think through something out loud and is ok with me half-listening. If details are important I may ask him to tell me later when I have more capacity to listen.\n\nReversely, my partner talks to be about it when he notices. He might say, \"I notice you're not quite here\" and wrap his story up quickly. If there's something specific he still wants to talk about, we can pick it up again later.
