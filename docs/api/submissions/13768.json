The family is getting pretty amped up & excited & the wedding is a hot topic whenever we get together.\n\nMy older step sister (34) & I have a strained but civil relationship. Honestly, it's pretty much her fault. She abused me while we grew up because she resented me taking any of her dad's attention. Things are a lot better now, but I doubt we'll ever be friends, or close. Point is we have a well known family history of not getting along well, & it especially upsets our dad.\n\nSo, the issue: I make an effort to interact with her when we see each other & also on social media, because she's expressed that's what she prefers. On Tuesday she shared a chain post on Facebook of a cute little pudgy cartoon bat, flapping in some shiny stars. The bat made me smile & the stars made me think of the song twinkle twinkle, so I liked the post & commented the words 'twinkle twinkle little bat, how I love that you're so fat' with a silly face emoji, a heart &some stars. I hit send & kept scrolling. It was utterly benign, no deeper than what it appeared.\n\nAFEW MINUTES later I get a notif that she tried to post something directly to my profile page. It was a ranty, passive aggressive paragraph about how I shouldn't think it's funny to poke fun at people's insecurities & that if I was a grown enough woman to get married then I should be grown enough not to bully. I have my profile settings so that nothing gets posted to my page without my approval. She didn't know that, I guess. I stared at it mouth agape for a while. I had no idea what had brought this on. Then my dad's phone rings upstairs. It's my sister. She's BAWLING & furious. Why? Apparently, the comment I wrote about the fat little bat was ACTUALLY me making a dig at her because she's obese.\n\nShe IS obese. But I have never & would never say anything mean about it. I abhor fat shaming. So when my parents asked me wtf was going on, I was honest & told them I didn't know, & she was mistaken. My dad tried to relay this information, but she wasn't having it & wouldn't believe me or him. Then she said that the attention from the wedding just must not be enough for me, I had to go putting her down, too. \n\nAt the mention of the wedding I just kind of snapped, the planning has been very stressful and I'm already chronically depressed & have had a bad year. So I just held my hand out for the phone, said to her 'dont worry about the wedding, you're uninvited. I don't need people there who think so little of my character', and hung up. Then I said sorry to mom & dad for the fuss, & went back to my room.\n\nShe of course called right back & started shrieking about how dare I disrespect her like that. She said I was being a dramatic bitch & an asshole for attention. My dad is sad & frustrated about the whole thing & I know he wants me to let her apologise & reinvite her, but I'm standing my ground. my mom & fiance agree with me. AITA?\n\nEdit because some ppl are saying I was making a fat joke: I definitely wasn't. I was just trying to twist a cute little rhyme to fit the cute little bat. The bat was fat, and those words rhyme. It wasn't any deeper than that. Her body was the furthest thing from my mind when I commented on the cute bat picture. As I stated plainly, I do not body shame\n\nEdit - my takeaway from this is that people think I'm an asshole for saying the word fat, on a piece of media that was reposted by a person who happens to be fat. That's actually really fat phobic of you. I have been called a liar, an asshole, a bitch, shallow, immature, a baby, a trashy idiot, a moron, and other things, all because you either didn't read the whole post, can't comprehend that what I typed was not a \"fat joke\", or just think I'm lying.

I also think your sister way overreacted.\n\nBut you overreacted and went to the nuclear option and told her she just wasn\u2019t invited to your wedding. And I can even understand that in the moment when somebody is screaming at you.

Her reaction is absolutely understandable.", "YTA. You may have not MEANT it as a fat joke against her but that just shows you have a massive lack of awareness in relation to others. At the end of the day this is one of those \u2018impact over intent\u2019 situations and the impact of your - frankly flabbergastingly tone deaf and insightless comment - is that she felt mocked and humiliated in public.", "Hmm I think this one\u2019s tough, kinda interested to see how people will vote here. I\u2019m going NTA. I think it\u2019s clear your rhyme was about the bat, not her. You were also praising the bat for being fat, not using the word fat as an insult. She seems to be projecting a whole lotta stuff on you just for using the word fat, which is unfair. But I also think it\u2019s not wholly unpredictable that an obese person would have baggage over the word \u201cfat\u201d no matter how you use it. I probably wouldn\u2019t have made a joke like that to an obese person unless I know they\u2019re the type who wants to reclaim/destigmatize the word fat. I don\u2019t think that part makes you an AH, I just personally would think twice about that in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s okay for her to have negative feelings, but she didn\u2019t express them in a healthy way or give you any room to respond. I almost put E S H because of the \u201cI don\u2019t need people who think so little of my character\u201d comment\u2026 I really hate  it when people receive feedback that something was offensive, and their response is \u201cHow could you think I\u2019d ever do that? I\u2019m obviously not [insert offensive thing here, racist/sexist/fatphobic etc]\u201d. Like, okay, then explain to me what you meant! And then I can explain how it came off to me, and ideally both of us can apologize for the confusion and move forward. So my initial vibe was that you\u2019re doing that, just saying \u201cI would never fatshame\u201d without explaining what you intended and making amends for hurting her feelings (I still think it\u2019s nice to say sorry and that doing so isn\u2019t an admission of guilt). But on a second read I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. It sounds like you tried to explain your intentions, but she\u2019s straight up saying you\u2019re lying and you DID intend to mock her. That\u2019s not okay.\n\nI personally would hold out for an acknowledgement from her that she recognizes you had no intentions of mocking her. If she can admit that, then I think it\u2019d be kind to apologize for unintentionally hurting her feelings. I wouldn\u2019t apologize or reinvite without an acknowledgment that the slight was unintentional. If you do, the situation will get locked in in her mind as \u201cthat time my sister totally fat shamed me\u201d and she\u2019ll never admit to any of the nuance of what actually happened.", "NTA. I mean OP did make a fat joke but it was about a cartoon bat. Anyone offended by it who isn't a cartoon bat is just doing so b/c they think the entire world and everything people say revolves around them.", "All of the people saying you're TA are ridiculous. You made a cutesy rhyme about a fat cartoon bat. Your super sensitive step-sister used it as an opportunity to lash out and talk shit about your wedding AND your character. NTA and good riddance. Honestly, she'd probably try to make a scene at your wedding if you reinvited her anyway.", "In complete respect and meaning this from the heart, you appear to have a lot of growing up to do. It seems you\u2019ve harbored a grudge against her that you can\u2019t let go of, and try to push it off on her. You also seem to be making this about you (chronically depressed, hard year), when the issue is about her. If you two have a strained relationship as it is, sending that comment and knowing it upset her, why didn\u2019t you just apologize and listen to her, instead of fly off the handle and hit the sport mode button? YTA", "NTA, as an obese person, if I posted a chubby bat and someone said something about it, I would not assume (because assumptions make you an ass) that it was directed at me. Sounds like the sister is just insecure and has a lot of issues to begin with. If anything, she should have come to you and politely asked for clarification.\n\nAnd for people thinking OP's humor is \"weird\", it's really not. That's how people joke around these days. Stupid rhymes and dumb memes for everything.", "NTA - to me the comment was pretty clearly about the bat and the only one being dramatic is her.\n\nThat said, if she is trying to apologize I do think you should let her. This isn't worth sinking your relationship forever if she is prepared to admit she was wrong. And then I do think you would be kind to say that you're sorry the comment hurt her, that wasn't your intent and you'll try to be more thoughtful about language that might be triggering for her.", "YTA. What you wrote was kind of weird?", "NTA. I\u2019m overweight and it was clear you were talking about the bat from what I read", "NTA.  She sounds like my sister: always looking for a self-perceived 'slight' that she can twist to make drama.  Unnecessary and exhausting.   GUARANTEED she would find something to create drama about at your wedding.  You are in no way, shape or form required to invite someone just because she's FAAAAAAMMMMMMMILY.  Good bye and good riddance.  Ridiculous.  She might be 34 but is acting like a child.\n\nETA:  you do not need to be around anyone that you have to police your words all the time.  Walking on eggshells because they are looking to react to something you said, whispered, sang, repeated from a show/podcast, SIGHED AT........Google 'Rock The Boat'.  This is what brought family sounds like: Wanting to placate the oldest", "YTA. She sounds like a piece of work,  but the fat bat thing. Come on. It would be one thing if the insecurity was something not visible to the eye or so obscure not many people know about the condition, but obesity fits neither of that criteria. I fully support not having her at your wedding, but this downward spiraling of events seems to have been kicked off by you.", "ESH - you don't post \"fat\" on an obese persons FB page even if you think it's a cute picture,  you just say \"cute!\".     \n\nThen you go \" I have depression and a hard year\".     Honey,  with covid and inflation etc,  many of us have mental health challenges.   I don't mean to invalidate it but it's no reason to say \"I don't need to be civil anymore\".   I have those issues too and if anything it's made me conscientious to have more empathy.\n\nThen you go nuclear on here which is going to cause stress with the family.    But she called you a bitch and an asshole.    It's a mess.\n\nEveryone sucks.", "YTA. You could have used your words to defuse the situation but instead chose to throw gasoline on the fire.", "NTA. You made a joke over a cartoon bat. She took it the wrong way. That\u2019s not on you. She clearly thinks the world has to bend over backwards to cater to her insecurities.", "NTA you made a comment about the post itself. Her reaction would be more understandable if OP posted it directly to her wall and not on a post with a fat bat in it. I am also obese but I would never automatically assume someone is calling me fat on a post with a fat animal on it. The sister is reading way too much into it because she is so insecure.", "NTA, however you at the very least lack tactfulness.", "NTA you made a damm rhyme. I have seen a picture similar posted on social media. But I have to say your rhyme was cute.\n\nAnd it's your sister's responsibility to learn how to deal with her own triggers.", "ESH. Given your already strained relationship, you should have thought for a long moment before posting anything on the photo. I think it's reasonable for your step-sister to think you were making a jab at her. And if you had thought for a long moment, you would have realized how she might take it. So.\n\nBut your stepsister should have talked to you like a rational human being and not jumped to conclusions.\n\nAt which point, you should have apologized, sincerely.\n\nAnd then there wouldn't be a need to involve the wedding.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour sister, and her insecurities, sounds exhausting. Not your responsibility to babysit her on top of everything else that you have on your plate right now.\n\nI disagree with the posts that say you need to tip toe around the fact that your step sister is obese. The reason why this happened is because it did not even cross your mind to consider your step sister's obesity -- it is so not an issue for you. \n\nAnd now these posters think you are in the wrong for not stopping to think about how your interactions may be *mistakenly* construed by your obese step sister?! No, your step sister's obesity is not your problem. Ain't nobody got time for that tip toe-ing around shit.", "She sounds fucking exhausting NTA", "I\u2019m going with NTA. I\u2019m fat and the last thing I\u2019d think is that it\u2019s a dig against me.", "so YTA since you insulted her. You knew or should have known she would not think your words were only about the character. You probably don't want her at the wedding and you probably resent her for the past abuse, perhaps rightfully so. Sometimes these things just come out whether we consciously mean them to or not. You are not required to be a saint OP and have the right to your feelings.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding. I sincerely hope you enjoy your big day and that things go better for you without your sister there.", "YTA \"how I love you you're so fat\". If you knew she was obese then why did you say that? I know you meant no harm but a lot of fat people are very sensitive to that. Next time think more carefully of your words.", "YTA So if you didn't mean it as an insult, why were you not mortified that you had hurt your step-sister's feelings when you read that message? If I accidentally insult someone, and they tell me so, I apologize, even if that wasn't my intention, because intentions don't matter. Only impact matters, and the impact your little comment had was bringing your step-sister to tears. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. \n\nAlso, quit pretending you're the victim. People who try to reverse the situation like this are invariably the worst. It's not an insult to your character to take offense at your words, you owe her an apology, not the other way around.", "NTA imo", "YTA. You made a tactless remark on her FB page. Utterly tactless, and you know it. And instead of trying to diffuse the situation, you go nuclear with your wedding. Seriously?!? You are the person who sounds exhausting.

Mean girls are not something to strive towards.", "You put fat on your obese sisters social media. YTA", "ESH. I think she did overreact, TBH, but also- intent and impact aren't the same thing. I believe you when you made the comment without intending it to be about her. However, your words hurt her. Owning the impact is important. I think uninviting her seems rather nuclear.", "YTA-\n\nFor sending your \u201cobese\u201d sister a song about being fat\u2026\u2026 then victimizing yourself for making a \u201cmindless mistake\u201d.

You had to have known it\u2019s a sensitive topic, and it sounds like you snapped on her due to stress from things that had nothing to do with her. However, full AH to your sister for so obviously projecting and trying to turn it into you somehow needing more attention (sounds like jealousy on her part). Wedding planning is stressful as hell - I had a full breakdown and quit my job before my wedding because it was just too much (I had other issues going on too, but still). Ultimately, it\u2019s your wedding, and it\u2019s on you to decide if you want to either try to amend things and/or accept an apology from her if she tried to give you one, or not.
