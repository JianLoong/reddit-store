Second, NTA. You already work 1-2 times a week. You are definitely allowed to have a couple days off to paint and study. I think you should have a couple days off.", "NTA, communicate exactly that. You need to prioritize your education.", "NTA - she has multiple sitters, so she can ask another one of them for additional time when you say no. You have important academic work to complete. If she doesn't understand, and/or gets pissy, that tells you something about her as a person.", "NTA. Your first job is looking after all of your own stuff.  It\u2019s ok if you put yourself first. You don\u2019t even have to babysit AT ALL if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s the mom\u2019s responsibility to figure out her life. Use your free choice and have no guilt.", "NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t tell her *soon.*", "NTA.  School should be your priority right now, and it is entirely appropriate to set boundaries on how much you work to make sure you can get your schoolwork done.", "NTA. You are young. And should have time to enjoy your youth.  You'll have to enter the workforce soon enough. No reason you should feel pressure to work more now.", "Nta! You need to do what you need to do!", "NAH it's fine to have limits and these are very reasonable. Also long term school is more of a priority. Although I don't think she is an asshole for asking.", "NTA. She has multiple other sitters. You should not be putting your studies or life on hold to babysit another person\u2019s child. S should understand that and be thankful for the times you can babysit. I say this as a single father. I would never want any of my family( only people I trust to babysit) to put their school or jobs behind watching my child.", "NTA as its just a job and you help out if you can. Have a conversation with her as she might be able to find other sitters. Its not your responsibility to worry about everything as you have your life to focus upon. Do help out if you can but don't let it make you feel guilty if you are unable to.", "NAH. You could let her know ahead of time what your availability is like and she can work around it. You never agreed to babysit daily so you're absolutely in the clear here. Sounds like 2-3 days per week would be helping out more, which is what you agreed to, and still gets you two days off. School is a priority and it's good that you are thinking about how to manage your time and not take on more than you can handle.", "NTA. It sounds like you are plenty busy with school. That right there is a good enough reason to tell her NO.", "NTA. Tell her now so she can make arrangements.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
