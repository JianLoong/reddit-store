My mom found out and pulled out divorce papers. My father payed child support but he was never around growing up. I asked my mom as a little girl who my father was but she didn\u2019t like talking about it but she told me the story when I was 14. My response to her was that I would never reach out to my father and I was perfectly happy having her as my only parent.\n\nNow I\u2019m 19. I still don\u2019t have the desire to have any relationship with my father. However, my father\u2019s brother reached out to me on Instagram after finding my account. He didn\u2019t say much. Just that he knew how much of a piece of crap his brother is and that he wishes me luck in life. I ended up chatting back and forth with him until we finally met in person. I won\u2019t talk about the meeting but he convinced me that perhaps it\u2019s a good idea to meet my younger half siblings. This would mean meeting my father and his wife. But I decided to do it anyway. My uncle arranges for me to spend spring break over with my father and his family. I arrive at their house. I\u2019m greeted at the door by one of my half-brothers who takes me inside and guides me to the dining room where my father and his wife are seated. My father stands up. Opening his arms preparing for a hug. I offer a handshake instead. I sit down and I have a conversation with both of them. Before having a serious conversation, they want to wait till the evening when the kids are supposed to go to their friend\u2019s house so we could be alone. I agree. Evening rolls around. Father drops the kids off at their friends house. He comes back and I have dinner with his wife. Lots of things were discussed. They didn\u2019t try to white wash or deny the fact that my dad cheated on my mom with his wife. They admitted it openly. I expected the opposite to happen but I was proven wrong. Then I talk about myself. Then they about themselves and their kids. Dinner ends. I go up to the guest room they prepped for me. Minutes later my father\u2019s wife comes up and knocks on the door. I tell her to come in. She asks me what I think of everything. Her, their house,  her kids. I say that everything is cool. To which she responds with \u201cbe honest.\u201d I said \u201cok. I\u2019m very hurt at the fact my father treated my mother the way he did because of you. The fact he gave you everything but barely anything to me or her. I can\u2019t really have a negative opinion of her kids. She leaves the room. Later my father comes up. Asks angrily I told his wife. Apparently I made her cry I said \u201cwhat she wanted to hear. My honest thoughts.\u201d Somehow I\u2019m the bad person for it.\n\nForgive any possible spelling mistakes. English isn\u2019t my first language. I also left out some details because otherwise I would be typing for hours. It wasn\u2019t as simple as my uncle convincing me.\n\nAnyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1679845767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122qfji/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_wife_how_i_really_feel/", "score": 840, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad seems to want to gloss over your feelings without deeply apologizing for the hurt he caused you and your mom; your stepmom, to her credit, actually put herself out there and is doing some of the emotional processing regarding their decision to abandon you and your mom, and if she's crying for how she treated you, that's okay. It is healthy for us to experience shame when we have done things to be ashamed of.

Well, I suppose that tells us what we need to know. Too bad she's getting an overwhelming NTA here when she apparently *was* in the wrong in that convo.", "How to find that. Any way for easy access ?", "Jesus, grow up.", "Yes, she was insulted for no reason. There was no reason to use ugly language.", "It's one of the reasons that I read the bot response. I want to know what *exactly* the person thinks they're being an asshole about, which can sometimes get lost in the waffling about and fluff of storytelling.", "NTA\n\nDad's wife learned a valuable lesson here.  Don't ask questions you don't really want the answer to.", "NTA, she said he honest and you were.", "NTA\n\nWhat did she want? You to be like \u201coh yeah, about my dad not being in my life and cheating on my mom? Nah, that\u2019s old news, totally over that. But you and dad have a lovely home and beautiful children and I hope this is just the start of something beautiful.\u201d Literally she wanted op to tell her that she didn\u2019t hold it against her for destroying their family\u2026.. along with her father. They weren\u2019t even in her life!?!? And have been together all along. This if fucking gross!", "No, NTA. She asked, you answered.", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell was his wife looking to get from you? \"Oh, I think that it's great you helped my father cheat on my mother!! I mean look at you guys, living the life! Cleary mother and I were beneath my father so go you\"!\n\nShe FAFO'd and should've been ready to take the honest answer in the chin. The honest answer SHE pushed for", "Lol how did the ex mistress expect you to react?", "NTA it's paid", "She pushed you for an answer. And aside of anything else it's not necessarily a reflection on her (well, actually, if you ask me it is because in HER position I'd have made damn sure my partner did his job as a father and a provider and not just abandoned ship...but anyway) \nShe asked. You told. You didn't disrespect her, you didn't insult her, you didn't even insult your dad! You just stated that you feel hurt by the stark contrast in your childhood Vs theirs because he wasn't around for yours. Your dad needs to get a grip and get on his knees. And step mum needs to acknowledge this is fuck all about her. Damn I hate stupid people.", "Readdress the conversation with uncle present to mediate if you desire. Looks like they need someone to hold them accountable whose not directly involved.", "OP, I'm AMAZED you agreed to stay overnight with your father having not seen him in years. That could have gone much worse.", "For OP's sake and mental health, I hope she won't visit them again. Just the fact that her dad came in for a hug as if nothing happened plus the pushy AP who asked for an honest answer then cried bcs she couldn't take it...... that all shows they'll be pushing to have her in their life and \"get over it. It's in the past\"!", "I'm certain he's already picturing himself walking OP down the aisle at her future wedding, anyway! \"I prepared her a good dinner, I am so deserving of it!\"", "*be", "Dad's wife was 100% drama seeking to follow NOT HER CHILD (and as an affair partner!!) to bed on their first night and pry, so yeah in that way N-T-A. \n\nThat said I do question how great \"being honest\" with people who have not earned that trust really is.  Just because someone asks, doesn't mean you have to give.\n\nI'm all for making sincere connections and saying our truths, but \"clearing the air\" so frequently devolves into \"let's pretend this is a scene on reality TV and yell\" when coming from people who haven't done any ground work together.\n\nIf OP had said something along the lines of \"This is obviously complicated. I'm glad [uncle] arranged this. I'm super tired though and would love to go to bed. Where's the bathroom again?\" it wouldn't actually have been less \"honest\" but it certainly would have been less exciting than calling her dad's wife a whore under their own roof in less than 24 hours of meeting with no exit plan.

I edited my response.", "I deleted my post editing it. Damn it! I live an area with poor reception and I can only respond while I drink my morning coffee. I didn\u2019t read the bot comments about insults. TBH, I think a child who had their father taken away, probably causing mother to have to work a lot, in turn a totally different lifestyle than OP\u2019s new family had, was a lousy thing for a child to have to go through. I think for 19yo to face a meeting like this and behave much better than I would have and I am a hellava lot older, speaks volumes. She had dinner, spoke well of her half siblings and retired for the evening. She was asked questions by the woman her dad left her mother for, and again, what did this woman ( old enough to be OP\u2019s mother) expect? WTH!", "\"So, OP, tell me how you think your father is much better with me than he was with your mother.... who raised you by herself.... with a broken heart. I bet even YOU wanna call me mommy, no?\"", "Welp, she did push you for an honest answer, so that's on her", "And were the person who broke up a marriage. \"Hey, he just wanted to fuck new people, I get it.  He probably should have thought about that before he took lifelong vows and had a bunch of kids with that person, though.  Chuck it all out and fuck you and now... he fucks you.  Great.  Not feeling good about the situation, but thank you for asking\"", "Tbh, OP should've met them for coffee and be done with it.", "If OP's dad's family is proper, then they're at the very least LC with them.

A whole spring break was a lot to expect OP to be able to handle for real.", "That is what I\u2019m guessing. That maybe they are LC with him. From the sounds of what she said her uncle told her. Maybe only go around, because has other kids. The fact that her uncle reached out to her when he found her. I also wonder if maybe they couldn\u2019t find her before?", "I honestly don't even understand why they felt she'd be happy to be in their house and have talked to them for like, an hour? They both blew up her family and he *abandoned* her. He didn't stick around. He never texted, called, nothing. So of course she's going to be bitter. Especially because he's around for her half siblings and wasn't for her and she's only there to meet the kids", "I would like to know how to find this too.", "Lol she\u2019s the one that cried, maybe she should grow up."]}
