My mom found out and pulled out divorce papers. My father payed child support but he was never around growing up. I asked my mom as a little girl who my father was but she didn\u2019t like talking about it but she told me the story when I was 14. My response to her was that I would never reach out to my father and I was perfectly happy having her as my only parent.\n\nNow I\u2019m 19. I still don\u2019t have the desire to have any relationship with my father. However, my father\u2019s brother reached out to me on Instagram after finding my account. He didn\u2019t say much. Just that he knew how much of a piece of crap his brother is and that he wishes me luck in life. I ended up chatting back and forth with him until we finally met in person. I won\u2019t talk about the meeting but he convinced me that perhaps it\u2019s a good idea to meet my younger half siblings. This would mean meeting my father and his wife. But I decided to do it anyway. My uncle arranges for me to spend spring break over with my father and his family. I arrive at their house. I\u2019m greeted at the door by one of my half-brothers who takes me inside and guides me to the dining room where my father and his wife are seated. My father stands up. Opening his arms preparing for a hug. I offer a handshake instead. I sit down and I have a conversation with both of them. Before having a serious conversation, they want to wait till the evening when the kids are supposed to go to their friend\u2019s house so we could be alone. I agree. Evening rolls around. Father drops the kids off at their friends house. He comes back and I have dinner with his wife. Lots of things were discussed. They didn\u2019t try to white wash or deny the fact that my dad cheated on my mom with his wife. They admitted it openly. I expected the opposite to happen but I was proven wrong. Then I talk about myself. Then they about themselves and their kids. Dinner ends. I go up to the guest room they prepped for me. Minutes later my father\u2019s wife comes up and knocks on the door. I tell her to come in. She asks me what I think of everything. Her, their house,  her kids. I say that everything is cool. To which she responds with \u201cbe honest.\u201d I said \u201cok. I\u2019m very hurt at the fact my father treated my mother the way he did because of you. The fact he gave you everything but barely anything to me or her. I can\u2019t really have a negative opinion of her kids. She leaves the room. Later my father comes up. Asks angrily I told his wife. Apparently I made her cry I said \u201cwhat she wanted to hear. My honest thoughts.\u201d Somehow I\u2019m the bad person for it.\n\nForgive any possible spelling mistakes. English isn\u2019t my first language. I also left out some details because otherwise I would be typing for hours. It wasn\u2019t as simple as my uncle convincing me.\n\nAnyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1679845767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122qfji/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_wife_how_i_really_feel/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The truth hurts, but that doesn't mean you should've lied.", "NTA\n\nYou seem confident and mature enough to cope with all of this, hopefully it gets better and if not at least you know you tried.\n\nGood for you.", "People who don't want honest answers shouldn't ask the questions.\n\nYou said nothing wrong.\n\nEmotions were running high all the way around. Give your Dad time to cool down - he likely was fearful the entire time that you would mistreat his wife. You didn't.\n\nNTA", "NTA Your English is fine BTW. What did she want you to say? You had a very open mind. I, for one, a random stranger on the internet, am proud you handled this with such poise and honesty. You weren\u2019t hurtful to her. You were honest. I guess cheats don\u2019t like honesty.", "NTA \nWhat did she expect when she was the other woman.", "NTA\n\nYou said the truth. How entitled does she have to be to expect anything else or that you feel any different about her.", "NTA, OP. I'm sorry you were placed in a situation where you are being blamed for hurting the adults who, in fact, deeply hurt you. I'm appalled that your father is angry at you for expressing your upset. I don't know how they think any reunification can happen without having to hear some hard truths. You are not obligated to spend your entire spring break with them, OP. Your dad seems to want to gloss over your feelings without deeply apologizing for the hurt he caused you and your mom; your stepmom, to her credit, actually put herself out there and is doing some of the emotional processing regarding their decision to abandon you and your mom, and if she's crying for how she treated you, that's okay. It is healthy for us to experience shame when we have done things to be ashamed of. It's not to be avoided, because that only causes more shame and guilt, and these things may have been building up inside of her these past years as she became a mother herself; her perspective of what she and your father did has likely become more upsetting to her.  \n\n\n For any future visits, maybe make them day visits only, so you have some space to process this. And give your mom a lot of hugs-- sounds like she did a good job with you.", "NTA. Dad has to do much more to make things right. That\u2019s more than just a nice dinner. (Asking for forgiveness might be nice.)\nI\u2019d give him some points for trying though. Just not as much as he hoped for.", "NTA. She asked, you answered. People need to stop asking for the honest truth when they know they won't be able to handle what they might hear. And your father is a jerk. Back then and now.", "NTA. I am so sorry about how your father treated your mother and you because of the woman he cheated with. I\u2019m sure you appreciated your father\u2019s brother for reaching out to you. Maybe it was not a good idea to plan on spending a whole week with your father and his wife. The first contact probably should have been a dinner with them and then go your separate ways. \nYou did nothing wrong. Your father\u2019s wife asked you to be honest and you were. That is probably the first time she heard your side of the story and she feels guilty, that is why she cried. She never heard how her actions affected you. She deserved to know. Your dad is TAH because he is wrong to be angry at you for telling the truth. It is up to you if you want to continue to get to know your father or not. Is it worth it to get to know him? Good luck. This is so sad.", "NTA. Sounds like you handled the situation with maturity, honesty, and dignity. Well done", "I grew up as a spectator to a similar situation.\n\nMy very best friend when we were 12-14 had had this happen to her mom. Afterward, her mom worked hard as a nurse to bring up her three girls on her own. The father lived in the same town with his lover / later wife, but never saw his children.\n\nYears later, my brother married a daughter of the adulterous 2nd wife -- offspring of a previous marriage. So the adulterous pair were at my family gatherings. It was interesting to see the \"other side.\" But I could never warm to either one. \n\n(I'm judgmental by nature. And also, my own father died when I was nine. I came to think losing a father like I had was not as hard as how my friend -- and you -- lost yours.)\n\nYour former father and his 2nd wife want forgiveness and redemption. Repellent that they then tried to guilt you into giving it. Shame on them. \n\nThey are the TAs.", "NTA. She asked, you told her.  They have no right to make you feel bad about resenting the father who de-prioritized his child after cheating in his marriage, or the woman he cheated with.  If they didn't expect that to be the case, they have their head up their asses.", " NTA. She pushed to find out what you really felt and you told her. Not your fault that she didn\u2019t like the truth.", "NTA. When you gave a polite answer, she asked for the truth. From what you said here, you didn\u2019t even trash talk, just told her how you honestly felt. It\u2019s not your fault she feels badly for how your father treated you and your mom.", "NTA. They reached out to you to come over, and asked you what how you felt, and you told them. They might feel bad about the situation, but that doesn\u2019t make you TA.", "NTA\n\nWe all know who the assholes are here and it's wild how they seem upset to hear it", "Nta", "NTA for being honest. But don't blame it all on her. He probably would have found someone else to cheat with either way.", "NTA", "NTA. Your father and his wife thought he could have some magical come together moment. They\u2019re delusional. Go back to no contact. You were duped. I have members of my family who don\u2019t have anything to with the parents or half siblings that got away in the abandonment. The only successful ones I know of happened as adults away from the terrible parents. Don\u2019t fall for it. Just walk away", "NTA She asked a very serious and dangerous question and got the honest truth, I mean seriously what was she expecting for you to say? Because she and your dad couple keep their pants on you lost out on a father for 16 years. Yes he paid child support but that\u2019s the very bare minimum he could have done.\n\nThey should both count themselves lucky you even interacted with them, never mind didn\u2019t scream shout and curse them for being major AH and ruining two peoples lives.\n\nI notice they waited to talk about their past only once their children are out of the picture. Don\u2019t want to admit their shame in front of their kids but are quiet happy to pridefully answer it in front of you.\n\nGo home and don\u2019t bother contacting them again, you can tick off the curiosity question now.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "NTA. If the Dad's wife couldn't handle honesty then she shouldn't ask for it.", "NTA he was out of your life for a really long time and you told the truth", "NTA did she honestly think you'd be happy that your father abandoned you for her? What did she want to hear? It certainly wasn't the truth. Why is he expecting you to spare her feelings when he refused to be a father to you after he abandoned you? It's not like you were malicious & yelled & screamed at her like a tyrant, you articulated how you felt about the entire situation as she had asked.", "NTA. She wanted to hear.", " You gave your father more of a chance than he even deserved and I don\u2019t even think he has any right to complain about your honesty.

Telling someone they ruined your life can happen without insults; you weren't just honest, you were rude. That being said, it doesn't absolve your father and his affair partner from their guilt. They should have known the first meeting would be a delicate thing and not push things. Instead, she wanted a teenager's \"honest opinion\" and got brutally hurt by it. Then your father blames you for not being mature enough to be honest without being insulting. On the first visit. Does he think you some sort of saint or a reincarnation of Buddha? The man needs to get in touch with reality.\n\nEdited for judgement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
