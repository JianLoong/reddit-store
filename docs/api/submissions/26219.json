It should not be up to your parents to fund those kids and certainly not for you to even think about helping fund them!\n\nShe needs to make ends meet by either getting a job or cooking healthy on a budget.  It's not hard to make cheaper meals if you cook.  She can go on SNAP and get free cheese and milk.  Not your problem and you and your parents are NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for her children but she need to stop reproducing.", "NTA but the kids are innocent in this and not responsible for your sister's stupid mistakes.  Try to stay in their lives if you can to model good behavior for them.  And if you can take them out periodically that would be kind too.  They are likely to need you.", "NTA.  Her choices shouldn't be your burden.  Taking advantage of good nature and family is not OK.  \n\nI have a son who has made less significant choices,  but similar behavior.   He's on his own now.", "Don\u2019t send money. Support the children, who are innocent in this, by sending food, clothes, school supplies or toys if you can or want to. How did she get to this place in life? A 22 year old is a child themselves if you ask me. \n\nAgain, don\u2019t send her money that you have no idea what she does with. If you support the kids as stated above and she is anything other than grateful or angry you won\u2019t send cash then it\u2019s not about the kids. \n\nI also recommend sending a pamphlet from your nearest Planned Parenthood (if it exists in your region). They will insert an IUD for her at absolutely no cost and she won\u2019t have to even worry about bringing more kids to support into the world. Unfortunately, for a small portion of society having kids is how they support themselves. Then more kids you have, the more government funds you\u2019ll get. If that\u2019s her case she won\u2019t care for the free birth control.", "NTA. I didn't support my daughter when she had her first due to her choices. We now have both of my grandbabies. You and your parents might want to decide if you will be willing to take her kids if they get removed from your sister's care.", "NTA - Your financial gift was given freely and you chose to stop. This is completely reasonable. It is difficult knowing the child will be the one's who lose out the most but remain focused on what you control. What you don't control is her actions/decisions.", "Sorry, I\u2019m not from the US. I\u2019m not really know how the food stamps work. Is possible to buy junk food on them? Why so? I always thought that the food stamps is for basic healthy food", "Nta i feel for those kids but how long can you guys subsidize her family if she keeps wanting to add to it. Maybe letting her experience her true situation will deter her. Or maybe it won\u2019t but what you\u2019re doing now isn\u2019t working.", "Anybody else a little concerned about the math a bit here? It doesn't mention the ages of the children, just that it's her third at 22. If she's a teenager when she has her first child I think there might be other concerns to consider here. If this is a for real post anyway. Also if you fear for the children's living environment then shouldn't CPS or whatever available child welfare agency be involved?", "YTA for the judgmental tone here.\n\nFirst off, as u/l3ex_G said, what you\u2019re describing is poverty. \u201cGood schools\u201d are subjective, and often that\u2019s solely based on test scores, which is not necessarily reflective of what kids are actually learning and doing.\n\nNutrition is an issue, but if she\u2019s living in poverty, SNAP or similar benefits probably go further with easy foods, especially if she\u2019s working, and even more if she\u2019s got limited transportation and multiple jobs.\n\nAlso many US states have banned or limited abortion, and not just in the last year. Birth control is often expensive and not always accessible, especially longer term higher reliability options. And sex is not always consensual. Sometimes that\u2019s outright assault, sometimes it\u2019s a way to keep yourself safe.\n\nSo yes, YTA. Not about not giving money, but about not supporting her, because that\u2019s so much more than money. If you want her and her kids to succeed, fight for everything that they need, from clean water to accessible healthcare to thriving schools and beyond. And yeah, maybe help her with some money if you have extra.", "NTA. Please call CPS and make arrangements to have them taken away from your sister. I feel so bad for her poor children. They do not deserve to grow up in this horrible environment. I am glad that you and your family will not enable her any further, as she is the real major asshole.", "NTA\n\nCan CPS take the children out of that enviroment? I'd start looking for options for those kids, they're not to blame for their mother's bad choices", "NTA. I'm sorry for the kids but that's basically a bottomless pit for the rest of you. Cutting her off saves yourselves.", "YTA.  Who the hell is \u201cwe\u201d in this equation and how old are you?  How much have you sent her?  Your parents\u2019 money and what they choose to do with it is really none of your business.  If your parents don\u2019t care about their grandchildren, that\u2019s their decision to make, not yours.  You sound like a minor,  still living at home rent-free, passing judgement on your sister\u2019s situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If anyone can get the kids out of that environment, then they should. But that\u2019s for their benefit not your sister\u2019s", "YTA.  We? Do you personally send her money? Your parents' money is not yours.  She is only 22 and likely needs some intervention.  Sounds like she was a teen mom. And the kids will suffer if you abandon them.  Are you a teen?  You're awfully judgmental.", "NTA. Sister needs to learn some hard truths. Truly, the kids don't deserve such a mom and the environment she \\[fails to\\] provide for them. Maybe a deal. She gets long term BC, and then you will provide some help, for the kids.", "YTA. This post is full of judgement and is honestly lacking A LOT of details\u2026 \nAlso- There is nothing wrong with being on government assistance to FEED HER CHILDREN.", "The sister doesn\u2019t need planned parenthood.  OP should go 50/50 with her parents and offer to pay for a hysterectomy - ONLY because it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to change her situation and doesn\u2019t seem to care as a parent.", "Healthy food is more expensive, goes bad and usually requires cooking. Also in certain areas it\u2019s harder to find the healthy stuff. \n\nJunk food has the preservatives, is usually one step and cheap.", "In the US you can use food stamps for anything considered a grocery item, except for hot foods (like from the deli, ) and alcohol. Though I think the hot food rule is absolutely a trash rule and really unfair to people who don't have access to a kitchen. Grocery items do include chips, candy, soda, etc.\nWhile it is possible to maker healthier choices by getting staple items at outlet grocery stores, and cheaper/better quality produce at farmers markets, not everyone has those options. But even canned or frozen veggies are better than none in my opinion and if OPs sister put some effort in she could make healthy choices on a budget.", "In my state, food stamps can buy any food that is not hot. Candy, soda, chips, frozen pizza, anything of that sort is allowed. My sister in law was able to purchase a full holiday meal from the supermarket deli, they just couldn't give it to her heated.\n\nWe also have a WIC benefit, for pregnant/breastfeeding women and children 5 and under that gives the recipient vouchers for specific foods. Milk, peanut butter, specific cereals (not the high sugar ones), whole fruits and veggies, etc. It will also supply formula if the baby is not breastfed. Much better system.", "I feel like what op described isn\u2019t child abuse it\u2019s just being poor.", "[deleted]", "Oh, I got used to a very expensive junk food and cheap/affordable healthy stuff. \nIt sounds sad", "And is it like average people don\u2019t know how to cook? Or it just luck of time?", "What farmers markets are you going to?  Every one I've been to are considerably more expensive than the grocery store.", "You still live at home rent-free, right?  It shows.", "Both. Cooking is a skill and depending on what you grew up with, or have been able to learn, or even have an affinity for us an issue. More importantly though, a lot of people with lower incomes are working multiple jobs or long hours, and may rely on limited public transportation infrastructure, walking, or other transport options that take a long time.", "Ya Elle-ra comment below is on point. Cooking is a lost skill, many families have parents or single parents who work and are out of the house, they don\u2019t have time to teach the kids and the kids in turn grow up not knowing how to cook.", "[deleted]", "So, while you\u2019re living free you\u2019re passing judgement?
