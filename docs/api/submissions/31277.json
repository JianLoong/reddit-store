If I overheard someone asking to switch tables because they are uncomfortable I wouldn\u2019t consider them an asshole. Not everyone wants to be around dogs even heavily trained dogs like service dogs. \n\nIf you\u2019d tried to get the disabled person with the dog removed then you\u2019d be an ableist asshole but you simply tried to get your wife and self seated elsewhere-NTA", "NTA. I thought this was going to be worse. \n\nIf you don't want to be near a dog, you are fine to ask to be moved. You didn't complain to the restaurant and you didn't ask for the dog to be removed.\n\nThat guy was a major AH to come to your table and try to scold you. That is what I would have complained about - that some random patron is harassing you at your table when you've not said or done anything to him.", "I see absolutely no issue with your request. You asked, server sat you elsewhere. I don\u2019t understand why the friend said anything to you or the other person felt bad. They should have minded their own business. If I was them, I would have actually preferred it as I like to be as far away from others as possible. So I would have seen it as a win-win. It\u2019s ok for you to not like dogs and not want to eat around them. NTA. It\u2019s ok for you to do your thing and for them to do theirs. They shouldn\u2019t have confronted you.", "NTA \n\nPeople are allowed to have preferences.\n\nHe asked to sit somewhere else. \n\nHe did not ask for the dog to be moved.  He did not question the dog being there.\nHe didn't say the person didn't need the dog.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't an abelist. You would only be one if you started asking the staff to remove the disabled person and their service dog.\n\nYour request to be seated at a different table was very reasonable.\n\nI highly doubt the disabled person sent their friend to confront you about this. They typically do not want to have conflict and draw more attention to themselves since they prefer to be treated same as everyone else. Most likely it's another case of someone got offended on behalf of someone else.", "NTA  \nYou did the right thing by asking for a different table. You should be able to eat in peace as well.   \nIt's not as if you harassed the dog owner.  \n\n\nYou handled the friend far better than me.", "Nta, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t like dogs, and you don\u2019t have to sit next to one even if they are trained and will just sit by their owner. It\u2019s not like you complained to the owner of the dog or tried to make them feel bad, and you did everything repectfully. I think there was a misunderstanding, and the friend thought you were complaining that you didn\u2019t like service dogs in particular.", "NTA. You could have had any number of reasons for not wanting to be seated near a dog. I can think of at least a couple of reasons that would  actually *fit under the ADA*.", "NTA, just because someone has a service dog doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to be or wants to be around them. Your comfort is also valid, and you weren\u2019t rude at all.", "This is an easy NTA.  You don't want to sit near a dog at a restaurant and asked to be moved.  There is nothing wrong with that, there is nothing wrong with how you went about it and there is nothing wrong with why you did it.\n\nThe person who approached you however *was* way out of line and I wouldn't give it another thought.", "NTA. I LOVE when people take offense on others behalf lmfao. You\u2019re asking to be moved from the dog, not the person that has them.", "NTA If you politely asked to be moved and didn't ask for the dog to be removed, there was nothing wrong with that.", "NTA\n\nSo for a while I was afraid of dogs, terrified. I, for the most part, got over it. Then some douchebag's unleashed German Shepard lunged at me, lucky didn't bite me. However I'm back to very anxious around bigger dogs. \n\nI know service dogs are well trained and super well behaved, but I would still be anxious and want a different table.", "I mean, as somebody with a disability, I don\u2019t see anything ablest about what you did. If I\u2019m understanding right, you just don\u2019t like dogs and the owners disability has nothing to do with this. If you don\u2019t want to sit next to the dog, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with politely asking to be moved to a different table.\n\nThat being said, because it is a service dog, as other commenters have pointed out, it\u2019s likely very well behaved and wouldn\u2019t have bothered you at all throughout your meal. The only thing that came off as kinda rude to me here was asking to be sat *\u201dfar\u201d* away from the dog. I can see why the owner would be a bit offended by that, but again, that\u2019s not really  ablest imo.", "NTA \n\nYou would have been if you made them move but you chose to move yourselves to a different spot that better suited your preferences. It\u2019s a dog, people should really get over themselves. Dogs are not humans. It\u2019s not as if you made a scene or said you didn\u2019t want to sit near a disabled person or someone of a different ethnicity.", "NTA", "NTA", "NOPE NTA. Im a huge fan of dogs and i have multiples. I dont however have them sitting near me when i am eating. Now i get that the owner of the service dog doesnt really have a choice in the matter, but i do. And if i dont want to be around the dog, im going to ask for another table. You didnt make them move or leave because of your preference. And he was just butthurt about it. He can get over it. Its his insecurity not yours", "NTA from me.  I disagree with your attitude toward service dogs.  But if you don't like dogs, I see nothing wrong with you asking to be seated away from the service dog, as long as you weren't deliberately raising your voice or something to make the service dog's owner feel bad.  \n\nThe dog's owner's friend was completely out of line, I think.  If he and the dog's owner wante ddto discuss quietely between them how they didn't like you, that's ordinary table talk and they're entitled to their opinions.  But he should not have come over to confront you and interfere with you and your wife at dinner.", "NTA, and you did literally what is expected of you. You asked for your own reasonable accommodation (if there was an available space away from the dog). You didn't get in the face of the individual handler. You didn't ask for them to be moved or removed. There was no involved harassment, just someone asking for themselves to be seated elsewhere.\n\nIf their feelings get hurt because not everyone wants to be by their dog, that's on them to manage. Other people are absolutely allowed to not want to be near dogs, whether it's due to a general dislike, a hard phobia or an allergy. Most reasonable SD handlers understand this, and honestly? Usually, they are more high empathy and understanding of someone who has reasons to stay away from their dog. Most prefer it over the number of people who fawn over their dog, distract them, or try to secretly feed them.", "NTA at all! I am allergic to dogs(not badly but my eyes puff up really bad sometimes and I can\u2019t stop sneezing round them) I would be furious if someone came up to me and asked what the problem was!", "NTA. I've seen similar posts where the issue was a screaming baby, and the OP simply requested a table away from them so they could enjoy their dinner. Doesn't mean they hate kids. But the other table berates them and calls them an AH. I don't get it. No one was hurt or attacked with a request to be moved for comfort.", "NTA. The other person should mind his own business. Nobody was speaking to him, and it\u2019s nothing to do with him where you want to be seated.", "NTA. I love dogs but not everyone does and I\u2019m always very careful about how my two behave when we\u2019re out, and I make sure I\u2019m always aware of what they\u2019re doing.", "NTA.

I\u2019d feel the same way about someone asking to be moved because they didn\u2019t like visible disability or disability aids or just didn\u2019t feel like being around something they \u201cdon\u2019t like\u201d", "If you don\u2019t want to sit by the dog because it\u2019s a service dog or because the dogs owner has a disability than you\u2019re ablest.

You should have made your request politely and quietly so the other patrons couldn\u2019t hear you, and you should have been more polite to the person who confronted you. It\u2019s okay to explain that, you don\u2019t like dogs in a kind and polite manner. \n\nYou could have said \u201cI\u2019m sorry for causing you offense or distress. While I understand your dog is a service dog, I personally don\u2019t like dogs. It\u2019s not about your dog specifically or about your disability or need for a service dog.

YTA", "The only way you're NTA is if you have an allergy or phobia of dogs. Disabled people need all kinds of aids and they have enough issues with people doubting they need them. \n\nI knew someone who had a stranger challenge her need for accommodations until she flashed her colostomy bag at him.

I think it is your superior entitled tone that makes YTA.", "Not a popular opinion but YTA. The dog wasn\u2019t touching you or otherwise infringing on your experience.

It's perfectly fine to not want something. I don't like sitting near large groups, even more so when they have kids. Dogs are animals, and no matter how well trained there is that chance of something going wrong and something bad happening.", "NTA, you didn't bother the service dog or its handler and you were both accommodated. Seems inclusive to me.", "Not the asshole at all. If you'd asked them to move or complained about the dog you would be in the wrong, but you didn't. You just asked for a different table.

Dog owners I encounter on walks on bad days are often super offended when I cross the street to avoid their dog or decline petting a dog that comes up to me.

But that\u2019s my line I draw. \nI\u2019m generally sick of dog owners imposing dogs on non dog ppl. I don\u2019t allow dogs in my house.

Which, amazing if true.", "I'm saying this as a huge dog lover who has trouble understanding people who don't like them but NTA. If you'd asked the dog owner to move or asked to have them moved or removed from the restaurant, then you'd be TA.
