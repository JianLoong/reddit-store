He has two brothers, both younger. One if them \"Danny\" (m25) has been dating a girl (f24) for a couple months. \n\nI'll be honest, I don't quite like her, ever since she was introduced to the family I got a weird feeling about her. My BIL is usually a very cheerful and happy person but he doesn't look like himself since he's with her (and I know him well since we were classmates in school), it's like she's draining him from all happiness. I think the problem is that she's too jealous and she doesn't like it at all when me and him are together, she's always trying to get his attention and getting him to be next to her all the time. Sometimes we're talking and she comes and takes over the conversation, it's very annoying. \n\nThe rest of the family is quite okay with her, my husband doesn't like her as much either (basically because I don't like her), she's invited to most of our family gatherings. \n\nHowever, two weeks ago was my birthday. I spend my birthday just with my husband, then we went to have dinner with my family, and a different day we went to have dinner with his family to celebrate. So I picked the restaurant (one that everyone would like) and agreed to them when it was convenient. I invited my other BIL (m20) and his boyfriend (m21), MIL, FIL, and Danny, but not her. Danny asked me if she could come but I said I had already made the reservations and such, he dropped it then. We posted photos on social media and such.\n\nYesterday we had a family gathering, nothing special happened, we just wanted to have lunch together. She came and kinda ignored me, which is not weird since she tends to do that. But then she started telling me stuff like I don't consider her family then she asked me if I had a nice birthday party, I said yeah, it's very sad you couldn't come, we had the reservations and such, she told me to quit it and stop acting like I like her when I'm always getting between her boyfriend and her which is not true. I told her that the restaurant didn't had any bigger tables and that's all, but she continued arguing. MIL told her to just quit it too, but she made such a big deal of it. \n\nNow my family is telling me I could've just invited her to avoid all of this, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685310757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uc8m0/aita_for_excluding_my_sil_from_a_family_dinner/", "score": 478, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't single, expecting your BIL to prioritise you over his partner is not acceptable.

Let him go, OP.", "YTA Also I get the impression you want to be the only young female present. Since the other brother's partner is a male. Are you this jealous with all women?", "> she asked me if I had a nice birthday party, I said yeah, it's very sad you couldn't come, we had the reservations and such, she told me to quit it and stop acting like I like her\n\nYeah, you're an AH.

I actually feel sorry for her. You're like the Queen of the Pick Me's - and I say that reluctantly, as a woman whose own best friend is male, and who really hates the inherent misogyny of that term; but honestly, every time I started to question it, I'd read another comment from you suggesting that you \"know your BIL better\" or deserve to \"have private time to talk to him\" at a family function. He's her partner, like your husband is yours. You don't get to monopolize other people's partners, or get vengeful when THEY want to spend time with them. \n\nAnd that's what you did . . . you literally got vengeful and cut her out of a family occasion because you don't like her.

No wonder she doesn't want you being alone with her man. You've trained his brother to dislike her based solely on YOUR dislike for her. Why the hell would she think you wouldn't be trying to do the same with BIL in your super private alone time? Honey you're cold to this girl and everyone knows it. You clearly aren't here for a real judgement, you only want people to help gang up on her with you. The only thing she's done is called you out on behavior you admitted to doing.

A middle school mean girl, to be exact.  If you invite everyone except one person\u2019s partner, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you\u2019re deliberately excluding that partner.  And then to top it off by telling a stupid, obvious lie, and reeeeally grinding in that lie\u2026yeah, you\u2019re behaving like someone half your age.  If you\u2019re trying to turn your husband\u2019s family into a messy drama, bravo, this was a great move.

You are actively getting between them by not inviting her to a family event, even if it was your birthday. You intentionally left her off the reservation, and then lied and pretended it was the fault of the restaurant.

She had every right to be annoyed with you, and your MIL telling her to stop was probably because your MIL only heard the end of the conversation and not you blatantly lying to her.
