Because I can usually see a lot of \"ass antlers\" as they're called here in public in summer.", "NTA Honestly even if it was obscene (and I'm not going to count \"this side up\" as obscene) your aunt was in the wrong here. People walk around in public with explicit and obscene tattoos showing. Also, notably, your aunt freaked out based on the location, not even what it said. You don't have anything to feel bad about. Your aunt is the one who acted like an AH here.", "NTA. Your Aunt made the decision to leave not you, she  let her disapproval of your tattoo was more important than her children getting to swim and play in the water.", "NTA\n\nA tattoo in a certain place means absolutely nothing. I got one there when I was 16, and am 35 now. I completely forget I have it until my kids see it and mention it. I think it\u2019s hilarious because my 5 year old says I have a cutie mark like a My Little Pony.", "NTA.  Not sure what your aunt is complaining about.  Does she freak out at the beach?  Is your tattoo pornographic?  You didn't punish your cousins, your aunt did that in an effort to control and shame you.  Somehow I don't see her having the same reaction if it was someone else.", "NTA assuming it's not pornographic or outwardly obscene. It's your body and you have the right to use the pool. Sounds like your aunt is the one who needs some help.", "NTA.\n\nThe tat isn't particularly vulgar. It's not harming anyone, except perhaps the prudishness of your aunt.\n\nI feel sorry for the kids weren't able to enjoy because their mom can't stand something they (the kids) probably don't mind.", "NTA, next time tell her to stop staring at your ass", "NTA. Not your circus. Not your monkeys. Your aunt is the reason her kids didn\u2019t get to swim.", "NTA. The funny thing is the kids there wouldn't even give a second thought about your tat. So why the aunt was really mad  confuses me. Well besides you not listening to what she said.", "NTA she was acting trampy by being wrong.She hurt the kids over her acting like trampy baby. Your tattoo is fine it\u2019s art.", "So your aunt is punishing her children for something you did.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I find that very judgemental. If she didn't use vulgar language, her kids would have never known what that is.\n\nLive and let be. Maybe your aunt will learn that one day.", "INFO I know people 40plus with \u201ctramp stamps\u201d, I am not understanding why this is such a different tattoo than any other tattoo? I am offended by racist, fascist tattoos and yes, I will judge for those ones, but I am not so sure why this is a big deal? NTA Edit Your aunt thinks THAT is obscene? Wow. Yes. Definitely NTA", "NTA, end of story", "Info:\nWhat is the content of the tattoo?\n\n99% of tattoos would be fine, but I've also seen people wandering around Costco with tattoos of violent r@pe/un-aliving on their arms as well as cursive versions of every swear word under the sun.\n\nIf your tattoo is just some flowers or whatever, N T A, but if it's something that would bump up the rating of a movie or get an \"explicit content\" label on a song, then Y T A", "lol at the immaturity of packing up your kids and leaving. talk about lack of acceptance or understanding of anything but your own world view. yikes. and the real losers are your little cousins, who just want to see and spend time with their family.", "NTA.  It's really sad your aunt ruined the day for her kids. But it was her: YOU didn't. If she is that much of a pearl clutcher that she found the tatoo offensive (which is this day and age is ridiculous) she could have asked you quietly to cover it. That would have been the adult way to handle it. \n\nBut instead she screams at you like you are a naughty teenager.  Nope. That is not the way to get compliance. If that is her standard mode of communications they it was probably very healthy for her kids to see someone stand up to her.", "NTA. Aunt is the A for taking them home. Wearing a bikini how does she expect you to cover it up?", "NTA.  While what the tattoo says may not necessarily be appropriate, it's hardly obscene, and is at a level that kids wouldn't get it anyway.  Your aunt needs to chill out and not make a big deal out of it.  Because of the fit she threw, now the kids are going to ask questions and want to know what it says and why.", "I would say NTA unless it's actually obscene.", "NTA. But I will say it depends on the tramp stamp truly. I\u2019ve seen some that are fairly innocuous, a succubus symbol or a flower etc, but I\u2019ve seen others that are fairly explicit. Provided it\u2019s not an explicit one that say if it were on a tshirt would it be inappropriate around kids, then NTA. That\u2019s my go to test when it comes to tattoos, would my middle school teacher have made me flip the shirt inside out or change. If it\u2019s a yes then it\u2019s explicit, if not then no.", "INFO: you said the tattoo was trashy. Is it vulgar? I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, but it kind of depends on the tattoo detail. Location of the tattoo alone shouldn\u2019t matter, and your aunt is definitely an AH for the name calling and yelling. You shouldn\u2019t really feel bad about your cousins not being able to enjoy the pool, that\u2019s completely on your aunt. It\u2019s not even her house, she has no right to impose rules of any kind while there.", "NTA\n\n>My aunt saw it and freaked the fuck out yelling at me to cover up my \"tramp stamp\"\n\nWhat does she think is going to happen? That her kids are going to see it and catch the Tramp Stamp like some kind of virus?", "NTA. Tattoos are normal, and children need to be taught not to judge others personal choices. The kids are probably more upset with their mom for ruining their fun day with you than they are about your \u201ctrashy\u201d tattoo. \n\nMy mom had a tinker bell trampstamp when I was growing up, because we both shared a love for tinker bell and she got it for me. she\u2019s since covered it with a very large back tattoo (it wasn\u2019t looking pretty after 12 years and 4 kids), but you know what I thought as a kid? \u201cWow! I love my moms pretty tattoo!\u201d When I saw other peoples tattoos, I thought \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d You are not hurting the children by existing with a tattoo.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
