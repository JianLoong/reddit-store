Not your circus. Not your monkeys. Your aunt is the reason her kids didn\u2019t get to swim.", "NTA. The funny thing is the kids there wouldn't even give a second thought about your tat.

While what the tattoo says may not necessarily be appropriate, it's hardly obscene, and is at a level that kids wouldn't get it anyway.

And I\u2019d crack up if a girl I was seeing had your tat lmao.", "Oh, she\u2019s definitely going to give her daughter a complex", "They are labeled an \u201cAsshole Enthusiast,\u201d so I wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.", "Yep super catholic. My aunt and uncle are one of those weird couples where ones super religious and the other thinks religion is bs. Its a weird dynamic.", "But we do call it whale tail, so there's that.", "The Normans were originally Vikings who were given Normandy by the French so they would quit raiding Paris.  This group lived in Normandy for about 200 years, did quite well, then decided to conquer England.  They did quite well with that, too.", "NTA. She made a mountain out of a mole hill. Don't understand why people come into your private space and expect you to change to suit them.", ">it's mostly just butterflies...\n\nAhhh, that's not so trashy\n\n>... it says \"this side up\" \n\n\ud83d\ude06I stand corrected!\n\nBut NTA. Your aunt's drama driven prudishness is probably doing way more harm to your cousins than seeing your tattoo.", "NTA\n\nI mean kids can't even read cursive anymore", "NTA", "NYT. Let your tattoo flag fly. She needs to get over herself.", "NTA. Lots of Australians are covered in scribbles. Completely unremarkable. The kids are going to see all sorts of things as they grow up. It\u2019s a fun tattoo and no harm done. Your aunty is way overthinking this.", "NTA but here in the Southern United States tramps stamps haven't been popular in 20-25 years.  it has been at least 10 years since the last time I have ever seen one lol.  But i live in a very small town.", "ES PRANKTE GRO\u1e9e IHR ARSCHGEWEIH \n\ni forgot what song that\u2019s from but i remember listening to it on my dads phone when i was a child", "Huh TIL. Thanks!", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! She\u2019s the one with the dirty mind!", "Exactly. It\u2019s not like it said: \u201c GAME OVER. INSERT COIN.\u201d", "I mean some were literally shaped like a dart board with a bullseye.", "A preference for the prone bone position. Or prone bone anal. The butterfly is commonly associated with Thailand and has become associated with proud promiscuity, amongst other things. Rightly or wrongly.  Aunty might have one herself perhaps?", "I haven't heard of anyone getting a tramp stamp in over 10 years either, so we're all learning all kinds of new stuff here in this thread!", "Back in the 90s and early 2000s, a Whale Tail was the part of your thong that showed over the waistband of your pants, shorts etc.", "WTF. Getting offended by someone else's body is incredibly trashy. Does she yell and scream at teenagers wearing crop tops? People that fall outside her definition of attraction? She's got a long, hard, impossible life ahead of her worry about other people \"corrupting\" her precious children.\n\nNTA", "Unless it\u2019s a swastica or something, I fail to see why it should be an issue. NTA", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. Your aunt body shamed you and was way over dramatic.", "NTA. Tramp stamp? Lol, that's a new one. I doubt her kids even know what it means.", "NTA", "NTA. I will be 60 this year. I\u2019m a reasonably respectable grandmother. My tramp stamp says \u201cAkta Gamat\u201d in script with filigree. We can be trashy together.", "NTA, sorry your aunt is a complete moron.", "It\u2019s not the best, but not the worst. I\u2019ve seen a \u201clucky you\u201d tattoo between the below the hip bones, but above the bikini.

I told my husband it\u2019s my air b&b rating \ud83d\ude02", "I'm also Australian and your Aunt is fucked up man. NTA.\n\nPs. I know someone who got a tattoo on their butt cheek of one of those meat stamp things, like you stamp on a steak, and it says 100% aussie beef. This way up seems tame in comparison... \n\nActually, info: is your Aunt Australian born or Australian welcomed? Because maybe cultures intersected here? I dunno, still seems like she sexualised you for no reason at a family swim... feels icky.\n\nDon't feel bad mate, you didn't do shit hey.", "NTA.\n\nAlso after reading your story I'm SO relieved I didn't get a \"tramp stamp\" in 1999-2004 when they were trending hard.\n\nTramp stamps, tongue piercings, and zines. :D", "Ahhh the infamous \"tramp stamp\"... the world's most appropriately named thing.\n\nNTA, I'm sure the kids have seen worse, or at least equally bad. If not, they're going to in short order. They might as well get used to it.", "NTA\u2026 when I was 19 (now 31) I got a pair of lips on my right ass cheek that says \u201ckiss me\u201d \u2026 can\u2019t wait to see how that plays out when my kids are old enough to read.", "NTA- you aunt needs to loosen up if she\u2019s that wound up over a tattoo", "NTA. If the body part is okay to show, so is any ink imbedded into it. Unless it's visually pornographic of course. Which means genitalia BTW for those being nitpicky. Auntie is off her meds or something.", "That\u2019s a good one", "In Spanish \"Matr\u00edcula\", you can translate it like \"licence plate\" like the one in the cars.", "I know them as Schlampenstempel.", "Young kids would not get that in a million years. They can watch a show like Big Bang Theory and miss the sexual innuendo for years and years.", "Yeah same I thought it was just a funny joke, like how boxes say \u201cthis side up\u201d or something similar", "We don't know how old the kids are, so they could. Either way, I think it could bring up uncomfortable questions.", "Easy NTA.", "NTA\n\nDoes she think tattoos are contagious? That's a pretty extreme response", "NTA.  Your tattoo didn't prevent your cousins from playing in the pool; your aunt's irrational behavior did.  It's your body.  A couple of butterflies and \"this side up\" tattooed on your lower back aren't going to hurt your cousins.  Don't feel obligated to cover up unless you feel like it.  There is no good reason to placate your aunt.", "NTA\nFYA that's called a tattoo and doesn't actually certify your level of trampiness. Auntie doesn't get to judge your choices of body adornment or blame you for her kids not getting to go swimming..", "NTA - but honestly, neither is your aunt. You can do whatever you want with your body, in the end, it's yours and your decision. But nobody is forced to agree and like your tattoo. What makes you think that if you like something, everyone should like it and agree with you???? If you do something that is outside of what society considers normal, own it, but don't get offended when other people don't like it or disagree with you, they are entiteled to their own opinion just like you are!!!", "NTA", "I\u2019ve always called them cum targets.", "\ud83e\udd23.

It's a peeve of mine. Compound nouns are always written as one word in Dutch!", "Any parent with half a brain could deflect that sort of question. A much older child may well know what that means, but then they have already been exposed to sex and a good conversation is in order. The drama is totally disproportionate to the situation.\n\nI wonder what many parents would think if they knew what 11 year olds say to each other at school? It is disgusting and hair raising. Half the class \"educates\" the other half. Parents need to be having frank conversations early with their children in order to prepare as best they can, not running home and hiding."]}
