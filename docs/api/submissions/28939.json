I don\u2019t blame you for leaving, but you don\u2019t have a choice about coming back since you\u2019re a minor. Your parents are handling this very poorly. They should be a lot more sympathetic about how upsetting this is for you, not cutting off your lunch money and telling you you don\u2019t care about the family.", "I'm sorry you're so upset. I can't say you're being unreasonable. You just sound sad and maybe a bit confused by the recent turn of events?\n\nJust make sure that your friend's parents are OK with you being over there? That's what might force you back home?\n\nNAH. I'm really sorry everything is so haywire for your right now.", "From what you say in your post, of course you're not the asshole. You're going through an incredibly difficult experience. If your parents had just been upset and concerned for you that would be one thing. But for them to turn it around and say you're letting down your family - that's awful. It's not your job as a 16 year old to be a comfort to your parents. It's their job to be there for you.\n\nHowever, in your title you say you went \"MIA\" for a week. \"MIA\" implies that people don't know where you are - the \"M\" stands for \"missing\" after all. That would not be OK, because even if your parents are acting like dicks (assuming they're not being abusive or anything), they do have a right to know where you are and know you're safe.", "It's not as straightforward as that. I don't think you're the asshole, but nobody is blame free here. I don't see how your parents can level the accusation that you don't give a crap about your family immediately after telling you that they are getting a divorce.\n\nIts not your responsibility to look after your siblings, it's your parents, and its also their responsibility to look after you too.\n\nTaking all the money out of your lunch account was a childish reaction and a way to try and regain control over you.\n\nHaving said all that -  you need to talk to them, for everyone's sake.", "NAH. \n\nMarriage is very complicated and you aren't privy to their marriage issues, even if you are their kid. Do you really want to hear about all the possible issues they could be having? They don't need to give you a reason.\n\nThey're unhappy in their marriage and have made a decision (one that was probably a long time coming) to end it. This is not easy for them, and they probably dreaded telling all of you.\n\nThat said, it's fair that you are upset and angry about it. I would have perhaps tried to approach it without anger, and asked if you could have a couple days with friends to get used to the idea.\n\nAs it currently stands, you're a minor and under their roof. So disappearing in a fit of rage is not a great answer to your problem.", "NAH.

I think you should go home for your little sibs because they will need you.\n\nDivorce is tough. I\u2019m sure your parents agonized over when and how to tell the three of you, and they probably have more to share about next steps. Your little sibs are probably worried, as you might be, about what the timeline looks like, where you will live (will your parents keep the house or sell and buy two different houses), when you will see each parent, will you stay in the same schools, etc. Maybe you can ask your parents these questions and reassure the littler ones that things will be okay. They will be. It\u2019s not a job you want to have, but they no doubt look up to you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this. There are lots of people you can talk to if you need to vent.

Your parents\u2019 relationship is their own business. \n\nJust know that you don\u2019t have to take sides; you don\u2019t have to make someone the bad guy. Hopefully your parents are mature enough not to badmouth each other to you and your siblings - if that does happen, just let them know that you don\u2019t want to hear it and walk away. It\u2019s hard going through this, but you can make it through to a calmer space.", "NAH  I\u2019m kind of impressed your parents didn\u2019t fight in front of their kids, or bad mouth each other to their kids.

This is important to establish early with people who are breaking up (whether you are related to them or not) if they are both likely to see you as somebody to vent to.

I am speaking as somebody who had to send a child elsewhere for a while after a brain injury turned his father into somebody who was not emotionally safe for children to be around.  Coordinate with your friend's parents.

Talk a lot about your education.  About how you have two years to go before adulthood (assuming that is 18 in your area) and you need stability and not to be dealing with the emotions of grown-ass adults who seem to have temporarily (one hopes) forgotten that their divorce is not your mess to clean up.", "You're not responsible for the well being of the family unit. You are a child still. You need to focus on You and education. The adults (your parents) are responsible for the family and you. \n\nAs parents, we're supposed to shield out children from adult issues/problems so you can grow up to be better then us. Don't feel bad if they don't tell you the reasons for the divorce. I know you want to know and you will eventually but that's not for you to worry about. \n\nSeek therapy.

You also might not want to hear this but unfortunately they don\u2019t owe you an explanation as to why the relationship has broken down. My advice would be to talk to them, keep open dialog, and they will probably share more and more as time goes on. \n\nThey\u2019re really not handling your need for space well, so they suck too. Taking lunch money etc is just antagonising the situation. I also think they could cut you some slack and find some compromise to offer space in a safe manner.", "NTA\n\nLet's put this into perspective. Your entire life has been flipped upside down, and you seem like you needed a safe neutral space to process what is happening in your life ATM. Your parents are incredibly uncaring. They have had time to think this through and come to this decision (their divorce). Expecting you and your siblings to just accept it and adjust automatically is selfish. I'm so sorry you are going through this. Hopefully, your parents will realize this is something huge in your life that you need time to adjust to.", "NTA.

You did as good a job as any 16 year old could be expected to do in that situation. \n\nMaybe a short explanation as you packed would have helped, but it doesn't seem like your parents would have taken it well either way. I think it's fair to say they should have expected something like this to happen and been in a better headspace to accept you staying somewhere else for space/whatever. \n\nDon't let this affect the trajectory of your life. Shit may hit the fan, but make sure you do well in school and graduate. Make your parents pay for a therapist so you aren't carrying any conscious/subconscious baggage from this into the rest of your life.", "NTA, your parents had all the time they needed to process this new development and I'm sure they both leaned on their friends while they were adjusting to the idea of their marriage ending.

The next steps are going to be contacting police because your friend's parents aren't in a position to say \"no\" to sending you home.  They are likely trying to avoid that altogether but it's going to be a very real outcome if your \"week\" turns into two weeks or more.", "They could just report them as a runaway to the police, get them and the friend they're staying with in trouble.", "Let's be honest, OP is a minor and isn't entitled to just go live somewhere else to \"cool off.\"  That's not a healthy way of handling this, either.\n\nBut suggesting the parents are \"absorbed in their own selfish world\" because they are getting a divorce and now are having to manage their family is completely over the top.  The fact that OP is completely surprised by this move is a sign that the parents are anything BUT selfish, because selfish people aren't afraid to air their dirty laundry to their children on the daily.\n\nAnd \"there won't be family to protect you from now on\"?  What are you, 13?  This is so melodramatic.", "Except for the fact that OP is a minor, and OPs parents are legally responsible. Also, hate to be this guy, but you don't control your parents relationship and they don't have to stay married to take care of you. \n\nYou don't control anyone's relationship. Sometimes things stop working - would you force them to be together? Ops parents don't have to stay together, but regardless of marital status they are OPs legal guardians. \n\nESH or NAH, depending on details I cant possibly know about OPs parents. OPs parents clearly lack emotional health and failed to model, instill or engage in healthy communication. This might not be their fault - often you model what is taught, this might be inter generational dysfunction. Fault also isn't a helpful way to view this: OPs parents were once kids who once had parents who clearly mucked up at least a bit, and now they're the parents mucking things up. \n\nIt's clear they're trying to work on being better people, and they bravely saw the truth - they can't be happy or grow with each other as life partners. It's also clear there's a lot of work to be done - draining OPs lunch account is desperate, childish and proves my whole point. The whole fam needs therapy, and OP needs to go home so they can start doing the hard work and becoming a better family unit, even if that means the parents are no longer sharing a bed (NOT that that is ANY of OPs biz IN THE FIRST PLACE). \n\nOp, might be good to explain to your parents WHY you took off. It looks like there's a lot more going in here.... as an older sibling who used to have similar convos with my little sister. \n\nIt seems given you and your siblings discussion, you might have been picking up some of the slack in raising them. Your family is so dysfunctional that you felt obligated to the kids, not the parents.... yikes kiddo, ypu should not have taken on any of whatever you had to take on. \n\nTaking on inappropriate parental roles can often coincide with something called \"emotional incest\" - usually the child, taking on the role of parent for the other children, begins doing it for the parents too. And you're not supposed to parent your parent till you're an adult, not because they're neglecting you but because they're aging. \n\nThis is probably why you reacted so strongly - your place in your parents relationship and marriage is more parental and less of a typical child relationship. I could be 1005% off-base here, and if I am ignore me, but I'd think about why you're actually mad OP - it's probably not the divorce, but the inevitable changes it will bring and their inability to include you yet again in another big, life altering decision leaving you to clean up the pieces and help your siblings... bring me to my next worry, who's parenting you? Who's helping you grow, who's hearing your worries, who's thinking of what's best? Who's helping you find your place in this crazy upside-down world of ours?\n\nIt doesn't seem to be your parents, given that once you got worried instead of trusting them with that worry you booked and found a friend who knew your emotional needs and did not question them. However, now that your parents are breaking up, maybe they'll get to become better parents. Please go home and at least give them a chance. I'm not saying they'll turn into Mary Poppins, but they should start to try to be better parents. \n\nYou deserve that - and if you don't get it from them, don't hold onto that bitterness. You will find a parent or two as you go through life when you need them, you just have to look. Sometimes it'll be a manager you weren't expecting, or a professor or TA who really gets you, or a local server or cashier who knows just what to say, or someone at church, or.... I've found tons of extra parents along the way, but I had to be open to the idea that my parents weren't perfect, no parent is and sometimes in life your only choice is to take what you get.\n\n Maybe their relationship was distracting them from their #1 job: taking care of and raising you and your siblings. That's my hope. Go home OP, and get some rest, but most of all remember you are NOT an asshole, you are someone who's growing and that's ok. You deserve love and family, at least you have your siblings - they must be hate not having you around, your parents are probably driving them bonkers.", "I hate comments like this.
