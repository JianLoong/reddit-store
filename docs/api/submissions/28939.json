I don\u2019t blame you for leaving, but you don\u2019t have a choice about coming back since you\u2019re a minor. Your parents are handling this very poorly. They should be a lot more sympathetic about how upsetting this is for you, not cutting off your lunch money and telling you you don\u2019t care about the family.", "I'm sorry you're so upset. I can't say you're being unreasonable. You just sound sad and maybe a bit confused by the recent turn of events?\n\nJust make sure that your friend's parents are OK with you being over there? That's what might force you back home?\n\nNAH. I'm really sorry everything is so haywire for your right now.", "From what you say in your post, of course you're not the asshole. You're going through an incredibly difficult experience. If your parents had just been upset and concerned for you that would be one thing. But for them to turn it around and say you're letting down your family - that's awful. It's not your job as a 16 year old to be a comfort to your parents. It's their job to be there for you.\n\nHowever, in your title you say you went \"MIA\" for a week. \"MIA\" implies that people don't know where you are - the \"M\" stands for \"missing\" after all. That would not be OK, because even if your parents are acting like dicks (assuming they're not being abusive or anything), they do have a right to know where you are and know you're safe.", "It's not as straightforward as that. I don't think you're the asshole, but nobody is blame free here. I don't see how your parents can level the accusation that you don't give a crap about your family immediately after telling you that they are getting a divorce.\n\nIts not your responsibility to look after your siblings, it's your parents, and its also their responsibility to look after you too.\n\nTaking all the money out of your lunch account was a childish reaction and a way to try and regain control over you.\n\nHaving said all that -  you need to talk to them, for everyone's sake.", "NAH. \n\nMarriage is very complicated and you aren't privy to their marriage issues, even if you are their kid. Do you really want to hear about all the possible issues they could be having? They don't need to give you a reason.\n\nThey're unhappy in their marriage and have made a decision (one that was probably a long time coming) to end it. This is not easy for them, and they probably dreaded telling all of you.\n\nThat said, it's fair that you are upset and angry about it. I would have perhaps tried to approach it without anger, and asked if you could have a couple days with friends to get used to the idea.\n\nAs it currently stands, you're a minor and under their roof. So disappearing in a fit of rage is not a great answer to your problem.", "NAH.

I think you should go home for your little sibs because they will need you.\n\nDivorce is tough. I\u2019m sure your parents agonized over when and how to tell the three of you, and they probably have more to share about next steps. Your little sibs are probably worried, as you might be, about what the timeline looks like, where you will live (will your parents keep the house or sell and buy two different houses), when you will see each parent, will you stay in the same schools, etc. Maybe you can ask your parents these questions and reassure the littler ones that things will be okay. They will be. It\u2019s not a job you want to have, but they no doubt look up to you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this. There are lots of people you can talk to if you need to vent.

Your parents\u2019 relationship is their own business. \n\nJust know that you don\u2019t have to take sides; you don\u2019t have to make someone the bad guy. Hopefully your parents are mature enough not to badmouth each other to you and your siblings - if that does happen, just let them know that you don\u2019t want to hear it and walk away. It\u2019s hard going through this, but you can make it through to a calmer space.", "NAH  I\u2019m kind of impressed your parents didn\u2019t fight in front of their kids, or bad mouth each other to their kids.

This is important to establish early with people who are breaking up (whether you are related to them or not) if they are both likely to see you as somebody to vent to.  Which is an extremely uncool thing to dump on your own kid and many couples who are breaking up manage not to stoop to it, but if they think that stealing your EATING MONEY is okey doke...\n\nETA:  OP, if you are not talking to your friend's parents about this, please do so right away.

Talk a lot about your education.  About how you have two years to go before adulthood (assuming that is 18 in your area) and you need stability and not to be dealing with the emotions of grown-ass adults who seem to have temporarily (one hopes) forgotten that their divorce is not your mess to clean up.", "You're not responsible for the well being of the family unit. You are a child still. You need to focus on You and education. The adults (your parents) are responsible for the family and you. \n\nAs parents, we're supposed to shield our children from adult issues/problems so you can grow up to be better then us. Don't feel bad if they don't tell you the reasons for the divorce. I know you want to know and you will eventually but that's not for you to worry about. \n\nSeek therapy.

You also might not want to hear this but unfortunately they don\u2019t owe you an explanation as to why the relationship has broken down. My advice would be to talk to them, keep open dialog, and they will probably share more and more as time goes on. \n\nThey\u2019re really not handling your need for space well, so they suck too. Taking lunch money etc is just antagonising the situation. I also think they could cut you some slack and find some compromise to offer space in a safe manner.", "NTA\n\nLet's put this into perspective. Your entire life has been flipped upside down, and you seem like you needed a safe neutral space to process what is happening in your life ATM. Your parents are incredibly uncaring. They have had time to think this through and come to this decision (their divorce). Expecting you and your siblings to just accept it and adjust automatically is selfish. I'm so sorry you are going through this. Hopefully, your parents will realize this is something huge in your life that you need time to adjust to.", "NTA.

You did as good a job as any 16 year old could be expected to do in that situation. \n\nMaybe a short explanation as you packed would have helped, but it doesn't seem like your parents would have taken it well either way. I think it's fair to say they should have expected something like this to happen and been in a better headspace to accept you staying somewhere else for space/whatever. \n\nDon't let this affect the trajectory of your life. Shit may hit the fan, but make sure you do well in school and graduate. Make your parents pay for a therapist so you aren't carrying any conscious/subconscious baggage from this into the rest of your life.", "NTA, your parents had all the time they needed to process this new development and I'm sure they both leaned on their friends while they were adjusting to the idea of their marriage ending.

So I know they would be safe and fed. \n\nHowever, marriages can fall apart due to many reasons. This is probably a hard time for your parents as well.

The next steps are going to be contacting police because your friend's parents aren't in a position to say \"no\" to sending you home.  They are likely trying to avoid that altogether but it's going to be a very real outcome if your \"week\" turns into two weeks or more.", "They could just report them as a runaway to the police, get them and the friend they're staying with in trouble.", "Let's be honest, OP is a minor and isn't entitled to just go live somewhere else to \"cool off.\"  That's not a healthy way of handling this, either.\n\nBut suggesting the parents are \"absorbed in their own selfish world\" because they are getting a divorce and now are having to manage their family is completely over the top.  The fact that OP is completely surprised by this move is a sign that the parents are anything BUT selfish, because selfish people aren't afraid to air their dirty laundry to their children on the daily.\n\nAnd \"there won't be family to protect you from now on\"?  What are you, 13?  This is so melodramatic.", "Except for the fact that OP is a minor, and OPs parents are legally responsible. Also, hate to be this guy, but you don't control your parents relationship and they don't have to stay married to take care of you. \n\nYou don't control anyone's relationship. Sometimes things stop working - would you force them to be together? Ops parents don't have to stay together, but regardless of marital status they are OPs legal guardians. \n\nESH or NAH, depending on details I cant possibly know about OPs parents. OPs parents clearly lack emotional health and failed to model, instill or engage in healthy communication. This might not be their fault - often you model what is taught, this might be inter generational dysfunction. Fault also isn't a helpful way to view this: OPs parents were once kids who once had parents who clearly mucked up at least a bit, and now they're the parents mucking things up. \n\nIt's clear they're trying to work on being better people, and they bravely saw the truth - they can't be happy or grow with each other as life partners. It's also clear there's a lot of work to be done - draining OPs lunch account is desperate, childish and proves my whole point. The whole fam needs therapy, and OP needs to go home so they can start doing the hard work and becoming a better family unit, even if that means the parents are no longer sharing a bed (NOT that that is ANY of OPs biz IN THE FIRST PLACE). \n\nOp, might be good to explain to your parents WHY you took off. It looks like there's a lot more going in here.... as an older sibling who used to have similar convos with my little sister. \n\nIt seems given you and your siblings discussion, you might have been picking up some of the slack in raising them. Your family is so dysfunctional that you felt obligated to the kids, not the parents.... yikes kiddo, ypu should not have taken on any of whatever you had to take on. \n\nTaking on inappropriate parental roles can often coincide with something called \"emotional incest\" - usually the child, taking on the role of parent for the other children, begins doing it for the parents too. And you're not supposed to parent your parent till you're an adult, not because they're neglecting you but because they're aging. \n\nThis is probably why you reacted so strongly - your place in your parents relationship and marriage is more parental and less of a typical child relationship. I could be 1005% off-base here, and if I am ignore me, but I'd think about why you're actually mad OP - it's probably not the divorce, but the inevitable changes it will bring and their inability to include you yet again in another big, life altering decision leaving you to clean up the pieces and help your siblings... bring me to my next worry, who's parenting you? Who's helping you grow, who's hearing your worries, who's thinking of what's best? Who's helping you find your place in this crazy upside-down world of ours?\n\nIt doesn't seem to be your parents, given that once you got worried instead of trusting them with that worry you booked and found a friend who knew your emotional needs and did not question them. However, now that your parents are breaking up, maybe they'll get to become better parents. Please go home and at least give them a chance. I'm not saying they'll turn into Mary Poppins, but they should start to try to be better parents. \n\nYou deserve that - and if you don't get it from them, don't hold onto that bitterness. You will find a parent or two as you go through life when you need them, you just have to look. Sometimes it'll be a manager you weren't expecting, or a professor or TA who really gets you, or a local server or cashier who knows just what to say, or someone at church, or.... I've found tons of extra parents along the way, but I had to be open to the idea that my parents weren't perfect, no parent is and sometimes in life your only choice is to take what you get.\n\n Maybe their relationship was distracting them from their #1 job: taking care of and raising you and your siblings. That's my hope. Go home OP, and get some rest, but most of all remember you are NOT an asshole, you are someone who's growing and that's ok. You deserve love and family, at least you have your siblings - they must be hate not having you around, your parents are probably driving them bonkers.", "I hate comments like this. Out of all the parties the ones heavily effected is not the partners but the children, the least you can do is explain why or else they might just go on a self-blaming route of thinking they're the problem. \n\nIt's also disgusting that despite the parents showing abusive and childish attitude (taking out his lunch allowance), you still thinks it's better for OP to stay with his family.

He needs to talk to his parents, if for no other reason than to get food and discuss living arrangements. And probably therapy.", "I agree it can be for the betterment of the family. However, I think it's rich that the parents are calling out their son  for breaking up the family or whatever minor bullshit thing he did compared to their D-day.", "It's more about him being the emotional support, bc it's obvious these assholes for parents aren't capable of that..", "Seriously, there\u2019s no reason to get into specific details on why they\u2019re getting a divorce. Just because you\u2019re their kid doesn\u2019t mean you deserve some detailed explanation. The OP needs to grow up and go home and deal with it. Welcome to life, sometimes shit doesn\u2019t work out.", "This is a very valid point. Is this typical or atypical behavior, which we do not yet know.", "But op didn\u2019t do any of that, he doesn\u2019t need to be disciplined if the only thing he wants is a few days to process what happened", "Withholding food (as in a meal, not a treat) is manipulation. Don\u2019t believe me? Ask CPS.", "Child services has a pretty high bar for getting involved but withholding food is something they'd respond to.\n\nIf this kid needs to stay at a friend's house for a while to cool down, that may be the best thing for him. It's better than getting into shouting matches with his parents, punching holes in walls, it's a better option than a lot of other things. He's making a solid decision. It's not like he's squatting somewhere or going to a drug den. He's just trying to decompress and crash with a friend for a while. \n\nHe is also at an age where if he has a job or something maybe he could be emancipated. If he's more level-headed and responsible than his parents, child services and an 18b lawyer/law guardian actually may be able to help him.", "Telling him to come home?  Not abusive.  Just pretty ridiculous when he\u2019s still attending school and staying safely at a friend\u2019s house for a few days to deal with his parents blowing up the family.  After he made sure his younger siblings wouldn\u2019t be hurt by him spending a few days away.\n\nDefinitely abusive to remove his ability to Eat by draining his school lunch money account as a lever to Force compliance.", "Divorce is hardly D-Day, and they're not accusing him of breaking up the family, just being selfish. Which he is.\n\nI get that he's going through a tough time right now, but running away despite his parents' protest is a selfish thing to do.\n\nIt might have gone better for OP is he talked it out with them first, instead of just making a decision to leave.", "They wouldn't even explain *why* they're getting a divorce!\n\nThey might think it's just an end to their romantic relationship and therefore personal, but divorce is the end to their family dynamic *as they know it*, including the children. \n\nNot taking about this huge life upheaval is going to negatively affect their kids; it's already sent one kid searching for a safe place.", "So, OP's life gets uprooted and then does not have the right to an explanation? No need for gory details, but you can explain generally why? All he got was \"we're getting divorced\". He probably will go home after he clears his head. Grow up? 16... no need yet.", "Op can have all the food he wants. Come make a sandwich. There\u2019s no lock on the pantry.", "I\u2019m going to say something here that you\u2019re probably not going to like and I\u2019m going to get downvoted for but\u2026\n\nI think this has escalated to the extreme. I\u2019ve known people who\u2019ve been emancipated from their parents and it\u2019s definitely not something to be entered into lightly because your parents said you couldn\u2019t have a sleepover at a friends house (no matter the circumstance) or that you need to return home for lunch. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely something to be utilised in cases of abuse and if this post said anything that made me think it could be abuse then sure. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s up to the OP the path he takes and I definitely think the parents are wrong here (I would try to compromise on a safe place OP could stay away from home) but the parents do have a legal duty to ensure his safety, and if they feel that this friends house isn\u2019t suitable the responsible thing would be to have him returned home by the police or entered into formal foster care if that\u2019s what OP chooses. (Neither of those options are great either).", "They aren't withholding food though. They're withholding prepared school lunches. He could go home and get food so they doesn't qualify.", "Yeah. I just can't get on board with your opinion even though you have experienced divorce.\n\nPeople react to things in different ways. Some people don't see things coming.", "Exactly kids deserve to know, we constantly do wrong by them by counting out how intelligent their already are. They understand the basic dynamics behind a marriage and parenthood and deserve an explanation for why it's all changing \n\nParents who do this are delusional to feel better about themselves, without ever realizing that they're the ones fucking us up from this shit. \n\nMy heart honestly breaks for OP, i did the same thing and slept 3 weeks by my best friend bc i couldn't bear bbeing in that house and the world which crumbled around. Idk how it would have turned out if they had forced me back, it took 10 whole years till my parents and i were really back to being normal, but like that idk of we would ever reach that stage...", "You clearly haven\u2019t been in the situation.  I have.  Just because you\u2019re someone\u2019s child doesn\u2019t mean that you deserve the gory details of their relationship.  Most parents are not going to give that information to their child.  It\u2019s just going to be \u201cthings aren\u2019t working out anymore\u201d or \u201cYour mom and I don\u2019t love each other anymore and we\u2019re unhappy.\u201d  In all honesty, that\u2019s all that\u2019s necessary.  If a relationship has gotten to that point, it hasn\u2019t done so suddenly or quickly.  My daughter was 7 when her mother and I divorced and she dealt with it more maturely than this 16 year old has.  It\u2019s going to be awkward and there\u2019s nothing they can do to change that, but they really should be there for their younger siblings.", "No he doesn\u2019t have that right. Period. It\u2019s the parents business.", "I didn\u2019t see that in the post. Where did you get this information? Also, wouldn\u2019t that mean being late for school?", "I'm not saying he has to be happy about it, just that running away instead of talking to his parents is a terrible way of handling things.\n\nHeck, I'd have been totally on board with the staying at a friend's house thing if OP had talked to his parents about it first, instead of just telling them he's leaving.", "My sperm donor (should tell you something right there) told me, in graphic detail, about why he was leaving my mother and getting a divorce. I would have much rather not known that he was sexually attracted to me, who was 9 at the time, and that he had been cheating for years.\n\n This is an instance of the grass is always greener on the other side. Let me tell you, sometimes the greener grass is AstroTurf.", "Eh, I have been the kid whose life was uprooted without explanation. You clearly have not been in that situation. What you did was probably appropriate for your 7 year old, but older kids do need to understand a general reason for why their entire world is changing. Gory details, no. But he needs to be able to make sense of it.", "Oh so on top of being a bad father you're a liar. You never went through it yourself, you've just been the perpetrator. You have never been the child in the situation so you dont actually know what the experience is like. Just the same as you're accusing other comments of. Do better next time and don't out yourself as a liar if you're trying to maintain your bullshit high ground morality", "That business destroyed their family", "Okay, you got me there. However, OP made no mention of a lock on the pantry, or refrigerator, or any restriction of FOOD, just money. \n\nWhere in the post did it say they were restricting access to household food?\n\nWhy would it mean being late for school? There\u2019s nothing to indicate this.", "He's a kid and just found out his life will not be the same anymore. He's not 25 and honestly most 25 yr olds aren't mature. Yeah, I'm just not on board with calling him an asshole. I feel he deserves some empathy and slack.", "Dude i explicitly said that you shouldn't detail everything and yours is clearly a special situation to begin with, so fuck off with that. Context is of course important but as adults we can and should recognize to which degree we can include children in these difficult conversations. \n\nLike i guess your situation fucked you up good and understandably so, but most divorces aren't initiated bc one of the parents is a kid fucker. Most of the time it is bc the relationship isn't viable anymore, bc they drifted apart or even bc one cheated. And all of these, even the cheating, can be discussed with children, though that's should be more for teens, and can be en effective lessons for them going forward. Relationship can and do end all the time and normalizing a healthy way to conclude one is a valuable life lesson for everyone, especially for younger people who just haven't had these kind of experience and are now confronted with them through their own parents.\n\nEdit: btw my advice is also more geared towards parents who actually wanna do right by their child. Your dad is clearly a fucking psycho and shouldn't count towards that. Just wanted to make that clear.", "OK, so what if one of his parents was having an affair?  What if the facts will make him hate one of his parents?  To this day, I have not been completely honest with my daughter about the reasoning for our divorce because the facts would give her a different opinion about her mother and I don\u2019t want to do that to her.  We don\u2019t know the details.  Regardless, just because they\u2019re 16 doesn\u2019t mean they deserve any relationship details whatsoever.  99.9% of the time parents are not going to give relationship details to their kids, nor should they.  At that age, they should be able to handle it way more maturely and be a role model for their siblings, end of story.", "What exactly did I lie about?  I never claimed to be a child of divorce, but my parents did separate when I was a young boy.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Regardless, I do get to speak on the experience that I\u2019ve had with my daughter who is a child of divorce and who I know very well.\n\nEdit:  Also, I would love for you to tell me how I am a bad father, Lmao.  Protecting my daughter, yeah, I\u2019m such a bad parent.", "Well my cousin can attest that knowing doesn't always make it better. Sometimes it can build resentment from both sides (parent and child).\n\nThere is no one way to deal with divorce and everyone is going to suffer in some way. That's just the nature of things changing from the stability and knowledge someone firmly believed in (the family unit in this case).", "He says he is 16, and has a lunch account. These seem like clear indicators he is eating at a school. I could be wrong. Also, if he is staying with friends, he could eat at their place. This all leads to an indicator that they are limiting his ability to be fed while at school, thus manipulating him by refusing him food while at school. They are trying to give him to come home, by depriving him of a necessity, I.e. manipulation.", "Look, we're clearly never going to agree on this. But I will say this:\n\nOP is being selfish and an AH, but it's forgivable because he's 16 and going through a tough time.\n\nThat being said, OP needs to start communicating with his parents. Going MIA for a week despite their protests isn't helping anyone, including himself.\n\nHe deserves empathy and slack, but he also needs to start giving it, and he hasn't."]}
