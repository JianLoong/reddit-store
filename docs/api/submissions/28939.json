I don\u2019t blame you for leaving, but you don\u2019t have a choice about coming back since you\u2019re a minor. Your parents are handling this very poorly. They should be a lot more sympathetic about how upsetting this is for you, not cutting off your lunch money and telling you you don\u2019t care about the family.", "I'm sorry you're so upset. I can't say you're being unreasonable. You just sound sad and maybe a bit confused by the recent turn of events?\n\nJust make sure that your friend's parents are OK with you being over there? That's what might force you back home?\n\nNAH. I'm really sorry everything is so haywire for your right now.", "From what you say in your post, of course you're not the asshole. You're going through an incredibly difficult experience. If your parents had just been upset and concerned for you that would be one thing. But for them to turn it around and say you're letting down your family - that's awful. It's not your job as a 16 year old to be a comfort to your parents. It's their job to be there for you.\n\nHowever, in your title you say you went \"MIA\" for a week. \"MIA\" implies that people don't know where you are - the \"M\" stands for \"missing\" after all. That would not be OK, because even if your parents are acting like dicks (assuming they're not being abusive or anything), they do have a right to know where you are and know you're safe.", "It's not as straightforward as that. I don't think you're the asshole, but nobody is blame free here. I don't see how your parents can level the accusation that you don't give a crap about your family immediately after telling you that they are getting a divorce.\n\nIts not your responsibility to look after your siblings, it's your parents, and its also their responsibility to look after you too.\n\nTaking all the money out of your lunch account was a childish reaction and a way to try and regain control over you.\n\nHaving said all that -  you need to talk to them, for everyone's sake.", "NAH. \n\nMarriage is very complicated and you aren't privy to their marriage issues, even if you are their kid. Do you really want to hear about all the possible issues they could be having? They don't need to give you a reason.\n\nThey're unhappy in their marriage and have made a decision (one that was probably a long time coming) to end it. This is not easy for them, and they probably dreaded telling all of you.\n\nThat said, it's fair that you are upset and angry about it. I would have perhaps tried to approach it without anger, and asked if you could have a couple days with friends to get used to the idea.\n\nAs it currently stands, you're a minor and under their roof. So disappearing in a fit of rage is not a great answer to your problem.", "NAH. Being a teenager is difficult, and getting hit with this big change in the midst of it all is bound to be a shock to your system. I think you should go home for your little sibs because they will need you.\n\nDivorce is tough. I\u2019m sure your parents agonized over when and how to tell the three of you, and they probably have more to share about next steps. Your little sibs are probably worried, as you might be, about what the timeline looks like, where you will live (will your parents keep the house or sell and buy two different houses), when you will see each parent, will you stay in the same schools, etc. Maybe you can ask your parents these questions and reassure the littler ones that things will be okay. They will be. It\u2019s not a job you want to have, but they no doubt look up to you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this. There are lots of people you can talk to if you need to vent.

Your parents\u2019 relationship is their own business. \n\nJust know that you don\u2019t have to take sides; you don\u2019t have to make someone the bad guy. Hopefully your parents are mature enough not to badmouth each other to you and your siblings - if that does happen, just let them know that you don\u2019t want to hear it and walk away. It\u2019s hard going through this, but you can make it through to a calmer space.", "NAH  I\u2019m kind of impressed your parents didn\u2019t fight in front of their kids, or bad mouth each other to their kids. If you had worse parents you wouldn\u2019t have been blindsided like this. Trying to find the silver lining in this mess.", "NTA.\n\nOh, and if you tell an adult at school \"I can't  have any lunch today because my parents got mad and took all of my lunch money because I needed to get away at a friend's house so I could get myself together and not blow up at them after they told me that they are divorcing,\" then...well, your parents may well blow right the hell up at you even more, but you will also have shown them that from here on you will not keep secrets for them.  This is important to establish early with people who are breaking up (whether you are related to them or not) if they are both likely to see you as somebody to vent to.  Which is an extremely uncool thing to dump on your own kid and many couples who are breaking up manage not to stoop to it, but if they think that stealing your EATING MONEY is okey doke...\n\nETA:  OP, if you are not talking to your friend's parents about this, please do so right away.  I am speaking as somebody who had to send a child elsewhere for a while after a brain injury turned his father into somebody who was not emotionally safe for children to be around.  Coordinate with your friend's parents.  Prep them ahead of time with this information:\n\n* You did the mature thing and got your big feelings out of there before they overflowed onto anybody else\n\n* Your parents are accusing you of unlove because you did this and imply that it is your duty to be present for the upheaval--as if you were a fellow adult? caregiver? co-parent?  or something????\n\n* To repeat, they are talking to you like you have responsibilities that are connected to them getting divorced, like you are a peer?!\n\n* And then they yoinked your lunch money.\n\n* In short, you need an adult, or preferably a team of adults, so you can get your feet under you as your life changes drastically.\n\n* At this time your parents are not prepared to be those adults.\n\n* Also.  Talk a lot about your education.  About how you have two years to go before adulthood (assuming that is 18 in your area) and you need stability and not to be dealing with the emotions of grown-ass adults who seem to have temporarily (one hopes) forgotten that their divorce is not your mess to clean up.", "You're not responsible for the well being of the family unit. You are a child still. You need to focus on You and education. The adults (your parents) are responsible for the family and you. \n\nAs parents, we're supposed to shield our children from adult issues/problems so you can grow up to be better then us. Don't feel bad if they don't tell you the reasons for the divorce. I know you want to know and you will eventually but that's not for you to worry about. \n\nSeek therapy. It's a tough situation to go through. Especially at your age. Everything will be fine in the end. You don't want two bitter parents staying together and fighting all the time. That's worse.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re 16 so you need to be home if your parents say so, you\u2019re a minor and they\u2019re responsible for you. You also might not want to hear this but unfortunately they don\u2019t owe you an explanation as to why the relationship has broken down. My advice would be to talk to them, keep open dialog, and they will probably share more and more as time goes on. \n\nThey\u2019re really not handling your need for space well, so they suck too. Taking lunch money etc is just antagonising the situation. I also think they could cut you some slack and find some compromise to offer space in a safe manner.", "NTA\n\nLet's put this into perspective. Your entire life has been flipped upside down, and you seem like you needed a safe neutral space to process what is happening in your life ATM. Your parents are incredibly uncaring. They have had time to think this through and come to this decision (their divorce). Expecting you and your siblings to just accept it and adjust automatically is selfish. I'm so sorry you are going through this. Hopefully, your parents will realize this is something huge in your life that you need time to adjust to.", "NTA.  They\u2019re the AH for punishing you (taking your lunch money \u2014 who TF denies a kid lunch) for needing space to process all this.  \nInstead of punishing you, they should be offering to get you therapy.", "\"How dare you leave?

You did as good a job as any 16 year old could be expected to do in that situation. \n\nMaybe a short explanation as you packed would have helped, but it doesn't seem like your parents would have taken it well either way. I think it's fair to say they should have expected something like this to happen and been in a better headspace to accept you staying somewhere else for space/whatever. \n\nDon't let this affect the trajectory of your life. Shit may hit the fan, but make sure you do well in school and graduate. Make your parents pay for a therapist so you aren't carrying any conscious/subconscious baggage from this into the rest of your life.", "NTA, your parents had all the time they needed to process this new development and I'm sure they both leaned on their friends while they were adjusting to the idea of their marriage ending.

But you need to go home and face it. It\u2019s so tempting to run away at times like this and leave adults to deal with their mess. In a few more years you can. But for now, go home and ask your parents to put you and your siblings in therapy. Find a trusted adult to talk to.

Knowing there are couples mature enough to wait it out for the kids, ask your parents again who they think is the asshole.", "NTA.

So I know they would be safe and fed. \n\nHowever, marriages can fall apart due to many reasons. This is probably a hard time for your parents as well.

They want OP to be at home to help with the younger children which is ludicrous. OP is NTA.", "Should be top comment.", "About top comment.", "My parents were kind of the same way, and frankly it made the split that much more bewildering", "It sounds like OP's parents are trying to have some control in this situation -- but unlike others, I don't think this is a bad thing, because OP is a minor and OP just deciding they can check out and go live somewhere else is a little over the top.\n\nJust a warning to OP, but pulling the lunch money is most likely a \"shots fired\" to let you know you need to come home because they aren't going to bankroll your stay somewhere else.  The next steps are going to be contacting police because your friend's parents aren't in a position to say \"no\" to sending you home.  They are likely trying to avoid that altogether but it's going to be a very real outcome if your \"week\" turns into two weeks or more.", "They could just report them as a runaway to the police, get them and the friend they're staying with in trouble.", "Let's be honest, OP is a minor and isn't entitled to just go live somewhere else to \"cool off.\"  That's not a healthy way of handling this, either.\n\nBut suggesting the parents are \"absorbed in their own selfish world\" because they are getting a divorce and now are having to manage their family is completely over the top.  The fact that OP is completely surprised by this move is a sign that the parents are anything BUT selfish, because selfish people aren't afraid to air their dirty laundry to their children on the daily.\n\nAnd \"there won't be family to protect you from now on\"?  What are you, 13?  This is so melodramatic.", "Except for the fact that OP is a minor, and OPs parents are legally responsible. Also, hate to be this guy, but you don't control your parents relationship and they don't have to stay married to take care of you. \n\nYou don't control anyone's relationship. Sometimes things stop working - would you force them to be together? Ops parents don't have to stay together, but regardless of marital status they are OPs legal guardians. \n\nESH or NAH, depending on details I cant possibly know about OPs parents. OPs parents clearly lack emotional health and failed to model, instill or engage in healthy communication. This might not be their fault - often you model what is taught, this might be inter generational dysfunction. Fault also isn't a helpful way to view this: OPs parents were once kids who once had parents who clearly mucked up at least a bit, and now they're the parents mucking things up. \n\nIt's clear they're trying to work on being better people, and they bravely saw the truth - they can't be happy or grow with each other as life partners. It's also clear there's a lot of work to be done - draining OPs lunch account is desperate, childish and proves my whole point. The whole fam needs therapy, and OP needs to go home so they can start doing the hard work and becoming a better family unit, even if that means the parents are no longer sharing a bed (NOT that that is ANY of OPs biz IN THE FIRST PLACE). \n\nOp, might be good to explain to your parents WHY you took off. It looks like there's a lot more going in here.... as an older sibling who used to have similar convos with my little sister. \n\nIt seems given you and your siblings discussion, you might have been picking up some of the slack in raising them. Your family is so dysfunctional that you felt obligated to the kids, not the parents.... yikes kiddo, ypu should not have taken on any of whatever you had to take on. \n\nTaking on inappropriate parental roles can often coincide with something called \"emotional incest\" - usually the child, taking on the role of parent for the other children, begins doing it for the parents too. And you're not supposed to parent your parent till you're an adult, not because they're neglecting you but because they're aging. \n\nThis is probably why you reacted so strongly - your place in your parents relationship and marriage is more parental and less of a typical child relationship. I could be 1005% off-base here, and if I am ignore me, but I'd think about why you're actually mad OP - it's probably not the divorce, but the inevitable changes it will bring and their inability to include you yet again in another big, life altering decision leaving you to clean up the pieces and help your siblings... bring me to my next worry, who's parenting you? Who's helping you grow, who's hearing your worries, who's thinking of what's best? Who's helping you find your place in this crazy upside-down world of ours?\n\nIt doesn't seem to be your parents, given that once you got worried instead of trusting them with that worry you booked and found a friend who knew your emotional needs and did not question them. However, now that your parents are breaking up, maybe they'll get to become better parents. Please go home and at least give them a chance. I'm not saying they'll turn into Mary Poppins, but they should start to try to be better parents. \n\nYou deserve that - and if you don't get it from them, don't hold onto that bitterness. You will find a parent or two as you go through life when you need them, you just have to look. Sometimes it'll be a manager you weren't expecting, or a professor or TA who really gets you, or a local server or cashier who knows just what to say, or someone at church, or.... I've found tons of extra parents along the way, but I had to be open to the idea that my parents weren't perfect, no parent is and sometimes in life your only choice is to take what you get.\n\n Maybe their relationship was distracting them from their #1 job: taking care of and raising you and your siblings. That's my hope. Go home OP, and get some rest, but most of all remember you are NOT an asshole, you are someone who's growing and that's ok. You deserve love and family, at least you have your siblings - they must be hate not having you around, your parents are probably driving them bonkers.", "I hate comments like this. Out of all the parties the ones heavily effected is not the partners but the children, the least you can do is explain why or else they might just go on a self-blaming route of thinking they're the problem. \n\nIt's also disgusting that despite the parents showing abusive and childish attitude (taking out his lunch allowance), you still thinks it's better for OP to stay with his family.

I've been in this exact same position. I was 17.\n\nI had to get out of the house. I stayed at a friend's house (her parents and my parents were friends, too).

Most schools have funds to cover lunches for students in crappy situations.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, OP. It sucks. But it does get easier. I'm 45 now and I know ALL about the reasons behind their divorce. At 17 had I known what I know now, I would have been even angrier. White your parents don't owe you details, they do owe you decency. Screwing with your lunch money is incredibly controlling and borderline abusive. I hope you can get the support you need!", "NTA. Taking a few days away to process big emotions is a normal, adult reaction to a life upheaval like this. Staying with a friend is safe and won't interrupt your education. You will be gone for a short, defined time. It seems like you will be there for your siblings once you have gotten yourself sorted out - you can't help them process things you haven't processed yourself. In the meantime, your siblings have your parents to lean on. You're doing what's best for yourself AND your family imo.\n\nIt's understandable that your parents are upset, but they shouldn't have taken your lunch money. That said, if the police or CPS get involved, they will find you are not missing, having voluntarily taken yourself to a safe place, but as a 16-year-old being old enough to leave without your parents' permission will probably make you old enough to figure out your own lunch money. If you have any money of your own, I would recommend buying your own lunches, either through school or stuff to pack.\n\nTalk to the safe adults in your life. Make sure your friend's parents and your teachers are fully aware of the situation. Talk to the school counselor too. There may be extra support available to help you through this.", "NTA you asked for a couple days away to calm down after being told some big news there response was to empty your bank account?

Your parents have obviously had some pretty big issues for a while, have tried to resolve them but haven't been able to do so. \n\nAs sad and disruptive as it may be for you and your siblings relationships break down and end, it is possible that they made the decision not to explain why they are splitting up as they do not want you or your siblings to feel like you have to take sides, your running away could possibly cause further friction and resentments, my parents did the exact opposite and it caused a lot of damage and distress over the years. \n\nUltimately what you need to consider is you aren't the reason they are splitting up and as long as they maintain an amicable co-parent relationship you do not need to involve yourself further than they are currently comfortable with, and for these reasons in this situation you are being a bit of an a/hole, sorry buddy", "No judgement.

You were actually very considerate - talking with your siblings to make sure they would be OK!!! And letting your parents know what you wanted to do.\n\nThey are being aholish with the whole taking money out of your lunch account and being furious with you. You can imagine that they are under great stress and you moving out for a week would just add to their stress (so there is some room to forgive them IF they can calm down). And they need to recognize that this is a shock and a great stress for you kids and that you needed to give yourself a little space to process their big news that is tearing your family apart.\n\nSome things that may help:\n\n* I noticed your wording about them not being open about things prior to this news. You need to know that THAT was normal and reasonable for your parents. What happens between a married couple is their business only and for them to work out in private. It would NOT have been appropriate for them to clue you in to what they were struggling with between them. It's also appropriate for them to - even now - keep quiet about why they are breaking up. Sometimes the reasons are complex and subtle; sometimes one person or both people did things that clearly damaged the marriage - but they don't want the children to be burdened with taking sides or having a damaged relationship with a parent. Your parents are doing a good thing and a good job of keeping their issues private and not involving you kids.\n* Your parents may have freaked out about you leaving because they see you leaving as (1) adding to the breaking up of the family or (2) you being out of control Some key words from you may help them calm down.\n\n1. *Mom and Dad, I don't mean to upset you. I just need a little space to process everything. You two have had months to get here. Please understand that I also need a little time. I'm not doing anything crazy.*\n2. *Please share with me what you are worried will happen if I take this week to give myself some time and space. Please know that I've talked with little siblings to make sure they are OK with me being away.*\n3. *This is hard for all of us and can be overwhelming sometimes. Will you arrange for us to get some family counseling? I think it might help all understand each other better and handle things better.*\n\n* If your parents don't get a handle on their emotions regarding you kids, then please reach out to trusted adults around you (maybe an aunt/uncle or grandparents or a teacher/counselor, or some friends of your parents or parents of your friends, a church leader if you go to church...) Don't stop looking for support until you get some. If nothing else, insist on your parents letting you (and your siblings) see a therapist.\n* Also, be prepared that your parents are going to be doing things differently and making choices that are new for them. That's pretty normal for people divorcing. You don't have to like all the changes; you want to be honest about how you feel about things (and hopefully your parents will let you do that). Just also keep in mind that things will be better in general if you approach it with respect and grace (and ask others to give the same to you).", "NTA, and I'm sorry that your parents are and have tried to parentify you as the eldest sibling.

Most people do not get married with intention of separating later.

Whatever reason for your parents divorce, even without saying exploring why, it's important that children don't think it's *them*. So even if not for YOU, for your siblings the parents should have at least informed you guys that it isn't your fault and reassured you in that way.\n\n2. It does sound from what you've said that the parents may be expecting you to \"take care of\" your siblings. Even if they don't mean literally in the sense of feeding or babysitting, it sounds like they expected *you* to be the emotional support. Either of your siblings, or (what I think is worse, but may just be cuz it hits home more for me) for *them* (the parents). If your parents ever try to lay any emotional weight on you that is *theirs* (\"oh I just don't understand how he/she could do this to me,\" \"oh I'm just gonna struggle so much now dealing with xyz situation\", some of these can be just venting etc, but arguably a parent shouldn't vent to there child. Esp about their divorce.) If they try to do that, then (do your best to) tell them they need to seek an actual therapist as that is not your job. Nor, honestly, though I know this might come across as offensive to you, but you are mentally/emotionally at 16 NOT PREPARED to handle other people's problems. The fact that your parents put any of this pressure on you in the first place is dirt. \n\n3. My parents divorced at 23ish, and while I was \"fully formed\" according to science etc, there was a LOT of mental/emotional turmoil that came from it for me. So imagine a quarter of your life EXTRA experience in the world, and it's still a struggle. So yeah. Of course you need space. Someone in comments mentioned \"he doesn't have to leave the house, if he needs space he can go to his room\" or something along those lines, but having an invasive as HELL parent, I understand that may not have been possible. We don't know you. We don't know what's going on, not only in your life, but hell in your emotions. Certain people don't have a right to instantly be telling you to \"grow up\" or \"get over it\" or whatever other shitty things people are saying.\n\n\nLook, in the end, I would *suggest* that you do try to keep in touch with your siblings. If there's anything you're worried about happening to you in the house, that could potentially fall too them with you being gone. It is NOT however, your JOB, RESPONSIBILITY, or DUTY to take care of them, mentally or emotionally. It's your parents. They may be divorcing each other, but no one said they were divorcing/ditching the children. Children are STILL the parents responsibility even when the parents split. \n\nI know you're almost an adult anyway, and some might say \"close enough\" but this is one of those things that DOESN'T need to fall on you. Do not let your parents A) use you as a therapist, or B) parentify you even if \"only for the last two years\" of your childhood. It's still not YOUR responsibility. \n\n\nNTA.

A relative or friends parents!", "True, 16 is also more than old enough to get a job and buy your own lunch, I just added my comment because thread OP seems to think the friends' parents could be in legal trouble for harbouring a minor who belongs with his parents and that depends entirely on jurisdiction. In mine, OP would be allowed to stay with them forever if both parties agreed to it.", "Parents shouldn\u2019t go around using the D word until they\u2019re sure, they weren\u2019t necessarily lying about the sleeping thing.

They\u2019ll take them to a detention center first. \n\nUsually it doesn\u2019t get to that level tho. Usually the cops will talk both sides down and try to de-escalate in one direction or the other (definitely not always toward kid going home). \n\nParents who call the cops screaming about how their 16 yr old who was just informed of a divorce with zero explanation needs to be home to support the family they just informed him no longer exists so they therefore removed his lunch money aren\u2019t going to win much sympathy from the cops in many jurisdictions. \n\nI can tell you here in western NY they\u2019d basically say if you know where the kid is and the house they\u2019re staying at isn\u2019t forcing them to stay there and there\u2019s no risk of them being hurt or doing anything illegal (porn, drugs) they suggest you wait until Monday and call a family therapist to work things out through social services. They absolutely will not absent a clear and present danger go to someone\u2019s home and threaten them with kidnapping because their teenager has a friend whose parents are nuts staying the night.", "Because people on this sub are immune to critical thinking.

He's 16 not 6. He's old enough to relatively understand but maybe not his siblings but his siblings are 11 and 13. So they'll understand to an extent. He's hurt because this changes so much. They have to get used to having two birthdays, two Christmas's, possibly two Thanksgivings,etc. That is if they celebrate those holidays. If not, then it doesn't apply. But then they have to essentially spend every other week/weekend with either their mom or their dad depending on who gets sole custody of the kids. This changes their family dynamics. They have to live with ghost of what once was and what will never be. They have to get used to one parent no longer being in the house whichever one leaves. It's not a temper tantrum. He's hurt and confused because it's all happening so fast. As far as he and his siblings knew, everything was relatively okay.", "The judge will try their best to hold back laughter and use it as a story at the next dinner party. \u201cGet this\u2014 this 16 yo tried to convince me his parents were abusive because when he ran away, they said he had to bring lunch from home! This kid tried to convince me that they were \u201cwithholding food\u201d from him, in \u201cdereliction of their parental duties\u201d to feed him!

Either way I wouldn't call lunch money funding a runaway, I mean it hardly compares to hotel costs or flights, the kind of expenses a real runaway might use. But I agree he should already know how to make lunch and already have a job, some parents don't let their kids have jobs though. \n\nSounds like he is helping himself, he's overwhelmed with his feelings and needs to be away from his parents.

Their child ran because children are idiots with zero life experience to know that out is not magically safe. They're trying the non-cops route. And no, it's not 'on paper'. It's the parents who decide. The cops don't press the charges, the parents do, like with all domestic issues. Wake up and stop giving this **child** terrible advice.

This isn't abuse, this is a divorce.", "Imagine that they don\u2019t call them \u201cscreaming\u201d. They call them calm and explain the situation exactly as it is\u2014 they told the 16 yo that they were divorcing, he said he was leaving for a week and they said no, that they will go through this together as a family, he ran away to a friends, and refuses to come back, and now it is time for him to come home. They tried not going to the police but they are well past \u201ccooling off time\u201d and he is still refusing to come home, so they are going the official route. \n\nThere is nothing about \u201csupporting the family\u201d\u2014 Reddit added that part. \n\nIf the police where you are wouldn\u2019t go and try to pick him up saying , \u201ccome on, kid, time to go home\u201d, then that\u2019s both sad and remarkable.", "That isn't his job, he is still a fucking child!", "Explain what? \"We don't want to be married to each other. End of.\" No reasons necessary, no finger pointing no blame game. It's none of his business the intimate details are theirs and none of his business.

His ability to eat is the same as almost every kid\u2019s \u2014 food at home. Food at home to pack for lunch. The idea that they \u201cremoved his ability to eat\u201d is laughable. \n\n\u201cForce compliance\u201d.. oh you mean come home from running away? Yes, children often come home from running away when they get hungry. Sometimes it\u2019s later that day when they made it all the way to the corner.

Could be they got married because of the kids and remained for that reason.  Could be money, infidelity, emotional or maybe one of the parents had been in the closet.  And still not ready to come out to the kids.", "It's possible one parent was having an affair. Maybe a parent is gay? Maybe one parent has done something illegal. I'm sure it will come out eventually. The parents need time to put some kind of spin on it yet as it involves admitting weakness to their kids.", "There are reasons for a divorce I would not share with children. Such reasons can cause parental alienation and for the mental health of the children. Honestly, sometimes it's NOT their business why Mom and Dad don't want to be married any longer. It just is.\n\nThe parents should offer mental health help with appropriate professionals for their children. Hopefully they'll also get some information about how to navigate parenting through a divorce.\n\nStepping away can help sometimes. As you get older though, running away from your problems isn't always the best plan.\n\nThreats to steal funds was a childish retaliation on the parents' part.", "Yeah. Even if it\u2019s something to do with cheating or drugs or whatever and they don\u2019t want the kids to know they can say some generic \u201cwe grew apart\u201d crap! But to refuse altogether? That just freaks kids out.", "Sometimes there are also things that the kids really don't need to know and would be TMI.  They especially don't need to know if the reason is bedroom issues, because they don't need those images in their heads.  Sometimes, as much as you think you might want to know you really shouldn't get an explanation of what goes on in a marriage behind closed doors.\n\nAlso, the kids are still going to have to deal with both parents the rest of their lives.  Unless it's really bad enough for someone to get sole custody, it's better they not be told something that's going to make them hate one of their parents, especially if it's still going to be years before they're old enough to have a say in their custody.", "Exactly.", "You must be the mom then if you\u2019re going to defend such bs. Both parents need to grow tf up and stop acting like petulant children when they expect their oldest to be a \u201ccounselor\u201d for the younger two cause they can\u2019t get their shit together.", "No, I never said they would starve him at home, just that their being abusive by preventing him from eating RN.

I mean, the romantic relationship between his parents aren't OP's business. He isn't owned a explanation or justification why they parents are divorcing. Sometimes relationships don't work and that's all the explanation there is.", "I agree. Marital issues should not be shared with kids. Very often in a divorce each spouse blames the other and sharing \u201creasons\u201d with kids is essentially asking them to choose sides. \n\nBut you can still explain why without going into detail. \u201cWe were making each other very unhappy\u201d is usually at once true, obvious to the kids and appropriate to say.", "Just because something is uncomfortable for the parents, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201cbeyond\u201d teen\u2019s understanding.", "It\u2019s important to treat it as a case by case basis. Getting a therapist involved is not a bad idea either. Age appropriate is also a concern. My daughter was 3 when we split and 5 now.

She knows we don\u2019t love each other anymore but that we\u2019ll always love her and that\u2019s good enough for now.

Hopefully they\u2019ll be able to discuss it soon.", "They could very well have done that. I totally get that OP is a distraught teenager, so I wouldn't fault him for it.

It says op talked to sibs and decided to leave.  After the parents refused to justify the divorce to OPs satisfaction. The parents do NOT owe OP the answers they think they want. Doni think parents might be a h. Maybe. Not enough info. But the ADULTS not sharing their adult business and fights with the children is not wrong. As far as canceling the money. Yah maybe a bit of a dick move but it's not \"child abuse\"  and it's rather a dickmove that OP expects to runaway and go Mia for a week but expect parents to fund it. Nope. Nope. Nope.\nIt sounds like the parents are attempting to get their shit together privately without airing out all their dirty laundry. \nI'm not the mom in the scenario...but I am a mom of 12 and I don't share my private business with ANY of my children even the now adult ones. My home is NOT a democracy and my marriage is between my husband and myself.", "In what world is not paying for him to eat out for lunch abuse? If he\u2019s hungry for lunch he can go home and pack a turkey sandwich.", "Sigh. You are conflating so many things at once.\n\nSpousal/partner financial abuse is different from child financial abuse, with one major difference being the underlying agency the abused person should have over the finances. You are mixing together factors from different requirements/tests. \n\nWith the \u201cWithholding funds\u2026\u201d explanation, there is an underlying assumption which you are ignoring that the abused child does not have access to the basic needs items already, like medicine and food and the us the withholding of funds means withholding access to the items themselves. OP *does* have access to food \u2014 at their home, where they live. \n\nYour overly broad application of these definitions would call it financial abuse if my child wants to buy a sandwich from a store, and I say no, that they have to wait until we get home in 20 minutes, where we will have lunch from the food items at home, at lunchtime. I *am* refusing to provide funds to obtain basic needs\u2014 a sandwich. \n\nBut the definition/test doesn\u2019t apply because I am already providing the basic needs items, so the funds aren\u2019t necessary. This is true even if I am providing them via a means other than the one the child would prefer (store bought v provided at home). \n\nSame here. The funds aren\u2019t necessary because the OP can just go get food at home\u2014 the safe and warm place his parents are currently providing food, shelter, and medicine, which they want him to return to.\n\nThis would be different if the same situation applied to a partner, or spouse, who has or should have equal agency as me in controlling the manner of providing those basic needs.
