Their relationship has been solid and their relationship started getting pretty serious. Last month my friend called me and he was upset because my son had cheated on his daughter. I was taken aback and thought there had to be some kind of misunderstanding. \n\nMy son tried to explain that everything was a lie and she was just trying to ruin his image. I initially believed my son and went to go and confront my friend. At this point, his daughter showed us an entire folder of evidence against him. It looked really bad and I went home ashamed to even show my face to them. \n\nMy son eventually admitted that most of what she was saying was true. I also pulled up the text logs from our phone provider to check the validity. I put off dealing with the situation as I had to travel overseas for work and didn't have time to investigate this. After I got back in town, I decided that I would take away the car that he had gotten on his 16th birthday. I decided to gift the car to his ex and I contacted my friend to fill out the paperwork. \n\nHe agreed on a time for us to deliver the car and I made my son come with me to hand deliver it. When we got to my friend's house, his daughter had her new bf and a few friends over. My son begged me to not make him give the keys in front of all her friends. I didn't really care and wanted to make sure he was shamed for what he did. He is complaining that this ruined his life but that was kind of the goal. He can no longer drive to work so he had to quit his job. He doesn't need the money as I pay for everything. He will have to wake up an hour earlier for school to catch the bus and he has to wait an extra hour to catch the bus back home. I wanted to show him what could happen if you cheat in a more high stakes relationship. AITA here? \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689733783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153i4nl/aita_for_giving_my_sons_car_away/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Humiliation and having him lose his job is not the way to go. This may destroy the relationship you had with your son. You and your friend should have left these 2 deal with it on their own, they are not little children.", "What the fuck is wrong with you? YTA a hundred times over. You're not a parent. You're a bully.", "YTA\n\nHe received the car as a 16th birthday present? I get that technically you would be the R/O but you gave it to him as a gift. \n\nThe ex has moved on from this relationship. You made your son hand her the keys in front of her new bf and friends. You humiliated him. This was not shaming him for cheating. This was you trying to save face with your friend.\n\nHe either learned his lesson about cheating by losing the relationship or he didn't.\n\nDo you seriously think in future relationships he's going to think, \"I shouldn't cheat on this person because I might have to give her my car.\"? Betray my girlfriend? \ud83e\udee4 Find myself single? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Give her my car as a consolation prize? Now that's a bridge to far!", "Yta. Extraordinarily so. WTF. This is your kid. Kids make mistakes. Way to ensure your kid knows you will never have their back and to hide any mistakes from you forever going forward. Never going to you for help or guidance. You are 100 times TA he ever was cheating as a teen in a teen relationship that was never any of your business to investigate or get involved in whatsoever. You stole a gift, intentionally humiliated him, etc. You never made any mistakes as a teen? What the hell kind of ungracious and sadistic arrogant person are you? You valued trying to impress your equally busybody friend over your own son. This could\u2019ve been handled so much better, privately, with a real conversation about integrity and asking him what kind of man he wants to become. Then you stay the heck out of it. You should be his soft place to fall, the person he can go to when he makes mistakes and needs support to best learn from them. Your behavior was genuinely shameful.", "YTA cheating and lying about cheating is not ok. However, you and the other parents need to stay out of their relationship.  Teenagers are often stupid. They are figuring out how to be in a relationship, which means they will screw up. Make him go apologize in person? Sure. Give away his birthday present car???? Too much", "YTA and an awful parent", "YTA.  Gifting his car to his ex when she has a new boyfriend already?  Seriously?  Sounds like she got over it pretty fast.\n\nSure he was shitty with what he did, but this was not your business - it was their relationship, and his life - if he wants to be a shitty boyfriend he will soon learn that no one will want to date him - this action was more about you saving face for yourself, not for him.  If he is old enough to be in an adult relationship, then he is old enough to deal with his own messes.  He is still growing up - he will make mistakes, as we all did at that age.", "YTA. \n\nThis was not the way to handle a teachable.  Yea, your kid had shitty actions. Humiliation was not the move. You were supposed to be the adult here. You and your friend should stay out of children\u2019s relationships.", "These are kids.  He was in a 2 year relationship at 17? Yeah this was never going to break cleanly but this is when you can make these mistakes and learn from them. \n\nBut you took an expensive present and made him give it to an ex in front of her new bf and her friends, at an agreed upon time which she (ex-gf)  purposely stacked to humiliate your kid. And you allowed it. He then had to quit his job and lose sleep to take public transportation? HE\u2019S A KID. \n\nYou did this to save face with a friend that won\u2019t matter in a few years anyway. And you broke and humiliated your son over something that could have been taught in a million other ways. You need to fix your relationship with your son, because in the end, it\u2019s the only one that matters and you did everything wrong. EVERYTHING.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your sons relationship is not actually any of your business. Yeah, cheating sucks. But this is not the way you teach a kid.", "[removed]", "YTA. If the car was his birthday gift, giving it away was a duck move.\n\nAlso unbelievable that you got into his high school relationship; this isn't something to punish, it's something to talk about.\n\nOften people model the behavior they see.", "YTA.  While you can and should talk to your teen about why cheating is wrong, your punishment was over the top.  Public humiliation, taking away his property, taking away his ability to work, taking away his independence\u2026that was a lot.  The punishment should be related to the wrong and proportional to the wrong, and this was neither.  You could\u2019ve temporarily taken his keys and used your words to explain that if he cheated in a marriage, that could cause a divorce and the permanent loss of his security and possessions rather than the temporary loss of his punishment, instead you tried to make things as bad as if he\u2019d cheated on a spouse in an adult relationship.  You\u2019re supposed to teach your kids with lower stakes than if they make the same mistake with the rest of the world - enough to learn, but not permanent losses.", "YTA\n\nTheir realtionship is none of your business. Way to alienate your child.\n\nAnyways, you'd be a theif and a bad parent if I didn't think you were a straight up liar about taking their car and giving it to their ex. \n\nThe repercussions alone between those two would be terrible. If I was your son not only would I tell everyone about this but any time I saw the car I'd damage it.", " YTA you just proved to your son that your friendship was more important then him.\n\nYou didn\u2019t teach him a damn thing other when push comes to shove you will humiliate him to make yourself look better. I hope like hell your friends daughter takes care of your ass because as soon as your son is able he will go no contact with you.\n\nYour no more than a bully! Congratulations this show of friendship to your buddy lost you the respect of your son!", "YTA.\n\nHe screwed up, and lost his girlfriend. YOU, on the other hand, have likely lost any hope of a good relationship with your son. You and your friend should have kept your noses out of their business, except to counsel each of your respective children on how to handle these situations later in life. You really, truly fucked up!", "YTA Why are you punishing him? He didn't cheat on you. It isn't any of your business.", "YTA . Your his parent your suppose to love him unconditionally. His messed up that\u2019s true, but when that happens as the parent you\u2019re supposed to turn it into a teachable moment and explain the impact of of his actions. \n\nHe\u2019s a teenager he is going to make mistakes you need to be the safe place he can turn to in order to learn from them, you could have made him apologize to her, and grounded him for lying to you , cause it was their relationship and him lying to you made you potentially get in a fight with a friend but that\u2019s about the limit of what he should be in trouble for. instead you went way too hard and now all you showed him was you don\u2019t have his back, that you prioritize your friend over him and not to come to you in the future, cause you will publicly humiliate him without care for his feelings.", "YTA. Give it time. Because soon enough your son is going to cut ties with you and never speak to you again. What you did wasn't parenting. It was a BS move that has all the hallmarks of a bully. You humiliated him on purpose. What does that teach him other than the fact that his parent is an AS and that he won't ever be able to trust you again? As I can guarantee that he won't. So don't start crying when he drops you like a bad habit.", "YTA. Your son did an immature thing, and you gave away something that DID NOT BELONG TO YOU. (I mean, if it was a gift for his 16th birthday, it was his.) You irreparably damaged your relationship with your son to give a car to a girl that already had moved on with a new boyfriend. Who's to say she did have that boyfriend earlier, too? \n\nYes, he was an idiot to cheat. But you were an AH to treat your own child that way. Yell at him. Tell him he's a fool. Make him publicly apologize to her. But to take away a car??? That is too much. Ridiculous. You care more about shaming your son than about teaching him what love looks like.", "YTA", "YTA. Someone needs to punish and publicly humiliate you for such horrible parenting. \n\nThe second your son can, he'll be gone and you'll never hear from him again. I hope your friendship was worth losing your child.", "YTA. punishments need to fit the crime, so to speak. the car was unrelated to the cheating. i think a better move would\u2019ve been making him apologize to her (maybe even on social media because social backlash is arguably relevant enough) and ground him for a period of time (so he can\u2019t find another girl to cheat on as easily, idk).", "YTA, this isn\u2019t real. it can\u2019t be. Lol", "YTA--your son is 18 and can make mistakes, he's an adult.\nI can't see how you trust you again.\n\nAnd I would think as a parent you would want your son to grow up to be sufficient.  Using proud of the fact that he lost his job as he doesn't need his money.", "YTA and I think you provided all the details here because you thought you\u2019d get a bunch of applause from internet strangers. You had the opportunity to talk about this with your son and teach him about proper behavior but you seem to enjoy the humiliation you put him through.", "YTA this was a situation between your son and his ex, there was absolutely no reason for you or your friend to get involved, nevermind giving his ex his car as a consolation prize.", "Man I honestly appreciate and understand the sentiment but you took it too far so YTA... I have been cheated on by my spouse and it was devastating so I get that you wanted to show him how seriously damaging his actions can be. I also get that your point was that if he did this in a marriage he could easily lose half of his assets in a divorce.\n\nBut man the stakes aren't that high right now, he's a kid and kids need a whole lot of grace. I do believe he should have been punished, and yes you should use this as a teachable moment, he needs to realize there are consequences to his actions but you went nuclear!  I also think how far you went has a lot to do with it being your friend's daughter, I feel like you were trying to save face rather than teach your son how to treat a partner. \n\nYou can show your disappointment for your kids actions but he is still your kid and he needs you on his team, that doesn't mean supporting his bad decisions but it does mean you won't make the situations he puts himself in even worse, like you did in this instance. \n\nAlso did you really listen to your son when he tried to tell you the full story? The girl has already moved on which does happen with highschool relationships but it also says she could have been just as unfaithful as your son (not that it's an excuse) but he could have been trying for some kind of revenge. You gotta listen and give the best advice you can, your job is to steer them in the correct direction and make the path they are on easier not more difficult.", "YTA. This was not your relationship to get involved in. Nor to shame your son because you were embarrassed. Your role would have been to be a *father* to your son and have discussion around why cheating is not something solid, respectful people do, why an appropriate reaction would be for him to apologize - in private - to his ex, how he can work on himself to be a better person, etc. This was such an egregious action on your part, I don't know if your relationship with your son can ever come back from it.", "Hope you enjoy the shitty nursing home you end up in. This was a teachable moment but you are only concerned with loyalty to your friend. \n\nYTA, and a terrible parent.", "YTA, this is the worst one I have read. Hopefully it is fake", "You\u2019re a horrible parent wtf YTA YTA YTA. A simple scolding wouldve done it well or just making him apologize to the girl.\n\nWas he shitty for cheating? Absolutely. But you stretched it to the point he has no job, a ruined social life, and now has to struggle to get to school. You couldve gone so many ways and chose the worst possible \u201clife lesson\u201d. YOUR the asshole.", "YTA and your relationship with your son is effectively dead. Since you decided that humiliating him for cheating was the way to go,  good luck getting him to do anything for you from now on unless you're willing to do more disturbing and depraved things in an effort to coerce him.", "YTA - your his father, this was grossly I inappropriate.  You didn\u2019t reach him a lesson and this was grossly out of proportion. You gifted him that car, even if it was in your name, it was ethically and morally your son\u2019s car you stole.  You then publicly humiliated him like this is the scarlet letter.  You then proceeded to screw him over professionally by making him lose his job and income.  Then you screwed him academically, as losing an hour of sleep and an hour to do academics due to transportation is going to hurt him.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a high stakes relationship, it was high school, and the girl has already moved on real fast.  This was just about you saving face with your friend and intentionally hurting your son(not teaching him).\n\nYou\u2019ve likely ruined your relationship with your son.  He 100% won\u2019t come to you or tell you the truth going forward.  I expect him to go NC.\n\nYour friend is great tho.  He got his daughter a new car to go with her new boyfriend, and probably ruined the rest of your sons highschool life.", "YTA \n\nCongratuliations on losing your son and future grandchildren. Great Job.\n\n\nWhat made you Even think this was appropriate???", "YTA, because DAMN, SON. You should have had him apologize and then scrub all the floors in the house, but give his CAR to his EX? Are you kidding me? \n\nDude. I get it, cheating is awful, but he isn't going to remember that cheating is bad from this. He is going to remember to be more sneaky with you because you will show zero amount of mercy to him fucking up. \n\nThe only high stake relationship at here was between a father and his son, and bro, you have really risked it with this move.", "Look, I can see why you did what you did, but it really wasn't your business to be getting into.  And giving the car to your son's ex who had already moved on was a really assholian move.  Are you going to be getting into his business in ALL his future relationships?  YTA.  A massive AH.", "YTA\nI get that what he did was wrong, but he's a kid. Which means he gets to make mistakes and do things wrong", "YTA\n\nAnd you openly admit that ruining his life was 'the idea'.\n\nYou are not fit to be a parent.\n\nWhat has your son's behaviour got to do with your friend?. Their child is 18!  And their own boss.\n\nYour moral judgements are NOTHING to do with the car that you GAVE him.\n\nIt is his property and you have stolen it. And thus have arranged for him to lose his job!\n\nI wonder what your history in sexual relationships is and what you are projecting on to your son.\n\nI feel so sorry for your son.", "YTA. This is the time where people experiment and relationships do come and go. You wanted to show him what divorce is like - lose your job, lose your possessions - in a teenage relationship. Lucky, lucky GF - she's moved on and got a free car too. You made the stakes unrealistic. \n\nHe's likely learnt two lessons. Having possessions gives you power over him so why bother and don't get married. Suspect a few years later, there will be a post saying why doesn't my son settle down. \n\nInfo: are you divorced and bitter about it?", "YTA.   Don\u2019t get involved in teenagers love lives.   You can certainly give guidance and ask him to see things from others point of view, but it sounds like you were more embarrassed because it was your friend\u2019s daughter.    I foresee you son eventually getting another car and driving far away from you.", "YTA.  Instead of a teachable moment, you created what might be a permanent wedge in your parent-son relationship.\n\nWas your goal to punish him as hard as possible, impress yourself friend or help your son become a better person?", "Yta. And deranged. They were not engaged or married. His whole friend group are now going to be alienated from him. Dick move.", "Sounds like the gf was cheating and your son returned the favour. She was just so low to keep the evidence of his indiscretion where he was the better man. Why else would she already have a new bf when you went to deliver the car? Probably the one she was cheating on your son with. \n\nWay to go teaching your son to never get into a serious relationship again and just to use women for his own ends and treat them and throw them away like trash. \n\nAlso taught him to never accept, or give, a gift again for fear it would be taken away or that the meaning behind it is worthless. \n\nKeep going, maybe he will choose to cut you off because of your toxic, controlling behaviour when you need him most. \n\nYTA.", "What. The. Hell.", "YTA. You are way too involved in your son's personal life. The consequence for cheating on his girlfriend was losing his girlfriend. You attempting to ruin his life because you don't like how his relationship went is incredibly f***** up.", "YTA\n\nAll you\u2019ve done is cement his hatred of you. Hope you won\u2019t need him for your end of life care. \n\nThe relationship was between the two teenagers, and it\u2019s up to them to resolve it. You stepping in and *bull elephanting* your way through the situation is garbage. He\u2019s old enough to cheat, he\u2019s old enough to live with the consequences. Those consequences should NOT include losing his job!", "YTA. Man, this is the kind of thing your kid is never going to forget. You\u2019ve simultaneously taught him not to open up to you and not to take responsibility for his actions because the consequences might be insane. On top of humiliating him, forcing your way into his relationship, and making it to where he will probably never be comfortable around anyone involved in this situation again. This was extremely messed up.", "YTA. Who takes away a 2 year old gift from his son causing him to lose his job? He is 17 years old! He has many life lessons to be learned, but I hope he doesn\u2019t learn anything from you", "YTA. He is 16. A stern talking to about how to behave and treat women is sufficient at his age. You massively overreacted, and you cost him his job. Your friends are AH too for accepting the car and allowing such an extreme form of punishment, over something that has nothing to do with you. I guess your relationship with your friend is more important to you than your relationship with your son. I look forward to the update on how you intend to fix it.", "[deleted]", "YTA, also they weren't married", "yta - its one thing to teach your son about what happens to cheating etc but its quite another to do it to the point he had to quit a job because he cant drive there and now has no means to earn a way to buy himself one.  or move out when he hits 18 but i surmise he will find away to leave on his 18th bday whether he got money or not but i think u wont care by then anyway.\n\nfyi the only reason u did all that is because it was your friends daughter and u wanted to prove urself to the friend hope it was worth it", "Wtf yes YTA and the fact that you even have to ask makes you even more so. You are a horrible parent and one day you\u2019re going to wonder why your kid doesn\u2019t speak to you. I hope you go out and buy him a new car, like, yesterday as an apology.", "YTA. You can expect your son to move out ASAP, and stop speaking to you about 0.000000001 seconds after that.", "YTA,\n\nKids do stupid stuff. Just because you\u2019re embarrassed you give them his car? What\u2019s your thought process? It\u2019s really none of your business if he cheated on his GF in the first place. Not condoning the behavior, but yeah you\u2019re totally the a hole here.", "YTA good luck having a kid who\u2019s gonna go no contact with you the moment he can.  Thanks for showing me what not to do if I\u2019m in a similar situation with my son later on when he\u2019s this age.  If I was your kid, I\u2019d move far away the second I had enough money.", "YTA\nGifts of any value are not given conditionally. That\u2019s why they are gifts. To arbitrarily take them away, and in such a humiliating manner too. Jeepers.", "Id like \"well, that escalated quickly\" for 500, Alex.\n\nYTA. Vastly disproportionate punishment", "YTA. He's young and stupid. You gave HIS car away. Sure you might have been the legal owner but fuck.... your son now has no job, is extra tired, miserable and is going to resent YOU. Get that car back today. Scratch that, get off your rear end NOW, get the car NOW. Then you give the car back. There are other ways to show your disappointment. Either get the car back or buy him a better one. People like you get to their 70s and wonder why their kids don't talk to them.", "Good lord do you always suck up to your friends like this? Is this friend going to be around to give you access to your grandchildren or decide whether or not to put you in a care home? \n\nYour teenage son cheated. He needed to learn a lesson about that because he\u2019s at the age to learn about relationships, communication, how to have hard conversations, how to extricate yourself with minimal harm when you are over it. But you didn\u2019t teach him anything but what humiliation feels like and that he cannot count on you or look up to you. \n\nAnd this broken hearted princess, having already gotten mummy-n-daddy involved in her business, has now moved on with a new boy and, triumphant, had a little party come around to watch her victory lap, sponsored by you.

Your intentions are good however,\n\n-Taking away the car is too much. \n-Publicly shaming him is too much.\n-Forcing him to quit his job and making it harder to get to school is too much.\n\nYet You did all 3 combined. \n\nHe made a mistake, and whilst yes its your responsibility to teach him life lessons, you also have to support him through his mistakes", "YTA\nAnd super weird for getting in the middle of a teenage breakup.", "YTA if your son ever goes NC with you don't be surprised.", "YTA absolutely and utterly. This was not about teaching or correcting your son's actions, this is entirely about you trying to save face in front of your friend; by destroying your relationship with your son.", "YTA, I guess this is the beginning of the end of your relationship with your son. You won't be able to live this one down lady.", "YTA.  Are you seriously wondering why he lied and cheated when you act like this?  You are unhinged and should apologise to your son for being such an asshole.  And no doubt not just on this occasion.  What the hell is wrong with you?    The fact you say ' it's kind of the goal ' to ruin anyone's life let alone your own son is psychotic.  Get yourself to a counselor to unravel your own warped psyche and view on relationships which are in desperate need of a conscience.  Your friend is just as much of a weirdo for accepting the car.  Seriously I hope your son gets the hell out of dodge and away from you for the rest of his life.", "You have one out; if the car was yours, that he was using as his, you have the right to take it back. If the car is HIS (whether by gift or he bought it) you have no right to take it. Maybe legally, but not morally.

Buy your kid a new car, apologise to him for putting your profile ahead of his wellbeing.  How you  could think humiliating a kid in front of his friends was a good idea just proves what a crap parent you are. I would never trust you again if you were my Dad.

You are a major and total AH.", "\"He is complaining that this ruined his life, but that's kind of the goal.\" YTA, your role is to teach him that cheating is wrong not to destroy his life, what he did, and the lying was a big thing, but what you did was over the top just to make you look good to your friend.

Their relationship has been solid and their relationship started getting pretty serious. Last month my friend called me and he was upset because my son had cheated on his daughter. I was taken aback and thought there had to be some kind of misunderstanding. \n\nMy son tried to explain that everything was a lie and she was just trying to ruin his image. I initially believed my son and went to go and confront my friend. At this point, his daughter showed us an entire folder of evidence against him. It looked really bad and I went home ashamed to even show my face to them. \n\nMy son eventually admitted that most of what she was saying was true. I also pulled up the text logs from our phone provider to check the validity. I put off dealing with the situation as I had to travel overseas for work and didn't have time to investigate this. After I got back in town, I decided that I would take away the car that he had gotten on his 16th birthday. I decided to gift the car to his ex and I contacted my friend to fill out the paperwork. \n\nHe agreed on a time for us to deliver the car and I made my son come with me to hand deliver it. When we got to my friend's house, his daughter had her new bf and a few friends over. My son begged me to not make him give the keys in front of all her friends. I didn't really care and wanted to make sure he was shamed for what he did. He is complaining that this ruined his life but that was kind of the goal. He can no longer drive to work so he had to quit his job. He doesn't need the money as I pay for everything. He will have to wake up an hour earlier for school to catch the bus and he has to wait an extra hour to catch the bus back home. I wanted to show him what could happen if you cheat in a more high stakes relationship. AITA here? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OK, firstly you are WAAAAAYYYY too involved in the relationship of two teenagers. \n\nBut what did his car have to do with this?!

Who knows what else you will do if he messes up again - better to not be more dependent on you than absolutly necessary. \n\nLets be honest here, you didn't really care about the girl (or did i missed the part where you contacted her to offer her support?), you only cared about losing your face to your friend.

Op's response was harsh but I somehow doubt the idiot will repeat this kind of mistake, it's much easier to break up.", "If cheating and lying is ok with you then that\u2019s fine but for me there are consequences and his dad taught him this. And if he does this when married I hope his wife takes him to the cleaners and teaches him it again. Some people need a lesson taught a few times and while they are just 17 as you put it it doesn\u2019t excuse his actions his lying to his dad or his endangering his dads relationship with his best friend", "It isn't normal to be a piece of lying shit and to normalize it isn't okay.\n\nMistakes happen, they turn into who you are when you have no consequences for those mistakes.", "that is very true! and it is incredibly interesting the psycological aspects of it, i just found it to be a frankly stupid comment that focused on the entirely wrong point of the comment they were commenting on", "I mean, we are repeating over and over that there is a gender bias in this sub. I'm not surprised.", "It becomes their business when they get a call because of the shit he does?", "Where do you see he rushed and wanted to fight the friend?  \nHe had a chat with his son, and went to confront the friend because the son told him he didn't cheat so he want to go to the bottom of it. \nFollowing your reasoning, he should support the son (he does as he believes him), and at the same time it's the dad fault if he is embarrassed because he believed his son?!  \nNext you'll tell me it's the dad fault if the son cheated.", "Its ridiculous for the parents to be this involved. They\u2019re 17\u2026 These things are part of the territory in young love/relationships. Very few of us haven\u2019t cheated or been cheated on. It\u2019s a learning experience and one mom and dad shouldn\u2019t be navigating for you.", "His dad shouldn\u2019t be in his relationship to begin with, nor should he be checking text messages, etc. It\u2019s grossly inappropriate.", "And people learn from those mistakes, daddy never needs to take away the car, xbox, or the credit card. These teenagers learn all on their own that cheating, lying, and being duplicitous takes you down a very sad, lonely, depressing road.", "Neither am I. Not much we can do except spread the word though", "Does it? All my parents would have said was: \u201cyeah, I don\u2019t know.. theyll work it out or they wont, they\u2019re 17\u201d. \n\nthen id maybe get spoken to about treating people with respect.", "He's not 10. You don't call a 17 yo's parents over personnal conflict between him and your daughter.", "He literally says he goes to confront his friend right after talking to his son.  He could\u2019ve first asked his friend for evidence before confronting him.   The definition of confront is: meet (someone) face to face with hostile or argumentative intent.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to get to the bottom of it, he went to argue and push back, then got caught flat footed instead.\n\nYour making things up, I never said he should support his son, no one does, I am pointing out that this is vastly out of proportion.\n\nFollowing the reasoning I literally already said previsouly.  He should\u2019ve just called or texted for evidence before making any rash decisions.  Which he didn\u2019t do.  He embarrassed himself because he rushed to conclusions.  Hell why didn\u2019t he check the phone records BEFORE confronting his friend and the gf? Why only after he was proven wrong there and his son admitted it\n\nI don\u2019t know where your getting that last part.  I agreed with you that he could\u2019ve done a better parenting.  But my entire point was that the id was vastly out of proportion, and it was out of proportion because he messed up by rushing to conclusions and was embarrassed.\n\n\nOnce again why check phone records AFTER all facts were revealed and not INITIALLY.  Why not ask for evidence at literally the first step\u2026", "It isn't normal to cheat and lie in my home.  It is normal in your home.  That's okay for you, to each their own.  If my kid cheated, and then lied to my face like this, treating me like an idiot while trying to escape consequences, he'd learn real quick how stupid of an idea that is.  However, I wouldn't need to do something like this because we've had that attitude for his whole life.", "Awesome for you! Yay!!!", "On another note, they're 17 and ex already had another dude on her side. Point is, most adolescent relationships don't last an also people make mistakes and a lot of us do grow up and out of the teenage mindset about relationships and hurting others. It's a mixed bag, I know but the punishment didn't fit the crime in the case."]}
