When my siblings moved out my parents gave my the master bedroom but when Derek Sophie moved in I moved to a smaller room and they got the master bedroom. None of bothered me because there going through a hard time but Sophie gave me a schedule and saying this is (children\u2019s ) daily routine. I asked what she meant and she said it\u2019s for when she\u2019s at work. I told Sophie that I\u2019m not going to watch her kids and I never said I was. My mom told me that she meant to talk to me about it and basically because class is over and my parents work full time I should watch there kids. If Derek or Sophie asked me I would have said no because I work part time in the evening and I\u2019m really stressed but they could have at least asked instead of just assuming I would. Yesterday Sophie thanked me for watching her kids and left before I could say anything so I called my best friend and told her that my brother would pay her when he got home. I spent the entire day with my boyfriend and I got a call from my brother yelling at me saying that I put his kids in danger (my friend is getting a early childhood education degree does babysitting regularly and shes great with kids.) When I got home Derek and Sophie yelling at me saying that they couldn\u2019t afford a babysitter and that I\u2019m selfish I knew that if I just watched the kids they would do that all Summer.

Just because you are female and off from school does not make you their servant for the summer. They clearly will not pay you. Keep your job, this is their problem to work out. Get a daytime job and ask them if they will pay you that upfront before each week, I\u2019m betting no.", "NTA\n\nYou did say no. And had them dumped on you anyways. You arranged for safe care and did so in such a way that means it won't occur again.", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right. They are trying to push you into unwilling free childcare duty all summer for kids who aren't yours. I would not agree and I would let them know that you will be out of the house all day every day so they'd better come up with a paid babysitter to watch their kids or put them in actual childcare. And then make good on your promise and go to the library or a coffee shop every day for at least a week or two until they find someone to watch their kids. Not your responsibility.", "Go get the list of kids routines and put the cost of each on it, then give it back to them. \"Since you guys assume I work for you, here's my rates\".", "NTA, stand your ground.", "NTA and not your problem to supply them with child care. You didn't leave the kids home by themselves and found  a qualified and experienced babysitter for them. Their childcare issues are not your responsibility. Could you help out sometimes? Sure, but they can't possibly expect you to just do this for free whenever they want.", "NTA- start getting up early and make sure you\u2019re gone before everyone wakes up , dear.\n\nYour mom signing you up to be free childcare is ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m glad your dad has your back.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL need to find care for THEIR children. You said no to babysitting and have no responsibility for their life choices. They are having children that they cannot afford but that\u2019s not your problem to help fix.", "NTA not your circus not your monkey. Tell them the next time you can call the cops for\nAbandonment. I would also see about getting a full time job.", "NTA.\n\nNot your kids.  Not your responsibility.  While it would be nice to help out on occasion, they didn't even ask.  They just assumed their entitlement would prevail.  Wrong again!", "NTA. You've already said no. Why have children if they can't look after them.", "NTA, they're already getting help by living with your parents. You're an adult and deserve the respect from your family as one. Your mom made the agreement on your behalf without talking to you which makes it frustrating for you and for your brother and his wife. Your mom should have told Sophie and Derek that she will ask you and have you contact them with whether you can do it or not. \n\nYour mom is the AH. Sophie shouldn't have left her kids with you if you have already said you weren't available. That makes her an AH for that. No one babysits for free. Maybe grandparents do, but even then I know some who ask for some sort of payment. It sucks that they fell on hard times, but it's not your responsibility to get them out of it. It would be nice if you could watch them every once and a while but with how this situation turned out already, I wouldn't just because that might try to take advantage that you budged just a little. \n\nYour brother and his wife can look for financial day care help from the government. There are programs out there for situations like these. Maybe they should even do food stamps to help out with the groceries. \n\nStand your ground and be firm. You can tell them that you don't appreciate them trying to manipulate and guilt you into doing something that you aren't available for and wasn't asked before hand. Tell them they need to figure something out and this is on them.", "NTA. Your brother and his wife are in a tough spot, but that doesn't mean you're the implied child care provider. \n\nIt would be _nice_ to give them free childcare _sometimes_. But I would be very cautious about being the default, free childcare provider. It would also be _nice_ if they would ask! Even offer to pay. Doesn't have to be a lot - but I think it's nice to at least offer.", "Oh hells no. NTA\n\nEdit to say, the e s h people are out of bounds. The op has absolutely zero responsibility to the parents.

They  moved in but they still can't afford childcare? What were they doing before? Of course you shouldn't be watching them. Did your mom promise them you would and then just not mention it to you. Why did they think you would go along with this? \n\n>Yesterday Sophie thanked me for watching her kids and left before I could say anything so I called my best friend and told her that my brother would pay her when he got home.\n\nYou told her no. If anyone dumps their kids and runs off they shouldn't be surprised if another babysitter is called or if the police are called. ESH because you did potentially screw over your friend here.", "NTA. Their kids their responsibility. Not your kids not your responsibility", "Yeah so, your SIL left them and put the kids in supposed danger. Not you. BtW your mom probably told them, you would watch the kids.", "ESH. Nobody has the right to demand your time without consultation or consent. They fired the first shot here with that blatant disrespect.\n\nBut parents should always have the right to know who their kids are with and how to contact them in an emergency - so at the very least you should have messaged your brother and his wife with that info as soon as  you left the house so they could come home and resolve the situation immediately instead of just discovering it after several hours.\n\nYou also risked your friend giving up her time without getting paid because you had no idea whether your brother would make good on your promise that he\u2019d pay, so you\u2019re really no better than the rest of your family for making the assumption that he\u2019d be shamed into paying someone you hired at whatever rate you agreed with your friend.", "ESH Your entire family could have avoided this situation by openly communicating with each other.\n\nNo one in your family should have assumed you would provide unlimited free childcare and they should have gotten your agreement before leaving the children with you. You are TA for leaving the kids with a stranger (to the parents) and saying your brother would pay without even knowing for sure if he had money available to do that. It's understandable you were upset that they didn't have a proper discussion with you. But blowing off the obligation they expected you to fulfill for something as frivolous  as hanging out with your BF could easily be seen as irresponsible if your Mom said you would be providing childcare. You should have watched the kids for the day and then had a direct conversation with your brother when he got home.\n\nIf your brother is in such a dire situation, why wouldn't you be supportive? Part of being in a functioning family is helping each other when needed. How many times has your brother done things for you? And your parents? It is not unreasonable for them to assume some level of help from you, especially if you are living at home for free or for a small amount of rent compared to what you'd pay if you lived outside of their house.\n\nExpecting you to essentially be an unpaid nanny is wrong. But there is no reason you shouldn't be willing chip in and at least help with the kids occasionally. If your brother is in such bad financial straights, your family should work out a schedule for watching the kids with everyone contributing so that babysitting cost can be kept to a minimum.", "ESH. It made me mad reading what they did to you after you told them no to watching their kids. But then you go and \u201chire\u201d a babysitter with their money without telling them or your friend. They honestly probably deserved the wake up call but it was definitely a petty thing to do. And your friend didn\u2019t deserve being caught in the middle of family drama.", "do you contribute for the house income? do your brother/SIL?\n\nIf not, your parents are within their right to ask of you if you could do perform duties to the well being of the family.\n\nBut that means all of you three. They can not expect to be entitled to your time in favor of your brothers, if the brother and SIL dont do stuff for you too. It is a system of gift/be gifted. You are not their maid and free babysitter.\n\nKinda ESH but also I am with you (?) Stand your ground but also if you are not on you own, youd have to reach a compromise between your parents requirements and your own rights inside the house. \nBut anyway, your brother/SIL are not in anyplace to start making demands.", "ESH. your sibs are the aholes because they dumped their children in you. Youre an ahile for abandoning the kids. Unfortunately once theyre in your care, you gotta take care of em for safety reasons.", "YTA - to a point. It was absolutely not cool of your family to expect you to just babysit. Are your parents expecting you to do this because you live in their house for free? Do you pay rent? If they are doing this because they expect it from you in order to live them rent free then they need to have a conversation with you. Your brother should also have a conversation with you and not just expect you to do this. \n\nI also wonder if you sil is even aware that no one discussed this with you before leaving her kids with you. \n\nI think YTA for just leaving the kids with someone else in this particular situation. Kind of a jerk move to your friend too knowing there is a good chance your brother won\u2019t actually pay her. However I also think you are NTA for not wanting to watch the kids in general.", "YTA for leaving them with someone and not telling their parents", "\"Sophie thanked me for watching her kids and left before I could say anything\"\n\nSeriously?  What, she thanked you then bolted out the door before you could open your mouth to speak? You did put those kids in danger. \n\nNo, I don't think you're an AH for not wanting to watch them.\n\nBut use your fucking words next time and speak up.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
