As a mother to adults, I will never understand why any parent would hold their child back in life from spreading their wings.  Do not feel guilty, do not feel sad, go to WV and learn to be an adult. \n\n Since your parents are not cutting the cord gracefully, listen to me as a mom OP, I am so proud of you.  I know you will do amazing things and build a great life.  Enjoy your freedom, don't do stupid things, make friends that like things you like and have similar values.

I spoke to my mum about it and while she was sad to see me go she said as a parent all you want is your child to be happy and healthy. She also said I should travel while I can and didn\u2019t want to hold me back. Your parents will get over it and if they don\u2019t- sucks but you gotta live your life! Good luck and enjoy your freedom!", "NTA - you have to live your life the way you want (for better or worse). I'm sure it's tough for your family to see you go upcountry, but reassure them you will visit when you can, and that's all you can do. \n\nBest of luck btw, you are doing the right thing in my opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
