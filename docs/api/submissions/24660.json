We've been through our whole lives together, and she is the closest, most important friend in my life. We get along wonderfully, that is - except one weird thing. \n\nFor context, I am taller, and have always been naturally slim, while she is short, was naturally thick and gradually became obese during our twenties. \n\nComing back to the weird thing: she has a habit of forcing food on me when SHE is hungry or wants a snack. For example, when we hang out, she will keep filling my plate even though I tell her that I am full. She will keep opening snacks and than telling me to 'take some' repeatedly. She will fill me a glass of soda when I clearly say I don't want it. But - SHE wants more food, snacks or drinks, so she will take some for her and 'force' some on me as well.  In the past 25 years of friendship I have said nothing of this, and I generally manage to go around it. I don't know why she does this, but I have always thought she feels better if she is not eating alone. Strange habit.\n\nFast forward this weekend, we hung out at her house for a few hours (just the two of us). The whole time she was commenting how 'I am drinking slowly' (one glass of wine in the time period she drank three) and 'not eating anything' (there was only potato chips and similar snacks). In the end, she took out large ice-creams, and while I said I didn't want ice-cream, she opened both and passed one to me. I then said 'girl you don't seem to understand that I physically cannot eat as much as you, thank you but I am really full from my lunch, the glass of wine is enough for me'. She got mad, she said I insulted her, and that she is offering out of politeness.\n\nShe is still passive aggressive towards me. Both her husband and mine think I was harsh on her, and 'throwing my thin body' in her face. That was not my intention at all, and I would never intentionally hurt her. I apologized for hurting her feelings.\n\nAITA? \nHow could I have communicated this better?", "created_utc": 1692050772, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r8q7h/aita_for_telling_my_obese_best_friend_that_i/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are always pushing food at you. There is no way to politely refuse because they refuse to accept your refusal.", "I can see why this remark hurt her feelings.\n\nNTA\n\nForcing food on you like that over your protests is objectionable.  It leaves you either awkwardly not eating with food in front of you, or manipulating you into eating something you don\u2019t want to.\n\nA long period of that assholery is far more significant than one remark that was at worst insensitive.", "NTA\n\nIf she was offering out of politeness, she\u2019d accept your answer when you say no. What she is doing is trying to make herself feel better for over eating. I\u2019m the fat one of my friend group, but I eat the least. They will offer me food and make sly comments about my weight when I decline food. I am fat but I\u2019m also not stuffing my face all day. Sadly, you have to make blunt/direct statements to make them stop. Like eat if you want to eat, it\u2019s not a group sport. It\u2019s been decades. If the kind way of turning her down worked, you wouldn\u2019t have to go the direct route. Eating a lot doesn\u2019t always equate to weight, it equates to you eat a lot regardless of weight.", "NTA. She needs therapy. She needs to understand that the only reason why she is forcing you to eat more it\u2019s probably because she can reduce the guilt that generates her overeating.", "NTA. She is trying to make herself feel better about her own eating choices. If you\u2019re eating too then it\u2019s fine.", "NTA \nYou were kind and even tried to play it off lightly. I don\u2019t know what more you could have done. After you politely declined the ice cream she opened it anyway\u2026. She didn\u2019t give you a choice.", "NTA\n\nWith the way she always ignores your polite no answers on the past, and her actions with questioning why you don\u2019t eat/drink faster and just overruling your opinion on the matter it sounds like she\u2019s the one with issues. \n\nYes she may have gotten hurtful comments about her weight and habits from others in the past,but OP has NEVER said a mean thing towards her,in fact she has in a way been supportive and even though she didn\u2019t want the food has taken it in the end because of her \u201cnagging\u201d and plain just giving it to her without options. \n\nYou tried,you circumvented the issue politely, she chose to ignore it because of her own needs/feelings\n\nYour bf should put himself into this situation,everytime his friend wants food he gets it too,no matter if he is hungry or not, let\u2019s see how he then feels about it,or if he actually says something to the same effect out of DESPERATION like OP just did. \n\nI say let that friend go,if she can\u2019t see her own mistake in this situation then you\u2019d be better off without the headache", "NTA. It seems like she's pushing food on you when she's hungry to feel less guilty about her eating habits. Perhaps the internal logic goes something like, \"If my tall and slender friend is willing to eat, then my hunger for this snack is normal and I'm not overeating.\" I'd encourage you to have empathy because she's probably received a lot of negative messages about her body and her eating habits. That said she needs to deal with her shit and not use you as a crutch for validation.", "NTA, she's got a problem with eating, she doesn't know how to stop, I think she is embarrassed by it, by offering you food she feels less guilty.", "Just don\u2019t eat it.", "NTA\nHear me out... you reacted normally for someone who is dealing with that kind of pressure. \n\nHowever... she's only like this because she has issues with food and possibly already feeling like she eats way too much because shes hungry. I've been there and it can be a result of eating disorders. \n\nWhat you can both do is try to understand each other. You don't want to eat or drink more but you'd likely be fine if she ate and drank what she wanted without pushing you to do the same and she needs to know that. It can make a huge change also if you actually tell her you only know she eats more cause she wants you to eat more but other than that its not an issue for you. Most importantly tell her no one is judging her or cares how much you or anyone eats.", "NTA, force feeding is a form of torture for a reason. She was being selfish, you tried to enforce boundaries nicely and she wouldn\u2019t have if so you had no choice", "NTA. This is actually one of my biggest pet peeves! I absolutely hate when people try to force food on me when I say no the first time. I know if I\u2019m hungry or not, and I know what I\u2019m hungry for and I don\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s help figuring that out!", "NTA\n\nYou held up a mirror that showed her the truth of how unhealthy she was eating. Of course it hurts.\n\nShe clearly has an eating disorder. Keep being friends with her, but don't let her demands for you to eat as much as she does. I hope she realizes that you can support her if she commits to", "NTA . Maybe the way you worded didn't come off very nice , I think you should apologize if you offended her !\n\nI also had a friend like that , although she wasn't obese just a bit overweight. She felt better if we ate the same thing but I didn't have the same appetite nor similar tastes as her. I told her that if she wants to eat what she wants to she's free to do so but I don't always want the same thing. At the end she always compromised so it wasn't a big deal , sometimes she would order a healthier choice just because I did too so that was a plus.\n\nIs your friend clinically obese or is that an exaggeration ? Because if she really is , she must seek professional help for her health. It'll also help with her cravings and eventually end your \"arguments\".", "If \u201cI can\u2019t eat as much as you\u201d hurts your feelings then you got some more demons than just some twinkies and Ice cream cones", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t keep insisting but you also didn\u2019t have to be so rude about it. You said you always managed to get around this issue, meaning you never actually communicated your issue with her.", "NTA\n\nif your friend ignores you when you turn down more food or drinks and then finds it insulting when you tell her you physically cannot keep up with her, your friend is the problem. \n\nshe's insecure about how much she eats and she's taking it out on you because she feels embarrassed over continuing to stuff her face while you don't. everyone is wrong for thinking of it as shoving your thinness in her face and for thinking you were harsh. why isn't anybody acknowledging that she's wrong for ignoring you when you turned down more? people just feel bad because a fat person ended up feeling bad about being fat.", "NTA!!!! \n\nfirst off your friend definitely is because she isnt just offering to be polite, shes FORCING you to eat them by opening everything making you feel obligated to eat it as to not waste food..... second of all, you arent throwing your thin body in her face, if she has insecurities about HER body, thats on her, not you. And last, telling her you physically cant eat as much as her isnt rude at all. my friend and I are the same way, and i can eat THREE TIMES as much as her, doesnt bother me any", "NTA- she needs to realize years of trying to shove food at you is her problem.  It\u2019s not polite to keep harping at you with food until you give in.  She doesn\u2019t want to admit she uses food as entertainment, therefore she\u2019s obese.  she doesn\u2019t know the difference between genuine hunger and a mental drive to eat.", "NTA I am bigger than my wife and cannot eat nearly as much as she does (she's thin and works a very physically demanding job, so she eats a ton of calories and never gains weight). Your friend is just insecure and I totally believe it makes her feel bad about herself to eat alone. That's not an excuse, but I do think that's the reality.", "NTA. Could have puked on her to make her stop forcing you to eat more food, i did this as a kid in my relatives house, they never tried to force me to have too much food after that xD", "NTA - She is forcing food/drinks on to you in an attempt to make her feel better about how much she consumes.", "NTA. You didn't want to eat anymore and she wouldn't take no for an answer. People and their ever present issues around food are not your problem.", "Did you ask your husband how he thinks you could have managed this? After all, he's passing judgement.\n\nYou are NTA. It's very rude to force people to eat. A polite, \"No thank you.\" should suffice. \n\nYou are NTA. And you are a good friend for trying to figure out how to salvage this friendship.", "NTA. \n\nMy mom did this to me. Turns out she was insecure that I was skinnier than her and was purposefully trying to get me to gain weight so she could look better in comparison. \n\nSet boundaries. Her insecurities aren't your problem. This is where a lot of it stems from. She feels shameful that she's eating more than you, and instead of just accepting herself and you as well- she's trying to force you to make her feel better about herself by making you indulge in the habits she's insecure of.\n\nEdit. I made it sound malicious. My mom was doing it maliciously. I can't judge your friend, I don't know her. Keep that in mind when reading the second paragraph.", "You\u2019re NTA. Your friend wants you to validate her eating habits by sharing them.  She\u2019s in denial about her weight and a possible issue with her health.  People don\u2019t like reality messing with their delusions.  It\u2019s upsetting. \n\nYour approach was very kind and you handled things beautifully.  She\u2019s upset with herself, not with you. She may need some profession help to sort things out.", "YTA (but only slightly) - your different appetites wouldn't be an issue if she listened to your boundaries. The message would have been clearer and kinder if you'd said something like \"I've noticed that you tend to encourage me to eat when I've said I'm not hungry. Thank you, but I really do mean it when I say no, I'm not just turning it down to be polite. I don't want to waste food by serving or opening food that I'm too full to eat, so I really need you to hear me when I say 'no thanks'\"", "A little YTA. But you know you could have put it better. First, Apologize. \"I'm sorry. I was rude. I should not have said that. I should have said I wasn't hungry and just left it at that.\" Then stop apologizing.
