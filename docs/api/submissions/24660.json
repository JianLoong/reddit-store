We've been through our whole lives together, and she is the closest, most important friend in my life. We get along wonderfully, that is - except one weird thing. \n\nFor context, I am taller, and have always been naturally slim, while she is short, was naturally thick and gradually became obese during our twenties. \n\nComing back to the weird thing: she has a habit of forcing food on me when SHE is hungry or wants a snack. For example, when we hang out, she will keep filling my plate even though I tell her that I am full. She will keep opening snacks and than telling me to 'take some' repeatedly. She will fill me a glass of soda when I clearly say I don't want it. But - SHE wants more food, snacks or drinks, so she will take some for her and 'force' some on me as well.  In the past 25 years of friendship I have said nothing of this, and I generally manage to go around it. I don't know why she does this, but I have always thought she feels better if she is not eating alone. Strange habit.\n\nFast forward this weekend, we hung out at her house for a few hours (just the two of us). The whole time she was commenting how 'I am drinking slowly' (one glass of wine in the time period she drank three) and 'not eating anything' (there was only potato chips and similar snacks). In the end, she took out large ice-creams, and while I said I didn't want ice-cream, she opened both and passed one to me. I then said 'girl you don't seem to understand that I physically cannot eat as much as you, thank you but I am really full from my lunch, the glass of wine is enough for me'. She got mad, she said I insulted her, and that she is offering out of politeness.\n\nShe is still passive aggressive towards me. Both her husband and mine think I was harsh on her, and 'throwing my thin body' in her face. That was not my intention at all, and I would never intentionally hurt her.

They will offer me food and make sly comments about my weight when I decline food. I am fat but I\u2019m also not stuffing my face all day. Sadly, you have to make blunt/direct statements to make them stop. Like eat if you want to eat, it\u2019s not a group sport. It\u2019s been decades. If the kind way of turning her down worked, you wouldn\u2019t have to go the direct route. Eating a lot doesn\u2019t always equate to weight, it equates to you eat a lot regardless of weight.", "NTA. She needs therapy. She needs to understand that the only reason why she is forcing you to eat more it\u2019s probably because she can reduce the guilt that generates her overeating.", "NTA.

It seems like she's pushing food on you when she's hungry to feel less guilty about her eating habits. Perhaps the internal logic goes something like, \"If my tall and slender friend is willing to eat, then my hunger for this snack is normal and I'm not overeating.\" I'd encourage you to have empathy because she's probably received a lot of negative messages about her body and her eating habits.

I've been there and it can be a result of eating disorders. \n\nWhat you can both do is try to understand each other. You don't want to eat or drink more but you'd likely be fine if she ate and drank what she wanted without pushing you to do the same and she needs to know that. It can make a huge change also if you actually tell her you only know she eats more cause she wants you to eat more but other than that its not an issue for you.

She felt better if we ate the same thing but I didn't have the same appetite nor similar tastes as her. I told her that if she wants to eat what she wants to she's free to do so but I don't always want the same thing. At the end she always compromised so it wasn't a big deal , sometimes she would order a healthier choice just because I did too so that was a plus.\n\nIs your friend clinically obese or is that an exaggeration ?

She feels shameful that she's eating more than you, and instead of just accepting herself and you as well- she's trying to force you to make her feel better about herself by making you indulge in the habits she's insecure of.\n\nEdit.

I take phentermine now, insanely curbs my appetite so much so that I have to remind myself to eat lol. If it gets to where you can\u2019t afford the ozempic, or even get it, definitely ask your doctor to prescribe the phentermine, after insurance I only pay 17 bucks, vs the 1k they wanted for the shots! But I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, was 261 on April 25th, today I am 227, I eat better, go to the gym or workout at home, and can actually play with my 3 year old now. I\u2019m going to reward myself with a new tattoo once I hit my 100 pound loss goal.", "Exactly. I can't believe OPs friend are herself into obesity and is bullying OP into the same thing and now other (presumably also obese) people on the internet are making excuses for her.", "I think it applies to any culture where food is a universal love language. \n\nWhich is most. Not all, but most!", "Pierog is against the law of nature and grandmothers.  Under no circumstances are you allowed to let a pierog exist without traumatizing your grandmother.", "I think if a person can regain control whatever way, things can just get better and better.", "I am Slovak but use the polish dough recipe (sour cream and potato water in it).  Your dough recipe is my favorite.", "Recent fact I learned - fish and fishes are both acceptable plurals. But 'fish' is the plural for lots of the same type of fish and 'fishes' for lots of different types.\n\nI feel like there might be room for both pirogi and pirogies.", "You have your opinion and I have mine. But idk how you can disregard how this person is CLEARLY binge eating and then starving themselves under the name of intermittent fasting because they can\u2019t control the off button", "Yes, but not being able to control the \"off switch\" is a sign of an eating disorder. This person just learned to manage their eating, it doesn't mean that they don't have any disorders though.", "I see this as a false sense of control because what they are doing is basically starving themselves/restricting and binge eating while under the guise of intermittent fasting and weight training which isn\u2019t an uncommon way to \u201cmask\u201d an eating disorder. Let\u2019s just call a spade a spade is what I\u2019m saying", "Only if it's the last pierog on the plate", "Make one REALLY BIG dumpling? I'd eat it", "Generally, taking control is the first step, it\u2019s like telling a depressed person who let their whole house get nasty that they aren\u2019t making progress just because they only cleaned their bedroom. Meanwhile, they cleaned out one room and can look around and go \u201coh, I did it, it might have been very hard for me, but I did it. Wow, it feels a little bit better having a clean room\u201d. In this persons case, it could be that they are trying to cut down slowly with the help of a therapist while also doing all this exercise training they spoke of as a means to naturally cut back on any excess loose skin that might be left over to reduce potential surgical aid needed. Being able to look at a body slowly getting fitter will also help them take the steps towards total control.", "Still taking control and losing weight and feeling good about it. Maybe it\u2019s not always helpful to label overeating as a disorder, as though it needed a more complicated treatment. Sometimes it might do but if you can just find a way out, why make it harder than it needs to be?", "The only way I'm allowing perfectly good pierogi to leave me", "I would cry because I spent all damn weekend making pierogi and this thing dares to steal it. I would have given him some if he asked nicely."]}
