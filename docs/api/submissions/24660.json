We get along wonderfully, that is - except one weird thing. \n\nFor context, I am taller, and have always been naturally slim, while she is short, was naturally thick and gradually became obese during our twenties. \n\nComing back to the weird thing: she has a habit of forcing food on me when SHE is hungry or wants a snack. For example, when we hang out, she will keep filling my plate even though I tell her that I am full. She will keep opening snacks and than telling me to 'take some' repeatedly. She will fill me a glass of soda when I clearly say I don't want it. But - SHE wants more food, snacks or drinks, so she will take some for her and 'force' some on me as well.  In the past 25 years of friendship I have said nothing of this, and I generally manage to go around it. I don't know why she does this, but I have always thought she feels better if she is not eating alone. Strange habit.\n\nFast forward this weekend, we hung out at her house for a few hours (just the two of us). The whole time she was commenting how 'I am drinking slowly' (one glass of wine in the time period she drank three) and 'not eating anything' (there was only potato chips and similar snacks). In the end, she took out large ice-creams, and while I said I didn't want ice-cream, she opened both and passed one to me. I then said 'girl you don't seem to understand that I physically cannot eat as much as you, thank you but I am really full from my lunch, the glass of wine is enough for me'. She got mad, she said I insulted her, and that she is offering out of politeness.\n\nShe is still passive aggressive towards me. Both her husband and mine think I was harsh on her, and 'throwing my thin body' in her face. That was not my intention at all, and I would never intentionally hurt her.

They will offer me food and make sly comments about my weight when I decline food. I am fat but I\u2019m also not stuffing my face all day. Sadly, you have to make blunt/direct statements to make them stop. Like eat if you want to eat, it\u2019s not a group sport. It\u2019s been decades. If the kind way of turning her down worked, you wouldn\u2019t have to go the direct route. Eating a lot doesn\u2019t always equate to weight, it equates to you eat a lot regardless of weight.", "NTA. She needs therapy. She needs to understand that the only reason why she is forcing you to eat more it\u2019s probably because she can reduce the guilt that generates her overeating.", "NTA.

It seems like she's pushing food on you when she's hungry to feel less guilty about her eating habits. Perhaps the internal logic goes something like, \"If my tall and slender friend is willing to eat, then my hunger for this snack is normal and I'm not overeating.\" I'd encourage you to have empathy because she's probably received a lot of negative messages about her body and her eating habits.

I've been there and it can be a result of eating disorders. \n\nWhat you can both do is try to understand each other. You don't want to eat or drink more but you'd likely be fine if she ate and drank what she wanted without pushing you to do the same and she needs to know that. It can make a huge change also if you actually tell her you only know she eats more cause she wants you to eat more but other than that its not an issue for you.

She felt better if we ate the same thing but I didn't have the same appetite nor similar tastes as her. I told her that if she wants to eat what she wants to she's free to do so but I don't always want the same thing. At the end she always compromised so it wasn't a big deal , sometimes she would order a healthier choice just because I did too so that was a plus.\n\nIs your friend clinically obese or is that an exaggeration ?

She feels shameful that she's eating more than you, and instead of just accepting herself and you as well- she's trying to force you to make her feel better about herself by making you indulge in the habits she's insecure of.\n\nEdit.

She didn\u2019t not realize what she said was offensive because to her she was defending herself from a food pusher, her friend took it offensively most likely because of the weight difference and her own embarrassment/envy.
