It's a non-issue.\n\nThing is - even if you wanted to be a step dad, there is no guarentee the kids would accept you.  \n\nIt seems to work for you, your gf, and her kids.  That's all that matters.\n\nThat said, I'm shocked you've made it this far, with her being okay with that.  I've had two situations that sounded similar to yours, and 6 months in they (single mother) started changing the tune wanting something more serious.", "It sounds messed up to me, but if it's working for you both, you do you.\n\nFrom what I see though, I wouldn't be shocked if some guy came along that filled your role AND desired to be a stepfather some day. You could be sent packing. What you have doesn't sound like it would work long term.", "NTA. But you seriously need to consider where you stand with this relationship. Her two sons mean the world to her I am sure and I am sure it would mean the world to her if you showed more interest in being a positive male figure in their lives. If you do not plan to be a step dad I am assuming you don\u2019t want to marry this woman. If you do plan to marry her or be with her for a while I would suggest to try to take more of a role in the boys lives. I would have a sit down with your girlfriend and get her take and her expectations and see how that goes.", "NTA \n\nYou guys have worked this out amongst yourselves what works. From what I hear you have a healthy cordial relationship with the children and a good relationship with the mom. As long as you are a positive in their life I see no harm, you have the right to as little or as much involvement as possible. \n\nOn a side note: tell your friend some women prefer to have a boyfriend who does not act like a father, who doesn\u2019t live with them so she can have the space and time to focus solely on her kids while they are young, please stop speaking for women who didn\u2019t ask!", "NTA. Why would you enter a relationship with someone with kids if you have no interest in her kids? Just curious since it seems like it\u2019s a more complicated/tiring dynamic.", "NTA as long as you and she both understand the arrangement. That said, how serious can you be with a women that you\u2019ll never move in with who has kids that you never want to step parent?", "NTA, if that's truly an arrangement your girlfriend is comfortable with (for both herself and her children)", "NAH but is this relationship really worth it?", "INFO - ages of the kids?   \n\nIf they are real young and you do plan on this being a long term thing... at some point you'd need to commit to being some form of a parental figure. Just the nature of the commitment", "That someone needs to mind their own business. NTA.\n\nSure, an arrangement like this has it's own complicating factors but you and your gf can talk those through without the imput of other people.", "I mean as a woman who doesn\u2019t want kids and will not be a step mother etc to a significant others kids I do get it. And I think you are being cordial and therefore NTA. \n\nThat being said why are you with this woman who has children? Are you both on the same page as far as essentially being FWB? Is that what you both want long term? Has she actually talked about how that might impact her children and how she will deal with that?  I say this because I have done the same with men. And it always turns into \u201c well my child really loves you, and I love you, and you love me so pretty much you are a parent now.\u201d Has she explained to the children in a way they understand where you exist in their lives? If no to ANY of these questions get out of there. Kids don\u2019t understand short term vs long term. Sometimes connections override sanity. And eventually it\u2019ll all come to a head.", "If it works for you all, that's all that matters. No AH here", "ESH.  If you are around the kids but express no interest in them, that is damaging to them.  The fact that neither she nor you respect her kids enough to realize the damage you are doing and break it off is disappointing.  If this was a relationship where you had no contact with the kids that would be another thing.  Now they know their mother will pick a man who dies not care about them at all and will consider him more important than them.  Those kids will also wonder why they are so unloveable that someone who cares for their mother, doesn\u2019t care a bit about them.", "What does your relationship look like long term? If you are pretty serious but never intended on getting married or being a part of the children's lives, how does that look down the road? I caution you. You may not see any attachments to these children, but they will have an attachment to you. You may inadvertently hurt these children as you are a part of their lives. They see that their mother loves you, and you love her? But have zero attachment to them. They deserve to be loved and supported(emotionally) by those who are a constant and large part of their lives. You, of course, are in no way obligated to these children but have chosen to entangle your lives. I wonder what your reasoning is for being in a relationship with a mother, but not thinking a parent is a package deal.", "NTA. This seems fine to me, especially since your partner has not voiced any problems with it. You are not required to be a parent to her kids in order to be her partner. If you were living together it would be a different story, but you aren't. I just don't see how this is doing anything to her kids? She's keeping her romantic life separate from them. That's a valid choice.", "NTA I guess? This situation is uncommon, but if she is genuinely okay with this than the arrangement you currently have is probably the most healthy outcome. That being said if you haven't already you should talk with her and be clear about your boundaries, your future, and plans for how you will interact with the kids/what will happen in emergency situations and make sure she's 100% comfortable with this and not hoping you'll come around to marriage in the future. If you've already had this discussion then I think you're fine. You know the kids and have a healthy relationship the way an uncle or family friend [that doesn't watch the kids] would so I don't think there's a problem. You would be an AH if you married her and became a begrudging stepdad though as that dynamic would be super unhealthy for her children. Personally if I were a single mom I would never want to be in a relationship with a man that didn't want to love my children on their own (though whether a full parental role is taken on is for the children to decide) and as someone who wants kids I would never be with someone who didn't. But if she's cool with balancing this, then that's her call. This is super unusual, yes, but not inherently bad. Just be sure you have plans for all sorts of \"what ifs\" because one emergency could spin this situation into chaos.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I will not date people who have kids, want kids in the future, or are on the fence about kids. A huge part of why is because I grew up with a \"sperm donor\" father situation, and know from experience that it sticks with you as you grow up, and it sucks.  \n\n\n  You and your GF can decide you want a committed, no marriage/living together relationship, but she can't decide for the kids that they have to get involved with a non-committed \"fun\"  parent who will be friends with them someday when they become adults/teenagers i guess?  \nMy question is, do you or your gf know what the kids want?   \n\n\n  Are they old enough to even know what's going on or decide what they want? Do they understand the relationship you have with their mom, or why you've made that choice?    \n\n\nDid you guys think about talking to a professional about this arrangement, like a child psychologist, or maybe a counselor for them?  \n\n\n  Otherwise, what do you guys do to make sure they know that their mom dating someone who is choosing not to be a parental figure is not in any way a negative reflection on them?  \n\n\n  If you haven't thought about that, then YTA.

She also sucks for getting involved with someone who doesn't want kids.", "You're on dangerous grounds here. Like it or not, you are already involving yourself in their lives as a form of parental figure.\n\nThink about it from the kid's perspective: who are you to them? If you don't want to be involved with them, why do you have dinner with them and take them on trips? How are they supposed to view that as they grow up? Are you just some guy who shows up every once in a while to have a meal and fuck their mom? Are you a deadbeat stepdad?\n\nThere are two well-defined paths: 1) You are just their mom's FWB. You don't involve yourself in their lives *at all*, and she comes to your place for whatever. No hassle, they basically forget you even exist. Your relationship with their mom won't get very serious. 2) You get yourself involved as a stepdad. You want to date a mom with kids, so you get a mom - *with kids*. And you can make it however serious you want it to be.\n\nRegardless of what you end up doing*, the children's needs should come first!* I am not convinced the current approach is healthy for them, but perhaps you can prove me wrong.", "NTA,  you made your intentions clear and she is on the same page. How you live your relationship is no one's business but you two. Sounds like you are kind to the kids and do stuff with them at times.  As long as you didn't lead her on under false pretenses (which you didn't) then it's all good. \nHonestly it may be the perfect scenario for her as well. Blending families is hard (I will never do it again) and this way you each have your own place and your own time and the kids get her full attention when with her. Nothing wrong with that. That's what my perfect scenario would be after two failed marriages.", "We're serious (recently) and exclusive from the moment we started dating.\n\nShe's a wonderful girlfriend and I doubt I'll find someone half good as her.\n\nI think living separately (which is my request more than hers) allows for a healthier relationship.\n\nWe won't marry for various reasons including, but not limited to, not wanting to comingle finances and what's the point?\n\nShe's happy with current set-up and not asking for more and I'm also happy and comfortable.", "I mean, let's not assume that she *wants* someone to come along and fill the role of father.", "Then I'll wish her the best and move on.

Do you have a plan if she changes her mind on how things are a week/month/year from now? Women I have known will try and change a guy over time... Is there a break over point for you?\n\nPersonally, I couldn't do that, but I'm coming from a different place in life. I always said that I didn't want kids due to my upbringing. Here I sit 20 years later looking at my two kids in their late teens unable to imagine life without them.", "That could be good. I'm not saying it isn't. They are young boys though, and that is a lot of raising them alone. It wouldn't shock me if she changed her mind  weeks/months/years from now. I wouldn't fault her for it. People need help sometimes, and maybe there comes a day when OP does something that makes her think this guy would be a decent stepfather... He should prepare for that.\n\nEdit 1 - Young boys was referring to OP's girlfriend's kids\n\nEdit 2 - I'm not saying that I could do what OP is doing. I have kids that I love.

Just keep in mind that they may grow an attachment to you in a way you do not feel towards them. Not wanting your own children and being a good role model/adult figure for children are completely separate. You can not want or have children and be an amazing mentor, teacher, or uncle. I just caution you to be empathetic. The children may see you as a father figure. You seem like a decent guy. Keep an open mind and heart. If she is amazing, I'm willing to bet her children are, too. Stay happy, continue to be good, and everything else will find a way.", "I'm honestly of the opinion that you might not want to do more with them as they get older because that will likely lead directly to what this comment outlines.

From my observations, being involved, and  supportive makes kids turn out better. I'm the youngest of a very big family so there are lots of examples to look at - siblings, cousins, etc.. You're being honest with her as to how involved you will be, I can respect that. Honesty and communication is good. The dad in me is saying that the kids will at some point need more though.", "I'd lean more to friend, don't allow them to view you as an uncle figure because that WILL absolutely cause confusion none of you will know how to handle (mommy, if that's our uncle why do you guys sleep in the same bed and kiss??? Cue a very awkward convo)", "Hes intending to be more integrated as they get older.

I don't know that I'd label you the asshole, but just really poor decision making for someone who doesn't want kids.", "YTA for dating someone with kids when you\u2019re childfree. You\u2019re not compatible.", "YTA when you get involved with someone, you get involved with their kids. Like someone else pointed out, this could potentially be damaging to to kids. You should be with someone who is also childfree.", "NTA\n\nWhile not everyone\u2019s idea of a blended family relationship, there\u2019s still nothing wrong with it.\n\nNot every single parent WANTS a secondary/step parent for their kids. I know plenty of people, even those who live together, who keep their spouse very hands off with their children and it works great for them.\n\nAlternatively, I also know a few people who so seamlessly blended families that all 4 adults reside in one large house with all the kids (I think there\u2019s 12 in total). Another \u201cextreme\u201d but something that works wonders for them.\n\nAt the end of the day, the only opinions that matter are yours, your girlfriend\u2019s, and (to your girlfriend) her children.

A child free person shouldn't be dating a single mom.", "NTA for being upfront with her about this. But she is DEFINITELY TA for dating someone who doesn\u2019t fully accept her children. You guys both kinda are.", "NTA it\u2019s super weird that people are criticizing you because this sub is full of people criticizing single parents for moving a new partner in to the house with their kids.", "NTA.

Obviously this comes with the caveat that if one of you is secretly resentful in any way then it\u2019s not sustainable.", "NTA but I wonder what it must feel like to the kids to know that the man their mother loves does not want to play an important part in their lives? That's not a criticism of you, I genuinely wonder if it impacts the children long term.   \nI know I could not have agreed to an arrangement like your gf has agreed to when my kids were little, it just would not have sat right with me.", "Yep. I hope she\u2019s able to meet someone more compatible.", "Agree", "Started casually and now it's serious.

It may be five or seven years but this will end badly.", "Interesting, cause this sub is filled with people criticizing single parents for moving a boyfriend or girlfriend into the house against the kids wishes.", "Why not? She gets a boyfriend, has independency, raises her kids on her own terms without a stepparent's unwanted influence. Perhaps her kids prefer it this way too, they're old enough to not want a stranger as a stepdad. Not every woman dreams of being married. If i were a single mom, op is the kind of guy i'll date. Much better than a guy coming in and yelling at my kids or telling them what to do.", "Incel alert", "She's happy and we discussed this multiple times.", "My boys are 13 and 16, I've been raising them on my own for 10 years now. If I need help, I ask a friend. My ex made parenting so much more difficult that I will never involve a partner again. I have adult time when they visit their father and when they're with me they get my undivided attention.", "Yes and no. Even if you don't mix finances, debt (for both sides) became ONE debt, for example if she takes loans for her kids educations that debt in case of a divorce is cut in half plus if she or he already had, and goes half and half. Even if the other person had nothing to do. Finances isn't income exclusively.", "Not necessarily", "But there's no indication it's against the kids wishes here so not really related.\n\nOf course, different people want all sorts of things in relationships so we can't know for sure what OP's girlfriend wants. However, I assume they find it odd since most people I know want their serious romantic partnerships to move in the eventual direction of cohabitation. Also, most parents want their long term life partner to be a part of their family, not just their SO who dosen't care about their children.", "I wish you good luck.", "I'm sure that it takes a ton of work on your part, and I'd like to sincerely say more power to you! I'm sorry that your ex is that way too. Luckily my ex and I aren't that way. We both just realized that WE didn't work, so the split went relatively well. We both also realized that WE chose to bring them (19/16) into this world, so it  is OUR job to prepare them for it. This is just my situation and it in no way applies to all. Some kids are much better off with only one which sounds like your case. For me, there have been issues from both sides that needed to be worked out, but in the end my workload has been spread. It has made raising them easier.\n\nNow, my ex is a decent person and relatively good mom due to her superior organizational skills, but... In the about 11 years (I honestly can't remember when it became official) there have been some new guys as I call them in my head. She has either had them move in, or vice versa (too soon in her relationship with each). Hell she even married/divorced one... It has caused a fair amount of tension between mostly my ex and my daughter (Because she though it was too soon too). Basically, my ex is the type that can't handle being alone all that well. I'm the opposite. Like you, I'm waiting till they are out on their own before I have anything more than some surface level relationships. There is more about not wanting to get deeply involved before I move too, but that is a couple of years away. So, I do get your point.\n\nMy thing is that OP's girlfriend may be biding her time to see what kind of guy he is before changing her opinion on the matter. Maybe her ex was an ass and doesn't want a guy deep in her life for now. I've seen similar things happen. If all they as a couple want is surface level, good for both of them. It just seemed to me like he should be prepared if that changes. People grow (Edit - Some don't). Desires change. Life happens.\n\n**Edit - I should have been more clear. The tension with my ex and my daughter was because my daughter thought my ex would have the guy move in too soon in my ex's relationship with her new friend. I saw the same thing, but let it be and stayed quiet because it wasn't my household. I was not intending to say that she wasn't allowed to move on.**", "You\u2019re basically ignoring a major aspect of her life which also happen to be two innocent humans. I\u2019m surprised she went for you", "But all that aside, I think as long as you can maintain a healthy boundary between moms boyfriend and this dude is around too much to not be dad then you should be fine. My only advice would be to address this with the children in an age appropriate way, as soon as they start displaying confusion bc eventually they'll wonder why you don't all move in together and THAT would be the prime time to explain this in a kid friendly way.", "NTA\n\nI was all set to call you the asshole but dude you are living in a separate house. You are a boyfriend not a husband. There is no expectation of you husbanding. You are not their stepfather.\n\nJust be Uncle BigButt, a doting family friend and call it a day.", "NTA. Why would an outsider's opinion for a working arrangement between you and your partner matters? You've got yourself an instigator and a nosy one looking to stirring craps.", "NTA. I have a disabled son (relevant in that he will live with me longer than his peer group will tend to live with their parents) and if his dad and I broke up, this is the kind of relationship I\u2019d have. \n\nIt works for you, it works for her, and the kids don\u2019t have to deal with the complexity of a \u201cnew dad\u201d being added into their lives. You guys are fine.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like a mutual agreement, so if it works and your not putting pressure on her to put your alone time above the kids needs, then it's not anyone else business.\n\nIt is different, but it your both happy, good luck to you.", "Yta. Don't date someone with kids if you don't want anything to do with them. It's not fair to kids. You're simply not compatible", "YTA. What\u2019s going to happen if something happens to her? Where are them kids going? Not married so who is going to handle everything. She might be ok with it but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not selfish and short term thinking.  Doctors don\u2019t let boyfriends into the emergency room or let them make medical decisions. I get that she\u2019s ok with it but you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re an asshole for your part in this arrangement and I say yes. You offer this woman no security or commitment. It sounds like a Funtime arrangement until shit hits the fan and then she\u2019s going to find herself on her own. You just coming and going as you please. You taking up space from somebody who would take on the whole package and not just the pieces that are fun. She got low self esteem and should make better decisions but that\u2019s a different conversation.", "NTA, if this works for you and your gf and you are both happy then it's okay.  \n\n\nSometimes I confuse by Reddit, they hate uninvolved or the stepparent that involves too much. And they also hate when something like this also works.   \nWhat kind of help do you think he should offer? Maybe the kids saw him as a fun uncle.", "If everyone actually involved is happy with this arrangement, then carry on.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If this current arrangement is fine and mutually agree upon why change it? Societal expectations shouldn't dictate your relationship.\n\nThis person is making a huge assumption that these kids need and want a step parent.", "NTA, a few people could actually take a lesson on relationships here from your example. You have both communicated clearly on multiple times, how you want this relationship to work. If your both happy, which is the aim of being in a relationship, then what is it of anyone else's place to comment, judge, or tell you your doing it wrong and being an arsehole....", "NTA. I think it's great. Keeping the relationships mostly separate is prob the most healthy thing you both can do.", "ESH except the kids, who will likely be hurt most when this inevitability ends. Their mother is the biggest AH for getting involved with someone who doesn\u2019t want kids.", "NTA but their mother is for constantly dumping them on others whilst she hangs out with you..feel sorry for those kids..very sad situation", "This is a hard one NTA you have never lied but in the other hand YTA your holding a family back from being able to grow in the future. You take the mum away for \"your time\"  at the start not a bad thing. Now after a few years you have to be honest and say your only with her because she accommodates you. If you can't be a family man don't be with a family not because your an arse hole just because you simply want a different life", "NTA  You and your girlfriend have to do what works for you. At the moment this arrangement seems to work for you both. Don't be surprised when down the line she asks for more especially with outside influences talking to her and telling her it's not good for her children. You will never be able to be just their friend. Growing up around you, you will always be seen as an authority parental figure even if they don't voice it as such.", "NTA\n\nThat \"someone\" is the major jerk here. You are not obliged to take on a (step-)fatherly role to your GF's children, and you both, as consenting and reasonable adults, appear to fully understand that. Good on you, you're both acting properly.\n\nFunny (or not so) story - when my ex and I were still together, he made some derogatory comment about men who take on step-children, \"Instant family, just add wallet\". He ended up being the deadbeat who refused to pay anything towards the upbringing of his own child when we eventually split.", "If you both agree to the situation then there is no problem. Had she ever pressured you to move in together or hinted that she hopes things change?", "NTA - you both seem content with your arrangement and it sounds like you get along with her kids well enough, I see no issues here", "NTA, it is a bit of an odd arrangement but as long as everyone involved is okay with it I don't see an issue.", "YTA, let your GF go find the whole package instead of... you.", "Nta\u2026. Personally I respect you I am a single mother and wouldn\u2019t want to \u201creplace\u201d their father with a boyfriend you told your girlfriend how you feel she respects that and accepts it it has nothing to do with anyone else", "Info: if one of the kids had say a medical emergency,  would you help her to the hospital, babysit the other kid? \nIf she had to go to the hospital, can she trust that you will stay with the children for a couple of days?", "This last part for sure. I don't have kids, but I also don't want someone to live with me. I have my own house, my own hours. This arrangement sounds like heaven to me. You get the best of both worlds.", "Exactly this. And if she realizes the damage it\u2019s caused years later she\u2019s gonna resent OP.", "Like how is this damaging to the kids? He treats them well just doesn\u2019t pretend to be their father.\n\nThis sounds like my mum and her partners relationship from when I was a kid and it works just fine. Not every child of a single parent is desperately longing for a nuclear family. Talking from actual experience rather than the hypothetical situations people are making up in this thread I preferred this scenario. I would rather have some guy who is nice to me and my mum but doesn\u2019t pretend to be my dad rather than having to treat some random guy like a member of my family. Me and him hung out, I liked him and missed him when he wasn\u2019t around but had no desire to live with him (which he never did when I lived at home).\n\nWell done OP sounds like you are doing just fine!", "This is so reaching. The kids obviously have family and so does the GF. I have a long term partner, but I have my life set up that my Sister makes decisions for me if I am unable to. The partner doesn't have to be the person that makes the decisions. Also don't assume someone has low self esteem, that's so rude and majorly reaching again.", "Uh oh, I may have to change my answer\u2026\n\n\u2026 your request more than hers? So she wants you to move in?\n\nThis is gonna be a problem.", "I feel like your GF is making all the compromises because she has kids. I find it really difficult to believe your GF is actually happy and not just trying to keep you happy so she won't be alone, sadly GF is already alone but doesn't seem to know it, OP you have GF wrapped around your little finger and it is sad to read.", "As a step kid, I would have rather had this than the marriage, so I hope it works out for you. My stepdad was nice to us, but I enjoyed it more when it was just mom and us kids. This arrangement makes sense to me.", "They might not. But I've spoken to a lot of step kids of good step parents who said, \"I didn't want them at the time, but I'm glad they were patient and loving towards me, and I can't imagine my life without them now.\"", "No just have this random man walking around the house everyday that\u2019s much better.", "To reiterate some other comments here, tread carefully OP. Those kids know you aren't their dad. But they will be seeing a world filled with unconventional families. They will get repeated exposure (from society in general and media) about what roles spouses of parents take. What happens if when they start going through puberty and they have questions? Would you be willing to have conversations with them? If they have an issue they are uncomfortable bringing up to their mom, can they turn to you?\n\nPart time fun parents generally end up causing a lot of damage to kids. It distorts their view of the world. It can hurt their self confidence. Now you are walking a bit of a line here since you aren't a parent. I can't say you will 100% be causing those issues to them. But you do need to keep in mind that these are very real possibilities. You don't have to take an active parenting role. But especially when they still have so many years to grow, you do need to have some sort of thing going on. Some level of mentoring and support. If you are unwilling or incapable of that, yeah you and your gf are very likely setting those kids up for a number of issues.", "I'm a single mother. I'd be more than happy with a long term committed relationship where we didn't live together or mix finances. Sure, they need to be okay having a kid around because we're a package deal. But she has a Dad, doesn't need another one. Plus I've worked too damn hard to buy a house of my own and I want to pass it on to her, without worrying about a partner taking a share.", "Why the hell not? \n\nDo you think all women just go around needing men to marry them and father their children? \n\nWe\u2019re perfectly happy to just have committed boyfriends who listens to us, share similar opinions about having the relationship we both want, and respecting our identities.", "I am a single mum and this is the type of arrangement I would be looking for if I would start a new relationship.\nOP, good job on finding the right equilibrium for both of you, wish you all the best! NTA", "Why?\n\nI\u2019d freaking love to meet a man like that.", ">\u2026 your request more than hers? So she wants you to move in?\n\nThere's the option of \"don't care much either way\".", "Why would you need a plan? All relationships last as long as both people are in agreement about how the relationship should be. If one person changes their mind about a major element, the relationship ends. What\u2019s to plan? It\u2019ll work until it doesn\u2019t, and then it\u2019ll change or die. The same is true for every relationship.", ">I'd be prepared with a plan if the switch get flipped.\n\nYou'd need a plan to...what? Stop calling someone who broke up with you?", "that\u2019s true but in this situation the mother doesn\u2019t want her kids to have a step dad and he doesn\u2019t want to be a step dad", "from the comments he\u2019s really not around the kids often, he\u2019s been out a few times with them but he mostly sees her when the kids are at school", "Yeah but above he seemed to indicate HE is the one who doesn\u2019t want to move in", "I should have been more clear.

I meant that OP should be ready to ask himself the question - Girlfriend changed her mind... Am I going to stick to my plan, or have I become involved to the point that it may be nice to stick around and see where it goes. That's why I asked OP earlier if there was a break over point as in if there was a point where he might be willing if she asked.", ">Maybe plan is the wrong word for this.
