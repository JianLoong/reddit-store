It's a non-issue.\n\nThing is - even if you wanted to be a step dad, there is no guarentee the kids would accept you.  \n\nIt seems to work for you, your gf, and her kids.  That's all that matters.\n\nThat said, I'm shocked you've made it this far, with her being okay with that.  I've had two situations that sounded similar to yours, and 6 months in they (single mother) started changing the tune wanting something more serious.", "It sounds messed up to me, but if it's working for you both, you do you.\n\nFrom what I see though, I wouldn't be shocked if some guy came along that filled your role AND desired to be a stepfather some day. You could be sent packing. What you have doesn't sound like it would work long term.", "NTA. But you seriously need to consider where you stand with this relationship. Her two sons mean the world to her I am sure and I am sure it would mean the world to her if you showed more interest in being a positive male figure in their lives. If you do not plan to be a step dad I am assuming you don\u2019t want to marry this woman. If you do plan to marry her or be with her for a while I would suggest to try to take more of a role in the boys lives. I would have a sit down with your girlfriend and get her take and her expectations and see how that goes.", "NTA \n\nYou guys have worked this out amongst yourselves what works. From what I hear you have a healthy cordial relationship with the children and a good relationship with the mom. As long as you are a positive in their life I see no harm, you have the right to as little or as much involvement as possible. \n\nOn a side note: tell your friend some women prefer to have a boyfriend who does not act like a father, who doesn\u2019t live with them so she can have the space and time to focus solely on her kids while they are young, please stop speaking for women who didn\u2019t ask!", "NTA. Why would you enter a relationship with someone with kids if you have no interest in her kids? Just curious since it seems like it\u2019s a more complicated/tiring dynamic.", "NTA as long as you and she both understand the arrangement. That said, how serious can you be with a women that you\u2019ll never move in with who has kids that you never want to step parent?", "NTA, if that's truly an arrangement your girlfriend is comfortable with (for both herself and her children)", "NAH but is this relationship really worth it?", "INFO - ages of the kids?   \n\nIf they are real young and you do plan on this being a long term thing... at some point you'd need to commit to being some form of a parental figure. Just the nature of the commitment", "That someone needs to mind their own business. NTA.\n\nSure, an arrangement like this has it's own complicating factors but you and your gf can talk those through without the imput of other people.", "I mean as a woman who doesn\u2019t want kids and will not be a step mother etc to a significant others kids I do get it. And I think you are being cordial and therefore NTA. \n\nThat being said why are you with this woman who has children? Are you both on the same page as far as essentially being FWB? Is that what you both want long term? Has she actually talked about how that might impact her children and how she will deal with that?  I say this because I have done the same with men. And it always turns into \u201c well my child really loves you, and I love you, and you love me so pretty much you are a parent now.\u201d Has she explained to the children in a way they understand where you exist in their lives? If no to ANY of these questions get out of there. Kids don\u2019t understand short term vs long term. Sometimes connections override sanity. And eventually it\u2019ll all come to a head.", "If it works for you all, that's all that matters. No AH here", "ESH.  If you are around the kids but express no interest in them, that is damaging to them.  The fact that neither she nor you respect her kids enough to realize the damage you are doing and break it off is disappointing.  If this was a relationship where you had no contact with the kids that would be another thing.  Now they know their mother will pick a man who dies not care about them at all and will consider him more important than them.  Those kids will also wonder why they are so unloveable that someone who cares for their mother, doesn\u2019t care a bit about them.", "What does your relationship look like long term? If you are pretty serious but never intended on getting married or being a part of the children's lives, how does that look down the road? I caution you. You may not see any attachments to these children, but they will have an attachment to you. You may inadvertently hurt these children as you are a part of their lives. They see that their mother loves you, and you love her? But have zero attachment to them. They deserve to be loved and supported(emotionally) by those who are a constant and large part of their lives. You, of course, are in no way obligated to these children but have chosen to entangle your lives. I wonder what your reasoning is for being in a relationship with a mother, but not thinking a parent is a package deal.", "NTA. This seems fine to me, especially since your partner has not voiced any problems with it. You are not required to be a parent to her kids in order to be her partner. If you were living together it would be a different story, but you aren't. I just don't see how this is doing anything to her kids? She's keeping her romantic life separate from them. That's a valid choice.", "NTA I guess? This situation is uncommon, but if she is genuinely okay with this than the arrangement you currently have is probably the most healthy outcome. That being said if you haven't already you should talk with her and be clear about your boundaries, your future, and plans for how you will interact with the kids/what will happen in emergency situations and make sure she's 100% comfortable with this and not hoping you'll come around to marriage in the future. If you've already had this discussion then I think you're fine. You know the kids and have a healthy relationship the way an uncle or family friend [that doesn't watch the kids] would so I don't think there's a problem. You would be an AH if you married her and became a begrudging stepdad though as that dynamic would be super unhealthy for her children. Personally if I were a single mom I would never want to be in a relationship with a man that didn't want to love my children on their own (though whether a full parental role is taken on is for the children to decide) and as someone who wants kids I would never be with someone who didn't. But if she's cool with balancing this, then that's her call. This is super unusual, yes, but not inherently bad. Just be sure you have plans for all sorts of \"what ifs\" because one emergency could spin this situation into chaos.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For good or for ill, grownups' actions and behavior influence kids. They're sponges, they absorb everything. Tread wisely.", "It\u2019s stupid to date someone seriously who has children if you\u2019re not interested in the kids. It\u2019s just going to cause hurt for multiple people in the long run. Find someone who shares your view on children.", "Going against the grain, because unless some information is missing, I think ESH except kids.  \n  I'm childfree by choice, I don't dislike kids, but don't WANT to be a parent, I feel that kids deserve caring parents who want to raise them. So I will not date people who have kids, want kids in the future, or are on the fence about kids. A huge part of why is because I grew up with a \"sperm donor\" father situation, and know from experience that it sticks with you as you grow up, and it sucks.  \n\n\n  You and your GF can decide you want a committed, no marriage/living together relationship, but she can't decide for the kids that they have to get involved with a non-committed \"fun\"  parent who will be friends with them someday when they become adults/teenagers i guess?  \nMy question is, do you or your gf know what the kids want?   \n\n\n  Are they old enough to even know what's going on or decide what they want? Do they understand the relationship you have with their mom, or why you've made that choice?    \n\n\nDid you guys think about talking to a professional about this arrangement, like a child psychologist, or maybe a counselor for them?  \n\n\n  Otherwise, what do you guys do to make sure they know that their mom dating someone who is choosing not to be a parental figure is not in any way a negative reflection on them?  \n\n\n  If you haven't thought about that, then YTA. And so is GF/ the mom.", "ESH. Don't like kids? Don't get involved with someone who has them. She also sucks for getting involved with someone who doesn't want kids.", "You're on dangerous grounds here. Like it or not, you are already involving yourself in their lives as a form of parental figure.\n\nThink about it from the kid's perspective: who are you to them? If you don't want to be involved with them, why do you have dinner with them and take them on trips? How are they supposed to view that as they grow up? Are you just some guy who shows up every once in a while to have a meal and fuck their mom? Are you a deadbeat stepdad?\n\nThere are two well-defined paths: 1) You are just their mom's FWB. You don't involve yourself in their lives *at all*, and she comes to your place for whatever. No hassle, they basically forget you even exist. Your relationship with their mom won't get very serious. 2) You get yourself involved as a stepdad. You want to date a mom with kids, so you get a mom - *with kids*. And you can make it however serious you want it to be.\n\nRegardless of what you end up doing*, the children's needs should come first!* I am not convinced the current approach is healthy for them, but perhaps you can prove me wrong.", "NTA,  you made your intentions clear and she is on the same page. How you live your relationship is no one's business but you two. Sounds like you are kind to the kids and do stuff with them at times.  As long as you didn't lead her on under false pretenses (which you didn't) then it's all good. \nHonestly it may be the perfect scenario for her as well. Blending families is hard (I will never do it again) and this way you each have your own place and your own time and the kids get her full attention when with her. Nothing wrong with that. That's what my perfect scenario would be after two failed marriages.", "We're serious (recently) and exclusive from the moment we started dating.\n\nShe's a wonderful girlfriend and I doubt I'll find someone half good as her.\n\nI think living separately (which is my request more than hers) allows for a healthier relationship.\n\nWe won't marry for various reasons including, but not limited to, not wanting to comingle finances and what's the point?\n\nShe's happy with current set-up and not asking for more and I'm also happy and comfortable.", "I mean, let's not assume that she *wants* someone to come along and fill the role of father.", "Then I'll wish her the best and move on. I can't ask her to stay with me if she finds a better situation for her kids.", "Personally, I prefer to keep my children out of my relationships. The only way they'll get a stepparent from me is if I decide to get married after they've moved out. OP's gf could feel the same.", "We will not marry as well for various reasons including not wanting to comingle finances.", "I agree many people like to make assumptions on behalf of other people.", "contrary to what y\u2019all may believe most people aren\u2019t looking for a partner to fill a role for their kids. it\u2019s perfectly normal to date as a parent and not expect your partner to step into a father role for your kids", "Pretty serious otherwise. I'm happy with current set-up. We're super compatible and we do majority of things together.

Serious and committed without marriage or living together.

When we started it was more casual and it became more serious with time. Nonetheless my feelings regarding having children didn't change.\n\nI'm unfortunately not capable of showing any fake affection if I don't have it. But as I mentioned I like the kids and show them affection by taking them hiking, rock climbing, occasional trips... Etc when they get older we'll continue to do more stuff.", "i think this is an amazing choice actually, if more parents did this their relationships would probably last longer with their partners and with their kids.", "What if what?\n\nIf she has some sort of emergency of course I'll be there for her.\n\nYou mean death? She has a sister and two parents alive who would have custody of the children.", "You are correct. The kids dad may have been a real ass, and so she is rightfully not wanting a guy in that role... For now. Maybe she is just enjoying the moment and all that goes with it. Good for her. I'd be prepared with a plan if the switch get flipped.", "If you can do that, then it is part of you doing you in this situation. Go for it. Do you have a plan if she changes her mind on how things are a week/month/year from now? Women I have known will try and change a guy over time... Is there a break over point for you?\n\nPersonally, I couldn't do that, but I'm coming from a different place in life. I always said that I didn't want kids due to my upbringing. Here I sit 20 years later looking at my two kids in their late teens unable to imagine life without them.", "That could be good. I'm not saying it isn't. They are young boys though, and that is a lot of raising them alone. It wouldn't shock me if she changed her mind  weeks/months/years from now. I wouldn't fault her for it. People need help sometimes, and maybe there comes a day when OP does something that makes her think this guy would be a decent stepfather... He should prepare for that.", "Married people don't have to mix finances", "If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re gonna have to man up and take care of these kids. It\u2019s definitely a package deal", "Yeah.. they are quite young. Tough to be with their mom without being involved more than some dude who is around. Nature of dating someone with kids.  Good luck figuring this all out!", "I read more of your responses. To each his own. If you can make it work, go for it.", "When does she see her children if she's spending so much time with you?", "Hey you do what works for you guys.", "You posted here asking for feedback. You got it. It's not always going to agree with you.", "As long as you are good to them, that's all that really matters. Just keep in mind that they may grow an attachment to you in a way you do not feel towards them. Not wanting your own children and being a good role model/adult figure for children are completely separate. You can not want or have children and be an amazing mentor, teacher, or uncle. I just caution you to be empathetic. The children may see you as a father figure. You seem like a decent guy. Keep an open mind and heart. If she is amazing, I'm willing to bet her children are, too. Stay happy, continue to be good, and everything else will find a way.", "I'm honestly of the opinion that you might not want to do more with them as they get older because that will likely lead directly to what this comment outlines. I think what my question is, is how you and your girlfriend, intend to handle the confusion that is likely coming one day when you tell them you want their mom for the end of time or however long, but not them.", "Glad your kids are decent humans and you love them. Having kids is a gamble and I'd rather be a lonely elderly than a miserable anxiety ridden, over my kids, elderly.\n\nMy breaking point will be more involvement or living together or asking to get married ... Etc which she's fine with and won't ask for more.", "Unfortunately not happening and I'd rather break up than getting more involved.", "We travel once or twice a month for few days each time. Rest of the month she's with her kids. She does stuff with me when they're in school, either outside or she comes to my house. Or when I go to her house.", "Don\u2019t pop their bubble. It\u2019s so perfect kids totally don\u2019t matter or take time and that time won\u2019t change as they grow.", "Thank you I agree!", "Eventually they'll grow and have their own lives. I'll be a friend/ uncle type I guess.", "most people don\u2019t count someone as a father because they took them out a few times", "Yup, it's a crap shoot. From my observations, being involved, and  supportive makes kids turn out better. I'm the youngest of a very big family so there are lots of examples to look at - siblings, cousins, etc.. You're being honest with her as to how involved you will be, I can respect that. Honesty and communication is good. The dad in me is saying that the kids will at some point need more though.", "I'd lean more to friend, don't allow them to view you as an uncle figure because that WILL absolutely cause confusion none of you will know how to handle (mommy, if that's our uncle why do you guys sleep in the same bed and kiss??? Cue a very awkward convo)", "Hes intending to be more integrated as they get older. They might not now, but if he continues, they will.", "y\u2019all do realize plenty people raise amazing children without having a dad involved ?", "True", "Yes I do. Parenting is a lot of work though and there may come a day when he does something that makes her think spreading the load is a good idea."]}
