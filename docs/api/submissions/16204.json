We go back a long way and I have always been aware of her poor relationship with her family. When Serenity was 6 and her sister was 2 their dad passed away from sudden heart failure. Serenity's mom remarried within a year of their dad's passing. Her stepfather is John. He and Serenity's sister became father and daughter instantly and he adopted her sister when she was 5. Serenity didn't feel ready for John and he went out of his way to take away memories of her dad in the house, and to insert himself into Father's Day and other holidays as \"dad\" and anything less resulted in a sit down talk with her mom and John about John being the one who was raising her and how he deserved her love and respect for that. Lots of kids in school knew how Serenity felt about John. I remember when we were 11 and there was a community Father's Day fun day and how John had taken Serenity, her sister and the two kids he and Serenity's mom had together and that John kept holding Serenity by the arm and whispering to her because she didn't want to be there and was clearly not having a good time. He then yelled at a friend of Serenity's who brought up Serenity's dad and John being her stepdad.\n\nWhen Serenity and I started dating she told me John was nothing but the asshole who took down all photos of her dad and replaced them with photos of him. That he even took frames that had the title of dad on them and took out her dad's photo for his. This even included some photo frames in her own room. She also talked about how they had changed her last name to make up for the fact John was denied the chance to adopt Serenity when he adopted her sister.\n\nWhen Serenity and I moved in together she and I had talked about getting engaged and she told me she didn't know if I wanted to be old school but she'd like for me not to ask her stepfather for his blessing to marry me. I told her I wouldn't have dreamed of asking him and when we were ready to get engaged I would plan something special. This is exactly how it went down.\n\nAfter we announced our engagement social media blew up because she didn't tell her family (she is very low contact with them). Her mom was all like why didn't he (meaning me) let us know what he was planning. Then John showed up, and mind you we live 5 hours apart, at our house and asked me what the hell was I thinking proposing to *his daughter* and not seeking his blessing first. I told him that he does not own Serenity and she is perfectly capable of deciding whether she wants to marry me herself. He said it's the tradition of it all. I told him that the tradition was to ask the brides father and since Serenity's dad died when she was a kid, it was impossible to do that. I shut the door in his face then and he left. Serenity was so upset that he called and apologized that I had to go through that. Now we are both getting harassed through social media because they said I was rude to him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683022450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135gvtn/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9es_stepfather_he_doesnt/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

May you and Serenity have a long happy marriage =)  \n\n\nSecondly, NTA! You were perfectly within your right to tell him to fudge off from your property and since SErenity doesn't consider him a parent then there was no reason to ask his imput.

Your fianc\u00e9e didn't want you to ask him for his blessing so you did the right thing. Honestly I'd block anyone who is harassing you", "Nta, you mention that you know the role he sees himself in her life, but that's inconsequential, as that is a role that he forced upon her, I'm sure causing her trauma. He should have respected her feelings and treated her like a daughter expecting nothing back, and if he was lucky, she may have considered him a father later on when the relationship was naturally built. Instead, he enforced that relationship on her, and now that she is a adult she has every right and ability to cut that relationship off", "NTA driving 5 hours is unhinged. You respected your fiance wishes and that's the only thing that matters. But maybe go through the socials and start blocking people because I'm assuming he's not walking her down the aisle. So you got round 2 coming your way.", "NTA, she told you what she wanted and you complied. That\u2019s all that matters. It sounds like her mother doesn\u2019t stand up for her not then and not now.

Congrats on yours and Serenity\u2019s engagement!!  I know exactly how Serenity feels because I had a similar experience with my family.  What helped me to finally move on and leave my immediate family was that I did everything possible in my power to resolve issues with my parents.  Only then when I realized that I tried everything to resolve ongoing issues but nothing changed, I chose to walk away from this toxic relationship.  It\u2019s been 32 years since I had contact with my parents and I have no regrets.  My parents actually crashed our wedding and it was upsetting at first but I realized that this was my and my husband\u2019s big day and focused on our happiness.  It was hard but I can honestly say that I don\u2019t remember our interaction because of all the support we received from his family side and our friends.\n\nYou can\u2019t control the behavior/actions of others but you can control how you react towards others\u2018 behavior/actions.  Hope this helps.  Again congrats!! \ud83e\udd17", "SMH on the audacity of people.  So very much NTA.  \n\nThe child in me wants you to respond to every negative social media post with \u201ceat a bag of di*ks, \u2764\ufe0f Serenity and (you)\u201d.  And screenshot everything.", "NTA, but her family are.", "NTA.  Blessings to a long and happy marriage.  If you two decide to have boy child, I hope you give him the child Serenity\u2019s dad name as the child\u2019s middle name,", "NTA, at least now you know who NOT to invite.", "NTA. You\u2019re both adults making an independent decision to get married (congrats!). Parents aren\u2019t entitled to a heads-up, let alone being asked for a blessing.", "NTA Honestly get a restraining order and block them. \n\nObviously don\u2019t invite any of these people to the wedding.\n\nI wish you and Serenity happiness", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 asked you not to ask him for permission. You honored the woman you are going to marry. The most important thing is standing by her and supporting her. Unless she\u2019s in the wrong obviously. But in this case she had a simple and responsible request. Her SD is going to be really mad when he realizes that he\u2019s not going to have any of the traditional FotB duties and you both need to prepare for the fight and harassment that will come with it. Stand your ground now. It\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better.", "This is ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA - its a super cringy tradition TBH. Like what if he says no? Your not gonna marry her if you love her?", "Congratulations!\n\nAnd NTA. That tradition is stupid, and old fashioned.

He has no right to decide or distribute any type of control over her or whatever weird ideas he has. Very strange. \n\nCongratulations on the engagement! This dude is skating on the edge of not being invited to the wedding.", "NTA and it sounds like the two of you will be very happy... just make sure to discuss all wedding plans with the vendors and venues in case any relatives try to flex.", "NTA. Congrats. Thank you for respecting her wishes and thank you for standing up to a shitty tradition. \n\nIf I may just add something - social media is something you can curate: there is no need to be taking shit from people on it and think you\u2019re too mean. You can delete things, block people, limit comments and even not post things for peace of mind. Take no shit.", "When my wife and I were talking about getting married she made it clear if I asked her dad for permission *she* would say no. And their relationship isn't even as fraught as the one you've described here. All her family is doing is proving why going LC was a good decision. There's only 2 people whose opinions actually matter when it comes to your relationship and it's yours and Serenity's.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA and the only way you could\u2019ve responded better is agreeing you should have spoken with her dad first and then asking for a ouija board so you can apologize.", "NTA and she even explicitly asked you not to ask John for his blessing to marry her, respecting her demand is obviously way more important than her wannabedad stepfather\u2019s misogynistic tradition.", "Where do you live that a father thinks he owns his daughter? Wtf is that weird tradition . Absolutely NTA", "NTA - Sounds like low contact is about to become no contact. He is a major AH for forcing himself into her life and trying to destroy the memory of her father. Good on your for letting him know exactly who is he to her.", "Agreed that it is a stupid, antiquated tradition. I didn\u2019t ask my wife\u2019s dad\u2019s permission or blessing to marry her. My daughter is really young, but if/when the time comes, and her partner asks for my permission or blessing, I plan on telling that person that the only person\u2019s blessing they need is hers.", "Generally speaking yeah.\n\nBut there are scenarios where it\u2019s important to the fianc\u00e9es, in that case imo it\u2019s important. \n\nBut yeah OP NTA!", "After this she is 100% on not inviting them. She was already considering it and is now sure that she doesn't want to.", "Serenity already changed her last name back when she turned 18. So that will be the name used!", "I\u2019d go even further if you are comfortable with it and change your last name to her father\u2019s surname \ud83d\ude07", "He has not been in the habit of brooking disappointment!", "She told me not to do it. She doesn't think John was deserving of being asked.", "I feel like there's an opportunity to rework the tradition. Like, suppose one got the potential parents-in-law together to say something like, \"I intend to propose to your daughter, Millicent, but I know how important family is to her, and I would never want to be the cause of any conflict between you and her. So I'm giving you this heads up. If you have any reservations about a potential union, now is the time to raise them, before I've made the proposal.\"\n\nI can easily see that there are certain parents who one might not want to extend that courtesy to, but if one is otherwise on good terms with a partner's parents and one knows that they're a bit old-fashioned, I'm sure that there's a way to meet their expectations of tradition with a more modern sensibility.\n\nHaving said that, I wouldn't have given the stepdad in this story any consideration.", "That seems like a wise idea and I would be going above and beyond to make sure they never find out.", "Make sure you have security who knows not to allow them in and make sure any family on her side know that feeding the parents info and/or trying to undermine her decision will be disinvited.", "I hope that you are able to enjoy your wedding. I also hope that they do not find out when and where so they do not try and ruin the day, because him driving 5 hours shows he is not stable and would most likely do something like that.", "I would go one further and invite mom plus guest. And on the wedding program I would list her father and mom and leave Step Dad off completely. He doesn\u2019t walk her down the aisle either.\n\nMake sure he knows beforehand and if he has an issue with it. Mom simply doesn\u2019t get a plus one.", "That's basically what my husband did. He just said that he was planning on proposing, we'd talked about it, and that he wanted their blessing before making it official (very specifically, blessing /= permission). He also talked to both my mom and dad, together. I'm also close to my parents, and like some of the traditions and such with weddings (white dress and asking for blessing yes. Garter toss, no). So it made sense, but it wasn't \"oh, if you say no, I won't do it\" so much as \"hey heads up, and I'd really like it if you're happy for us too\"."]}
