Serenity's mom remarried within a year of their dad's passing. Her stepfather is John. He and Serenity's sister became father and daughter instantly and he adopted her sister when she was 5. Serenity didn't feel ready for John and he went out of his way to take away memories of her dad in the house, and to insert himself into Father's Day and other holidays as \"dad\" and anything less resulted in a sit down talk with her mom and John about John being the one who was raising her and how he deserved her love and respect for that. Lots of kids in school knew how Serenity felt about John. I remember when we were 11 and there was a community Father's Day fun day and how John had taken Serenity, her sister and the two kids he and Serenity's mom had together and that John kept holding Serenity by the arm and whispering to her because she didn't want to be there and was clearly not having a good time. He then yelled at a friend of Serenity's who brought up Serenity's dad and John being her stepdad.\n\nWhen Serenity and I started dating she told me John was nothing but the asshole who took down all photos of her dad and replaced them with photos of him. That he even took frames that had the title of dad on them and took out her dad's photo for his. This even included some photo frames in her own room. She also talked about how they had changed her last name to make up for the fact John was denied the chance to adopt Serenity when he adopted her sister.\n\nWhen Serenity and I moved in together she and I had talked about getting engaged and she told me she didn't know if I wanted to be old school but she'd like for me not to ask her stepfather for his blessing to marry me. I told her I wouldn't have dreamed of asking him and when we were ready to get engaged I would plan something special. This is exactly how it went down.\n\nAfter we announced our engagement social media blew up because she didn't tell her family (she is very low contact with them). Her mom was all like why didn't he (meaning me) let us know what he was planning. Then John showed up, and mind you we live 5 hours apart, at our house and asked me what the hell was I thinking proposing to *his daughter* and not seeking his blessing first. I told him that he does not own Serenity and she is perfectly capable of deciding whether she wants to marry me herself. He said it's the tradition of it all. I told him that the tradition was to ask the brides father and since Serenity's dad died when she was a kid, it was impossible to do that. I shut the door in his face then and he left. Serenity was so upset that he called and apologized that I had to go through that. Now we are both getting harassed through social media because they said I was rude to him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683022450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135gvtn/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9es_stepfather_he_doesnt/", "score": 590, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Congrats on yours and Serenity\u2019s engagement!!  I know exactly how Serenity feels because I had a similar experience with my family.  What helped me to finally move on and leave my immediate family was that I did everything possible in my power to resolve issues with my parents.  Only then when I realized that I tried everything to resolve ongoing issues but nothing changed, I chose to walk away from this toxic relationship.  It\u2019s been 32 years since I had contact with my parents and I have no regrets.  My parents actually crashed our wedding and it was upsetting at first but I realized that this was my and my husband\u2019s big day and focused on our happiness.  It was hard but I can honestly say that I don\u2019t remember our interaction because of all the support we received from his family side and our friends.\n\nYou can\u2019t control the behavior/actions of others but you can control how you react towards others\u2018 behavior/actions.

I wanted my husband to ask, not because he needed permission, but because I knew my parents would appreciate the respect.", "My husband \"proposed to me\" in bed when I was excitedly showing him a cat video on my phone and he just says \"I love you, I want to marry you\" and I'm like \"same.\" \nFive minutes later I'm like \"AND WE COULD DO IT MEDIEVAL THEMED WITH VEGAN FINGER FOOD AND A HUGE FIREPLACE, CANDLELIGHT DINNER IN THE WOODS\" \nAnd he was just \"... excuse me what\" \n\"HIRE A HORSE FOR THE PARTY AND ASK GRANDMA TO SEW SOME VELVET green CAPES FOR THE PARTY AND MY SISTER CAN DRESS AS GANDALF AND DO THE CEREMONY. WHERE CAN I BUY HIDROMEL? ANYWAY GREEN. MIDDLE OF WINTER SO WE DONT COOK ON THOSE CAPES. JUNE. AND THERES NO RAIN IN JUNE SO YEP. JUNE. BUT THAT CRASHES WITH JUNE FESTIVITIES SO WE MIGHT HAVE A -SAO JOAO- THEMED SIDE TABLE, RIGHT?\" \nhim \"... Sure\"\n\nHe is marrying into crazy. He's aware and wishes to proceed. (Southern hemisphere and no snow, so winter is prime party season for woods cause you get no mosquitoes). But I proposed as well. And plan on keep doing it. We already are legally married and already exchanged rings (I bought them on AliExpress) but I want -the party-, dress in grey as a warrior bride and walk down the aisle in a tunnel of swords carrying a cat companion and asking my dad to pretend to not let me go and pretend to fight so everyone is \ud83d\udc40 in panic. There are 5 dramas already written for this marriage, a fake death and a joust. \n\nPs: my sister won't have to keep the Gandalf costume in the party, it's only for the ceremony. She gets to be a glam elf like everybody else.", "I love this. lol", "Saving this comment for all the whackos on this sub that say you can't call women \"females\" anymore lmao", "NTA - I hope she has family that still has pictures of her father so she can have them up at your wedding.\n\nCongratulations on your big day.", "Good! Try to keep the details of the wedding remain private, and choose a venue that has security you can give his picture to (or hire your own).", "You should both take her bio father\u2019s last name when you get married (or combine yours and her fathers)", "Lol I've already addressed what the SD did wrong - I doubt that highly; the info OP provided is the probs the worst of it otherwise he would of said - she resents SD because her bio father is dead, SD is trying his best to be a father to her since she was five and still havent won her over; which says alot - his methodology may be wrong but bar what i said he did wrong, he's coming from a good place.", "Don't get me wrong, he has not business forcing himself they way he did, if a child doesn't want a stepfather/stepmother to try to be family then they should stop. My point was from the point of view of someone who married a single parent, help raise the child and get not recognition at all. I myself grow up with  stepparent from both side, I didn't like them that much and it took me to have my child to know how stressful and how much responsibility a parent have, now put into the mix the kids are not tour and doesn't like that much, now I love them and do whatever it takes to help them.", "I had an ex who insisted if we got married he \"had\" to get my dad's permission. I told him if he did that my dad would automatically say that you don't know my daughter well enough to marry her and it was be a no from me as well. He got pretty angry about it. Turned out to be a massive red flag about his controlling/abusive nature.", "This is what I did. I didn\u2019t really ask permission to marry my wife; I basically asked if they would accept me into their family as their son-in-law. It went over really well and we\u2019re all close 10 years later.", "I feel like it\u2019 a time honoured tradition for a bride or groom\u2019s parents not to care for the person their child would like to marry and to withhold their blessing. Most of those marriages have still taken place. Why break tradition now only to prevent a marriage from happening when both parties are willing? NTA, OP.", "I said the same thing about walking down the aisle with someone. I would never let anyone \"give me away\" because I'm not a parcel. I would let them walk with me as sign of solidarity and familial approval of the union.", "i think the modern reworking is you call your parents before announcing it to others. that's also an earned privilege op's future in-laws did not earn. \n\ni'm super close to my in-laws they're awesome as hell. i did not ask permission or give a heads up because it seemed absurd. and they did not care at all as they live in the 21st century", "That is awesome!  My kind of people for sure! I'd love to see all of that.  So fun!!", "Married 25 years!", "People  id themselves as F or M here, next to their age,  but you can't say the whole word?  haha", "It sounds like her mother doesn\u2019t stand up for her not then and not now.

Why can't I call myself what I want, especially since I was trying to make it clear that a woman did the proposing to a man, for context.  Am I allowed to say woman?  I know you can't say girl, or is that not a thing people hate any longer?", "Now we are both getting harassed through social media because they said I was rude to him.\n\nThe block button is your friend.", "Wouldn't know lol, I'm just as confused as you are.
