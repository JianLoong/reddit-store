Serenity's mom remarried within a year of their dad's passing. Her stepfather is John. He and Serenity's sister became father and daughter instantly and he adopted her sister when she was 5. Serenity didn't feel ready for John and he went out of his way to take away memories of her dad in the house, and to insert himself into Father's Day and other holidays as \"dad\" and anything less resulted in a sit down talk with her mom and John about John being the one who was raising her and how he deserved her love and respect for that. Lots of kids in school knew how Serenity felt about John. I remember when we were 11 and there was a community Father's Day fun day and how John had taken Serenity, her sister and the two kids he and Serenity's mom had together and that John kept holding Serenity by the arm and whispering to her because she didn't want to be there and was clearly not having a good time. He then yelled at a friend of Serenity's who brought up Serenity's dad and John being her stepdad.\n\nWhen Serenity and I started dating she told me John was nothing but the asshole who took down all photos of her dad and replaced them with photos of him. That he even took frames that had the title of dad on them and took out her dad's photo for his. This even included some photo frames in her own room. She also talked about how they had changed her last name to make up for the fact John was denied the chance to adopt Serenity when he adopted her sister.\n\nWhen Serenity and I moved in together she and I had talked about getting engaged and she told me she didn't know if I wanted to be old school but she'd like for me not to ask her stepfather for his blessing to marry me. I told her I wouldn't have dreamed of asking him and when we were ready to get engaged I would plan something special. This is exactly how it went down.\n\nAfter we announced our engagement social media blew up because she didn't tell her family (she is very low contact with them). Her mom was all like why didn't he (meaning me) let us know what he was planning. Then John showed up, and mind you we live 5 hours apart, at our house and asked me what the hell was I thinking proposing to *his daughter* and not seeking his blessing first. I told him that he does not own Serenity and she is perfectly capable of deciding whether she wants to marry me herself. He said it's the tradition of it all. I told him that the tradition was to ask the brides father and since Serenity's dad died when she was a kid, it was impossible to do that. I shut the door in his face then and he left. Serenity was so upset that he called and apologized that I had to go through that. Now we are both getting harassed through social media because they said I was rude to him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683022450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135gvtn/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9es_stepfather_he_doesnt/", "score": 1138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Congrats on yours and Serenity\u2019s engagement!!  I know exactly how Serenity feels because I had a similar experience with my family.  What helped me to finally move on and leave my immediate family was that I did everything possible in my power to resolve issues with my parents.  Only then when I realized that I tried everything to resolve ongoing issues but nothing changed, I chose to walk away from this toxic relationship.  It\u2019s been 32 years since I had contact with my parents and I have no regrets.  My parents actually crashed our wedding and it was upsetting at first but I realized that this was my and my husband\u2019s big day and focused on our happiness.  It was hard but I can honestly say that I don\u2019t remember our interaction because of all the support we received from his family side and our friends.\n\nYou can\u2019t control the behavior/actions of others but you can control how you react towards others\u2018 behavior/actions.
