For context I\u2019m 40F. We have the same dad (63) but different moms. There is obviously a considerable age gap between us but I\u2019ve always had what I feel is a decent bond with her and also my stepmom (59F) even when I went off to college.\n\nKaylee is the only child of my stepmom and grew up without me in the house so she was spoilt to an extent which my dad and stepmom have both admitted to and it has caused Kaylee to develop an attitude regarding her professional life. Basically, Kaylee has gone through a string of jobs and has almost always quit due to a disagreement with a coworker or a slight criticism or just not getting on with someone. She has struggled especially the last year trying to find something suitable since she graduated from college as she has a number of jobs which she only stuck out for sometimes only a couple of months.\n\nSince I\u2019m 40 and have had a lengthy career she asked me for my opinion and advice on what to do and she wanted honesty. I told her as best as I could without sounding like a bitch that the attitude she has is not doing her any favours. I said that in every job, you\u2019re gonna have criticisms and disagreements and that it\u2019s part of your professional growth and that you can\u2019t just quit something anytime someone might not agree with you. Especially in highly professional environments which she wants to get into, it is normal to have debates etc. and you\u2019re going to clash with coworkers but you most of the time deal with it and come to a compromise. I told her she needs to be realistic and that she can\u2019t expect to progress anywhere if she can\u2019t stick out a job because she can\u2019t take any form of criticism etc. because sometimes you mess up in a job and that not every criticism is an attack against her and that from an employer perspective; it doesn\u2019t look good to have multiple jobs in a short term period on a resume. I recommended she try and better regulate her emotions and try to understand that it\u2019s healthy to have some criticism and general disagreement and that if she can seriously learn to control that and not let it affect her, it would do wonders for her for the rest of her life.\n\nI thought I handled it well because I did it calmly, honestly and objectively and tried to help her. She even thanked me at the time but now she has taken it really badly? She has took it to mean I was telling her she isn\u2019t going to get anywhere in life and that\u2019s not the case at all. She\u2019s dragged our dad into it and he\u2019s saying that Kaylee is just very sensitive and I could have perhaps been a bit \u2018softer\u2019 with my advice. My stepmom actually thinks I said nothing bad and that my dad has always pampered Kaylee more than she ever did and that I gave sound advice and it was \u2018the kick up the ass Kaylee needed.\u2019 \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694342121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ex08b/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_needs_to_be/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
