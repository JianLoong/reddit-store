Now, my daughter told all of her friends that she had epilepsy because when she was first diagnosed, since her seizures could be triggered by strobe lights in movies and video games.

If the game or movie had anything remotely like a strobe effect, most of the friends would opt for a different one.

This \u201cfriend\u201d would constantly call her back in when there was a strobe sequence. ( saying \u201cthis is the best part, it\u2019s ok to watch\u201d) Long story short, I had to step in and say no to anything with strobe effects. The reason I\u2019m telling this is because that \u201cfriend\u201d was someone she grew up with and had been around since before she was diagnosed. One of her 2 best friends. I ended up having to restrict their friendship because if it. Kids are mean. My daughter is 26 now and even some of my family didn\u2019t really take it too seriously earlier in her life until they actually saw her having a seizure. Basically, as a parent, there were a hundred reasons you could have come up with to get the movie switched. Honestly, I would have a talk with the parents about it and see if there\u2019s a way to have the kid talk to your son with all of you. If this child is still trying to do all the things his friends do without letting them know that he has restrictions, he will end up seizing at your house one day. Maybe the parents don\u2019t know that he\u2019s keeping it a secret from ALL of his friends. I had talks with all the parents of anyone my daughter would hang out with, that was my responsibility as a parent of a child with epilepsy if I wanted her to have a more normal life.

She had a large brain tumor removed last year, radiation to that part of her brain, and another brain surgery this year.

For example, we went to see the latest Spiderverse movie--she LOVES Spiderverse--and I had to drive her home 45 minutes from the end because she couldn't process all the visuals. Experiences like that aren't just physically dangerous for her; they're embarrassing and frustrating because she just wants to have \"normal\" teenage experiences.\n\nIf she went to an adult and asked for help and was refused it, I'd be livid.  Strobing happens out of the blue; you can't predict WHEN it happens. Do you always know when a strobe light's going to start?

And you \\*refuse to help a kid who could literally have a seizure--\\*and basically set him up to blame him should one be triggered.

Theres a ton of ways OP could have handled this, I wasnt in the mood to list them all out.", "Please give some of those 1001 excuses for making them change movies to a completely different genre mid-movie.", "OP should head to an advice sub if they wanted to know exactly what they should have done.", "Feel like I'll be soon lynched for thinking that would solve nothing in reality. \n\nI think in the end OP was put in an impossible position regarding the boys' relationship, What he could've and should've done, was prevent Matt from watching further if that was a known safety hazard.", "It\u2019s not just the movies either. There are going to be a lot of times they\u2019ll want to do something he can\u2019t and he can\u2019t run to an adult each time. At best they\u2019ll just ice him out and stop inviting him or hanging out with him at worst they\u2019ll call out his \u201ccrybaby\u201d behavior and that comes with the mocking and being picked on.", "I think you're under the impression teenagers are *very* stupid.\n\nThey're not.", "You\u2019re kidding, right? The kid who didn\u2019t want to watch the movie goes to the kitchen and then the parent comes in and says they have to change it? These are teenagers, not toddlers.", "This is true but if they do have those warnings we\u2019re right back to the same issues. I really feel for the kid but now that he\u2019s a teenager he has to learn to navigate this without adults because his peers won\u2019t put up with it, not if they just think he\u2019s being a crybaby when he doesn\u2019t get his way.", "Do you think the dad should disclose the medical condition against the kids will? Use your brain here, the kid said no so how can he make this a teachable moment and parent them on epilepsy without doing so?", "Maybe I get to be in charge of kids because I\u2019m smart enough to understand the entire situation here and you think they\u2019re toddlers or that dad should force another teenager to disclose his medical history after he\u2019s already said no", "He suggested that. The kid was adamant he didn\u2019t want him to know. You can\u2019t force a person to tell their medical history. I agree the kid should have told the friend but he wouldn\u2019t do that so his options are extremely limited. Nobody is forcing almost adult teens to switch movies and include a kid after they \u201ctattle\u201d this was never going to go well", "You're reading comprehension is terrible dude", "Did you read the post? Matt went to OP specifically bc they *didn't* know about his epilepsy, and he desperately didn't *want* them to know.", "He would have to make up a lie to make the others watch a movie they didn\u2019t want to watch.", "He should only reveal the condition with the kid's permission, absolutely. But he also could have offered to drive the kid home if he didn't want to reveal that--suggesting he just \"close his eyes\" is a remarkable insensitivity to the kid's condition.", "Yeah, I'm surprised everyone here thinks it would be so easy for OP to just unilaterally switch the movie on a bunch of teens. For starters, aside from the event being hosted at OP's house, this really has nothing to do with OP at all. It was the boys who planned things-OP needlessly getting involved is going to cause unnecessary issues with his son. And they would totally know that Matt had something to do with the movie being switched. It would definitely make me rethink inviting him to future events if I thought he was someone who complained to parents to get his way when he didn't get what he wanted. Bc that's the conclusion the group would moat likely come to without knowing Matt has epilepsy. \n\nI can understand all the ppl upset that OP didn't really treat Matt's medical condition with an appropriate level of seriousness, but for me that's the only area where OP dropped the ball.", "You don\u2019t know that. If his son was told instead of OP being expected to make up a lie to ruin everyone else\u2019s evening there\u2019s a good chance he would be fine putting on something else.", "She probably thinks a seizure is just shakiness", "Have you ever been a teenager?? If you're hanging out with friends watching a movie, the last thing you'd want to agree to is a movie change by your patent", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I don't want you to watch this film in my house\"\n\nIt may not seem rational, they'll probably complain, you'll look like the villain. But they're teenagers, you're a parent. They're predipsoed to seeing you that way anyway.\n\nThe kid will be covered and the movie will change.", "Well, if you want to judge him to but, can't think of what should he has done instead than, maybe he is not an Asshole after all?", "Exactly! It\u2019s like nobody here has ever met a teen. These kids are beyond adult interference at this point unless it\u2019s a critical situation. Social situations can no longer be handled by adults without serious repercussions, like the kid being iced out and ostracized. They\u2019re not at the age where you can force them to play with the neighbor kid who doesn\u2019t have any friends and hope for the best", "He could have pulled aside his son, explained the situation, and asked his son to suggest something else. Assuming his son is the paragon of goodness he claims, it wouldn't be a problem.", "Your grammar is terrible dude", "hence why I deemed OP an AH , for letting the kid watch the movie knowing it was a health hazard for him. That was pretty irresponsible.", "But his hands were also tied for all the reasons listed above. He didn\u2019t have a whole lot of great options here. He presented what he had and the kid rejected them all.", "I have.\n\nMy friends and I regularly watched old teen movies from the 80s.\n\nWhat I am saying is he could have **tried,** but being dismissive was absolutely not the only or best solution.", "You don't think it would be suspicious at all that OP was okay with their movie choices (especially if they've watched them at home before) and then suddenly changed his mind? \n\nDo you maybe have a more believable excuse OP could use?", "\u201cThe movie you said we could watch? The one you know I\u2019ve watched 100 times before?\u201d\n\nBecause that\u2019s going to go over great and not completely embarrass OP\u2019s son.\n\nThe chances of them putting the movie back on after OP leaves the room are much higher than the chances of that actually working.", "That\u2019s still disclosing another person\u2019s medical history not only without consent but explicitly against their consent.", "No. Expecting a teenager to advocate for another teenager and make up lies to his friends isn\u2019t ok.", "You're**", "Hey son, maybe let your new friend pick the first movie and watch your movie second? Didn\u2019t have to reveal anything.", "You are grammar is terrible dude? I think they got it right the first time", "A 50 point plan lol. Literally all he is asking is what you tell the son\u2026 because that seems to be a critical point of your whole alternative plan?", "Youree*", "All you had to say was \"one of your friends told me something in confidence, and I think the best way to solve it is to change up the order or selection of the films.  Sorry, bud.  Yeah, you have to.  You don't need to know why.  If you have a problem with it I can send your friends home.\"", "I think it\u2019s easy enough to tell the son that Matt isn\u2019t comfortable with a horror movie. Lots of people don\u2019t like horror\u2026 op is an AH", "Came to say exactly this. I had a similar situation arise with my kid's friend a few years ago. They were 14. My kid didn't like having to switch their plans, but also wasn't a jerk about it. When I told him there were reasons I wasn't giving him details, reasons to do with someone else's privacy, he respected that. And they didn't cut out the kid in question either--I don't know if that had come up in the friend group, but I made sure to organize a hangout for them at our house which included that kid. Older kids are still kids and need that kind of guidance sometimes.", "All of these suggestions on how to make the son change the movie without revealing the info are probably solid. \n\nThen again I don't think it would do Matt much good, if OP came and put it like this I believe there would be like 90% they would never invite Matt again. \n\nI still think the best course of action would be for him either tell them about his restrictions or to just Opt out if he does not consider them friends and does not trust even one of them.  I gave OP YTA in my own comment to be clear. I think it was highly irresponsible to let the kid back to the movie knowing his condition.", "So now Matt gets bullied for \"being a pu**y\" (before the righteous brigade downvotes, remember that this is a group of teen boys here) instead? That's a great plan.\n\nThe ADULT thing to have done is to back Matt up and say that it's ok to tell them why they need to switch the movie. Let Matt know that you have his back and you'll make sure the movie gets switched and that if Josh ever tries to pull any bullshit to intentionally try to trigger a seizure \"for the lulz\" (at any time, in any place) that he will be punished for being an immature AH.\n\nOP is YTA.", "If Matt is worried about being made fun of for having epilepsy, saying he\u2019s too scared to watch a horror movie isn\u2019t the best alternative", "Matt could've told them that himself, it's not cool to make others lie in your place. Also, could you imagine how would a bunch of teen boys react if one of them supposedly made their parent switch the movie instead of telling them because he's afraid of the horror? I think he would be teased like there's no tomorrow, not so much for the fear of horrors, but for running to OP for that. - must realize they would not know the real reason here... \n\njust imagine a bunch of 16yo boys thinking Matt just ran to the kitchen to say \"Hey Mr OP, please make Josh and the rest watch something else, I am afraid to watch a horror movie\" ...\n\nHonestly, I don't believe OP should intervene in the relationship between the boys. He should've made sure Matt does not go back to watch the movie tho. He could've asked him to help with the hot dogs for example and stay with him for the duration of the movie. \n\n I think Matt should either trust his friends won't endanger him on purpose or decline their invitation next time unless knowing the activities were safe for him. OP nor his wife can't always be there to jump in and re-arrange to meet his needs without explanation, that's not sustainable in the future anwyays."]}
