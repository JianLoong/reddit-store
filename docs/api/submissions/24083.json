I said why not just tell them, and he said he was very afraid that once they knew, they were going to try to trigger him on purpose \u201cfor the lols.\u201d Now I know my son like the back of my hand, he would never do anything like that. I tried to reassure Matt of this but he just shook his head and basically begged me to switch just one movie so he could watch it with them and then he'd leave early (his logic being that if they didn't listen to him about it, they'd defer to my authority).\n\nI thought about it, but had to say no because I doubted my son and his friends would agree to just switch the movie without a good reason being provided. I suggested to Matt that if he really didn't feel safe telling them to just close his eyes if he suspected a strobe / flash scene was coming up, and that if he still didn't feel safe he could just go home.\n\nI guess Matt decided it wasn't that big of a deal after all because he went back in there and didn't complain. But when my wife got home and I told her about how the day went, she was appalled that I didn't switch the movie or confront our son about how they were treating Matt. I told her it was no big deal and that the day went fine, the guys are old enough to handle conflicts on their own. She disagreed and won't back down on this issue.

When they test for photosensitive epilepsy, the strobe is significant and right in front of your eyes. When watching a movie the strobe is usually much more dim and further from your face, so closing your eyes usually (not always) works well.", "If Matt wants to tell them that he doesn\u2019t want to have watch the movies because he has an issue with gore, then that would be on him to tell the other guys. It would still be really weird for OP to make them change movies on the insistence that Matt doesn\u2019t like gore. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t solve the problem, it just obfuscates the real reason for the problem", "Oh that\u2019s right. Reply to the only N.T.A comment on here. Not the thousands of others that are calling you out for not understanding epilepsy. Your wife is 100% right here. You dropped the ball. What would you have done if the poor kid did get triggered? You know it would have been your fault, right? The moment he disclosed to you, it became your responsibility because your the adult. So if he had a seizure, it would be 100% your fault. \n\nYTA", "Being flexible and kind - horrible idea,  just horrible.", "If you are being sarcastic (and im pretty sure you are) you might consider adding a '/s' on the comment.\n\nI am often amazed at the astonishing reactions obviously sarcastic posts can get without that.", "by revealing the personal information of a kid to a person said kid explicitly said they don't want to reveal their personal information to?", "Bruh I have 3 teenage kids, their friends hang at my house often, I have a lot of experience with teenagers. I promise you\u2026.they will figure it out. They\u2019re not dumb. But also even if that did work what about next time? What about when the fair comes to town and they want to go as a group? Is he going to go to adults and make them all change plans? This isn\u2019t sustainable. He needs to either trust them which I know is hard or he\u2019s going to have to excuse himself when they do things that could be dangerous for him.", "freaking snowflakes .. here's your safe space.\n\n/s", "I didnt say OP had to reveal the epilepsy - i think pulling their son aside would have been the easiest way to make this a non-issue, thats all.", "Not my safe space.

I am sorry, this is not an attack honestly, I am just trying to imagine what you have in mind.\n\nI am trying to fit your advice int the scenario laid by OP.\n\nSo his teen son and friends have this movie night periodically. Supposedly they tend to watch this genre (well-expected of teens I would say) .\n\nSo once they bring this new kid, and the kid says he doesn't want to watch this genre but doesn't really elaborate as to why other than he would prefer. He's outvoted by the teens who want to watch the superhero thing. The movie is set up and starts. Still normal from the POV of the kids right?\n\nNow the new kid disappears to the kitchen where the parent is. The parent comes back with the kid and pulls their son away. They tell the son \" I can't tell you why, but you have to switch the movie.\"\n\nThe normal teen reaction would be either scoff or scoff-free \"why would I do that, we agreed already with my friends o this movie\"\n\n....then what? I can't seem to get over this part in your suggestion, could you elaborate pls?", "I kid, I kid. Thanks.
