I said why not just tell them, and he said he was very afraid that once they knew, they were going to try to trigger him on purpose \u201cfor the lols.\u201d Now I know my son like the back of my hand, he would never do anything like that. I tried to reassure Matt of this but he just shook his head and basically begged me to switch just one movie so he could watch it with them and then he'd leave early (his logic being that if they didn't listen to him about it, they'd defer to my authority).\n\nI thought about it, but had to say no because I doubted my son and his friends would agree to just switch the movie without a good reason being provided. I suggested to Matt that if he really didn't feel safe telling them to just close his eyes if he suspected a strobe / flash scene was coming up, and that if he still didn't feel safe he could just go home.\n\nI guess Matt decided it wasn't that big of a deal after all because he went back in there and didn't complain. But when my wife got home and I told her about how the day went, she was appalled that I didn't switch the movie or confront our son about how they were treating Matt. I told her it was no big deal and that the day went fine, the guys are old enough to handle conflicts on their own. She disagreed and won't back down on this issue.

Now, my daughter told all of her friends that she had epilepsy because when she was first diagnosed, since her seizures could be triggered by strobe lights in movies and video games. Any time my daughter had friends over they would either watch movies or play video games. If the game or movie had anything remotely like a strobe effect, most of the friends would opt for a different one.

This \u201cfriend\u201d would constantly call her back in when there was a strobe sequence. ( saying \u201cthis is the best part, it\u2019s ok to watch\u201d) Long story short, I had to step in and say no to anything with strobe effects. The reason I\u2019m telling this is because that \u201cfriend\u201d was someone she grew up with and had been around since before she was diagnosed. One of her 2 best friends. I ended up having to restrict their friendship because if it. Kids are mean. My daughter is 26 now and even some of my family didn\u2019t really take it too seriously earlier in her life until they actually saw her having a seizure. Basically, as a parent, there were a hundred reasons you could have come up with to get the movie switched. Honestly, I would have a talk with the parents about it and see if there\u2019s a way to have the kid talk to your son with all of you. If this child is still trying to do all the things his friends do without letting them know that he has restrictions, he will end up seizing at your house one day. Maybe the parents don\u2019t know that he\u2019s keeping it a secret from ALL of his friends. I had talks with all the parents of anyone my daughter would hang out with, that was my responsibility as a parent of a child with epilepsy if I wanted her to have a more normal life.

I'm guessing that your angel of a son and his friends have bullied other kids because why else would Matt have that fear? You should have definitely insisted that they change the movie to something else and then let Matt excuse himself, maybe come up with something like his parents had an emergency or anything.\n\nAs for Matt and epilepsy were you going to sit there and coach Matt on when to close his eyes?

The only lesson he learned is you are not a safe person for him. \n\nIf you knew your son wouldn\u2019t tease Matt it wouldn\u2019t have been that hard to pull your son aside, explain the situation in private and had him advocate for a movie chance as well.", "YTA\n\nWhen a child, even a teenager, is in your house their safety is your responsibility.

What was even your job if your response was to just do nothing?", "YTA. A bit of context: my daughter has similar triggering issues. She had a large brain tumor removed last year, radiation to that part of her brain, and another brain surgery this year. Any visuals that require a high intake of visual information--jumpcuts, strobing, etc--triggers dizziness and crippling headaches. For example, we went to see the latest Spiderverse movie--she LOVES Spiderverse--and I had to drive her home 45 minutes from the end because she couldn't process all the visuals. Experiences like that aren't just physically dangerous for her; they're embarrassing and frustrating because she just wants to have \"normal\" teenage experiences.\n\nIf she went to an adult and asked for help and was refused it, I'd be livid.  Strobing happens out of the blue; you can't predict WHEN it happens. Do you always know when a strobe light's going to start? Do you know before the director decides to do a series of rapid-fire jumpcuts?\n\nHere's a teenager who feels embarrassed by the fact that he can't have a \"normal\" experience like other kids. Rather than risk getting made fun of (and it's likely he's experienced it before), he goes to you, the adult in the house, to suggest watching something else. And you \\*refuse to help a kid who could literally have a seizure--\\*and basically set him up to blame him should one be triggered. Next time, pull your child aside and explain the situation, so he can suggest watching something different. That way it comes from the kids and feels less like an adult making demands.", "What would you have done if your son and friends came running, saying there\u2019s something going on with Matt, and you see him seizing on the floor?", "I nay be biased because my partner has epilepsy but you're a major AH!

But you are an adult. \n\nThis aside, if the kid went in, absolutely fearful of judgement then had a seizure, what would you have done? The other kids would likely be traumatized. If your kid found out you knew, but did nothing about it, he would probably resent you a bit. I only mention those first because your relationship seems to matter more than the fact that this child had a life threatening condition. \n\nWhat would happen if he told you, his parents found out, he died from complications and you basically said \"tell them or suck it up and just close your eyes and guess when you'll get triggered\". Have fun in court. \n\nAnd a last little point, I would like you to do a little experiment. Go get a flashlight. Go in a relatively darker space so that when you look at it, it is noticable. Now close your eyes and flash it in front of them. Do you see light still? Closing your eyes doesn't stop epilepsy. \n\nNext time ask the actual question:\n\nAITA for not suggesting a different movie when I knew it could cause seizures in one of the kids? \n\nIn case you missed it, yea. YTA\n\nEdited to add: technology is a wonderful thing. If the boys were gonna watch multiple movies, you could have slowed the movie down. Epilepsy occurs from many things, but for flashing lights there is usually a threshold of how many per second that can occur. If the teenager knew his threshold, a simple google search to get an idea if the movie was safe and if it can be slowed would be an actual compromise. Things like this occur when you have compassion for kids. You could have googled solutions, suggestions, anything. Instead, you knew you didnt know anything about epilepsy and told the kid to suck it up or get lost. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. You refused to accommodate a disability.
