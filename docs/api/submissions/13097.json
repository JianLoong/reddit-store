This was also my mother's birthday. Literally 2 days afterwards. \n\nHe'd googled the price of her assets and looked at the will (not because he was asked to but he wanted to see what he was getting) and \"done the maths\"\nAfter pointing out how disgusting his behaviour was I excused myself and left as I don't have time for that. \n\nFast forward to a group chat created by another brother to try and smooth things out before the funeral. This did not go as planned for that brother. Within 10 minutes I'd been told I need to to get both sides of the story but it's ok because I'm getting married so I can say as I please.\n\nI'm a very black and white kind of person, I say things how I see them and if I offend someone, well then be offended. At no point had I provoked him yet me getting married clearly was a cheap shot from him and that didn't sit right with me. So I told him where to stick it and while he's there to throw my wedding invite out.\n\nNow fast forward again to the day of the funeral. Family members are telling me to clear the air. How our grandmother wouldn't want this.  Normal guilt tripping stuff. \n\nAt no point had he made an effort to even attempt to justify his sh*tty behaviour but here at the funeral I'm the bad guy for uninviting him? Both of my grandparents would be turning in their graves if they could see how he is acting. \n\nSo AITA for uninviting him? Most of my family think I am\n\nEdit: Out of all my brother's (5 in total) we have the least communication between all of us. His behaviour over the years has never been great (committed fraud with other family members ID and that's barely the start) but the moment our grandmother passed he was all of her things. The cheap shot about how I can say as I please as I'm getting married made no sense but it was the final straw for me.\n\nSorry for not including backstory earlier not posted much on Reddit before but am happy to answer any questions", "created_utc": 1679682693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120tddw/aita_for_uninviting_my_brother_to_my_wedding_over/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you saying your brother said that you feel like you\u2019re getting married so you can do what you want? \n\nI think ESH, unless I\u2019ve missed something.", "ESH. \nBeing a black and white person doesn\u2019t mean you have to be a jerk and offend everybody. You\u2019re creating drama for no reason.", "NTA - you are not obligated to invite anyone to your wedding and if your bro is already not close and is pissing you off\u2026 go for it. \n\nAlso I can not imagine that kind of disrespect to your MOM. She just lost her mother. That\u2019s a different kind of hurt. Yeah he\u2019s saying the quiet part out loud that many people are usually all over the inheritance when someone passes. Especially those who are in desperate money situations. But this is one of those times that its quiet for a reason. Just because he isn\u2019t grieving doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t be kind and respectful to those who are. \n\nAlso your family\u2019s reaction wreaks of \u201cboys will be boys\u201d energy but idk your gender to say for sure.", "ESH.\n\nYour brother's behavior was disgusting. But escalating immediately to uninviting someone from your wedding is a relationship-ending move and seems excessive unless there is far more history with your brother than you are telling us.", "NTA. Your brothers behaviour was gross. Just straight up calling him out on it was fine.\n\nUltimately, it's your wedding. If you don't want him there, then that's your right. Will it damage if not destroy your relationship with him? Yup, but his behaviour right after your grandmother's death also damaged the relationship.", "[info] What is his side of the story?\n\nI think you should link this to your WhatsApp group chat so both your brothers can give their views. There's clearly something else which your brother feels is important to say, which you appear to have neglected to tell us.", "NTA. That's a huge disrespect to your lovely grandmother. You did well. He was after money and such greedy people are dangerous.", "ESH", "NTA. Your brother'e behahaviour was rather inappropriate. The fact that he took a cheap shot at your getting married shows he was harbouring some sort of resentment or jealously over it and it so happened to come forth over the grandma disagreement.", "My condolences on the death of your grandmother. \n\nHe apparently views your grandmother like a bank account, and his behavior is disgusting.  Vultures tend to come out when the death of a loved one happens.. Your brother's behavior is horrible, and shame on the family for not seeing it for what it is.\n\nNTA", "Let me put it this way.\n\nYou are **NTA.**\n\nIt's frankly disgusting behavior to lose the matriarch of your family and have your eyes immediately fixate on the value of a payout.  Now, with that said, I also think you should clear the air with your brother unless you plan on going no contact for the remainder of your life.  \n\nI'm speaking from experience here.  The last thing you want on your wedding day is the gray cloud of a tumultuous family relationship floating around.  Also if you are planning on having any relationship in the future, you'll regret that he wasn't there.  \n\nNow for the future.  Your brother is extremely concerned with inheritances.  You now know this about him and should prepare for the inevitable future with your own parents.  Make sure your parents know that after witnessing his actions upon your grandmother's death, you want their last will and testament to be explicit with its' beneficiaries in order to avoid any arguments.  If everything isn't written out, I get the feeling your brother will be looking for any excuse to increase his portion of your parents' assets.  Which is grotesque, but it's my situation as well.  My brother's already plotting for my parent's houses and assets, meanwhile he's so unreliable that I'm the sole trustee.  See if you can do the same.", "Poor grandma", "Let's take your upcoming wedding out of the story. For all practical purposes, that's not the issue here.\n\nWhat's important is:  a) Your grandmother hasn't even been gone, buried & mourned yet, and her will hasn't been officially read. b) it's only been 2 DAYS!! and brother is already googling how much her assets are worth?! c) brother has a history of fraud & identity theft on other family members. \n\nYou are correct, his behavior is disgusting. He's going for a money grab & wants everyone else to just \"fall in line\" because \"It's Faammily!\". Throwing your wedding at you was simply an easy way to distract everyone away from his actions. \n\nLeave him as \"uninvited\" to your wedding & hire a lawyer to look into this for you.\n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nYour brother sucks because his behavior was inappropriate, but you suck for escalating to uninviting him to your wedding, which can easily end any relationship.", "NTA\n\nThe funeral didn't even happened and he was already building sand castles with \"his inheritance\". It's rude, greedy and selfish. The grandparents would have changed their wills if they could. At least now you can see how he thinks of the people he claims to love.\n\nETA: He's not even in the will, your mother is. So 2 days after the death, on your mother's birthday, in her presence, your brother thinks he is within his rights to talk about \"his inheritance\".", "NAH. \n\nY'all have different grief processing times. Maybe he was uncouth with his delivery, but those inheritance facts will ultimately matter quite a bit. (And most people really need the extra income).\n\nPlus, you just said you have no problem offending people, so why should he tip toe around you? \n\nBut, I assure you he's not upset over skipping your boring wedding.", "You say you called his behavior disgusting, but somehow think you didn't provoke him in the least.\n\nYou're TA, and so's your brother.", "People are weird when dealing with loss - he was left braining it (possible way to deal with loss) and you were emotionally reactive\u2026you get to do what you want, but I think being stubborn and rigid in response to someone\u2019s grief response is an asshole move.", "It\u2019s your wedding do as you please. Anyone who makes not about you and how see your day is being selfish. I know people think they deserve say in others weddings. Weddings are unions. Them sharing the moment with you isn\u2019t a requirement.", "ESH\n\nSo he didn't behave like you thought he should.  So what. He could have been more subtle.  He wasn't.  I'm not sure why you're all in this drama or why you uninvited him. You both are acting like children. Grow up.", "ESH", "YTA for uninviting your brother to your wedding over inheritance issues that arose after your grandmother's death. While your brother's behavior may have been insensitive, uninviting him to your wedding seems like an extreme reaction. It's understandable that you were upset with him, but your wedding day is not the time or place to hash out family grievances. Your family members are right that your grandmother would not want this kind of drama at her funeral or at your wedding. It's important to try to clear the air and move forward, rather than holding onto grudges and causing further rifts in the family.", "I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your grandmother. I don\u2019t understand exactly what happened. To me it reads Brother jumped the gun and somehow obtained the will and determined what everyone would get and then told them all about it without being asked. Brother was told it was inappropriate timing but he didn\u2019t care. This was brought up on a family group text and others were saying there are two sides to a story and then said something along the lines of any overreaction by you can be attributed to getting married implying you may not be rational right now? That\u2019s what I read at least. But then you said the \u2018I say things as I see them and if it offends someone that\u2019s their problem\u2019 or something like that. Which throws you into AH category for that viewpoint alone. You are saying I have an opinion and I have a right to air that opinion without concern of how it may be received whether or not that person even asked for the opinion. That\u2019s AH. \nIf my reading is correct you couldn\u2019t handle someone else\u2019s opinion that you might not be thinking clearly during the stress of a wedding and were offended so you uninvited them and are asking if you are the AH for how you responded to someone whose opinion offended you.
