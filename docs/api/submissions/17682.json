My wife's younger sister, Ann (36F), currently lives in Florida with her GF and 2 kids (15 & 10).  The 15-year old is gay.  Ann's GF obviously isn't the father to her kids.  Ann came out as bisexual about 5 years ago and divorced the kids' father.  I don't know a lot of details about her divorce, but I do know that she was granted primary custody of her kids after a long and tumultuous custody battle.  \n\nLast weekend, my wife came to me and said she needed to talk.  Apparently, Ann's landlord has either refused to renew the lease for the house they rent, or they increased the rent to price Ann out of it, my wife wasn't sure.  As a result, they have to be out of their house June 1st.  Due to recent political events in Florida, Ann wants to move her family out of state.  \n\nMy family lives in a Midwest state that has a much more LGBTQ+ friendly political atmosphere.  Ann told my wife that she and her GF agree that moving their family to our state would be a good move for them.  But given the short timeline for their housing situation, they are up against the clock.  So, Ann asked my wife if they could stay with us while they find a place for them to live.  \n\nI told my wife I have a lot of reservations about that idea.  We only have 1 extra bedroom, so sleeping arrangements would be difficult and would probably involve moving kids into rooms together.  Also, I currently WFH and my office space is located in that extra bedroom, so my work situation would be directly impacted.  I don't have a physical office to go to for work.  Also, the housing market in our area is pretty tough right now.  Houses are going for above market price and selling fast.  The rental market isn't any better.  All of that leads me to believe that if Ann and her family come stay with us, it won't be short-term.  And the people most directly impacted by this will be me and our kids, not my wife.    \n\nI explained all of this to my wife and told her I don't think it's a good idea.  I told her I feel bad for the situation Ann and her family is in, but she's asking a lot of our family and I don't feel like we are in the proper position to take them in.  \n\nMy wife did not like my response one bit.  She accused me of not caring about her sister and that we took my brother and his family in short-term before.  Which is true, but a vastly different situation.  My brother was having some renovations done on his home and we were given a concrete timeframe for their stay.  The work permit on their renovation had an end-date that work needed to be completed by, so we knew exactly how long they would be staying.  They ended up staying a week less than they expected.  And at that time our 2 youngest were still sharing a room anyway so we had 2 extra bedrooms and I wasn't working from home. She sees this as me playing favorites with my family versus hers and thinks I am being an AH.", "created_utc": 1684528614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m711o/aita_for_not_letting_my_inlaws_move_in_with_us/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re clear in your reasoning. It wouldn\u2019t be a practical move for the people who already live there.", "NTA\n\nThe situations are different. \n\nWhat you describe will probably put a big strain on your marriage. And they can rent elsewhere. \n\nIf you do agree to it, make sure it's for a clearly defined short term time and then they move out, regardless.", "Is there any reason your sister and her partner can't stay a long term Airbnb or short term rental? Is it a financial hardship?", "NTA.  Once they're in and don't find accommodations in a timely manner,  you will be stuck with them indefinitely. This would be detrimental to your marriage.  And your work.", "Info: do Ann and her GF have jobs that are remote, or have they secured employment where they\u2019re moving to? \n\nWhile I understand your wife thinking you\u2019re playing favorites, the two situations (your bro and her sis) are quite different. You also had more room when your bro needed temporary accommodation. You and your wife need to know A LOT more about her sister\u2019s situation before you open your home to them. \n\nRight now, NAH. I totally see your side, and I totally see your wife\u2019s side.", "NTA. You articulated clear and cogent reasons for declining to allow them to stay with you. You\u2019ve also differentiated between this situation and the situation with your brother in a few huge ways: finality of timeline, lack of space, work circumstances. \n\nI understand your wife wants to help her sister, but this just doesn\u2019t feel like a reasonable ask to me. You\u2019re right that yourself and your kids will be most impacted by this, and also that if the housing market is bad, their \u201ctemporary\u201d stay could become indefinite.", "NAH - I don't think they were at all wrong to ask considering the circumstances (though, I do have questions like... do they have jobs lined up? And if not, how are they going to buy a house? And if custody was a battle, are they even going to get cleared to leave the state with the kids??).\n\nI think the situation with your brother *was* different; it's going to be way more cramped and way longer term. No one in the house is going to enjoy this. Like how many showers for how many people is it going to be?\n\nThat said, I can see why your wife would be hurt by this because she's not thinking about logistics here; she's just thinking with her heart and wanting to shelter her family from a bad situation.\n\nI would try to come up with some other ideas/options to help them out.", "NTA. However, so she can\u2019t accuse you of playing favorites, create a concrete contract. Explain it to your wife that your brother had a specific reason and a specific end date due to the contacts he signed for his own home that would get him back out of your house by a specific date. If her sister is to move in then you want that same guarantee. A specific end date. Tell her you also need a solution to your office problem before they move in. If that be a man shed or whatever but that your work can\u2019t be impacted on such a critical level and that it hadn\u2019t been when your brother was there bc you were still in office. Yes the kids would have to share for a bit but here again, make the concrete rules. Your kids are having to share to allow her kids to be there, which means the space that is for them is for them and not the cousins. Tell her that if she can\u2019t agree to that then she is the one playing favorites as you are agreeing to her sister having a much larger impact on your lives than your brother ever did and all you are asking for is the compromise to make it work", "NAH is my verdict. You're trying to do what's right for your family but also have sympathy for your sister in law and her family. Its quite the pickle. Anything more than a week would be a no go for me, especially since you just don't physically have the space. Is there any chance you are in a position to help them with renting a small unit for a little bit? If they were fine with a one bedroom at your place then that should be an acceptable temporary accommodation for them until they can set more permanent roots?", "Find Ann and her family a nice, affordable short term Air B&B and help them house hunt once they arrive.  So glad she's getting her kid out of Florida!\n\nAs you've described it, the impact on your work life was completely different when your bro stayed, so I don't see favoritism.\n\nNAH, but do give Ann & her family all the support and encouragement you can.", "NTA but you should still try to make something work be that helping them find a place or setting terms idk but it is really horrible for gay people in florida right now so i really understand them wanting to leave", "NTA. With no assurance of what happens after a month or two you can end up in a bad situation. \n\nPerhaps offer for one of them to come up and stay to house hunt while the other stays there with the kids and looks there. \n\nWhat happens if in 6 months they don\u2019t have a place to live?", "NTA\u2026I think your reasons are valid and quite appropriate.  Given the housing situation in your area, there is no timeframe for how long 4- additional people will be staying in your home.  The only spare room you have is used as an office since you work remotely.  \n\nI understand wanting to move from Florida to a more accepting and friendly area to the LGBTQ community.  Does those sister in law and her wife have jobs lined up?  What exactly is their plan?", "NAH all valid reasons for not allowing extra guests. As I have seen time and time again on her this a 2 yes, 1 no situation. Your wife is definitely more emotionally invested since this is her sister, but the situation is different than when your brother stayed with you. With that said, she has a right to feel slighted even if it isn't logical.\n\nEven if you weren't working from home, I think it would be tough to manage.", "NAH, I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere where near FL right now, so I\u2019m totally on board with their concerns. But all your points are valid. It\u2019s a really big ask of your family and where are you supposed to work from, if you\u2019ve no office? What about the kids? All one room? \nWhen the household has 2 parents/adults/SO\u2019s, it requires 2 \u201cyes\u201d votes to add roommates, no matter the circumstances. \n\n* Can you guys start hunting for an apartment/house for them?\n* Is there any chance you have those short term rental condos in your area. . . Or an extended stay hotel/motel. \n*  check the local paper for short term lease that they can take over.\n* Short term manufactured home rentals.\n\nI\u2019m sure if all the adults put your heads together, you will come up with a solution. But automatically moving the whole family in on top of yours is not a viable solution. \nYour wife\u2019s knickers are in a twist because (they all) were hoping you would just say OK, and that they would have all the time in the world to search. But they don\u2019t. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "NAH but please reconsider. Anyone who wants to get out of FL because they are queer deserves any help we can give them. :(", "NTA I get the need for a move, but the circumstances are clearly different than with your brother", "I am hesitating between NTA and slightly YTA. \n\n I can see your point (you are afraid of them being there forever) but your wife's point too (she wants to help her sister, and you have already helped your brother).\n\nWould you feel better if you agreed a deadline with them? Also, what kind of people are they? Are they likely to overstay their welcome, or to stick to the schedule and do their best to find their own place ASAP?", "NTA i would suggest accepting on the condition your SIL is already property hunting or rental searching. And if more convenient you can more your 2 sons together to free a room up so your office can remain as it shouldn't be moved since you WFH  itwould be so inappropriate and invasive on top of people joining the household. \nSo then there is 1 room free which is appropriate for 4 for short term stay (if the room is sizeable of course for a double and 2 singles for 4 singles) Thats your conditions as 1 room for 4 can only ever work short term otherwise they and slum it in a hotel room if they dont like it.", "NTA", "NTA - Your house and your boundaries should be important to your wife even if she doesn't like it. You have every right to say no, but I think you need to communicate better with your wife, about your reasons for saying no. Also, might be a good idea to offer a compromise of some sorts - offer to help your in-laws out in other ways that's not them living with you, try to be a part of the solution instead of part of the problem.", "NTA this is a totally different situation then your brother. You had the room now you simply do not. \n\nIf you let them move in this could very well be a very long stay.", "NTA. Logistically, speaking. But, the fact that you did let your brother stay is a bit\u2026not making this seem fair. There are other solutions. Like having them all stay in just that room. A solid time line. Maybe even a rental agreement. Discussion about contributions to the household. Regardless, of if we want to admit it or not, you not trying to help your wife help her sister, your wife not being able to help her sister because of you will damage all of the relationships involved. See if there are ways you can help without putting you all in dire straights either.", "I totally relate to your point of view, and it's hard for me to say that in this situation YTA. Your SIL is living in a place that has become actively dangerous to her family. These are exceptional circumstances. It's going to be chaotic, it's going to be disruptive, it's going to be crowded, and unless your SIL has a history of predatory behavior, it is definitely going to be temporary. If it's too disruptive for you to WFH, perhaps you can go to a cafe, a coworking space, or even your lovely air-conditioned car in the driveway? Work with your wife to set up some procedures and logistics. Make it fun for the kids (camping in the bedrooms, yay!). Be kind, don't add to the trauma. And regarding housing, sometimes things work out. My husband and I found a place and closed within three weeks, in a market that usually had a 3-month lead time.", "YTA.   Do you know what is going on in Florida?   Your sister-in-law wants to get her, her wife and most importantly her gay 15 year old away from that and your response is \"heck no I'm not giving up my work space\".    Meanwhile you were ok with letting your brother and his family come just because of renovations.", "YTA. Helping out family is never a bad thing, and you should imagine yourself in their shoes. The level of support/help you're giving is way higher than the level of nuisance for you.", "YTA - it came out early - \u201cthe 15 yo is gay\u2026\u201d NOT RELEVANT AT ALL!", "YTA and frankly if I were your wife, assuming the house is joint custody, I would be telling you that my sister and family are moving into my half of the house.
