My wife's younger sister, Ann (36F), currently lives in Florida with her GF and 2 kids (15 & 10).  The 15-year old is gay.  Ann's GF obviously isn't the father to her kids.  Ann came out as bisexual about 5 years ago and divorced the kids' father.  I don't know a lot of details about her divorce, but I do know that she was granted primary custody of her kids after a long and tumultuous custody battle.  \n\nLast weekend, my wife came to me and said she needed to talk.  Apparently, Ann's landlord has either refused to renew the lease for the house they rent, or they increased the rent to price Ann out of it, my wife wasn't sure.  As a result, they have to be out of their house June 1st.  Due to recent political events in Florida, Ann wants to move her family out of state.  \n\nMy family lives in a Midwest state that has a much more LGBTQ+ friendly political atmosphere.  Ann told my wife that she and her GF agree that moving their family to our state would be a good move for them.  But given the short timeline for their housing situation, they are up against the clock.  So, Ann asked my wife if they could stay with us while they find a place for them to live.  \n\nI told my wife I have a lot of reservations about that idea.  We only have 1 extra bedroom, so sleeping arrangements would be difficult and would probably involve moving kids into rooms together.  Also, I currently WFH and my office space is located in that extra bedroom, so my work situation would be directly impacted.  I don't have a physical office to go to for work.  Also, the housing market in our area is pretty tough right now.  Houses are going for above market price and selling fast.  The rental market isn't any better.  All of that leads me to believe that if Ann and her family come stay with us, it won't be short-term.  And the people most directly impacted by this will be me and our kids, not my wife.    \n\nI explained all of this to my wife and told her I don't think it's a good idea.  I told her I feel bad for the situation Ann and her family is in, but she's asking a lot of our family and I don't feel like we are in the proper position to take them in.  \n\nMy wife did not like my response one bit.  She accused me of not caring about her sister and that we took my brother and his family in short-term before.  Which is true, but a vastly different situation.  My brother was having some renovations done on his home and we were given a concrete timeframe for their stay.  The work permit on their renovation had an end-date that work needed to be completed by, so we knew exactly how long they would be staying.  They ended up staying a week less than they expected.  And at that time our 2 youngest were still sharing a room anyway so we had 2 extra bedrooms and I wasn't working from home. She sees this as me playing favorites with my family versus hers and thinks I am being an AH.", "created_utc": 1684528614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m711o/aita_for_not_letting_my_inlaws_move_in_with_us/", "score": 1935, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You also had more room when your bro needed temporary accommodation. You and your wife need to know A LOT more about her sister\u2019s situation before you open your home to them. \n\nRight now, NAH. I totally see your side, and I totally see your wife\u2019s side.", "NTA. You articulated clear and cogent reasons for declining to allow them to stay with you. You\u2019ve also differentiated between this situation and the situation with your brother in a few huge ways: finality of timeline, lack of space, work circumstances. \n\nI understand your wife wants to help her sister, but this just doesn\u2019t feel like a reasonable ask to me. You\u2019re right that yourself and your kids will be most impacted by this, and also that if the housing market is bad, their \u201ctemporary\u201d stay could become indefinite.", "NAH - I don't think they were at all wrong to ask considering the circumstances (though, I do have questions like... do they have jobs lined up? And if not, how are they going to buy a house? And if custody was a battle, are they even going to get cleared to leave the state with the kids??).\n\nI think the situation with your brother *was* different; it's going to be way more cramped and way longer term. No one in the house is going to enjoy this. Like how many showers for how many people is it going to be?\n\nThat said, I can see why your wife would be hurt by this because she's not thinking about logistics here; she's just thinking with her heart and wanting to shelter her family from a bad situation.\n\nI would try to come up with some other ideas/options to help them out.", "NTA. However, so she can\u2019t accuse you of playing favorites, create a concrete contract. Explain it to your wife that your brother had a specific reason and a specific end date due to the contacts he signed for his own home that would get him back out of your house by a specific date. If her sister is to move in then you want that same guarantee. A specific end date. Tell her you also need a solution to your office problem before they move in. If that be a man shed or whatever but that your work can\u2019t be impacted on such a critical level and that it hadn\u2019t been when your brother was there bc you were still in office. Yes the kids would have to share for a bit but here again, make the concrete rules. Your kids are having to share to allow her kids to be there, which means the space that is for them is for them and not the cousins. Tell her that if she can\u2019t agree to that then she is the one playing favorites as you are agreeing to her sister having a much larger impact on your lives than your brother ever did and all you are asking for is the compromise to make it work", "NAH is my verdict. You're trying to do what's right for your family but also have sympathy for your sister in law and her family. Its quite the pickle. Anything more than a week would be a no go for me, especially since you just don't physically have the space. Is there any chance you are in a position to help them with renting a small unit for a little bit? If they were fine with a one bedroom at your place then that should be an acceptable temporary accommodation for them until they can set more permanent roots?", "Find Ann and her family a nice, affordable short term Air B&B and help them house hunt once they arrive.  So glad she's getting her kid out of Florida!\n\nAs you've described it, the impact on your work life was completely different when your bro stayed, so I don't see favoritism.\n\nNAH, but do give Ann & her family all the support and encouragement you can.", "NTA but you should still try to make something work be that helping them find a place or setting terms idk but it is really horrible for gay people in florida right now so i really understand them wanting to leave", "NTA. With no assurance of what happens after a month or two you can end up in a bad situation. \n\nPerhaps offer for one of them to come up and stay to house hunt while the other stays there with the kids and looks there. \n\nWhat happens if in 6 months they don\u2019t have a place to live?", "NTA\u2026I think your reasons are valid and quite appropriate.  Given the housing situation in your area, there is no timeframe for how long 4- additional people will be staying in your home.  The only spare room you have is used as an office since you work remotely.  \n\nI understand wanting to move from Florida to a more accepting and friendly area to the LGBTQ community.  Does those sister in law and her wife have jobs lined up?  What exactly is their plan?", "NAH all valid reasons for not allowing extra guests. As I have seen time and time again on her this a 2 yes, 1 no situation. Your wife is definitely more emotionally invested since this is her sister, but the situation is different than when your brother stayed with you. With that said, she has a right to feel slighted even if it isn't logical.\n\nEven if you weren't working from home, I think it would be tough to manage.", "NAH, I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere where near FL right now, so I\u2019m totally on board with their concerns. But all your points are valid. It\u2019s a really big ask of your family and where are you supposed to work from, if you\u2019ve no office? What about the kids? All one room? \nWhen the household has 2 parents/adults/SO\u2019s, it requires 2 \u201cyes\u201d votes to add roommates, no matter the circumstances. \n\n* Can you guys start hunting for an apartment/house for them?\n* Is there any chance you have those short term rental condos in your area. . . Or an extended stay hotel/motel. \n*  check the local paper for short term lease that they can take over.\n* Short term manufactured home rentals.\n\nI\u2019m sure if all the adults put your heads together, you will come up with a solution. But automatically moving the whole family in on top of yours is not a viable option . \nYour wife\u2019s knickers are in a twist because (they all) were hoping you would just say OK, and that they would have all the time in the world to search. But they don\u2019t. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "NAH but please reconsider. Anyone who wants to get out of FL because they are queer deserves any help we can give them. :(", "NTA I get the need for a move, but the circumstances are clearly different than with your brother", "I am hesitating between NTA and slightly YTA. \n\n I can see your point (you are afraid of them being there forever) but your wife's point too (she wants to help her sister, and you have already helped your brother).\n\nWould you feel better if you agreed a deadline with them? Also, what kind of people are they? Are they likely to overstay their welcome, or to stick to the schedule and do their best to find their own place ASAP?", "NTA i would suggest accepting on the condition your SIL is already property hunting or rental searching. And if more convenient you can more your 2 sons together to free a room up so your office can remain as it shouldn't be moved since you WFH  itwould be so inappropriate and invasive on top of people joining the household. \nSo then there is 1 room free which is appropriate for 4 for short term stay (if the room is sizeable of course for a double and 2 singles for 4 singles) Thats your conditions as 1 room for 4 can only ever work short term otherwise they and slum it in a hotel room if they dont like it.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA this is a totally different situation then your brother. You had the room now you simply do not. \n\nIf you let them move in this could very well be a very long stay.", "NTA. Logistically, speaking. But, the fact that you did let your brother stay is a bit\u2026not making this seem fair. There are other solutions. Like having them all stay in just that room. A solid time line. Maybe even a rental agreement. Discussion about contributions to the household. Regardless, of if we want to admit it or not, you not trying to help your wife help her sister, your wife not being able to help her sister because of you will damage all of the relationships involved. See if there are ways you can help without putting you all in dire straights either.", "I totally relate to your point of view, and it's hard for me to say that in this situation YTA. Your SIL is living in a place that has become actively dangerous to her family. These are exceptional circumstances. It's going to be chaotic, it's going to be disruptive, it's going to be crowded, and unless your SIL has a history of predatory behavior, it is definitely going to be temporary. If it's too disruptive for you to WFH, perhaps you can go to a cafe, a coworking space, or even your lovely air-conditioned car in the driveway? Work with your wife to set up some procedures and logistics. Make it fun for the kids (camping in the bedrooms, yay!). Be kind, don't add to the trauma. And regarding housing, sometimes things work out. My husband and I found a place and closed within three weeks, in a market that usually had a 3-month lead time.", "YTA.   Do you know what is going on in Florida?   Your sister-in-law wants to get her, her wife and most importantly her gay 15 year old away from that and your response is \"heck no I'm not giving up my work space\".    Meanwhile you were ok with letting your brother and his family come just because of renovations.", "YTA. Helping out family is never a bad thing, and you should imagine yourself in their shoes. The level of support/help you're giving is way higher than the level of nuisance for you.", "YTA - it came out early - \u201cthe 15 yo is gay\u2026\u201d NOT RELEVANT AT ALL!", "YTA and frankly if I were your wife, assuming the house is joint custody, I would be telling you that my sister and family are moving into my half of the house.

Can you imagine trying to work from the couch with eight other people carrying on their daily routines? Is there anywhere else in the house that you can set up shop, and put them *all* in that room? If not, then residential camping it is.\n\nIs there room and allowance for a camper or rv that they could live in? \n\nEdit: I know FL is an absolute shitshow, and if I were them I\u2019d be packing up, too. But it has to be done smartly.", "Nta here at all.  You don't have a guest room,that's your office. \n\nDo you have space for a camper van on your property?? That would take care of the sleeping arrangements as an alternative and share the living spaces - bathrooms/kitchen/living room.  Alongside some clear boundaries around noise during your working hours. And a clear time frame for moving out.  Have they a realistic expectation of housing costs?", "NTA\n\nYour wife is being an A because she wasn\u2019t really asking. Her reaction shows that she had her mind made up already on what you as a family were going to do. Just hold your ground and I\u2019m sure she will get it but do try and provide some support for her sister\u2019s family. \n\nAlso real estate is crazy right now in addition to that the job market is very strange. It\u2019s going to likely take them longer to get jobs than they think. Things will be alright eventually but this will be a very bumpy road.", "I mean no you're not an asshole because everything you said is reasonable and they likely would be in your house for a whole. But Florida is horrible for them. Maybe you could help them in some other way? Or maybe other family can?", "INFO: how long did your brother stay for his renovations? Saying they stayed for a week less than expected leads me to believe it wasn't a short term thing.", "NAH your points are all perfectly valid until you add in that you made this work for your family. \n\nThe situations are different but I can see how this must make your wife feel. From her point of view she made it work when you needed her to to support your family and you should do the same for hers.\n\nPut whatever limitations on it you want but talk to your wife and try to find a way to help her family or she will never forget it.", "Info: how long, all up, did your brother end up staying?  I do think it\u2019s be fair to give your SIL that amount of time. Could you give her a short-term lease? Explain that this is about equity and that she has to leave after that? (Assuming your wife is on board and If you trusted that she wouldn\u2019t squat after)", "NTA - you have valid, logical reasons.\n\nThat being said, when my sister fled from her husband (with her 3 children) and she called me, despite not having ANY extra bedroom, my SO said nothing other than \"they're family of course we'll make it work\" and we did. It was tight and we were on top of each other for over a year. Yes, there were some tense moments (especially when she posted some very anti-immigrant BS on social media, while enjoying the roof over her head and the food in her belly that was provided by an immigrant). But I wouldn't do anything different if the same thing happened tomorrow. \n\nAsk yourself what you would want Ana to do for you if you lost your home. Ask yourself if you're teaching your children that family is only important as long as you aren't inconvenienced by them.", "NTA. Guests are like fish, they start to smell after three days. I wouldn't accept any relatives, mine or spouses, into my home without a set date for leaving. Did that mistake once and learned my lesson. Having extra people around always interferes with your family life and causes extra friction and all kinds of problems. \nOur close friends actually have a similar situation to  OP's, where the husband's sister moved in with them because she's \"looking for work\" in the area. \"As soon as she gets on her feet, she's moving out\" says the husband/brother. \nIt's been over a year, she hasn't worked a day and the wife is a nervous wreck. She doesn't contribute anything to the household and kids are also fed up with their aunt, since she's the cause of their mothers nervousness. \nYou can, and should, help the family but don't do it with the expense of your own family.", "NAH. Can you help them look into housing options in your state?", "I understand your concerns about the housing market in your area but your state likely has other areas they could explore to live in that would be more affordable while still being closer to your family. I say if you and your wife can agree on a reasonable amount of time, 4-6 weeks you should do it to help them out. \nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH but I do think you could find workable solutions instead of just saying no.", "NTA. While your state is more friendly,  it doesn't mean they can make a home quickly.  I'd recommend they consider a RV or Travel trailer mobile home (used) type situation.  It will force them to downsize, but after months of avoiding storage fees,  they'd be able to afford to acquire what they need once they find jobs and a more permanent home.  It's also easy for them to move about while exploring locations and options.", "NTA. They should get temp housing in FL ou a short extension on the lease.  Then one of the adults can stay with you for a couple weeks trine up a job and housing.", "Nta, OP has sound reasoning, rooted in practicality and not emotion like his wife", "Could you perhaps give them space in you garden a motorhome/caravan as a middle ground to your wife? Shes understandablly a bit upset she cant help her sister and niblings and you've given a reasonable explanation of how that would really disrupt your family and realistically your income. NTA but it's important to her so maybe help with some other possible solutions?", "NTA\u2026 it\u2019s a huge ask\u2026 with an indefinite timeline especially if you have children AND wfh it\u2019s important to have your space\u2026 I\u2019m sure they would understand? Aren\u2019t there short term rentals or a sublet they can get in the meantime?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a spare room. What used to be the spare room is now your office, and you need it. Kicking your own kids out of their rooms for an unspecified length of time is unfair, and that many people in the house rarely goes well anyway. They\u2019re adults, let them sort it out themselves.", "INFO. Do you have some reason to believe your SIL is some kind of layabout? Because she sounds pretty motivated to me. She's moving her family out of a state that's becoming increasingly hostile to families like hers.\n\nIt sounds like you wouldn't pull the trigger on a rental until it checks every box on your wish list, with a spare bedroom. Is that the kind of person your SIL is?\n\nWhat \"negative effects\" do you foresee for your kids from sharing a bedroom and general living space with their cousins in need? Do you not recognize that a bit of self-sacrifice can also build character?", "NAH, but I feel like the other comments are underselling how bad things are in Florida for your sister-in-law and her family. I think there's a middle ground between squeezing nine people into a house for an indefinite period of time and doing nothing. Can you host the adults if they come up for job interviews? Can you float them money for a deposit as long as they can cover rent? Can you help anyone find a job/give a reference? Can you help them with the move so they can save on expenses? Are you able to front them a few months paying for a storage unit so they don't have to worry about their stuff? I think your concerns are valid, but I don't want this to become another rendition of this sub's obsessive \"you don't owe anything to anybody\" stance. It's a sad situation, and I understand why your wife is upset right now, I hope the two of you are able to find some way to help her sister. Good luck.", "NTA. I\u2019m WFH too and I\u2019d never give up my working place, because it\u2019s a primary source of income for my family. Not even considering other (valid) points you\u2019ve made.", "NTA. Who knows how long it will take them to find a house to move into? They could be living with you for a year or maybe longer! If they're in such a tight spot this doesn't seem like the time to look for their dream home and move out of state, they need something practical fast. It sucks but I have a feeling they will lean on you a lot and will definitely overstay their welcome. I'm guessing they'll also have to look for other jobs not just a house so it will be quite a lengthy process. You're not an A for not wanting to be in an uncomfortable, possibly pricey situation.", "NAH", "if you must, have exactly the same conditions as your brother had.  And exact, no compromising end date.", "I don\u2019t understand how everyone seems to be taking into account how uncomfortable it might be to have to rearrange guest rooms and home offices, when these are people trying to move away from a state where they themselves and their family are very literally in danger and more so everyday horrendous laws are passed specifically targeting them. How does that not register as a basic human emergency?! How does that not warrant some temporary discomfort?", "NTA, but yeah, your family staying with you was also an inconvenience on your family.  Some of your comments sound like you don't like your sister's family much, so that's also playing a part.", "I can understand your wife been upset you took your brother and his family in, and you have said no to her sister in a time she wants to help her. She's her family, so she will always want to help. \nBUT you have given her quite a few reasons why things are not ideal.\n\nLike you have said, the kids are older now and have their own rooms. It's not fair on your kids to be made to share again. Maybe a week, yes, but you don't actually know how long it would be. \nDepending on if your kids are girls/boys, then different sex siblings shouldn't really be sharing. The same goes for her kids. The 3 older kids will all want their own rooms so they can unwind alone. Plus, the boy/girl issue for sharing, more so than the younger 2.\nLike you said with how things are property wise, you won't know how long they will be there. It could be going on a year for them to save up and find somewhere in the price range. They don't even have jobs yet. \nYou will have to give up the room you use for your office, so where would you work? Downstairs where 3 adults, 3 teens/almost teens , and 2 children are? All talking, playing, kids arguing, older ones arguing, TV been on loud. How are you going to manage to work with everything going off? Or are you supposed to work in the car? \n\nWithout sounding harsh, they have made the choice to move states, it shouldn't fall on you and your family to have to have to change everything in regards to your home and sanity for their choice in moving and not having a place lined up already. \n\nFor your wife's sake and your marriage, you could say yes, BUT with a time limit. The only thing with that is they may not be sorted in that time. They will ask to stay longer, therefore putting you in an impossible position. \n\nThink wisely. Good luck because either way, you are going to need it.", "NTA where are you supposed to work to do your job the thing that pays for the house that doesn\u2019t have room for them. Your wife isn\u2019t thinking about how badly this will effect your home. No time line is never a good idea.", "NTA where are you supposed to work to do your job the thing that pays for the house that doesn\u2019t have room for them. Your wife isn\u2019t thinking about how badly this will effect your home. No time line is never a good idea.", "Listen man. Look at Florida. Really look at it. Your sister in law is a political refugee from a state that hates her family. I'm not saying that it'd be comfortable or nice to have them living with you. But I am saying that they would probably prefer camping in your backyard and surviving on eating the grass to staying in that state.\n\nMaybe if you can, find another way to help them. In whatever way you can. But the state is actively becoming more hostile to them by the day, and that's *by design*. I don't have a rating for you. Just please do consider helping in another way if this isn't possible for you.", "NTA\n\nWould they be okay if you set up a tent in the back yard for them to sleep in.  Maybe they can provide a caravan for a little extra comfort.  They can utilise the kitchen and bathroom but that's an issue in itself.  One bathroom for 7 people is asking a lot.  And that's assuming you have an ensuite... which I guess could be used too.\n\nThe problem is that you physically don't have enough space.  The only way this would work is if the sister and GF took your bedroom and the 2 kids took the room that is currently your study/work area.  And you and your wife converted the lounge room or other living area into your bedroom and work space.  The reason I suggest this is that this will impact your wife more than the scenario she has in mind... which would mean that it wouldn't be long term.", "\ud83d\udcaf%this.\n\nBut also I was thinking despite Ana having primary custody, you can't just move kids to other state. I understand problem she is in but those kids still have father, taking away kids it's big NO NO in my eyes and probably law.", "This, NTA.", "I like this. Let the wife experience how it\u2019ll feel.", "OP stated they have the money to rent, but they refuse to because they want to buy. Smh. Sounds like they\u2019re trying to take advantage of free housing.", "Lol, no. Moving 4 people into a house that only has one empty bedroom is not at all a reasonable request.", "You really think his wife will make her sister and family move out after 2 weeks if they haven't found jobs or a house to buy or rent? She won't, and they will become tenants who may have to be evicted if it goes over 30 days, in most states. \n\nThis marriage will implode before they move out.", "Not his family right- he can only make concessions when his brother and their family need the help- when it comes to the wife\u2019s sister all the hypothetical problems of how long they will stay come up. There are always a thousand reasons to say no-", "He said the brother stayed for 15 days.", "A valid point I hadn\u2019t considered.", "SIL works in retail and GF is a bartender which means they both do not make very much money.  They are probably pay check to pay check with deep deep credit card debt and other debt.  They have probably been evicted from their apartment in Florida by not paying rent.  There is a reason why your wife doesn't know the true reason they are being kicked out....it's because they don't have the money.  If you let them move in, you will be financially supporting them and their kids for years to come.", "How are the kid's relationship with their dad? and does he live in a liberal state. if so can't the kids move in with him. I get ann probably does not want to lose custody but it is the right thing to do since they do not have another option", "The governor is a full on fascist. And is passing the laws you'd expect one to pass.", "He already mentioned they have a savings, they just want to save it for a down-payment instead of rent. A bartender in FL can make bank,  if they're in the right area.", "I am not assuming they will be ah at all but I work from home . I had my parents visit and they at 60 y o can t always stop themselves from coming in to talk to me.\n\n\nYou are talking about two teenagers on vacation here and two adults on top of op s kids.\n\nYou think it's fair to have to ask the teenagers to either don't move too much, don't make noise=don't do anything in the house or leave while op works? They don't even have a space to retire to.\n\nOne of the adults is a bartender so she probably work in the evening .is she supposed to be sent out of the house till op finished work?

I\u2019m sure to go straight to a conversion camp, no pun intended.

If they can make arrangements for the kids to go stay with dad early/possibly stay with him for the summer and they will be able to afford a place when they get there, it could be workable. \n\nMaybe your wife could even find an apartment that will put them on a wait list, so you know there will be an end point. \n\n I've found places for friends/fam moving from out of state a couple of times and it has worked out. Even in a tight market there are property managers who will help in these situations.", "Do you not understand what\u2019s happening in Florida?", "To tack on, the governor is trying to drive out a company that provides hundreds (if not thousands) of jobs and millions in tax revenue because they more or less asked him to chill the homophobia.\n\n[They just canceled a project that would inject one billion dollars into the states economy over it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/business/disney-ron-desantis-florida.html)", "Messy is an understatement.
