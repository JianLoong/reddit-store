I had many male friends try it to see", "Temperature would be one. Pee should be warm (body temperature). If it's room temperature or colder, that would be a dead giveaway.

Betablockers do too so if they're also banned that would be why. So potentially could affect shooting? Being hungover wouldn't help I imagine, but the alcohol itself might be. Or maybe they just don't want impaired people shooting things which is reasonable.", "Ass ghost. We all have them but most people are in denial.", "Smoking for pain management is one thing. Puffing pot wildly like a college bro is another.", "I belong to a progressive multicultural LGBTQ+ friendly Catholic parish.

If a man ever tests positive for a pregnancy test when trying one for fun then he should still go and get checked by a doctor because it isn\u2019t a sure fire way of knowing, but it has helped some men catch it early on if they went to a doctor afterwards.", "Someone peed on a pregnancy test for fun to see what would happen and got a surprise, I imagine.", "more likely than not, they took urine from a group of men with diagnosed testicular cancer and looked at the proteins they had in their urine va men who didn\u2019t have testicular cancer", "Nah, you look for a PSA in that situation", "The thing the person you replied to said is one of those \"reddit told me this once so now I gotta say it every time it comes up\" things even though other things can cause it to be positive and also only specific tests and specific types of testicular cancer do this.", "It will show positive on a pregnancy test if the person peeing smoked weed?", "Damn you got a lot of cancer among your friends", "Thanks for the info. \ud83d\udc4d", "Oh sure, I don't think anyone here's arguing it, but the practicality is that scholarships may hinge on it, and in that scenario, maybe just lay off the weed for a few years rather than calling for your sister to piss in a cup and drive for an hour with it.", "*Ross Rebagliati has entered the chat*\n\nThough weed was subsequently officially banned by the IOC, that seemed to be more about image than performance benefits.", "> The same weed that turns people into Antifa Supersoldiers, presumably\n\nLet's all thank our sponsor Shitty Light Beer for sponsoring this drug-free sport!", "True that!
