It\u2019s not like he needed her blood to save his life", "No way, dude. As an avid pot smoker, myself, in no universe does OP even suck a little bit. Period.\n\n1. If the stakes are that high for OP's brother, then he should keep his nose clean. Or keep a bottle of Quik Fix on hand. Or he needs to figure this shit out himself. \n\n2. 2 hour drive is A LOT to ask someone to drive just to drop off pee as a favor to yoi, if it was that important to the brothwr he'd find a way to go get it from OP.\n\n3. They test for hormones in the urine, and they wouldn't have known its not his pee by the abundance of female hormones in the urine. \n\nShe owes him no apology.", "It\u2019s likely not just what you think of as drugs. I did a sport where we were tested for caffeine, alcohol and a number of substances in prescription and over the counter medications. Even if you went abroad, you couldn\u2019t trust something that was safe over the counter in the UK wasn\u2019t free of ergogenic substances in the US for example.\n\nHe signed up to those restrictions and consented to the consequences. Why should someone do a 2 hour round trip when he could be unfairly winning over competitors by doping or potentially taking a space away from an athlete who can perform legally?", "Alternatively, do you have any pregnant friends with a mildly twisted sense of humor?", "\u201cHey athlete, when\u2019s the baby due\u201d *shocked pikachu face*", "Omg that would have been amazing.", "Not just that. Female urine is very different from male urine. He would have been in deeper poo using hers.", "[removed]", "[\"OP, you have testicular cancer\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/4ou65c/rage_comic_leads_to_diagnosis_of_testicular_cancer/)", "I think I read somewhere that happens when you have testicular cancer. So that would be even more trouble.", "Although smoking weed regularly is not consistent with the physical requirements of being a professional athlete. Brother needs to start treating his body like a temple if he's actually serious about his future career.\n\nMe? My body is not a temple. It's a church. Full of bread. And wine. And guilt.", "If it\u2019s to test for steroids they will check not necessarily for gender but for T levels since steroids increase testosterone.", "I used to be an athlete and I noticed that on the few times I gave a sample, they\u2019d label it and they had a male and female side as we obviously didn\u2019t compete against the same sex and the collar ranges were different on each side. Women\u2019s were a greenish yellow and men\u2019s were a more orange yellow in comparison. Obviously there could be local dietary influences etc and we were all on strict regimes but I do wonder if they could just tell by color. I didn\u2019t obviously pick individual samples and look it was just noticeable in the collective.", ">There are actually no laws against giving out your urine. \n\nAre you confident that there are no laws anywhere in the world that prohibit this.

In fact she shouldn't do it.\n\nBut her reason sucks big time. So, if her house was nearby, she was willing to go through this?", ">So her brother deserves to to lie and be a fraud\n\nIt's real life, people lie and defraud all sorts of things. College level drug tests are such a minor thing to care about. It's the jaywalking of sports. No one outside of reddit cares about this.", ">She owes him no apology.\n\nYeah if she wants to never douse the fire that her brother set. My approach to AITA is how to tackle real life, not apply vindictive judgement.", "And they'd probably figure out why he did that", "[removed]", "There are definitely laws against giving someone your urine if they don't want you to do that.", "Damn poppy seed bagels!", "I read his explanation, and I kinda get his reasoning. She seems to be more annoyed by the driving part than the actual cheating part. \n\n\n I feel that OP 's brother is the kind of guy who thinks that you HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING to protect family members. It's a very weird place to be for OP and extremely manipulative.  \n\nI do get and understand that family comes first, and I'll do anything to protect my loved ones. But lying and cheating when it can impact both of us? I don't think so. If caught, he can be in more trouble than before.", "You sound like an awesome person to rely on; I'm sure friends and family have learned to never inconvenience you for things since your time is so utterly important", "Then he should just pee in the cup himself plain and simple since it\u2019s not a big deal and not try to make his sister do it what is he gonna do since this is his \u201cpotential career\u201d always find someone else to pee for him?", "No. Full stop. This is cheating and should be punishable by way of capital punishment. OP shouldn't ever do anything for anybody that she doesn't want to if a brother is in a pinch and needs them.", "Again, you don't where people live and which country's laws apply to them.", "I think they were pretty much joking that it's illegal to urinate on someone in a lot of places.\n\nNice shifting goalposts though?", "oh lol, you are right.
