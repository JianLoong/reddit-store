We\u2019ve been living pretty well together, no issues. But this week randomly I came home from work and there was a strange man sleeping on our couch (which is between my bedroom and the kitchen). I\u2019ve never seen this man in my life, I was never warned or asked about him sleeping there, so it freaked me out when I came home alone one day and saw him. I thought someone broke in! I didn\u2019t think it could be anyone\u2019s friend because it was 4pm and no one was home! Also when I got home the door was unlocked.\n\nI ran to our bedroom then called my husband right away and he said he had no clue but don\u2019t call the cops yet. So he called our roommates and they said oh yeah that\u2019s our friend who lives in his car, he has no place to stay tonight. He\u2019ll just stay for the night. So we said okay.\n\nFast forward and it\u2019s been a week now. I\u2019m always the first to get off work and come home so I\u2019m always alone at home. I come home every day and this guy is still sleeping on the couch. I feel so uncomfortable. And honestly upset because I was never warned about this before.\n\nI called my husband again when I got home from work early with a migraine and saw the man is sleeping under 3 of my blankets on the couch this time. With crumbs of food on the floor, dried up food on plates stacked on the coffee table. ALSO the heater was turned to 89 degrees !? its 56 degrees outside! I guess I just lost my patience. I told my husband I feel so uncomfortable and said if this guy is going to stay here longer maybe he should pay rent or utilities. My husband got angry and said I\u2019m exaggerating; that the roommates are just helping a friend in need. He also told me the guy\u2019s car got towed too and he can\u2019t afford to pay the tow fee so he may stay with us indefinitely. He told me \u201cwouldn\u2019t you help your friend too?\u201d He has a point so I feel super guilty now.\n\nI get it. I would help a friend too. But i think my whole thing is that I was never warned about any of this. I would never spring it on them without saying anything and also lie about how long they were staying (1 night!? They knew his car was towed). In any case I would\u2019ve asked my roommates first.\n\nPlease someone tell me if I\u2019m in the wrong. If I am, I\u2019ll acknowledge and apologize for that\u2026. It\u2019s just hard to see it right now with the emotions so I\u2019m hoping someone else can help me see the truth.", "created_utc": 1683250331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1386ly3/aita_for_being_upset_that_a_strange_man_is_now/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone new \"moving in\" to a housing situation is something that needs a \"yes\" vote from all of you. It's messed up that they put you in this position, especially since you are the only woman and you come home first. Does your husband even know this dude or just the two other roommates? Nevermind, because it doesn't matter. Your husband should keep your comfort and safety at the top of his mind. You should always be prioritized over some random guy. Also, this man will never move out. And him using your blankets and getting shit all over them? Wtf? This dude is already showing disrespect to the house and the people in it, and it's only been a week. I recommend looking for somewhere else to live, either with your husband or not. This situation is not going to change.\n\nEdit: a word", "NTA. Your husband and roommates need to realize that a random guy crashing on your couch is VERY different experience for a woman. You\u2019re the only woman there and it sounds like you\u2019re also alone in the house nearly every day. If it were me I\u2019d tell my husband if he\u2019s staying on the couch, I\u2019m staying with a friend until he\u2019s gone. You deserve to be comfortable in your own home.\n\nEdit for typo!", "NTA. You aren\u2019t wrong. I would be withholding any money I contribute until the guy is gone. This isn\u2019t about helping someone. It\u2019s about all 3 of your roommates disrespecting you.", "NTA. The living room is a shared space. If the roommate/friend wants them to live there. They can get an air mattress and have that in their room.", "NTA But this is very suspect. \n\nHe's homeless and unemployed. His only housing and transportation has been towed. He is not actively looking for work or providing any service in exchange for a place to stay. And his only contribution seems to be hanging out with his boys. \n\nHere's my concern, he has either an addiction issue, a mental health issue or both. None of this precludes your tolerance or compassion. But your husband and roommates have put in a very unsafe position by not giving you any warning or information to make an informed decision about whether this is a situation you find tenable.", "Nta and If they don\u2019t kick him out, you need to run.", "NTA. There\u2019s a random homeless guy living in your house now. Tell your husband to fix this problem, or move out and let him live with the rando.", "NTA not for a second.\n\nHe couldn't have shown basic courtesy and asked you?\n\nConsider turfing him and his random bludger to the kerb. This is outrageous.", "NTA, that\u2019s a huge breach of trust and privacy.  You don\u2019t know if this guy is going to steal from you or attack you, or set up cameras in your room or bathroom.  All of these things happen.   Your roommates are not in a position to have their friends stay over.  You could get in trouble with the landlord, it\u2019s just not ok.", "NTA.  I would help a friend but not indefinitely.  I also would let everyone in the house know what is going on beforehand.  I don't blame you for being upset.", "NTA- It\u2019s just common decency to notify roommates of any changes of the living space. Your current roommates failed to do that. I\u2019d feel as though a boundary was crossed as well.", "NTA, if this happened to me, I would move out ASAP. Your husband doesn't respect you and he wants to live with random homeless guys and does not care about your safety or privacy of your home.", "NTA. First, they needed to ask if he could stay at all, second, he was only supposed to be there one night, third, you didn't give him permission to use your blankets, fourth, he needs to clean up after himself, fifth, he needs to leave the thermostat alone.\n\nWho owns the home? If it's a rental you need to check the lease. You can't have your living room usurped. He needs to go.", "I wish more roomies would work out ground rules for guests ahead of time.  We\u2019ve lived in several households where the rule was anyone can have a guest with no notice for up to 3 days and then they must leave.  Worked well.  NTA for wanting a low stress home.", "NTA but why are you and your husband living with 2/3 other people?", "NTA and at a certain point getting rid of him will require a legal eviction.", "NTA. I am so sorry you are dealing with this. But please try to see this as an opportunity to learn how to articulate your boundaries and NOT take on feelings of guilt. As women, we are often conditioned to please others at the expense of listening to our own intuition and voice. Please see this as an opportunity to break that pattern.\n\nThis is your home. You share it with roommates who pay rent. This is not a halfway house or a charity. It is your sanctuary where you deserve to feel safe. Your house. YOUR rules. Whatever their \"friend\" is going through is not your problem to deal with. If his friends and your husband feel like helping him out, they are free to do so outside your home. You should not be subject to an unsafe and uncomfortable living environemnt.\n\nYou are allowed to say NO. You are allowed to have this individual removed from your home. There is NO apology needed. You do not have to please everyone around you. Honor yourself. Listen to yourself. Trust yourself. Stand up for yourself and your needs.\n\nYour husband should have your back in this. Consider seeking out a licensed therapist to help you work on developing your voice and overcoming guilt programming.", "NTA OP.  I would have called the cops if I saw someone I didn\u2019t know sleeping on my couch, no matter their circumstances.", "NTA.. Can you safely get out of this?\n\nYou're not wrong or crazy, this isn't normal.", "NTA, but I would move out if possible and ensure none of your finances were going to the rental or the house, because you as a tenant did not agree for him to be there.\n\nYu could make an anonymous tip to the landlord about someone staying in the apartment complex that is not on the lease.  \"I've see a strange person coming and going from this apartment lately\"", "NTA but kinda the idiot for choosing to get married to(for lack of a better term) an frat boy, someone who puts his friend before you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
