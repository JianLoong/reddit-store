{"id": 26794, "submission_id": "16i0wzf", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter she is part of the reason for my divorce?", "selftext": "This started about 6 months ago when my wife, lets call her Emily (42f), was out of town on a business trip and I (43m) was taking care of my daughter (14f), lets call her Erica. During that trip Erica was hanging out with a few friends after school and got caught by their parents smoking weed. They notified me and obviously I was pretty livid. I was devising my punishment and part of that punishment was her having to explain to her mother about what happened. When she called my wife to tell her instead of saying what she had done she lied and said she came home to another woman at our house.\n\nI think this was an attempt to get out of trouble and has instead created a massive rift between me and my soon to be Emily. Erica did eventually admit to lying about me cheating, but Emily has refused to believe the revision and has zero trust for me now. She has demanded to prove I am not cheating, has looked through my phone multiple times, was looking at my credit card transactions, and even demanded I allow her to track my phone which I refused. After a few weeks of this I changed my passwords to my credit cards and phone and things have been extremely tense ever since. Emily refused to trust me or work on our issues.\n\nLast week, I gave Emily papers for divorce because I am not going to live with someone that refuses to trust me or works on it at all. When we told Erica we were getting a divorce she was notably upset. She said something about it being all her fault and I responded with \"A little bit\". Not my proudest moment and I mostly blame Emily, but Erica started us down this path. Emily called me an asshole and said it is my fault, which I don't under stand, and Erica was even more upset after the comment. AITA?\n\nEdit: I have never cheated before. she has had previous partners cheat, but that was 15 years ago.\n\nAs some have mentioned, no we were not perfect and maybe I didn't realize how bad things were. We had been in couples therapy for awhile which she refused to do anymore after this. I thought it was just people that have been together for so long stuff, but maybe she was looking for a reason to end it.", "created_utc": 1694643922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16i0wzf/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_is_part_of_the/", "score": 1721, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is there a history that maybe needs to considered?", ">Emily called me an asshole and said it is my fault, which I don't under stand, \n\nI think it is because she believes that you did have a woman over and that Erica told her the truth.  \n\nEmily truly thinks you cheated, so it would be your fault.  She likely thinks you will move in with the affair partner ASAP.  \n\nErica will be paying for this for the foreseeable future.  I bet Emily will quiz her about if you have a woman over or any women's clothing in your closet after every visitation.  \n\nNTA.  Kids need to learn consequences.  Sorry they are so heart-rending.", "Nta\n\nYour daughter needs to understand that there are consequences for her actions. Unfortunately you are the one really paying them.", "NTA. Your daughter did something almost unforgivable. It was a heinous act, and she's old enough to know right from wrong.  When you commit a heinous act, there SHOULD be consequences.", "I don't even know here, man. If this story is actually as you say it is....I'm really sorry.

There's always two sides to a story and I have no idea who is TAH.", "Holy shit, your daughter is going to need therapy", "NTA\n\nTalk about being shot lying down. You can do everything right and still be blamed for everything geezes. 14 yo is old enough to understand actions have consequences maybe now she'll think twice before telling such a fucking idiotic lie. It's SUCH a stupid thing to lie about I can understand why Emily wouldn't believe it's a lie and instead think you coerced her into revising her version of the events.", "NTA. She is 15 not 5. She absolutely knew what she did when she chose to lie. The particular lie might have been a panic choice but she also chose to not take it back and admit at once. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d be fair to say the bears at least 40% of the blame.", "Oof. Normally this would be an automatic Y T A for me but her lie wasn't small and she was old enough to know better.

At all. Your wife and daughter seem absolutely horrible though....", "Erica can be as upset as she wants, but hopefully there's a truckload of guilt thrown in there as well.  She did start the entire mess.\n\nShe's close to being a legal adult.

I guess it will be a good learning experience for her.", "NTA.  Your daughter sucks.", "NTA. You are a father, it is your job to teach your kids. Teaching your children that their actions have very real consequences is part of your job. Your daughter wanted to spite you, so she did. In the process she triggered her mother\u2019s trauma, and dealt you a blow by getting her riled up at you. Unfortunately for your daughter, she is young and doesn\u2019t understand the intricacies of adult relationships. Unfortunately for her she was the one who put the straw on the camel\u2019s back. You should tell her that being spiteful usually ends up biting you in the ass.

I have a mate who for some reason is still with this woman, she just has to hear that he spoke to his child\u2019s mother or sent one text and she goes crazy, she just has to see he\u2019s still friends with an ex on fb and he must be cheating, imagine someone like that hears he cheated from someone who should be a reliable source. \n\nNTA, your daughter is terrible, I imagine this is the start to the end of you and your daughters relationship, I imagine there\u2019s no way out of it where she doesn\u2019t continue to hurt you with lies or where you don\u2019t enable her.", "Oh man, I did not see this coming from the title of your post.  I honestly don't even know where to start with this.  I guess, my first move would be finding a family therapist for you and your daughter.  In no way is accusing your Dad of an affair the typical goto for a teenager to get out of trouble, especially as you and you wife are / were together. So this lie had very little shelf life, and the enormity of it  alone should be sending alarm bells.  \n\nThe fact that there is no history of cheating, combined with no evidence to support cheating, in addition to your daughter admitting to the lie? Speaks volumes.  A solid, happy marriage doesn't crumble from one lie, albeit an ugly one.  Your daughter may have given your wife the excuse needed to bring all this in the open, but she is not the cause of any of this.\n\nI hope you and your daughter get the therapy you both need to heal from this.  I doubt it will be easy, but I hope you put in the effort, and in the meantime, please apologize to your daughter.  While what she said was awful, you are the adult and the role model on how people are supposed to act when they mess up, and how to forgive when they mess up even more.", "NTA \nYour daughter\u2019s behaviour was the trigger that led to family breakdown.

I'm getting angry just at the thought... her lie being the trigger to my marriage being over because of her evilness, sadly, fed into your wife's prior cheating partners experiences.  Yeah, your wife probably got triggered something fierce and can't get the thought out of her head... traumatized by just the thought of \"not this shit again... fucking men\", her walls are in full self-preservation mode and can't see over them.  Your daughter is 100% the trigger of this and I would remind her for the rest of her life.  Every year I'd send her a postcard on the date you officially signed the papers with a clear reminder of what happened.  Petty AF.  I'd go full deadbeat, leave the country and start a life somewhere else.\n\nThis isn't \"kids being kids\", this is life altering event with devastating consequences.

She went full nuclear when that was completely inappropriate.\n\nYes, your marriage was on the rocks, but at least the possibility *existed* that you two could sort it out. Now that possibility is gone, and that is specifically because of Erica's actions. She needs to be held accountable for her actions. She's old enough to be told she fucked up.", "Holy shit even at 14 she should know better nta", "NTA but you could if handled it better. I do think your daughter is plenty old enough to know what her lie caused everyone, that\u2019s it had consequences.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge lie for her to tell just to avoid getting in trouble! She needs some kind of behavior therapy or something. \n\nYour wife refusing to believe you or trust you, after your daughter admitted to the lying, sounds like either she\u2019s cheating or she\u2019s looking for an excuse to get out of the marriage. More so because you gave her access to everything she wanted and she still doesn\u2019t believe you or trust you.", "the truth hurt, she is responsible and telling the truth makes you sometimes the AH.\n\nIf I was you I wouldn't waste time and start new family and new kids, what your daughter did is no different that accusing you of molesting her, she can destroy your life and reputation, and none of it is your fault, sometimes people are just born crazy and sometimes evil.", "NTA.

It sounds like she was upset and seeking comfort.  I think if you wanted to actually let her know how her actions affected things, there are much more appropriate times to do so.

During that trip Erica was hanging out with a few friends after school and got caught by their parents smoking weed. They notified me and obviously I was pretty livid. I was devising my punishment and part of that punishment was her having to explain to her mother about what happened. When she called my wife to tell her instead of saying what she had done she lied and said she came home to another woman at our house.\n\nI think this was an attempt to get out of trouble and has instead created a massive rift between me and my soon to be Emily. Erica did eventually admit to lying about me cheating, but Emily has refused to believe the revision and has zero trust for me now. She has demanded to prove I am not cheating, has looked through my phone multiple times, was looking at my credit card transactions, and even demanded I allow her to track my phone which I refused. After a few weeks of this I changed my passwords to my credit cards and phone and things have been extremely tense ever since. Emily refused to trust me or work on our issues.\n\nLast week, I gave Emily papers for divorce because I am not going to live with someone that refuses to trust me or works on it at all. When we told Erica we were getting a divorce she was notably upset. She said something about it being all her fault and I responded with \"A little bit\". Not my proudest moment and I mostly blame Emily, but Erica started us down this path. Emily called me an asshole and said it is my fault, which I don't under stand, and Erica was even more upset after the comment. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Emily appears to be much more tiggered by Erica's claim than perhaps is normal.

Being cheated on is horrifically painful, and it absolutely can give someone trust issues for life  or at least a very long time. So if I was told by someone I trusted, like my own child, that her dad was cheating.. It's going to take some serious proof and effort for me to be assured that isn't true because infidelity is something that can affect people to their core. \nA teenage girl said a lie that was more damaging than she likely could have imagined. Obviously she knew she was lying and was angry but I dont believe a 14 year old can truly truly understand just how massively damaging a lie like that could be, especially when told to someone who had truly gone through the thing she lied about. \nI can't help but wonder if there's more to this story.
