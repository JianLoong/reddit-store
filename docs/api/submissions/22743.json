He feels entitled to come home from work and not check in regarding household responsibilities.\n\nIf you were home with the baby, he should be checking in with you about your day and the baby\u2019s, and seeing what needs to be done.  Does he need to take the baby so you can make dinner?  Is he making dinner?  Do you both just need to chills for an hour together in the same space?\n\nIf you weren\u2019t home with the baby, he should be calling to check in and see what\u2019s up and if there\u2019s anything he can do to support.  He should also be taking try initiative in household chores.\n\nIn this situation where mom wasn\u2019t there but baby was, he should be taking over baby care and possibly checking in with you to see if there\u2019s anything else \u2014 or take the initiative himself!\n\nIf he can just walk into the house and go game without engaging in responsibilities, he\u2019s just acting entitled."]}
