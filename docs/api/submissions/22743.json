My husband was on the computer a good part of the evening and went to sleep at 12. I got up at 6 when my son woke up. My husband woke up at 7:30 to get ready for work. While in the kitchen prepping my son's breakfast he came up saying he was thinking about taking part of the day off. Me being half awake said that that would be amazing and would give me a break for a bit. He let out a little laugh and said he wanted to play some games. \n\nI looked at him with a death glare. He then chuckled and said he was just joking. I told him he was a piece of shit for making that 'joke'. I'm still only half awake but I keep thinking about it and I get so pissed I hear my blood rushing and get dizzy.\n\nSo aita for taking the joke too seriously? Is my husband being the asshole?\n\nEdit to add info:\n\nMy husband has Asperger's but I've talked to him a lot of times before that he needs to be more active with our son.\n\nThis isn't new behavior for him. He puts the baby off on me all the time. I get that he works and I'm a stay at home mother. \n\nI never really get a break. Not just because of my son but also because we live with his grandmother. I am constantly screamed at by her. When she saw my son's diaper rash she waited till my husband was gone and started screaming that I was a neglectful mother.", "created_utc": 1689866590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154ty14/aita_after_telling_my_husband_his_joke_wasnt_funny/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is he normally this oblivious to your mood/needs?\n\nI ask these not because I think that childcare is a woman's job and you need to 'ask' your husband to help with something that should be both of their responsibilities but because in a comment you mention Aspergers. Having a bit of experience with that, being oblivious of social cues is a big part of Aspergers.", "I was going to go N A H, as it seemed like a little joke, one I would have even done, yet, after reading your comments, it seems that your husband isnt taking care of the baby or you.\n\nYour husband better start acting like a father as well as a partner, give a bath without looking at his phone, take care of diapers, be up all night but not playing videogames. taking care of his baby as he should do.\n\nOp, you are NTA, but talk with your husband because he is being a huge A for not doing something that he should do without a doubt, truly, and sorry to say it, but I hate him, because if I had a child, I would be all over it, taking turns with my future wife in making sure that is okay and not overworking not of us.", "NTA.

With the context, NAH.\n\nYour husband has a bad habit of not supporting you with the kid. I assume he doesn't with his grandmother either. So it makes sense that you didn't find the joke funny. That being said, he probably was trying to lighten the mood, and didn't actually intend to upset you. \n\nBut you're in a bad spot. You're sleep deprived and dealing with an AH granny. When he comes home, leave baby with him and go take a break. Then make it clear you need more support, or you two need to move out (or both).\n\nGood luck.", "NAH.  You're just sleep deprived.", "NTA - but parenting a one year old is so difficult.

I would be less inclined to help someone who talks to me that way and I can't imagine how I would feel if my partner called me a piece of shit. \n\nI'm going to say NTA as long as you initiate an apology for the name calling.  You can explain how you're still upset about the joke because you feel like he isn't pulling his weight with the baby but I would evaluate your reaction.  Being hurt isn't an excuse to give out such a big put down. It seems you are starting to resent him for not helping out and the living situation is making it worse. But being disrespectful to each other and name calling is a bad path to be on. \n\nAlso, being a stay at home mom doesn't give him an excuse not to participate.
