People saying otherwise have clearly never been stalked before. What a breach of trust.", "YTA, but i must be an asshole too, because in the same situation i would do the same thing.", "YTA.  You don't open the door to someone who isn't welcome, especially a roommate's ex who shouldn't be there.   Stop helping your roommate's stalker.", "NTA, but your roommate is a different can of worms.  \n          \nIt is simply humane and responsible to help another, obviously distressed human being who is incapacitated and putting herself in harm's way.   \n           \n\nI don't think your roommate is obligated to date someone she's \"not that into,\" but her callousness toward someone she ostensibly once cared for is alarming.", "NAH. I get the POV of the roommate but it\u2019s extremely dangerous to leave a drunk woman in that state. I can\u2019t imagine how OP would feel had they given the ex the cold shoulder and something happened. That said, it is a concerning situation and the authorities should be contacted if she shows up", "You're a real kind person OP. 8 times in two weeks is a lot of showing up uninvited tho. Has your roommate told her that's not ok?", "NTA because you were concerned for her safety by roommate needs to check into getting a restraining order because you shouldn't have to deal with roommates ex when roommate isn't around.", "NTA. You did what any decent l person would do. It sounds to me like your roommate is TA who just wants any excuse to pawn her problem off to someone.", "NAH\u2026. I would feel so bad if something happen to ex gf.", "Totally understand both sides. As a woman I appreciate that you were cognizant of the dangers of leaving a drunk woman outside alone -- glad you took care of her. But I probably would have sat out on the step with her to wait for the car and not let her inside. I get your roommate's concerns too, I wouldn't want her in my space either. 8 times? That's harassment. If she shows up again, police should be involved. You probably only need to do that once. If you need to do it twice, I personally think your roommate should seek a restraining order.\n\nSo, NTA, but unfortunately your kindness had unintended consequences. Own up to that and make sure you stick to your roommate's wishes going forward.", "YTA. If you're that concerned then wait outside with her. Never let someone into a place where someone who lives there already made it clear they don't want that person there. You're enabling the behavior and endangering your roommate. It's kind of strange you cared more about the ex's safety than your roommates.", "YTA. Obviously that girl is problematic, and you know it and as your friend said, you effectively enable her to keep behaving like that. \n\nShe is a grown woman, if she gets wasted, let her take her of herself.

It\u2019s normal to be devastated, to cry, to try to get back together, to call on the phone\u2026 once it comes to showing up in person things are getting out of hand. Once can be forgiven, MAYBE even twice. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to hope there\u2019s been a miscommunication and that the relationship is salvageable.\n\nBut what\u2019s happening here is pure stalking, not with the intention of gaining clarification from your roommate, but with the intention of wearing her down, exhausting her until the manipulation tactics are able to work. Imagine how hard this is for your roommate and start taking this unstable ex situation more seriously.", "ESH. Only because she was a drunk women n u didn\u2019t leave her for potential worse alot folks are forgetting that apart especially with everyone always being concerned for a drunk women, but also kind of ahole because u probably did help enable her Ex even if the roommate is sort of cold but I would also chew you\u2019re roommate n tell her to deal with it properly and get a restraining order, so she doesn\u2019t keep showing up.", "Nah\n\nYou have a kind heart.

If you let her in again - ywbta.", "NTA, all the people saying you should've dealt with this differently are missing a very important detail: every other time your roommate has waited for it to go away while you've had to to listen to it. Why has your roommate not called the police as the others have insisted you shouldve done. And why does the roommate who has done nothing about this so far have the right to say the next one is now on you? Crazy stuff.", "YTA the cops would have made sure she made it home safe.\n\nNow that's shes knows that she need to just show up drunk that you'll let her in, how else will she now escalate the situation to get her sympathy and attention????

NTA.", "NTA, good on you making sure a drunk person wasn't driving around. You did the right thing.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nAs others have pointed out this is harassment and stalking to come back even once after she was told not to return. \n\nYour roommate should file charges against her to hopefully help keep her away and if not the police can deal with her. It\u2019s important to have a police paper trail so you are taken more seriously if it escalates and it will help her future potential victims. \n\nYou can make amends by going with her to file a police report and being a witness to the unhinged behavior", "YTA\n\nAnd to answer your edit about the ex not having done anything crazy to make your roommate break up with her. \nShe has now. 8 times. And you've just rewarded her intrusive and going on stalking behaviour by letting her in.\n\nPeople who show up at their exes place for more than an hour at a time, crying and refusing to leave, 8 times, are not all there. If I was your roommate I'd worry she's gonna keep it up more now that she got in.", "Yta ,  She keeps showing up just to behave as pitifully as possible and make an unhinged public scene, this same behavior made her appear vulnerable enough to you to justify inviting her in. She's having drunken suffering sessions under the moonlight because she wants your roomate to feel like a bad person whose responsible for damaging her wellbeing and blameable for any unfortunate ripple of events that result. Even though she created the situation which took advantage of your morals, the unnecessary extent of your sympathy disregarded your roomate's sense of trust.\n\nYou could have still called an Uber, yet ensured her safety as a drunk woman at night by waiting _outside with her_ since she has no business entering the home of the person she showed up to harass.

I understand the roommate's irritation, but she's the one that should've dealt with this. Apparently just ignoring it is not helping and it's not up to OP to solve the problem.

You can't just pretend the matter doesn't exist and then be angry with someone who's dealing in their own way.", "NTA Your roommate let this issue fester until you got involved. If your roommate called the cops sooner before it got to the point for you to make a judgement call on someone who clearly needs help. Should you have let them inside?

OP made a quick judgement call to help someone who was clearly in distress. OP is sympathetic let them be.", "YTA\n\nCall the cops on her next time, this is next level Stalker and DVO shit here. And you are complicit.", "NTA.\n\nCalling an Uber for an obviously drunken person at night isn't a bad thing.", "you did what any caring person would do and let her in, it\u2019s a complicated situation but i applaud you bro", "Yta. Your roommate is being harassed by her ex and you just allowed them in? You should have called the police. Now the ex will show up again because you took pity. You're a bad roommate.", "NAH.

But I would honestly go as far as NTA because the roommate has just been playing the \u201cOut of sight out of mind\u201d card. And if the ex is truly dangerous or a stalker in general, then ignoring her is not only bad for her safety, but for OP\u2019s safety as well.
