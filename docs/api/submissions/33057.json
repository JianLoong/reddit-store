She is one of the most passive-aggressive, snarky people you will ever meet. Her middle name is \u2018petty\u2019. The thing that caused our family to keep her at arm\u2019s length, was when she got mad at our mum for accommodating our younger sister\u2019s autism and not force-feeding her as well as allowing her to read at the table (something that calms her down). She got on mum\u2019s arse for \u2018enabling an entitled brat\u2019.\n\nAnother example was when my mum supported Mark\u2019s decision to get the tattoo he had been saving up for, for years. Jane proceeded to call mum up to complain that he made the deposit (with his hard earned, saved money) and had an appointment set. She told mum that was wasn\u2019t going to allow this \u2018emotional incest\u2019 anymore and that she\u2019s happy to make an appointment for all of us for family therapy as this \u2018enmeshment\u2019 is making her uncomfortable.\n\nShe has continued to make comments like these, specifically to mum and it\u2019s disgusting how little respect she has for pretty much everyone but herself. She\u2019s not been invited to Christmas this year but Mark is. It\u2019s unclear what they\u2019re planning to do yet.\n\nA few days ago, Jane called me as mum had blocked her. She said she was 3 months pregnant and went on a long rant about the family dynamic. She then asked \u2018why don\u2019t you all like me?\u2019 I laughed out of pure shock and asked if she was serious. She didn't even respond, just said 'I'll call you when you're in the mood to be more mature.' and hung up.\n\nI told mum about the situation and she's on my side but Mark is fuming at me for laughing at Jane's question and angry at mum for being on my side. Mum just told him that he needs to talk to Jane about her constant comments and insults and she's expecting an apology.\n\nMark won't talk to me and Jane blocked my number.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: The tattoo has got nothing to do with our mum. It's an octopus up his arm that my brother designed himself (he does art and wanted to be a tattoo artist).

She is a nightmare, and now pregnant it will only get worse", "NTA - I get the reaction. It\u2019s been a lot. \n\nThe girl needs to be given an intervention and directly told what she is doing is wrong. You need to prepare a list together with your mom. And your brother needs to attend. Don\u2019t be mean just direct. \u201cWhen you did this, it made me feel that.\u201d \u201cWe will not tolerate in our family x,y,z\u201d.\n\nGoing after your younger autistic sister, I would have flown off the handle. I can\u2019t believe your brother is okay with that. I have high functioning autism myself but didn\u2019t know it until I was 40. But as a kid I had behaviours and my mom always protected me. I was dyslexic and hypo glycemic so my mom just passed off the behaviours as that. I would only eat mayo and cheese sandwiches with carrots and milk for lunch. And my mom defended me against so many \u201cconcerned mothers\u201d. I remember that. It matters. It helped myself worth knowing she wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt me. Your sister knows. She needs to be protected from that nut job. I would shut down any comments she would make around her and be direct. I would also provide her with education on autism. She probably won\u2019t digest but give her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe truth is after all of this, she probably still will be an ass. She doesn\u2019t sound to have any ability to manage her behaviour. She would need therapy. Recommend it but doubt she\u2019d take it. So if she doesn\u2019t change her behaviour high boundaries. And grey rock her. She has already been dangerous to your mom and you. \n\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/grey-rock#alternatives", "\r  \nNTA - It sounds like Jane has consistently shown disrespect to your family, and your laughter was likely a spontaneous reaction to the irony of her asking why no one likes her despite her behavior.", "This is one of those situations where a manipulative person went to therapy... and learned how to better manipulate people.

Answer her question \"why don't you guys like me\" honestly. No accusations, no emotional attacks ...just describe why your family has a problem and name the individual situations. \nExplain what would need to change for a better family dynamic. \n\nBecause it seems like your brother is going to spend the rest of his life with this woman. So you might feel bad about loosing him and never trying to make it work with her.", "Definitely NTA \n\nI wonder if Jane knows that there\u2019s a possibility that the child she\u2019s about to have could also be autistic .. if it\u2019s in the family then it\u2019s likely in the genetics .", "NTA Jane sounds like she is falling for all the anti-MIL stuff she sees online and was looking for \u201cemotional incest\u201d and all the other nonsense because he\u2019s a man who is close with his family. Some women really cannot handle the dynamics with in-laws, some men too of course. \n\nJane sounds like she could be an unsafe person for your sister to be around. Mark has chosen her, so treat her with respect and basic kindness you would show anyone. Keep your sister out of her way.

Good for you for sticking up for your family. Your brother sure isn't. Nice people put up with shit to keep their loved ones happy, let them live their lives and want them to be happy.

The real question here is, why doesn't Mark leave her?\n\nI doubt that she is any nicer to him in private. \nYou haven't done anything wrong. I'd rinse her out for constantly bullying your mum and make sure that brother knows she is not allowed anywhere near your family.", "You don't have a Jane problem, you have a Mark problem.

While it would have been nice to sit down and list all the ways her badgering your poor mother or trying to control your brother's bodily autonomy makes her unlikeable, if you already knew she wouldn't listen... why bother.", "NTA.

But ig if your brother won't talk to you then maybe he likes her behavior? Idk. NTA. It was kinda rude to laugh in her face but also hilarious because she's an asshole. So I don't really feel like you're really in the wrong. If you want you could apologize for laughing at her but then proceed to tell her with words exactly why everyone hates her. Putting it all out there might help things move forward (?) or just make it all fully collapse like it seems like its going to.", "NTA\n\nLet your Brother fume away. It sounds like your laughter was out of incredulous surprise at her question; you may have been wrong to think she was aware of her impact on others, however. Sometimes people don't realize how they come across to those with whom they interact; they're poorly socialized and have no awareness, and therefore show no respect for other peoples feelings. Maybe she'll be able to work it out for herself given time.", "NTA.\n\nOne day your brother will realize how horrible she is. It's just too bad he is having a child with her.", "The real question is why Mark chose such an awful person to make a child with. Seriously, that\u2019s who you need to talk to.\n\nNTA", "NTA I probably wouldn't even have picked up the phone to begin with and cut her off some time ago.\n\nWe have a rude spouse in the family as well, not even nearly as rude as in your case and yet majority of the family cut her off. We have no business in trying to please people like that.", "NTA. Her type of person will never understand or accept that she's the problem, everything will always be someone else's fault. The only question is whether your brother will come to realize that, although it's too late for him to be able to be 100% free of his mistake if and when he comes to his senses, since there's a navy coming. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nJane sounds mean.", "Anybody calls my family member, let alone an autistic kid a brat, they will be literally dragged and kicked out of house.

I don\u2019t think Jane is self aware enough to know why your family doesn\u2019t like her because she should be aware enough to at least know not to say those things about an autistic child or any autistic person.

My family picked up a cousin like this- whole family can\u2019t stand her- the kids she had with my cousin are now a bit of a mess. What we all found out years in was her home life and family upbringing was godawful. Doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior, but I\u2019m guessing Jane has had a pretty shitty family and is likely extremely jealous of yours and wants you all to like her because she wants something normal and functional. She clearly has no idea how to get it. There\u2019s a chance sitting her down and setting boundaries will help, and I\u2019d look at the suggestions around that.", "Perfect ending, why give it more thought", "NTA, but you did miss what was probably your last opportunity to see if she is capable of growth. \n\nOne thing abusers do is try to isolate their partner from family. That way they have fewer people contradicting them, fewer people noticing when something they do isn\u2019t right, and all the attention. This woman is trying to convince your brother that normal familial support is \u201cenmeshment\u201d, and she\u2019s picking fights with everyone in order to go to him with tales of how mean you all are to her. She\u2019s expertly engineering a no-contact situation and you played into her hands.\n\nThere may be no way to convince your brother that he\u2019s in trouble before the iron curtain comes down, because he loves her and will cling to her more than ever if she\u2019s having his child.

I can\u2019t think of a more polite response to her question than simply laughing it off, as you did.", "NTA - Maybe write a list of things she did and said and send a copy to both of them. \n\nTo her: Guess it doesn\u2019t matter if I send this to you or not, because you are you, but you asked and here\u2019s the answer.\n\nTo your brother: And that\u2019s the person you pick and enable to abuse your family. All this shit within a year. You\u2019re in for a long ride.", "NTA \n\nYou're in luck: both your brother and Miss AH are both out of your life. Your family should not back down even if it means not seeing your brother. Her behavior is reprehensible. Make this clear to him, maybe in an email.", "NTA\n\nThat attitude gives me such ptsd from an ex. Nothing she does is wrong, everyone else needs to conform to whatever she says or does.\n\nAs others have said definitely answer her, honestly. Tell her everything she does wrong and dont hold back. She will not like it, and it might end up causing her to explode at you because she cant handle being wrong. But if you still want Mark in your life that is what you need to do. Talk to Mark aswell about it, but not at the same time.

Supporting and accommodating your children and family is usually a healthy dynamic, unless is taken to an extreme, which doesn't seem the case here. I hope you all have a calm discussion with your brother and make him understand how her comments hurt all of you. I hope she is not trying to isolate him from you all.

Sounds like she\u2019s the real \u201cbrat\u201d here. My MIL may feel the need to insert her opinion on how I do things as a mother, but I would never clap back and let her know her 40 something year old son (BIL) who is a massive alcoholic and has no license because of it is probably due to their poor parenting. They chose to punish him rather than understand him and get him help. I can think my thoughts but I don\u2019t need to be an AH and say them.

A lot of people gave you some really good info (even some links!) that is both relevant and provides you, mom, etc a launchpad to proactively move forward. I just want to add a few things, but within the hypothetical context of Jane being a narcissist (I am not a doctor, but others have said it and I agree):\n\n- First, a scoff/laugh pales in comparison to the disrespect she seems to deliver daily. Please don't beat yourself up over that.\n    * I'm also pretty sure she asked you because she assumed you'd\n       beat around the bush, shift blame to other people or placate\n       her. I believe she involved you in an attempt to \"rally\" you to\n       her side as added ammunition in her imagined battles. She\n       never expected you to not only derail her entire plan, but do \n       so in a way that made her feel ignorant for asking. So she \n       belittled you and exited before she could be further humiliated. \n\n- Second, I commend you for even considering mending things with her. It probably won't work, but your willingness to try after everything she's said and done is saintly. Low contact would still be commendable.\n\n-Third... Well there is no third because I cannot understand the sequence of events that took place to allow her to feel confident enough (as an outsider to the family and childless person) to speak so harshly to, and about, two very important people in her boyfriend's life. It wasn't just harsh, it was heartless, ableist and usually a one way express ticket home. \n\n- Lastly, I consider my mother in law a friend. I've been with her son for more than 12 years, she lives on our property and we hang out daily. To say we're candid and comfortable with each other is an understatement; however, I couldn't imagine saying or doing the things Jane has to my mother in law or the people she loves.
