I told her absolutely not, if she wanted dad to go she had to ask someone else to bring him.\n\nShe didn\u2019t like that, and said I couldn\u2019t stop her own father from attending her wedding, and I said he was too sick to go, and that I didn\u2019t want to deal with the hassle. She said that was completely unreasonable, because now it was going to be more of a hassle to find someone to come get him. I said she was going to have to figure it out, or else he wouldn\u2019t be there. She called me a selfish bitch, said I only cared about myself and hung up.\n\nI absolutely do not want to see her at all, along with that I\u2019m not wrong. My dad is in no shape to be in a public gathering, he\u2019ll probably just curse at people or yell racial slurs. I just don\u2019t feel like I should have to go get him dressed and ready, which takes hours, then drop him off, and see the sister I hate, when someone else could do that for me.

He would definitely steal your sister's spotlight, and not in a good way.", "NTA: she literally said it's going to be a hassle to find someone else. Why is that hassle on you? If she rly wanted to \"squash the beef\", then why during the wedding? Not sure how this wedding was planned, but invites usually come wayyyyy in advance of the wedding date. She could have asked you to squash the beef anytime before the wedding. \n\non a side note, she did you a favor. If someone you are about to marry is willing to sleep with your own sister, then good for u to know earlier. Obviously it doesn't make what she did right, but it was probably going to happen with some other person in the future.", "NTA. She's delusional and if she really wants him there, she can arrange for it. I mean...has she even visited HIM since the falling out between you too? The situation is sad, but you aren't TA here.", "A little conflicted, but imo NTA. You didn\u2019t have a little \u201cbeef\u201d, she slept with your fianc\u00e9, and for her to only contact you after four years to get you to do something for her, is disrespectful and selfish. Of course though, this is also her father who has no means of getting there himself, though i\u2019m also inclined to ask whether she ever helped to look after him herself, or even visited him. I\u2019m sure she could arrange a way to get him there without needing to ask you, if she visits him herself.", "NTA. The time and place to put the animosity to rest is not a wedding. Her wedding would be far too emotionally charged for you, given how she took yours from you. Once you told her you weren't going, she treated you as a servant. If she wants your father there then she can hire a home healthcare service to prepare him, drive him, and look after him. That she doesn't understand your feeling about her and weddings and she thinks of you as selfish for not doing her bidding, reintroducing her into your life is going to take a lot of work on her part to show real change.", "Two pieces of information: 1. Is she marrying your ex fianc\u00e9? 2. Has she seen your dad since you became his primary caregiver/since he was diagnosed and if so how often?\n\nEdit ETA: NTA. I was leaning towards maybe if you are not allowing someone else to come and bring him\u2026but if she hasn\u2019t seen him in a year she couldn\u2019t possibly know how well he\u2019s doing. Dementia is rough, and it can go downhill fast. Phone calls just aren\u2019t the same. My stepmom was diagnosed earlier this year. Always fine on phone calls, but when she came for my sons birthday you could tell how bad it\u2019s gotten. I had no idea until I saw her in person. \n\nAs his primary caregiver she has to trust you know best here. I would have said extra NTA if she was marrying your ex fianc\u00e9 btw, because then you\u2019d deserve the right to be extra petty. But sleeping with him is bad enough that no one can be mad at you for not going.", "NTA\n\nBut if your father has been living with you, and you haven't seen your sister in four years, odds are good that your sister hasn't seen your father in four years.\n\nDementia progresses a lot in four years.\n\nThere is no safe way to just \"drop off\" your father at a wedding, without a caretaker who understands his condition and needs. I doubt that your sister realizes what she is asking for.  (An evil part of me laughs at the idea of you doing exactly what she said - take your father there, find her, drop him off in her care, and walk away, and let her deal with the rest.  But it would probably be cruel to your father.)\n\nHowever, your suggestion that she just has someone pick up your dad isn't appropriate either.  It doesn't sound as if there is anyone who would be able to pick up your father and provide appropriate care for him.\n\nIf you've been the exclusive caretaker for your father, and your sister has not come to see him in four years, or done any caretaking, then she has no business trying to make plans for how to have him attended the wedding, because she's completely ignorant of his needs.  And she's got no leg to stand on accusing you of not doing enough for him, when she does nothing.\n\nIt does sound to me as if you need to start making plans for how your father will be cared for when he gets to be too much for you to care for him at home on your own. There is a good chance he'll need a nursing home, or a memory care facility with provisions to keep people from wandering and getting lost.  One person cannot physically provide the supervision needed to keep someone with dementia from wandering off or getting into things in the home and hurting themselves, 24/7.  \n\nGet a care plan, and end-of-life plan, arranged, sooner rather than later.  This is not a stable situation for your father's care.", "Nta. There are respite services that she can pay for him to have support to attend.\nThe whole thing - dressed, fed, toileting, emotional management - she can pay for support like that and you\u2019ll lay out the outfit he can wear. That\u2019s your contribution. Nothing is stopping her from getting him the care he needs for her special day. Seeing as you would have been there had she not slept with your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re not preventing him from attending. You\u2019ve simply told your sister that she needs to figure out the logistics herself. You have a perfectly valid reason for not wanting to attend her wedding, and no reason to put yourself to any trouble to help with her day.", "NTA.\n\nDad's invited, it's sister's responsibility to figure out the logistics of getting him there and back. It's really rich being called a selfish bitch by the person that slept with your fiance.", "NTA. Your father could have a violent reaction to being there with so much going on and so many people he doesn\u2019t recognize.", "NTA.  You're not preventing him from going.  She wants him there, it's on her to figure out.  I don't see her logic, how this would be your responsibility.  It's definitely not.", "NTA\n\nLaugh in her face, that's what I'd do here", "NTA. You\u2019re not stopping you\u2019re father from going you\u2019re just not going to facilitate that and perfectly reasonable in the circumstances that you don\u2019t want to go. The nerve to call you a selfish bitch! She wants to take a look in the mirror when she says that.", "NTA\n\nDementia is no joke!  He would possibly be scared or upset.  You don\u2019t put sick people into those situations.", "NTA. If she wants him there she can hire a day nurse to take him. You are having nothing to do with this. Nothing.", "NTA, but I gotta be honest, if I could find a way to send a senile old man who screams racial slurs at people to your sister's wedding, I would.  I'd send him with a song in my heart.  Hell, I might even be tempted to attend just so I could watch him bring joy and happiness to her special day.", "Don\u2019t answer or acknowledge her - at all! She\u2019s nothing but a selfish person who thinks everything should be her way!  she needs a wake up call and the sooner the better. Stay NO CONTACT with her, she\u2019s toxic!

He requires around the clock care. He is fairly healthy otherwise, but is just not as stable walking and such.\n\nOne thing with dementia people may not understand, is that changes in routine will make them extremely upset and combative at times. And sunsetting can be a huge problem. And crowds only make it worse.

This is a situation that is only going to get more demanding with time.  Plan now, so that as things progress, they can progress smoothly, not by having a crisis hit you. \n\nI've seen people transition smoothly to a more supportive care situation, with family to supervise and visit and be a comfort.  I've also seen people thrown into whatever bed could be found for them when a crisis made family care impossible.  The former is worlds better than the latter.", "There are so many types of care available.  In-home caregivers.  Assistive living.  Memory care units.  Skilled nursing facilities.  All of which can be combined with palliative care and hospice, if appropriate.  \n\nBut it all comes down to planning and knowing alternatives (and funding for alternatives) well in advance.  My father, who died of dementia, had worked out a careful end-of-life plan in advance, before he was even diagnosed, as he knew he was getting older.  Arrangements for guardianship should he be incapacitated, legal power of attorney, medical proxies, lists of what types of care he did and didn't want in different situations.  He also bought long term care insurance, and arranged for his finances to be organized so a spend-down would not be necessary for him to get benefits.\n\nA decent starting point is a form called \"The Five Wishes.\"  [https://www.fivewishes.org/](https://www.fivewishes.org/) It can be made legally binding, in the US, but it is even more useful as a way to start the sorts of difficult conversations that come with loving a person and knowing you may be responsible for their care at some point.", "This eventually did happen. But the in laws where they lived before, weren't part of a health care system with good geriatrics. They listened to the doctor, who said it was normal aging. Long story.
