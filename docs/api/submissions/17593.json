I have savings and an emergency fund, but jobs in my industry are hard to come by right now, so I don't know how long it needs to last. We had already put down most of the money for the wedding when I got laid off but had not yet planned our honeymoon. After a number of hard conversations, we decided that it didn't make sense to spend a big chunk of our savings on a honeymoon when the future was uncertain, and the wedding was already expensive. So we decided to delay our trip until after I had a new job. This was a hard decision for both of us, as we both love traveling and were excited to get to spend time together. \n\nA little extra context: I am a huge nerd and a big Magic The Gathering fan. I have been playing the game for over 10 years, and have amassed a large collection of rare and valuable cards. I have a weekly playgroup with some college friends, and it's one of my favorite parts of my week. My partner plays occasionally but is not as much of a fan as me or my friends. \n\nLast week, my partner decided to come with me to our weekly magic game, which they occasionally like to do. They asked if they could borrow one of my new decks, which I had been showing them the day before. Jokingly, I said \"sure, but be careful! It's worth over $1000\". They looked at me coldly and asked how much my total collection was worth, which I told them was probably around $10,000. They then told me that they no longer wanted to come to the game that night, and seemed kind of pissed off, but I had to leave quickly to be on time, so I didn't hear why. \n\nLater that night, they asked me why I couldn't just sell some magic cards to pay for my part of the honeymoon. I told them that as fun as a honeymoon would be, it would only be a one-time experience, but if I sold my cards I would have to miss out on the weekly games, which are one of the best parts of my week. They called me selfish, and told me that I wasn't prioritizing our relationship like I should. I care a lot about our relationship, I just don't think that it's reasonable to ask me to give up something I love just to pay for a fun trip.

You would be TA if you held onto your collection once you ran out of savings for necessities. But until that time comes, maybe spend time together and consider each others priorities? Maybe a smaller \"budget\" honeymoon can be had so you can still spend time together instead of canceling it all together?", "I read to 10k in magic the gathering cards and my head exploded. Seriously? Are there cards that predict lottery winners? How could cards be worth that much?", "NTA.\n\nTell them you sold all of your cards at a loss and only got $1000. You still need more for the honeymoon. Find their most expensive item and ask them to sell it. See their response. This might actually be an important indicator on the health of this relationship.", "\"If I sold my cards, I would have to miss out on the weekly games\".\n\nSorry, no. You wouldn't necessarily have to sell **all** your cards to pay for the honeymoon, and could still take part with a more limited selection. You're not prioritizing your *friends* over your partner, you are prioritizing your *stuff* over your partner. YTA.", "I think YTA \n\nIn your partner\u2019s eyes you might be prioritizing your valuables/things or friends over your relationship with them. So this would make you the AH for not selecting a portion of your cards to sell. Doesn\u2019t have to be all of them. You make sacrifices for your partner. If your partner wants a special trip that they will always remember with just you, then it would be worth it.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned a new deck. You said you recently lost a job. I don\u2019t know if you bought that deck after the loss of the job, but if so, you are already showing a lack of respect for your partner and poor judgment. Both of these would definitely make me say YTA.", "IMO If you're still playing with magic cards you shouldn't get married yet.", "NTA. As long as you aren't out there actively buying new expensive cards, you shouldn't have to sell your cards to pay for a one time trip. If you were drafting every week or buying fresh decks every month I'd say relax and just use your existing cards, but that is literally what you're already doing.", "NTA\n\nwhat expensive \u201chobby\u201d do they spend money on? Makeup? Clothes? Shoes? Maybe they should sell some of their stuff to pay for the honeymoon if they\u2019re  so insistent on it. \n\nI\u2019d honestly pause the wedding prep right now OP, your fianc\u00e9e is showing you who they are right now, and it\u2019s someone who puts their selfish wants over anything. Honeymoons are NOT essential, especially when money is tight.\n\nEdit genders.", "Honeymoons and weddings are overrated. You make few unimportand memories and a debt for a lifetime.", "NTA It's not worth permanently getting rid of your cars for the temporary joy of a honeymoon.", "NTA, this sounds like a collection you gathered over a long timespan, to sell it for something like a honeymoon doesn't make any sense. They should take into account how much it means to you, instead of getting upset with you and so casually mentioning that you should have sold it on your own initiative. You shouldn't be punished for spending money on things you can keep, if you'd spent that money on something consumable instead, you wouldn't have the option to sell that right now, either.\n\nIf this were about something else, more of an emergency situation, I could see an argument for their point of view, but for something like this, nope.", "NTA. Perhaps you could trim your collection down to core staples and whatever main decks you play, but the best part about growing a large collection is having the pieces later down the road when new decks, strats, and combos are figured out.   \n\n\nIt will be especially painful if you sell off any pieces like Reserved List and Duals. I'd personally hold on to as many of those as long as I can, along with sentimental pieces.  \n\n\nYou need to talk to your partner about why these things are more important to you then a trip, and how you're viewing this situation. Getting back into a stable position is much more important than doing the honeymoon immediately. I'm doing mine soon after over a year delay, and we'd delay it even further if we had to. You need to get on the same page, especially if you're in the process of merging finances.   \n\n\nAlso just because your deck is $1k doesn't mean you're going to get that from it, and how much effort it takes to liquidate a collection. It's not like you can go to a store and go \"Here are my Mana Crypts and Moxen, now give me downpayment for a house please!\" Your partner might not have much of an idea about the inherent value of the cards and what your collection means to you, nor what it takes to rebuild one after you've lost it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso look into insurance, if your collection is getting that pricey a flood or fire will fuck it forever.", "NTA. No one she be expected to sell off a collection they value to pay for a trip. If it was life-saving surgery, sure, but vacations should be planned for whenever it is financially feasible.", "NTA it\u2019s something that is important to you and they want you to sell it? That isn\u2019t a great way to start your marriage. Sit them down and talk about this again, they are being very selfish.", "OPs partner is Non binary fyi. Their pronoun is them!", "Yeah that's right, they will still contribute their share, though it's a little more complicated because we are starting to merge our finances more in advance of the wedding.", "NB", "OP's partner doesn't appear to be offering to sell an equivalent amount of their own belongings.", "What a terrible take First of all, the expensive cards likely make up some of OPs core decks. Even if they're just in the collection it is his hobby that he's allowed to have. Lastly he isn't prioritizing friends over his partner. Shame on you for saying that. He's prioritizing his hobby/stress relief/ happiness over a one time trip that can be taken later when he has a job again.", "Why an expensive wedding and honeymoon when your out of work?\n\nMarriage is a lifetime commitment.  So a plan for more long term needs should take priority. \n\nAlso if material things are more important than a spouse or child ever, something is seriously off the rails.\nESH", "Sorry that's maybe unclear. The new deck is mostly made up of cards I already own, I spent no more than like $50 getting new cards for it, I just mostly put together things I had in different decks.", "make sure to keep your cards safe!!", "Wat", "> My partner (27NB) of three years and I (29M)\n\n\"Girlfriend\" is not a term you'd use to describe a NB partner.", "Lol I swear it was F some mins ago?"]}
