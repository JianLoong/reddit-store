I have savings and an emergency fund, but jobs in my industry are hard to come by right now, so I don't know how long it needs to last. We had already put down most of the money for the wedding when I got laid off but had not yet planned our honeymoon. After a number of hard conversations, we decided that it didn't make sense to spend a big chunk of our savings on a honeymoon when the future was uncertain, and the wedding was already expensive. So we decided to delay our trip until after I had a new job. This was a hard decision for both of us, as we both love traveling and were excited to get to spend time together. \n\nA little extra context: I am a huge nerd and a big Magic The Gathering fan. I have been playing the game for over 10 years, and have amassed a large collection of rare and valuable cards. I have a weekly playgroup with some college friends, and it's one of my favorite parts of my week. My partner plays occasionally but is not as much of a fan as me or my friends. \n\nLast week, my partner decided to come with me to our weekly magic game, which they occasionally like to do. They asked if they could borrow one of my new decks, which I had been showing them the day before. Jokingly, I said \"sure, but be careful! It's worth over $1000\". They looked at me coldly and asked how much my total collection was worth, which I told them was probably around $10,000. They then told me that they no longer wanted to come to the game that night, and seemed kind of pissed off, but I had to leave quickly to be on time, so I didn't hear why. \n\nLater that night, they asked me why I couldn't just sell some magic cards to pay for my part of the honeymoon. I told them that as fun as a honeymoon would be, it would only be a one-time experience, but if I sold my cards I would have to miss out on the weekly games, which are one of the best parts of my week. They called me selfish, and told me that I wasn't prioritizing our relationship like I should. I care a lot about our relationship, I just don't think that it's reasonable to ask me to give up something I love just to pay for a fun trip.

You would be TA if you held onto your collection once you ran out of savings for necessities. But until that time comes, maybe spend time together and consider each others priorities? Maybe a smaller \"budget\" honeymoon can be had so you can still spend time together instead of canceling it all together?", "I read to 10k in magic the gathering cards and my head exploded. Seriously? Are there cards that predict lottery winners? How could cards be worth that much?", "NTA.\n\nTell them you sold all of your cards at a loss and only got $1000. You still need more for the honeymoon. Find their most expensive item and ask them to sell it. See their response. This might actually be an important indicator on the health of this relationship.", "\"If I sold my cards, I would have to miss out on the weekly games\".\n\nSorry, no. You wouldn't necessarily have to sell **all** your cards to pay for the honeymoon, and could still take part with a more limited selection. You're not prioritizing your *friends* over your partner, you are prioritizing your *stuff* over your partner. YTA.", "I think YTA \n\nIn your partner\u2019s eyes you might be prioritizing your valuables/things or friends over your relationship with them. So this would make you the AH for not selecting a portion of your cards to sell. Doesn\u2019t have to be all of them. You make sacrifices for your partner. If your partner wants a special trip that they will always remember with just you, then it would be worth it.\n\n~~Additionally, you mentioned a new deck. You said you recently lost a job. I don\u2019t know if you bought that deck after the loss of the job, but if so, you are already showing a lack of respect for your partner and poor judgment. Both of these would definitely make me say YTA.~~\n\nEdit: new info from OP", "IMO If you're still playing with magic cards you shouldn't get married yet.", "NTA. As long as you aren't out there actively buying new expensive cards, you shouldn't have to sell your cards to pay for a one time trip.

Makeup? Clothes? Shoes? Maybe they should sell some of their stuff to pay for the honeymoon if they\u2019re  so insistent on it. \n\nI\u2019d honestly pause the wedding prep right now OP, your fianc\u00e9e is showing you who they are right now, and it\u2019s someone who puts their selfish wants over anything.

You make few unimportand memories and a debt for a lifetime.", "NTA It's not worth permanently getting rid of your cars for the temporary joy of a honeymoon.", "NTA, this sounds like a collection you gathered over a long timespan, to sell it for something like a honeymoon doesn't make any sense. They should take into account how much it means to you, instead of getting upset with you and so casually mentioning that you should have sold it on your own initiative. You shouldn't be punished for spending money on things you can keep, if you'd spent that money on something consumable instead, you wouldn't have the option to sell that right now, either.\n\nIf this were about something else, more of an emergency situation, I could see an argument for their point of view, but for something like this, nope.", "NTA. Perhaps you could trim your collection down to core staples and whatever main decks you play, but the best part about growing a large collection is having the pieces later down the road when new decks, strats, and combos are figured out.   \n\n\nIt will be especially painful if you sell off any pieces like Reserved List and Duals. I'd personally hold on to as many of those as long as I can, along with sentimental pieces.  \n\n\nYou need to talk to your partner about why these things are more important to you then a trip, and how you're viewing this situation. Getting back into a stable position is much more important than doing the honeymoon immediately. I'm doing mine soon after over a year delay, and we'd delay it even further if we had to. You need to get on the same page, especially if you're in the process of merging finances.   \n\n\nAlso just because your deck is $1k doesn't mean you're going to get that from it, and how much effort it takes to liquidate a collection. It's not like you can go to a store and go \"Here are my Mana Crypts and Moxen, now give me downpayment for a house please!\" Your partner might not have much of an idea about the inherent value of the cards and what your collection means to you, nor what it takes to rebuild one after you've lost it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso look into insurance, if your collection is getting that pricey a flood or fire will fuck it forever.", "NTA.

Not happening.", "NTA \n\nBut sounds like you two need to have a very serious talk about expectations.  Perhaps moving the wedding date until you're both financially stable?

I'd never get rid of something valuable for a one time expense unless I was dying.", "Not the asshole. \"They\" sound like an asshole.", "Weirdly I'm gonna go with NAH.  From what I've seen magic collections turn into a last ditch savings account.  You don't sell them as they're illiquid, and you don't get full value.  Generally 50-75% depending on time put into selling.  But you do sell them before going into CC debt or losing home etc.  This is more of a communication error than anything else.

If you were still buying cards in this situation then I could totally understand their frustration and anger after agreeing there was no money for a honeymoon.

Same with your partner feeling resentment for missing an immediate honeymoon.\n\nI do not know anything about Magic the Gathering but it sounds like getting rid of your cards would mean missing something you love and look forward to each week and you deserve that as well.

I mean, his decks aren't worth $10k, but it's over $2k. \n\nI think this is actually a red flag tbh. Your partner doesn't have to be a huge MTG nerd but it's still a massively disrespectful ask, even pushing them into asshole territory themself to insist and then be pissy about it.

I do have a couple of ideas that I think are reasonable though since I already had a wedding \ud83d\ude09 But firstly, do not cave in to any guilt tripping. Anyone who is trying to get you to do something you don't want to do, at the expense of your feelings, is participating in an abusive behavior. Try to excuse yourself and don't take anything they say to heart. \n\n\nAnyway. The ideas: Buy or make a big honeymoon box and set it in an area at your wedding that everyone will see. If you hired a bartender, you can place the box near that area unless of course you allowed them to collect tips. Lots of fun and alcohol is a good way to entice guests to add some money to you box. \n\nSecond way is the money dance. I'm Hispanic so we have a money dance at our weddings but I'm unsure if it's common among other nationalities. My husband is white and never heard of it but its fun and the guests get to dance with both of you. It's a great way to spend time with guests you haven't had a chance to spend time with yet. \n\nI know you said you both had some hard conversations about the honeymoon already but I think it means more to her than you might understand. You can always sit down for another conversation and promise her a honeymoon on a specific date as like a promise. Or go on a more reasonably priced honeymoon with a budget. Money from your wedding guests would help if you are open to the ideas i suggested. \n\nJust don't compromise on your magic cards. Maybe I'm just projecting but I would definitely hold some resentment if I was pressured to sell my cards for a honeymoon, and lose something I enjoy every week.", "NTA. Don\u2019t sell your cards. It sounds like your fianc\u00e9e has half the money for a honeymoon. Use that and spend less on your honeymoon.  It doesn\u2019t need to be a big destination to be special. Tell your partner you will fund another vacation later when you can afford it. \n\nMake sure they understand how long and difficult it was for you to acquire your decks.

Not a great combination all at once.\n\nYour financial situation right now is temporary. You will find a new job. You will replenish the bank account. You will be able to take that honeymoon. It just may be a bit later than originally planned.\n\nDemanding you sell your stuff, which is a permanent action, is actually kind of an irresponsible thing to do anyway. It's like people who pawn their jewelry to buy a TV instead of saving up for a few months. And the fact that this is a super important hobby to you makes it even worse. I would never ask my partner to sell off things important to them in order to pay for something that can be deferred until you have the money otherwise.\n\nThis would be different if you were running the risk of not being able to cover your mortgage/rent/car payment and were on the brink of losing your home or your car. That'd be a more reasonable moment to talk about selling the cards.\n\nThere's one red-ish flag in your story for me though that maybe needs some discussion with your partner: Paying for \"your part\" of the honeymoon. You're about to be married, and it's not really \"your\" money vs \"their\" money at that point. \n\nAnd you might want to reflect on your own wording. You close out with \"just a fun trip\" which comes across as dismissive of the importance of the trip.
