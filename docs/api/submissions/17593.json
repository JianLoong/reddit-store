I have savings and an emergency fund, but jobs in my industry are hard to come by right now, so I don't know how long it needs to last. We had already put down most of the money for the wedding when I got laid off but had not yet planned our honeymoon. After a number of hard conversations, we decided that it didn't make sense to spend a big chunk of our savings on a honeymoon when the future was uncertain, and the wedding was already expensive. So we decided to delay our trip until after I had a new job. This was a hard decision for both of us, as we both love traveling and were excited to get to spend time together. \n\nA little extra context: I am a huge nerd and a big Magic The Gathering fan. I have been playing the game for over 10 years, and have amassed a large collection of rare and valuable cards. I have a weekly playgroup with some college friends, and it's one of my favorite parts of my week. My partner plays occasionally but is not as much of a fan as me or my friends. \n\nLast week, my partner decided to come with me to our weekly magic game, which they occasionally like to do. They asked if they could borrow one of my new decks, which I had been showing them the day before. Jokingly, I said \"sure, but be careful! It's worth over $1000\". They looked at me coldly and asked how much my total collection was worth, which I told them was probably around $10,000. They then told me that they no longer wanted to come to the game that night, and seemed kind of pissed off, but I had to leave quickly to be on time, so I didn't hear why. \n\nLater that night, they asked me why I couldn't just sell some magic cards to pay for my part of the honeymoon. I told them that as fun as a honeymoon would be, it would only be a one-time experience, but if I sold my cards I would have to miss out on the weekly games, which are one of the best parts of my week. They called me selfish, and told me that I wasn't prioritizing our relationship like I should.

You would be TA if you held onto your collection once you ran out of savings for necessities. But until that time comes, maybe spend time together and consider each others priorities? Maybe a smaller \"budget\" honeymoon can be had so you can still spend time together instead of canceling it all together?", "I read to 10k in magic the gathering cards and my head exploded. Seriously? Are there cards that predict lottery winners? How could cards be worth that much?", "NTA.\n\nTell them you sold all of your cards at a loss and only got $1000. You still need more for the honeymoon. Find their most expensive item and ask them to sell it. See their response. This might actually be an important indicator on the health of this relationship.", "\"If I sold my cards, I would have to miss out on the weekly games\".\n\nSorry, no. You wouldn't necessarily have to sell **all** your cards to pay for the honeymoon, and could still take part with a more limited selection. You're not prioritizing your *friends* over your partner, you are prioritizing your *stuff* over your partner. YTA.", "I think YTA \n\nIn your partner\u2019s eyes you might be prioritizing your valuables/things or friends over your relationship with them. So this would make you the AH for not selecting a portion of your cards to sell. Doesn\u2019t have to be all of them. You make sacrifices for your partner. If your partner wants a special trip that they will always remember with just you, then it would be worth it.\n\n~~Additionally, you mentioned a new deck. You said you recently lost a job. I don\u2019t know if you bought that deck after the loss of the job, but if so, you are already showing a lack of respect for your partner and poor judgment. Both of these would definitely make me say YTA.~~\n\nEdit: new info from OP", "IMO If you're still playing with magic cards you shouldn't get married yet.", "NTA. As long as you aren't out there actively buying new expensive cards, you shouldn't have to sell your cards to pay for a one time trip.

Makeup? Clothes? Shoes? Maybe they should sell some of their stuff to pay for the honeymoon if they\u2019re  so insistent on it. \n\nI\u2019d honestly pause the wedding prep right now OP, your fianc\u00e9e is showing you who they are right now, and it\u2019s someone who puts their selfish wants over anything.

You make few unimportand memories and a debt for a lifetime.", "NTA It's not worth permanently getting rid of your cars for the temporary joy of a honeymoon.", "NTA, this sounds like a collection you gathered over a long timespan, to sell it for something like a honeymoon doesn't make any sense. They should take into account how much it means to you, instead of getting upset with you and so casually mentioning that you should have sold it on your own initiative. You shouldn't be punished for spending money on things you can keep, if you'd spent that money on something consumable instead, you wouldn't have the option to sell that right now, either.\n\nIf this were about something else, more of an emergency situation, I could see an argument for their point of view, but for something like this, nope.", "NTA. Perhaps you could trim your collection down to core staples and whatever main decks you play, but the best part about growing a large collection is having the pieces later down the road when new decks, strats, and combos are figured out.   \n\n\nIt will be especially painful if you sell off any pieces like Reserved List and Duals. I'd personally hold on to as many of those as long as I can, along with sentimental pieces.  \n\n\nYou need to talk to your partner about why these things are more important to you then a trip, and how you're viewing this situation. Getting back into a stable position is much more important than doing the honeymoon immediately. I'm doing mine soon after over a year delay, and we'd delay it even further if we had to. You need to get on the same page, especially if you're in the process of merging finances.   \n\n\nAlso just because your deck is $1k doesn't mean you're going to get that from it, and how much effort it takes to liquidate a collection. It's not like you can go to a store and go \"Here are my Mana Crypts and Moxen, now give me downpayment for a house please!\" Your partner might not have much of an idea about the inherent value of the cards and what your collection means to you, nor what it takes to rebuild one after you've lost it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso look into insurance, if your collection is getting that pricey a flood or fire will fuck it forever.", "NTA.

Even if they're just in the collection it is his hobby that he's allowed to have. Lastly he isn't prioritizing friends over his partner. Shame on you for saying that. He's prioritizing his hobby/stress relief/ happiness over a one time trip that can be taken later when he has a job again.", "Why an expensive wedding and honeymoon when your out of work?\n\nMarriage is a lifetime commitment.

Not happening.", "NTA \n\nBut sounds like you two need to have a very serious talk about expectations.  Perhaps moving the wedding date until you're both financially stable?

From what I've seen magic collections turn into a last ditch savings account.  You don't sell them as they're illiquid, and you don't get full value.  Generally 50-75% depending on time put into selling.  But you do sell them before going into CC debt or losing home etc.  This is more of a communication error than anything else.

If you were still buying cards in this situation then I could totally understand their frustration and anger after agreeing there was no money for a honeymoon. But absolutely you should not have to sell something you cherish and collect to pay for an experience. Especially when this is something you still use and enjoy.

Same with your partner feeling resentment for missing an immediate honeymoon.\n\nI do not know anything about Magic the Gathering but it sounds like getting rid of your cards would mean missing something you love and look forward to each week and you deserve that as well.

I mean, his decks aren't worth $10k, but it's over $2k. \n\nI think this is actually a red flag tbh. Your partner doesn't have to be a huge MTG nerd but it's still a massively disrespectful ask, even pushing them into asshole territory themself to insist and then be pissy about it.

And also selling magic cards is a pain in the fucking ass and the big stores will try to pay as little as possible and most smaller stores only pay store credit for singles", "> you are the only reason there's no honeymoon?\n\nThe layoff is the reason. Really shouldn't blame people for being laid off.", "\"wife\" is incorrect OP's partner is non binary.", "*not wife, OP\u2019s partner is non-binary", "Why'd you put \"they\" instead of just they?", "Oh, sweet summer child\u2026you have no idea. Google prices for \u201cBlack Lotus\u201d and \u201cPower Nine.\u201d\n\nEven if most cards aren\u2019t quite *that* expensive, there are plenty that are worth hundreds of dollars each, and those add up when you\u2019re building a good deck.", "He\u2019s not prioritizing his stuff over his partner, he\u2019s prioritizing his ongoing mental health and beloved hobby over a vacation.", "This is where I am on this. You can sell some cards. When you get another job buy more cards. Surely OP isn\u2019t using the entire deck. This is akin to having a fleet of bikes or dirt bikes and being unwilling to sell one or two to manage a temporary situation without spending savings. \n\nIf the all of the cards are more important than a honeymoon then you better plan to never hear the end of it from in-laws, friends of your fianc\u00e9 or other members of the peanut gallery. This isn\u2019t to say you need to go on the honeymoon of your dreams. But some recognition that you have the means to do something special after the wedding is important.", "I mean by the same thought process, fianc\u00e9e is prioritizing a trip over their future partners day to day happiness. This is something they are actively playing weekly. What happens when they return from the trip? Do they repurchase all their cards? Or is it a \u201coh your cards are gone so you may as well just give it up forever!\u201d type deal? \n\nI would absolutely say to sell them in an emergency, a honeymoon is in no ways an emergency.. it\u2019s not even something that\u2019s technically a necessity to have at all", "What kind of attitude is this? Adults can have hobbies! Would your attitude be the same if they were playing poker or euchre? If not your a hypocrite. It\u2019s a card game.", "Just celebrated my 15 year wedding anniversary, I\u2019ll tell my husband to sell his cards and see if it goes any better than OPs partners attempt lmao", "Not if you\u2019re already living on savings", "Or regular bills. He's been laid off for months, he can suck it up and work at McDonald's\n\nIt's not the honeymoon, its that he's unemployed, and sitting on 5 figures. Is he doing the chores now? Is she supposed to cover all the bills when his savings run out?", "Good argument, but OP\u2019s partner is non binary was referred to with they/them pronouns", "I agree that the honeymoon isn\u2019t a necessity they should sell their cards for.\n\nAlso OP partner is non-binary, not a girl.", "I would think any married couple in the face of a true emergency would sell things of value to survive regardless of whose item it is. I don\u2019t think selling the cards is fair for a honeymoon, but if they were on the verge of eviction or bankruptcy then yes it would make sense.", "Not an emergency, a vacation.  He has to sell stuff so they can go on a vacation at the time his partner wants to. That's wild.", "Are they supporting you financially at the moment? You haven't found a job in your industry yet, but are you working/looking for temporary work to tide you over in the meantime?", "Rethink merging finances.", "Because I did \ud83e\udd37", "OP's partner is working. It's good these conversations came up before marriage, because if large amounts are still being spent on a hobby while unemployed, then that's important information to know about your partner before marriage. \n\nPersonally, I think waiting and having an anniversary trip would be a better choice than doing a honeymoon when finances are uncertain, but I can see how someone would get surprised to find out you have a $10,000 hobby sitting there, when money is tight. I spend less than $50 a year on my hobbies, and OP just called spending $50 on a new deck \"not much\"", "Ok, thanks for clarifying. This would definitely make me walk back my second paragraph. I still think there\u2019s room for both of you to communicate further on this issue and come to a compromise.", "And lives.", ">I spend less than $50 a year on my hobbies\n\nThat HIGHLY depends on the hobby. I'm a hobby Baker. I OBVIOUSLY spend more than 50 a year. Almond flour alone cost 12 dollars and it's only a few cups. \n\nI also play the drums. My set isnt expensive but cost a couple thousand while some can cost MUCH more. But adding peices and new pedals, replacement sticks can be expensive. \n\nI also play videogames. 1 game I just bought last week cost me 70 dollars. Is that the only game I get for the year? No. I have another one coming out next month and ANOTHER one the following month. \n\nI also go to the gym  that's 12 bucks a month and that's a cheap membership. \n\nNo I'm not rich. I make 41k a year. No I dont still live with my parents. But I am child free and have been with my partner for 7 years. But I wouldnt sell my drum set to pay for a week long vacation. That's divorce worthy words lmao. Just push the vacation."]}
