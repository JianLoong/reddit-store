I would never deliberately leave my belongings at someone's house without their express permission. I would be very annoyed if someone left their things at my house, especially something like a used swimsuit.", "NTA\n\nDon't bother inviting these 'friends' over any more, they are just using you as a free leisure centre and diner. They aren't respecting the house rules or your feelings.", "NTA. Make it clear to them that you\u2019re not responsible for stuff they choose to leave behind. Donate everything to charity.", "NTA\n\nYour friends should take their belongings with them. Doesn't matter if they only use their swimsuits at your house or not.", "NTA. You aren't their second home.\n\nPut these things away somewhere and tell them you don't know where it is when they go looking for it. Enough things go missing, they'll stop leaving their stuff. When you go to visit them, bring their stuff with you and sneakily put it in the bathroom or something.", "NTA and I wouldn't call it a \"pet peeve\". It's perfectly reasonable to not want someone to use your place to store their stuff.", "NTA You don't have to have a damn dresser drawer for friends' random items of clothing. Who does that? \"Hey, I intend you to ask me over to your pool again, so I'm tasking you with watching my pool things.\" I'd be binning those. An accident here or there? Understandable, but if I accidently left an item at someone's house I'd be calling to see if it was found and making arrangements to get it and definitely NOT forgetting stuff regularly. Charge them rent for every item they leave. It is taking up space in your house. You are not a self storage unit.", "I mean, I think it's a little dramatic to say leaving a bathing suit at someone's house is \"gross and unsanitary\", and one or two additional towels in the load is not much \"free laundering. \n\nBut it is super weird that someone is complaining about their hosts not being *more* generous.", "And how is op childish but demanding you get your own way in someone elses home because you're lazy is super mature adult shit?", "It is not childish. Op is their host not storage unit. It is basic.", "Not that I\u2019m aware of. I recognize it\u2019s normal for some people to leave their belongings at their friends homes. I just really dislike having random clutter and wet swimsuits sitting on my floor/shower door respectively", "Lol. Put Everything in a box of lost and found. Take a pic. Share with your friends saying it's going on the pavement in a week or so. \n\n\nNTA.", "I've left things like board games at people's houses before if it's someone that regularly hosts events, but when I do it's more like a donation than a storage, and I fully communicate to the person that it's a gift.", "Who is it?  I agree with you if \"they\" is plural nebulous group of people but if you meant my mom, adult child or best friend  I would probably disagree.", "Lol you\u2019ve inadvertently become \u201ctheir family cabin at the lake\u201d", "Wait, so they were leaving their wet / recently worn bathing suits at your place after having gone swimming? \n\nDid they expect you to wash, dry, and store them for them to use when they get back???", "Don\u2019t throw away! Donate to charity!", "Me too! If I leave drinks somewhere I don\u2019t expect them to be there when I come back.", "I think this is the official drink left behind policy at a host\u2019s house", "Pool owner - many friends with pools - it\u2019s always bring your own towels - if we need to give some out no biggie - also everyone brings food and drinks to share", "Oh so you say the problem is you \"only use the (x item) *here*\" \n\nWell I solve that one quickly, you won't be using it *here* any longer. \ud83e\udd23\n\n\nHow they don't see this as the inevitable response of pushing this I will never know.\n\nNTA", "If I was a regular visitor to your home and pool I'd have a spare swimsuit and towel in a bag in my car.      \nI'd use it at yours, take it home to wash, and put it back in my car for next time.       \nI live by the beach, I've always got a bag of swimwear and towels in my car for impromptu after work/school beach trips so that'd be my solution.", "That makes sense because that could potentially be a lot of towels!", "Weirdo cos I don't like you leaving your shit in my house? Since you aren't the weirdo, take your shit home. \n\nWhy do I have to be stepping around your jacket, drink, bathing suit and stuff? Some day you will call me to debate if I saw so or so?
