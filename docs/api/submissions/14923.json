I also have an issue with this. My house has enough clutter for me to have to keep up with their stuff, too. NTA, everybody needs to keep their own stuff at there own residence.", "While i can accept your decision on many items....\n\nWhy not leave board games at your house if you only meet at your place?  and as a decent host IMHO (and in our gaming group) we either provide drinks or store what people bring over.", "NTA\n\nSend a group email to everyone in this friend group and explain this pet peeve of yours and that they don\u2019t have to like it, it is what it is. Give them X number of days to pick up their stuff and if they don\u2019t they won\u2019t be invited back.", "Unopened drinks are fair game for becoming open drinks and being all drank up before their next visit.  Board games are fair game for being loaned out to other friends or family, donated to Goodwill, etc.  I'd put my foot down about clothes.  You're not a clothes storage depot.", "Idk why they can\u2019t leave these things in their car since they said they only use them at your place. Sounds like this person also does not want clutter around and has pawned his off on you.", "Ugh no. It takes up too much headspace to keep track of other people's things!", "That\u2019s a lot to leave behind. And for you to be responsible for keep track. I\u2019d just say that can\u2019t keep track of it all so you have a policy that you can\u2019t store. If someone \u201cforgets\u201d call them to pick it up.", "So cheeky and entitled, I understand you not wanting random things at your house because if something happens to them, you'll be blamed or I just wouldn't want things at my house anyway ..its not hard for them to take them home, I don't get why they're being awkward about a reasonable request NTA", "Start throwing their things away. I mean, warn them first, but tell them that anything left at your home after they drive away goes straight into the garbage. You\u2019re not their personal storage unit. You have a right to keep a tidy home. Why would you hang onto random things that you didn\u2019t buy and won\u2019t use? That sounds like trash to me!", "respectfully that is not how those laws work", "I don\u2019t think the action in itself is inherently disrespectful- I have a hot tub & have accumulated enough swim suits from close friends that they have a now have a basket in my closet & it doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest. \n\nHOWEVER, this \u201cfriend\u201d should\u2019ve been able to tell that they were encroaching on your boundaries the first or second instance. Feeling entitled to inconvenience you is an embarrassingly ignorant act on their part. I would pick your favourite suggestion here & tell that obnoxious friend of yours to get stuffed. The audacity.", "That is an ex-friend. Tell them they're an asshole for saying that, and don't invite them back.", "Wet swimsuits on your floor/shower door!?!?? Oh hell no. That\u2019s not a pet peeve. That\u2019s downright rude! OP, I think others surmising these friends are trying to encroach and feel like your place is theirs - ESPECIALLY since you mentioned they live with parents - is spot on. Keep setting your boundaries. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll encroach more and more until you blow. And the friendship will be over.", "Yeah,  I thought that was an almost universal unwritten rule.  If I bring a six pack and only four are drunk, then the rest are for the host.", "Yup. If someone leaves an unopened drink at my place then it is now my drink and it will be drunk. Open drinks left behind get trashed.", "That is the rule at our house if someone uses our pool. You leave your drinks, they are ours now.", "Drop their clothes off at the nearest goodwill.", "I live at the beach.  I deliberately keep extra beach towels on  hand for guests, too.  I've only needed them a few times, but I just like being able to provide them.", "It sounds like they're using OP's towels and then leaving them there for OP to launder. Nice.", "I am using they as a plural, it\u2019s one main individual and another who\u2019s not near as bad, but often \u201cforgets\u201d despite many reminders.", "But I left monopoly, 3 white claws, and my wet swim shorts here, so it's kinda like it's my house too. Right?", "Is it really more irrational that the OP rightfully does not want people to leave stuff in his house, or that the \"friend\" is so entitled that they would rather cause this issue repeatedly than to comply with this reasonable request from OP?", "Absolutely, when I bring drinks to a home, they stay there!", "Maybe place their wet items together with whatever else they left in a tight plastic bag as a convenience for them to remember. The swim suit will get moldy and the other items may be ruined but you were just trying to be helpful.", "I imagine they use your towels, too... you're gonna wash those anyway so you may as well wash his bathing suit.  \"Not a big deal,\" for him, he just shows up, puts on a clean suit and grabs a clean towel. Or if he doesn't expect you to wash his suit does he just wear it (stink and all) and get in your clean pool?  Oh heck no.\n\nI hope you put a stop to this.  Definitely NTA.", "Suggest that they\u2019ll leave it in their car, so that they don\u2019t forget to bring it and don\u2019t clutter up your home with their dirty laundry", "I wouldn't throw it away because it's so extreme, but a storage bin called lost and found wouldn't be bad. But put EVERYTHING in there. Wet bathing suits, beer , you name it. If it gets damaged in the bin it's a part of being left there. Keep it in the basement or somewhere out of the way.", "Yep, we were the \"pool house\" when I was in my 20's. I had a bin that was overflowing with people's stuff (bathing suits, towels, t-shirts, sunscreen, etc.). I'd leave it for the season. If it was still there when we opened the pool for the new season, it got donated or dumped as appropriate. I'm not a storage bin and I'm not in the business of chasing adults down to return their things to them.\n\nThat said, no one person ever came back looking for stuff I'd already donated or dumped, so they obviously didn't miss it!", "It's not ALWAYS like that ... it's how YOU handle it.", "Exactly. \u201cWell it sounds like you need to start using them somewhere else\u201d", "Plus having to wash and dry all those towels!"]}
