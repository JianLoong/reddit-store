If you don't, well then... proceed as you are.\n\nI do agree that people should be buying things the host will drink - my friend has a hot tub and when we go use it, we bring cider or seltzer since she's gluten free.", "But a damp swimming suit left in a bin to become unusable is an object lesson in taking care of one's own belongings.", "NTA. Warn them that anything left behind and not collected within 3 days (little leeway for those who did so accidentally) will be donated to charity. Repeat offenders will have their items donated the following day.", "If  they think you\u2019re such an AH why on earth do they want to be at your house in your company using your pool?  NTA.", "NTA it\u2019s actually a pet peeve of mine to leave any of my stuff behind and I always worry about forgetting things. I like having all my things with me so I know where they are. Maybe if you were a family member it wouldn\u2019t be as odd to leave something of mine there but you could just keep it in my car no? Maybe just me", "Anyone who called me a asshole in my home.....probably wouldn't be invited back.", "Get a lost and found bin with a lid. Start chucking it all in there. I hate when people put shit on my tool cart while I'm working . Sometimes I put it back sometimes ill leave it on the floor. Sometimes I'll hide it.", "NTA.  IANAL, but you might check with one.  Some jurisdictions will assume when you allow people to leave their stuff in your home that you have granted them some sort of tenancy, like when they have their mail sent to your home it is assumed they live there. \n\nPersonally, I happen to agree with your 'pet peeve'.  Today it's a swimsuit, next month it's a box of old books or clothes, then their old recliner is in your garage or basement, then it's a bedroom set and next damn thing you know you can't use half your home because of their crap.  When this started happening at my house, I put a large box by the door and made sure to tell everyone that anything they left would be donated or trashed by the end of the week.  Only had to make the donation trip twice before everyone got the message.", "I like the lost and found bin idea. Before everyone leaves, round up wet bathing suits and put them in the dryer oh high heat for an hour. If anyone says \"oh, just let them drip dry!\" tell them \"no, because it'll make everything else in the lost and found bin mildewy for the next person that wants to use that bathing suit. Oh, you don't want anyone else to use that bathing suit? Then take it Home. With. You. NOW.\"", "Hmmm, can\u2019t say it\u2019s nasty or gross, that a little bit ridiculous (to me). But I will say, take you stuff home because I will not be responsible for your stuff.", "This whole thread is so wild to me, if I asked my friend to keep a bathing suit around for me to use when I come over I know for a fact that they would be absolutely cool with it. I legitimately don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s in any way unsanitary or gross, it\u2019s literally a swim suit??? \nI will happily take it home to wash periodically but y\u2019all talking as if it\u2019s going to poison this guys entire wardrobe. YTA for sure for not being accommodating to your friends, and I\u2019m fully in awe of people who disagree", "Your house is not a storage facility and other people\u2019s stuff takes up space. It probably wouldn\u2019t be a big a deal if it\u2019s something you also use but that is rare.\n\nEveryone around you prob knows this about you by now but if not, you give them one warning that you\u2019re not responsible for anything that gets lost. No retort if they refute. Stop with the arguments, simply toss it and claim ignorance. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the stuff, it\u2019s a disrespect to your boundaries. Like you\u2019re hosting plus you have to take care of their stuff. I don\u2019t think so.\n\nNTA", "You asked a friend to take their bathing suit home and they called you \"childish\" and an AH?!  Seriously?!\n\nThey're not your friend.\n\nNTA", "That's exactly what I would do, as well. Swing by the store and grab some drinks on the way over (drinks to share) and you're all set.", "Having lived in a party house and then lived with someone who used to host parties all the time, it's really not weird to not want people to leave stuff at your home. This is even grosser because it's uncleaned used swimsuits being left around on the floor and shower door (not OP's responsibility!!).\n\nTo think you're owed space in someone else's home because you go there often, weird and entitled.", "Throw everything left behind in the dryer for an hour or two. Yes, I know bathing suits should not go in the dryer. Do it anyway.", "NTA.\n\nPut up a sign that reads: \"You leave your personal items here; I'll sell to put in my personal savings.\"", "Petty part of me says throw their stuff away.", "Put the damp or wet stuff into a plastic bag and let it get moldy it until the next time.", "Hey friend, thanks for leaving your stuff behind. I\u2019ll be calling my REAL friends at 1-800-GOT-JU&K tomorrow.", "NTA they sound too comfortable treating your home like their own and the boundaries are getting fuzzy. \n\nSending everything home and extending the time between invitations may help", "NTA but this person is too comfortable and you may benefit from distance", "NTA. Say \u201cokay, I\u2019ll just add it to the guest pile\u201d\n\nSide note: make sure to keep an outdoor box full of junk that is notoriously disgusting known as the \u201cguest pile\u201d and make sure they see it next time they come over. Play dumb when they comment on the cleanliness.", "NTA  But their frequent visits would become not so frequent or stop entirely if it were me.", "NTA. The only places I leave stuff are stuff I forgot at a friends house or something, which I get back at our next meeting or I pick it up next time I visit, and at my boyfriends flat, where I'm allowed to leave stuff. If you don't want your friends to leave stuff at your place then they should pick up after themselves!! They shouldn't be leaving stuff at your place on purpose.", "Frankly If they leave it throw it away and tell them exactly that, that is what you will do no matter how much it cost them in the 1st place let alone to replace it. Your home is not their storage shed/closet. NTA", "NTA it's not their house and it sounds like they don't respect you or your home enough to be invited over anymore.", "I\u2019m tempted too sometimes", "They left drinks and candy at your house, so, you appropriately used them.\n\nAnd they felt that you needed an intervention for this?\n\nYour friends are weird. In your place, I would have just told them that if they feel so unwelcome, they're free to not return. Moreover, did they even ask your permission to leave things behind, expecting you to keep them for them?\n\nIncidentally, while it's quite appropriate to bring something when you're invited, whether it's flowers, food, wine, etc. But that is considered a host/hostess gift. Meaning, it belongs to you. So your friends are not only weird, they're completely in the wrong.", "Start charging him a daily storage fee.", "Make it an obvious, Oscar-the-Grouch style metal trash can, too! Just so nobody misses the intent. :)", "They are leaving abandoned property at your place and expecting you to deal with it, and indeed calling YOU an asshole for NOT dealing with this thing they foisted on you? This is what we call a Bad Friend. \n\nStop inviting them over. Text them that they have three days to come and get their stuff before you pitch it in the trash.", "Having a dedicated drawer or bag in a closet for the occasional guest to keep things, especially when they are frequent guests, does not make your home a storage unit. Like I said, once someone says no then the guest should move on.", "Sorry, OP never said they lived in a \"party house\" . They mentioned a swimming suit, which could have very easily been stored in a bag at the back of a closet somewhere. At no point did they say people just left stuff on their floor. It was only a matter of not taking it home. To me, you seem to either be inventing a lot of circumstance, or OP has since left additional information that was left out of the original post. Still, I can not seem to care. It's a bathing suit ffs, lol. I've been told I'm anal about stuff, but even I wouldn't care enough to risk a friendship over storing something that takes up the space of a toilet roll.", "Might be the route I take going forward. It\u2019s frustrating to say the least!", "How weird.\n\nThis is basically what your friend is saying:\n\n\"Hey - nice of you to host us all for the 70th time! We really appreciate your letting us use the sweet hot tub and have a good time while we live rent free in our parents house (and yours, tbh!). Too bad that it's always you who has to tidy up your place before we get together and clean it when we leave. \n\nOh, hey, by the way, you know that one simple thing I won't do that makes this super sweet deal you're offering us grate on your mind so much that you have to ask internet strangers if there's something wrong with you? Yeah, I can't be bothered to lift a finger to accomodate that because it's a mild inconvenience to me. Gotta go, enjoy the cleaning and extra laundry! By the way, you are an asshole for even mentioning that you might not want me to store my clothes here. But thanks for the steaks! Next time a bit more on the rare side of medium rare, though.\"\n\nNTA.", "I very much appreciate that the other parents had solidarity in this and were backing your dad. Excellent village parenting!", "You\u2019ve described the situation pretty close to perfect. My wife and I are the ones who clean up their cans and wrappers from things they eat. They leave it all over our house. Our other friends have no issues cleaning up their mess. Just this one individual for reasons I cannot begin to understand. Then they play it off as oh sorry I\u2019ll grab that. Totally forgot for the 1,000th time", "Maybe ask your other friends if they would be bummed if this person was no longer informed of the gatherings. Its entirely possible you are all thinking they are an important person to include and tolerate because everyone else thinks so, when actually it's not the best.\n\nDon't have to be gossipy about it \"x is really bothering me and it isn't changing. I'm thinking of no longer inviting them. How would you feel about that? Can you think of other solutions? I don't want to cause issues, but I'm feeling really disrespected.\"", "Maybe it's because I've been storing stuff for my friends in my tiny apartment for about two years (three? Not sure) now (I suspect they've forgotten it's here), and I still manage to live a full and rich life despite this horrible intrusion, lol.\n\nWe choose what matters to us. I find that for me, things like this matter extremely little. That might make me weird, but I'm pretty sure I'm a lot happier for it. Storing a bathing suit? Ffs if that's your biggest issue with your friend, you are absolute golden."]}
