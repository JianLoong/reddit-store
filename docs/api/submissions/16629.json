Besides that it felt like an extremely personal question, I was never abused luckily but many people have. Either way, when it is my turn I obviously say \u201adead\u2018 bc humor is my coping mechanism and my parents are, indeed, dead. The teacher laughed at first (the suprised \u201aholy shit what did he say?!\u2018 kind of laugh\u2018 and immediately tried to move on lol I do feel a bit bad for putting him on the spot like that but like\u2026 should have thought things through, we\u2018re studying sociology after all lol\n\nAfter class out of nowhere this girl in my class comes up to us and she is ANGRY.

This is hilarious to me bc while she definitely saw me with my adoptive parents, they are asian, I am half black and half white lol I explain they adopted me after parents died and she goes off about how I should honor them and their \u201asacrifice\u2018 and how she hates seeing ungrateful people like me just toss their adoptive parents aside. In the moment I told her to fuck off and just left but I feel I handled it extremely poorly.\n\nI have since learned that she is adopted and that\u2018s probably why she was so angry. I also think it was unwise of me to make that joke in class.

Like they asked me to describe my dead parents, who I barely remember. What else am I supposed to say?

You\u2019re not the issue, all these helicopter guardians ensuring their charges never feel a moment of discomfort are the issue.

In the moment I didn\u2018t think much of it since it fit the topic we were discussing (generational trauma and racial differences between families and so on) but the longer I think about it the worse it gets? Like the whole point was to show that white kids tend to view their parents as friends while kids of color see them as authorities but tbh the answers didn\u2018t reflect that? Either way I\u2018m thinking about writing a complaint with some other students about this since people who have dif teachers for the same class said they never did an exercise like this", "> NTA. The whole purpose of university is to expand your mind.\n\nIt used to be, and still is in STEM subject.

Fine if you volunteer that info but to ask everyone - and to ask everyone with the expectation of drawing a line down a racial divide - is really poor on that lecturer's part. \n\nEven if it fits the topic the same exercise could be done anonymously, e.g. using an anonymous text-in service or just putting it on paper and having people write white/ strict, Asian/ loving etc would achieve the same without asking people to share trauma or grief they don't want to in a public forum.", "Past had issues too.

People don't get to tell you how to talk about your own experiences.", "I do not think your response in class was inappropriate; it was simply honest.  As to the other student, you might tell her you are happy she had a good adoption, but she should never assume everyone has a similar past.  NTA.", "NTA.\n\nFeelings aren't facts. \n\nYou were asked to describe your parents in one word. You did. The parents you opted to describe were your biological parents, rather than your adoptive (and therefore, presumably, legal) parents.\n\nYou made the snap decision in class to describe your parents as \"dead\" rather than \"adoptive,\" which is fine. It honored/ acknowledged your biological parents in a way that was true to you. \n\nThe classmate who got upset has a similar yet different background. She also had biological and adoptive parents. When faced with that same snap decision, she opted to describe her adoptive parents in some way that \"honored\" them and was true to her. \n\nThat classmate felt upset you chose to honour your biological parents instead of your adoptive parents. Feelings aren't facts and can't be universally applied. She is entitled to her feelings and you are entitled to yours. Neither of you are right and neither of you are wrong. Feelings simply are. Where one becomes an AH is when one expects others to deal with their feelings exactly like them: for example, your classmate values that her adoptive parents raised her, and thinks you should feel the same toward your adoptive parents. That is where her feelings cross from valid (for her) to being an AH (to you).\n\nThe other issue was that you said out loud that your parents are dead in a group of young people. Some classmates had uncomfortable feelings about that, which they're blaming you for. It's not your fault. \n\n You're probably already familiar with this phenomenon and don't need it explained to you. My mom died when I was 23, so societal discomfort around death was a bit of a revelation to me. People would say things like, \"How did she die?\" and it took me YEARS to realize they were following some sort of mental/ social script that they hadn't thought through to the end of, and they didn't actually want to follow. No- one wants the answer to that question. It doesn't matter how she died. They don't know what to say to the fact she's dead. Death is now rare enough in society that the act of telling someone that you've lost a close loved one to death sends them into a self- conscious spiral of panic because they have no idea how to respond or what to say -- AND it brings up the innate death fear.  \n\nAnyway, people panic around death and blame the person who uses the word for their big feels. It's stupid. People still die. They just die less frequently than they did 100 or 50 years ago.", "NTA. Super sick of the narrative that kids should be *grateful* that someone \"gave\" them the bare minimum.", "Speaking as someone who's mum died when she was young I think your response was pretty fucking funny.

So hard NTA on your side OP.", "Our daughters were adopted from third world country. Middle school science assignment genetics fill out information about parents.

Daughter tried to explain, teacher told her all adopted children have access to their records and information. Would not listen. Next day my child out paper with adopted parents information, zero. I went to the principal and told him I was going to school board if he didn\u2019t correct the teacher. Called teacher in for conference and teacher still argued we should have been able to get information overnight\u2026. From third world country, when information not in records.  Teacher was sanctioned and assignment was changed to accommodate adopted, foster and children in guardianship situation.  Still pisses me off remember it.", "NTA, but for my own personal reasons that I feel are similar. Our oldest son died by suicide in 2016. When making conversation with new people they often ask how many children I have. I always answer honestly, but then come their follow up questions of ages, boy/girl, etc. I LOVE talking about my children, but I understand death, and especially suicide, are harsh topics, so I try to keep my details vague. Occasionally I meet those people who just don't get the hint and I've had to be blunt. I don't like saying \"Oh my son took his life so he's dead\" or some other awful thing, but what else is a person supposed to do when put on the spot like that?
