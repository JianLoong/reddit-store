While I am grateful to them, neither of us ever felt part of their family and there was a clear distinction in how they treated us vs their bio kids. Therefore I do not consider them my parents, I do call them that when talking about them but only because \u201athe couple that raised me\u2018 is a bit of a mouthful.\n\nI started uni recently, Sociology. The teacher asked us all to describe our parents in one word and tbh, this is on him, he should have said \u201aparents/legal guardians\u2018 or smth bc I\u2018m sure I\u2018m not the only orphan he\u2018s ever taught. Besides that it felt like an extremely personal question, I was never abused luckily but many people have. Either way, when it is my turn I obviously say \u201adead\u2018 bc humor is my coping mechanism and my parents are, indeed, dead. The teacher laughed at first (the suprised \u201aholy shit what did he say?!\u2018 kind of laugh\u2018 and immediately tried to move on lol I do feel a bit bad for putting him on the spot like that but like\u2026 should have thought things through, we\u2018re studying sociology after all lol\n\nAfter class out of nowhere this girl in my class comes up to us and she is ANGRY. She starts having a go at me, telling me how rude and inconsiderate my comment was and that I shouldn\u2018t lie bc she saw me with my parents in town. This is hilarious to me bc while she definitely saw me with my adoptive parents, they are asian, I am half black and half white lol I explain they adopted me after parents died and she goes off about how I should honor them and their \u201asacrifice\u2018 and how she hates seeing ungrateful people like me just toss their adoptive parents aside. In the moment I told her to fuck off and just left but I feel I handled it extremely poorly.\n\nI have since learned that she is adopted and that\u2018s probably why she was so angry. I also think it was unwise of me to make that joke in class. I was even emailed by the teacher who said that \u201asome students\u2018 complained about my \u201ainappropriate comment\u2018, however I also feel this is a bit ridiculous? Like they asked me to describe my dead parents, who I barely remember. What else am I supposed to say? Some people from that class have also messaged me, either saying I was being an asshole or saying they think I was in the right and that the teacher should have never did that exercise in the first place.\n\nI\u2018m quite conflicted, so am I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1683474527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13au93g/aita_for_joking_about_being_an_orphan_in_class/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn\u2019t get to dictate how you refer to your family, nor does anyone else. Also, wtf is wrong with her that she just comes up to a random person to harass them about their family situation?", "NTA. That's a disastrous question to ask a whole class to answer publicly. Entirely on the lecturer, who is TA in this case. Could have upset you, actually did upset some other people - but your comment isn't the problem. That's a really loaded question for a lot of people.", "NTA. The whole purpose of university is to expand your mind. I\u2019m guessing most students haven\u2019t dealt with the loss that you have, but it doesn\u2019t have to be sugarcoated for their comfort- especially in a sociology class. \n\nYour classmate was out of line.

He got what he asked for.", "NTA. We need to get past the notion that all kids are being raised in a two parent, heterosexual household. Every family looks different. Also, I probably would have busted out laughing at your response because I use dark humor all the time.", "NTA. What would your prof have done if someone had answered abusive or neglectful or addicts? Because plenty of kids grew up with parents like that. Dead was the least triggering response someone could have given about a traumatizing childhood. Don\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want honest answers to.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong, that question was stupid in the first place and you answered it the way you wanted, and you have all the right to do it", "NTA, everyone's experience is different, and it really seems like she has a strange complex about this.", "NTA. You are spot on- the teacher hopefully learned a lesson about assuming everyone has an intact birth family. And the other students who had feels about you being orphaned? Not your problem.", "NTA - If making dark jokes helps, do it. You\u2019ll also be able to find others who are in to the same kind of humor!\n\nShe is also NTA I think, I can empathize that it may strike a cord with people who have had bad times.", "NTA, it\u2019s your issue, sorry if she has the same problem but to expect to dictate your feelings is incredibly entitled.", "NTA. That question, I am sure the teacher realized as soon as you answered, was not wise. You were truthful and not dramatic. As you did not ask the girl for her opinion and she knows nothing about your family situation, her comments are unwelcome.", "NTA. Teachers have been aware of this issue for a long time and your teacher should have been prepared for not everyone having the same family life. When I was in highschool, it was a family tree project that caused problems.", "NTA\n\n**Adoption is not an act of charity.**\n\nSorry to bold that at you since you are adopted and know it better than me, but this sub is notorious for an absolutely shocking attitude to adoption and what adoptive parents are \"owed\" from their children.\n\nAdopted people do not owe their parents for raising them. No children do. Be it a bio, adopted, foster, step or other type of relationship. They chose to be parents and therefore owe it to you to raise you.\n\nYou do not owe them gratitude, loyalty or love because they followed through on their obligation to feed and shelter you after making the decision to adopt you.\n\nIt's very sad to hear that there are adopted people out there who do feel they have to give their parents those things, rather than being allowed the choice to give them if it feels right.", "NTA\n\nIf classmates take offense with your answer, they should direct themselves to the person who asked the question.\n\nYou answered truthfully, nothing wrong with that.\n\nAlso, why should these people feel insulted with your truthful answer? They seem pretty privileged with their family life and entitled. Well, they're welcome to the real world...", "NTA - You know what sucks, when people project their experiences onto other people, and believe bc one part of their story is similar, all parts of their stories must be the same. Parent/child relationships are vast and varied, whether they be adopted or biological.

Maybe it\u2019s an inappropriate question, thanks for bringing up such a painful subject.\n\n\nUgh I\u2019m so sorry.  This is totally on the teacher and not you.

That girl needs to mind her business.", "NTA - The teacher should never have asked such an insensitive question.

Asking people about their parents is so loaded. Some people have really terrible parents.\n\nThe student who confronted you? She was way out of line. Firstly, it sounds like you might not even know her. Plenty of people have extended family who are definitely NOT their parents and will visit them at school and sort of doing parental stuff but aren't the parents. Her being adopted doesn't excuse her poor behavior and making your life about her beliefs.\n\nYou have a right to consider the people who adopted you your parents or not.", "NTA, it\u2019s obvious she was the only one who had an issue with this.

That\u2019s not your job, and she needs lay her personal shit out to a professional instead of you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not the issue, all these helicopter guardians ensuring their charges never feel a moment of discomfort are the issue. They have created an overly sensitive society that doesn\u2019t know how to deal with uncomfortable topics and demands that everyone else tiptoe on eggshells so as not to inadvertently \u201ctrigger\u201d the emotionally unstable train wrecks they\u2019re releasing on us.", "NTA\n\nYou ARE an orphan.", "NTA. If the teacher keeps pushing, ask them why they asked such an inappropriate question. They were \"lucky\" worst answer was dead. It could have been abusive, neglectful or absent. S/he set themselves up for answers that would be honest but inappropriate as an ice-breaker as distressing to both person speaking and those listening.\n\nYou gave an honest answer. It is sad it triggered your classmate but she needs to realise her reality isn't everyone else's. Your guardians aren't parents if they differentiate between you and bio-children. She and your teacher don't get to police your relationships.", "I\u2018m glad some people agree bc this started a whole discussion in the group chat and most people said stuff like \u201awe\u2018re studying sociology what did you expect\u2018 or that \u201athese are difficult topics we need to discuss\u2018 and kinda supported the teacher and acted like the kids who got triggered were to blame. In the moment I didn\u2018t think much of it since it fit the topic we were discussing (generational trauma and racial differences between families and so on) but the longer I think about it the worse it gets? Like the whole point was to show that white kids tend to view their parents as friends while kids of color see them as authorities but tbh the answers didn\u2018t reflect that? Either way I\u2018m thinking about writing a complaint with some other students about this since people who have dif teachers for the same class said they never did an exercise like this", "> NTA. The whole purpose of university is to expand your mind.\n\nIt used to be, and still is in STEM subject. In social sciences it's a place for angry know-it all teenagers to demand that their lecturers agree with everything they believe.", "I've done some university teaching (UK and different subject) but making students give up ANY personal information in a public setting about their family lives would be seriously frowned upon. Fine if you volunteer that info but to ask everyone - and to ask everyone with the expectation of drawing a line down a racial divide - is really poor on that lecturer's part. \n\nEven if it fits the topic the same exercise could be done anonymously, e.g. using an anonymous text-in service or just putting it on paper and having people write white/ strict, Asian/ loving etc would achieve the same without asking people to share trauma or grief they don't want to in a public forum.", "Past had issues too. Did mixed degree where on social studies side you only got a decent mark if your essays agreed with your lecturer's thoughts on subject. Independent thought frowned on. Pendulum swings about a lot depending on subject and professor but always has. STEM can be easier as often objective facts.", "The weirdest part is that this course is psrt of my research and methodology course, this is actually all part of our final survey we\u2018ll make on this exact topic and we talked about confidentiality and shit the lesson before and then throw it out the window in the next?
