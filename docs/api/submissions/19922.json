{"id": 19922, "submission_id": "14bzhgk", "title": "AITA for yelling at my wife's brother for smoking at a party?", "selftext": "(Names changed for privacy)\n\nHi, I (25M) have been married to my wife Lisa (24F) for 2 years now. Our families are pretty close with each other and we're extremely tight-knit. Lisa has two siblings, an older brother David (28) and a much younger sister Katie, who just turned 12. I also have an older brother, we'll call him John (29.) My brother John and my wife's brother David are also close with each other.\n\nA few days ago, Katie had her 12th birthday party. All of us were there, me and Lisa, David, John and his wife and my nephew. Also, there were some aunts, uncles, and cousins, and some of Katie's Grade 7 classmates and friends were there as well.\n\nIt's an outdoor party, and we're all just chilling out and having fun. All of us were there while Katie was blowing out her candles and cutting the cake. We all sang her Happy Birthday.After cutting the cake and getting food and all, Katie and her friends and cousins are just playing games, me and the other adults are talking in chairs. Until I noticed David left to go inside the house. I thought nothing of it, I figured he was just going to use the bathroom.\n\nAfter a while, I started to get suspicious and I went inside to look for David. I saw him inside, smoking. I knew he was a smoker, but I was still obviously weirded out as this was his child sister's birthday party and that he shouldn't be smoking here. He told me that he was being quick and that he wasn't outside near the other kids and adults, or my wife Lisa who has asthma. I told him that this was not the time nor place and that he should grow up. He got angry at me, which caused us to start yelling at each other.\n\nThe other adults, including some of the aunts and uncles, Lisa, and John started to pour in. The kids were even confused as they were just watergunning each other down and heard adults yelling inside.My brother John jumped in to defend David telling me that it was none of my business what he did, and I told him it is my business because it's a child's birthday, and his own little sister at that. At that point, we're all yelling and nobody understands what anybody is saying.\n\nAfter the screaming match, we just passive aggressively and awkwardly carried on with the party, and the atmosphere was off. Even Katie and the other kids noticed. By the end of it, we all just went home awkwardly, not knowing what to do.\n\nNow David isn't answering any of my calls, and while John is trying his best to fix things, he still thinks I'm the AH for getting in David's business. My wife says I was in the right to yell at him.So, AITA?\n\nEdit, More Info: It was at their parents' place, and they've expressed to me and my wife they hate the smell of smoke, but haven't communicated shit with him yet because they're bad at communication.", "created_utc": 1687030094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bzhgk/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wifes_brother_for_smoking/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I burst through the door!  He stood, fully exposing himself to me.  And at a child's birthday party!  Small children only down the hall, around two corners, out the back door, and across the lawn.

Even if they did, that's is not even close to a reason to ruin child's birthday.", "Except noone was in the vicinity, which is exactly why he was smoking there. Everyone was in the garden so rather than smoking around them he did it somewhere else. David is allowed to smoke in the house by his parents, it isnt OPs house or business.", "STA, still the asshole.", "And who made you the smoke police?", "Except it wasn\u2019t your house either so it wasn\u2019t your business. They invited you as a guest, not a resident and not as their property security guard.", "Sorry, my mistake. Do their parents allow smoking in their house?", "The dunce award goes to\u2026.", "EHS, he sucks for smoking in a non smokers house. \n\nYou suck because you got mad at him for the wrong reasons. There's nothing wrong with taking a quick break from a social event. You could have told him off for smoking inside.\n\nPoor kids bday was ruined by adult drama that didn't need to escalate into a shouting match.\n\nEdit: I realize you did say something to them for smoking. Everyone still sucks though.", "Yes he couldn\u2019t have smoke indoors literally no one was indoor when he smoke. It\u2019s not a  lot confusing to me it\u2019s still not Op business because it\u2019s not his house", "Cool down. Parents can voice for themselves. You speak like he was injecting cyanure in the wine.", "ESH based on the added information. He was right to separate himself from the party to smoke, but shouldn't have done so indoors without permission. But it's not your house and not your place to start a party-wrecking argument about it.", "Well, that makes it more likely that you were TA.\n\nIts not your house, so over the top outrage is not for you to express.\n\nBut, this sounds more like you delivered a social reminder that in the confusion of kids and people coming in and all got blown into an ongoing communal conflict.\n\nI'm going to have to go with a NAH, except for David.", "Yep and probably thought he\u2019d be thanked \ud83d\ude44", "You're right, I'm sorry, I misread! It was hard to figure out whose house it was. Apparently it was neither OP's nor David's.", "They haven't outright stated anything and even throughout the screaming they were acting as mediators, but they don't exactly feel the best about it. They're terrible communicators though so i doubt they'll ever tell their son to fuck off.", "i\u2019ve edited my comment to recognise it wasn\u2019t op\u2019s house and op has edited the post!", "Who made you their spokesperson?", "The homeowners haven\u2019t said anything to their son, but you, decided to insert yourself as an authority, try to exercise authority over their son, and created a scene at their daughter\u2019s birthday? \n\nAnd you somehow think the son is the one who needs to fuck off?!?", "Youre the one that needs to fuck off mate. Not your house, not your decision. Screaming at another man because he happens to smoke is just ridiculous, grow up.", "I'm going to stick with you being sightly more in the wrong since it wasn't your place, but this just sounds like a huge mess and I do have sympathy. Smoke is awful :("]}
