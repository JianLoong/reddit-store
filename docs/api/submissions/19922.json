Our families are pretty close with each other and we're extremely tight-knit. Lisa has two siblings, an older brother David (28) and a much younger sister Katie, who just turned 12. I also have an older brother, we'll call him John (29.) My brother John and my wife's brother David are also close with each other.\n\nA few days ago, Katie had her 12th birthday party. All of us were there, me and Lisa, David, John and his wife and my nephew. Also, there were some aunts, uncles, and cousins, and some of Katie's Grade 7 classmates and friends were there as well.\n\nIt's an outdoor party, and we're all just chilling out and having fun. All of us were there while Katie was blowing out her candles and cutting the cake. We all sang her Happy Birthday.After cutting the cake and getting food and all, Katie and her friends and cousins are just playing games, me and the other adults are talking in chairs. Until I noticed David left to go inside the house. I thought nothing of it, I figured he was just going to use the bathroom.\n\nAfter a while, I started to get suspicious and I went inside to look for David. I saw him inside, smoking. I knew he was a smoker, but I was still obviously weirded out as this was his child sister's birthday party and that he shouldn't be smoking here. He told me that he was being quick and that he wasn't outside near the other kids and adults, or my wife Lisa who has asthma. I told him that this was not the time nor place and that he should grow up. He got angry at me, which caused us to start yelling at each other.\n\nThe other adults, including some of the aunts and uncles, Lisa, and John started to pour in. The kids were even confused as they were just watergunning each other down and heard adults yelling inside.My brother John jumped in to defend David telling me that it was none of my business what he did, and I told him it is my business because it's a child's birthday, and his own little sister at that. At that point, we're all yelling and nobody understands what anybody is saying.\n\nAfter the screaming match, we just passive aggressively and awkwardly carried on with the party, and the atmosphere was off. Even Katie and the other kids noticed. By the end of it, we all just went home awkwardly, not knowing what to do.\n\nNow David isn't answering any of my calls, and while John is trying his best to fix things, he still thinks I'm the AH for getting in David's business. My wife says I was in the right to yell at him.So, AITA?\n\nEdit, More Info: It was at their parents' place, and they've expressed to me and my wife they hate the smell of smoke, but haven't communicated shit with him yet because they're bad at communication.", "created_utc": 1687030094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bzhgk/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wifes_brother_for_smoking/", "score": 452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
