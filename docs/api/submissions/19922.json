Our families are pretty close with each other and we're extremely tight-knit. Lisa has two siblings, an older brother David (28) and a much younger sister Katie, who just turned 12. I also have an older brother, we'll call him John (29.) My brother John and my wife's brother David are also close with each other.\n\nA few days ago, Katie had her 12th birthday party. All of us were there, me and Lisa, David, John and his wife and my nephew. Also, there were some aunts, uncles, and cousins, and some of Katie's Grade 7 classmates and friends were there as well.\n\nIt's an outdoor party, and we're all just chilling out and having fun. All of us were there while Katie was blowing out her candles and cutting the cake. We all sang her Happy Birthday.After cutting the cake and getting food and all, Katie and her friends and cousins are just playing games, me and the other adults are talking in chairs. Until I noticed David left to go inside the house. I thought nothing of it, I figured he was just going to use the bathroom.\n\nAfter a while, I started to get suspicious and I went inside to look for David. I saw him inside, smoking. I knew he was a smoker, but I was still obviously weirded out as this was his child sister's birthday party and that he shouldn't be smoking here. He told me that he was being quick and that he wasn't outside near the other kids and adults, or my wife Lisa who has asthma. I told him that this was not the time nor place and that he should grow up. He got angry at me, which caused us to start yelling at each other.\n\nThe other adults, including some of the aunts and uncles, Lisa, and John started to pour in. The kids were even confused as they were just watergunning each other down and heard adults yelling inside.My brother John jumped in to defend David telling me that it was none of my business what he did, and I told him it is my business because it's a child's birthday, and his own little sister at that. At that point, we're all yelling and nobody understands what anybody is saying.\n\nAfter the screaming match, we just passive aggressively and awkwardly carried on with the party, and the atmosphere was off. Even Katie and the other kids noticed. By the end of it, we all just went home awkwardly, not knowing what to do.\n\nNow David isn't answering any of my calls, and while John is trying his best to fix things, he still thinks I'm the AH for getting in David's business. My wife says I was in the right to yell at him.So, AITA?\n\nEdit, More Info: It was at their parents' place, and they've expressed to me and my wife they hate the smell of smoke, but haven't communicated shit with him yet because they're bad at communication.", "created_utc": 1687030094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bzhgk/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wifes_brother_for_smoking/", "score": 2170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And who cares if it\u2019s a child\u2019s birthday party, if he wants to smoke he can.", "YTA\n\nBut I'm not sure you understand why given your edit. It makes me think you're seeing the posts and it hasn't quite sunk in yet as to *why* YTA, and I want to explain why if you'll let me. I'm sure you're a decent fellow.\n\nI think I can understand where you are coming from. You felt like David should be more present at his sister's party, and because you know his parents don't like the smell of smoke and have difficulties communicating this to David, you took it upon yourself to handle this. You wanted to do the right thing.\n\nHere are the issues:\n\n* David's absence wasn't noticed by Katie. Like you said, all the kids were having a water gun fight. You said he was gone for a while. Was it really a long time? As in more than an hour? Most kids won't think anything of someone leaving for a period of time. An hour is like the bare minimum for them to be gone so long for it to be offensive. If we're talking like a half hour, I'm going to be honest, Katie would probably assume he was taking a dump.\n* ***\"I knew he was a smoker, but I was still obviously weirded out as this was his child sister's birthday party and that he shouldn't be smoking here.***\" You shouldn't have been. This is an odd reaction. I don't think you understand what happens when you are a smoker. When you have a dependency on tobacco, it is really uncomfortable to go without, and can make you incredibly irritable. People really don't just not smoke during the duration of an event. They slip away quickly for a smoke and come back. You could say \"he should have gotten a nicotine patch or bought some Nicorette gum.\" Ok, sure, but that's not what the social norm is. \n* Smoking inside someone's house is inconsiderate, I agree. However, you yourself said David's parents haven't communicated to him that they don't like this. As such, I doubt he knows they mind. \n* You didn't ask David's parents if they'd like you to speak to him about this. You overstepped here.\n* In line with above, you didn't inform David's parents he was in their house smoking, which is what you should have done. That would have been the appropriate response.\n* If David's parents *did* agree to you speaking to him about this, Katie's party was not the time. You should have spoken to him about this after the party for the very same reason that you were annoyed David had slipped away.\n\nWhat you did is kind of like vigilanteism. It's kind of like if someone committed a crime, and you take it upon yourself as an every day civilian to get a gun and go apprehend them. You're not allowed to  do that. It's against the law. Well, what you did is kind of like that because you broke certain social laws (i.e social norms and conventions) and overstepped and did something that the rest of society feels it was absolutely not your place to do. \n\nI also want to note that, even if your intentions were good, look at what happened. You seriously impacted Katie's birthday negatively. If you do not believe me about what I've said, this at the very least should tell you that you need to seriously rethink your actions, and ask yourself if maybe I and other posters are right. \n\nWe are. Trust me. I'm trying to look out for you here and help. I have no bone in this. I don't know you and certainly don't  dislike you. I'm being very civil. Some people in the comments are being kind of nasty -- that's common in this subreddit -- but why would I, someone who is being nice to you, lie about any of this? It's clear you care a lot about Katie, so I'm posting to sincerely try and help you understand what went wrong so you can prevent things like this happening in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, YTA.

Its the main reason why u should not smoke, then hold a baby or a child. Well smoking indoors is the same thing.

If they charged him with that responsibility, then sure, but that was never said to be the case so it would be best for OP to just stay in their lane as just another party attendee in this particular scenario.", "It's his patents house and he hasn't been told not to. They seem okay with it.", "Well, they are 12, at least a handful of them are terrible, just not around this issue! Haha", "YTA - as a smoker myself, I can confidently tell you do not get in a smokers face for smoking. He was away from the kids and everyone else. Yes he was a dick for smoking in the house but he wasn't smoking in front of the kids. You need to grow up and get off your high horse.", "More likely out of boredom unfortunately...", "Had to scroll down way too far to find this. \n\nThe smell of cigarette smoke hangs around forever if someone smokes indoors - smoking in the house of non-smokers is a huge asshole move. He could have just smoked outside the front door.\n\nDefinitely sounds like OP picked a bad time to point out what an asshole David was being, but that doesn't make David any less inconsiderate either.", "Then you talk it out, explain your point of view, offer an alternative, or talk to the homeowners. You do NOT start making demands in someone else\u2019s home, nor start a fight, nor should you make a scene at a child\u2019s party. If you\u2019re too emotionally immature and are going to act like a toddler, then you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to go places and cause problems for other people.", "*to be offended", "I figured he was in the bathroom with the extractor fan running. I don't know how well that hides cigarette smoke but that's what my sister was doing to hide the weed smoke at xmas years ago (we were at her house but she didn't want to smoke in front of our mum).", "And it's not like the parents have actually said anything about it. If they want him to stop he likely would've gone out front of the house to smoke. \n\n(I'm assuming he was getting high AF cos that would be a bit inappropriate)\n\nI'm 100% anti smoking, don't get the point hate the smell of both smoke and vapes but if your not doing it around me- especially when eating- or my kid I literally have no say in what you can or can't do outside of my house!", "It's the parents house and they had never told their son not to smoke in the family home, same as mine with me. If ANYONE other than my parents came in and did what OP did he'd have is teeth rammed down his throat. Who the f*ck appointed him as Lord and Master!", "Nah man, smoking inside is just gross and wrong, i wouldn't handle it in the best either because that would make me mad as hell. Totally gross.", "Yeah, I was looking for the part where it mentioned that it was OP's house, or that the dude was actually smoking crack, not cigarettes.", "The homeowners are the parents of the smoker so it's up to them to confront him. The OP could have mentioned to the parents that the brother was smoking inside but it wasn't his place to confront the brother.", "My parents don't smoke but they allow me and guests to. They don't drink either but keep alcohol for those who do. It's called being a good host.", "I get it but if ur at my house and I smoke, who r u to tell me I can\u2019t smoke in my house? That\u2019s why OP is AH. Smoking inside is gross, as a smoker I don\u2019t smoke in my house but if f I did I would tell u where the bear shits in the buckwheat if u tried to correct me. Now if I lit up in ur house I could react anyway u want. OP is AH of epic proportions because he picked a fight at a child\u2019s birthday for something that was away from everyone else and none of his god dam business", "Vapes with me. I love after a long day to settle down, put on a show, have some snacks, and vape.", "Well I'm sorry that you have allergies but thank you for not being a dick about it. My mom absolutely hates that I smoke and I can't do it standing 50 ft away from her without her complaining. It's like I get it, you have allergies. Don't stand on top of me when I'm smoking then. And yeah, you're right. He does need to mind his own business. I laughed out loud when I read the part where you said he's allergic to minding his own business. I'm going to use that from now on lol.", "Oh, it was the smoker's house... i fucked up there lmao, i didn't know. The only thing that would be gross is children entering his house because of what i said earlier but i totally missed the part that said it was the smoker's house. And that's my fault.", "It's absurd to compare this to eating pork in a Muslim or Jewish house: if you know anything at all about their dietary laws, you know that you'd essentially be making their homes unclean spiritually. You'd safely assume you ought not do that.\n\nThat isn't the case with smoking and drinking. Some people who don't smoke don't actually care if someone smokes in their house. Some people who don't drink don't mind if people drink in theirs. The point is, it was for the parents to sort out. They are grown ups, and it is offensive as for him to presume to dictate what happens in their home.", "Most non-smokers don't like the smell of smoke but choose to tolerate it for various reasons. Just because the parents have said they hate the smell of smoke doesn't mean they want to ban their son from smoking in the house. I hate the smell of smoke but I will visit smokers or hang out with smokers and just put up with the smell", "Which is again why I said ESH. OP overstepped and David is an asshole for smoking inside a nonsmokers home.", "But if you're in the home of someone who doesn't smoke or drink, unless they tell you it's ok, it would be rude and disrespectful to smoke and drink in their home. It seems that the parents have issues communicating to their son, which is their problem, and why at the end of the day ESH. OP overstepped and David assumed it wasn't an issue to smoke inside instead of clearing it with his parents.", "My mom was a smoker and she always smoked by an open window. You wouldn't even know a smoker lived there if you visited.\n\nI think there's some details missing. OP is making it sound like David lit a cigarette on their sofa in the middle of the living room. The reaction is cause for an eye roll or a sarcastic comment at best. Ruining a child's birthday party by starting a screaming match and causing a scene and then blaming it the hosts son is over the top. It's an issue between David and his parents that can be sort out later.", "What if he did speak to the parents before lighting up and they said it's okay? OP wouldn't know that when he started the fight and I doubt the smoker had time to react before being yelled at.\n\nI'm not saying I think that was the case, but for all we know it could be that the parents have told him it's okay and to keep the peace with OP they claimed they \"forgot\". No matter what else, I don't believe they just forgot.\n\nEdit: I just reread the post and comments from OP and he says they are not good communicators, not that they forgot. So for whatever bad reason OP butted in and decided to have a screaming match in the middle of a child's party.\n\nYou ARE the asshole, OP.", "Pathetic was the word that sprang to mind for me as well.", "Yeah exactly, he wouldn\u2019t have missed the opportunity", "Y\u2019all really see it worse to smoke a harmless plant he may even be using for medical purposes, over a fucking toxic stick that has killed millions?", "Maybe not in your experience but in mine it is. Whatever.", "As an alpha version means unfinished, not ready to be released to the public, even unsafe to use. That seems accurate. \n\nLook like this one showed his flaws. Time to get fixed.", "Things have changed a lot in the past few decades. The social norm nowadays is to not smoke inside - everybody knows that secondhand smoke is bad for others. I live in a country where smoking is still very common, and it's still the norm to go outside to smoke rather than do so indoors. And if you're at someone's house, go to their balcony or go outside. And first, ask for permission from all of the guests.", "But we don't know if these people allow their own son to do it. Parents be like that. Make the rules for everyone, then let their own kids slide. If this guy lit up so nonchalantly in his parents house, then it's likely he's been allowed to.", "I was waiting to read that part too.", "It's not davids house it is the parents house", "If my adult son come to my house and smokes inside I will deal with it, I don't need some other family member confronting my son and causing a big scene at child's birthday party", "There is no spiritual problem of someone eating pork in a home owned by a Jew. My daughter\u2019s nurses eat McDonald\u2019s all the time while caring for her and it\u2019s not an issue.\n\nThe problem is one of contaminating cooking and/or eating utensils with physical traces of a non-kosher food/drink. Pork is not particularly special in this regard. This is not a spiritual problem, but a physical one. \n\nFood leaves traces; ask anyone with severe celiac about how hard it is to get rid of wheat traces. If non-kosher food rests on a porous surface, that surface now has to be Kashered to remove any trace of the food. Some things cannot ever have the traces removed and are no longer usable as a result. This is why my cleaning woman now owns several plates I accidentally put through the wrong dishwasher.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you got the idea that pork could \u2018spiritually contaminate\u2019 a home, but it\u2019s utter nonsense, at least as far as Judaism is concerned. That said, it can still cause plenty of other problems, so we\u2019d prefer if people didn\u2019t.", "The question was \"am I the AH for yelling at my wife's brother\"", "My sincerest apologies. The Jewish people I know object very strongly to having pork in their homes and they phrased it as a religious issue, not as a cleanliness issue. I didn't know how to phrase that. I've lived in two Muslim majority countries and bringing pork into the homes of the people I knew would have been incredibly offensive to them--because it is unclean, but also because they feel it offends God. Again, I didn't know a better way to phrase it. \n\nBut thanks for explaining. Would you mind telling me what kinds of things can't be Kashered?", "Totally agree. Hopefully this keeps improving."]}
