You asked your GF not to kill it and she did it anyway and laughed at you. Whether a person value's an insect's life or not, killing something when you know it will upset someone you care about (and especially laughing about it) *is* inconsiderate.

I suspect that if she had killed a praying mantis or a ladybug or some insect that is \"more likeable\" than a fly, this comment section wouldn't be being so harsh on you.

You tried really hard to hide it, but the language you use is very telling, lol.", "Because at the time, you did not clarify in your original post that you communicated the need for personal space. Also, in your other responses, you just stated that you said you needed time. \n\nAs I mentioned, giving someone the silent treatment is a toxic behavior. It\u2019s rooted in punishing someone for doing something the other person didn\u2019t like. If you just said you needed time, without explaining, while that makes her an AH for not respecting your boundaries, if someone is not aware of why you had such a visceral response, they\u2019re confused, hurt, and that\u2019s not fair to another person to leave them \u201changing\u201d in a sense. <\u2014-Everything *before* you commented that you explained it to her made her disrespect the AH moment for her, but your toxic response the AH moment for you, hence my ESH vote.", "You suck to her because your values don\u2019t match. She doesn\u2019t care about the fly, your feelings about it, or the boundaries you said you needed. You need to find someone who is just as sensitive as you are. It sounds like you didn\u2019t give her the silent treatment because of the fly, but because she ignored your feelings about the fly. It is a little unusual to be that upset over a fly because life is tough. So it\u2019s not a horrible response to call you out on your need for space over something so small. But this seems to be important to you so you need to find someone who matches your values.", "III dunno man you said \"silent treatment\". That's social punishment if it was taking the time you need NVM those are different things. Communication would be the difference but that's well covered by other comments\n\nI'm not saying she didn't do anything wrong I'm just not talking to her", "No, you knew what you were doing and what you are doing right now. You never gave a fuck about that fly. Grow up and stop trying to be manipulative and controlling. This is pathetic.", "If you cared so much about it, you should have dealt with it. also YTA for using \"Irregardless\"", "Again... We are talking about FLIES.... Jesus christ. Do you care about the sanctity of the lives of leeches? What about hook worms? Tape worms? How about Botfly's? Mosquitoes? Mosquitoes offer nothing to the planet and have directly killed more people throughout history than anything else combined. Are their lives also just as important as a new born babies? Fuck off mate, this is the most pathetic morale grandstand Ive ever seen.", "Buddhists are just an example of a group that wouldn\u2019t find this silly, proving that what you consider silly is arbitrary and not objective. OP doesn\u2019t need to share their religion to validate their beliefs.\n\nA nazis views are inherently bigoted and harmful, not wanting to kill bugs is not at all comparable and you know that so why even make such a statement?", "Who says I\u2019m not?", "it sounds like the OP and his girlfriend are teens, so yeah, she should listen to him", "You\u2019re a clown lol", "She doesn\u2019t have to, but lying about it and not giving a shit about my feelings is wrong", "Fu*king", "I mean of I ask someone not to do something in my house and they ignored me I'd ask them to leave.", "Yeah, it does", "That\u2019s what I asked too. Maybe he is 10? I don\u2019t know anyone who says this past the age of 10.", "Yes, that is true. What the hell talking about? Lmao", "Sorry, it does matter.  If you tell your SO not to do something, they should respect it, even if you think it's silly like not killing a fly.  She had no reason to kill the fly other than to upset OP.  That is very concerning.  Then she laughed at him for that.  That is not normal or healthy behavior.\n\nAlso, it is fairly normal behavior to respect life.  I hate spiders, and don't hesitate to kill them.  But I know many who   insist on capturing them and releasing them.  I would respect their wishes if they were present, even though I hate hate HATE spiders.", "That doesn\u2019t refute the fact that *it* does upset me and she knew that and chose to cruelly rub it in my face anyways.", "I kill flies too, but a guy can be sensitive leave him be", "I did communicate that I needed space. She ignored that boundary.", "Yes, all lives are equal in my eyes. If mosquitoes didn't carry life threatening diseases I would have no problem allowing them to suck my blood. Everything has a right to life, maybe you should expand your horizons a bit, and not think so primitively. [Here's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocentrism_(ethics)) a link to the ethics that op believes in, and I do as well.", "Yeah, and like I said, that doesn't change how ridiculous it is... Again, most Buddhists, the people you are using as an example, more often than not, don't follow this belief. \n\nAnd guess what, the ones who do prescribe to that belief are very good at setting that boundary within their relationships. This is obviously just something the OP decided they would try to randomly enforce and not a serious belief. \n\nAs for the nazi example, my point is that OP is obviously trying to manipulate their GF and is using the facade of making a request that is innocent at face value. This is text bool manipulation that leads to more drastic requests later on.\n\nMoralw of the story, if OP cared that much about bugs, he would have expressed that to his GF before this situation ever even came up. This is textbook manipulation, and now he wants reddit to lick his wounds.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "You need to smoke some weed", "You\u2019re sensitive and that\u2019s OK but You should dump her she clearly doesn\u2019t care about your feelings", "Not at all, about something like this not even a teen should listen. And if anything, she would have to listen to the parents, not the boyfriend", "You're obviously a child and someone who is a narcissist. Don't have kids and stay away from people in general you asshole", "Don't be offensive because you have been called out lol it's childish", "mY fEeLiNgS \ud83e\udd15\ud83c\udfbb it's a damn fly, sit the fuck down.\n\nYTA", "Again the solution is obvious", "What about HER feelings then? You're wrong too for trying to get her to act according to YOUR beliefs regardless of her discomfort. If you wanna go there, we can paint you as the asshole too.", "Ah, I forgot that you lose your free will once you go to another persons house.", "She has a reason to kill to the fly - because she doesn't like it. OP wasn't able to deal with it, so she did. I can't believe what I'm reading honestly. Over a fly.... A literal pest.", "Flies carry disease, what if she got sick from OP insisting on letting the fly chill in their room? What if she was immuno compromised? There is no reason to emotionally abuse your partner (intentionally ignoring them/refusing to talk to them is a punishment being used. It\u2019s abuse.) in response to a disease ridden bug getting squashed. Actually think it through for longer than two seconds. OP needs psychological help.", "I\u2019m beginning to think you\u2019re narcissistic. Me me me me me is all I\u2019m getting from you. Me me me my feelings my feelings my feelings", "If someone is actually that sensitive than they should probably get a mental health evaluation. Very strange.  It's also really controlling.", "Boundaries are not something you use to control others. They are used to lay out expectations and consequences.", "Lol you're an absolute clown. You don't even understand the \"ethics\" you just linked. \n\n\"Biocentrism does not imply the idea of equality among the animal kingdom, for no such notion can be observed in nature\" It literally states that they understand that not all living things are equal and no where does it say that they would be opposed to killing a fly. Did you even read the article before linking it and deciding it would define your personality?", "I did not say Buddhists follow ahimsa towards insects, I just said they would not see OPs values as silly and ridiculous like you did. This was brought up to express that your definition of silly was not objective.\n\nNot having previously brought it up is not evidence of manipulation, it\u2019s not as if people infodump every detail about themselves upon meeting someone. Thats like the whole point of dating, to get to know someone better.", "Is this dude commenting so frequently a Buddist, or just an asshole speaking on behalf of all Buddists? Don't assume most Buddhists go around killing things that are simply existing, regardless of what they are. You're so obnoxious and ignorant.", "Yeah like gf is clearly not the right fit for OP. She seems to have a cruel side to her. OP does need to learn to be mature though and speak up for himself and communicate", "No, they\u2019re teens. You should listen to him. while at his house No questions asked.", "I am a kid and you\u2019re a clown. How is that offensive? Lol.", "I just think he\u2019s eleven and online way too much.", "Okay, you\u2019re free to think so, still doesn\u2019t change the fact my girlfriend went out of her way to do something that would upset me and bragged about it", "And I think it\u2019s OK that he\u2019s sensitive I can agree to disagree on that He just asked her not to kill a life that he cared about how is that controlling", "Perhaps you misunderstood, I don't mean equal in the sense that you mean. I mean that everything has a right to life. Sorry that's beyond your comprehension. Enjoy destroying this planet and all life inhabiting it with your archaic viewpoints.", "If your relationship is at the point that you're just hanging out in each others bedrooms, you would have definitely discussed the fact that you are vehemently opposed to the idea of killing a fly... That's not some minor insignificant detail about your personality that you just overlook.\n\nAlso, my view that being opposed to killing flies is ridiculous is 100% objective and the correct opinion... You can disagree, but you wouldn't be acting very objectively if you were to do so.", "We are talking about flies here... Let's not forget that. Why are you trying to conflate that to Buddhists killing things for simply existing? Either you're not very smart, or you feel attacked because I struck a nerve with your behaviour."]}
