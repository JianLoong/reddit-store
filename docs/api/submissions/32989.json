You asked your GF not to kill it and she did it anyway and laughed at you. Whether a person value's an insect's life or not, killing something when you know it will upset someone you care about (and especially laughing about it) *is* inconsiderate. At the end of the day, a spider is not \"more important\" than a fly. I suspect that if she had killed a praying mantis or a ladybug or some insect that is \"more likeable\" than a fly, this comment section wouldn't be being so harsh on you.
