However, if these ladies are simply slow to get a hint and not acting maliciously, establish a boundary. Be a grown up and call them and say \"I've totally revamped my wardrobe and I am so happy with the results! Thank you so much for all you've passed down to me before I lost the weight but I won't be accepting any more donations now  because I simply don't have room - and I love what I have.\" (if true) If one of them calls to say they are dropping something off, ask what it is. Gently remind them - Oh! You must have forgotten! Remember that day I called to tell you . . . \" and reiterate that boundary. If they show up with bags ask \"do you want to find someone else to take those or do you prefer that I drop them off at the charity shop?\" and reiterate your boundary.
