He has a daughter, Ella (11F). Ella and I are very close and she\u2019s gotten to be good friends with my sisters daughter Maddy (10F).\n\nThere was a large festival type event in our town last weekend. Ella is the one who originally saw the ad for the event a few weeks before and she got Maddy excited about it so the two of them asked if I would take them. It looked like a lot of fun so I told them I\u2019d be happy to go with them. \n\nElla came down with an illness while at her moms last week and was still unwell the day of the festival so she stayed home with her mother. My niece still wanted to go so we did and we had a great time together.

Ella had not realized we had still attended without her and got very upset when Maddy tried to tell her about the event. She said it was \u201cher idea\u201d and that we weren\u2019t supposed to go without her. She called her dad after school and told him that we had been unfair to her by stealing her plans and having fun without her. \n\nI understand that mentality from an 11 year old but I was absolutely shocked that my husband came home and picked an argument with me about it. Firstly, he knew Maddy and I still went and he said nothing. and secondly, it\u2019s unfair that Ella caught a bug but Maddy did nothing wrong and I\u2019m free to spend my time with my niece if I choose. John insisted that I should prioritize Ellas feelings because stepmother is a chosen commitment that\u2019s greater than niece but I simply don\u2019t see it that way, I love them both and sometimes shit\u2019s just unfair.

Children need to learn life is unfair, and this should have been a perfect chance to show her that. Instead it seems she's being given the okay to be a brat", "NTA. You couldn't have foreseen she'd get upset you went without her. It's good to keep in mind to be upfront with her. I think the core issue is that she couldn't go to what clearly meant something to her.\n\nYour husband's reaction is unreasonable but understandable. His daughter was upset. But he still put this on you. The fact this has drawn out for a week? That's befuddling.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nThe fact that you hid it from her and went instead of having an open and honest conversation about still wanting to take Maddy is the biggest issue here. If it was Ella's idea in the first place, I'm sure it would have meant much more to her that you asked how she felt about it instead of doing it behind her back.\n\nYou aren't the AH for going, but you are for the way you went about it.", "NTA But I\u2019d be considering my role in the relationship if he is going to talk to you like that.", "Husband is the AH.

I hope showing him this post makes him come to his senses and he apologises to you. \n\nOne girl is related by blood. The others hinges on who you are with. If you break up, she\u2019d no longer be your stepdaughter. Your niece will always be your niece. I find his argument flawed. \n\nElla needs to learn being sick means you miss out. This would have been a good opportunity for dad to teach her the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t \u201cprioritize\u201d anyone, you stuck to your commitment to your niece, just as you would have done if she and your step daughter swapped places.", "Yup, great teachable moment the dad didn't even wave at while it passed by. Also, teaching that just because Ella was *unable* to go, that didn't mean Maddie shouldn't get to go. A bit of an empathy lesson that flew by, too. NTA", "What the fuck is wrong with you? You chose to come on this sub. Stop being a misogynistic asshole.", "She should have phoned Ella's mum while Ella was sick to ask to have a conversation with Ella about how she's still going to take her niece to a festival?\n\nI'm sure that would have gone down like a ton of bricks", "Don\u2019t be ridiculous - the child was with her mother"]}
