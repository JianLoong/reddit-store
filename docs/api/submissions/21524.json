Children this age are VERY ego centric, it's well researched that they truly think the world revolves around them in some way. If your niece was sick would your husband have been the first to jump and say his daughter shouldn't go either? As a parent, I doubt it, because we all want our children to be top priority. However putting your child first at the expense of others is not the right message.  Misery loves company is not the right message. Unless it was her birthday, wedding, graduation, or anniversary,  the world and public events continue without her. It is sad, but when your friends cancel on you, you and hubby do not just sit around not having fun because it wouldn't be fair. This is silly of your husband and ego centric in a way that most adults have outgrown and setting a very poor example of how much control a single person has over the lives of other people.", "NTA and your husband is raising his daughter to be an entitled, spoiled little brat.  Yes, it's sad that Ella couldn't go and being upset is understandable.

I learned very young, that just because I can't go to an event including a breakfast being held for me (I got the flu on the day friends decided to celebrate my birthday), doesn't mean other people shouldn't go and have fun. Life happens and sometimes you don't get what you want.  And you don't get to do what you had planned and someone else does.", "NTA. But, pick your battles. If this is a one-off situation, then maybe you let it ride knowing it was a big deal to her. Pay attention to emerging patterns, however because now that she knows she can successfully pit your husband against you it could become a big problem.", "NTA. You helped your niece show empathy for her friend, Ella.  Ella showed Maddie that acts of kindness are not always gracefully received and jealousy is ugly.

That's nice, right? They always made it fair for me, even if it screwed over everyone else. Then I was a young adult who thought no one cared about me because they did not, in fact, make everything revolve around what worked for me. I wish someone would have taught me when I was 11 that it sucked that I missed out on fun because I was sick, but that it was ok and I wasn't being excluded. It was a shit thing to have to learn the hard way as a young adult, and honestly I was a bit of a crap friend for a while until I did learn that just because my mom and grandparents' lives revolved around me didn't mean my friends or partners lives did to the same degree. Please actually fight this one with your husband on your stepdaughter's behalf. It sucks she was sick, and it's totally OK that she was upset about it. She's 11. Teaching her how to manage those feelings is your job as parents. Protecting her from learning how to deal with them is just crippling her emotionally in the long run, and it will hurt her way more when she's at an age where you can't protect her.", "NTA.

I (35f) got sick right before a major event for my company that I had worked my butt off to promote and plan and I was so sad I couldn't attend. But I couldn't attend bc of my contagious illness and that's just part of life. Kids need to learn that", "If the gender roles were reversed how much do you wanna bet they would still side with the mom lol.", "NTA. This is a good opportunity to talk to Ella about empathy and understanding other people\u2019s perspectives. How would she have felt if Maddie had gotten sick and you had canceled the plans and made her stay home? Would she have been happy to miss out just because Maddie was sick? No probably, so she should understand why Maddie didn\u2019t miss out because she was sick.", "Nah. If I had plans to take my three youngest somewhere and one got sick, that doesn\u2019t mean the other two don\u2019t get to go. That\u2019s life - sometimes you get sick and miss out, sometimes someone else gets sick and misses out.", "Yes, it sounds like he\u2019s taking the easy way out by siding with a child who doesn\u2019t understand how life works. He just wants someone to be upset with\n\nNTA", "Right? My friends have plans for a fun Friday night out and I came down with a cold. I'm not horribly sick but I certainly don't want to give it to anyone.  Thems the breaks, sometimes you're able to follow through with plans, sometimes you aren't.  It happens", "Some people around here act like all 11 year olds should have the maturity of a 41 year old and never have moments of weakness or anger and if they do they\u2019re 100% manipulating", "But she didn't prioritize her, if OP and dad have a kid of their own will that kid not be allowed to do any fun events while Ella is at her mom's?", "He could explain that they paid for tickets and if they didn\u2019t go, all that money goes to waste. As well as, hey, they were looking forward to it too.", "They already have a kid of their own. Their daughter. Doesn't matter if it's blood or not."]}
