Children this age are VERY ego centric, it's well researched that they truly think the world revolves around them in some way. If your niece was sick would your husband have been the first to jump and say his daughter shouldn't go either? As a parent, I doubt it, because we all want our children to be top priority. However putting your child first at the expense of others is not the right message.  Misery loves company is not the right message. Unless it was her birthday, wedding, graduation, or anniversary,  the world and public events continue without her. It is sad, but when your friends cancel on you, you and hubby do not just sit around not having fun because it wouldn't be fair. This is silly of your husband and ego centric in a way that most adults have outgrown and setting a very poor example of how much control a single person has over the lives of other people.", "NTA and your husband is raising his daughter to be an entitled, spoiled little brat.  Yes, it's sad that Ella couldn't go and being upset is understandable.

I learned very young, that just because I can't go to an event including a breakfast being held for me (I got the flu on the day friends decided to celebrate my birthday), doesn't mean other people shouldn't go and have fun. Life happens and sometimes you don't get what you want.  And you don't get to do what you had planned and someone else does.", "NTA. But, pick your battles.

Pay attention to emerging patterns, however because now that she knows she can successfully pit your husband against you it could become a big problem.", "NTA.

That's nice, right? They always made it fair for me, even if it screwed over everyone else. Then I was a young adult who thought no one cared about me because they did not, in fact, make everything revolve around what worked for me. I wish someone would have taught me when I was 11 that it sucked that I missed out on fun because I was sick, but that it was ok and I wasn't being excluded. It was a shit thing to have to learn the hard way as a young adult, and honestly I was a bit of a crap friend for a while until I did learn that just because my mom and grandparents' lives revolved around me didn't mean my friends or partners lives did to the same degree. Please actually fight this one with your husband on your stepdaughter's behalf. It sucks she was sick, and it's totally OK that she was upset about it. She's 11. Teaching her how to manage those feelings is your job as parents.

She would get majorly upset if her friends did something without her or she found out we did something with the other kids while she was on her bio mom's time.  \n\nIt was a real struggle in the preteen years especially, until we sat her down and explained to her that our lives don't just pause because she's not home.  We miss her dearly.  And we love her.  And we want her with us all the time.  That's just not how it was meant to be and we all struggle with those feelings when she's with her biomom.  We asked her - do you really want us to sit around and be bored and not enjoy the world simply because you are not here?  How would that make YOU feel if we asked you not to do anything with your other family because we weren't there?  \n\nIt gave her some perspective, although the FOMO never really went away overall.

The daughter wont believe it not for a while and in that time bitterness can grow. In my case it happened many times over years but everyone handles it differently. Especially when there is that divide of step parent while the actual parent is still living actions like this absolutely push wedges between people. Petty things sure but a child is cruel.

OP seems not to realize how badly she hurt the daughter's feelings somthing she realistically confined in either biomother or her father.

Again what parent doesn't want their kid to be happy.\n\nThe Husband is an AH for the way he went about it. That way was wrong. Daughter is a child and has no stake exept the potenential end of her and OPs relationship. OP is a AH for not realizing how badly she hurt her stepduaghter. It's a bad situation all around. I just sorry for the daughter getting fucked out of fun that other get to have in your stead by the people who are supposed to to love you like their own hurts a lot. But eventually you just realize that you will never matter to them deep down and you pity them instead of hate them(this is the mindset that grows with this kind of bitterness).

Ig in my head, the common factor for these two specifically to go together was Ella, but ig the aunt can be close the niece without the stepdaughter. I\u2019m not tryna be shady btw", "Exactly this. NTA.\n\nAnd maybe unpopular opinion but an 11 year old is old enough to not be a brat about this. She may be upset she missed it and cry about it, but for her to think others should miss the fun or the world should stop is just a sign that the parents need to do more parenting.", "That\u2019s exactly it. I\u2019m the oldest of 4, one goes down you don\u2019t drag down the rest. And it will happen to everyone. Overall, it nets out.", "Yup. My two are 4 years apart. There were lots of times that activities for one weren't age appropriate for the other.  That's life. Neither would have wanted the other to miss out, even if they were personally disappointed.", "But her dad is a brat as well and told his wife that his daughter is more important than her neice. NTA", "Idk; it depends greatly on the kid. Every kid is different and develops at different rates. An 11 year olds brain is still very much developing various skills daily- emotional ones included. What\u2019s important though is that parents actually teach their child about empathy/emotions when situations like OPs happen (rather than her husband just completely dropping the ball and endorsing his little girls selfish perspective.) don\u2019t get mad at children for acting childish; they\u2019re supposed to. But it\u2019s up to the parent to teach them how to respond appropriately as they age.", "I was thinking the same thing!", "You're focused on the wrong thing, but fine, I'll try again. If stepmom and dad make another kid, will that kid not be allowed to do anything fun while Ella is at her mom's?", "NTA the entitlement is strong in this one", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019ve been chronically I\u2019ll for 7 years. I have never once wanted other people to miss out hunts because I have. I wasn\u2019t sick at 11 so it\u2019s most likely a brain development thing. Ella feels unincluded and left out. Think of something else she would like and buy her something she likes. In my case it would be the aquarium and a stuffed animal or dragon toy. Ella isn\u2019t trying to be rudeish and annoying. I understand how left out she feels. It hurts to look forward to something and have it ripped away. I know this girl isn\u2019t sick anymore but try to make sure she\u2019s ok.", "NTA. \n\nThe only way you could have handled this better is if you spoke about it to Ella beforehand, so she wouldn't be blindsided and react emotionally. Ask what she'd want to do if the situation were reversed (she was healthy but Maddie was sick). \n\nApart from that, your husband shouldn't throw you under the bus like this.", "NTA, your husband is right that your daughter (step or otherwise) should be your number 1 priority, not your niece. However, making a big deal out of a small situation as this one and blindly taking the daughter's side is just silly.", "NTA\nUnless it was a private festival no one could gatekeep it\nA child is allowed to have feelings about missing out on an event she was excited for, and wouldn't be surprised if she projects that feeling into the wrong people, as she is still developing emotional skills\nA competent parent/caregiver would've used this opportunity to teach her about emotions", "NTA. It might be one thing to not go to something if you could postpone till the other person is well, but in this case I\u2019m assuming it was a festival that was only one weekend. There was no point to you sitting around and missing it just because she couldn\u2019t go. She\u2019s being an 11 year old, ie immature so I won\u2019t be too hard on her, but hopefully will learn the rest of the world doesn\u2019t stop because of her.", "nta, your husband is being childish", "NTA.\nIt sucks that your stepdaughter got sick and had to miss out, but she was at her mothers, so there was no need for you to give up your plans", "NTA and your husband needs to learn how to parent his daughter better. \n\nAlso please do update us on how he deduced that your commitment to your stepdaughter is more important than the one to your niece. Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good or healthy to compare or rank relationships. But by any standards possible your niece would come on top: you\u2019ve known her for even longer than him let alone his daughter AND she\u2019s closely related to you. By blood.", "NTA, could've been a good teaching moment but husband siding with her makes it sound like kid's gonna get spoiled, as someone with a sister of the similar age, there have been so many moments where she's acted like a brat and mom's supported her crap, makes them think that they can get away with anything. My sister's a year younger even and there is no way she's too young for it to be okay to behave like this, she's mature enough to know.", "TA,\n\nHear me out. \nFor example, if you found out about a new restaurant that was about to open and you got sick and couldn't go, then your husband decided to take his best friend instead, brings you back some leftovers and bragged about how good it was. 11 year old or not. Baby girl was hurt and was in her emotions rightfully. Your husband is TA too...he knew he probably didn't think she would find out about it.", "I'd just reverse it on him. What if the niece had been sick. His daughter would have still wanted to go. Would he have said no, it's unfair to go without the niece?  Of course not. He'd probably have insisted they still go.", "My parents and I had tickets for one of the main tour points on a Rammstein tour. So it was a BIG concert but I got a fever a high fever so I couldn\u2019t go. My parents went there nonetheless and they had a really good time and I was happy for them. They sold my ticket so no money was wasted. Don\u2019t get me wrong I was sad and fomo was real but just because I\u2019m sick why should my parents suffer and loose a great amount of money?\n\nI think it is only natural to go when one person gets sick, it happens. And as the first few commenters said: it\u2019s a shame that a good teaching opportunity got wasted.", "NTA but your husband is a major one.", "NTA. John needs to get a grip.", "NTA.    He is.    He is raising an entitled brat.", "YTA. Ella\u2018s needs are not more important that Maddy\u2018s. Like what is going on with your husband.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t disappoint the other child in the equation for no reason. Ella is old enough to understand that you can\u2019t cancel the plans just because she is sick and you brought her gifts too. Your hubby on the other hand is a major one. If he had issues with you going he could have said before you left. He should have explained to Ella on the phone that it would t have been fair to everyone not yo go because she was ill, then instead of coming home to argue with you, he should have stood beside you on it, United force. He\u2019s behaved like a d*ck.", "Why didn't your sister take her daughter to the event instead of you.", "Reminds me of my husbands ex wife saying that we shouldn't be doing any fun stuff with my kids when we didn't have sd.\n\nNope lady my kids aren't going to sit around at home all weekend because you say so.", "NTA.  Ella is eleven, your husband is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nHubby is a dick tho", "NTA\n\nNot everyone puts their life on gold when you get sick. I'm an only child and I couldn't expect others not to go somewhere cause I couldn't. \nGoing there was a commitment to two girls, not just one.", "NTA\n\nI get the actions of an 11yo, responsible adults should be showing her that others can still get on with their lives and just because she is sick doesn't mean that the world stops for everyone.\n\nPandering to her r mini tantrum is just going to reinforce that the world should revolve around her and create a spoilt, entitled child.\n\nIf she is sick and at her mothers its unrealistic to say that you shouldn't go with your niece.  He needs to realise that his daughter is not the focal point of everything.", "NTA\n\n> I should prioritize Ellas feelings because stepmother is a chosen commitment that\u2019s greater than niece but I simply don\u2019t see it that way\n\nThat's just stupid", "Mum of two teens - if we have plans for a big event and one gets sick, damn straight the other kid is going. My ill kid will get a special outing another day. That's life.\n\nNTA", "NTA - but your husband is 100% creating the dynamic of \u201cif Ella can\u2019t have fun, then no one can\u201d. Given the fact that he basically endorsed her acting like that, will not bode well if it\u2019s not nipped in the bud in the future.", "John's being unreasonable.", "In addition to this it\u2019s not like there was malicious intent. They went out of their way and bought presents for Ella. That was a very sweet gesture and was totally disregarded. Ella wasn\u2019t appreciative at all. \n\nI feel like the husband is trying to compensate for the guilt he feels for not having full custody of his daughter. This is something he should seek someone to talk to, like a counselor or therapist. \n\nOverall, Ella needs to learn that others shouldn\u2019t miss out on things just because she can\u2019t go. It\u2019s not a logical mindset to have, and it\u2019s simply selfish. If it\u2019s not corrected with proper guidance of insight she\u2019s going to grow up to be a brat. I think the solution would be to talk to her. She\u2019s just a kid and needs to be taught to process emotions.", "She's being a child, which should be expected because, yanno...she's a child. The dad is being ridiculous, tho. He should know better, and it's his job to teach his daughter better when these kinda situations arise. What's worse is that he didn't just miss out on this potentially great teachable moment, but he actively went entirely the wrong way with it and turned it into a teachable moment on how to be a narcissistic asshole.", "She shouldn't \"let it ride\", her husband is being a brat and trying to drive a wedge in OPs family relationships as a lil bonus, they actually very much need to deal with this", "You would ditch your niece to stay home and what, think about your sick stepdaughter that is with her mom??", "This!!!!", "Ella saw the ad but that doesn't mean she gets to control access to the event. It wasn't \"her\" event but a public event open to everyone. She doesn't get to gate-keep just because she's jealous. Your husband is 100% wrong. Show him this thread. NTA. Maddie doesn't need to be punished because Ella was sick.", "Absolutely. It comes  across as, 'if Ella couldn't go, then nobody should have gone', i.e. should the whole festival have been canceled. It's unfortunate that Ella got sick and missed out, but hey, they made sure they got gifts for her to try and make up for it.", "Even then, if I had tickets to take both my kids to a concert and one was sick, I'd still take my healthy child or send them with dad while me or dad stayed home with the sick child. Why should the other child miss out? I would acknowledge how much it sucks and organise a special outing once my child was ill again.", "I think validating her feelings is actually helpful. She was upset she missed out, and jealous that people went without her and that's ok. That doesn't mean it's ok for her to lash out at others, she needs help with expressing her emotions in an appropriate way.", "No because being a step mother is \u2018a chosen commitment that\u2019s more important than a niece\u2019 \ud83d\ude44 umm wtf lmao \n\nNTA", "The company didn't cancel the event? My god, such AHs, look for a different job!       /s", "This is probably one of the few cases where that phrase actually makes sense. So many times it\u2019s \u201clife isn\u2019t fair\u201d in relation to ridiculously skewed laws or situations where someone\u2019s choosing to be an asshole and be unfair. Here at least.. it is a case of life just really isn\u2019t fair sometimes. Like getting your period early during a pool party.", "He he. You\u2019re right! \ud83d\ude02\n\nYes, there are exceptions to the rule. If birthday person got sick the party would be cancelled.", "Let's be real here, we all know that it's Mrs.Claus who does all the work of Christmas anyway, so if Santa gets sick, meh, the show still goes on ;)", "ESPECIALLY that Ella wasn\u2019t even in the same house at the time, so it\u2019s not like she watched them leave and come home.", "Exactly! Years ago my oldest daughter won tickets to the premiere of a movie. She had lupus and ended up not being able to make it. But she stayed home with her father and I took my other kids who had been looking forward to it. Sometimes life sucks... but all kids have to deal with disappointment along the way.", "This. \nI'm the oldest in the sibling pack. And that's how the rules were. \nThe only whining there would he from the one who got sick would be \"you better take the money I saved up and buy me something from the place.\" (All said in a fun tone)", "The niece is OP's sister's daughter. Why can't she be close to her without her stepdaughter to her own sibling's child?", "Looking at the way her dad treated the situation explain A LOT. He is the reason that little girl is acting selfish and thinks the world revolves around her. He needs to man up and realize he's supposed to be her parent, not her friend.", "As stated previously, I\u2019m not used to that, hence why I was asking and said \u201cnot trying to be shady\u201d", "Yeah my gut here is that Ella responded like a kid upset about not going and at that age she probably just needed a reminder that if roles where reversed she would want to go. \n\nI\u2019m more concerned that OP\u2019s husband knew she took Maddy and only seemed to object when Ella got upset. My first thought is wondering if maybe he\u2019s taking an opportunity to indulge his daughter and score some brownie points. \n\nI mean he\u2019s divorced or at least not with Ella\u2019s mom and is it possible he\u2019s maybe being more lenient on her than he would be if he wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s completely out of pocket for OP\u2019s husband to take an 11 year olds side and by doing so, green light selfish impulses in his daughter which means he is failing her as a parent in that moment and in the same breath shaming his wife for being close to her niece and making her feel bad when she did nothing wrong. \n\nIt comes off as a complete willingness to throw OP to the wolves and given he\u2019s her life partner I would be pissed if my partner did this. They\u2019re supposed to be a team and here he is holding her in front of his tween child like a sacrificial lamb. And he\u2019s been acting irritated and annoyed with OP for a week. That\u2019s childish behavior you would expect from someone who doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s not ok to ice people out you expect to stick around just because your mad. \n\nNTA Op and you have a serious conversation about partnership with your husband. And if he doesn\u2019t seem to get it then take this opportunity to set a hard boundary so he gets the message you won\u2019t put up with this treatment from him again.", "Exactly. It\u2019s likely this kid is so wrapped up in how she is feeling that she\u2019s not pulling her world view out far enough to take a moment and say \u201cif roles where reversed how would I feel?\u201d Sometimes kids just need a parent to help frame it for them. And it\u2019s concerning OP\u2019s husband is so unwilling to do that when he didn\u2019t seem to have an issue before Ella found out."]}
