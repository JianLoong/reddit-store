He has a daughter, Ella (11F). Ella and I are very close and she\u2019s gotten to be good friends with my sisters daughter Maddy (10F).\n\nThere was a large festival type event in our town last weekend. Ella is the one who originally saw the ad for the event a few weeks before and she got Maddy excited about it so the two of them asked if I would take them. It looked like a lot of fun so I told them I\u2019d be happy to go with them. \n\nElla came down with an illness while at her moms last week and was still unwell the day of the festival so she stayed home with her mother. My niece still wanted to go so we did and we had a great time together.

Ella had not realized we had still attended without her and got very upset when Maddy tried to tell her about the event.

Children need to learn life is unfair, and this should have been a perfect chance to show her that. Instead it seems she's being given the okay to be a brat", "NTA. You couldn't have foreseen she'd get upset you went without her. It's good to keep in mind to be upfront with her. I think the core issue is that she couldn't go to what clearly meant something to her.\n\nYour husband's reaction is unreasonable but understandable. His daughter was upset. But he still put this on you. The fact this has drawn out for a week? That's befuddling.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nThe fact that you hid it from her and went instead of having an open and honest conversation about still wanting to take Maddy is the biggest issue here. If it was Ella's idea in the first place, I'm sure it would have meant much more to her that you asked how she felt about it instead of doing it behind her back.\n\nYou aren't the AH for going, but you are for the way you went about it.", "NTA But I\u2019d be considering my role in the relationship if he is going to talk to you like that.", "Husband is the AH. Plans change, people add or drop out, that\u2019s life. Everyone shouldn\u2019t suffer because Ella got sick. You are good in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nSo if one person got sick for Christmas the whole thing should be cancelled?\n\nYour husband is being a dick. I hope showing him this post makes him come to his senses and he apologises to you. \n\nOne girl is related by blood. The others hinges on who you are with. If you break up, she\u2019d no longer be your stepdaughter. Your niece will always be your niece. I find his argument flawed. \n\nElla needs to learn being sick means you miss out. This would have been a good opportunity for dad to teach her the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t \u201cprioritize\u201d anyone, you stuck to your commitment to your niece, just as you would have done if she and your step daughter swapped places.", "Yup, great teachable moment the dad didn't even wave at while it passed by. Also, teaching that just because Ella was *unable* to go, that didn't mean Maddie shouldn't get to go. A bit of an empathy lesson that flew by, too. NTA", "What the fuck is wrong with you? You chose to come on this sub. Stop being a misogynistic asshole.", "She should have phoned Ella's mum while Ella was sick to ask to have a conversation with Ella about how she's still going to take her niece to a festival?\n\nI'm sure that would have gone down like a ton of bricks", "Don\u2019t be ridiculous - the child was with her mother", "Nta. Your husband is something else\u2026", "God damn karma farmers", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being weird af. Ella is a kid who is suffering from delusions of being the centre of the universe. Your husband seems to be where she learnt it from. \n\nYou actually did a really nice thing by bringing Ella back gifts. Your husband has no right to expect you to forsake all other relationships in favour of his daughter. You\u2019re entitled to love your niece. \n\nYou\u2019re living with a pair of main characters.", "You did nothing wrong and maybe an 11 year old would not get it but your husband definitely should. He\u2019s gonna make her grow up to be entitled if he allows her to think she has the right to be upset. Yes you can be disappointed but you can\u2019t demand people to stay home just because u can\u2019t attend. You were thoughtful and got her gifts too so that she wouldn\u2019t feel like she completely missed out and it still wasn\u2019t good enough. Her dad should have explained to her that\u2019s not how the world works.", "NTA.\n\nElla's reaction was pretty normal for an 11 year old. It was a good opportunity for your husband to teach her how to handle disappointment but instead he indulged it. He's TA for the way he treated you and for not even trying to equip his daughter with that life skill.", "Nta. The world doesn\u2019t stop just because she is sick. Yes she found the activity but it doesn\u2019t belong to her. Your husband should have backed you up and understood the world doesn\u2019t revolve around his daughter", "NTA - had this issue with my then stepdaughter. She thought that we weren\u2019t allowed to go anymore do anything fun unless she was with us.  Husband/dad needs to explain to her that you are able to have fun with and without her.  \n\nIt would be an entirely different story if you purposely planned events to exclude her.", "Nta it not your fault ella was sick and couldnt go you had ever right to take maddy she is your niece and flesha and blood your life doesnt stop because your step daughter is with her mother and not you", "NTA at all.", "NTA. He's clueless as to how to handle Ella's feelings, so he takes his frustration out on you. No reasonable person would agree with him. Straighten him out.", "YTA. It was her idea and you should not have gone without her. That is just wrong and cruel", "NTA, at all.  Your husband, however, is ridiculous. @@", "NTA.  She was sick and couldn't go.  That is sad but no reason for you to cancel your plans. If the festival is still around, go with Maddy.  She needs to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her.  Her dad needs to understand this or you are in for a world of trouble.", "NTA life is not fair! It\u2019s not fair that Ella got sick it\u2019s not fair that everyone expects no one to go if Ella can\u2019t. That\u2019s not how life works.", "NTA - Ella us young and at that age children can be very dramatic. Her response was probably out of frustration and she\u2019ll get over it. Your husband is the problem though!", "NTA. But your husband sure is. This was a good teachable moment about how life is not always fair and there are times when that cannot be helped. And if the situation were reversed and Mandy had been the one who got sick, I don\u2019t think Ella would have insisted you two skip the event.", "NTA, you and your daughter have the right to a life outside of his kid.  She was sick and at her mom's house.  This does not mean that you child has to sit home and miss out.  Advice for the future, plan things with your daughter only and let her mom/dad take her places.", "NTA, I was in your stepdaughter's position when I was 5 or 6. I got sick and couldn't go with the entire family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings) to Fun Mountain water slide park and ended up staying with Nana (great-grandma) sure I was disappointed but I couldn't fault everyone for not cancelling the plans of 12 other people.", "You're NTA wtf is with your husband though? \n\n>John insisted that I should prioritize Ellas feelings because stepmother is a chosen commitment that\u2019s greater than niec\n\n\nThis is pretty cooked.", "NTA. Children this age are VERY ego centric, it's well researched that they truly think the world revolves around them in some way. If your niece was sick would your husband have been the first to jump and say his daughter shouldn't go either? As a parent, I doubt it, because we all want our children to be top priority. However putting your child first at the expense of others is not the right message.  Misery loves company is not the right message. Unless it was her birthday, wedding, graduation, or anniversary,  the world and public events continue without her. It is sad, but when your friends cancel on you, you and hubby do not just sit around not having fun because it wouldn't be fair. This is silly of your husband and ego centric in a way that most adults have outgrown and setting a very poor example of how much control a single person has over the lives of other people.", "NTA and your husband is raising his daughter to be an entitled, spoiled little brat.  Yes, it's sad that Ella couldn't go and being upset is understandable. But her father should be talking to her about processing disappointment and how life just isn't always fair and there will be other opportunities. Also about not projecting your disappointment on other innocent people.  You and Maddy did nothing wrong.", "NTA", "NTA. It is unfortunate that Ella wasn\u2019t able to go, and she can be upset about missing the fun, however expecting everyone else to not go is absurd. Maybe you can come up with something else for just you and Ella to do together, and soon. As for your husband, the commitment to your stepdaughter vs your niece is bs. You didn\u2019t ditch Ella, sneak away without her, and tried to hide it. Maddy is supposed to be disappointed because someone else got sick?", "YTA big time.\nWhat did you think would happen when you went to a festival YOUR daughter wanted to go to without her?\nStep daughter or biological daughter,doesn't matter. It's your daughter.", "NTA- There have been times in my life I have been sick or in the hospital for a condition I have.  I learned very young, that just because I can't go to an event including a breakfast being held for me (I got the flu on the day friends decided to celebrate my birthday), doesn't mean other people shouldn't go and have fun. Life happens and sometimes you don't get what you want.  And you don't get to do what you had planned and someone else does.", "NTA. But, pick your battles. If this is a one-off situation, then maybe you let it ride knowing it was a big deal to her. Pay attention to emerging patterns, however because now that she knows she can successfully pit your husband against you it could become a big problem.", "NTA. You helped your niece show empathy for her friend, Ella.  Ella showed Maddie that acts of kindness are not always gracefully received and jealousy is ugly.  I hope Ella's parents teach her about apologizing so her friendship with Maddie is not impacted.", "NTA. Sick people should stay away from crowds. Well people can still go.", "You're husband is working on raising a narcissist", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s ok for her to feel disappointed, that\u2019s natural at that age. But it\u2019s also ok for her to learn how to manage disappointment without misplacing blame. \n\nNo one did anything wrong, it is a bummer she missed out, and that\u2019s all there is to it.", "Nta john and Ella are being ridiculous. Nip this on the bud, tell john to stop his nonsense or you leave. He needs to respect you.", "Agreed, I\u2019d be interested to see what bio mom\u2019s take on the situation.", "The husband might have had an argument if his child had been staying with them, but the child was at her mother's. What OP does when the child is with their mom is none of the child's business, especially if OP didn't give away purchased tickets for OP and step-daughter to go together. \n\nThe only asshole in this situation is the husband who thinks OP should prioritize his kid over her niece.", "OP's husband is missing a major teachable moment here. Big fail.", "I think by the way he acts that and what he said that he actually expects her to take Ella and not Maddy every time because \u201cstep mom> niece\u201d according to him", "Yes, but she's a disappointed 11 year old, so she could get at least a partial pass.  Her father, on the other hand, needs a major reality check.  I wonder if anyone left a clue stick around anywhere.", "Misandristic response. Straighten him out for prioritizing THEIR daughter?\nOP has a kid now whether or not she gave birth to said child and needs to put the child at the forefront and not view it just as the step daughter.\nPlay the straighten him out game, and watch as that marriage deteriorates and crumbles.", "This is strange. Asking an 11 year old for permission to go somewhere? Lol", "R u serious she needs to ask an 11 year old permission to keep a promise she also made to her niece?", "R u serious she needs to ask an 11 year old permission to keep a promise she also made to her niece?"]}
