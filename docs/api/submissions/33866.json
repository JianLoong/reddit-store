She's right- the house should be made safe for the baby.   YTA if you're willing to compromise your grandkids safety because you're frustrated with your daughter. \n\nMy opinion?  This is a time for everyone to grow the hell up and use your big kid words. You need to sit down with her and figure out exactly what her finances are, and what kind of plan can be set in place to get her the hell out of your house. You, your wife, your kid ALL need to come together and compromise, and figure it out.  \n\nIf the kid is staying, the house must be made safe.

So you'll still end up needing to childproof your house.", "YTA, she could be the most responsible parent in the world  but 1 year olds learning to walk have no concept of danger and fall over a lot.

No, sir, it would give Katie the impression that you actually care about Jesse's safety and well-being.

Your daughter shows good mothering instincts to want to create a safe environment for her child.  You obviously have a lot of resentment towards your daughter and grandchild and need to go get some therapy. Also, stop charging your daughter rent, so she can actually save up to move.

It will be your fault your only grandchild got hurt, and you\u2019ll have to live with that for the rest of your life. Baby proofing, by design, can usually be removed without leaving any marks, so it can all come off when they leave. \n\nAs for getting them out of the house - start charging her rent, and put some or all of the money aside to get a deposit together for her.", "this is laughable. you\u2019re mad at your daughter and taking it out on the safety of your grandson. YTA dude.", "INFO: Where do you think the baby is gonna spend his time when your daughter is moved out into her own place and at work?", "YTA for putting your grandson at risk, full stop. \n\nHowever you're NTA for how you feel. Your daughter is upsetting your plans for this period of your life, you're supposed to be done with parenting and grandparenting instead (way more fun). \n\nBut your real issue is with your daughter for having no plan for the future. I personally think it's kind of disrespectful of her to not even sit down and talk to about it. You need to talk to her, but you need to talk to your wife first. I'm not sure she's on the same page as you.", "YTA because it is an issue of safety for the kid. I also think you\u2019re being a bit shortsighted and shooting your self in the foot a bit here - having a house that ISN\u2019T baby proofed is going to ultimately create a lot more work for whoever is watching the kid - probably your wife. It\u2019s much easier to get stuff done around the house when the baby can safely wander semi-supervised behind you then it is for both the baby and caretaker to be sequestered to just the nursery. \n\nI see your point about being upset that Katie is spending money on extra stuff instead of saving\u2026 why not charge her rent and save it on her behalf for a place? Seems like she needs a little help in this area. \n\nTLDR - let Katie baby proof the house so you don\u2019t create even more extra workload for your wife and find an actual solution to helping her get on her own two feet without being petty.", "YTA for risking your grandchild's safety because you are mad about something else.
