She's right- the house should be made safe for the baby.   YTA if you're willing to compromise your grandkids safety because you're frustrated with your daughter. \n\nMy opinion?  This is a time for everyone to grow the hell up and use your big kid words. You need to sit down with her and figure out exactly what her finances are, and what kind of plan can be set in place to get her the hell out of your house. You, your wife, your kid ALL need to come together and compromise, and figure it out.  \n\nIf the kid is staying, the house must be made safe.

So you'll still end up needing to childproof your house.", "YTA, she could be the most responsible parent in the world  but 1 year olds learning to walk have no concept of danger and fall over a lot.

No, sir, it would give Katie the impression that you actually care about Jesse's safety and well-being.

You obviously have a lot of resentment towards your daughter and grandchild and need to go get some therapy. Also, stop charging your daughter rent, so she can actually save up to move.

It will be your fault your only grandchild got hurt, and you\u2019ll have to live with that for the rest of your life. Baby proofing, by design, can usually be removed without leaving any marks, so it can all come off when they leave. \n\nAs for getting them out of the house - start charging her rent, and put some or all of the money aside to get a deposit together for her.", "this is laughable. you\u2019re mad at your daughter and taking it out on the safety of your grandson.

Your daughter is upsetting your plans for this period of your life, you're supposed to be done with parenting and grandparenting instead (way more fun). \n\nBut your real issue is with your daughter for having no plan for the future. I personally think it's kind of disrespectful of her to not even sit down and talk to about it. You need to talk to her, but you need to talk to your wife first. I'm not sure she's on the same page as you.", "YTA because it is an issue of safety for the kid. I also think you\u2019re being a bit shortsighted and shooting your self in the foot a bit here - having a house that ISN\u2019T baby proofed is going to ultimately create a lot more work for whoever is watching the kid - probably your wife. It\u2019s much easier to get stuff done around the house when the baby can safely wander semi-supervised behind you then it is for both the baby and caretaker to be sequestered to just the nursery. \n\nI see your point about being upset that Katie is spending money on extra stuff instead of saving\u2026 why not charge her rent and save it on her behalf for a place? Seems like she needs a little help in this area. \n\nTLDR - let Katie baby proof the house so you don\u2019t create even more extra workload for your wife and find an actual solution to helping her get on her own two feet without being petty.", "YTA for risking your grandchild's safety because you are mad about something else.

No decent human being wants a young child to get hurt that could have been prevented with some simple actions.", "I'm also reading this story and thinking the wife is ready to pick the grandchild over the husband.", "OP said the child has a room to play in. That\u2019s perfectly reasonable. When the child is in the common areas, his mother should be watching him.", "But the baby will be perfectly safe if they put a gate on the door to the nursery?", "This person parents/grandparents.", "This+++", "Yup, I'd be baby proofing the house myself, and then grandfather proofing the locks on the front door until he got the hint.\n\nYes, I'm that asshole. He could throw a fit, I wouldn't care.\n\nSmart locks FTW", ">YTA if you have a baby living with you, you need to make the house safe.\n\nOr even if you're going to have a baby over regularly.  We're the go-to babysitters for my little cousin, and when she was very young, we semi-babyproofed the house (socket plugs, etc.).  \n\nHe's trying to force the issue, but he'll feel terrible if something were to happen.  I get he wants it to be uncomfortable for his daughter to nudge her out, but even if they just babysit often they should babyproof.", "Clothes for her child & giving him fucking rent.", "Sure as hell hope not Ops house.....", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I don't think he had much say on this situation", "OP doesn\u2019t even refer to the kid *as* his grandchild.", " She does pay rent, I bet if she wasn't paying rent she could have been saving that money to move out.", "Im also betting OPs wife isn\u2019t bothered because she knows as soon as daughter can move out she will and contact with their grandchild will be limited due to OP being an ass. Saying a baby has a nursery to learn to walk. Even I, someone who very much dislikes small children, knows they need more space than that. I\u2019m better OP was a seen and not heard type of parent and his daughter already has plans to get out when she can to avoid the same future for her child. All the \u201cneedless spending\u201d is actually things she needs (new cloths coz duh she had a baby, new phone because let\u2019s face it having an outdated phone is unreliable so getting an upgrade while she can better afford it is smart) and she\u2019s getting it done while she can before getting TF out of there.", "[removed]", "There was a time when people just watched their babies instead of putting them in padded rooms.", "Sounds like he cares less about his grandchild than he does about his daughter.", "Anyone born before about 1990 will have lived in a home like that. About the only babyproofing that would have been done is a gate on the stairs.", "Yeah, I mean I get it and I don't get it. I never seriously hurt myself inside the house. No one I knew did. Maybe gates would be okay to keep the kid falling down the stairs, but corner things just seem like overkill. You can keep dangerous liquids out of reach as well (and teach your kids as soon as they're old enough what things are dangerous and why, and what might happen, instead of just saying don't do that).  \n\nNow send me outside, and I totally did all kinds of things. I liked to go and explore nature. Dumb things can happen that you just can't protect myself. I mean I grew up in Connecticut, we had a very steep driveway, one year it became a bit slick, but slushy. I slipped, fell and sprained my wrist. Or the time I was riding a bicycle down that same driveway, and being a kid decided it would be a great idea to my hands off the handlebars near the bottom to show off to my parents, who watched me as I slammed into a tree. Sprained a wrist then too, the same wrist. \n\nHell I mean my sister beating me up when I was little caused more damage than corners ever did. \n\nThere are certain ways you can be too protective. And in certain ways, you're just putting your kid on a path to not be able to function in the world by being overprotective. I'm not really sure what this is.", "I mostly agree with you, but there's no way a toddler in the house doesn't create extra work for him even if he actively avoids it.", "Can you guarantee that Jesse will be just fine? There\u2019s a reason baby proofing exists. It\u2019s because a lot of babies and toddlers were getting hurt. Yet you want to roll the dice with someone else\u2019s child? Make it make sense.", "I second this. My youngest (almost 3) has been to my parents house twice and they baby proofed before she was born.", "Or getting an electric dog fence to keep the baby inside the nursery.", "I guess he didn\u2019t raise his daughter, provide for her, or pay for the house they\u2019re living in? \ud83d\ude02 TF", "How's she supposed to do much as make him or herself food or a bottle of he's opening up every cabinet and running around full speed with no safety precautions? Chances are good this home is open concept like most now which means if she's in the kitchen she's also in the dining and living area and maybe even entryways... Even if they decide to not use cabinet locks etc then they need to put everything he can get into into different locations or he's in danger while his mom makes a bottle! Or, she puts him in a high chair and let's him scream the house down when she does anything? But then her dad here would say she's not doing chores and it's lazy and hey baby screams all the time...", "It's incredibly important for child development for the baby to have a safe home they can explore freely. Part of that includes baby proofing. If a baby spends their toddler years constantly being told 'no, you can't go in there. No, you can't touch that' they can't develop confidence and independence in a healthy way. Locking a baby in a room for its only experience of safe exploration is an insane take. \n\nDo you think mothers just sit on the couch with eagle eyes on their babies 24/7 in their own homes?", "Getting a dependent while you ARE a dependent is a perfectly reasonable thing to be upset at someone about. That she was an adult makes it worse, not better- adults know better, they aren\u2019t teens who can\u2019t access condoms or think you can jump up and down afterwards to avoid pregnancy.", "Automatic yta when an OP edits out relevant information that makes them look bad. Given the context, pretty disgusting.", "What *\u201dmessage\u201d* does baby-proofing send?!

Heck, my grandmother told me the baby proofed for my parents who are in their late 60s. Hell, in pioneer days, babies were dressed in long dresses so they were less mobile....which is a form of baby proofing.", "There was a time when more babies died every year from poisoning, too, because they got into cabinets. \n\nYes, you should watch your baby. A playpen can help if you need to go to the bathroom or shower, but sounds like OP would not want a playpen either.\n\nOnce babies become mobile, you have to watch them every moment, or put them somewhere safe they can\u2019t get out of, in order to turn your back to do dishes or brush your hair. Baby proofing light sockets and cabinets is an extra layer of protection.", "Actually they left them in tiny play pens", "And baby proofing exists because plenty of other kids in that era and earlier eras died from things easily preventable with a bit of care from their parents in baby proofing.", "I'm sorry but that's the choice you make when you decide to have children or did you make your kids pay you back?", "No, its really not reasonable", "We have no idea under what circumstances she got pregnant. Also nice christian love you have there. /s on the second part", "Also they'd literally tie the baby to the person watching them so they couldn't run away...", "So many of these commentors have never seen how FAST a mobile baby is. I don't have kids and was shocked two years ago to see how quickly my niece could army crawl at 8 months. With three adults watching her (two sitting on the floor with her and one standing), in the 5 seconds my sister and I looked away, she was nearly to the top of the basement stairs. My BIL had to lunge and grab the waistband of her pants to stop her. And then he felt awful because he had just come upstairs and forgotten to close the gate.", "Which OP also would not want in his home. More things in HIS home."]}
