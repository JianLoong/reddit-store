I want running to continue growing as a competitive activity and as a just-for-fun hobby. I encourage and support newcomers to running, but recently I encountered a situation where I felt gate-keeping was necessary. My sister-in-law got into running last year, and she absolutely fell in-love with it as well. Since I am also a runner, I decided I could connect with her on the topic. I wanted to hear about her runs, her progress, and maybe offer some helpful guidance if she wanted it. So, at a family gathering I ask her about running.\n\nAfter a bit of conversation, she mentioned to me that she ran a marathon. I was quite surprised, she ran a marathon after only getting into running a year ago. That is amazing, what incredible dedication and drive (I thought to myself). I was about to praise her for this incredible accomplishment, but then she explain this \"marathon\" in detail. It was a virtual marathon that she started late last year and apparently completed this year. Basically it was an app based event where you tally up your running distances until you reach 42.2km (26.2 miles). I chuckled slightly and told her that its great she totalled 42.2km in that time-frame, but it doesn't count as a marathon. I told her that a marathons have time limits for completion, usually 6 to 8 hours. If they didn't, then I could claim multiple ultra-marathons via the aggregate distances I ran in my life. Its disingenuous and in my opinion, undermines those who have actually ran a marathon. \n\nShe didn't take this well, she called me an asshole, a bully, an elitist, and a few other things. I apologized for upsetting her, but I stand by what I said, she didn't run a marathon. I didn't press the subject at all and left it at that, she wouldn't speak to me the rest of the gathering. My wife agrees with me, despite not being a runner herself, she said her sister overreacted. Their mother said that I should have just let my sister-in-law believe that she ran a marathon. Maybe, I don't know....she is 23 years old, without any impairments. Validating her \"marathon\" would feel similar to lying to a child to boost their confidence.

She didn't run a marathon.\n\nAccording to apple health, over the past 26 weeks, I've averaged 5.1miles a day.  Does that mean I'm walking a marathon every 6 days?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous.", "This is NTA all the way!  I\u2019m stunned at these Y T A responses.\n\nYou were simply correcting her.  It\u2019s completely acceptable, expected even, for someone experienced in a sport or hobby to explain the parlance to beginners. \n\nWhat she did is nothing close to running a marathon. And claiming that she ran a marathon diminishes the accomplishment of everyone who actually _has_ run one. \n\nIt would be like if I claimed to have climbed Mount Everest just because I climbed 30k in elevation over a hundred hikes this year. Ridiculous. And any such claim, made to an actual mountain climber, should be immediately (and politely) corrected. \n\nYour motivation was not to tear her down or ridicule her. It was to simply correct the misunderstanding of a beginner in your sport. Completely the right thing to do, as agreeing with her would have even been a bit dishonest. She simply overreacted.\n\nEdit:  Had to change first line so NTA came first to ensure votes got counted correctly.  Thanks for the clarification in the responses!", "NTA\n\nSaying \"I ran a marathon\" implies that you completed the whole distance in the same day - not that you did a mile a day on an installment plan.\n\nOtherwise I climb Mount Everest every year on my stairs.", "INFO. \n\nYou are right and she is wrong. That is pretty cut and dry. However, that doesn't mean you didn't handle that specific scenario like an asshole, if that makes sense.", "Bit confused about peoples judgements here, but personally i'm gonna say NTA, op.  \nYeah, it was wrong to laugh, but you did apologize for hurting her feelings afterwards. At the end of the day you just explained what an actual marathon was to her, and she way overreacted. As you said, validating what she thought of as a marathon is like lying to a child to to boost their confidence.", "NTA \n\nShe didn't run a marathon. Full stop lol. \n\nAnyone who thinks otherwise is just living in fantasy land where you make the facts up as you go. Goofy.", "NTA.  I agree with you 100%.  \n\nEither your SIL genuinely did not know what a marathon is, or she knew yet nevertheless decided to misrepresent her accomplishment.  In either case, you were right to correct her.  If she didn't know, then you helped educate her on a key term in our sport.  If she did know, she should be called out for the reasons you gave.  \n\nAs an endurance runner myself, I find her statement embarassing.  The better approach is to say that she \"ran a marathon distance over X days.\"", "NTA.  My dad used to run marathons... he even ran 3 Boston Marathons you have to qualify for.  He ran 10 total, he's in his mid 70s now and still in pretty damn good shape.  I used to run before I started having knee problems... adding up my 5km here and 2 km there until they reached 42 is nowhere near what my dad did.  He ran marathons... I did not!", "Your chuckle wasn't nice but you're not wrong. It's not a marathon.", "NTA! I know lots of marathon runners- I\u2019m offended on their behalf. If she would have said \u201ci got this new app and it\u2019s tracking me through the length of a marathon. It\u2019s great motivation\u201d that would have been different. She is phrasing it the way she is to get the accolades with none of the work. If any of my friends/family told me that i would have been making jokes at their ridiculousness.", "NTA. Sorry to break it to the \"feelings over facts\" crew, but trying to claim to have \"run a marathon\", when you did not in fact RUN a MARATHON, but in reality ran 1 mile 26 times ( or what ever breakdown she used, because, apparantly it took her half a year! ), is ludicrious. I'm from the Boston area, and I have friends who ran the Boston Marathon, and that shit is no joke, you have to qualify, you have to raise a ton of money, there's steep hills, and shitty weather. If someone was to tell one of them, \"I ran a marathon too\", and explained it the way your SIL did, they would have spit out their Iced Dunkin's coffee while laughing hysterically.", "26 miles in a year? She could literally have done that just walking to the fridge and toilet. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nYou already mentioned in other comments that the chuckling was out of place (I\u2019d probably smile inappropriately; like a WTF is this person saying smile). I would also correct someone in this situation. Apply this to other situations and it sounds even more ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019ve benched 250 lbs. Over the last month. In increments of 10. \n\nI\u2019ve won the lottery! I had the right numbers if you compile all my picks this month.\n\nI won at Jeopardy! I knew all the answers!\n\nI served in the military! But I injured myself in basic training and got medically retired. \n\nSorry, I\u2019m not good at thinking up examples. Think of an accomplishment or goal of yours. Something that you had to work and struggle towards. And someone just coming in and claiming it as their own without having actually done it.", "NTA at all, the Y T A responses are way off base. Your SIL 'ran a marathon,' in chunks, over the course of a year - there's nothing wrong with that, but it is *not* the same as powering through 26.2 miles in one go. She's 23, not 3, her reaction to what sounds like a friendly factual correction is stupid and immature.", "I\u2019m would not have been able to stay quiet either. There are a lot of people who pretend to have accomplished things that other people have actually worked very hard to actually accomplish. It makes me angry. While your SIL saying she ran a marathon doesn\u2019t hurt anyone, when everyone who ran 26.2 miles in a year says that it starts to erode away the actual accomplishment of running a marathon. NTA", "NTA. By her logic, most people could brag about completing a few marathons a year (total walking distance).", "NTA. She did not run a marathon.", "If she ran it over a year, that\u2019s less than a kilometre a week. She did not run a marathon. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nSomeone once said they were training for a marathon. I later found out it was a 5km option that was part of the race weekend.\n\nNot a marathon.\n\nClaiming you've ran a marathon when you actually did a smaller distance race is just discrediting the achievement of people who HAVE run marathons.\n\nI've ran 4 half marathons. I don't say I've run 4 marathons or 2 marathons.\n\nBy your SILs understanding, I ran like 2 marathons a month in peak training season \ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA.", " NTA. Running a marathon is a huge accomplishment that requires a lot of effort to pull off. She\u2019s trying to claim that when she hasn\u2019t actually put in the effort. You can run this up a little hyperbolically to see how insulting it is. Example: saying \u201cI got an Olympic gold medal in running\u201d when you downloaded an app sponsored by the Olympics that gives an electronic \u201cmedal\u201d for running X distance in a month is totally absurd. \nShe\u2019s doing the same thing.", "NTA for telling her it\u2019s not the same thing. But your attitude is bad.", "What a ridiculous comment section. A marathon is a specific length. I'm not able to lift 10 tons, just because I have lifted 10 tons in the span of a year. I didn't write Kafka's Transformation, just because I have used all the words in my life, which make up the whole book.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Why does her mother prefer that she remain ignorant?", "NTA, if she goes in any running circle they will start asking her time and which race. They would all be like \u201coh yeah a marathon\u201d *changed subject to avoid awkwardness* nothing wrong with running short distance versus long distance, but be honest \n\nI\u2019m just a little 5k runner and if someone tells me they do a 5k by walking a lot everyday, I\u2019d be like uhm no. Sure she has run 26.2 miles but she hasn\u2019t been in a marathon.", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like the result of too many participation trophies to me. I\u2019m a swimmer and average a few hundred miles a year, should I claim some monumental feat?  Heck no.", "NTA, running a marathon is a great aspirational goal for a distance runner and a really impressive achievement. She could work up to it one day and she\u2019s robbing herself of that. If she one day runs a half marathon (all at once) it\u2019s like a step down before she even starts the race.", "NTA. She would have been put rin her place in a very embarrassing way if she said this to people who really ran a marathon. I have a couple friends who have and they can be very ummm snobby for lack of a better word to people who think it's easy enough for anyone to do.", "NTA - She didn\u2019t run a marathon.", "NTA.  By that standard, every person on Earth will have run several marathons before they die.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a marathon.", "Lol. But she didn\u2019t run a marathon \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nNTA", "NTA. By her standards I did a half marathon in the last 2 days", "As a marathon runner, she is way off base. Training for a marathon and completing one is something that I would gate keep as well with someone like that. She didn\u2019t run a marathon.", "I\u2019m going with a soft ESH. She probably uses the Conqueror challenges or something similar. I use them to keep me motivated and have some fun with other rubbing friends. But I also don\u2019t claim that I climbed Everest or ran the Ring Road or Hadrians Wall. You are correct that she did not run a marathon. She walked/ran the distance of a marathon over the course of the year. \n\nCould you have handled it better? Probably. I\u2019m sure there was a better way of pointing this out while still encouraging her to get out there without tearing down what she felt was an accomplishment, but yes, the way she presents it is disingenuous. At the end of the day, distances and races don\u2019t matter. Getting out there and doing something you enjoy does.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My guess is that you did not strike that balance well.\n\nIf your SIL is using these challenges to motivate herself and to chip away at a long term plan to run further each time, get fitter, etc, than having her *commitment* undermined and laughed at is going to be pretty hurtful.\n\nSure, she didn't run a marathon. But who cares? To all the people saying it cheapens the claim for people who have run a marathon, again, *who cares*? Lots of people have run marathons, it doesn't make you a better person than anybody else, you surely don't need validation from people recognising you as a marathon-runner?", "Genuinely amazed that you think semantics are the important thing here when she was using a very common type of self motivation technique and your response was to laugh in her face and tell her she wasn't allowed to do that. You weren't an asshole for chuckling, you were the asshole for trying to undermine her effort and to gatekeep her right to use a word to describe the distance she's run AND for dragging multiple other people into the argument afterwards.", "You know you posted asking for opinions, right?", "These people are all over the running community. They think they are gods gift to earth because they ran a marathon and purposely seek out casual runners to humiliate them for not being hard core enough.", "This subreddit is nuts, unless you're as delicate as someone explaining to a misled 6-year-old orphan that their parents won't be coming back to life, you're branded an asshole.\n\nSome statements are so ludicrous that they deserve to be laughed at. OP lightly chuckling at her does her a *massive favour*, if she tells the story of how she ran a marathon at a party or a job interview she's going to be annihilated.\n\nLaughing at her is the only way to communicate just how phenomenally dumb her statement is.", "100% AGREE", "That idea is a crock of horseshit. She believes something that's incorrect, so she should be corrected, full stop. This is some namby pamby bs, and is why people in America are so fucking stupid. Nobody bothers to correct them, because it's seen as \"impolite,\" and now they think they're top shit, when really they're morons; it's why there are so many arrogant, yet ignorant, AHs in this country; it's why our politics are so shitty and why education standards have plummeted. All because people \"want a connection\"", "I will no longer be commenting on your posts (for the night) as an unbiased observer of this comment thread I have become offended.", "For real, like why even post of Reddit if you're going to talk shit about Redditors\n\nOP you're one of us", "Ya op sounds like they don\u2019t get invited to parties with their attitude.", "Correct. She shouldn't be saying in that moment that she ran a marathon...which any normal person would agree is really impressive.\nAnd she shouldn't continue telling that to other people. It is ridiculous.\n\nShe is wrong and she likely overreacted to being corrected. \n\nShe needs to grow up in regards to exaggerating her own accomplishments AND acknowledging when she is incorrect about something.", "Oh for sure, but this girl also *knew* she was lying. All other employees admitted they were cashiers/on the sales floor, but she insisted up and down that \u201cshe was a model\u201d if anyone asked. \n\nShe also claimed she \u201cdid a lot of photoshoots\u201d and \u201cneeded to get headshots\u201d for this job.", "I mean It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to be irritated by it. Completing a marathon is a HUGE accomplishment both mentally and physically. People calling anything that isn\u2019t a marathon a marathon is  honestly not respecting how big that accomplishment is.", "I agree!", "I use an app called Finch. Your bird throws digit confetti when you mark a goal as complete. You also get other things for completing goals and can dress your bird up and decorate their room. It's less weird than it sounds. There's a paid version (worth it imo) and a free version.", "Abercrombie was/is notorious for hiring 'models' as cashiers and customer service. Even if everyone knows their job is actually 'cashier', their job title is model. The photoshoot thing may have been exaggerated, but the head shot might not.", "I got severe pancreatitis caused by gallstones 2 months ago, 5 days in ICU and 3 weeks in hospital, the last 5 weeks spent clawing back my strength and stamina. The ppl I went to the same meetings with knew I was sick and I didn't get so much as a DM. Other friends, including those I met in AA who have since found recovery platforms that suited them better, kept in regular contact and came to visit me but my AA 'friends'... crickets. I always knew there was a strong element of self pity and self absorption, but I found that to be really illuminating. So in hindsight, I'm not surprised there's a strong culture of 'but I'm really 2 years sober'. No, dude, you've got a month up. Own it. You'll never get to 2 years if you don't take an honest inventory.\n\nAnd congrats on the 8 months, feel free to DM me if you ever want a chat \u263a\ufe0f.", "Congrats on staying strong! I'm about a month in now, and people keep telling me to go to AA but the one meeting I went to just felt so cultish and self absorbed and maybe it was just this group, but they seemed a little *too* supportive, if that makes sense. Like, one guy admitted to relapsing and all anyone did was pat him on the back and tell him that it's a disease and not his fault he's having such a hard time. Which isn't bad, per say, but I feel like the point of these programs is to help people stay accountable for their actions. I personally need a setting where people are going to tell me, yup, you fucked up. Now get back on track and do what you're supposed to, no excuses. Telling me that it's okay and that I tried won't do anything but allow me to pretend that relapsing isn't that big of a deal, when it is.", "Both are true! In her case, it was absolutely exaggerated. Abercrombie is shady AF, but no one else who worked at that particular store knew anything about headshots. I can almost guarantee they hired her \u201cas a model\u201d (even though she *knew* she really wasn\u2019t), and she ran with this lie so hard that people started asking questions, so she made up even more lies, like claiming they \u201cdid headshots\u201d and \u201cgave her photoshoots.\u201d \n\nShe was also the type of person who lied about/exaggerated everything. She once watched a movie and the credits happened to feature someone with her surname, so she told everyone her uncle was the cinematographer. \n\nIn this case, Abercrombie got what the wanted\u2014 someone so desperate to sustain the lie of \u201cbeing a model\u201d that she worked for a pittance.", "\ud83d\ude06"]}
