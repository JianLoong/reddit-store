Its almost like your car keeps trying to warn you that you need to fill it up, or something. Of course, I'm sure that your car has none of these helpful tools, and there was no possible way that you could have remembered that you needed to fill your gas tank, right?", "YTA and fuck your feelings. You are 20 years old. You must be a special kind of stupid to just forget to put gas in your car. And to top it off you forgot your phone . But of course your solution to your own bullshit is to cry in your vehicle on a highway, where you could have caused a massive pile up. All becuase YOU were to damm lazy to fill up your gas tank.  \n\nThen your solution to all this is to cry. \n\nThen you got into a vehicle with men seriously you are aware that you could have been raped or even killed. \n\nYou are a massive AH", "You're NAH but your brother has a point, you left yourself in a very vulnerable situation, thankfully these men were nice, however, not everyone is and this could have ended up horribly.

Most of us do make a lot of dumb mistakes in our lives. I remember being young and coming close to running out of gas; hopefully it won\u2019t happen for you again. \n\nAs for accepting help getting your car off the street - how great that someone stopped to help and how else would you get out of the way? Years ago I pulled over when an elderly woman was sitting in a car stopped in the middle of the road. She had run out of gas, so my teenage son and I pushed her car out of the street to a safe place. Her son was already on his way so that was good. I\u2019ve helped strangers jump their cars in parking lots. I\u2019ve had strangers help me when my car got stuck in the snow. It\u2019s honestly a great thing when we can help each other out. \n\nAs for getting in the truck with the men, that was not the safest choice for sure. I would urge more caution in the future. And, I will also say that I have at times also trusted strangers and been very grateful for their help, so I get it. But please do be more careful. \n\nGood luck, be safe, and keep learning.

My key ring has my AAA tag on it which has a handy phone number to call if I break down (because I don't run out of gas).  The Department of Transportation in my state even has a number (I think ours is 511) to call for help on the roadways.

This is someone who could not manage the basic skills needed to be trusted to safely maintain and operate a vehicle. (Does she even maintain her vehicle *at all*? She can't even manage gas...) If her brother hides the car keys from her and makes her use public transit from now on, I'll call him a hero.

OP chose to let her car run out of gas in the center lane.
