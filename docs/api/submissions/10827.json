Its almost like your car keeps trying to warn you that you need to fill it up, or something. Of course, I'm sure that your car has none of these helpful tools, and there was no possible way that you could have remembered that you needed to fill your gas tank, right?", "YTA and fuck your feelings. You are 20 years old. You must be a special kind of stupid to just forget to put gas in your car. And to top it off you forgot your phone . But of course your solution to your own bullshit is to cry in your vehicle on a highway, where you could have caused a massive pile up. All becuase YOU were to damm lazy to fill up your gas tank.  \n\nThen your solution to all this is to cry. \n\nThen you got into a vehicle with men seriously you are aware that you could have been raped or even killed. \n\nYou are a massive AH", "You're NAH but your brother has a point, you left yourself in a very vulnerable situation, thankfully these men were nice, however, not everyone is and this could have ended up horribly.

Most of us do make a lot of dumb mistakes in our lives. I remember being young and coming close to running out of gas; hopefully it won\u2019t happen for you again. \n\nAs for accepting help getting your car off the street - how great that someone stopped to help and how else would you get out of the way? Years ago I pulled over when an elderly woman was sitting in a car stopped in the middle of the road. She had run out of gas, so my teenage son and I pushed her car out of the street to a safe place. Her son was already on his way so that was good. I\u2019ve helped strangers jump their cars in parking lots. I\u2019ve had strangers help me when my car got stuck in the snow. It\u2019s honestly a great thing when we can help each other out. \n\nAs for getting in the truck with the men, that was not the safest choice for sure. I would urge more caution in the future. And, I will also say that I have at times also trusted strangers and been very grateful for their help, so I get it. But please do be more careful. \n\nGood luck, be safe, and keep learning.

My key ring has my AAA tag on it which has a handy phone number to call if I break down (because I don't run out of gas).  The Department of Transportation in my state even has a number (I think ours is 511) to call for help on the roadways.

You couldn't call for help because you were too irresponsible to answer your phone and your reaction was to just sit in your car and cry and not realize you were blocking traffic.\n\nAdd to that the fact that you got in a car with strangers and let them pay for your gas after they helped you (you probably forgot your wallet too). \n\nAnd it sounds like you have a history of this kind of behavior, hence your user name. If your precious feewings are so hurt by your brothers comments then use this as your wakeup call to grow up and prove him wrong", "YTA, I have autism and adhd so I forget things and have to have them fit into my plan.

NTA!\n\nWas this completely ill advised? YES. Was this entirely preventable? ABSOLUTELY. Does it make you an AH? No. No it does not. \n\nIt's great that you were able to find some helpful people but your brother is right that getting into cars with strange men is risky. Take measures to ensure this does not happen again. If you know you have the tendency to put things off and forget, then the time you need to fill your tank is when it is HALF EMPTY. Not totally empty. HALF. Never let your tank be less than half full.", "YTA for running out of gas when you knew well ahead of time you were low AND blocking traffic like that.

Tony from the Jackson Michigan area, if you\u2019re somehow on Reddit, thanks again for rescuing my dumb ass eleven years ago. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole for accepting help, though it was a dangerous thing to do without a phone that could be used to trace you if it hadn\u2019t actually been safe. You definitely need to be careful in situations like this, and try not to put yourself in that position again. \n\nI see that you\u2019re about the age of my students OP, so, from someone who has been there AND works with people your age, you\u2019re going to need to take this as a learning opportunity to do better.\n\nIs there something that\u2019ll help you remember to check your gas? I\u2019d suggest a phone reminder for enough time before you leave the house to get gas, or leaving notes on the things you\u2019ll use at school/work like a notebook or water bottle (since you left your phone by mistake this time, that could be a good backup).  \n\nWe\u2019re all human and we all fuck up, but fuck ups like yours and mine, when I was younger, can be deadly for more people than just us.

As someone who does not like the gas gauge to get below 3/4, I will never understand how people can \"forget\" to put gas in the car when the needle is on empty .....I mean, it takes just a few minutes ....", "And people judge me for being terrified of driving and talk down to me. But the truth is, even though this story sounded so dumb to me, I have to remember that those of us with executive disfunction accidentally do things like this a lot so I chose not to do something as risky and dangerous as driving with my mental disability.", "I legitimately don't know how people can forget to fill up a gas tank to the point they run out in the middle of a road. Like I have ADHD that went undiagnosed and untreated for the first 34 of my 35 years and a have piss poor short term memory and I have never once run out of gas. I've had the E light turn on a couple times, but most modern cars [in America, that I know of. I do not know all cars] you still have an emergency reservoir of gas after the E light comes on, specifically so that you can immediately locate the next nearest gas station.

This is a long series of bad choices and a lack of awareness that is terrifying in a driver. If you were surprised that stopping in the middle lane would be problematic, I'm sorry but you should not be driving. Having memory and attention span issues doesn't make you an asshole, but endangering others on the road absolutely does.\n\nETA consider getting evaluated for ADHD. I have friends who said a diagnosis and taking appropriate meds was absolutely life-changing for them in the best way. Might be worth a shot!

Once it starts to yell at you to get gas you should get gas immediately (and usually there\u2019s a decent buffer to find a gas station after it starts to ding as I know from my sibling who does push it sometimes when it comes to getting gas)\n\nI\u2019m going to give you the same advice as I gave my sibling if you have a fairly normal schedule pick a day and make it a weekly fill up time (it doesn\u2019t matter if your gas tank isn\u2019t empty fill it on that day no matter what) and this way you should get into a good habit and not get stuck on the side of the road. \n\nAs for getting in a car with strangers, yeah your brother was right this was a bad move. They were helpful and friendly this time which is great but that\u2019s not always the case and you need to be careful. \n\nTake this and some of the other comments as a dose of reality and work to be more safe for yourself and those around you.
