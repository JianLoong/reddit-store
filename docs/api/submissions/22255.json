There has been a long history of favoritism for her from my parents, but they never own up to it. I had to take out loans and work my way through school. She tried to go to school on their dime but ended up working in construction instead. (Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, just demonstrating that they were willing to pay for her but not for me). \nMy parents justification has always been that sister just needs more help than I do. That I\u2019m more independent and self-sufficient. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they have helped me by buying me groceries during school and filling up my car on visits home, which I\u2019m grateful for. They did not have to spend any money on me and I don\u2019t feel entitled to it. I\u2019m more upset that there is clear favoritism shown by the lavish amounts of monetary help given. \n\nFlash forward to today. I\u2019m graduated working in social work. I get paid decently but have been struggling with my massive amount of student loan debt. My partner of 5 years and I break even just about every month. We are trying our best to get married, buy a house, and have a life together, but feel crushed and as if it may never happen due to my student loan debt. \n\nMy sister, who has been living at home on my parents dime got pregnant by cheating on her boyfriend with his friend. She has recently been gifted two acres of property by my parents and they have started to help pay for the construction of the two story home. She has so far picked out brand new appliances, new hardwood floors, and new furniture all on the dime of my parents. \nNot only am I angry that she seems to be wringing my parents dry on this new home, but it\u2019s just simply the principle of wanting to help her over me. I would have to work the rest of my life to earn a house half as nice as the one she\u2019s getting for free. I can\u2019t start my family because of my debt, but they are willing to give her a huge economic advantage because I can\u2019t afford to reproduce. \n\nIn bringing this up to my parents, I was told that if I\u2019m not going to be supportive of my sister I don\u2019t have to come back. I tried telling them I am grateful for what they have done for me and that I don\u2019t want their money, but I feel like their willingness to give my sister whatever she wants is a clear demonstration of their favoritism and I don\u2019t know how to feel. \n\nI get they can spend their money how they want to, and I don\u2019t want my sisters baby to go without a house. And I could be TA for bringing it up. I just feel like their continued favoritism of my sister makes it hard for me to want to be around them. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689363808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zq1iw/aita_for_calling_out_my_parents_on_their/", "score": 277, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly at this point I'd straight up tell them you can't afford a child and you're potentially putting that part of your life on hold/forgoing parenthood entirely. If they didn't offer to help you out, whether you wanted to take them up on it or not, you would be able to unequivocally say they are showing favoritism. Whether or not they wanted to hear it, it would be totally appropriate to bring up.", "NTA\n\nFavoritism like this is poison to a family. The Golden Child, then the scapegoat, is such a common dynamic. My brother was the Golden Child - he would do terrible things, all was forgiven. Let me assure you that was not the case with me.\n\nI can only say the best thing I did was to reduce contact with my family, put them on an \"information diet\" (they didn't find out what I was doing, with whom, or when), and gave up expecting anything except that my brother would get 100% of everything.\n\nIt's not fun or easy, But you have to withdraw, especially emotionally. I guarantee you your sister will at some point have an issue with them, and it will be VERY VERY hard not to say *\"I told you so - you were enabling her every step of the wa*y\". But you'll have to.\n\nYour family are basically emotional vampires right now - you just have to pull back, smile and say \"*isn't that interesting*?\" or \"*you don't say*!\" and gray rock them. \n\nIf you can, maybe see a therapist. It's not easy to see your parents fawn all over a sibling. It took mine decades to realize my brother was, actually, the jerk I had always pointed out - but they just never wanted me to say it. Even if I do today, they'll try to sweep it under the rug like they (my parents) are the only ones who see my brother for who he is, and everyone else thinks he's Some Really Great Guy.", "NTA \nYou\u2019re a social worker, I too am in social work so i know how hard you work and how smart you are. \n\nWhat does your social work knowledge tell you to do? My instincts tell me that yours and your sisters placement or ages in the family have a lot to do with your \u2018independence and ability\u2019 being used as a shield by your parents for their comparative neglect of you and molly coddling of the younger sibling, it\u2019s not uncommon for the older sibling to be treated like either a golden child or to be sidelined for the new baby.\n\nI would maybe try one more conversation where you share that you would like to own a home and start a family, but can\u2019t because your parents won\u2019t help you out despite you helping yourself as much as possible, and that your sister is helpless because she\u2019s encouraged to be, there is no incentive for her to be successful like you because she can see that in this family the more successful you are the less assistance you get, you\u2019ve worked hard only to be saddled with debt and responsible feelings limiting you from having children, which is why she has no shame in even letting down her basic commitments in her relationship, or bringing a child into the world with nothing to give them, she isn\u2019t responsible because she\u2019s encouraged not to be, at least if you got the same then she would be motivated to get a career or less motivated to create more obligations for her parents as she would have to deal with them rather than getting more and more every time she fucks up. \n\nMy instincts tell me that your parents will always baby your sister no matter how plain or logical your argument and that in the long run you will have to choose between protecting your own mental health by cutting contact or play cognitive dissonance forever over their clear and present disinterest in helping you out or even recognising how accomplished you are. \n\nI have experienced some of the same things as you in some regards and have seen it a lot when working with families, I\u2019m the middle child and wasn\u2019t protected because I was \u2018difficult and street smart\u2019 in reality I was just neglected and had to find ways to survive. My parents use my perceived character traits as an excuse for being lousy, neglectful and abusive, and after years of battling to be heard by them I had to accept that I was just hiring myself, I gave up and no longer have their noise in my life, I hope your parents can see sense and don\u2019t drive you to that decision, but if they do I hope you make a decision that serves you and your future the most, best of luck.", ">My (24f) sister (21f) is pregnant by her boyfriends friend\n\nOh, your folks must be so proud.

Going no contact is an option.  Or just ask for money to help pay off student loans or money to put down on a house. If you ask directly and they say no, ask them what the difference is. If it's still the same answer, then I would still go no contact cause they really don't seem to care what you do.", "I will say NTA for bringing this up once and how you would like some additional help.\n\nHowever, I think going low to no contact with your parents might be best. Unless you're leaving out a lot of details, it's really sad that they told you that you don't have come back if you're being supportive of your sister. What you've described them giving your sister is above and beyond generous; she does need a roof over her head, but does she need a whole new house for free? Your parents are likely to not change, and it sounds like you are done with them.", "NTA, your own analysis of the situation seems correct. You have no obligation to remain in a relationship with parents who so openly and blatantly disfavor you like this. You don\u2019t owe them anything. However you choose to interact with them from here forward is up to you.", "NTA they clearly love your sister more than you. Just stay in their good books so they keep you in their will and buy a house after they pass if you can\u2019t afford it yourself", "NTA for your feelings, but if this situation is accurate, then what are you gaining by repeatedly pointing out the favoritism to your parents?  \n\n\nYou can try one more time telling them that their perception of you as \"self sufficient\" isn't accurate, especially with the amount of debt you're carrying. If they still parrot their standard excuse, what if you went low/no contact for awhile? Your parents already think you're so \"self sufficient\", so why not lean into it in terms of your relationship with them if they can't see that their actions are creating a rift?  \n\n\nYou shouldn't have to grovel for equal treatment, and it seems that groveling won't get that result anyway.", "NTA You are being blatantly disregarded by your parents.", "You're NTA for being frustrated and upset, this kind of favoritism can be so demoralizing. That said, it's not clear what you were trying to get from this conversation with your parents - did you want them to offer you money? Or support your sister less? I ask because parents who show favoritism can really struggle to see it from the outside, and without a concrete request for some kind of change, they're likely to just feel defensive and helpless in the face of your complaint. If you don't want to be around them, you certainly don't have to be. But if you do want to have a relationship with them, and you want them to change their behavior in some way to make that possible, you should make it really clear what kind of change you need.", "NAH\nThey are entitled to financially help your sister and think you're fine. Your sister is entitled to take advantage of whoever is willing to help. And your entitled to not think it's fair.\n\nBut worry not! When everyone is looking for Auntie and Uncle to babysit.... You can tell them you can't afford to, you have to work all the time since you've got too much debt to pay back. If that were to some how change, maybe you could take time to help.", "OP - YTA.\n\nRepeat after me - \"it's not my money.  It's my parents' money.  They can spend however they like.  It's none of my business.\"   Rinse.  Repeat.\n\nYou can feel whatever way you like about the situation, and there is nothing wrong with that.  You crossed the line at presuming you can tell your parents how they feel (the principal of wanting to help her over me) and insinuate how they should be spending their money.\n\nIt is NONE of your business.\n\nStop fantasizing about what you can do with your parents' money and stop making the relationship transactional.  You won't win.  And you will be sorely hurt when that realization hits you fully.\n\nIf you want to cut contact, do it.  If they come to you asking why, tell them.  But realize you created this situation, too.  I am going yo be very blunt now ...\n\nYou have a degree in a field that doesn't pay well.  You have a load of student debt that *you* took out.  Did your parents hold your feet to the fire and make you sign the loan papers?  Did you bother to look at the cost of attendance at the school you chose to attend?  Did you look at the average salary of what people in your field make when starting out?  Did you do the math to figure out what your loan payments would be and for how long *before* you signed the loan papers?\n\nYou and your fiance both work, apparently.  If you are just getting by and you don't like living like that your options are these:  one or both of you find better paying jobs even if it isn't in your field of choice *OR* one or both of you take 2nd and even 3rd jobs. \n\nUnless you discuss your finances with your parents, they probably assume that because you have exercised neither of these options, you have got your finances under control.  Then you have a go at them for doing what they can to ensure their grandchild will have a home to come home to and is taken care if, as opposed to your fantasy grandchildren that do not yet exist for reasons they are not privy to.  How would you react in their shoes?\n\nYou see favoritism at play, where they see it as helping their grandchild.  You are an adult and can do something about your situation, but a baby cannot.  How do you expect you to win in that scenario?   They are going yo assume you are just jealous and will treat you accordingly.\n\nSo, as I said, if you are to cut contact, then do so.  Otherwise, do what *you* can do to fix your situation and stop hoping/expecting your parents to do it for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Meaning I keep in touch but im completely self reliant on myself and emotionally / mentally separated from them. If they needed anything , I\u2019d try my best to be there. But best thing I can share that has helped me heal and move on, is to know they probably won\u2019t change their mindset or the way they treat her, or even understand your point of view. So separate yourself, but don\u2019t cut them off. It\u2019s family after all, but it doesn\u2019t mean you need them in your life 24/7 , especially when they don\u2019t care if your around by making hurtful comments like that after everything you\u2019ve accomplished. Stay strong I know it must hurt but I\u2019m rooting for you OP \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe", "NTA. I\u2019d want answers too. The denial is strong in them. You sure you\u2019re not adopted?", "NTA. \n\n> I was told that if I\u2019m not going to be supportive of my sister I don\u2019t have to come back.\n\nI'm sorry... They've made their choice. You we're never a priority for them. They aren't even attempting to hide it anymore by saying something like \"need to make sure the baby has somewhere to live first but once that's sorted we can help you out too\" \n\nYou don't deserve that. You shouldn't feel bad for calling out the favouritism your parents are showing. And you won't be an ah for no longer visiting when you can't afford it.", "NTA she'll make them regret their decision eventually. She'll destroy the house and if they're dumb enough to put it in her name, she'll end up selling it", "NTA. Honey they already told you to get lost (if you can\u2019t support your sister, don\u2019t come back). They don\u2019t love or care for you. Why in Gods green earth are you still talking to them? Go NO CONTACT with them and live a happy life. No matter what you do or say, they don\u2019t care about you or your ur feelings.  Have some strength to go and never come back as they already told you to do.  Best wishes.", "NTA but it's ok to cut them off.  Please do so.  It's just not worth it.  \n\nAnd thank you for becoming a social worker.  The world needs more people like you.", "They'll never love you or treat you how you want. I'm sorry. NTA", "NTA. This is disgusting.", " Gcv gnc g fl", "Wicked cackle! Op please let the petty flow freely when that time comes.", "Fantastic advice!", "Would you lol \n\nWhat sage advice", "She has to be petty. I\u2019m so sick and tired of seeing capable women being walked all over because they think it is the right thing to do. I\u2019ve spent way too much time on this sub and it has taught me how to stop being a doormat. I don\u2019t start fights or go looking for them but I no longer feeling guilty about walking away from people and letting them reap what they sow.\nOp can have an amazing life, she just needs to drop the dead weight and not give them another thought. It is wasted mental energy.", "I reread that first sentence three times.", "Yikes, let's not give her kid a half sibling, okay?!", "NTA, girl, you have two years of publications with a problematic family, cut off contact, send them to hell and block them, your life will be less problematic, focus on the people who love you, not on the ones who give you problems", "NTA my SIL got a free house while we\u2019re told to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and stop going to Starbucks", "NTA but prepare yourself for the worst. They might not change the way they treat you and your sister will still be golden child.", "Nta but stop being a hater y'all grown now", "Me too.  Let's reward baby girl for being a cheating  s..t.", "\\*puts out cigarette on your own arm while holding eye contact\\*", "I am surprised at your parents' reaction. Who are they planning on dumping your brother and his problems on when they get older if not you?", "Oh they are going straight to OP when it happens and it WILL happen.  I just hope OP will have developed a nice titanium spine when they come begging.", "NTA.\n\nWe get it. You don't feel entitled to your parents' money and support, but you don't understand why they are so unwilling to do almost anything for you and so very, very much for your sister, comparison.\n\nIt's small consolation, but the one thing they haven't given your sister is the chance to build her self-reliance muscles - which you have in abundance.\n\nSo, I agree with the top comments. There will be a day when your sister has blown through the massive amount she's been given/ a day when your parents need physical/life management support. They are going to ask you because they wouldn't dream of burdening your sister.\n\nAnd you can look at them with clear eyes and a clear conscious and say, \"Get whatever you need from the child you gave all your money and support to. I'll be happy to reciprocate the support you gave me - a gas tank here, a grocery purchase there. I'm focused on paying off the debt I need to cover school/my home. You took care of those things for her and made her start as an adult almost free, so she should be in a great position to repay your generosity now.\"\n\nI'm going to say to you that you can build your life with your partner. Get married as simply as you can and enjoy a simple backyard potluck if that fits your budget. I'm sorry it's so much easier for your sister to have a house and start a family. The timing of those things do depend a great deal on finances. But you can start a family before you buy a house. It's pretty common for young families to start out renting and watching the pennies, but that penny-watching turns into savings and you'd be amazed at how quickly quality of life improves. I know that's not true for everyone, and the saving is not easy; but you already have the skills and the mindset. That puts you on a much better path than your peers who have more support but don't know how to save/invest/use their resources wisely. (I hope this comment was more supportive than annoying to you - I am truly rooting for you and your partner.)", "NTA \n\nBut it will be interesting when your sister gambles her new house away or loses it to a cheating scandal or something and your parents are broke and come to you!", "There's a golden child and you're not it. Now that you have absolute proof of it you can move on. Definitely NTA. If you're not going to cut them off then try low contact and know you actually have freedom from not only them but their money. Because they don't support you financially this means they cannot use their money as leverage on you. Taking away their main tool of control and manipulation will frustrate them.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry your family has treated you so unfairly.", "Nta", "NTA. They\u2019re toxic to you with the favoritism.", "This advice is all really solid.  I've gone through just about all of these steps, with great results (took a shitload of time though).\n\nEmotionally withdrawing finally got my sister to turn on my parents (instead of me, for a change).  She is *finally* imploding and I've gotten my parents to actually admit that she's kinda fucked up.  \n\nDoesn't change that she got a home loan, and I didn't.  Doesn't change that she got a car, and I didn't.  Doesn't change that they bailed her out of her credit card debt.  But now I realize she got those things because she was being coddled, and my parents didn't think she was able to do it on her own.  \n\nBut their enabling has actually fucked her up pretty good.  And because I had to be resourceful, I'm slightly less fucked up.  I can at least figure out the world a bit.  And being not-super-fucked-up is kinda priceless.", "Emotional vampires. Excellent adjectives.", "She\u2019s gotta start working on that spine now. It took me years and plenty of one step forward and two steps backwards days."]}
