His parents and siblings dote on her and gave her everything she wanted therefore she turned out extremely spoiled. \n\n2 of Dan's siblings voluntarily shared a bedroom so that a baby could have her own room. \n\nNow that we want to move in together Dan insists that Nia must come with us eventhough Dan's dad is the legal guardian. \n\nI have no problem with Nia living with us. I think we get along just fine however we were planning to buy a home and Dan insisted that we must get Nia's input as well. Nia looked at the home and asked if there are only 2 bedroom in our home? We said yes. She asked us if we are planning to have kids together. We told her that she knows that we do. She said No thank you I'll stay with my grandparents.\n\nDan freaked out and asked her why. She said she doesn't want to share a bedroom with someone.\n\nNow my finace says he won't move in with me unless we find a bigger home with more bedrooms because \"he won't go anywhere without his daughter\"\n\nWe can't afford a bigger room so this way we won't be able to move in together for who knows how long? I was furious. I told him his daughter is spoiled and he needs to parent her better instead of doing whatever she wants.

A 14 year old is not spoiled because she doesn\u2019t want to share a room with a baby. And his brothers sharing one so the baby had a nursery also didn\u2019t make her spoiled, she had no say in the matter. If you were a teenager and had to share a room with either a baby or your closer aged sibling no one is choosing the baby that cries all the time. Nia was not rude to you, she asked a question and made a decision based on the answer. Nia and Dan are a package deal and you need to be okay with that, he\u2019s not leaving her behind and that\u2019s how it should be.", "I was really on the fence, then I read some if your replies  YTA my advice is that you find someone else to be with... \n\nThis is the tip of the iceberg..  you resent your soon to be step daughter and you and your fianc\u00e9 clearly have different parenting views", "YTA\n\nAt 14 she deserves her own room.

Of course he wants to actually have custody of his child.

Of course she\u2019d rather have her own room.", "YTA. She is not spoiled for wanting her father to buy a home big enough for her. Buying a home is completely different from renting. You buy the home anticipating family growth. It's much harder to get out of a mortgage than a lease when your family outgrows the home. \n\nI think you need to do some serious work here. It seems that you thought he was going to be a mostly absent father to his daughter and just be able to start a whole new family with you. He has a family, if you want to join it that's awesome. But you don't get to make room for yourself and a hypothetical baby when there's a living breathing child who this man brought into the world. \n\nIt's kind of concerning that you seem to like the \"deadbeat\" aspects of him while disliking the parts where he's being an actual dad.", "YTA\n\nShe is not spoiled!

OF COURSE SHE DOES!! It\u2019s his child. \nFrom the main post and your comments, I can feel the disdain you have for this child already. This young lady is, very reasonably, thinking of the future. I know it\u2019s hypothetical at this point, but you\u2019ve clearly discussed having a baby. Even if you waited 4+ years, you\u2019re still saying she has to move out and has no where to stay if she comes back.", "YTA. You are essentially having a tantrum about not getting everything you want. You're demanding a child make consessions when you refuse to (re waiting to move in with your partner). This is a complete human being we are talking about and the daughter of your partner. Making a life with another person does require compromise and a teenager isn't some ornament you can shove in a closet. If you actually care about the life you both have ahead of you, you should apologise to your partner and start an adult discussion about how youre both going to tackle this challenge together.", "She is his daughter, you right now are just the fiance. You don't come first here.\n\nIt's not spoiled for a 14 year old girl to want her own room.\n\nSounds like that particular house is a bad choice. Maybe look for a fixer upper that has more space and renovate over time and put your stamp in the house.  \n\nRight now YTA here. What the daughter is asking for isn't some temper tantrum, it's very reasonable. If you end up having children, how long before you try to put that child in the same room as the 14 year old? Odds are from day 1.", "YTA - Big time. You don't need to insult his parenting - mainly because he hasn't been the one to do it. She's felt abandoned by him before and it sounds like he's trying to make up for a lot of that. Props to him. She is at an age where she needs her own room, and if I was her, I would stay where I'm at, too. There is only one brat in this scenario, and it's 100% OP.", "YTA at 14 she need privacy and not to be sharing a room with a toddler who will touch and break her things this isn't spoilt behaviour i at that age wouldn't want to share a room with a small child either specially since she would be at least 16 by the time your kid is a toddler with no privacy and toddlers get into everything", "They deserve better than you. This turns into \u201cAITA for throwing my dad, his wife and my half sister out of Thanksgiving\u201d in 8 years because you\u2019re ALREADY putting an unborn child and your feelings in Front of her needs.  \n\nYTA, I hope you or he figures it out and quick", "YTA. And a huge one. Expecting a teenager to share a room with a future baby/toddler. No privacy, no place of her own. Its painfully obvious you don't like his daughter. Which should be a red flag for him. Don't even come back saying you do... If you did there would never be a question of her having her own room. Just break up already, find someone with no kids, and get your tubes tied. You are clueless when it comes to the needs of children, & certainly don't need any.", "YTA\n\nThey are a package deal lady if you can't accept that break up with him so he can find a woman who understands that", "She is spoiled because she doesn't want to share a room with a baby?  I think she shows common sense.", "This has to be deliberate, you choose to simply have an incredibly inadequate living situation because you know it means his daughter won\u2019t wanna live with him and then you don\u2019t have to deal with being a step parent. \n\nYTA. Teenagers cannot share bedrooms with babies. They cannot be sleep deprived, they cannot have privacy and all of their possessions would be accessed by a baby which is unreasonable.", "YTA. You seem very immature and I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re getting married to someone with a child when it is clear you don\u2019t like said child. I\u2019m 26 too and my SO is also 29. We are expecting our first and guess what? We bought a three bedroom house bc it gives room to grow. I would NEVER expect a teen to share a room with a toddler/ baby. Ever. Grow up or maybe find a relationship that\u2019s more right for you.", "I do think Nia and Dan have valid concerns.

Are you planning the house purchase with her in mind eg will it be in the same school district, is it close by to her grandparents?", "YTA. Yeah you shouldn\u2019t have children if you cant afford them. Dan already has one and doesn\u2019t seem to be able to afford her, considering her legal guardians are her grandparents. Id stay with them too.", "YTA for calling her spoiled.  That's crossing a line for a step parent.\n\nBUT, he's going to prioritize his daughter, in making a relationship with her.  If you can't handle that, or are seeing her as an obstacle already, do NOT marry this man.  You'll save all 3 of you from ending bitterly.", "YTA. Its not unreasonable for a 14yo to say she wants space and to not have to share with babies and toddlers - neither of which are known for their ability to be quiet or give a teenager space.\n\nSorry to break it to you, but you're trying to make Dan chose between you and her - and you're losing your own game.", "YTA \n\nA lot of your comments indicate you think she\u2019s the one who ruined this plan you had; the house, the husband, the baby. But she didn\u2019t \u201cveto\u201d the house (in your words) she just said she wouldn\u2019t want to live there with you guys as she didn\u2019t want to be pushed out by a baby. \n\nIt was your partner who decided that if she didn\u2019t want to come neither did he. She never asked you not to buy the house, never made a fuss about u guys moving in without her, never asked you for a larger house or expected you to push a budget you didn\u2019t have. She made a very grown up decision based on the information given to her and YOUR PARTNER decided to prioritise her over you, and you blame her?? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think your partner was right to prioritise her over you (you are always a parent over anything else) but it\u2019s odd to me your blaming a kid for her parents choice?", "A teen needs privacy, and this has nothing to do with being spoilt. I am surprised that you did not know this. This should have been obvious when you planned a life with Dan- please note- this is a package deal.

Doubt reddit can help you. \n\nYTA.", "YTA he wants his daughter in his life he needed to put up because he was so young,and when looking for a house you thought it was a good idea to get a 2 bedroom one?do you expect a sixteen year old at that point to share a room with a Baby?\n\nthat would be the situation Dan had if he would have if his parents didn't step in at that time...\n\nIf you can't afford a bigger house you won't be able to afford a baby,seems like you aren't as compatible as you thought", "YTA.  She made a decision based on what she knew. And she had options.  That\u2019s not being spoiled.

You clearly do not understand teenagers and think that they should be dictated to. This girl has had to deal with a lot of changes recently, as well as changes coming up.  She chose to assert herself for the one thing she needs - privacy and space as the world changes around her. And having that option and recognising it does not make her spoilt.  Just because you think children should just follow whatever their parents tell them doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s how children and parenting work, and specifically how Dan and his daughter do things. She is so important to him, and you seem to just treat her as an annoyance. You should really consider long and hard whether you are ready for this situation. \n\nAnd I really hope that your fianc\u00e9 finds this post, and especially your comments.

You are incapable of seeing another person's perspective.  \nShe has her own room in her GP's house, and moving in with the potential of sharing with an infant is a downgrade to her lifestyle and she'd be leaving the \"parents\" that raised her to move on with someone that lacks any self awareness, compassion or empathy. \nEither learn to compromise and find acceptable living conditions for you while family or be prepared to be an ex-fiance.", "YTA, after reading your comments I think you should stop planning to have kids in the future. Good luck alienating you partners daughter, and I can only see this ending in him leaving you.", "INFO: so we all know that babies wake up several times a night, right?

There\u2019s a lot of the comments here talking about how it\u2019s not unreasonable for a teenager to want her own room, and each time the response discussion has ended up here: it\u2019s not about the room for you. You\u2019re upset because Nia you feel that Nia doesn\u2019t respect your authority and that she\u2019s \u201cchoosing a room over family\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. Nia has been raised by her grandparents. Dan isn\u2019t her legal guardian. He clearly loves his daughter and now that he\u2019s an established adult with means of his own, he wants to be her father in a way he wasn\u2019t able to before. \n\nYou\u2019re upset because you want to live with your fianc\u00e9e. You \u201cdon\u2019t mind\u201d if Nia lives with you. I\u2019m willing to bet you don\u2019t mind if she doesn\u2019t either. I think she feels much the same way. She\u2019s wouldn\u2019t mind living with you, but she\u2019s perfectly happy staying where she is, and sees no reason to really change it - especially if it becomes objectively \u201cworse\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about her being \u201cspoilt\u201d and caring more about a room than her family. Living with her grandparents, her dad, and his siblings *is* her family. The preference is that the core family be kept together right? Well in this case, the sides are opposite: Nia\u2019s grandparents *are* her core family. Their home *is* her core home. There\u2019s a good chance that you could inherit a mansion, and she still wouldn\u2019t want to leave her grandparents \n\nSo living together as a family is mainly important to Dan. You\u2019re choosing to blame Nia, but honestly it\u2019s Dan\u2019s decision that has put you in this position. Has he asked her if she *wants* to live with you both? Or is he hoping that if he finds the perfect house, the perfect room she\u2019ll jump at the chance? He needs your support, and this needs to be something you\u2019re both willing to discuss as a team.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re hurt that Nia didn\u2019t jump at the chance to form a family with you, but honestly why would she? You\u2019re her dad\u2019s girlfriend, and from your description her dad isn\u2019t her primary parental figure. There\u2019s a good chance that internally she sees him as a much older brother. Why would a young teenager care about what their big brother\u2019s gf thinks about living together?", "Oh my god wait. You\u2019re not even pregnant yet? So this is all a hypothetical and you\u2019re calling the 14 year old unreasonable?!? \n\nYou should end this relationship before a baby is conceived. You clearly don\u2019t even like Nia, saying \u201cshe\u2019s fine\u201d and every comment you have such contempt for her. Why on earth would you choose to do this to yourself and to your fianc\u00e9 and his family? You should love that girl as if she was your own. Ugh I feel sick for Nia. Bio mom isn\u2019t around and now the chick dad wants to marry is insane. Yikes! \n\nIt sounds like they made the most out of a tough situation when Nia was born. She is very loved.

We said yes. She asked us if we are planning to have kids together. We told her that she knows that we do. She said No thank you I'll stay with my grandparents.\n\nDan freaked out and asked her why. She said she doesn't want to share a bedroom with someone.\n\nNow my finace says he won't move in with me unless we find a bigger home with more bedrooms because \"he won't go anywhere without his daughter\"\n\nWe can't afford a bigger room so this way we won't be able to move in together for who knows how long?

She gets to be spoiled and honestly you would think seeing how loved she is, you'd be glad to bring a baby into such a family. So what if she doesn't want to share a room? SHE HASNT HAD TO IN 14 YEARS!! Asking a teenager to give up her privacy and safe space to share with a literal newborn is so selfish. Youre asking her to stay up most nights to listen to that baby cry and would probably expect her to help! \"The baby probably won't be here till she is 18.\" Even worse, let's room a literal young adult with an infant and try to wreck her ability to succeed in college or if she has a job. Sounds to me you're the spoiled one because it's apparently your way or the highway. You ever considered that maybe you could look at houses with nice attics or basements to convert to a bedroom?

How are you planning to treat your own children??\n\nClearly yta, idk if you grew up struggling or in a controlling household or what but everything you're calling spoiled is completely normal.

Your comments have a strong underlying tone of distaste towards Nia, which I imagine might come across even more clearly to her and everyone else in person. \n\nSome gentle advice: When you choose to marry someone who has a kid, you are choosing both of those people. They are a unit. And you are -joining- this unit that already exists (despite it being unconventional). You are not creating a new unit with your fianc\u00e9, you are joining his with his daughter. I bet if you genuinely approach your relationship with Nia with that mindset (instead of viewing her as the \u2018outsider\u2019 coming in), your relationship with her (and consequently, her dad) will improve. \n\nI know it sucks to feel like everyone is dogpiling on you, especially when it\u2019s a surprise. But you\u2019ve got a fantastic opportunity here for some self-reflection, mindset re-framing, and personal growth.

And not all 3 bedroom homes cost more than 2 bedroom.", "With her future stepmom's reaction, do you really think she's keeping the baby in their room? And even if she moved out at 18, when visiting, she'll stay where?

So, they should wait until they're more financially stable.", "you, you're the baby", "You and your fiance said you plan to have kids and shove them in the same room. There isnt a baby now but you will selfishly put a baby in that room eventually according to your own words.", "Why did you post here? This is a subreddit to determine if YTA -\nyou are btw. You don\u2019t seem to care about anything but defending yourself, so really why post here?\n\nWhatever this resentment you have over a 14 year old proves that not only are YTA, but not mature enough for a family of your own. Grow up before having that kid, if not yourself for the baby.", "Yeah I read OPs back and forth with someone here and it was pure gold. \n\nI thought the point of this sub was to get third party opinion on a problem.

It's ops attitude towards the 14 year old.", "I can understand why she feels like that. But where it gets Disney villlian-y is because she's failing to understand the other side of the equation from Nia's point of view.", "Exactly! Granted I can't imagine a teenager being able to understand that kind of logic because what 14 / 15 year old does, but it still seems like they're trying to be difficult over a possible eventuality that might or might not be an inconvenience to her, and as a result just making this more difficult for this couple", "YTA.\n\n\u201cDan insists that Nia come with us\u201d and \u201cI have no problem with [my fianc\u00e9\u2019s underaged child] living with us\u201d?

He probably has been waiting a long time to have everyone together in one house, or has been waiting for him to have his life together before bringing his daughter to live with him - it could be his picture perfect idea is shattered and his initial reaction wasn't the most polite. But IMHO the step-daughter seemed perfectly reasonable especially since her input was requested. Maybe there is another solution - convert a house with a finished basement into a livable space or something else.", "We really don\u2019t know what was going on at the time.

Americans are then expected to share a room with a stranger in college and with their partners, don't know why people make such a huge deal about sharing a room with your sibling.\n\nThat being said, I agree is not the same sharing a room with a baby than a closed aged sibling, a baby will not let a teenager sleep the hours she needs.", "During the housing market crash, my family of six was stuck in a one bedroom apartment.

I live in a culture now where many people live at home into their 30s until they get married. It helps them save money and prepare better for their futures. There is no grind culture before 25 and everyone is far more at peace because they don\u2019t worry about their parents kicking them out for no reason. \n\nIf she wants to live with her father past 18 and he wants her there\u2014that has nothing to do with you.

You're repeating this over and over as if when she turns 18 she will stop existing or something, the truth is you just want her to shut up and be ok with whatever you want to do or else, and she's the spoiled one? Get a grip, make better plans she's the daugther of your boyfriend she comes first to him and if you are going to be his wife and take the role of stepmother, she should be a priority to you too,if you don't see it that way, then maybe this isn't the man for you, step out of their life and stop blaming a 14yo for your poor desicions.", "Then why didn\u2019t you offer to not get pregnant until she\u2019s 18?
