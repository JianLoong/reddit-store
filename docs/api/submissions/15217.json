No, she doesn't get to announce ahead of time that she's going to be pissy and you have to \"get over it.\"  Y'all need couples counseling.", "NTA - was she like this before you had kids? My wife personality shifted towards this after our first. She was eventually diagnosed with Post Natal Depression and is still struggling with it but a lot better now.", "As one poster noted, is she dealing with some postpartum issues? Or is she just difficult? Either way she needs to see someone pronto. Can you offer her constructive help in the meantime? Sounds like she is telling you she is overwhelmed. She should not act out, but listen to what she is saying versus labeling the reaction. I know you feel attacked and I am sorry, but don't get stuck on that.", "NTA. But your wife is being abusive.", "NTA\n\nIt's hard to control your mood, but you can still choose the words you to say to someone. It takes practice and sometimes you have to speak slower because you have to choose your words and phrases carefully. It does sound like there are other issues at play here. I'd think a couple's counselor - at least a few visits might be worthwhile, or maybe it would help her to talk to a counselor alone to help her discover the root cause of these moods.", "NTA- It's not fair for her to take her anger out on you all of the time. There was probably a nicer way of speaking to her about it, but I get it. Sometimes it's hard not being heard.", "NTA. It\u2019s a common rule for both children and adults that *It\u2019s okay to be upset but not okay to be mean*.

If not I\u2019d recommend it asap.", "Family/couples therapy might help.", "NTA - something seems to be really bothering her and you two need to develop the language to safely convey emotions without blame.

My mother was exactly like your wife and it greatly affected me as a child and still as an adult. What 30 yr old should be overcome with anxiety because they heard their mother sighs just like she used to when she was unhappy and about to snap at their dad?\n\nIt could be that she is also resenting being a stay at home mom, but again you two need to work out communication skills so she can express without projecting and blaming and you can listen without taking punches.", "NTA but not every couple has this kind of problem and it is most certainly worth mentioning.  It sounds like your wife has an anger management problem aggravated or caused by underlying issues.  My wife suffers from severe OCD/germaphobia which frustrates her to the point of explosive anger first towards herself and then me.  I love my wife and after more than a quarter century together, she still makes me go soft in the middle, but had she not addressed her issues with medication and therapy, I would have ended it a long time ago.", "ESH.  It genuinely sounds like she is under a great deal of stress and may be depressed.

I've seen lots of others ask questions about history, which is def relevant, I just want to add that I agree she needs help / therapy. \n\nMy husband would sometimes do this to me (be mean to me because he feels bad about himself, low esteem, not for anything I've done). I've used words much more harsh than \"childish\" and sorry, but truth hurts. He might get mad at first, but invariably he will think on it, realize he was being an ass and then come back and apologize and stop being an ass.", "NTA. She needs to grow up and get some adult coping mechanisms. Tantrums are not ok.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t be taking her anger out on you", "Noone should take their bad day out on you and Noone should plan ahead to have a bad day. I'm sorry but she is just mean and uses you as a punching bag and as per her, your suppose to be ok with it. So next time do what a adult does to a child having a tantrum. Ignore it. Ignore the stomps, cold shoulder and look. When you don't react to her, she should stop. Tell her you won't react until she can respect you as a human not punching bag", "Doesn't sound like she likes being a stay at home mom. I don't think you were an asshole but you should definitely bring that up to her when you get a chance.", "NAH. It sounds like your wife didn't have the best examples of healthy communication growing up and may need some therapy to help work through it. It wasn't until couples therapy that I found out my partners mother used to literally ice him and his siblings out for weeks at a time. Like, she would just stop talking to them. It made what I had perceived as immature communication from him make a lot more sense.\n\nI'm not in anyway saying that she's right for how she's treating you, because she's not and your hurt is valid. But a lot of us didn't see healthy communication. I'm at least happy that she is saying hey please be patient with me if I seem in a bad mood later\u2014 believe it or not that means she's acknowledging in her own way that she knows it's not you. She sounds overwhelmed.\n\nThe negative cycle was a new term for me and helped us a lot. So did the feelings wheel and a few other things that the therapist gave us as tools to help us build a better style of talking to another.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s giving you a heads up that she\u2019s struggling and you\u2019re not hearing her", "ESH\n\nI agree your wife could better communicate and be nicer, but that also goes for you.  Calling her a child and immature is actively dismissiing of how she is feeling, even if she needs to work on how she communicates it.\n\nThere's a bigger problem at play here - outside of the lack of thorough communication - is likely linked to the amount of help your wife may or may not receive.  She sounds overloaded and stressed - how much do the two of you really talk - I mean *really talk* \\- now since you've had kids?", "Maybe the word childish was not the best choice, but your wife can't continue to make your life like hell. But something is going on. Maybe she's unhappy.

Maybe you're just not made for each other.\n\nNAH", ">We have problems like anyone else - nothing worth mentioning\n\nI dunno, it seems like there could be something more going on than you're letting on.   \n\n\nESH so far because it seems that the both of you talk AT each other and not TO each other about what's really bugging each of you.", "YTA sounds like your family's current situation is not working for everyone and calling your wife names won't make it any better. You guys need councelling or family therapy, or you'll be divorced sooner than you think.", "ESH. While it's understandable that you want your wife to treat you kindly and communicate better when she's upset, calling her \"childish\" is not a productive way to address the issue. It's likely to make her feel defensive and may escalate the conflict. Instead, try to approach the conversation with empathy, and focus on how her actions make you feel rather than labeling her behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, your wife needs to work on managing her emotions and finding healthier ways to express her frustrations. It's not fair for her to take out her bad moods on you, especially when you're not the cause of her stress. It's important for both of you to work together on improving your communication and finding better ways to handle conflict in your relationship.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly have no respect for your wife. Asking you to be patient with her if she\u2019s in a bad mood is not immature. She was sharing how she was feeling and why. You took that as a personal attack rather than her telling you about her mental state. I would say that\u2019s more childish on your part. You being so uninterested and unsupportive is probably making her emotional state worse.

I hope you\u2019re able to improve your communication skills. From what I\u2019m reading here though you could start by just trying to differentiate between when someone is expressing anger and when someone is trying to direct that anger at you. It can be hard when people sound aggressive when angry (compared to others who maybe come off as sad). Also plenty of people don\u2019t want to be kissed when they\u2019re actually upset with someone/ in a bad mood. These are communication styles and can be combined with issues of sensory defensiveness. Wait until things are calm, express sympathy, and ask how you two can get on the same page. She honestly might not know. That would be annoying for you but good for her to confront. She needs to know what she wants from you so that the two of you can come to a mutual understanding about communication styles.

Baby is one now.", "Right - nah it was normal. That\u2019s her way of telling me she needs space - she can\u2019t just say \u201cbabe I need space\u201d.

If the baby is a year old - would your wife prefer to put the baby in daycare and go back to work? Even a part-time job. She might feel like she's \"stuck\" at home and needs to find her freedom again. \n\nThere is a lot more that needs to be uncovered. Your wife's attitude sends off some pretty shaky vibes and absolutely y'all need to figure this out. Please don't ignore this and push through another year. Y'all need to find out what the problem is and fix it.", "NAH-\nThis happened to me. But I was the wife.

I understand that you\u2019re frustrated but calling your wife childish when she\u2019s already upset isn\u2019t ever going to work out well for you. Also, it might go over much better if you talk about the issue when she\u2019s calm.

I understand that it can be challenging to communicate effectively, especially in emotionally charged situations. It's great to hear that you've been making efforts to approach the situation empathetically in the past. While it's natural to feel frustrated, it's important to remember that using labels like \"childish\" can often escalate the conflict rather than resolving it. Instead, consider focusing on specific behaviors or actions that you find problematic and discuss them calmly and respectfully.

This sub is so biased towards women it is actually ridiculous.", "OP, you say that she was not like this before, so this nastiness is a deviation from her usual character. A long term deviation from character is a sign that something is wrong. It could be with her, like a mental health issue, or something in your marriage.

He is in therapy now and I give him space or make sure he has time to himself", "I'm not excusing her behavior. It's not okay for her to behave like that and she is responsible for her actions.\n\nI had anxiety that would manifest as anger. I didn't even realize it was anxiety that caused the rage I felt. After several years and many, many medications to attempt to manage the anxiety, a new doctor suggested testing me for ADHD after my son was diagnosed. Now that my ADHD is being treated, my anxiety is exponentially better. I don't get the feelings of rage that I used to experience. I feel better and I'm able to be better. In the same vein, PPD and PPA can show up beyond the first year. Being a stay at home parent can be draining in every aspect of life.

She stomps around the house, gives me the cold shoulder, ignores me, gives me \u201cthe look\u201d, etc etc. \n\nYeah, that's all really awful behaviour. It's one thing to be in a foul mood and to not want to deal with others during it, but if they vent their frustrations on uninvolved parties, and especially if they do this often it becomes outright toxic mismanagement of emotions and anger. It's a sign of a person who either never learned to handle their anger in a healthy fashion or, in the case of the Veruca Salts of the world, were shielded from needing to.\n\n>\u201cif you come home today and I\u2019m in a bad mood, be patient with me\u201d, then listing all of the things she was dreading for the day (being with the kids, picking up our daughter from school, doing homework with her, she\u2019s a stay at home mom). I called her out bc I know what she was really saying was \u201cif I\u2019m a bitch to you today when you get home get over it\u201d. \n\nI feel like this accurately describes the intent on her part, and falls prey of that mentality, \"if you can't take me at my worst,\" that some people have in this world.\n\nFact is, again, this is an unhealthy dynamic.

Ok if she really is ok with that\u2026and she\u2019s allowed to decide later she wants control of her own finances of course.

My point was that if both parents work, then 50/50 is fair but when one works and the other is at home (non medical reasons, non volunteering, not for profit work, etc.) Than  they have the time to do more work.

Good luck", "NTA, it's OK to be patient with people but you don't have to tolerate being someone's emotional punching bag", "I\u2019d like to add to what Independent-Oil said because this is a technique teachers often use when a student is disrespectful.  You ignore the behavior and when she inevitably complains about it, you calmly and matter-of-factly say something along the lines of, \u201cI do not deserve to be treated with disrespect. If you want my attention, you will need to change your tone and talk to me with a respectful tone of voice.\u201d  Another line I\u2019ve used is, \u201cI will be happy to talk with you after you adjust your attitude and tone of voice.\u201d\n\nThe key to this is to not lose your cool and to stay calm.\n\nI went through an angry period for awhile, and my husband pulled me back in line by not accepting any rude attitude or tone I flicked at him.

They said what they think and you're entitled to disagree but they aren't dictating to anyone", "Again the only people who can call it fair or unfair are the two people in the relationship. I understand you don't want to hear that, but everyone is different and the only percentage that you can apply a fair or unfairness to is what YOU and YOUR partner agree on. No more no less."]}
