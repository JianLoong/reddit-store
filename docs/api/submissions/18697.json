Sometimes I laugh when I\u2019m a bit out of touch with the conversation. On one hand you said you never really talk about your journey with Amy, so how is she always snickering on a subject you never really talk with her about? Either you talk to her about it and she always snickers or you don\u2019t talk to her about it, but it can\u2019t be both ways. You\u2019re really insecure and it\u2019s sad, you can be fit and insecure just like someone can be fat and insecure. Maybe work on yourself before having friends, I feel you haven\u2019t gotten fully over your eating disorder, at least not the mental part. Fat-phobic is a thing, since you can have a phobia of nearly anything, my mom is/was fat phobic nearly her whole life. She fears they could fall on her, that they\u2019re like a disease that smells and lacks self control and awareness. You\u2019re fat phobic and obesophobia, but realize that and stop allowing heavier people in your circle/around you. You\u2019ve wanted to talk bad about her/to her and was just waiting for a moment and decided to use this moment that didn\u2019t necessarily exist in your perceived way to do such. Never be around people you just want to belittle, because you\u2019d never want them to do the same to you. As I tell my daughter \u201csomeone\u2019s actions doesn\u2019t determine your character\u201d, she didn\u2019t make you act that way, that\u2019s just who you are and you can\u2019t help it, but you\u2019re still wrong.", "Gentle YTA from another person in recovery from disordered eating.\n\nThe way in which you lashed out at your friend speaks to the healing that you still need to do. Someone with a healthy relationship to exercise, food, and weight does not automatically assume that others are bitter because they are heavier. This is the worldview of someone who is still held hostage by the belief that happiness is only possible for thin and fit people. \n\nI\u2019m happy to hear that you feel healthier, but I would still encourage you to have regular check-ins with a doc, nutritionist, and/or therapist. When your entire life revolves around nutrition and exercise, disordered eating habits and related thoughts can sneak back in where you\u2019re not expecting them. \n\nI have been exactly where you are and I know how personal it feels when we perceive that someone is making judgments about us, but I also know that sometimes, what feels like judgment is actually worry/concern or even exhaustion. It took years for me to change my own internal narratives and beliefs around fat, and I realize now that I was incredibly unkind (fatphobic) to others under the guise of being healthy. That can be death by a million paper cuts to even the closest friendships. \n\nBut hey, be easy on yourself. I like to think of my ED as a sneaky lil monster that creeps up on me sometimes and makes me think or say things I don\u2019t actually mean. I think with some reflection, you\u2019ll realize that this was the ED talking, and you now have a golden opportunity to engage in some relationship repair to make your friendship stronger. \n\nSending hope and love!", "ESH. Do either of you actually like each other? You don't sound like friends.\n\nIf you somehow are actually invested in staying friends then apologize and explain why you snapped. Be an adult and have a conversation.", "ESH you did make a dig at her but she also provoked you. \n\nYou could have looked at her directly and asked what was funny, that would have gotten your point across", "YTA. I\u2019m not sure why you think you are her friend considering how you judge her", "NTA. I have to imagine the people saying otherwise are people just like Amy.", "I'm going to go with an ESH. You have a right to your feelings but you maybe should have had a talk with her prior about how you don't like her comments instead of bottling them up and going nuclear in one instance.

YOU ARE ALWAYS AN ASSHOLE FOR COMMENTING ON SOMEONES WEIGHT. NO MATTER WHAT.", "YTA.", "ESH. Both of you were acting pretty poorly. No, she shouldn't smirk or chuckle when you talk about your marathon training. That's rude.\n\nBut you shouldn't have made any comment about her weight. I wonder, is she actually jealous of you? Or is this just your own perception? You didn't say she actually made fun of you. You said it \"feels as though she makes fun of me\". So, out of curiosity, how much of this is what she is actually saying and doing, versus your own perception. And first you say that you never talk about your training with Amy, then you say that she \"always pipes up when I talk about exercise\". So, do you never talk about it, or is it a regular occurrence that you talk about it? Could it be that you are actually bringing it up a lot more than you think? That doesn't make it right for her to smirk about it, of course, but it's something to think about.\n\nIf this person is actually your friend, hopefully you'll sit down and have a direct conversation with her. I think it would be good.", "NTA, idk how Reddit fails to notice that you are belittled constantly for *your* health and body.", "NTA. She was sitting there laughing at you. Fuck her.", "ESH - She seemed a little jealous and your reaction was petty.  Maybe have a hear to heart conversation.", "ESH\u2026but you\u2019re not really helping. \n\nIt sounds like Amy has reached a point where she wants to make some changes to her lifestyle. But here\u2019s the thing - and this happens with everyone super fit person I know - you\u2019re not seeing that there\u2019s space between where she is and athlete. \n\nDude, let me tell you, there is. She\u2019s not going to turn into you overnight, but if you genuinely care about her and want to help her, you need to meet her where she IS, not where you think she should be. \n\nI took up running during Covid, and I could NOT run at all. My lifestyle, tbh, sounds like it was similar to Amy\u2019s.

You work up to that. \n\nIt\u2019s great that she\u2019s showing some interest, but all you\u2019re doing with going on about your perfectly honed fitness routine is making her feel like she doesn\u2019t stand a chance\u2026and then she gets pissy and takes it out in you. It\u2019s really hard to want to change and not know where to start.

I'd also suggest that if you're this triggered by your fat \"friend\" smirking at you while talking about working out maybe you're not as recovered from that ED as you think.", "The solution to your issues is not the solution to another person's issues.\n\nBTW, your username, even if it's a throwaway feels like a symptom too.", "i was thinking the same thing and wondering if she\u2019s projecting onto her friend bc she is fat \ud83e\udd37", "How would you feel if you were to eat a lot and not be able to work out for one reason or another (gym was closed for repairs, you aren\u2019t feeling well, etc.)\n\nI ask because it really seems like you haven\u2019t solved your complex about eating, either. Justifying your calories as fuel for a workout is still disordered eating, and lashing out at others like this is a dead giveaway that you\u2019re white-knuckling this. \n\nIt took me a full decade to truly feel like my eating disorder was in remission, and it still pops up at times when other aspects of life get difficult. It\u2019s a daily struggle, nobody ever slays their dragon fully so we have to learn to be proud of ourselves for just getting up every morning and getting a couple good swings of the sword in. This also includes humbling yourself and understanding that everybody\u2019s struggling, and that some people\u2019s\u2019 struggles are simply more visible to you, but that\u2019s not a metric to judge how they\u2019re handling them.", "If you can not exercise for a day/week would you lower/stop eating?", "Sounds to me like you\u2019re over sensitive.", "OP, truly not a sarcastic question: Did you get any counseling while overcoming your ED? I ask because having had one myself and had friends struggle with one, I found it\u2019s so very easy to take the anxiety and obsession involved with eating with EDs and unhealthfully transfer it to another health outlet\u2026and I kind of wonder from your description if you have done that with exercise? There is even an ED called *exercise bulimia* that discusses this tendency to overuse exercise this way. \n\nI may be completely wrong, but your brief description is raising a red flag for me, though I\u2019m admittedly hyper sensitive because of my own journey. Just thoughtfully consider whether exercise has taken an unhealthy portion of your attention and time and conversation.", "No, it doesn't. Congratulations, you've done something to conquer your demons. Guess what? By lowering yourself to her level, you've become an AH.

Also, you\u2019re the AH. I\u2019m sure she knows something that we including your other friends don\u2019t know, like maybe working out with you isn\u2019t as much fun as you imply and maybe you talk about it too much and she\u2019s annoyed at this point.

Again you dk why she's \"snickering\" or anything, you have just decided why. You haven't asked her. You haven't talked to her about it.

The reason I decided to use working out as an outlet wasn't intentional but at the time, I was so afraid to eat and put on weight that I was starving myself. Ended up in the hospital a few times because I kept fainting. Had to move back in with my parents and they helped me eat and we went on walks so I was doing some kind of exercise to sort of battle the whole eating calories thing and it just continued from there to the point I run now and ended up enjoying it. I guess I always considered myself overcoming it because I don't faint anymore but from seeing these comments, I think mentally I have not", "Yeah, I was reading this and its pretty clear OP still has an untreated ED, she has just moved the obsession and control onto workout related ish.

She and Jane are probably about equal and Cara is bigger but they're both respectful and listen to me talk about it without saying anything. \n\nI don't think she's comfortable in her weight to be honest. She's expressed desire before that she wants to be thinner and I know working out is a way to get there", "Yes, marathon entries have been gifts to me and another one of my friends does ultra and passed me her old gear so we can run together. One of my cousins does my nutrition. I don't really spend much apart from on fuel to drive. I also run after work so it doesn't eat into my hours. It's tight but it works. \n\nNo I haven't asked. I would be open to talking about it with her but she makes digs and I don't really want to do that unless she comes to me first", "Yeah I think this has come to an end. I haven't asked her because it's a pattern where it only comes up during my fitness stuff. The snickering at lunch was only when I was talking about my training.
