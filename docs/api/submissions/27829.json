We met when we were pretty young (18 and 20) and had our fair share of relationship issues in the first few years. Things have gotten much better and I think we're generally happy. \n\nA few days ago was my 30th birthday and although we didn't have any big plans (just dinner with my family in the evening), I assumed we would spend the day together. The beginning of the day started with us getting coffee and sitting on the couch together. He played Cyberpunk all morning and I had a conference call for work for an hour in the afternoon but I had the rest of the day off. A few minutes before my call started, he told me he was leaving to \"run a few errands\". He texted me right after he left and asked if I wanted pizza for lunch. I said sure! \nThe call ended an hour later and I waited another hour with no word from him. \n\nFinally, after two hours of waiting, I texted him and told him I no longer wanted the pizza. I was starving but this point, I was soon ready to leave for my parents house and wouldn't be hungry at dinner if I ate pizza. He responded \"I'm on my way home. I'll explain when I get there.\" He turned up about 15 minutes later with a pizza box in hand and as it turns out, he went out for two beers with a friend and \"lost track of time\". Reddit, I was MAD. I walked to my car, told him he was no longer invited to dinner, got in the car and locked the door. He tried to open it and I just said \"No, you're not going.\" He kicked my car door and walked inside. He called me after I left and I really laid into him for leaving me hanging on my birthday. Also, for not even getting me so much as a card. I told him it was ridiculous for him to leave me hanging for lunch he had promised, not telling me where he was going and that he was inconsiderate. I was heated because of his 'it was no big deal' reaction and kicking my car door! I did yell and I wasn't nice. \n\nI went to dinner with my parents and came home around 10 to flowers and a card on the table. I immediately went to bed. \n\nWhen we talked about it, he was really upset over the way I spoke to him on the phone. He said he would not be my \"whipping boy\" and that my reaction was unacceptable. He continued to say he lost track of time and left his phone in the car. He said he didn't try to be inconsiderate and didn't think it was an issue because we didn't have any concrete plans... I just expected that he would want to spend time together and would at least get me something? But beers with a friend? That seems really rude. \n\nAITA for expecting some communication, consideration or something more? I know birthdays were never a big deal to his family, but he's never snubbed me like this!", "created_utc": 1695926103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16unpuu/aita_for_being_upset_over_being_snubbed_on_my/", "score": 493, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\n\n30 is a big birthday. If my boyfriend disappeared for hours I would be expecting the best surprise! Beer with friends??? Oh hell no girl, that is unacceptable. When you said he was playing video games I thought it was ' I'm going to pretend I don't care' for him to have a massive something planned. What an a hole. You did the right thing", "NTA. How long have you been engaged? You sure you want to marry someone like that?", "NTA- birthday or not, my husband telling me he\u2019s bringing home pizza and 2hrs go by and I don\u2019t have pizza I\u2019m gonna be livid! Then he kicked your door?! How old is he? Cause that sounds like something my 5yr old would do! And wtf is a \u201cwhipping boy\u201d? Your reaction was perfectly acceptable. What\u2019s not acceptable is him not bringing home the food he promised! On your birthday!!", "NTA. Girl. You\u2019re 30. Don\u2019t waste another decade.", "NTA. Question, do you love each other or are you in a relationship just because you\u2019ve gotten comfortable with each other? The whole going to have beers with a friend and losing track of time especially on your birthday is mind boggling to me.", "He wasnt at the bar for two hours without his phone is my take, the anger is to shut down any further discussion and turn the blame. Hes got a side thing I would give it a 70% chance with current info. Think about it like this he went out for pizza so what he realized he wasnt hungry but was thirsty instead. He also said explain when I get home meaning he didnt want to be on the phone right then, wonder why\u2026", "NTA. It\u2019s your 30th birthday, that\u2019s a big deal! Quite frankly, I think spending time on a birthday with anyone you deeply care is a big deal, regardless whether it\u2019s a milestone or not.\n\nIf something came up, the least he could have done was send you a text or give you a quick call to let you know. Especially if he knew you were at home waiting for pizza for two hours.", "NTA\n\n>**He tried to open it** and I just said \"No, you're not going.\" **He kicked my car door** and walked inside.\n\nThere's being upset and then there's being *upset*.   \n\n\n>He said he would not be my \"whipping boy\" and that my reaction was unacceptable.\n\nDeflecting.  \n\n\n>He continued to say he lost track of time and left his phone in the car.\n\nDisregard for your feelings. Disrespectful. He called to ask if you wanted pizza, you said yes, and he chose to hang out with friends anyway.  \n\n\n>we didn't have any concrete plans\n\nClearly forgot about dinner with your family.\n\nI'm not saying these are red flags, per say, but they're immature responses to a situation. He's very clearly in the wrong and he knows he's very clearly in the wrong. However, immature adults who aren't used to being wrong and called out for it, or apologizing, respond in this manner. They'll try to twist and turn it to be anything other than 100% your fault. I'm surprised you didn't write about any other forms of gaslighting like how it may be your fault because you didn't plan anything. \n\nLastly, and not sure why this isn't called out anywhere else, but he was there for a **couple of hours** and had a **couple of beers**. \n\nThen he **drove** home.\n\nThis is concerning.", "NTA\n\nboyfriend\u2019s behavior was unnacceptable whether you had concrete plans or not.", "NTA and you deserve better. Regardless of having concrete plans, regardless of it *even being your birthday*, his lack of communication and attention can't be taken lightly. He said he would do something, albeit basic, and he didn't follow through with it.\n\nAnd while birthdays may not be a big thing within his family, it's still known that they're for celebrating that person. He should be celebrating you, birthday or not, so this is unacceptable.", "NTA.", "NTA at the very least he should have communicated with you with specifics like what would you like to do today? And the \u201c running errands\u201d is vague af. I would have thought the errands had to do with you. I\u2019m definitely jaded but the phone in the car, beer with a friend losing track of time are red flags. \nHe deserved your wrath. Don\u2019t let him turn this around to where he is the victim and is mad at you.", "NTA I'd be upset too, and then he kicks your car door?!", "NTA - for several reasons, but we'll start with saying he was bringing pizza back for lunch and then ghosting you for 2 hours. I have no doubt that he realized quickly that he had left his phone in the car, and at that point he should have gone to get it. \n\nHe definitely should have considered spending some time with you for your birthday. But I'm giving him the benefit of a doubt that maybe he didn't think it would be a big deal to you. Once he made the decision to have drinks with a friend, he should have called/texted that to you right away. At that point, you would have at least had the opportunity to tell him that you would love it if you guys could do something together. \n\nKicking your car door was very immature. Not buying a gift or anything is just sad. I'm sorry. Happy Birthday to you. I hope he does better next year.", "NTA. I have to be honest I am usually on the guys side when there's a big over the top reaction for no reason. But this wasn't no reason. This was your 30th birthday which is a pretty big milestone in life and you got absolutely fuck all for it (I absolutely do not count the panic buy card and flowers which you only got AFTER you had to spell out for him that what he was doing wasn't okay) except attitude and an appalling lack of consideration. It would've broken my heart if my partner behaved that way for my milestone birthdays and I would never dream of doing something like that on her 30th. I think the N A H, Y T A and E S H people are out of their god damn minds.", "NTA. My partner never has concrete plans for his birthday and if it was up to him he won't even celebrate it. But on his birthday every year I wake him up with breakfast in bed and plan out an entire day with things that he enjoys. I love to see him smile and I make sure that he knows how special he is as a person and to me.", "NTA - I get that you\u2019ve invested a lot of time into this relationship but it\u2019s run it\u2019s course. He knew what day it was. Instead he was deliberately mean and subsequently a jerk. If he wanted to be there, he would\u2019ve.

I'm so sorry, sweetie -- the honeymoon is over and you're not even married yet.", "NTA.", "Why are you with this guy if he is so inconsiderate of your feelings and needs, and then plays the victim when you call him out?  That's no life living with that kind of toxic crap.  NTA", "So NTA.\n\nLeave him.", "Don't let him gaslight you. This is not ok. I wouldn't ever go out and drink on my significant others birthday. Who cares if you have concrete plans? You live together and it's your birthday! There is nothing else that he should be doing except making the day about you. Even if that's not your style, being around you the entire day is the absolute BARE MINIMUM that he could do and he failed that. He literally failed existence", "You are only the ah if you let this continue. He was physically violent. Please think hard about leaving him", "It makes my blood boil when someone screws up (and in this case he REALLY screwed up) and then tries to act like your reaction to their screw up is the problem. What a gaslighting, selfish jerk. You do NOT \u201close track of time\u201d on your partner\u2019s birthday. That is unacceptable. You do not make random plans with a friend on your partner\u2019s birthday and leave them hanging for hours. He SUCKS. NTA.", "NTA.  Every birthday matters, but especially a milestone birthday.  Buuuut, while are you still with this guy?  10+ years together and you are merely engaged, he plays video games for lengthy amounts of time, forgets to bring back the lunch that he went out to get for you, kicks your car door like a toddler having a tantrum, etc.", "I have to ask about leaving the phone in the car. Does he do that often? I think that is what you do when you are cheating. You don't want the wife to call when you're with the mistress, and you don't want the mistress to see the wife calling. \n\nHe knew it was your birthday,  but still stayed hours with his friend? Knowing you were waiting? Doesn't make sense unless he usually disregards you. \n\nSorry to say bad things,  but this strikes me as all wrong!!\n\nNta.", "NTA.\n\nSpeaking as someone whose ex half-assed one and actually celebrated one out of six of my birthdays, he never intended to do any more than blow you off on your birthday.  It won't change, so you'll have to ask yourself if being ignored on your birthdays by someone who claims to love you is worth the effort put into staying.", "NTA. He totally dropped the ball, which is bad enough. But then to be angry at you??", "NTA\n\nThat was inconsiderate AF. Even if it wasn\u2019t a milestone birthday, he clearly wasn\u2019t thinking about you at all.", "Who cares about the ah judgement at this point. That dude does not love or value you. The relationship is obviously dragging and lasted longer than it should. This is a wake up call. He is not in love with you. It\u2019s not petty to end over this AT ALL. It is necessary. \n\nI also dont think he left his phone in the car\u2026for two hours\u2026on your birthday\u2026after promising pizza.", "NTA...it's your birthday I call B.S. then calling more B.S. on the phone being left in the car if the situation was reversed I guarantee he would be fuming and then kicking the car after the repeated lame excuse of forgetting he wants to act like being a good and thoughtful partner that he at least brought home cold pizza and then to  tell you he's not your whipping boy,i would have said that doesn't mean what you think it means and proceed to tell him that acting like a petulant child and kicking the car door also was not fair to you and he could have used his friends phone to call you at any point so leaving the phone in the car was in fact on purpose and he got caught in a lie and rather than admit it he wants it to be your fault he needs to reevaluate and then check himself before he wrecks himself.", "\u201cHe didn\u2019t try to be inconsiderate\u201d \n\nWell he didn\u2019t try to be considerate either..?!! \n\nGee guess that selfishness just happens naturally. \n\nIt\u2019s clear he had nothing planned either.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIt doesn't matter if you had no concrete plans. It's just plain common sense to not leave the person you supposedly love, hanging on her birthday and instead meet a buddy for beers and ' lose track of time ' . And who leaves their phone in their car in 2023, seriously.", "Getting so mad he kicked your car door is a big flapping red flag with like neon lights and shit. People are allowed to be upset and angry but reacting that way is atrocious!", "NTA. Birthdays are something everyone likes to celebrate differently, and I think it's important to discover how your partner wants to spend them.  After 10 years,  you'd *think* he'd know that all you wanted was to spend some time with him and feel acknowledged by him. It's insane to me that he could actually be that selfish. It might be a good idea to really examine if this relationship is going to be a good fit for you before continuing", "NTA You need to explain to him that the reason you didn't have any concrete plans is because hes an asshole, and he didn't make any. What the hell kind of fucking partner totally ignores your 30th birthday? \n\nYeah, I still wouldn't be talking to him over this. Anyone who really genuinely loved and cared for their partner would have made plans to do something for a milestone birthday.\n\n Instead, he blew you off and went out to have drinks with his buddy and forgot all about you. Now hes got the nerve to be pissed off because you were upset with him treating you like you don'tmatter. You should show him the comments on this thread and let everyone else tell him what an asshole is.", "NTA, the liar said he was going to run errands, not hang out to have beers with friends on your bday.. He totally blew you off and is playing stupid", "NTA, 30 is a pretty significant birthday for a lot of people.", "NTA!!! I\u2019m so sorry, I really hope you can celebrate the way you want to with your friends on another day without him. Choose something special you deserve it!\n\nThis makes me so upset for you, also he kicked your car after going out for drinks on YOUR birthday without you and \u201cforgetting\u201d he was supposed to bring back lunch and then wrapped the whole fuckwittery by getting angry with you and saying you were overreacting. This man absolutely sucks! \n\nThere\u2019s someone out there that would make you a priority \ud83d\udc9d\n\nHappy belated birthday", "He OFFERED to get you lunch. It was your birthday and yes, you had plans for later other him and your family, but he asked you if you wanted pizza for lunch! \n\nHe knew when he ran into the friends that he was bringing lunch HOME to eat with YOU and that it was your BIRTHDAY! \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the plan for him to eat lunch out and bring you leftovers- it was to bring lunch home and enjoy it with you. On your BIRTHDAY. \n\nNot just any birthday, either\u2026 your 30th. That\u2019s a milestone- even if you didn\u2019t want anything huge, it\u2019s still a big deal.\n\nThen he KICKED your car door? What a giant baby. \n\nI would be pissed about that. My husband would never do that and if he did, I think I would be scared because that\u2019s really aggressive to me\u2026 but, again, my husband never acts like that, so it might just be a huge jerk/giant baby move, like I said. \n\nAnyway, this is really shitty of him and I\u2019m sorry he ruined your birthday. \n\nHappy Dirty 30! \ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf89", "NTA\n\nI think communication in some situations, to even out expectations, are needed.

And I can tell you from experience this DOES NOT CHANGE.  My DH talked a big game when we were dating but I can count on one finger the number of times he has given me any kind of gift on my birthday OR our anniversary despite me making a big deal out of him on both dates.

So property damage is a-okay in his book? This is a major red flag as it shows that he needs to take his rage out on a physical object. Will it be smashing dishes next? Moving on to living objects? You need to think hard about that behavior and whether you want to live with it for the rest of your life.", "NTA.  I can't help but wonder, was it really beer with friends or something else with someone else.  Also, he was totally gaslighting you by bringing up your reaction.  Your reaction was based on his lack of consideration.  Any loving husband would have been way more attentive, especially on his wife's birthday of all days.  It doesn't have to be any big gestures, either.", "He kicked your car.  When you call him on his crappy behavior, he gets violent.  Stop and think about that.

Birthdays are meaningless and the points don't matter.\n\nSo I'm old, long story short I've NEVER had a birthday party ... ever ... joys of being raised in a cult. On my 40th I was trying to plan a get together, not even labelled a birthday party, most people that know me don't know when my birthday is because I hate it. Honestly just wanted to go to the local bowling alley that has a bunch of different things for people to do, because fun, and they have my favorite burger and make my favorite drink to PERFECTION. Just wanted a night to chill and hang out with friends and family. Super culty family member takes it into their hands to rant and rave to everyone about how awful and terrible and selfish it was for me to make this event all about me and on 'THAT DAY' of all days, so then people start backing out ...

I don't get all the \"nta\" comments because although I understand it's your birthday, he isn't a mind reader and all he did was get a couple of beers.

If you don\u2019t actually communicate your expectations to your partner, you can\u2019t assume they know what they are. Yes, it would be nice if sometimes people did things just to be nice, but the reality is that most people need to be told what is expected of them. Getting mad at someone for not reading your mind is a fruitless endeavor.

I'll explain when I get there.\" He turned up about 15 minutes later with a pizza box in hand and as it turns out, he went out for two beers with a friend and \"lost track of time\". Reddit, I was MAD. I walked to my car, told him he was no longer invited to dinner, got in the car and locked the door. He tried to open it and I just said \"No, you're not going.\" He kicked my car door and walked inside. He called me after I left and I really laid into him for leaving me hanging on my birthday. Also, for not even getting me so much as a card. I told him it was ridiculous for him to leave me hanging for lunch he had promised, not telling me where he was going and that he was inconsiderate. I was heated because of his 'it was no big deal' reaction and kicking my car door! I did yell and I wasn't nice. \n\nI went to dinner with my parents and came home around 10 to flowers and a card on the table. I immediately went to bed. \n\nWhen we talked about it, he was really upset over the way I spoke to him on the phone. He said he would not be my \"whipping boy\" and that my reaction was unacceptable. He continued to say he lost track of time and left his phone in the car. He said he didn't try to be inconsiderate and didn't think it was an issue because we didn't have any concrete plans... I just expected that he would want to spend time together and would at least get me something? But beers with a friend? That seems really rude. \n\nAITA for expecting some communication, consideration or something more? I know birthdays were never a big deal to his family, but he's never snubbed me like this!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've had that issue before & it's way easier to just talk upfront rather than deal with unspoken expectations.

If we were messaging I would receive paragraphs with him going on about how it was me just misunderstanding him, he would often negate an apology in one sentence by apologizing and always following it up with a \"but\" right afterwards. Like dude, we all make mistakes. Just apologize and move on. He would sometimes do stuff like OP's fiance did with flowers and a card or something of the like, but ya know what? It was a never-ending cycle. I'd rather just get a genuine apology and not have a repetitive cycle of shitty behavior. The apologies definitely improved over time, and would start to sound more genuine, but the behavior? It stayed the same. We were in our late 20s and honestly he was just too immature to be in a relationship. I learned the hard way that accepting his apologies in the relationship were, in his mind, a way of just validating his behavior.\n\n OP, you guys have been together for awhile. There's just no excuse for this kind of behavior whatsoever. Hang in there and I wish you the very best moving forward.\n\nEdit: a word", "30 was big for my husband and I! We were living in Hawaii so we did 10 days at the Big Island for me and then later in the year Maui for him!", "While I can agree, there's also another angle. When did he leave? Right before the call. Did he knew it was an exactly 1 hour call? Was it exactly 1 hour call? Are these type of call often go over the one hour? This is important. Why? Well if most of the time these call take 1h30 or 2h and I go out right before it start, well I don't see any reason to come back in an hour and I'll find something to kill time like to see a friend.\n\nNow rest of the day was cyberpunk.

In the moment, I was really heated and hangry and I thought having him come to dinner would have made things more awkward with tension in the air. It wasn't just something I could move past in that moment and I was on a time crunch to leave and get there in time. Seeing him get out of the car without even a card hurt a lot. I was shocked when I saw him and then I just wanted to be with my family for the evening. \n\nHe could have played video games all day for all I cared. The company would have just been nice.

I didn't consider that setting the tone for the day, but that is a really good point. We spent time together prior to that and that's when the quality time ended. That gave me some insight so thank you for taking the time to comment.", "I don't think it's her job to set the tone. Even with the work call, he could've asked her if she wanted to do anything. Again, after all these years together, you don't get your fiance a gift or card or even ask if there is anything she wanted to do? Or check in if she's cool with you going out before a dinner? I don't think her expecting or assuming that her fiance will do anything is inherently crappy. It's a birthday of a woman he's been with for years. The least he could've done was asked if OP wanted to do anything or if she was cool with him stepping out if she didn't want to do anything. I'm not trying to come for you I just dont think it's crappy to have expectations when it's pretty normal to expect your SO to do something to recognize its their special day.

Hey thanks I don't need your bs pity to try to coax me into an apology.", "eh i think it makes sense if you use it more metaphorically, like, OP was mad at turning thirty/not being the center of attention (which she wasn't) and took it out on him instead of (the prince) something intangible like depression/feeling angry. \n\nofc, this interpretation also absolves him of any part in the matter so it's a stupid thing to say but makes sense if he's selfish and doesnt take responsibility for his part in her anger.", "The thing is, whenever a \"small\" situation makes you rethink the relationship, it's not that you're being unreasonable--you have been experiencing more and more hurtful things until it reaches a breaking point. This is the straw that broke the camel's back.", "You should be questioning this because he showed you exactly how much he cares, which is not at all. NTA. But you deserve better than this", "Kicking the car door and turning the tables on you, especially the \"whipping boy\" comment are all just signs of him knowing he F'd up, and rather than say sorry his pride got in the way. Anger and bullying manipulation tactics rather than admitting he was wrong, it's not a good look. \n\nHonestly, look back at your relationship, has he ever displayed signs like this before that you've brushed off, or was this a one off? If it's not a pattern, it could be down to stress and not communicating it, but if this \"I'm never wrong and you're controlling me\" mentality is something he's used repeatedly in the past that's a red flag that should not be ignored.", "I\u2019m going to use the word boggled more often now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acting entitled to expect your boyfriend to prioritize you on your birthday. I mean if you care/love someone wouldn\u2019t you want to make them feel extra special on a day like their birthday?? Even if he grew up in a house where birthdays weren\u2019t a big deal, I mean he had to have seen every other kid treating them like a big deal.", "Two things OP.  Look at [this](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/darvo/) and see if it fits your situation. From your post and comments, I think you may find your relationship in here.   \nSecondly, he said, he \u201cdidn\u2019t try to be inconsiderate.\u201d Does he know the meaning of the word? He wasn\u2019t *considering* you at all. Not your feelings, not your plans for dinner. He was only *considering* himself*.*   \n\n\nIf your sister or best friend found herself in a situation like yours, what advice would you give her?", "I like to think it's a reasonable counterweight to the bias of others.", "It really did. I don't care about gifts, it was the fact he forgot.", "Tbf this doesn't seem like high expectations to me. You expected him to not randomly go out with a friend for a few hours on your birthday without talking to you at all about it. It's weird that he thinks spending time with you on your birthday is a totally unexpected want. He messed up and should've apologized.", "I am glad it was useful. Full disclosure, I work in communications, my fields are interpersonal and conflict resolution. I am a little concerned here that you might be holding back on telling him what  you want/need because of either his reaction to it, or because you don't feel you are allowed. How much of the burden of the relationship do you shoulder?  Do you usually defer to what he wants? I also wonder if you were the one in your family who kept the peace, made sure everyone got along?  I admire you for sticking with the relationship, but you both deserve a better one - and the good news is that you could have that together, and how great would that be?", "This! I was so disturbed when I read this.", "Exactly! Do not fall into the 'sunk cost fallacy' idea. This behavior is enough to at least put a halt to any wedding planning for now. I would not want to be married to someone who treated me this way regardless of whether it was my birthday or not. Telling me you're bringing home lunch and then not show up for over two hours because you lost track of time? Bullshit.", "\"Men don't take the time to end things. They ignore you until you insist on a declaration of hate\"- Joan Holloway Harris", "The fact that he throws things and kicked your car door is a red flag. He messed up and couldn't apologize. That's also not a sign of maturity. \n\nNTA but maybe it's time to go into your 30s single", "this comes off as really weird", "Yeah I call bs, who *especially in this age bracket* \u2018forgets\u2019 their phone in the car?", "What are you doing about these red flags? Are you just going to continue to accept them? I would definitely reconsider the relationship based on his complete lack of effort AND being shady by disappearing. On your birthday.", "NTA. And you should show him all these comments. Sometimes men don\u2019t get it. But that\u2019s No Excuse.", "Some people try to sabotage  life\u2019s big events. Is it possible he\u2019s one of them?", "Dump him. Breaking or throwing/kicking objects, kicking car doors.... it's a bad sign that shows he can't handle stress or anger without physically lashing out. You don't need that in your life, for your own well-being and safety.", "The reason that escalating yelling and destroying things is a red flag is because doing it when angry at you is a silent \"I could destroy you like I did this object.\" It's a threat and one you should take seriously--even if he never puts his hands on you, being in a volatile relationship erodes your support system, relationship, self-worth, and sense of safety.", "There's a free pdf of [Why does he do that?](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf) Considering he throws things and kicks chairs, you should probably read it. Definitely keep in mind this violent behavior will likely escalate over time.", "OP, it's not \"He hasn't laid his hands on you.\" it's \"He hasn't laid his hands on you ***YET.*** Make a plan and get out. Please.", "I'm so sorry your husband abuses you.   Being a domestic violence victim is so many levels of stress.  I hope he seeks treatment or you get away somehow.", "Do you think this instance might be a really great example of why he isn't deserving of that trust? It doesn't even have to be about him cheating on you. He intentionally lied by omission about what he was doing, *kicked your car door which you are not reacting to enough*, and then blamed you for his fuckery. How long is it going to take to get trust back after this bullshit?", "Run! This is a huge red flag. It won\u2019t get better."]}
