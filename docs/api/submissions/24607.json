Once I got to the bathroom I knocked on the door and informed my wife that it was me at the door. \n\nAfter a few minutes i heard the door unlock and open. When I got in a saw my wife sitting on the floor with mascara running down her cheeks. \n\nI asked what was wrong and she told me that one of our nephews was wearing white jeans and a white bow tie. I immediately thought to myself how she was completely over re acting because he\u2019s a six year old child and had no idea that you can\u2019t wear white to a wedding. \n\nI told her she was over re acting but in a much nicer way and I said that she should go enjoy the reception and forget about the whole thing. She eventually texted her sister to come to the bathroom and fix her makeup so she could go back out and have a good night. \n\nAfter a while I saw her talking to my sister, the mom of our nephew, and I thought she was just making conversation. About an hour later my sister pulled me aside and berated me for my wife\u2019s behaviour. She said my wife had asked her and her son to leave unless she had a change of clothes for him. \n\nThis was far from okay to me so I asked my wife to talk and explained everything my sister told me, my wife said she was completely in the right for what she asked and i told her that if she kicks my family out then I will happily leave too. My wife started crying again and saying that this is her day and she doesn\u2019t want it to be ruined by our nephew. This angered me because I had enough of her ruining our day over something silly. I then said she was not only selfish but that she was insanely insecure if she\u2019s worried about a six year old looking better than her. \n\nMy wife\u2019s been staying with her mother since the wedding and we haven\u2019t spoken once. Her mom reached out to me this morning and said that I need to apologise right away for being \u201cout of line\u201d\n\n\nI really don\u2019t believe i\u2019m in the wrong here so what do you think?

Regardless, telling your sister and nephew to live is way out of line. She seemed to forget that it's your day too and your sister is an important part of your special day.

She confided in you and you invalidated her feelings and insulted her. You could have said \"you look beautiful come dance with me and let's ignore the white pants\". This response would have shown compassion, empathy, and support. You are no longer going to be seen as someone she can trust to be on her side or in her corner. She will feel as if you will be negative towards her in even more serious situations and she will hold resentment for this move forever. Your  unwillingness to even contact her has proven to her further that you do not care about her and that she cannot rely on you. Your marriage is over even before it began whether she was acting silly or not, your reaction is what ruined everything.

She clearly put a lot of work and effort into the wedding that the slightest thing upset her. But in the end, it's supposed to be a happy day and she needs to chill tf out. Kicking out a literal 6 year old is going way too far. This is not a good sign.", "Hell no, you are NOT the asshole! The fact that your mother-in-law is trying to make you apologize is a bit ridiculous because its y'alls issue, not her's. Simply from the fact this is your family makes this more difficult. Essentially, you're being asked to choose between your blood and her feelings. Some women love trying to make men make decisions they would never make themselves.\n\nAnd I don't mean to sound like a dick when I say this because I mean no disrespect, but it seems she wanted the wedding more than the marriage if she let that ruin y'alls day.\n\nAs men, we aren't too worried about weddings, but she didn't take into account how this would make you feel. As soon as you asked the question, it was all about her and not the both of you. \n\nThis is just my opinion. But no, my brotha, you are NOT the asshole!", "NTA\n\nDo you really want to deal with this drama queen for the rest of your life?", "Ok I have my fingers crossed hoping this is fiction because I cannot imagine an adult woman being this petty and immature. You're definitely NTA. \n\nFirst of all, it's not \"her day\".. it's supposed to be \"both of your\" day.. she actively ruined your day even after you helped her calm down and move on. She acted like a child and ruined her own day.. the selfishness and hypocrisy on her part is just mind blowing.. \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.. she berated your sister there and then.. what did she expect would happen..? She could have asked you to talk to your sister instead. Or she could have enjoyed her day and brought this up later on. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.. and **if you start apologizing and accept being guilt tripped into doing things from the first day of your marriage, that is what the rest of your life will be**. **Do not set a precedent for such crappy behaviour and stand your ground**. Giving into such immature behaviour where your partner refuses to take responsibility for her actions and hold herself accountable isn't healthy for any relationship. Not to mention she dragged her family into this, something which could have been settled between you two. As for her mother, tell her that your wife crossed the line when she asked your family to leave your wedding over a 6 year old's clothes and that you expect an apology from her (to both you and your sister) if she wants to work on your relationship. \n\nWhen people show you who they are, believe them. Do you want such pettiness in your life. Imagine other events also being ruined like this. SIL's food is better than mine in the family gathering, SIL's kids have better clothes, my baby shower cannot have SIL etc etc.. You tolerate this behaviour now, you'll have to tolerate it forever. Tell your wife exactly that. Tell her she has the option of apologizing to your sister and then working on your relationship and nothing less will be accepted.

Imagine ruining your day because of what's basically a trifling matter.", "I'm not saying it wasn't over the top or that the following absolutely applies in every situation but try to remember to be compassionate because usually the wedding is a huge deal for the bride, it is all resting on her head to make the day perfect since often men take a back seat in the planning. Hundreds of hours of unpaid work to plan a huge party that must go off without a hitch and then someone you care about doesn't follow the rules and it's emotional - why would they be so inconsiderate to the bride after all the work they put in to throw their friends and family a huge celebration that will be remembered by all forever! You might not agree but that can be an awful lot of pressure and tears from stress seem inevitable!", "You're not wrong; but you're kinda leaving out that the one person putting most of that stress on the bride is the bride herself. It's almost entirely on her to take a step back and not put the expectation of a perfect day on herself and everyone else. She could just have chosen to let it go, but she had to make it drama.\n\nAlso, the fact that she calls it \"my day\" and not \"our day\" kinda sours me against her, tbh. It should be the common day of the bride and groom, and not her day to be everyone's princess.", "The fact remains that it's a 6 year old in a white jeans. It simply doesn't matter if you use the smallest bit of logic. If your emotions are this unstable and overpowering then something is definitely wrong."]}
