Once I got to the bathroom I knocked on the door and informed my wife that it was me at the door. \n\nAfter a few minutes i heard the door unlock and open. When I got in a saw my wife sitting on the floor with mascara running down her cheeks. \n\nI asked what was wrong and she told me that one of our nephews was wearing white jeans and a white bow tie. I immediately thought to myself how she was completely over re acting because he\u2019s a six year old child and had no idea that you can\u2019t wear white to a wedding. \n\nI told her she was over re acting but in a much nicer way and I said that she should go enjoy the reception and forget about the whole thing. She eventually texted her sister to come to the bathroom and fix her makeup so she could go back out and have a good night. \n\nAfter a while I saw her talking to my sister, the mom of our nephew, and I thought she was just making conversation. About an hour later my sister pulled me aside and berated me for my wife\u2019s behaviour. She said my wife had asked her and her son to leave unless she had a change of clothes for him. \n\nThis was far from okay to me so I asked my wife to talk and explained everything my sister told me, my wife said she was completely in the right for what she asked and i told her that if she kicks my family out then I will happily leave too. My wife started crying again and saying that this is her day and she doesn\u2019t want it to be ruined by our nephew. This angered me because I had enough of her ruining our day over something silly. I then said she was not only selfish but that she was insanely insecure if she\u2019s worried about a six year old looking better than her. \n\nMy wife\u2019s been staying with her mother since the wedding and we haven\u2019t spoken once. Her mom reached out to me this morning and said that I need to apologise right away for being \u201cout of line\u201d\n\n\nI really don\u2019t believe i\u2019m in the wrong here so what do you think?

I got married on Dec. 29, 2021, it was a Wednesday.  The venue was 40% higher in price on a Fri/Sat/Sun.  Discounts on the DJ and caterer as well.", "But not so many colors that all ready work with the suits men have in their closets. It is a wedding but if I have to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe, it isn't going to happen.", "If they were his favourite, they may have started out white, but I promise they didn't stay that way. \n\nBut still, it is on the parents to, I don't know, parent the child, no?", "I raised 3 boys.  White is the easiest to clean. You just throw the bleach in with the whites.  My kids wow it all the time.", "Please go outside and touch some grass. Not everything is \u201cincel rhetoric\u201d. Normal people use words too. Only the terminally online are hyperfixated on one single word looking to call a random dude on the internet an incel", "Not over a 6 y/o ffs.  She\u2019s unhinged.", "Lol she threw multiple temper tantrums over a little boys pants. That\u2019s not mentally stable.", "A grown ass woman wore a white lace dress to my sister's wedding and I almost... Never mind I don't want to get kicked out of here. Lol", "Dude, come on. Everyone knows the rule against white applies to women. Not little kids. No sane person would reasonably expect dressing their 6yo in white jeans would go against that.", "My toddler wears a lot of white. It\u2019s no harder to clean than other colors. Sometimes easier because you can bleach a stain. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t disrespectful, the bride is off her rocker. Hope he annuls this, can you imagine what she\u2019d be like if a baby did something cute at her baby shower? She\u2019d probably become violent.", "For a nice event indoors? And a kid who\u2019s not particularly inclined toward the messier side of the spectrum? Sure some people will buy white clothes for their kid. What\u2019s he gonna do to em at a wedding? Spill his wine in his lap? He\u2019s six, he\u2019s not even gonna be drinking wine.", "LOL I\u2019m sorry there is seriously no excuse for a bride to get that upset over a little 6 yr old boy wearing white jeans and a bow tie. Plus, the little boy is her new husbands nephew to boot. She even had the audacity to ask his sister and nephew to leave. That\u2019s just crazy talking.", "If you\u2019re from the south then the idea of jeans (usually not white) with a bow tie is absolutely on trend and a respectable outfit for anyone at a wedding.  Most wedding i attend (Texas) most of the men are in jeans and bow ties with jackets.  Even black tie events here it\u2019s not uncommon for some men to wear jeans anyway\u2026.black jeans with jacket, bow tie, and cowboy hats!", "Have literally never been to a wedding where men weren't wearing white shirts, there's essentially no other formal shirt colors for us but white and light blue.", "are you aware of how many flower girl dresses are specifically made in white?\n\nits not a hard and fast rule for all attendees, especially children.", "Listen, dress shirts for men are white. Accents like bow ties are white. Pants are even white. This is a kid who wore a pair of white jeans and a white bow tie, presumably with a different colored shirt. FFS, the wife is completely off her rocker. NTA, OP", "I always remind myself we are only seeing it from his very limited perspective. Also there was no context given in terms of the relationship with the in-laws or even really the conversation other then the bride told them to change the child or leave.", ">Have you thought maybe that\u2019s what the 6 year old wanted to wear?\n\n\"Hey hunny, I know, but listen. Weddings aren't a good place for jeans. And there's going to be lots of snacks, so I'd really rather you wear a different pair of pants so they don't get dirty. Okay?\" \n\nSeriously - let's not act like 6 year olds dress themselves entirely without any input or reasoning from parents. And even if they do on a regular basis, it was still on mom and dad to regulate the kid.", "Yeah I mean\u2026 that\u2019s why I brought up the way I reacted cause her reaction is obviously disproportionate.", "They should honestly just anull the marriage. Weddings have things that happen that will dissapoint you but it strikes me that she wasn\u2019t too  concerned about her husbands happiness.", "Almost had a red wine accident?", "Yeah, don\u2019t men wear white shirts to weddings with their suits or tuxes?", "Two young boys at a friend\u2019s wedding ended up in the hotel pond. 6 year olds shouldn\u2019t wear white for logistical reasons - methinks the sister was being funny.", "Obviously 6 years don\u2019t get to dress themselves. Maybe this 6 year doesn\u2019t get that messy. Maybe this one promised not to get messy because he was grown up enough to pick this fancy white jeans. Maybe mom doesn\u2019t care if he gets messy. It\u2019s a 6 year old boy. Who cares if he is wearing jeans. For the love of God at no point should be bride be upset about a 6 year old wearing white jeans. Lord have mercy.", "I hate to be that person but she sobbed over jeans on a baby and then trounced off to her parents house. Yuck. Just end it before you\u2019ve got two kids.", "That, too. I have a hard time believing not one guy wore a white shirt.", "Yeah I know Reddit goes straight to divorce a little too often but this one seems obviously disfunctional."]}
