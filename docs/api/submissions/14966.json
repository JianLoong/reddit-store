It wasn't messy and we still remain on good terms but it can be messy at times. She is a 29 year old mom that won't work more than two days a week so that she can get the maximum government assistance and demands I pay child support and won't let me be the primary care provider despite not needing any assistance to do that. That's fine, whatever. I am okay with paying because it helps elevate the kids life at her place but it is a point of tension as if I was the primary I wouldn't need her child support, would be able to stick to a schedule, and could lift my kid out of poverty. \n\nThat brings us to the current situation. She won't get us on a well defined custody schedule and we don't want courts involved in our daughter's life. We have it sort of planned out where I get her on Sunday around 4 and then keep her till after school Monday, then get her back Tuesday morning to take her to school and she goes back to her mom's alone Wednesday at 6 where she usually stays till Sunday. I would prefer to have her more and sometimes I get her between Thurs-Sat but I never actually know when I'm getting her on those days till about an hour before. This makes it really hard to plan for having her and it's a constant battle to get her to give me more than an hour notice that my kid is coming over. There is only one time during the week I say I'm completely unavailable and it's Sunday from 1-3. I have planned social events during that time and it's the only time I have planned with friends at all. She thinks this is unacceptable and thinks I'm being a shitty dad by saying I'm unavailable for that time saying that I don't get to control every Sunday. \n\nSo AITA? Sure the thing I have planned is just social but it's the only planned social time I have with friends. I even said I'm ok cancelling sometimes but need more than same day notice. She thinks because it's social it doesn't matter and thinks that she should be allowed to do stuff during that time too and is going as far to say that I now have to cancel every other event - which would actually cancel it for the other five people involved as well. I think I could be the asshole because it involves my kid and she makes me feel like I'm neglecting my dad responsibilities but I argue it's only 3 hours a week I'm unavailable - I even work from home so she can be here any other time as long as I'm not busy and know she's going to be here.", "created_utc": 1681663045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ogg7g/aita_for_saying_that_im_completely_unavailable/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When dads seek equal custody, they usually get it. The default in most places is 50-50, and generally the reason moms tend to have more custody is that both parents agreed to a plan where she has more time, because of work schedules/she was the primary caregiver. The standard in family courts is the best interests of the child, and generally, unless there is something VERY serious going on with one of the parents, the belief is that having both parents in a child's life is best for that child, and typically, unless the parents both agree to something else or there is a compelling reason why one parent should have significantly more custody time (such as the other parent is traveling for work for weeks at a time or something), or the parents live so far apart it wouldn't work for school, the court will look to do 50-50.\n\nETA: I do not practice family law and this is not legal advice, I just got interested awhile ago and looked up a bunch of research and statistics on it.", "You talk about wanting to avoid resentment but the fact your ex is being such a pain will build resentment on its own.

Let's be real, you need a proper schedule that she sticks to. This might be at the cost of you being 'friendly' but would mean your daughter knows clearly what days she is with mum and what days she's with dad. It's not fair to her to keep bouncing her around. Maybe speak to your ex and say to her if she won't agree official days then the only alternative is to go to court and have someone else set that agreement for you. What you are doing now is not working for anyone.", "You already aren't doing things together! You're giving her all the benefits of not having to work more than part time while collecting aide while getting as much CS as she can convince you to pay. You are at her beck and call, and the fight about Sundays is a fight about you putting out a boundary for yourself, not about you being a bad dad.\n\nBut you are failing your daughter. She has no stability in this environment, and that's going to cause issues for her as she grows older. You're also not modeling a healthy, friendly co-parenting relationship.

If she truly thought it was about doing what is best for your daughter, she'd let you have custody and she'd take visitation.\n\nGet the courts involved.  They will get a guardian/attorney ad litem assigned to protect your daughter's interest.  That person will look at your ability to care for your daughter and at her mother's ability to care for her.

Also, if you have to pay child support, you can have your attorney make it payable to the register of the court.  That way, baby momma pays for stuff for your child, then gets reimbursed for it when she presents receipts.  That way, all your money really is spent on your child.  Any unused funds remain with the court and can be used in ensuing months.  For example, you pay $400/mo.  In April, mom only presents $250 in receipts.  She gets $250 and the remaining $150 stays with the court.  May 1st, you pay another $400 to the court, bringing the total to $550.  Kid needs a new mitt for t-ball and mom presents $475 in receipts.  Mom is reimbursed $475 and the remaining $75 stays with the court.\n\nReally, getting the courts involved is the best way to go about this.

Also, sorry for defaulting to thinking you\u2019re in the US, but if she is on government assistance and not reporting the child support income she receives, you may be on the hook for repaying the government for any cash assistance paid for your child. Go to court and enforce a custody agreement. Keep a record of her compliance. You can also fight her on being your child\u2019s primary caregiver. Why wouldn\u2019t you?", "NTA. You\u2019re a parent, yes, but you\u2019re also a person. You having a social life is good for your mental health. \n\nSpeaking of which, your current arrangement is *only* benefitting your ex. It\u2019s incredibly insecure your your kid to not really know where she\u2019s sleeping on any given day. I get wanting to avoid the courts \u2014 others have suggested mediation. If that\u2019s a possibility, please consider doing it.", "You need a lawyer and to go through the court to establish a custody schedule, not AITA. If she doesn't want to do that it's her problem, you need to provide stability for your child and do what's best for them, not what's best for you or your ex.", "NTA. You\u2019re pretty much open to any other day, time and want to be in daughter\u2019s life. That\u2019s not an ass-hole move, especially since the time window is so small.", "If this is the US and you haven't gone through the courts for child support then you're going to get screwed because the government will eventually come after you for what it's put out on behalf of your child. Go for full custody or YTA.", "ESH go to court and get a formal custody arrangement this is worse for your kid than a clearly defined structure", "She just doesn't want the court involved because she knows she will lose.

Sounds to me like baby mama also wants the same time for her reasons.", "YTA for not getting a getting the court defined schedule. \n\nProtect your kid by first protecting yourself.", "So for your specific question NTA. The boundary is reasonable given your current situation. You are however a gigantic AH to your child for not having a formal custody arrangement. This leaves her with so much additional risk jn terms of unpredictability and lack of stability. Get a formal agreement. Go for the actual custody arrangement you think is best for your child. For goodness sake you wrote that you want more custody to lift your child out of poverty. The only thing actually standing in the way is YOU! Get a decent lawyer. Go to court. Make sure your kid has all the legal protections she deserves.", "You need to go to court, not for your sake but for the kid. It\u2019s not goo for her to have inconsistent time with each parent.", "You're divorced so this seems as simple as 'no, this doesn't work for me. Either we agree on a schedule together or I will let the courts decide on one for us.\"", "NTA if that's how it's going down, but dude --- you'll win custody because the courts really only care what is best for the child.

That is the ONLY way you are going to have 100% guaranteed time with your child.", "NTA\n\nBut - this schedule sounds hectic and awful for your child. Go to court and get a defined schedule, or apply for full custody. Your child deserves to know where they will sleep, and to have some routine in their lives.", "Yta.  You want the middle of day on Sunday free every single weekend?  That\u2019s insane.", "NTA but honestly go to court and get a defined custody schedule. You may be entitled to more time with your daughter. As for those 3 hours on Sunday, you\u2019re entitled to socialize but you are also a parent. If I want to socialize I need to arrange childcare with my daughter. Set up a firm custody schedule, go to court so it cannot change at your ex\u2019s whims. Arrange your social time for non-custodial time. Obviously in an emergency you would drop everything to help your daughter. Otherwise, it\u2019s your ex\u2019s custody time and she will need to figure out childcare on her own.", "You may not want the court involved, but it sounds like the best thing for your child is exactly that.

Everyone will benefit by the sounds of it.", "ESH\n\nYou need to go to court and get a stable custody arrangement before this comes to a head, which it will. Your kid doesn\u2019t need to be there if that makes it feel better for you. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t need to go to court if she\u2019d just agree to a schedule, but she wont.

That\u2019s what makes you an asshole.", "NTA. Go to court and get this settled properly.", "NTA here but you need to get the courts involved on your child\u2019s behalf, because otherwise a defined custody schedule is never going to get ironed out with your ex. A court can mandate a proper schedule that works for both of you, then if the mom has issues you can remind her the judge approved the schedule.", "NTA. I see my daughter every other weekend from Friday 6pm to Sunday 6pm and Wednesday\u2019s from 4-8. Go spend 3k on lawyer to get Custody schedule in writing. Best money I\u2019ve ever spent. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad when you say no btw. You made plans on a day you didn\u2019t have your daughter. Not your fault at all. You sound like a great dad.

This is honestly above Reddit's pay grade and while I know you don't want the courts involved, I regret to inform you that you're probably going to want to get them involved.", "This.

Contact a family law attorney and pay a retainer,  and get it properly taken care of.

Get your ass in gear and get an official order.***\n\nESH except your poor kid.", "This is the dumbest response I\u2019ve read. You want a defined schedule. The only mechanism to get a defined schedule is a COURT ORDER. \u201cI really don\u2019t want courts tied up in my daughter\u2019s life\u201d is uninformed and, frankly, very stupid. Meet with an actual lawyer and get educated. Source: a lawyer with very little patience for dumb shenanigans.", ">We don't want courts invovled\n\nOkay, and as you have VERY CLEARLY seen the result is your daughter's mother isn't stepping up and doing just about anything, you mention in other comments the mother abused you and because of her desire to have a no working lifestyle while with her your daughter is living in \"poverty\". Yes, court can be daunting and undesirable but you need to accept that by not doing it your saying your content with your daughter living like that and with someone like that and isn't worth that extra effort.", "Why don\u2019t you want weekend days with your child? End of day Sunday-Wednesday, are you off work those days? This doesn\u2019t make sense if you want to have your child more. She\u2019s in school Mon-Fri I assume based off your post. I work weekdays so my weekend time with my kids is very important to me. That\u2019s when we have the most fun!", "*Sometimes* not constantly. Some parents will use last minute visitation as an attempt to control an ex's schedule or access to children. The father in this situation regularly agrees to custody at the last minute and the mother in this situation knows that he has a social activity scheduled for a certain time on a certain day. Why are her activities that cause her to ask him to assume custody at the last minute not under question?\n\nThat being said, ESH. This is an incredibly disruptive schedule for your child. Week on week off or rotating weekends would be better for her especially as she gets older and you can still agree to last minute custody arrangements outside of your time if you want. You may have to go to every other Sunday for your activity or schedule it for a different day when it falls during your custody window. Your kid also deserves weekend bonding time with both of you.", "With the right lawyer, a good lawyer, they will not subject your child to someone who was and is a narcissistic abuser. That is exactly what the judge is here to prevent. You just have to prove it, and a good lawyer will know how to do this. Not to be a little cynical but she doesn't have the money to fight a losing battle like this. You got yourself out which means you are a very strong human being. Go get your kid out. It's scary but you can do this.", "The courts exist to protect your child from this endless squabbling between you and your ex and actually attempt to do what's best for her", "That gives me hope for my case, tbh.", "Yeah, at this point unless OP has a good reason \"to not involve the courts\" in the very thing they exist to do, then he's being an AH to himself and his daughter by allowing this to go on.\n\nBut you're NTA for keeping your DnD (or whatever) group going and setting that time aside for yourself.  Three hours a week is more than reasonable.", "I\u2019d highly recommend getting legal counsel if you can at all afford it. Many family law attorneys offer certain services on a flat fee basis (certain amount of work, or up to a certain point in the case, for one set price). Also, some employers offer legal insurance plans as an opt in benefit so maybe inquire as to that option as well. \n\nA fair and well contemplated parenting plan is in everyone\u2019s best interest ESPECIALLY your child(ren)\u2019s.", "My ex and I are on good enough terms that we've agreed to everything and have had an arrangement in place that works and is in writing.

I\u2019ll copy here what I put in a comment to OP:  \n\n> IANAL but I work in family law and see cases like yours every day...\n> Be sure to consider all the things you feel are necessary (school schedule, summer, holidays, transportation, access to records and info, new partners, joint/sole decision making: travel? phone/social media? Healthcare? Car? childcare?) and potential avenues for future conflict because parenting plans get harder to change once they\u2019re signed by a judicial officer."]}
