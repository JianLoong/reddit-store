It wasn't messy and we still remain on good terms but it can be messy at times. She is a 29 year old mom that won't work more than two days a week so that she can get the maximum government assistance and demands I pay child support and won't let me be the primary care provider despite not needing any assistance to do that. That's fine, whatever. I am okay with paying because it helps elevate the kids life at her place but it is a point of tension as if I was the primary I wouldn't need her child support, would be able to stick to a schedule, and could lift my kid out of poverty. \n\nThat brings us to the current situation. She won't get us on a well defined custody schedule and we don't want courts involved in our daughter's life. We have it sort of planned out where I get her on Sunday around 4 and then keep her till after school Monday, then get her back Tuesday morning to take her to school and she goes back to her mom's alone Wednesday at 6 where she usually stays till Sunday. I would prefer to have her more and sometimes I get her between Thurs-Sat but I never actually know when I'm getting her on those days till about an hour before. This makes it really hard to plan for having her and it's a constant battle to get her to give me more than an hour notice that my kid is coming over. There is only one time during the week I say I'm completely unavailable and it's Sunday from 1-3. I have planned social events during that time and it's the only time I have planned with friends at all. She thinks this is unacceptable and thinks I'm being a shitty dad by saying I'm unavailable for that time saying that I don't get to control every Sunday. \n\nSo AITA? Sure the thing I have planned is just social but it's the only planned social time I have with friends. I even said I'm ok cancelling sometimes but need more than same day notice. She thinks because it's social it doesn't matter and thinks that she should be allowed to do stuff during that time too and is going as far to say that I now have to cancel every other event - which would actually cancel it for the other five people involved as well. I think I could be the asshole because it involves my kid and she makes me feel like I'm neglecting my dad responsibilities but I argue it's only 3 hours a week I'm unavailable - I even work from home so she can be here any other time as long as I'm not busy and know she's going to be here.", "created_utc": 1681663045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ogg7g/aita_for_saying_that_im_completely_unavailable/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When dads seek equal custody, they usually get it. The default in most places is 50-50, and generally the reason moms tend to have more custody is that both parents agreed to a plan where she has more time, because of work schedules/she was the primary caregiver. The standard in family courts is the best interests of the child, and generally, unless there is something VERY serious going on with one of the parents, the belief is that having both parents in a child's life is best for that child, and typically, unless the parents both agree to something else or there is a compelling reason why one parent should have significantly more custody time (such as the other parent is traveling for work for weeks at a time or something), or the parents live so far apart it wouldn't work for school, the court will look to do 50-50.\n\nETA: I do not practice family law and this is not legal advice, I just got interested awhile ago and looked up a bunch of research and statistics on it.", "You talk about wanting to avoid resentment but the fact your ex is being such a pain will build resentment on its own. Who is she to say when you can and can't do things socially. You aren't together. So long as you aren't palming your daughter off on others on 'your time', then it's nothing to do with her. Let's be real, you need a proper schedule that she sticks to. This might be at the cost of you being 'friendly' but would mean your daughter knows clearly what days she is with mum and what days she's with dad. It's not fair to her to keep bouncing her around. Maybe speak to your ex and say to her if she won't agree official days then the only alternative is to go to court and have someone else set that agreement for you. What you are doing now is not working for anyone.", "You already aren't doing things together! You're giving her all the benefits of not having to work more than part time while collecting aide while getting as much CS as she can convince you to pay. You are at her beck and call, and the fight about Sundays is a fight about you putting out a boundary for yourself, not about you being a bad dad.\n\nBut you are failing your daughter. She has no stability in this environment, and that's going to cause issues for her as she grows older. You're also not modeling a healthy, friendly co-parenting relationship. This one seems combative and controlling to the point where you're still involved only so that you can provide free childcare at a moment's notice. Is that what you want to be for the next thirteen years?\n\nIf you need help justifying the costs of court, add up what you'd save in CS for a year if custody went to 50/50. Or if you won primary custody. I'm thinking court costs are cheaper in the long run. Especially once your ex figures out how to milk you for more money.", "It cost me absolutely nothing to go to court. They have free lawyers to use if your in the US", "Can't you speak to a family lawyer or something similar first? If you want to avoid court or afraid they side with your Ex, then please get an appointment with a lawyer or a family counseler.", "Where is the friendship?  She's demanding child support from you and purposefully working as little as she can.  She's refusing to amicably co-parent by agreeing to a custody schedule you both come to.  She gives you almost no notice and thinks you should cancel your plans.  None of this sounds like two people co-parenting in a friendly and healthy way for the sake of their child, it sounds more like you catering to her because you want to see your daughter.  If after a year you two can't work this out then someone outside your relationship has to.", ">The resentment and destroying the friendship and ability to do things together for our daughter are other parts of it.\n\nThis is happening now in ways it wouldn't if you had a court-approved schedule.", "I paid $250 to have a paralegal help me draft a parenting plan with my ex. Spent maybe $50 to file it with court. If your ex is willing to sign it gets accepted and that's what's followed,  easy-peasy. If not, go to court, neither of you are required to have attorneys. The judge will almost always just do a 50/50 agreement unless one party can PROVE why doing so would be detrimental to the child.  A statement of \"I feel she's better of with me\" isn't an excuse nor proof.", "My divorce was 6 years ago so I'm sure costs have changed.  If you guys agree upfront, you don't even need to go to mediation.  I'd just check with your local court about how much it would be to file the paperwork. I think it was a couple hundred for the parenting plan part of it.", "Mediation is worthless if both parents don\u2019t agree to abide by the outcome.\n\nMediation will not solve your problem.\n\nGo to court. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for.", "\u201cEntitled\u201d by what?", "By law each parent is entitled to 50/50 custody in the US. Is that so hard to understand? Whether or not they take it is a different story", "That\u2019s the part that\u2019s not legal advice. There is no such federal law in the us. It is a state issue."]}
