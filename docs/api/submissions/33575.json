This post is about my youngest son, Jack. Since they were children, I promised my kids two things, one, I\u2019ll fully pay for all of their college expenses (housing/tuition/food etc) and two, once they graduate college, I will buy them a car. I kept that promise for all my kids, except with Jack and now I want to know if I am an asshole for that. I paid for Jack\u2019s college expenses, but I am refusing to buy him a car, below is some of the reasons why:\n\n1. I co signed my name on the lease for Jack\u2019s room that he rents with a friend, and I send Jack his portion of the rent every month. The friend started taking advantage of my name being on the lease and stopped paying for rent too, knowing I will cover the amount because I don\u2019t want missed payments on my credit score. I asked Jack multiple times to ask his roommate to pay his portion, but the boy did not care to even respond to me and I ended up paying for six months of his friend\u2019s rent too until I finally solved the problem by getting my name out of the lease.\n2. Jack have a very rude and entitled attitude. He speaks to us like we are his low performing employees, the only time he contacts us is when he wants money and goes no contact otherwise, and we don\u2019t know what we ever did to him to treat us that way.\n3. Last year when my wife had to be hospitalized, all of my kids flew back home to be there for their mother. Jack didn\u2019t want to but one of his siblings bought him a ticket and talked him into flying out. Instead of being glad to be beside his very sick mother at the hospital, he spent the entire visit making everyone run errands for him (his sister has to cook a very specific type of meal for him/we had to drive him to the gym at a very specific time he demands etc) and acted like it was one huge inconvenience for him to have to fly out.\n\nI even talked to my other kids about  whether we were bad parents that caused Jack to act this way but all my other kids don\u2019t know why he ended up so entitled and spoilt. The rest of my kids are extremely different  from Jack, we all get along with each other and care about one another.  For the rest of my kids, I spent maybe $100K on each kid\u2019s total college expenses.  With Jack\u2019s  careless spending habits and unwillingness to save us any money, Jack\u2019s college years ended up costing me $180k. So I refused to buy the promised car. Jack\u2019s upset and has gone to his grandparents complaining about me. My MIL already hates me and now is calling me an asshole saying I am playing favourites because I bought everyone a car and not Jack.", "created_utc": 1703283670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oqjjy/aita_for_not_buying_my_son_a_car_like_i_did_for/", "score": 3730, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should he be? He bullied his way through or charmed through everything he wanted. Now everyone is surprised he wants to control the narrative. Tough live time folks and all hands on deck for a unified response to him about boundaries.\n\nThe rent thing kills me.

Would you have withheld the car in that scenario too?\n\n\nSo what it comes down to, is his crap attitude. Narcissistic attitude.
