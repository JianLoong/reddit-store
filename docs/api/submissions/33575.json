This post is about my youngest son, Jack. Since they were children, I promised my kids two things, one, I\u2019ll fully pay for all of their college expenses (housing/tuition/food etc) and two, once they graduate college, I will buy them a car. I kept that promise for all my kids, except with Jack and now I want to know if I am an asshole for that. I paid for Jack\u2019s college expenses, but I am refusing to buy him a car, below is some of the reasons why:\n\n1. I co signed my name on the lease for Jack\u2019s room that he rents with a friend, and I send Jack his portion of the rent every month. The friend started taking advantage of my name being on the lease and stopped paying for rent too, knowing I will cover the amount because I don\u2019t want missed payments on my credit score. I asked Jack multiple times to ask his roommate to pay his portion, but the boy did not care to even respond to me and I ended up paying for six months of his friend\u2019s rent too until I finally solved the problem by getting my name out of the lease.\n2. Jack have a very rude and entitled attitude. He speaks to us like we are his low performing employees, the only time he contacts us is when he wants money and goes no contact otherwise, and we don\u2019t know what we ever did to him to treat us that way.\n3. Last year when my wife had to be hospitalized, all of my kids flew back home to be there for their mother. Jack didn\u2019t want to but one of his siblings bought him a ticket and talked him into flying out. Instead of being glad to be beside his very sick mother at the hospital, he spent the entire visit making everyone run errands for him (his sister has to cook a very specific type of meal for him/we had to drive him to the gym at a very specific time he demands etc) and acted like it was one huge inconvenience for him to have to fly out.\n\nI even talked to my other kids about  whether we were bad parents that caused Jack to act this way but all my other kids don\u2019t know why he ended up so entitled and spoilt. The rest of my kids are extremely different  from Jack, we all get along with each other and care about one another.  For the rest of my kids, I spent maybe $100K on each kid\u2019s total college expenses.  With Jack\u2019s  careless spending habits and unwillingness to save us any money, Jack\u2019s college years ended up costing me $180k. So I refused to buy the promised car. Jack\u2019s upset and has gone to his grandparents complaining about me. My MIL already hates me and now is calling me an asshole saying I am playing favourites because I bought everyone a car and not Jack.", "created_utc": 1703283670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oqjjy/aita_for_not_buying_my_son_a_car_like_i_did_for/", "score": 1289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should he be? He bullied his way through or charmed through everything he wanted. Now everyone is surprised he wants to control the narrative. Tough live time folks and all hands on deck for a unified response to him about boundaries.\n\nThe rent thing kills me.

Would you have withheld the car in that scenario too?\n\n\nSo what it comes down to, is his crap attitude. Narcissistic attitude.

Ever since that instance I always stepped back and let my wife be the disciplinarian, but he's been bullying and taking advantage of my wife and we couldnt talk to him.\n\nHe bullied you, you responded by backing down and passing the buck. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to say it dude because I do feel for you, but that was the moment you fucked up.\n\nI have raised a teenage step son who has autism, ADHD and oppositional defiance disorder. I\u2019ve been threatened with physical violence and always responded calmly and explaining that he could hit me and I would not fight back but that the punishment would stand no matter what. \n\nOur relationship strengthened significantly once he realised exactly where the lines were and that I was serious about it. \n\nBacking off just put your wife in the firing line and taught him to be abusive to get what he wants.", ">\u201cHis sister had to cook a very specific type of meal for him.\u201d \u201cWe had to drive him to the gym at a very specific time he demands.\u201d\n\nYeah, really great points.  They didn't *have* to do any of these things.  But they cave in easily to demands, thus training the kid to be demanding.  None of us are perfect parents, so I can see that you might have done that when he's younger but... as an adult?  Why is everyone still caving in?  Why aren't they standing up to him now, and just ignoring his requests?\n\nAn adult would figure out how to get to the gym or just not go.  An adult would figure out how to eat when it's not the \"exact\" right meal made with someone else, or just not eat.", "Ikr? I was thinking, \u201cWhy is anyone cooking for him? Why does anyone HAVE to drive him to the gym?\u201d No wonder he is like he is. They\u2019re still treating him like a king.", "Exactly. My kids father is entitled. He's the oldest and him and his two sister are adopted. He cannot take hearing the word no. He will start getting mean and snappy, thinking you don't care about him. He's had anger outbursts in public yelling at a gas attendant (we live in New Jersey) and at someone who was at the front desk at a hotel, the hotel had roaches and he wanted a refund and the guy was talking about the process of it and he was impatient. Oh and he's really impatient. \n\nHis dad said he was a really nice boy when they adopted him, he does have mental health issues and was getting medicine for ADHD when younger but apparently it didn't work well for him. But I have a cousin who knew his sister's in school and told me that all 3 of them were spoiled. A.d I can honestly tell. I'm an only child and I'm no where near as spoiled as what I have seen. His parents thought that just giving in to him would stop him from getting worse so he would relax but it doesn't. He just finds more ways to take advantage of everyone and does own up to his mistakes the way he thinks he does. \n\nWhen I first met him he was not like this, he had just gotten out of rehab (which he holds resentment against his parents for because who send someone to rehab for weed, even though it was also for alcohol) and he was sober and he was doing good. I have been absolutely shocked since he stopped being sober at his behavior. Anyways. Telling your kids no and sticking to it, should definitely help to not cause entitled and applied behaviors as teens and adults.", "Do you mind me asking what you mean by \u201cgot what was coming\u201d? \n\nMy parents don\u2019t know what to do with my little brother\u2026I\u2019m trying to crowdsource ideas lol.", "So the question is, should they get him the car or not?", "If Jack were 5 I\u2019d agree with you, but he\u2019s now an adult and it\u2019s time for him to start being less selfish and more responsible.

That\u2019s not where you start.", "His mate didn't pay rent for 6 months until OP was able to get off the lease.  That's a massive sense of entitlement right there, from both of them.  Even if OP never said a word at the time (which I seriously doubt), the kid would have known he was massively taking advantage.  If OP pays for the car now, then there were no consequences for that.  That's wrong.  'No' needs to start now.", "That isn't how I read it.  If dad made a promise that he'd do it, and he followed through on the other three kids on that same promise, I think it's a bad thing to go back on one's word, and damaging to the relationship with his son (and his son's relationships with his siblings who were treated differently from him).  That doesn't mean dad doesn't do the parenting thing, and doesn't lay out future consequences if the relationship/behavior doesn't improve, but breaking one's word is the wrong way to go, and doesn't take away other options.  I'm in agreement the son sucks as well, but that's a different issue than not following through on a promise, and that's where dad should put his energy.", "I own a 2001 F150 and it is reliable and has everything I need.
