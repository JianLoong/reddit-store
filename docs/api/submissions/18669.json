I had been cruising along the totally flat section and was coming up to the (not steep, but fairly long) hill - so I wanted to keep as much momentum as possible. (I was not an especially strong biker, but as long as nothing broke it was cheaper than the subway.) There were two people standing way on one edge of the path chatting, which should have been fine except that one of them had a dog on an extendable leash and the dog was on the grass all the way on the other side, so the leash was blocking the entire shared bike/pedestrian path. The chatters clearly felt they were sufficiently out of the way (or just F everyone else I guess) and were not looking around them AT ALL. I slowed down a fair bit from my top speed (which, again, was not ALL that fast in the first place), hoping they would notice me, and then decided to just go around the dog on the grass instead of dealing with trying to make them get out of the way. As I pass them (off the path, a safe distance from the dog), the owner startles and then yells at me \"did you consider slowing down AT ALL?!?\"\n\nLike,\n\na) I did slow down, which you would know if you had been paying any attention because you would have seen me earlier and known what speed I was going before.\n\nb) I even considered slowing down more, but if I did that, I might have ended up having to walk up that hill, and then I'd be late to work.\n\nc) I am literally the only living being who has been inconvenienced by this situation, because I slowed down and then rode on the grass to keep myself and YOUR dog safe while you did exactly whatever TF you felt like, how are you mad at ME?\n\nand d) This is a public path, not your private yard.\n\nI still sort of wish I had gone back and explained all that to her, but see previous point about not making it up the hill and then being late to work.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. anyone who uses an extendable dog leash is though.", "ESH.

I hate retractable leashes & don't believe they have a single redeeming feature. At all. I will die on this hill. \n\nPitts have a low center of gravity, so making that even lower while still carrying a significant amount of body mass & muscle?  She needs a regular leash on a harness that clips in front of the chest.  I personally love Gentle Leaders, but I'm not sure how well they work in dogs with shorter snouts.", "Lol, I was just about to comment the same thing", "NTA - The dog is their responsibilty, not yours.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA Those extended leads are a menace - I see so many dog owners using them in inappropriate spaces.", "NTA\u2026 100% dog owners fault.. ridiculous entitlement", "NTA. I fly with my dog quite often. When we\u2019re in the terminal, she\u2019s in her kennel.", "I've seen this happen too", "When my husband and I were thinking about getting a dog, I first started volunteering to dogwalk for our local shelter, because I have been afraid of fogs since I was scratched in my eye when I was young.\n\nThis meant walking with 1 or 2 dogs at a time, different breeds... Could be shelter-dogs, could be pension-dogs (humans on vacation). I never walked the really big/strong dogs, due to my fear, but I did learn a lot, and now, 11 years after quitting, I am friends with most types of dog. I quit when we adopted our first dog in 2012.\n\nWalking all different types of dog did help me to learn their way of communicating. It was somewhat controlled, especially at first.", "I don't take my dogs with me basically anywhere aside from the dog park and daily walks. This isn't any kind of personal fight for me.\n\nIf *you* tripped over the leash and sustained an injury, again, a bigger reaction like OP's would be warranted. I'm saying that HIS reaction to HIS situation was incredibly over the top. There was no reason for him to yell and shout about it. He could've just said that the person should keep a closer eye on their dog, and moved on with his life.", "Oh don't worry hubbies dog is the drowny type too. He hates water and would drown you if you had him in the pool. My wolfhound cross kelpie on the other hand will stay out in the middle of the yard during a thunderstorm", "People who let their dogs essentially run loose (that's what a retractable leash does) in an airport aren't going to like being told to keep an eye on their precious Fido. \n\nAnd if someone sustains a serious injury because a dog owner doesn't take basic precautions, I hope the injured person sues them into bankruptcy and beyond", "If someone sustains a serious injury, I agree they should be told they're an asshole and probably sued. That didn't even come close to happening here; everyone else in the crowd saw the dog and leash in plenty of time to avoid it.\n\nAnd who cares how the person reacts? This is a 10 second interaction with a person OP will never see again. Why does it have to matter THIS much?\n\nAlso, thanks for explaining the concept of a retractable leash! I definitely needed that, what with its incredibly vague name and incredible rarity.", "NTA", "NTA. The man had a pet. He is responsible for that pet and the harm that that pet causes. You gotta be mindful, dog-dad. OP, you are totally NTA.", "NTA- self centered dog owner is breaking rules and being self centered.

Something happened in a two second span.", "Retractable leashes are never suitable for anything other than the trashcan", "I thought the comment I replied to mentioned a long leash being used. I think it's an important detail to note because it changes the context.", "The rest of us shouldn't have to deal with minor injuries because of selfish pricks like you", "Okay \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
