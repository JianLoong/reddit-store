There's a time and a place to let your dog roam and an airport is not that. Especially for a tiny dog. This said by an (actually responsible) dog owner.", "The swearing could have been over the top but i wanna say NTA\n\nWhile I can understand the dog owner being worried about his own dog when the leash was tripped on, I feel like the owner should have at least checked if you were okay \n\nFeel like his immediate response to say \u2018watch where you\u2019re going\u2019 triggered a higher anger response from you", "Irresponsible dog owner! Airports are crowded with people looking up mostly looking at flight information and gate locations. Poor pooch could have gotten hurt or even wrapped the leash around someone\u2019s feet. He\u2019s lucky the dog wasn\u2019t trampled on. Glad you weren\u2019t hurt.

They're incredibly dangerous if you're letting them go out for more than the 1-3 feet needed to reach the dog. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.", "I travel with pets in cabin often. Unless that's a real service dog (jacket), it should be in a carrier unless it's too large. Extendable leashes are never acceptable in an airport imo. Service dogs are never on an extendable. Next time, call airport security over. Even if the dog's flight is paid for, it's not allowed loose in the airport unless it's a *service dog*. Not an ESA. They would have been told to put the dog in it's carrier or been escorted out of the airport. NTA", "NTA. Retractable leashes are 100% asshole items and not needed in public, especially an airport.", "NTA. You could have gotten hurt or hurt someone else by tripping on them. I would expect someone with a dog in such a crowded place to keep it closer to them and take responsibility if something happens. Also, with how airports are so stressful sometimes,  it's understandable that you were more angry, i think, than if it happened in the street or a less crowded and stressful environment.", "NTA, should have cut the cord and let Fido run free. Missing their flight trying to catch the dog might make them think next time.", "ESH. Dog owner shouldn\u2019t be creating a tripping hazard. OP overreacted - even his buddy thought so. And both of them are A Hs for getting into an aggressive shouting match in public, while other people were just trying to go about their days.", "ESH. extendable leashes are awful for many reasons and especially in an airport with lots of people walking around they shouldn\u2019t have had their dog on one, let alone that far away from them. they\u2019re being irresponsible towards the dog and everyone around them. that said, i also think you overreacted and needlessly escalated the situation.", "ESH-but him more than you. He shouldn't have a dog on an extendable leash at the airport and he shouldn't have said a triggering thing of...watch where you're going. A decent person would have at least asked if you are ok.", "ESH he shouldn't have had the dog on the leash that far, you overreacted by a lot", "YTA  for making a non issue an issue.
