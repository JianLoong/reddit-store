Unless that's a real service dog (jacket), it should be in a carrier unless it's too large. Extendable leashes are never acceptable in an airport imo. Service dogs are never on an extendable.

I would expect someone with a dog in such a crowded place to keep it closer to them and take responsibility if something happens. Also, with how airports are so stressful sometimes,  it's understandable that you were more angry, i think, than if it happened in the street or a less crowded and stressful environment.", "NTA, should have cut the cord and let Fido run free.
