Unless that's a real service dog (jacket), it should be in a carrier unless it's too large. Extendable leashes are never acceptable in an airport imo. Service dogs are never on an extendable.

I would expect someone with a dog in such a crowded place to keep it closer to them and take responsibility if something happens. Also, with how airports are so stressful sometimes,  it's understandable that you were more angry, i think, than if it happened in the street or a less crowded and stressful environment.", "NTA, should have cut the cord and let Fido run free.

Or one of those luggage/disabled tram thingys?

I have had dogs range in size from Pomeranian to Wolfhound cross (his not full wolfhound so he only comes up to my hip but can put his paws on my shoulders) and when we are out in public (not at a dog park) they are trained to stay by my side. Even hubby's kelpie, who I didn't train, so isn't as well behaved on the leash won't wander too far because hubby shortens the leash when there are other people around.\n\nNTA OP, luckily that AH you encountered doesn't represent all dog owners but unfortunately there are more like him out there.
