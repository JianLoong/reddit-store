{"id": 27558, "submission_id": "16rb5mt", "title": "AITA for insinuating a woman was fat?", "selftext": "I (35F) am currently 8 months pregnant. Something I've learned (fun news for anyone aspiring to follow down that same path) is that a LOT of people, mostly older women, feel that if you get pregnant they suddenly have the right to both comment and touch your body without permission. Sometimes/often without warning- even total strangers. I'm an intrinsically private person and while I don't take offense, it does encourage the inner snark to come out. \n\nI started showing around 5/6 months. I have two fibroids that are each quite large, think softball size. This causes me to look bigger and further along than I am. I've also not really gained elsewise (yes I'm aware it's a good problem to have, but I do look disproportionate) so it's REALLY apparent even under hoodies. Fast forward to last weekend.\n\nI was in our local grocery store and an older, larger woman walks up to me and says something akin to \"aw hunny, congrats! How far along are you?\". Kindly, sure, so I smile, step out of touching distance (this is usually when they go for a belly feel) and say \"8 months\". She looked at me with a shocked expression and exclaims \"Oh hun NO I would have guessed any day now! YOU'RE HUGE!!\"\n\nSo... I smiled sweetly back at her and said \"aw thanks, you too\". \n\nYou can imagine it didn't go over well. At one point she said something about it being medical, and so my one interjection was \"hey me too\"- but it didn't do much to diffuse the situation. Eventually she huffed away and I carried on my business.\n\nI don't really feel bad, but I am trying to gauge the assholiness of my response. I strongly feel that there shouldn't be a stigma that pregnant women suddenly become public property, but acknowledge I could have once again been the 'bigger person'. Or responded with \"yeah I have two tumors in there with her\" which has historically gotten a sputtering apology from people too. (Fibroids are benign tumors so this is technically true, just aimed at making people uncomfortable).", "created_utc": 1695595268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rb5mt/aita_for_insinuating_a_woman_was_fat/", "score": 4257, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something I've learned (fun news for anyone aspiring to follow down that same path) is that a LOT of people, mostly older women, feel that if you get pregnant they suddenly have the right to both comment and touch your body without permission. Sometimes/often without warning- even total strangers. I'm an intrinsically private person and while I don't take offense, it does encourage the inner snark to come out. \n\nI started showing around 5/6 months. I have two fibroids that are each quite large, think softball size. This causes me to look bigger and further along than I am. I've also not really gained elsewise (yes I'm aware it's a good problem to have, but I do look disproportionate) so it's REALLY apparent even under hoodies. Fast forward to last weekend.\n\nI was in our local grocery store and an older, larger woman walks up to me and says something akin to \"aw hunny, congrats! How far along are you?\". Kindly, sure, so I smile, step out of touching distance (this is usually when they go for a belly feel) and say \"8 months\". She looked at me with a shocked expression and exclaims \"Oh hun NO I would have guessed any day now! YOU'RE HUGE!!\"\n\nSo... I smiled sweetly back at her and said \"aw thanks, you too\". \n\nYou can imagine it didn't go over well. At one point she said something about it being medical, and so my one interjection was \"hey me too\"- but it didn't do much to diffuse the situation. Eventually she huffed away and I carried on my business.\n\nI don't really feel bad, but I am trying to gauge the assholiness of my response. I strongly feel that there shouldn't be a stigma that pregnant women suddenly become public property, but acknowledge I could have once again been the 'bigger person'. Or responded with \"yeah I have two tumors in there with her\" which has historically gotten a sputtering apology from people too. (Fibroids are benign tumors so this is technically true, just aimed at making people uncomfortable).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Intent is only half of the interaction. Equally important is how one's words are *received*.\n\nI'm only as wise as the things I'm exposed to in my life. But someone with a different background and life experience has their own wisdom, their own sensitivities that I may be ignorant of. It would be wrong for me to unintentionally offend someone and discount their feelings in response. Even if I didn't intend to hurt them, once they express the impact my words had, the respectful thing to do is validate their feelings, learn from the experience and what they are teaching about their perspective, and do better in the future. That's kind of how we get better as human beings, how society changes, language changes, terms or phrases go out of style. Like, have you ever Googled *idioms we should stop using*? There are some really awful origins for some. We can all do better.\n\nThat said....I actually 100% agree with you. *'I just said her rudeness was inappropriate.

Besides which, you don\u2019t know the person in front you, maybe you\u2019re talking to a pregnant woman in recovery from and eating disorder. Commenting on pregnant women\u2019s bodies is not acceptable just because you think there\u2019s less stigma. A) there is stigma, and B) the person is still affected", "No, you\u2019re crazy for thinking someone who acknowledges the fact that you\u2019re pregnant is somehow insulting or judging your body.", "Thank you, I have horrible pregnancy brain so I can't completely form coherent sentences right now but I felt crazy.", "I figured the brushing thing might be common, but man, all of the random \"that means it's a boy/girl\" makes me laugh.\n\nWhen my mother was pregnant back in prehistoric times, she didn't trust that an ultrasound was safe and wouldn't let them do one, so they just checked on me the other ways, measuring her stomach and using a stethoscope and leeches, I don't know what it was.

Plus even nicely saying you look huge while pregnant can come off as rude, again best to leave comments to yourself. I guess I don't like talking to strangers, you say something people are allowed to comment nice or rudely back, they don't know you or owe you anything.

If the asshole OP wrote \"she said I looked huge so I fucking killed her and shot her in the head and murdered her\" these maniac dumbfucks would be piling over each other to tell her what a NTA hero she was. Reddit is a great place to get advice but you have to sift through the mountains of shitty advice givers.\n\nOP is an asshole. \"You're huge\" is a pretty mild thing to say to a pregnant woman. You'd need very thin patience to think it's rude.", "I agree, though I'd say that ESH.  There's a reason why it's no longer \"appropriate\" to comment on woman's pregnancy anymore: Americans today live in a society confronted with an overweight and obesity epidemic, alongside additional health problems they might have. This wasn't the case 40ish+ years ago, so it's now harder to tell plus-size pregnant ladies apart from heavy-set women.  People also weren't as thin-skinned or insecure as they are today.  That said, it still wasn't nice of OP to reply with an insensitive retort, especially towards a jolly woman from an older generation, who was merely making friendly small-talk showing genuine interest for what's supposed to be a happy life event.", "I\u2019m sorry but what does ESH stand for? \ud83d\ude2d", "Being pregnant doesn't give you a right to be a dick.

That's the difference.", "So let me get this straight - in order to make a point about how horrible it is to comment on a pregnant person\u2019s body, one should turn right around and clap back with a comment about a non-pregnant person\u2019s body? Is it just the privilege of pregnant people to want their bodies respected and not commented upon? People who are not pregnant are fair game and have no right to expect the same? Just say you think bigger bodies are deserving of ridicule, with only pregnant people being exceptions, and move on.", "Exactly. It's quite obvious this woman meant well from all the other niceties she gave OP.
