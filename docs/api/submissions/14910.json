He tried to hold you hostage by telling you about the booking after you were already in his car and then proceeding to the motel without actually asking if you wanted to go.

You were too high to articulate it well but you made it known and got yourself out of the situation. \n\nTwice he\u2019s booked a motel without discussing it with you first. And \u00a350?? Idk but where I\u2019m from that doesn\u2019t buy a very clean or nice room. He was hoping for a bang. \n\nThirdly... 35 and still living with his parents.

If you weren't comfortable, then that is the way it is.", "A nice guy that you just started dating would never book a hotel room without running it by you first. \n\nA decent guy would book without consulting you but as soon as you expressed discomfort with it (like you did at the beginning of the night) would say no pressure and bring you home no questions asked before the end of the night \n\nA guy with questionable motives would book the room, hear that you\u2019re uncomfortable and still bring you back to the hotel later in the night. And then upon wanting to leave and not be in the car with him because of him being under the influence would not offer cab money. \n\nSometimes when our gut tells us something is wrong it\u2019s because it is. You made the right decision leaving and I wouldn\u2019t recommend going out with him again.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong leaving. Thems the breaks when you share the devil's lettuce with people- sometimes they nope out. I'm glad you did.", "NTA - He booked the room without asking you, got you high & pressured you to go.\n\nHR keeps trying to trap you in a room, so you know he's not gonna let you walk once he jumps on you.\n\nTime to dump this guy before you wake up pregnant.", "NTA, you have every right to call it an early night and back out of even the nicest date in the world if you want to.\n\nThis guy went ahead with things you said you weren't comfortable with and responded to your concern by getting you high. That's not you leading him on, that's him being a creep.", "NTA!! That so unacceptable of him and you listened to your needs and intuition and got out of there. He was disrespectful and trying to manipulate you into a situation where it would be impossible to say no and maybe even result in SA.  I'm proud of you. Never let a guy take you where you don't want to go. You didn't lead him on. You were dating. You don't owe anyone sex. Ever. But if it's off the table for you completely, dating is going to be a challenge. There are asexual dating sites where people date for companionship", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is always your right no matter what. Why is he booking motels without even talking to you before hand? That\u2019s pretty presumptuous. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t even go to a motel that was pre-booked without my input. Everyone has a different timeline of when they are ready to take the next step. You don\u2019t mention how long you\u2019ve been dating, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you guys have had a conversation about this. If you are interested in more have a conversation with him about it. That way you guys are on the same page.", "NTA. You were uncomfortable with the situation.", "Nta he shouldn\u2019t drive high", "NTA - you made it clear that you did not want to spend the night in a motel with him.  He booked a room anyways and tried to coerce you into staying with him. That\u2019s super disrespectful and creepy.

You are dating a guy and have issues with intimacy and have not ACTUALLY COMMUNICATED that information to him. \n\nYou obsess internally but don't actually COMMUNICATE.\n\nYou're not an asshole, but you shouldn't be dating anyone.", "No not at all. Sounds like you definitely need to have a talk about what you want out of the relationship. He sounds like he has no clue about how you feel about things, or what you are going through. If you have talked to him about those things then he isn\u2019t a good guy. Definitely sounds like he either wants a traditional boyfriend and girlfriend physical relationship, or he is just looking for sex.", "NTA he was pushy, pushing you into something you didn\u2019t want.
