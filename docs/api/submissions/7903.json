You were the only one who wanted to go to that restaurant. You acted like an AH overruling not only your kids but your wife as well. \n2. Bad things can still happen in safe areas.

You don\u2019t leave 7 and 9 year old children unattended in a car, and you sure as hell don\u2019t override everyone else\u2019s wishes, especially your wife\u2019s. I can tell by the fact that she didn\u2019t feel powerful enough to tell you no about the restaurant and, even more so, to stand up to you about leaving her babies unattended that you\u2019re abusing her and she is afraid of you: I\u2019m sure the kids are too. I hope she finds the strength to leave you and take her babies with her. You\u2019re a monster.", "YTA. And I think one of the lessons here is don\u2019t make threats if you can\u2019t stand over them. Susie was right to call your bluff. Even the 7yr old knows that you can\u2019t leave kids in a car like this. But you had backed your self into a corner. Next time, be reasonable. No dessert would have been an adequate threat. \n\nAlso, but selfish too. Your wife and two kids chose the other restaurant!", "Nah man come on they're too little for this! It takes like 3 seconds for someone to smash open the window and grab them up. Or they can probably unlock the doors by now and run off.

As for the \"putting them in danger\" comments, most of us parents, if not all, always keep an eye on the kid", "Oh coome on the wife only gave in so she didnt have to deal with the tantrums anymore...\nKids gotta learn too, plans are set and whining about them doesnt mean you get your way\n\nThese kids sounds entitled AF", "\"since both parents were negligent you get a pass!\"\n\nYou're an asshole too!\n\nSince when is leaving a 7 and a 9 year old in a car, so you can have dinner uninterrupted, acceptable?", "Pretty sure the most important thing in parenting is looking out for your child's safety and well-being, not following through with threats. OP doesn't get a \"pass\" just because wife was complicit; they're just both bad parents.", "Doesn\u2019t justify leaving kids in a car alone", "Not only hijacking. Imagine some idiot driving into their parked car when the kids were in it. And I agree, the 7 year old seems to have a better grip on parenting and what's responsible and what is not than OP.", "I agree with you, but I fear we\u2019re in the minority here. Kids were being brats, wife caved due to bratty kids, OP made a judgment call. NTA, although it would have been better to threaten to just take the kids home and follow through with that.", "You are mistaking gentle parenting with permissive parenting.", "Tell this to a cop. That OP and his wife were \"justified\" in leaving literal kids in a car alone, see how far that gets you", "In psychology there are 3 parenting styles. Authoritarian (see OP), permissive (kids do what they want) & authoritative (which people are now calling \u201cgentle\u201d). \n\nGuess which style results in the best overall outcomes?", "That's not gentle parenting  lmfao", "Driving home would have the same effect of leaving them in the car and teaching them a lesson of \"if we can't decide and compramise, then lets not go anywhere\" and wouldnt be caving into what the children wanted. The difference is that they would be supervised and would have a decent meal with actual vitamins and nutrients, rather than ceral. \n\nHowever, the main issue here is that 3 out of 4 people (one of them being the wife/mum) wanted to go to the same place and instead of teaching the children that compromising is important, they're being taught that they can't argue with their dad. Ever. \n\nMaybe if it was OPs birthday or special occasion, he would've had the final say. But he doesn't. \n\nYTA", "People crash into parked cars all the time", "Accidents happen when you least expect it, always better to be safe than sorry.", "I bet OP wouldn't have accepted an ounce of blame if his kids were taken after he left them alone in the car to prove his point. It would have been his kids' fault for challenging his authority.", "The common sense aspect was not leaving children alone in a car.", "lol it's so funny to me when people talk about kids having gratitude. Kids don't express appreciation the same way adults do. They're 7 and 9. Shut up.", "They're being forced to go somewhere to eat where they don't like the food. Also, they're SEVEN AND NINE. Their behavior at least makes sense.", "You can just ignore a tantrum and go ahead with your initial plans without needing to resort to an ultimatum. OP just wanted to shout louder than them.", "Ah yes, so that you can watch through the restaurant window as they get hit by a car or snatched by a stranger. Totally responsible parenting.", "> *\"Oh coome on the wife only gave in so she didnt have to deal with the tantrums anymore\"*\n\nYou mean the part where she reluctantly went along with OP so she wouldn't have to deal with ***his*** tantrum?\n\n> *\"plans are set and whining about them doesnt mean you get your way\"*\n\nWhy does OP get to set the plan unilaterally with no input from the rest of the family, including his *wife?*", "That is an assumption from the OP and you. I don't see his wife saying she caved in. He wanted his dictator seat. He didn't ask his wife if she wanted to go there. For all we know she waited for an opportunity to say she didn't want to go. She may just have fear of him because had I been in her shoes, I would have spoken up in the car and say he was out voted.", "Exactly. It would justify one parent staying with the kids and the other getting takeout just for them, going home and feeding the kids leftovers.", "I dont see how that is a bad thing if they are that old and i a safe town.", "Or a 7 or 9 year old putting the car into neutral and it coasts into something or someone.", "I know. This age in general is the age of gentle parenting. \\*eye roll\\* He is not subscribing, which pisses people off.", "What % of parked cars do you think get hit on a given day?", "By that logic they shouldnt have even gotten in the car to begin with? Also has risk of an accident, a higher one probably", "Yeah\u2026 basically", "OP assesed the situation as safe to leave them, maybe they had eyes on the car, or there was a valet ir who knows.\nDo you know more about this specific situation than OP? Guess no so why do you think you are more capable to make an asessment than he is?", "So that means they should just get their way anytime they throw a tantrum? They're young, not dumb.. they pick up on these things", "And of course children aaaalways like the food at home and are neeever forced to eat that?! \nYou see the Irony there don't you?\n\nSure 7 and 9, but the 7yo sure as hell thought she was big enough to argue? They were given the choice to eat there or stay in the car.. they made their choice all while challenging dad to bluff..\nHow do you think OPs parenting wouldve gone over if he gave in?\nOP states he assesed the situation as safe enough to leave them, unless you know more about this excact situation who are you to say you know better than him?", ">You mean the part where she reluctantly went along with OP so she wouldn't have to deal with his tantrum?\n\nI mean idk if you can read but it literally says that the wife gave in to appease the kids..?\n\n>Why does OP get to set the plan unilaterally with no input from the rest of the family, including his wife?\n\nWhere does it say that OP made the plan himself? It says the family had a reservation.. not OP had a reservation", ">He wanted his dictator seat\n\n>She may just have fear of him\n\nSpeaking of assumptions\ud83d\ude05\n\nI am judging what is said in the post, like we are supposed to on this sub, and this was said in the post. Voila.\nEvery story has 2 sides, but we will never know will we? So we judge what is there and dont put our own made up fantasies in there", "\"safe town\" means fuck all. Those kids could get snatched in a second. Or they could unlock the doors and run out.\n\nIn some places, this shit is against the law.", "I mean, it's illegal in many states in the US. And even \"safe\" towns have crime.", "so 9 and 7 are old enough for you? do me a favour just dont ever have kids with that mindset brody.", "You know horrible things happen in safe towns right ? Kids are kidnapped in safe towns.", "Because I am a parent who knows it's never safe to leave a child unattended. Idc who you think you are it's  never ok to leave a child unattended.", "Because it's never safe to leave your kid alone in the car. He assessed WRONG. Again, in the US, there are legal minimum ages to leave kids alone. And in much of the country, this was a crime."]}
