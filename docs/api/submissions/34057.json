{"id": 34057, "submission_id": "18umqac", "title": "AITA for accidentally getting my 75yo mother arrested?", "selftext": "A couple of years ago, I had enough of my mom's crazy behavior and decided to cut her off. Notably, she's a former drunk turned functional pill addict. Somehow along the way, she and my now deceased father managed to adopt my mixed-race younger siblings, as she claims, 'just to spite her racist dad.' Unfortunately, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I'd even argue she's worse than my granddad.\n\nI swear she only relocated us to a politically divided town simply to hurt my siblings and expected me to follow in her footsteps. Big no from me! Instead, I stayed out of politics\u2014not because I don't care, but for my own sanity.\n\nAnyway, after getting married, educating myself to feel comfortable enough to vote and finally settling into a more permanent address, I was eager to register and do things my way. But while sifting through a ton of government paperwork, I discovered that \"I\" supposedly voted in the last three elections. Confused, I reached out to the proper agencies. Turns out, I had indeed registered when I was 18 but forgotten I chose mail-in ballots. I explained I understood, but there was no way I could have filled them out, as I was either at college or not living in that state during the elections.\n\nThey then asked who lived in the address where the ballots originated, and I said my mom and underage siblings. We hung up, and I thought, \"Alright, moving on.\" Fast forward, and I get a call requesting more information. I provide it and moved on once again.\n\nWelp, a few days ago, I received a video of my 75-year-old mom getting arrested. I initially thought it was just another one of her 'Karen' moments, but nope! She'd been fraudulently mailing in my votes.\n\nPersonally, I'm just vibing with the idea that karma finally got its way! However, a friends mentioned I shouldn't let an elderly woman, especially my mother, face criminal charges.", "created_utc": 1703962546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18umqac/aita_for_accidentally_getting_my_75yo_mother/", "score": 863, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
