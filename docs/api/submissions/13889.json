One day, my mother called and told me not to call/message V about her husband dying. \"She had been getting calls all week, and she just wants everybody to leave her alone.\"\n\nI checked V's Facebook, and she'd written a couple posts like, \"Everybody stop calling/messaging me.\" She also had a post saying to contact the husband's family to arrange a visit. So, I didn't bother her. I'd only met her husband/husband's family like once, but I arranged to visit at the hospital through the family to show support. \n\nApparently, this made V angry. Our mother (who V calls and complains to all the time), told me she was angry I contacted his family but not her. She didn't want me to come, so I didn't. They had a funeral in secret, so I obviously didn't go to that. I still didn't call her, because it seemed clear she didn't want me involved, and wanted his death to be a secret. \n\nV asked me to visit her last year (the first time we've talked in like 10 years). While I was there, she complained about, \"people who didn't even call when her husband died. And how they were assholes.\" I'm pretty sure that was her passive aggressive way of complaining about me. The whole family coddles her over the smallest things. I find it hard to believe they'd ignore her over her husband dying. I just said, \"That's unfortunate. Sorry if you didn't feel you had the support you needed,\" to avoid a fight. \n\nAnyways, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680517901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ag4y9/aita_for_not_calling_my_sister_when_her_husband/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were respecting HER wishes at the time, idk why she\u2019s pissy at you. You handled it well too. No sense in stirring up an argument over it now that it\u2019s over with and you know she\u2019s just being petty.", "Going just off what you wrote, you seem to have followed all the instructions she posted on her socials in response to her loss. NTA\n\nBut seriously, wtf is this? Why are you concerned with V's good opinion when you didn't talk to her for 10 years, then interacted once on a visit last year. She sounds exhausting. Go back to not contacting her for the next 10 years or so... you had the right idea.", "NTA - you were told directly by mom not to call. Unless mom is evil, this would not be done unless bereaved daughter made it clear she didn't want to hear from her sister. This should have been resolved last year when she was angry you went through the husband's family to arrange a visit. If you explained that you wanted to visit but believed she wouldn't want a call from you for the reasons listed, I don't think she's got a choice but to let go of the anger and forgive you. The fact she got angry at you for \"not being supportive\" I assume, and then didn't invite you to the funeral tells me that she's just lashing out at you. \n\nIn my country, even your primary school's teacher's best friend would be told about your sister's husband's funeral (funerals are a big deal!) so \"secret funerals\" are an alien concept to me. If she wants to hide his death from the world, she can't expect people to be there for her.", "NTA\nYou read the cues not to contact her such as the Facebook message.\n\nA card may have been a better thing that you could have done.\n\nBut no, I think you handled this well", "NTA First your sister says not to call her then she's angry when no one called her. She can't have it both ways.", "NTA, your sister seems like she wants the attention no means yes and yes means yes? She is confusing, and I would go back to no contact to be honest.", "NTA, time to go back to not seeing her for 10 years. Sounds less stressful", "nta- obviously you weren't in touch with her for a reason, i think i know why.  we can't chose our family.  you did what you were supposed to do, no reason to carry this cross too.", "YTA not for the lack of phone calls--because that seems fair enough as a way to respect her wishes--but for the lack of empathy you're showing when recounting the situation. \"The whole family coddles her over the smallest things.\" Her husband dying is not a small thing. If she's upset that you didn't call her, it would be easy to apologise and explain that you were trying to honour her request for no phone calls. She's hurting right now and wants to know if you care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't really care what people think of me as a person, but I do care if my actions are harmful. \n\nIm bringing it up now, because my half-brother's mother is now sick, and I'm also nc with my brother. I want nothing to do with my bio family, but also feel like maybe it's the right thing to give him a call when she passes? I'm sure the conflict will be brought up when I go to the funeral, so I kind of want to avoid the funeral, eventhough I was close to her. \n\nThis particular conflict has been somewhat confusing for me, but I feel gaining perspective on the first issue may give me guidance on the new one. Thank you for your input.", "Well, I sent cookies for her and her daughters. But I did so anonymously, so she wouldn't be upset by me knowing her husband passed if it was supposed to be a secret.", "No. I wouldn't have just not called if mother was the only one to say it. I didn't call, because her own post history instructed not to call her. But mother telling me that is what prompted me to check in the first place. \n\nNot to mention, I know she knows. And I was stuck at V's house for the weekend that she brought it up last year. There's nothing I could have said to satisfy her. It would have just turned into a huge fight. I would have been stuck at her place with a passive aggressive sister, or she would have kicked me out in a strange country with no place to go (which i think may have been preferrable of the two).", "Oh! I have a very similar brother. \n\nIt will be the right thing to call him. The call will also be awkward and the funeral will be uncomfortable, but if you were close to the deceased, you can handle a little discomfort. Once it's done, you can go back to happily ignoring each other. \n\nUnless he posts on his socials asking people not to call him and giving instructions on how to get details from other people. In which case, you can happily ignore each other and you can do what you have to do, he can live his life, and the world can keep right on spinning.", "Honestly OP\nYou're fine.\nYou did what all the cues were telling you to do.\n\nPlease don't stress :)", "I mean it sounds like you guys have some deeper longer term issues, and the \u201cstop calling me\u201d was more of a cry for help than anything.

That way, you respect his privacy while acknowledging his loss.

Leave her alone.   So you did.  NTA.  People say they don't want contact & then get mad when they get no contact.  Are you supposed to read her mind?  You handled it well.", "Why bother dealing with her? You never see her, so why bother placating or seeing her anymore. I would have called her on her shit.", "Thanks for the input. I'd like to clarify something that seems to be throwing some people off, understandably:\n\n>I find it perplexing why you would assume your sister's blanket facebook post should include you as her sibling.\n\nWe are only related by blood. We never really spoke, eventhough we lived in the same house when I was a kid. I know I wouldnt want them to bother me while I'm grieving.  Even if we had been close, consent is very important to me. I'd rather respect the boundary, unless an exception is made clear.", "Or send flowers with a note as a gesture", "NAH- because she is grieving and that can really throw you, what you think you need ends up being not what you really want. It's confusing and you did what you thought was best. And given your lack of contact it makes sense that she wouldn't know how to reach out and ask for support from you. \nYou did your best and are not at fault, but give your sister a pass for now ..", "This is bizarre. All of it. Either you have some major issues with navigating social situations or cues or they are unreasonable and weird or both. The cookies should have had your name on them so she and her kids knew you offered some type of support. Not calling is fine. But not sending a card, letter, anything to acknowledge the loss? That would hurt me even if I were estranged from that sibling/aunt. I'm honestly surprised she ever reached out again.", "NTA but you should have pointed out what she posted about not contacting her!", "Maybe a bit of both. She didn't \"reach out.\" She needed a favor, wanted to harass me (about an abortion she thought I'd had), and ambush me with a the family once she had me trapped in a different country. I try to avoid all communication with the family."]}
