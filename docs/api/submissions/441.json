The reasons for them to think you might not be able to go with them are for you to sort out, not for them to use to exclude you. The loving thing for them to do (assuming they aren't in a position to help you financially, at least a little, so that you could join them) would have been to invite you and to tell you to not feel pressured into joining if it'll mess up your finances or medical treatment, and that they'd be happy to spend time with you once they're back and maybe do a dinner or something or cut a lousy cake to celebrate with you.", "NTA - it sounds like your sister is the favourite child", "NTA. If they wanted to include you, they could have, but they chose not to.", "NTA. How you feel is perfectly understandable. Your only family saying they just assumed you were too poor and sick to go on vacation without even bothering to ask was really hurtful. Their stated reason for excluding you may be true. I don\u2019t know. And neither do you, which is the problem. You\u2019re in the right for starting a conversation about this. It\u2019s all in the delivery of course. As long as you address it in a mature way you\u2019re in the right.", "NTA.\n\nUhhhh,  are you me? This literally happened to me a few years back. Whole family went away from Christmas, no invite and when I asked why they said \"we knew you couldn't afford it.\" Like thanks, I felt bad but now I feel worse. I wish I had told my family how unwanted and unloved I felt, but I just cut them out of my life after they came to visit after they got back and we ended up watching rollercoaster videos for half an hour because we had nothing to say to each other. Sometimes you gotta think, \"would I spend time with these people if we weren't related?\". I feel for you OP.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I think I offended my grandma by saying she doesn't love me \" .. calling out an AH and pointing out the truth is never wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHAve you considered goning no contact with these AHs, and making some nice friends your new family instead?", "info: are you still using heroin?", "NTA But can't you just buy your own ticket if you care so much", "nta. its natural to feel like no one loves you when they dont even invite you to an important event i dont think they did it with malicious intent but it still hurts when you feel like you arent invited especially during christmas. your family on the other hand are the ah here. even if they thought you couldnt go due to financial issues, or health reasons they should have at least offered you the chance to go. if you said no after then they wouldnt feel bad.", "NTA.

Even if you couldn\u2019t afford to go, the invite is nice to have.", "NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry this happened, but at mid thirties, you\u2019re way too old to keep chasing after this family that clearly doesn\u2019t care about you or want you around (judging from the post and your comments). You\u2019re an adult! You don\u2019t have to wait for \u201cfamily\u201d to plan an international trip to travel internationally - you can plan a trip yourself, with friends or partner or just you! Yeah they suck for stamping on you like this - but stop putting yourself under their boots!", "I think that it's time you look elsewhere for a support system. Make some close friends and build a new family as it were.  You teach people how to treat you. Your family of origin constantly disrespect you.", "NTA... Tell said family you hope they have fun without you and to get use to it and then go no contact with them for awhile. I know its petty but sometimes people need a taste of how they make others feel.", "When I was in high school my best friends, two girls that couldn't stand each other the year before, decided to go to a Garth Brooks concert but only mentioned it to me as a casual \"oh, hey, guess what we're doing?!\" I was told that they didn't bother asking me to go because they knew my mom wouldn't let me go.........umm...okay.\n\nI know family doing it makes it far worse but I know how you feel.... you are NTA at all.", "NTA. A family even pretending to be loving would say \"we are doing a trip at Christmas. We are going overseas. I know money is a problem for you and you have all these health issues. It will cost $X and be between these dates. It would be *perfectly fine* if you didn't come\". And let you either figure it out or bow out.\n\nInstead they made the decision for you without asking, lied to you about it (by omission, but still lying), and then got upset when you pointed out how cruel they were.\n\nIf you have the ability, why don't you do a solo holiday? Treat yourself. Go sit by a pool somewhere eating ice cream and drinking cocktails, or see an old city, or go to an event. Flights on Christmas day tend to be very cheap (and will take your mind off not being with \"family\" on the day) so a round trip should even out in cost even if you are travelling during the holidays. Come home with a new experience, lots of photos, and memories you will never forget of that time you went on your own Christmas adventure!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Well I NEED routine!  Then the day after that my cousin just pulled out the TV and put it on and no one said a word to her! \nThankfully my cousin actually asked if I wanted to watch anything so I got to watch part of that days episode....then my sister came in started making loads of noise and chucked a dog toy in front of the TV, I obviously got annoyed and she started a big argument & I was like 'please just drop it' and she went 'no if I drop it you'll think you can get away with it again!'
