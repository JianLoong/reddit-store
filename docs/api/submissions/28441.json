Not only that, but she couldn\u2019t even talk to her mom on her own birthday had she not shown up. Your brother gets to be pissed but his anger is dangerously misdirected.

Ask her what she's feeling and offer to be her advocate rather than doing what you think is best. Just a thought.", "NTA or ESH.\n\nObviously Marie is for cheating and she broke the one happy family, but Joe like you said is going to have his daughter resent him a lot. Ava is still young and needs her mother in her life. This post isn't about Marie cheating it's about Joe's treatment of Marie that is effecting Ava.\n\nAva needs therapy and so does Joe a lot. It's been half a decade and he shouldn't still be feeling this kind of resentment towards his daughter's mother half a decade later. \n\nHe'll realize it too late what kind of hurt and mental distress he is causing Ava. He is only focused on hurting Marie and not about how he is hurting Ava.\n\nEdit: You mentioned how Ava is afraid to even mention her Mother to her dad which isn't okay. No child should be afraid to mention their parent to the other. He needs therapy and shouldn't be taking it out on Ava.", "NTA, my mom is Joe in this story, and I hate her for it.  There is no co-parenting happening because of Joe. This was not helpful for me from my mom growing up, and it's not helpful for Ava from her dad. Gender is irrelevant, Joe and Marie decided to have a kid, and both want to be in her life. If that's the case, it's the parents' job to buck up and co-parent professionally, not avoid it. Co-parenting doesn't mean you have to get along with the other parent. It means being there for your kid. My mom left my wedding early because she just couldn't handle it, and I honestly still resent her for it.\n\nAva shouldn't be punished because of her parents' choices.", "You are NTA for being concerned about how this animosity is affecting your niece.  It's so sad when adults allow their issues to bleed over to the children who are ill equipped to deal with these issues.  \n\nThat said, Marie knows Joe does not want her around and she really should not have crashed the birthday party that he was a part of.  She should have had her own separate celebration instead.  She knew her presence would not be well received by him, and she should have thought not to visit this upon her daughter at her birthday party.  I hate it when parents can't stuff it when they need to for the wellbeing of their children.\n\nChildren need to be allowed to love both parents, even when those parents are not perfect and have problems with each other.  You are right that your niece will likely, in time, resent what she is being subjected to right now and certainly denying her acknowledging her mother in her father's presence is damaging.  I get where your brother didn't appreciate your comments as he is too consumed with his anger at his ex-wife, but you are likely right here.", "NTA. I appreciate you sticking up for Ava. I'm divorced and my ex tries to alienate me from our child. Sadly, his family is fully on his side (mine is on my side), and the only person who loses is our child. What is his reasoning for wanting 100% custody? Just financial? That seems extremely vindictive and not at all fair to Ava who probably needs her mom as she navigates the teen years. Your brother needs to grow up.", "He is not an asshole. He just doesn't want his daughter to be a lazy whole like her mother", "NTA, ask your brother when he's gonna start loving his daughter more than he hates his ex, because until then he's a miserable excuse for a father.", "NTA\n\nShe'll grow up and understand her father is selfish and put his hurt feelings over her well-being.", "NTA\n\nKids always come first, no matter what. If the ex was a bad parent, different story, but from what you've said she isn't. \n\nYour brother sounds like a terrible parent though. He's putting his ego before his child. He needs to get over himself.", "NTA, he\u2019s a dad and that should come before hating his ex.

But they have a child together, and he needs to figure out how to put that anger aside when it comes to Ava. \u201cI\u2019m fine with my child resenting me\u201d is such a selfish, shortsighted take. He doesn\u2019t have to be Marie\u2019s buddy, but only communicating with her *via notebook* is absolutely unacceptable. He needs to at least be able to hold a conversation with her. (And because I know people are gonna start screaming \u2018misandry\u2019 at me: I would say the same thing if this were a man.) Ava should be able to talk about her mother and have her at her birthday party if that\u2019s what she wants. \n\nFurthermore, the custody thing makes me kind of uncomfortable. If Ava loves her mother, and is well cared for at her house, then why mess with the custody agreement? Struggling financially doesn\u2019t make someone a bad parent.

He is making his daughter walk on eggshells and seems absolutely oblivious to her feelings. You should point this out because his own actions now will likely isolate him from his daughter. Never put a child in the middle of adults problems. Be civil at events she may want both parents there for.\n\nHe doesn't have to like her. He does need to learn how to tolerate her. And if he goes for 100% custody and that is not what his daughter wants, he will likely lose his daughter. He cannot force her to hate her mother. Isolating her from her mother will likely backfire big time.", "YTA. Who are you to judge him for how he is handling his pain and his broken marriage.

Not how it works. When you become a parent, do you get to choose not to feel uncomfortable because you don\u2019t like changing diapers? Or you don\u2019t like not getting enough sleep? Or you don\u2019t like taking your kids to the doctor? No. As a parent, you have to do things that make you uncomfortable, because a good parent does things, things they don\u2019t like, to help their child have a well adjusted upbringing. \n\nDivorcing a spouse on the grounds of infidelity is whatever. When a kid is involved you need to have healthy boundaries and communication so you can effectively coparent the child. It is not the child\u2019s fault or responsibility that one parent cheated on the other or that one parent can\u2019t go to therapy to learn how to deal with being cheated on. I am not saying he should forgive mom, I\u2019m not saying her actions weren\u2019t deplorable.

That being said effectively co parenting doesn\u2019t mean he has to share dinners and birthday party\u2019s either. Just good communication and not acting like you loath the other person while the child is present and putting your child first is enough. \n\nYou are correct that his daughter will grow up to resent it.

He needs to put his need for revenge against his ex behind that of the well-being of his daughter otherwise his worst nightmare will become true and his daughter will end up siding and being more close with her mother.

He needs to be polite when he's around her for the sake of his daughter and it would be best that he doesn't say anything at all about what he actually thinks of her in Ava's presence.  Ava should not be scared to say stuff about her mother in Joe's presence.  Joe should be listening to his daughter and validating her thoughts but not putting his feelings on top of those thoughts.\n\nJoe owes Marie absolutely nothing over what has happened.  Marie cheated... Joe is right to have divorced her as the trust is gone.  Joe owes her nothing right now.\n\nWhat sort of help has Marie asked of Joe?  Is it specifically for Ava?  Or it is to run her household?  Seeing as she has lost her job, she can ask the courts to relook at alimony (based on her income) unless there was something in the divorce agreement that stops her from doing this.  If that's the case, then Marie needs to find another job (which she needs to do anyway).  That's not Joe's problem.\n\nThere was no requirement for Joe to invite Marie to the party he threw for Ava.

One will be that Joe and Marie will never get back together (by the sounds of things) and that mom's house will be different from dad's house and there will be two sets of rules and the finances are different.  Ava has the right to choose who she wants to live with and she also deserves to have a relationship with both parents and neither of those parents should take our their anger of the situation on Ava in the form of trying to destroy the other parent.\n\nJoe would benefit from some counselling and so would Ava.\n\nThe thing you need to remind Joe about is that this is about Ava and not about him and Marie.
