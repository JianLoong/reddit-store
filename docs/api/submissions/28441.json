Not only that, but she couldn\u2019t even talk to her mom on her own birthday had she not shown up. Your brother gets to be pissed but his anger is dangerously misdirected.

Ask her what she's feeling and offer to be her advocate rather than doing what you think is best. Just a thought.", "NTA or ESH.\n\nObviously Marie is for cheating and she broke the one happy family, but Joe like you said is going to have his daughter resent him a lot. Ava is still young and needs her mother in her life. This post isn't about Marie cheating it's about Joe's treatment of Marie that is effecting Ava.\n\nAva needs therapy and so does Joe a lot. It's been half a decade and he shouldn't still be feeling this kind of resentment towards his daughter's mother half a decade later. \n\nHe'll realize it too late what kind of hurt and mental distress he is causing Ava. He is only focused on hurting Marie and not about how he is hurting Ava.\n\nEdit: You mentioned how Ava is afraid to even mention her Mother to her dad which isn't okay. No child should be afraid to mention their parent to the other. He needs therapy and shouldn't be taking it out on Ava.", "NTA, my mom is Joe in this story, and I hate her for it.  There is no co-parenting happening because of Joe. This was not helpful for me from my mom growing up, and it's not helpful for Ava from her dad. Gender is irrelevant, Joe and Marie decided to have a kid, and both want to be in her life. If that's the case, it's the parents' job to buck up and co-parent professionally, not avoid it. Co-parenting doesn't mean you have to get along with the other parent. It means being there for your kid. My mom left my wedding early because she just couldn't handle it, and I honestly still resent her for it.\n\nAva shouldn't be punished because of her parents' choices.", "You are NTA for being concerned about how this animosity is affecting your niece.  It's so sad when adults allow their issues to bleed over to the children who are ill equipped to deal with these issues.  \n\nThat said, Marie knows Joe does not want her around and she really should not have crashed the birthday party that he was a part of.  She should have had her own separate celebration instead.  She knew her presence would not be well received by him, and she should have thought not to visit this upon her daughter at her birthday party.  I hate it when parents can't stuff it when they need to for the wellbeing of their children.\n\nChildren need to be allowed to love both parents, even when those parents are not perfect and have problems with each other.  You are right that your niece will likely, in time, resent what she is being subjected to right now and certainly denying her acknowledging her mother in her father's presence is damaging.  I get where your brother didn't appreciate your comments as he is too consumed with his anger at his ex-wife, but you are likely right here.", "NTA. I appreciate you sticking up for Ava. I'm divorced and my ex tries to alienate me from our child. Sadly, his family is fully on his side (mine is on my side), and the only person who loses is our child. What is his reasoning for wanting 100% custody? Just financial? That seems extremely vindictive and not at all fair to Ava who probably needs her mom as she navigates the teen years. Your brother needs to grow up.", "He is not an asshole. He just doesn't want his daughter to be a lazy whole like her mother", "NTA, ask your brother when he's gonna start loving his daughter more than he hates his ex, because until then he's a miserable excuse for a father.", "NTA\n\nShe'll grow up and understand her father is selfish and put his hurt feelings over her well-being.", "NTA\n\nKids always come first, no matter what. If the ex was a bad parent, different story, but from what you've said she isn't. \n\nYour brother sounds like a terrible parent though. He's putting his ego before his child. He needs to get over himself.", "NTA, he\u2019s a dad and that should come before hating his ex.

He\u2019s letting his anger get the best of him. That is if he wants a good relationship with her in the future if he doesn\u2019t then he can keep doing what he\u2019s doing.

But my mom never refused to hear about the things I did with my dad, or when I told her how my half siblings were doing.\n\nThey are even getting birthday greetings from each other and a short message on Christmas/New year.\n\nShe also asks me occasionally how he's doing and if his family is doing well.\n\nI am so grateful for my mom that despite having a divorce, she still realises that my brother and I still have a father who is important to us, despite the cheating he has done.\n\nI only have one mother and father and I would be pissed as hell if I am not allowed to talk about an important part in my life.\n\nOP is definitely NTA here for looking out for her niece.", "Question and I don\u2019t mean this in a rude way\u2026. Why should he help his ex wife and with what?

I hate to say it but if this was reversed no one would say anything negative about Marie.  \n\nAlso if a parent can\u2019t take care of their kid it falls on the other parent.

Sure, the guy was a slimeball, but he was a loving father. He just didn\u2019t want her anymore and moved on way too soon with someone way too young.", "Says the aunt with absolutely no clarification of why she feels this way. Is she afraid he\u2019ll yell and scream? Is she afraid because she knows he\u2019s heartbroken. Two very different things.   \nThis is the same woman who wants her brother to be kind to the woman who ruined his life. I see nothing in this post that even suggests he\u2019s been less than civil.

That\u2019s complete speculation on your part entirely.", "Why Ava even have to bring up her mother to her dad?

No one including OP seems to know exactly what's happening between him and his ex because he's not talking to anyone. Op seems to think he should be helping her since she's out of work and didn't seem to think it was an issue that the ex crashed her birthday party.

There isnt information about how her life with mom is", "We will never agree on this. I feel for the dude", "One of the main points op uses was that he was pissed she showed up to his party for his daughter.  Op needs to stay out of this", "He's not \"not talking about it\" though. He's displaying such anger when her name is mentioned that his own child is too scared of him to mention details of the 50% of her life she spends with her other parent. \n\nThat's not healthy for anyone concerned.", "Yeah, so OP is saying stop all this and is right?!", "It's not.... but how does more communication about his ex make this better? I am pretty sure him talking only makes this worse.", "Op seems to be leaving stuff out.  Op also seems to think the ex deserves his help since she lost her job and that his ex showing up toba party she was told not to go to isn't a big deal.", "He\n\ndoesn't \n\nhave\n\nto\n\ntalk.\n\nJust not react angrily if his daughter says \"Mum and I went for ice cream in this new place\" as part of a casual conversation - a reaction so extreme that his own child is scared to mention that her other parent exists.\n\nHe should get therapy before he messes his child up any further. She should not suffer the consequences of her parents' relationship breakdown any more than she already has. She's the innocent party in this.", "Well it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s birthday party so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s why. And I\u2019m also guessing the daughter wanted her there.
