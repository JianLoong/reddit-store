You do not know what Uncle knows, you are making assumptions based on the fact that no one talks about this means that no one knows. You \u2018feel he has a right to know\u2019 but that right doesn\u2019t equate to him even wanting to know. If this girl wants to reach out, that is her choice as he is her birth father. It doesn\u2019t sound like she is asking you to interfere so you are also taking that choice from her. \n\nWithout information that honestly isn\u2019t yours to be concerned with, you are completely unaware of any circumstances and fallout from past events that are in play here. Your knowledge extends only to the fact that this girl is related to you and believes your uncle to be her biological father. That\u2019s it. Everything further is an assumption you are making or a conclusion you are drawing and does not have the benefit of historical knowledge. This is something that she can choose to pursue or leave. If your uncle chooses to do a dna account like you did then he will also have this information. Let me ask you this. Most adults I know are aware that these websites (ancestry and 23andMe and more) exist. Have you considered he has not submitted dna because he may know of her existence and doesn\u2019t want to be found? \n\nI\u2019m adopted and was able to determine the names of my biological parents through both of the above websites however neither parent submitted dna. My matches were all cousins 2nd generation and further removed but there is a lot of information you can find even from that. If my biological parents wanted to find me, it would be easy for them to have submitted their dna to these sites to see what could be found. But they didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t submit my dna until I felt comfortable with potentially finding my biological family because I didn\u2019t want some random person trying to connect the dots for me. My point is that your understanding of what your uncle\u2019s \u2019rights to know\u2019 is actually quite shallow and simplistic in a very complex situation. Don\u2019t overstep here.

One of your cousins or another family member might do a test & then if you didn\u2019t say anything they might get angry at you for \u201chiding\u201d it from them. Your best course of action is to privately contact your uncle, provide him with the information, you then send a message to the woman & let her know you\u2019ve told your uncle & then you stay out of it.
