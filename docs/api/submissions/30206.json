Your sister wasn\u2019t complaining about music or the tv. She complained about your mother *breathing*. What\u2019s your mom supposed to do, smother herself? I feel for her, that she has to deal with this issue, but she needs to be proactive and wear noise canceling headphones or earbuds. If the problem is that they don\u2019t work, then your parents need to shell out for ones that do.", "NTA. There\u2019s being accommodating, and there\u2019s being walked on. You\u2019re not allowed to move in bed because the sheets make noise? Sis needs to get ear plugs and learn to cope with her situation and get over the \u201ceveryone needs to cater to me\u201d mindset.", "NTA.     Put the headphones on and respect those trying to sleep.", "One comment said she has earplugs but refuses to wear them. She is also annoyed by the sound of breathing. What does she honestly expect people to do, hold their breath for the entire night? NTA, but your sister certainly is.", "It\u2019s her job to find ways to cope with her disorder. Not demand the world adapt. Headphones and earplugs will be her friends.", "NTA your parents are the people who need to see to her needs. Misophonia isn't easy to deal with for the person, nor the people who have to be around them. Your parents need to find a solution that works for both of you.", "NTA she\u2019s going to have this disorder, her whole life, and will have a very tough time if she doesn\u2019t figure out a way to adapt herself to her environment, rather than expecting her environment to adapt to her. Ruffling the bedsheets are you kidding?", "NTA. I have the same issue and I wear Loops (earplugs) or my headphones when I get overstimulated. If someone is as doing something like clicking a pen repeatedly or chewing with their mouth open that\u2019s one thing, but you can\u2019t be expected to not live your lives because it bothers her.", "NTA for your feelings, how you worded it, well that was a bit harsh.  Your sister needs to learn how to adapt.  The things you mentioned were not loud to us in anyway and if she is this sensitive then your right, she needs to use ear plugs, headphones or maybe even a white noise machine to help her.  To reasonably accommodate her is one thing... these things are simply not reasonable", "NTA These are normal sounds beyond your control. She needs to invest in ear buds.", "NTA she\u2019s probably got got heightened anxiety from being in a hotel room. She needs to do some deep breathing, put on head phones and whatever else she knows for self-calming.", "Misophonia is not get recognized as a disorder-however-many psychologists, audiologists and OTs are pushing for it.  I\u2019m actually on a team of psychs, audiologists and OTs working together to help kids with it.  Right now the best approach is to rule out any underlying cause and then use CBT as well as OT.  Ask her to hone in on her other senses-the more she strengthens those-the less focus she will have on the noises", "NTA. Tell her to put the headphones on or she can catch a beating.", "NTA your entitled sister should wear her earphones", "NTA. If your Mom breathing was bothering her then she needed to use her headphones. It's not like your Mom can just stop breathing.", "NTA - confined space and not a lot of options. You can\u2019t breath without it bothering her isn\u2019t really your problem. She has to cope with it and earplugs  are just about the only solution.", "NTA", "NAH?\n\nShe can't control her sensory issues and you can't stop existing in her general proximity.\n\nWhy hasnt mom bought her some noise canceling headphones??", "As someone with misophonia, nta.\n\nBUT that annoying fucking clacking of nail extensions or the obnoxious keypad noise is something that you can make a difference on. Turn the keyboard sounds off, and don't have obnoxious claws.", "Omg poor girl. Have you done any research at all about this disorder? It literally used to be diagnosed as schizophrenia because it makes people go crazy due to hearing every single sound outside and inside their own bodies. Please do everything you can to appease her. This is not a joke or her looking for attention. She needs treatment and understanding. Please do everything you can.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't have this disorder, but I wake easily and am sensitive to sound. So I always have earplugs on me when I will be traveling and sleeping elsewhere. I don't expect my partner or friends to not move or breathe because it may bother me. If she can deal with it out in public enough to travel, she can either wear earplugs or cover her head with a pillow and try to ignore it.", "NTA she can adapt... as long as you are not purposely antagonizing her", "Nta she's acting like a child she should learn how to cope in the world.

People get committed for this.", "Well then there really is no fix for this particular situation then, considering that they\u2019re in a hotel.", "No there really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a horrible situation for her sister. There is no way for her calm down.", "It\u2019s a horrible situation for everyone, sister just gets the shorter end of the stick."]}
