Your sister needs to learn how to adapt.

I\u2019m actually on a team of psychs, audiologists and OTs working together to help kids with it.  Right now the best approach is to rule out any underlying cause and then use CBT as well as OT.

For me it would have gone a LONG way for anyone to acknowledge how frustrating it has to be to feel how I did/acknowledge how hard it was for me to be trapped with sounds from my perspective. Try this before asking her to help herself out and give herself some rest with the earplugs. She\u2019ll probably feel guilty for causing a scene and comply when shown some validation towards what she\u2019s experiencing and given a chance to calm down/feel back to normal.", "I have misophonia.  I also have earplugs, noise canceling earbuds, etc.  \n\nFolks don't understand what it's like to not be capable of tuning out sounds the way most can, or don't even notice them.  It's a visceral reaction to a sound that makes you angry and anxious.  The closest thing I can think of is it's sort of like the physical and emotional reaction you might get if you're watching a movie in a theatre and someone in front of you keeps talking and simply will not shut up no matter what.  \n\nIt's not logical and it's not the person's fault that they're BREATHING but your brain and body react the same way.  You don't do it, but you want to scream at the theatre talkers to STFU and your body wants to get up and hit them over the head.  Only no one understands why because it's not a theatre and they're barely making any noise at all.  \n\nShe's a kid, though.  So try being understanding and you may get further with getting her to wear the earplugs.  Maybe she needs different ones.  I know I tried a bunch before finding some that were comfortable.", "NAH. \n\nYou  and your mother perhaps don't understand just how serious and disabling misophonia is. It can be so extreme as to make people feel suicidal. I think you need to educate yourselves and then you'll realise that for the sake of her mental health, you and your family ***do*** need to adapt. I live with someone with extreme misophonia and at times it's led to us having to alter significantly the way we behave. We cannot eat meals together, for example. \n\nYou should all learn from this experience and recognise that your sister sleeping with other people in the room is no longer tenable. So next time you travel together, this will have to be taken into account. \n\nThere are earplugs available for people with misophonia (and other hypersensitivity disorders) that your mother could investigate for your sister. Regular headphones (even noise cancelling ones) might not be sufficient. \n\nYour sister isn't just \"moaning\". She is in significant psychological distress. Accommodating her needs is no different from adapting a home to be accessible to someone in a wheelchair.", "NTA\n\nWhat she's calling \"respect\" is actually expecting everyone to walk on eggshells for the sake of her never experiencing discomfort. She is in a shared hotel room, which means she's going to have to deal with it and cope, especially when it seems like everything sets her off.\n\nHonestly, shits like that post I think I saw on here where a woman's daughter \"had\" misophonia, but her trigger was explicitly her mothers voice. Apparently the status quo in the household was that her mother just would not talk. Ever. The conflict was that since the daughter was moving out the mother was saying, \"yea, I'm gonna start talking again.\"", "I\u2019m so glad this topic came up. I 78f have my granddaughter (25) living with me. She is driven crazy by sounds. I had never er heard of misphonia. She can be across the den from me with the TV on and tell me my clicking on my iPhone screen is driving her crazy.  If I crunch ice, it really bothers her. At least I know why now. NTA but neither is your sister. She should adapt to noise canceling earphones though. My grand has a toddler so that doesn\u2019t work for us.", "NTA. No doubt everyone is trying to keep quiet, but your sister also needs to take reasonable steps to alleviate some of problem.", "NTA, I also have misophonia and have huge issues with mouth & chewing sounds, breathing, and any tapping sounds. Though occasionally I might snap, it is my responsibility to manage it without taking it out on the ones around me. I have noise cancelling headphones and when I eat in a group I wear plugs or headphones to minimize the sounds. Though I understand your sisters frustration she should manage it better. NTA", "NTA, I have Misphonia it sucks but it's not for others to adapt to it, you put earplugs or earphones in to block it out.", "NTA. It seems that she needs therapy and needs to be reminded that her earphones exist for a reason.   She is not the center of the universe.", "Nta what does she want to to do not breathe she needs to wear headphones or something the world does not revolve around her", "Nta. Earplugs.", "NTA, that\u2019s her problem, she needs headphones.", "Ask her to borrow her headphones.. tell her the sound of her whining is bothering you.", ">we should respect her when she tells us something is bothering her\n\nLife is going to be rough for her...", "SHE could have brought earplugs.\n\nNTA", "NAH. I have a teen with misophonia, and it can be maddening. Your parents need to help her. My daughter also absolutely cannot do headphones because they exacerbated her other sensory issues, but loops do work for her.", "NTA.  If she's that sensitive, your family should have figured out a better solution beforehand.", "NTA I have this too and while it\u2019s HORRIBLE I just put on white noise earphones", "INFO: Is there a reason she didn't get her own room? Earplugs amplify your own noises like heartbeat and breathing, so they can be hard for people with Misophonia. With therapy and time she'll hopefully learn coping strategies, but it doesn't sound like she can handle sharing a room right now. \n\nYou don't have to adapt to her, breathing is pretty darn important, but that doesn't mean her disorder doesn't need to be accommodated. It's your parents responsibility to make sure that's the case, and it's not her fault they didn't do that.", "Unless the symbiote took over your sister, you do not need to accomodate her sound problems.", "This is such a difficult situation. My sister has this but was shamed for most of her young adult life. She didn\u2019t know what it was until her late thirties. To be fair, no-one in our family knew what it was back then. It was so frustrating.  Once she figured out what the issue was she went over-board trying to control our actions and saying we didn\u2019t care and telling us about all the trauma we caused her.  But\u2026.once she had time to process, she realized that she had to protect herself and not make everyone else responsible for her suffering.  I totally got it and was very conscious of my actions around her while some other family members felt very impositioned and were outspoken about their need to have their rights as well.  However, i did get to a point when i had had enough and had a long conversation with her. I said\u2026. I cant control my sleeping noises. I can control how i eat around you. I cant control how i breath or cough, but i can control how i make other noises. We have to agree on boundaries.   I don\u2019t want to constantly walk on eggshells around my sister. She has great earplugs to use when necessary. I smile and nod and don\u2019t draw attention.  Some of my family members feel affronted when she does this and give her a hard time. They feel they\u2019re being mocked or shamed for normal sounds.  This can be such a devastating illness for those who suffer. Its equally hard for those who don\u2019t understand the affects for the person who has this.  I can still feel my frustration over being called out for every little noise that triggers my sister. That said, she and i talk about it very respectfully and we have grown tremendously through this.  There are sometimes she just huffs and walks away at a particular sound that sets her off. I have learned to ignore this as she clearly is being triggered.  She has told me to ignore it when she gets triggered because she cant control her response in that moment. Because i care and respect her we have come up with ways to deal.  It breaks my heart when she\u2019s triggered to the point of crying.  That always had to do with other\u2019s responses to her being triggered.  She still gets shamed.  She has to remove herself from situations that will trigger.  It can be an isolating disease but there are ways to live with it. That said, you are not responsible for her disorder and I totally understand your frustration but you and your sister should have some conversations and learn how to meet halfway.  As for her denigrating your mom or others, have that conversation too. \n\nOne other comment\u2026. She may be at the age where she\u2019s using her disorder to control as shes feeling out of control herself.  Make sure you and your family learn how to support her through this. Just because she has this doesn\u2019t make it ok to make others miserable too without making the effort to find a peaceful solution.", "Dunno\u2026.my partner sometimes mouth breathes and the RAGE I feel when when he does it is ridiculous. Not saying the sister is right but my.god.the.mouth.breathing \ud83d\ude21", "Precisely. It's a serious condition and needs to be treated as such - by the parents!", "Op said She has earplugs but refuses to wear them", "She's 13. It's actually her parents job to teach her how to live with her disorder. The parents are real ahs here.", "She's literally a child. It's not her job, yet. She needs parental support for her disorder... Unless we need disordered and disabled kids to bootstrap themselves out of it for some reason.", "I feel like you don't understand misphonia. It's not like regular hearing. It's often a symptom of various conditions and disorders that very much has a neurological component (you can't just 'adapt' as you out it).", "Oh, the wonder of the world, a child is behaving like a child. She's 13, not 31. It's her parents job to teach her to cope. It's not about the world revolving about her, it's her parents' obligation to make their child's health the priority. She needs help from adults, at this age she can't hire a separate room, go the the doctor or even go choose specific earphones for herself - things which help with medical conditions are more expensive than regular earphones.", "She didn\u2019t get her own room because we don\u2019t have a lot of money.. basically everyone in our family has some type of disorder or mental illness including my mom so she just don\u2019t have the mental capacity to handle her all the time", "Just as a recommendation from experience. If she has trouble with ear plugs ones that are fitted for her ear may be an option. I am pretty noise sensitive but sleeping with ear plugs made my ears sore and was painful. The custom made ones are expensive but I never had trouble wearing them again so it pays off.", "As a fellow sensory issue sufferer, your sister is the rear end of an entitled donkey.\n\nShe has noise reducing gear that is specifically designed to help manage her issue. Not your fault she's being entitled.", "This was funny even though I have to mouth breath a lot because I can't breathe properly through my nose lol.", "Right, she's a child, she can't change her circumstances and she can't sleep. Parents are AH for not making sure she was accommodated and able to sleep on their trip.\n She's surely gonna be really cranky and feeling even worse in the morning\n\nAnd re the earplugs..  she already has sensory issues with noise, it's very possible she has sensory issues with the feeling of earplugs/ earphones in her ears.", "I am not in need  of an education, but thank you.  I know enough, I also know we are all have to learn to deal with whatever difficulty/circumstances we have. At the end of the day no matter what it is, we all do better when we learn to adapt and use tools available to us to manage whatever condition or situation we have.", "Well if breathing bothers her, earplugs are going to be a pain as well as she'll hear her own breathing..", "Could be an issue with comfortablitity (not uncommon for those with hearing sensory issues to have othrr sensory issues), ability to sleep or keep them in while sleeping, or things like that. I know headphones make it 1000x harder for me to sleep and are just as destracting to wear as it is hearing other sounds - but I might be projecting.", "Well, if she has sensory issues, earplugs would suck, and they're gross. Sounds like mom is just chasing out on helping her cope and therefore effing with the girls relationship. I guess I'd revise to mom's the A H but it would blow the vote", "Earplugs amplify your bodies noises (heartbeat, breathing, etc), so they might not help her. She definitely should be in therapy though, and if possible not share a room for now.", "People with regularly long bails learn to use keyboards without their nails. It's in part how they protect them and also its more functional.", "Headphones often intensify your own sounds. They also emit their own sounds just by casually wearing them. Every little micro movement of them over or in your ear too. It's not like some average person trying  to block out other sounds.\n\nNAH", "It\u2019s the same with my partner. I know he can\u2019t help it but the red mist is real \ud83d\ude02", "This is the way we all need to approach life. Good answer.", "I guess she uses earplugs?\ud83e\udd2e agree it's hard to sleep with headphones if you're a side sleeper.... But a white noise machine (fan)or earbuds and a sleep app?", "Moms the asshole for breathing? Lmao. And how are earplugs gross?", "There are ones specifically made for this kind of thing though right? I\u2019m autistic and have the same problem, either wear earplugs or get a room by herself.", "So she can then police her own movement instead of the three other people in the room.", "Moms the asshole for not helping her child to learn how to live with her condition. Also, they could have taken a several bedrooms room.", "Sis needs to throw on some headphones with light music. Drowns out the body noises. Honestly though sounds more like teenage angst vs misophonia. I'm tapping as hard as I can on my phone and I can't hear a thing. \n\nUnless OP has the typing sound on...then she's the asshole.", "Like... a room with several bedrooms? When you have a child with medical condition you have to accommodate them. The parents here are like people who book a room on the 3rd floor with no elevator when having a child with limited mobility. The commenters here are like people who tell that the child should learn to cope and crawl up and down the stairs, since the world doesn't revolve around her.", "She's 13, she can't get a room by herself. But I wonder what the parents are thinking, taking single room with a misophonic kid.", "How do you know she is not helping? It is not like she could magically wave a mom-wand and make all the issues disappear. Even with complete perfect support, it takes a lot of time and effort to learn how to live with conditions like that.", "If sis was truly bothered she would go for a walk or listen to some light music.", "Ah yes, more sounds to hear intensified. Occasionally people can use one noise to drown out others but more common is to be overloaded by *every* sound. Even sounds you may not even hear yourself (or at least not that you process).", "I really think you're confusing misophonia with a different audio processing disorder.\n\nEither way, if simply stepping outside or listening to low music is overbearing for OPs sister she needs to stay indoors and work with a therapist."]}
