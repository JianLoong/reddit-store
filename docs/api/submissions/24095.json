If your family gets super upset about you not allowing them to stay with you for a couple weeks, then they can foot the bill to put them up in a hotel.", "NTA!  Your home is YOUR home. You do not need to cater to anyone and you definitely do not need to bring anyone you don\u2019t want into your home. \n\nOne way to approach this would be to support them coming to visit however \u2014 do not let them stay with you. You can use the move as an excuse and/or imply it over a text or a phone conversation \u201cwe\u2019d love to see you guys down here, let me know where you\u2019re staying and we can arrange some days to tour the town!\u201d. Or something along these lines to imply you will come to them not vice versa. \nYou can even recommend places \u201cwe\u2019re still getting to know the area but I\u2019ve done some research and \u201cINSERT hotel/Air BNB/etc\u201d looks great!\u201d", "NTA\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one place we should be comfortable, it\u2019s at home. \n\nPerhaps you can hide your social media from her, put her on a restricted profile.\n\nPre-package some responses, like:\n- It\u2019s going to take us a while to settle in. \n- Those dates don\u2019t work for us. \n- We aren\u2019t able to accommodate guests right away.", "NTA If you're afraid of telling her not to visit (uninvited) the family already is broken! She also doesn't seem to be much of a loss. It's better to cut her off than being manipulated and used.", "NTA \n\n>I just feel like she is using us to have a cheap place to stay on a dream vacation and that the whole time they are here it would be a nightmare\n\nYou summed it up perfectly. It's not worth the trouble.", "NTA - Your SIL sounds exhausting-continue to keep her away from your family. If she insists on visiting & it\u2019s important to keep the family peace, then tell her you are just getting settled into your new home and exploring your new city yourselves. No guests allowed right now while y\u2019all are adjusting to the new location. \n\nIt\u2019s a weak excuse, but it might buy ya some time. Good luck OP!", "NTA. There is no reason on this planet to have an awful person as a guest in your home. All that guarantees is that you will have a miserable time while housing and feeding them. Don't do it. \n\nHowever in terms of avoiding a family crisis by saying a direct \"NO\" to her visiting at all, you can just keep insisting that \"now'' (when ever she floats the idea of visiting) is not a good time. You don't have to give her details. If she presses you for \"if not now when?\" tell her things are too complicated now and you will have to get back to her about it. Of course given how busy and complicated your life is getting back to her will just slip your mind........", "NTA. Tell her that with the impending move, you aren't  able to host anyone beforehand. Tell her to let you know when they will be in your city and the families can meet up for lunch or dinner.", "NTA\n\nIf it's only her that you don't like, tell them that the bil and child can come, but she can't. If they ask why, tell them that you don't like her and don't want her in your home. Just be honest. If everybody in the family was honest, maybe it would help bil take off his rose colored glasses and see the asshole he married for who she is."]}
