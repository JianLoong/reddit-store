If your family gets super upset about you not allowing them to stay with you for a couple weeks, then they can foot the bill to put them up in a hotel.", "NTA!  Your home is YOUR home. You do not need to cater to anyone and you definitely do not need to bring anyone you don\u2019t want into your home. \n\nOne way to approach this would be to support them coming to visit however \u2014 do not let them stay with you. You can use the move as an excuse and/or imply it over a text or a phone conversation \u201cwe\u2019d love to see you guys down here, let me know where you\u2019re staying and we can arrange some days to tour the town!\u201d. Or something along these lines to imply you will come to them not vice versa. \nYou can even recommend places \u201cwe\u2019re still getting to know the area but I\u2019ve done some research and \u201cINSERT hotel/Air BNB/etc\u201d looks great!\u201d", "NTA\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one place we should be comfortable, it\u2019s at home. \n\nPerhaps you can hide your social media from her, put her on a restricted profile.\n\nPre-package some responses, like:\n- It\u2019s going to take us a while to settle in. \n- Those dates don\u2019t work for us. \n- We aren\u2019t able to accommodate guests right away.", "NTA If you're afraid of telling her not to visit (uninvited) the family already is broken! She also doesn't seem to be much of a loss. It's better to cut her off than being manipulated and used.", "NTA \n\n>I just feel like she is using us to have a cheap place to stay on a dream vacation and that the whole time they are here it would be a nightmare\n\nYou summed it up perfectly. It's not worth the trouble.", "NTA - Your SIL sounds exhausting-continue to keep her away from your family. If she insists on visiting & it\u2019s important to keep the family peace, then tell her you are just getting settled into your new home and exploring your new city yourselves. No guests allowed right now while y\u2019all are adjusting to the new location. \n\nIt\u2019s a weak excuse, but it might buy ya some time. Good luck OP!", "NTA. There is no reason on this planet to have an awful person as a guest in your home. All that guarantees is that you will have a miserable time while housing and feeding them. Don't do it. \n\nHowever in terms of avoiding a family crisis by saying a direct \"NO\" to her visiting at all, you can just keep insisting that \"now'' (when ever she floats the idea of visiting) is not a good time. You don't have to give her details. If she presses you for \"if not now when?\" tell her things are too complicated now and you will have to get back to her about it. Of course given how busy and complicated your life is getting back to her will just slip your mind........", "NTA. Tell her that with the impending move, you aren't  able to host anyone beforehand. Tell her to let you know when they will be in your city and the families can meet up for lunch or dinner.", "NTA\n\nIf it's only her that you don't like, tell them that the bil and child can come, but she can't. If they ask why, tell them that you don't like her and don't want her in your home. Just be honest. If everybody in the family was honest, maybe it would help bil take off his rose colored glasses and see the asshole he married for who she is.", "Tell her she can visit anytime she wants and send a list of hotels.", "NTA, your best defense right now. \"Please let us get settled before we have any visitors\". Than set rules for how long a visitor can stay. Even better find a small place with no room for visitors. I don't care what country you moved to, guest should not be staying weeks, that is not a guest.", "She is no doubt befriending you again with the intention of a free stay. I am not a beat around the bush person but since you dont want drama. Have your husband talk to his brother privately about his wife and why she isnt welcome. He has allowed her to destroy the family dynamics and it is he who should break the news about why her visit are not desired. \nExplain you are protecting your kids and an adult bully cannot be in the same space. In the end she wont like it, she\u2019ll no doubt send nasty messages in retaliation so what did you lose exactly?  Nothing \nId keep a in touch with the brother independent of his wife.

There is zero reason to put up with her behavior.", "NTA. \n\nI think you should try what I did to handle my cousin who is like this. I never told her she can't move to my city. In fact, I told her that I don't care if she does. I then followed that up by clarifying that my city is big enough for the both of us, and I don't plan to do anything to lessen the distance between us. I think what I said was, \"I don't care of you move here because it's certainly large enough for the both of us. But to be clear: I like the distance between us because it protects me from your verbal abuse. Moving here will not change that. I'll continue the distance between us regardless of where you live.\"", "NTA.  And while typically the correct advise would be to remind you that \"No.\" is a complete sentence, I understand why that might not work in this scenario.  However, saying right now is not a good time for a visit becuase you need to get settled in.  That would work for a while -  just keep repeating that phrase over and over.  It is very difficult for someone to argue with it not being a good time right now because that leaves the future open.  Then, if she gets even more forceful about it, tell her you would be thrilled to suggest some hotels near your home and you would love to grab lunch/dinner when she is in the area.

Cut out the undoubtedly horrible experience between now and her coming up with a new reason to be offended...her visiting. She will make you wait on her hand and foot for two weeks.  Just say NO.", "The drama will occur if she visits, so by refusing to host her, you will be avoiding drama.\n\nYes, your relatives will push in to scold you, but they all know how impossible she is, so it won't be much and it'll blow over fast.\n\nThe best thing to do is tell her straight out that you can't stand the way she treats you and she isn't going to use you and your family for free housing on her next vacation.\n\nJust say it. She won't like it? So what? Your BIL won't like it? So what since he brought this termagant into the family in the first place?\n\nYou don't have to be around her just because you're related. Grow a spine and say no.", "Yeah, don't give her ammunition for drama.  Just keep saying \"now is not a good time\".", "This. It's hard to do, but don't be fake and invite the whole family. Instead, communicate to BIL that he and daughter can come visit, but SIL isn't welcome because of her past behavior. It won't go over well of course, but better that than SIL running roughshod over you for the duration. \n\nAnd forget about family feelings. If she and BIL had ever been told the truth about how everyone feels about her, maybe she would have tried to control her obnoxious mouth. Your own tranquil family is what's most important.", "> but don't be fake about welcoming the whole family to visit\n\nNot fake, the op said they liked the brother, and was sad the kid didn't know theirs.", "I didn't write that well. I meant fake about welcoming SIL. Thanks.", "I feel like your last paragraph accurately sums up the likely consequences. Sometimes there aren't good options, you just choose the option with the negative consequence you can live with the most.

Tell her you\u2019re so excited they get to come experience your new city and to let you know when they come to see if you can break away for an evening dinner or something and to let you know if they need restaurant or hotel recommendations. And then if they try to push staying with you just keep rinsing and repeating. Nope that won\u2019t work but you\u2019re happy to provide recommendations for them. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA- It's obvious from the way you stated that she's interested because you're going somewhere where there's stuff to see or do.\n\nOn one of those posts about things to see, you can comment how there are some great hotels in the area that they can stay in.  \n\nI think once she knows you can't stay with them. If they visit it will cool.", "NTA. Respond that you would love to meet them at their hotel and see the sights with them if you are available. Let them know that you will not be accommodating anyone for the foreseeable future because you guys will be trying to get settled in yourself. You would be more open to discussing things when you get your family back into a routine, and then never make time for that talk."]}
