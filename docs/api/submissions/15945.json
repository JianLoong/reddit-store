My friend is bisexual but only myself, his wife and her parents, his best friend, and a few other friends know as his parents are pretty openly homophobic. At the reception, when his best friend went up to give the \"best man speech\" he directly addressed the groom's parents and opened with \"Aren't you glad your son married (bride)? Bet you wouldn't be here if he ended up married to a guy.\" I think he meant it as a jab towards the groom's parents for being homophobic but that was just not okay, especially when he started cracking a few gay jokes. Those of us that knew were horrified and the groom's parents were staring in shock at their son who looked like he wanted to throw up. I was beyond pissed and got up and practically yanked the mic from the best man and ordered him to sit down before taking hold of the situation, moving along to the maid of honor's speech. The rest of the reception was understandably tense. My friend(the groom) has been beside himself because his parents and their family have been barraging him with texts. I myself have been at the receiving end of a lot of anger because apparently \"there was no way his parents would've known he was serious if I didn't make such a big deal out of it\" and \"was to blame for outing him\". I don't know, did I go too far?\n\nEdit: Groom told me he appreciated me stepping in, but it was already too late and the damage had already been done. He's refusing to talk to his best man because best man keeps trying to justify that he shouldn't be afraid of his parents and that he did him a favor by outing him because he knew he'd \"never have the balls to do it\"\n\nEdit: The gay jokes were directly implicative of the groom's previous relationships with men. And it's not like I immediately jumped up there to stop it. It went on for maybe a couple minutes with the groom getting increasingly horrified and his parents looking like they were about to walk out on the whole thing.\n\nEdit: I'm receiving angry texts from the best man and some of the groom's family because they didn't think I had the right to stop the speech.", "created_utc": 1682733930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132gfzv/aita_for_shutting_down_the_best_mans_speech/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone's sexuality is never anyone else's business unless you're fucking them, and even then you don't necessarily need to know. Since he's presumably not fucking his family, they don't need to know his sexuality if he's not comfortable with it.
