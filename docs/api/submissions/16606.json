Your dad is a shitty parent and uses his money to exert control.", "NTA,  might even benefit your brother in the end to see someone stand up to your father. Talk to your brother, though, tell him the argument wasn't his fault.\nAnd this probably goes without saying, but get financially independent from your father as soon as possible.", "NTA. But you do need to understand that your brother, as a 14 year old living with your parents, will be subjected to consequences you are not, so you may want to consider whether or not yelling in the future is in his best interest. It sounds like a really awful and abusive situation and I'm sorry you're both in it", "NTA.  Your dad is being a massive tool.

After you leave he may needs to do it more often.\nAbusive dad who is TA.", "This sounds so terrible. NTA and I think your brother in this situation was appealing to the person who he might have a hope of calming down. It sounds like your Dad has serious anger issues.", "NTA \n\nYour dad sounds abusive.  I suggest that you ask him to go to therapy otherwise your brother might need therapy. Its great that you're escaping this life, but if your father doesn't agree to therapy, make some arrangements to  make sure that your brother can be safe.

If he got angry once you got into program, he WOULD pull the funding and where would you be waiting for him.

Get out of there as soon as you can.", "NTA. Your dad sounds similar to mine; he'd always escalate the situation and point out how every tiny mistake i make is a sign that I'd fail in life (unless, of course, I change and do things according to his standards). This is pretty classic verbal abuse. My dad started mellowing over the years, in part because of age and in part because my younger brother was more mercurial and pushed back against his taunts. I think you did the right thing by standing up for yourself, and I hope your dad mellows out eventually like mine.", "NTA. I hope everything is already paid for.

Find a way to make it there and then make sure you're not letting him decide anything for you ever again.", "DEFINITELY NTA.\n\nI'm ao sorry for you and your brother for having to grow up with such a shitty and toxic dad like that.\nYou did well standing up for yourself. \nI recommend you to have a talk to your brother about it.\nScreaming doesn't solve any problem and the fact that he saw you also screaming at your dad might had leaved him sad too. I understand you needed to scream so your dad \"also heard you\" but that is not the image you want your brother to have from you, i believe. I bet your brother felt good to have someone standing up for him so, you did a god job. But maybe next time avoid the screaming. \n\"Be kind to unkind people, those are the one who need the most.\"\nIt's completely understandable that he was really upset and sad about what he saw but maybe talking with him to calm him down and tranquilize him is not a bad idea. It's a shitty situation, really.\nGood luck on your future abroad <3", "The whole time she was reading I was like \n \u201cDo we have the same father?\u201d Yelling at him won\u2019t to much good, but it\u2019s good for brother to see someone stand up to him. \n\nOP, get financially independent as soon as you can. And in future\u2026 screaming does not work with these folks. He will just scream louder and you will never win. Calmly, confidently refuse to accept responsibility for things that are not your responsibility. Speak reason, and speak it plainly and often. Let your brother see it. Let your father scream and yell at someone who isn\u2019t screaming or yelling at him, and let him look like the unhinged one. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a teenager. He just enjoyed a cruise that he should remember fondly for years. And you just destroyed the memory of it for him\u2014over socks. I refuse to accept responsibility for something that\u2019s not my responsibility.\u201d\n\nAnd.. if you really want to do what I did\u2026\n\n\u201cEvery single time one of us does something that you don\u2019t like, you threaten financial support. every time I think about standing up for myself or never speaking to you again because you can\u2019t stop bullying me, I remember I rely on your financial support. Is that honestly the kind of relationship you want with your family? One where we are beholden to you instead of appreciative of you, or fond of you? You want to trade financial support for obedience and loyalty?  You say we don\u2019t understand the value of money? I don\u2019t think you understand the value of family. And if you can\u2019t find a way to be my family and not my keeper, then you won\u2019t have one any longer.\u201d \n\nBe prepared though. This worked for me the first few times (for a few months), but eventually when he couldn\u2019t maintain any kind of change, I *did* cut him off completely. We don\u2019t speak.", "So I called his bluff that day by telling him I won't go and that he doesn't have to pay. Then he can explain to everyone who knows I'm leaving shortly about why I'm not going anymore, and how he deprived me of a life-changing opportunity such as this one. It worked, and he's still sending me. I don't think he'll be threatening me anymore. It was a huge risk though, calling his bluff like that.", "He can pick a fight over anything. It's not a new thing. He's crazy.", "He's 14. I don't blame him. It freaked him out. I don't think it's his fault.\n\nThank you. I look forward to getting out of here.", "This is a good way to deal with people, who care what the others think of them. Very clever move!", "Omg, honestly I got to this point and looked in the mirror one day and was like \"wtf is wrong with you?\" Therapy is a great tool but I'm almost certain her would never entertain the idea. \n\nIdk how long you have to leave, if it's a couple months maybe get a part time job and save everything. Nta.", "You are fine not blaming him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you asked if you were an AH - and you are not. Even if he is young and also an abuse victim (of your dad), he is STILL WRONG faulting you for your defending yourself against abuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo : Dad is the AH, and you SHOULD NOT listen to your brother and take the abuse to keep the peace. He likely does not understand what he is asking, but he is still wrong.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very fair. He\u2019s a young lad who was frightened and wanted the situation to end. He feels OP prolonged his agony by defending herself. It\u2019s not a fair assessment but I totally got why he feels that way. \n\nI\u2019ve been on several cruises and on one myself and then husband were not getting on. On a cruise there is no escape. Even if you leave the cabin you\u2019re stuck on the ship. It\u2019s not like you can go to someone else\u2019s house for a while while things cool off. This would have exacerbated his feelings a lot. The brother is a victim of this abuse too. The only AH here is dad.", "I agree - but OP STILL SHOULD NOT STOP defending herself to appease her brother.", "NTA. As soon as you can,pay him back for what he contributed, because he seems like someone who will constantly bring up the costs, since he kept threatening to not send you. Once you pay him back, and are independent, cut the guy off for a while and force him to contemplate life without you. That should put him in his place.", "IT was one pair of socks that he could actually wear the next day....", "Absolutely NTA, Your dad has anger issues and needs therapy. He can't keep blackmailing you with the money abroad every time you have a fight. He should be doing everything in his power to make sure you go abroad for your education not the other way around. \n\nI have experienced similar issues with someone I know ( not naming anyone). It took them having a fight and moving out before they could repair their relationship. Now they get on really well but they just can't live together.", "NTA OP!  Your dad sounds like he needs to have his wings clipped.", "This.  NTA\n\nIn my family, I have always been the one that stands up to my parents for my younger sisters.   But, for me, I've always been scared they would cut me off or throw me out, and I wouldn't be able to support myself.   I let that fear ruin my life, honestly.\n\nFinally stopped worrying about.  Like, pretty certain last week got me written out of the will, lol.  Not kidding.\n\nAnyway - you're right, get financially independent and stop letting them tell you what to do."]}
