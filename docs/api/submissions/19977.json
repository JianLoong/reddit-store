Nothing big, but many people I know are in fashions, so sometimes they hire me to put on their clothes and jewelry to show on their social platforms. \n\nA few days ago was my cousin Maria\u2019s 16th birthday. All the family was invited like usual for her birthdays but my parents live a little further than the rest and we sometimes couldn\u2019t make it. More often than not we just sent her gifts and well wishes. This year, however, I had a video shoot at my friend\u2019s place 40 minutes or so from Maria\u2019s house so I told Maria I would attend the party. My parents and brothers asked me to pass their gifts to Maria.\n\nI had on a sundress and went to my designer friend\u2019s place, intending to wear that dress to the party after work. As we wrapped up, however, I noticed that my dress which was hung in the corner of the room was gone. As it turned out, my friend\u2019s girlfriend thought my dress was one of my friend\u2019s works so she wore it outside. My designer friend apologized and offered me a dress to wear and promised to return my dress to me later.\n\nMy options were limited. My friend was plus sized. Her girlfriend left behind a dirty shirt and shorts. All the dresses for the shoot were long and fancy. I picked one of the more modest ones and left as I was already late for the party.\n\nI was the last person to arrive and was also the most dressed up. My relatives all showered me with compliments on how I look, even Maria\u2019s father. I didn\u2019t want to steal attention from Maria so I tried to keep close to our 80 year old grandfather who only sat still and kept quiet most of the time, but the rest of the family kept coming to greet me and complimented my dress and look. Maria thanked me for the presents and served me cake. She also thanked me when I complimented her new hairstyle. I thought everything went well.\n\nAs I drove back home, however, Maria called me, telling me I was AH for showing up looking like that and stealing attention from her. I apologized and explained my dress situation. Maria said any decent person would just buy something else to wear before coming. AITA?\n\nEdit: https://ibb.co/7gs2dqw\nDress looks kinda like this. I won\u2019t post actual pic of the dress cuz it\u2019s my friend\u2019s property.\n\nThere\u2019s no dress code for the party. The few years my family attended everyone wore whatever. One of our aunts once showed up in a full evening gown as she was on her way to a work event and nobody made a fuss.\n\nI was paid for \u201cmodeling\u201d but not a lot. My friend just started and couldn\u2019t afford more. The thought of buying another dress on top of all the gas money or burdening my friend with extra cost just didn\u2019t make sense.

Honestly, tell Maria again that you're sorry about what happened at your work and you tried to stay out of the spotlight, but I think it'd be fair to blame the other family members for being insensitive.
