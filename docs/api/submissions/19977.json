Nothing big, but many people I know are in fashions, so sometimes they hire me to put on their clothes and jewelry to show on their social platforms. \n\nA few days ago was my cousin Maria\u2019s 16th birthday. All the family was invited like usual for her birthdays but my parents live a little further than the rest and we sometimes couldn\u2019t make it. More often than not we just sent her gifts and well wishes. This year, however, I had a video shoot at my friend\u2019s place 40 minutes or so from Maria\u2019s house so I told Maria I would attend the party. My parents and brothers asked me to pass their gifts to Maria.\n\nI had on a sundress and went to my designer friend\u2019s place, intending to wear that dress to the party after work. As we wrapped up, however, I noticed that my dress which was hung in the corner of the room was gone. As it turned out, my friend\u2019s girlfriend thought my dress was one of my friend\u2019s works so she wore it outside. My designer friend apologized and offered me a dress to wear and promised to return my dress to me later.\n\nMy options were limited. My friend was plus sized. Her girlfriend left behind a dirty shirt and shorts. All the dresses for the shoot were long and fancy. I picked one of the more modest ones and left as I was already late for the party.\n\nI was the last person to arrive and was also the most dressed up. My relatives all showered me with compliments on how I look, even Maria\u2019s father. I didn\u2019t want to steal attention from Maria so I tried to keep close to our 80 year old grandfather who only sat still and kept quiet most of the time, but the rest of the family kept coming to greet me and complimented my dress and look. Maria thanked me for the presents and served me cake. She also thanked me when I complimented her new hairstyle. I thought everything went well.\n\nAs I drove back home, however, Maria called me, telling me I was AH for showing up looking like that and stealing attention from her. I apologized and explained my dress situation. Maria said any decent person would just buy something else to wear before coming.

I know shes the girlfriend, but does she just take the designer dresses without asking? at a photoshoot? She has no idea whether or not the dress is to be used in the shoot, and if its just lying somewhere, its most likely not hers to just take.", "If you're asking if you're TA for wearing a dress when you had absolutely zero other options, then the answer is obviously NTA.\n\nIs your teen cousin's feeling of upset that her model cousin showed up in a dress that has likely outshined everyone at the party including herself valid ? Yes that feeling is valid.\n\nNAH", "NTA-It amazes me how many of these posts deal with \u201cstealing attention from another person\u201d (graduate, birthday person, bride, etc). Folks seem to be more & more insecure about themselves if a mere dress or hair color/cut can ruin their day. \n\nYou did not deliberately try to outshine your cousin on her birthday. Things just got messed up at the video shoot. But you made the effort to attend her party & deliver gifts. Next year skip the party.", "Your cousin is 16. She doesn\u2019t understand yet that she can be in a room with other beautiful women & it takes absolutely nothing away from her moment. She too young to understand she was in fact the center of attention. The party was for her. She just chose to be jealous instead of appreciating your efforts to turn the attention away from yourself. You explained & apologized. There\u2019s not much more you can do. Let it go.\n\nNTA", "NTA, You had to make do because someone stole your clothes. XD", "NTA. Tell Maria any decent person would thank her cousin for coming after working and despite that awkward clothing incident\u2026.maybe even offer some comfortable clothes to wear. \n\nAlso, your friend needs to get the gf under control. She can\u2019t just take clothes hanging around and take off in them. That\u2019s insane.", "NTA - it\u2019s not your fault that there was a mixup with your dress, you did the best thing you could. You would have been even later if you had to buy a dress.\nHowever, in hindsight, it might have been better to send a courtesy text explaining the situation. But obviously that can\u2019t be remedied now", "\n\nNTA. You did not intend to wear the fancy dress and it was a simple accident that you wore it to the party. Unless someone explicitly tells you to dress causally, it is perfectly normal to dress appropriately. Your relatives probably thought you looked nice and it is understandable that they were complimenting you. You were not trying to take attention away from Maria so you should not beat yourself up for it.", "NTA on the basis you were not trying to outshine her. It was one of those things.", "NTA Maria needs to work on her insecurities. Maybe she could use help with makeup. Maybe she needs a makeover. Maybe she needs to exercise. Whatever. This is on her, not you.", "Hard to say, but being so overdressed usually makes you TA if it takes away from the guest of honor.\n\nI actually think your friend is TA b/c the correct answer is that they call the person who took your dress, explain that it is YOUR dress, and say they need to bring it back ASAP.  I didn't read the part where you both called/texted this person 20 times, so it seems like you actually just wanted to wear one of her dresses.\n\nWhile I can see in a pinch, it wouldn't make you TA, you didn't put in the requisite effort to get your own dress back.", "soft, unintentional YTA - not quite sure how you could have avoided this other than not just showing up at all, but showing up last and being significantly overdressed for the event absolutely upstages your cousin - not as serious as wearing a bridal dress to a wedding that is not yours, but kinda along the same lines.  she'll get over it tho.", "NTA, Maria sounds a bit jelous", "NTA", "NTA. I can\u2019t remember ever caring what someone wore to a party of mine. I understand if someone is purposefully being attention-seeking, but you obviously weren\u2019t.

You had an unfortunate accident. You explained. You apologized. And Maria said you need to BUY new clothes to attend her BIRTHDAY PARTY? That is wild. No. Definitely NTA.", "INFO: Show us the dress", "Right? I am constantly overdressed and nobody ever minded; I have never minded anyone dressing better than me either. Who cares?", "I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t feel comfortable wearing a dress a sweaty person had just worn. My sundress was no longer an option at that point.", "That's not clear from your post, but there are a bunch of options you didn't consider and it is still the better option vs being way too overdressed.   \n\nTypically, dress codes exist to not \"outshine\" the guest of honor. If you did that, then YWBTA.  I do think your \"designer friend\" and her gf are also AHs, but your cousin is right.", "Well, I did say in my post that her gf left behind sweaty shirt and shorts. I thought that was implied.\n\nOut of curiosity, you think I need to spend money buying new clothes, and making me arrive even later at the party, to go to the party? No sarcasm. Asking seriously here.", ">Typically, dress codes exist to not \"outshine\" the guest of honor. \n\nyeah that's not typical. Seems to be a new egotistical trend on reddit for sure, mostly coming from the US but not limited to.  \n\n\nActually typical, is it is rude to be underdressed for the dresscode but not rude to be overdressed as you are honouring the event by putting in effort", "I assumed the gf lived there, but there are multiple options that would have been better if you were that overdressed that it was problematic (including being late or calling your cousin first to ok the dress/explain the situation).  Also, since your friend/her gf caused the problem, they should have paid for a new dress that was within dress code. (But really, you are saying you didn't want to wear your own dress b/c the gf had worn it for a bit and \"gotten sweaty\" isn't the best for you - I can't imagine she went to the gym in your dress).\n\nIf you are simply asking an etiquette question, YTA for showing up overdressed.  Your friend and her GF are also TA. Your cousin is rightly entitled to her feelings, especially as you just showed up that way.\n\nIf it was a wedding and your guest dress got lost/damaged etc, you buy a new dress. You don't wear a loaner white gown b/c someone has one. It's a bit less dramatic b/c I don't know the dress code/what your cousin wore, but you don't upstage the guest of honor is the general rule of thumb. You aren't the worst person in the world, but you should apologize and stop with the excuses."]}
