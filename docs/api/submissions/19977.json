All the family was invited like usual for her birthdays but my parents live a little further than the rest and we sometimes couldn\u2019t make it. More often than not we just sent her gifts and well wishes. This year, however, I had a video shoot at my friend\u2019s place 40 minutes or so from Maria\u2019s house so I told Maria I would attend the party. My parents and brothers asked me to pass their gifts to Maria.\n\nI had on a sundress and went to my designer friend\u2019s place, intending to wear that dress to the party after work. As we wrapped up, however, I noticed that my dress which was hung in the corner of the room was gone. As it turned out, my friend\u2019s girlfriend thought my dress was one of my friend\u2019s works so she wore it outside. My designer friend apologized and offered me a dress to wear and promised to return my dress to me later.\n\nMy options were limited. My friend was plus sized. Her girlfriend left behind a dirty shirt and shorts. All the dresses for the shoot were long and fancy. I picked one of the more modest ones and left as I was already late for the party.\n\nI was the last person to arrive and was also the most dressed up. My relatives all showered me with compliments on how I look, even Maria\u2019s father. I didn\u2019t want to steal attention from Maria so I tried to keep close to our 80 year old grandfather who only sat still and kept quiet most of the time, but the rest of the family kept coming to greet me and complimented my dress and look. Maria thanked me for the presents and served me cake. She also thanked me when I complimented her new hairstyle. I thought everything went well.\n\nAs I drove back home, however, Maria called me, telling me I was AH for showing up looking like that and stealing attention from her. I apologized and explained my dress situation. Maria said any decent person would just buy something else to wear before coming.

Also, since your friend/her gf caused the problem, they should have paid for a new dress that was within dress code.

Your friend and her GF are also TA. Your cousin is rightly entitled to her feelings, especially as you just showed up that way.\n\nIf it was a wedding and your guest dress got lost/damaged etc, you buy a new dress.

I completely understand why she is upset, even if it's all very petty in the grand scheme of things. being that age is already so hard: trying to figure out a changing body, figuring out your personal style, then add constantly comparing yourself to others bc of social media... you couldn't pay me all of the money in the world to go back to being a 16 year old girl again. try to cut her some slack, swallow your pride, do a nice gesture as a peace offering, and move on. she will get over it, as will you. nothing worth blowing up a familial relationship over.", "Is there any way you could perhaps spend the day with her?

No offense to OP, who couldn't help it, but if someone showed up to a teenager's birthday party overdressed in a designer dress, I wouldn't be gushing about how great they look, I would think it weird and probably role my eyes internally.", "I'm guessing when you're in the industry clothes are treated more like shared tools than personal belongings.  So if it's in the wrong location it might be an honest misunderstanding.", "100% this", "Even at 16, this is pretty crappy.  Your cousin is hot, you invited her. It be one thing is she showed up in something inappropriate, but it's quite another to say that attractive people are under constant obligation to dial it down to the point the rest of us are comfortable with.  Cousin needs to get over herself.
