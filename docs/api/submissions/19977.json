All the family was invited like usual for her birthdays but my parents live a little further than the rest and we sometimes couldn\u2019t make it. More often than not we just sent her gifts and well wishes. This year, however, I had a video shoot at my friend\u2019s place 40 minutes or so from Maria\u2019s house so I told Maria I would attend the party. My parents and brothers asked me to pass their gifts to Maria.\n\nI had on a sundress and went to my designer friend\u2019s place, intending to wear that dress to the party after work. As we wrapped up, however, I noticed that my dress which was hung in the corner of the room was gone. As it turned out, my friend\u2019s girlfriend thought my dress was one of my friend\u2019s works so she wore it outside. My designer friend apologized and offered me a dress to wear and promised to return my dress to me later.\n\nMy options were limited. My friend was plus sized. Her girlfriend left behind a dirty shirt and shorts. All the dresses for the shoot were long and fancy. I picked one of the more modest ones and left as I was already late for the party.\n\nI was the last person to arrive and was also the most dressed up. My relatives all showered me with compliments on how I look, even Maria\u2019s father. I didn\u2019t want to steal attention from Maria so I tried to keep close to our 80 year old grandfather who only sat still and kept quiet most of the time, but the rest of the family kept coming to greet me and complimented my dress and look. Maria thanked me for the presents and served me cake. She also thanked me when I complimented her new hairstyle. I thought everything went well.\n\nAs I drove back home, however, Maria called me, telling me I was AH for showing up looking like that and stealing attention from her. I apologized and explained my dress situation. Maria said any decent person would just buy something else to wear before coming.

It be one thing is she showed up in something inappropriate, but it's quite another to say that attractive people are under constant obligation to dial it down to the point the rest of us are comfortable with.  Cousin needs to get over herself.

Why do people get so weird around a pretty woman?\n\nBased on the picture you linked in comments, the dress really isn't that spectacular.", "ESH", "> My relatives all showered me with compliments on how I look, even Maria\u2019s father. I didn\u2019t want to steal attention from Maria so I tried to keep close to our 80 year old grandfather who only sat still and kept quiet most of the time, but the rest of the family kept coming to greet me and complimented my dress and look.\n\nNTA. You had a good reason for being overdressed, due to the clothing mishap at work. Also you work as a model, you probably will often be the best dressed family member, just don't be an ass about it, which you weren't. You were aware you were overdressed and tried to stay out of the spotlight.\n\nMaria isn't TA either, as others have said she's a teenager and probably feels a little insecure about her vs your appearance. But all those family members who kept coming over to put the attention on you at her birthday party definitely made her feel insecure, and they should've had the tact to know they shouldn't have done that. Honestly, tell Maria again that you're sorry about what happened at your work and you tried to stay out of the spotlight, but I think it'd be fair to blame the other family members for being insensitive. Apologize for not asking them to stop the compliments then and there, and you could offer to talk to them on her behalf.", "\u201cI\u2019m so beautiful. I\u2019m a model. Someone took my clothes so I had to wear an evening gown that made me even more beautiful. Everyone complimented me on my beauty. Now my niece is mad that I got all the attention.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t believe this one for a second. All that was left was evening gowns? But you chose the most modest one? Oh poor little beautiful OP. LMAO", "NAH \n\nI think you both had valid and reasonable reactions. You have made it exceedingly clear that your intention was to not outshine your cousin. You did everything you could have to not outshine her. \n\nThat being said i also understand her being upset. I would give her time and space to process it. Right now everything is too emotionally charged for her to see your intentions clearly.", "NTA.", "NAH. I get where Maria is coming from, but there was literally nothing you could have done. Hopefully she will come to see the truth. Good luck.", "NTA. You\u2019re not going to buy a dress last minute for a family birthday and I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s with people not wanting anyone else to be better dressed than them on their birthday.

Or was it just a regular party?", "ESH.", "Interesting that she went off on you after getting her gifts.", "NTA I see no reason why you can't wear what you want. Especially since people usually dress up for birthdays, sounds like it's coming from a place of insecurity considering it wasn't really your fault and you weren't deliberately trying to cause that. You can't change that you look like a model", "YTA for thinking anyone here cares what you wear", "NTA. Its always confusing when I hear about people getting upset about not getting all the attention. I can't understand why they have a single fuck to give about it.", "NTA- Any decent person would be understanding of the situation and not expect someone to buy a whole new dress just so they can feel special.", "NTA. Your friend's girlfriend should have ASKED before assuming that dress was up for grabs \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fyour cousin had no right calling you up and berating you. I'm sure she would have been upset at anything you wore, to be fair.

Many people would have bailed for not having anything to wear.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t have to be there. At the end of the day. You don\u2019t have to attend extended family gatherings.

Maria is 16 and acting it, she\u2019ll either get over it soon or when she\u2019s a bit older will realise it wasn\u2019t a big deal. From what you\u2019ve described, none of your actions were wrong.", "Yeah, OP is not TA but I have sympathy for a teenager faced with this situation at a milestone party.

Ouch.", "It\u2019s worth pointing out that it wasn\u2019t just a teen\u2019s birthday party\u2026 it was her Sweet Sixteen. In many cultures, especially for girls, your 16th birthday is a BigFrickinDeal. Also, OP could have apologized and explained as soon as she arrived. Instead she said nothing until after the party, so Maria spent the whole time thinking OP was making herself the center of attention on purpose. OP explaining could have softened some of this.\n\nI guess NTA for wearing the dress (though I definitely would have stopped somewhere and bought something else.) Gentle YTA for how she handled things once she got there.", "This 100%", "> I (18f) sometimes do modeling works for friends. Nothing big, but many people I know are in fashions, so sometimes they hire me to put on their clothes and jewelry to show on their social platforms\n\nOP isn\u2019t an actual model tho.

I hate the \u201cstealing my limelight\u201d trope. These events are meant to celebrate milestones and accomplishments, which are not appearance-based. No one is going to forget who the guest of honor is if someone else is dressed nice or very attractive.\n\nIt seems more feasible that OP got attention from her relatives because she doesn\u2019t live close enough to attend family events regularly, so her relatives were excited to see her and say hello. If Maria did not want that, she shouldn\u2019t have invited her. I do want to acknowledge that she is 16 years old, so she may not be mature enough to realize that.", "Or when someone is prettier and people give them bs because they are taking attention from them\u2026 like get over yourself, there are always people smarter, prettier, more outgoing , etc. suck it up and move on!

To redirect peoples attention makes it even more noticable and OP admits she was complimented a lot. So I tend to say slightly YTA here.\n\nTo blame here, too, are the other people attending the party who did not manage to make  it all about the girl and the 1001 other things than looks that are important about someone. \ud83d\ude44 Sheeesh.", "It did not sound like she \"knew\" it was inappropriate prior to the event, to be honest, I think the cousin would have taken issue with anything she wore, if everyone gave her compliments on her appearance.", "And there you have it: easy, breezy, COVER GIRL!", "I wear dresses when I\u2019ve run out clean clothes lol.
