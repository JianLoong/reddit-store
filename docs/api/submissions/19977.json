All the family was invited like usual for her birthdays but my parents live a little further than the rest and we sometimes couldn\u2019t make it. More often than not we just sent her gifts and well wishes. This year, however, I had a video shoot at my friend\u2019s place 40 minutes or so from Maria\u2019s house so I told Maria I would attend the party. My parents and brothers asked me to pass their gifts to Maria.\n\nI had on a sundress and went to my designer friend\u2019s place, intending to wear that dress to the party after work. As we wrapped up, however, I noticed that my dress which was hung in the corner of the room was gone. As it turned out, my friend\u2019s girlfriend thought my dress was one of my friend\u2019s works so she wore it outside. My designer friend apologized and offered me a dress to wear and promised to return my dress to me later.\n\nMy options were limited. My friend was plus sized. Her girlfriend left behind a dirty shirt and shorts. All the dresses for the shoot were long and fancy. I picked one of the more modest ones and left as I was already late for the party.\n\nI was the last person to arrive and was also the most dressed up. My relatives all showered me with compliments on how I look, even Maria\u2019s father. I didn\u2019t want to steal attention from Maria so I tried to keep close to our 80 year old grandfather who only sat still and kept quiet most of the time, but the rest of the family kept coming to greet me and complimented my dress and look. Maria thanked me for the presents and served me cake. She also thanked me when I complimented her new hairstyle. I thought everything went well.\n\nAs I drove back home, however, Maria called me, telling me I was AH for showing up looking like that and stealing attention from her. I apologized and explained my dress situation. Maria said any decent person would just buy something else to wear before coming.

I feel for OP, but I hope OP can empathize with her cousin", "I see your point about professional designers, and couture clothes absolutely merit that attention to detail.\n\nHowever, OP is 18.\nNo disrespect intended, but I read this post as the tallest, thinnest and prettiest friend from a friend group helping out some friends of similar ages working in design. OP doesn't mention getting paid, right?\nLike, maybe the friend is building a portfolio or something? \n\nAlso, I remember this from an early season of project runway with Heidi Klum: a designer won the public's vote, the super trash can fire model \"stole\" the outfit to keep partying and walked the walk of shame in it (that's how they referenced it, and given the unprofessional aspect, I figure the misogynist term kind of fits). Naturally, parts of it were ripped, and there was a lot of tension if Klum and the judges would validate the public's vote because the dress they were seeing didn't match what the public had seen...\n\nThe designer Jay and several other designers said stuff like that happens all the time, especially backstage to a runway where everything is chaos... so no one tattled, but several of them refused to work with that model again!", "u/PreferenceNew3679 is a bot.", "oh no, feeling bad about your bratty conduct?!\n\nyou're so right I *totally* take it back", "She is an 18 year old posting on Instagram.", "So true! Dresses can feel like pyjamas, in comfortable level, but you'd still look more dressed up than in most pants...", "It has mother of the bride vibes. It was definitely appropriate for a party. Her cousin is just having a lot of feelings her brain is not developed enough to process with proper perspective", "What are you on about? OP already said she was afraid this would happen so she tried her best to stay in the corner near one of the older relatives and make herself invisible basically. What reality check do you expect for this girl when she already did her best in a shitty situation?\n\nI was 16 once, too. A little emotional maturity is not a big ask for someone at that age. Let\u2019s stop infantilizing teenagers of that age. Sounds like the sixteen y.o. in this story is the one who needs the reality check.\n\nFor someone with \u2018decades of experience,\u2019 you are giving pretty stupid advice.\n\nNTA", "Ok I see it. I would call that formal west for sure. It\u2019s a lace top and a long chiffon skirt. It\u2019s not like a sexy red carpet gown, but I would still call that evening or formal wear. \n\nOr maybe I\u2019m just tired of these humble brags about how \u201cI\u2019m a model and I can\u2019t help taking all the attention. Am I wrong for being so beautiful?\u201d BS. \n\nI used to model too long ago. And if someone stole my clothes I\u2019d stop at Target rather than overdress to that extent. Also, I don\u2019t believe the whole story. She doesn\u2019t even have a pic of the actual dress? Like no one at the party, while gushing over how pretty she looked, took a pic of this \u201cmodel?\u201d", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Did you even read it? She\u2019s not posting. She\u2019s being *hired* to be part of *photo shoots* of her friends *designer works*", "My advice was measured and sound, you may not like it and that's fine you are allowed your opinion.", "It also sounds off to me that the friend was plus sized (with the implication that OP is not plus sized), so how would she fit into OP\u2019s sundress?", "Absolutely!", "Perhaps she could also wallow in a puddle of oil a bit, to take it one more notch down?", "Right? And so much more comfortable. Every time I get complimented in a dress I\u2019m like \u201cthanks I ate nachos last night and my jeans feel like flesh prisons.\u201d", "I\u2019m American and this isn\u2019t a rule I ever learned or have heard anyone abide by.", "What is awkward about that?\n\n\"Thank you, it is really very kind of you, I am flattered! (CHange subject to Maria or anything else).\n\nI mean, does anybody expects people gushing about you more than just that one compliment or maybe two? I find it most natural to thank for the compliment and move on. This is what you do all the time, and where is the awkwardness?", "I saw the picture and it is just a normal dress. I would not think twice about it.", "It is insane to want the entire party, i.e. several HOURS, to be just about the one person. The guests usually mingle and talk among themselves about various things, at least in my parties. I would never think of them \"stealing my light\", and while I of course want some attention, I do not expect the spotlight being on me all the time, that would be pretty exhausting.", "yes.. because thats what OP literally said happened", "No, with all due respect, I do not read it like that.\n\nShe said they kept coming to her and complimented her, but she did NOT say they stopped talking to the birthday girl.\n\nI can imagine very well that some people came to talk to OP, other people talked to the birthday girl, and some talked between them. I cannot wrap my head around how it could even be possible to have the spotlight on the honoree during the entire evening. Do you not mingle during your celebrations and talk to other people than the honoree?"]}
