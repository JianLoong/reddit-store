My younger son has always come home for Christmas.\n\nMy other son lives overseas with his wife. They didn't fly home because it was too far. Before, they would switch off Christmas between my home and my DIL's mother.\n\nThis fall my DIL lost her mom. She had come home last year to spend Christmas with her mother and had driven up to visit my younger son and me, but it was weird to see just her and not my son, and my younger son said that to me where she overheard it when she was leaving and was very upset, but he didn't mean it in a bad way, just that it was weird.\n\nThis year, my older son and his wife have moved back 5 hours away. But they recently told me they don't want to drive down for Christmas Eve because it will be too hard for them and they intend to only come Christmas day for dinner, stay two nights, then leave. \n\nWhen they told me this, I didn't know what to say and I told them I was disappointed and asked why they didn't want to be there Christmas Eve. They both came at me with anger and contempt about how they didn't want to be around a big group of people but it would only be me, my boyfriend, my younger son and his girlfriend. They met my boyfriend and my younger son's girlfriend this past summer when they moved back so they're not strangers. \n\nMy son said they don't have the \"emotional bandwidth to deal with performing and navigating the personal issues that come up in the group dynamic.\" \n\nThey said they didn't want to have to pretend to be happy and feel bad about not feeling cheerful, and gave me an ultimatum about how if I didn't understand then they wouldn't come and just my son would come up alone for a visit after Christmas but he wasn't leaving his wife alone on Christmas Eve and day. \n\nI don't understand why they wouldn't want to be around family and friends and why they feel like my home is not a safe place for them. I set up a room for them and even told them they can eat breakfast and dinner alone in their room if that's what they need. \n\nMy DIL said she didn't want to feel like she had to hide away to feel safe and that she knew she would need to cry at times like on Christmas morning and she didn't want to cry in front of people or feel like she was bringing down other people's happiness. I told her we all understand so it's fine.\n\nI couldn't handle having this conversation over email and they could have called me to talk to me about this so I bowed out. My DIL said she understood and that there were pros and cons to both phone calls and written messages but that it was important that we all talk about our feelings. But when I spoke from the heart I got ultimatums and how is me being upset and disappointed about them choosing not to spend Christmas with me so hard to understand? AITA?", "created_utc": 1670166769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcc5vm/aita_because_i_want_my_son_and_dil_to_spend/", "score": 494, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is clearly a case of \u201cMissing Missing Reasons.\u201d They have *told* you why they\u2019d rather not come; you\u2019re just not accepting their choices. That\u2019s on you. You can either enjoy their company for Christmas Dinner PLUS another two nights\u2026or you can safely assume they won\u2019t come at all.

Accept their choices with grace, or risk not seeing them at all next year.", ">My son said they don't have the \"emotional bandwidth to deal with performing and navigating the personal issues that come up in the group dynamic.\"\n\nThis right here explains why they do not want to participate in the festivities so many days around Christmas. You should respect their boundaries. \n\nThis isn't about you OP. DIL is having a hard time. I'm sure this is first Christmas without her parent and I'm sure she is devastated. Everyone grieves differently, you need to respect that too. \n\nThey have compromised by promising to come a few days, which I'm sure it's stressful enough for them.  Why is that not enough for you? \n\nYTA", "Just to clarify, your eldest son and DIL were going to come to you for Christmas Day but just not Christmas Eve as well? If so i'm struggling to see the problem you're having here.  Also I think there's some important info missing about why they feel uncomfortable in your home.  You're not an AH for wanting to see your family for Christmas but you would be one for not being willing to compromise so that everyone feels OK with the arrangements.  If your children are offering you compromises and you're rejecting them then YTA.", "YTA. Despite telling them otherwise, you clearly DON'T understand. They want to privately grieve in their own home on Christmas morning because it will be a difficult time. That's it. Fresh grief during the holiday season is a whole other beast. \n\nStop pushing them to do things your way. It's selfish beyond belief. Learn boundaries before your son ends up deciding they won't spend ANY part of the holiday with you.", "This is the first Christmas your DIL will be having since her mother passed. Holidays can be extremely difficult when you've lost someone - especially the FIRST holiday after losing someone. \n\nI would not want to have to feel like I'm putting on some performative happy face when all I want to do is cry. And I would HATE To just sit and cry in front of someone else's family and bring the mood down.  I think they were being more than generous by offering to come Christmas and spend two days.", "> it was weird to see just her and not my son, and my younger son said that to me **where she overheard it**\n\n> I don\u2019t understand why [\u2026] they don\u2019t feel it a safe place for them\n\nNot very bright are you? YTA", "I think you should assume that there are good reasons for their decision and practice accepting what they have said graciously.  \n\nThey've agreed to come down on Christmas and stay two nights, that's pretty major, IMO.  \n\nSorry, YTA for pushing back here.", "\"This fall my DIL lost her mom.\"\n\nThat means no more than 3 months ago, your DIL lost her mother. It could be more recent. Either way, she is grieving and this is her first Christmas without her mother.\n\nShe and your son should do whatever it is that helps her get through a very difficult time. You should be glad their plans include you at all rather than fussing over Christmas Eve.\n\nIt sounds as if some piece of you thought, \"Well, with her mother gone, I get all the Christmases!\" Which is kind of ugly.", "YTA and self centered. Your son and DIL were coming for Christmas \u2014 like you wanted \u2014 but no, that's not enough. So you pushed and pushed trying to get your way, and just succeeded in making an awful holiday season worse for them. Congratulations. You'll be lucky if they come at all now.", "YTA:  you don\u2019t seem to have put much thought into how your son and DIL might feel right now. Holidays are hard for people who lose a family member, especially a mother. And then here\u2019s you! A mom. One that\u2019s alive and caring for her family at a holiday, something your DIL will never experience with her mother again. \n\nAlso consider how you talk about her in this thread. You blame her for stuff that isn\u2019t her decision and you\u2019ve been very dismissive of her as a person. \n\nYou may want to reflect on HOW you enagage with her and what message that sends about her place in the family - assuming you\u2019d like to see your son at some point.", "YTA\n\nHer mother died and your son, he husband is supporting her decision for what she NEEDS this year.\n\nAlso, she is probably incomfortable overhearing that it was weird she was there; she went out of her way to visit you during a difficult time in her life. Your son is an adult, he could wait until she left to mention it was weird?  \n\nStop pushing your wants and let them do Christmas how they want.\n\nAlso, ab apology could go a long way. \u201cDIL\u201d sorry you overheard by BIL said and I agreed about, he was just saying it was weird that your were there without son and with you living away and we haven\u2019t seen you as often. We hope to see you with son or by yourself in the years to come\u201d. If she accepts the apology, leave it alone and give her time. That is if you are sorry.", "YTA they are coming for a the holiday and you get to see your son. Why are you being so pushy?", "This certainly sounds like a situation where DIL and your son are in defensive mode around you.  Moving home 5 hours away from you could be for various reasons, but it doesn't indicate that being close to you is a high priority.  Your DIL overhearing comments about her filial gesture of visiting you being \"weird\" certainly doesn't suggest things are great between her and your family.  And her wanting to keep the communication via email suggests that the conversation between you has been overheated in the past, or that there's been a dispute about what was said.  \n\nIt doesn't sound to me like anything your DIL/son are doing is offensive, but rather a sensible reaction to behavior and treatment they find problematic.  You may not be TAH, but we only have your perspective to go on, and I'd guess there's more to this story.  Something about you or the environment you've created makes them feel unsafe.  Whether you choose to focus on yourself and your feelings, or  figuring out what is making them feel unsafe - and then doing something about it, is up to you.", "They understand perfectly well that you are refusing to respect them and not make a non issue into a whole circus act, but here you are making something that is mostly not about you completely about you. They are adults and free to handle Christmas how they see fit. This year is means keeping Christmas eve and part of the day for themselves and their grief. However with the way you are acting next year it might be not doing a damn thing with you \n\nI can also see why they went the email route. Not only is there no mistakes in what was said and how but also provides a record of what exactly was said and in this case a record of you refusing to accept how they want to do things.\n\nYTA. Christmas isn't about just what you want.", "YTA They are spending the day and two additional nights with you and that\u2019s not good enough? Last year your daughter in law, who you admit in other comments you\u2019ve had issues with in the past, drove to see you without your son, and you said that was weird. Your son and daughter in law can\u2019t win with you. Don\u2019t be shocked when they stop coming at all. My mother pushed and pushed me all of my life, nothing was ever good enough. Christmas was ruined for me with her demands that it be celebrated exactly how she wanted. Now I don\u2019t see her at Christmas at all. She pushed too hard. If you don\u2019t want your son to completely pull back, stop demanding and start listening to their needs, not just your wants.", "YTA. What is it with in-laws not understanding that their children\u2019s spouses ALSO HAVE PARENTS. My MIL was so cruel to me about my father\u2019s death, so maybe I\u2019m biased, but I just don\u2019t understand why you think she should snap her fingers and immediately be over the death of her mother. Is that what you\u2019d want your children to do? Just forget you and not grieve or mourn? This is her first Christmas without her MOM. You\u2019re lucky they\u2019re coming at all after she heard you guys talking shit last year. It\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d she came to visit you?? She went out of her way to come see you when her mom was dying and you call her \u201cweird.\u201d She\u2019s actually a saint for still spending any of the holiday with you. Get over yourself.", "You're such an asshole. Your get together is not more important than DIL grief. \n\nYou are absolutely bulldozing your son and his wife and refusing to listen to their needs because you don't understand why they don't want to be around you? Maybe your relentlessness about them spending their time and energy they way you want despite them PRECISELY explaining why they won't be present - makes you an asshole and an egomaniac. \n\nYou're basically saying \"her dead mom shouldn't stop them from enjoying Christmas with me!\"\n\n\nIt's almost like now that her mom died you don't have any Christmas competition and you feel entitled to have them over because you don't have to share them with DILs family anymore.", "YTA. First of all, they ARE spending Christmas with you- just not all 24 hours. Second of all, this is your DIL\u2019s first Christmas without her mom, and she deserves to be able to grieve in the manner that she wishes- and that doesn\u2019t include being locked away in a guest room in a home that\u2019s not hers. You don\u2019t have to understand why she\u2019s uncomfortable. You just have to accept their decision and stop trying to push for more. Oh, and you couldn\u2019t handle having this conversation over email\u2026.. but you expect your DIL to handle much more difficult emotions in front of your family or locked in a guest room? You\u2019re incredibly selfish all around. Oh and again, THEY DID CHOOSE TO SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH YOU. You\u2019re the one making it more difficult than it needs to be. Your wants are not more important than your DIL\u2019s emotional needs. You are only going to drive them away if you keep this up.\n\nETA: your other son called her weird because she took time out of her visit to her own mother and made an effort to visit you guys? And yet you don\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t feel safe in your home? Wow. She did something incredibly nice. Yet she was insulted for doing so. I wouldn\u2019t want to go be vulnerable in your home either.", "YTA.  People like you are why I hate Christmas.  It is not a jolly fun holiday for everyone.  It is, in fact, stressful, angst inducing and painful for many.  Dealing with toxic family members, unrealistic expectations, etc., etc.  Your son and DIL are grieving and don't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with all of the above. \n\nYou are coming across as a demanding harpy.  They have declined the invitation, stop with the guilt trip and manipulation.", "Yta. This is all about you. You don\u2019t care about their grief, just the (very very very mild) inconvenience to you. They were planning on staying with you for 2 days but that\u2019s not good enough cause they aren\u2019t showing up Christmas Eve?", "YTA-It\u2019s not all about you. They\u2019ve given you a reasonable compromise. They\u2019ve explained why your desires won\u2019t line up with theirs. You need  to respect that and stop pushing.", "Your DIL just lost her mum. Saying she passed in the fall doesn't make the time line greater. Its recent. She is grieving and hurting, and you want her to be there, slap on a fake smile and act like a performing seal?\n\nWhere is your empathy and compassion?\n\nYour son wants to be with HIS family, his WIFE on what will be a very hard Christmas for her. Not having to excuse themselves to the guest room when feeling overwhelmed. Meeting someone once does make them a stranger still BTW. \n\nYour throwing a tantrum cos they won't give you what you want, over what your DIL needs.

They're still spending time with you during the holiday. You're acting like it's some mortal sin that they're not devoting their entire time to you. Also, your DIL is grieving her own mom. Have some compassion.", "YTA. Sounds like those issues you think were resolved probably are not. \n\nThey are coming to see you, just not on the date you have decided is a hill to die on, rather than just being grateful they are coming at all. You know what your behavior will get you?\n\nThe same thing it got my MIL. No holidays at all.", "YTA. This was my third Thanksgiving since my mother\u2019s passing and I woke up crying the day before Thanksgiving because I just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of playing happy for the holiday. I let my cousin know I wasn\u2019t going to join them this year and promptly received loving messages and phone calls from my other family members. Be thankful if they come at all and try to find some friggin\u2019 empathy for your DIL\u2019s devastating loss.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary for you to understand - you just need to accept that they may need something different than what you want.\n\nSo, instead of asking why or trying to make them explain to you - call and say this:\n\n\u201c*I will be happy to see you Christmas Day. I am sorry that this will be difficult for DIL. If there\u2019s anything I can do or not do that would help, please let me know.*\u201d", "YTA. They're going to spend several nights with you.

Way to paint yourself as a victim.", "YTA\n\nI'm somewhat not surprised they don't consider your home a safe space. I strongly recommend for you to try to understand why is that, it would greatly improve your relationship with them.", "YTA - you are being selfish only thinking about your wants.   They are compromising with you and are planning on visiting Christmas Day, but that isn\u2019t good enough for you.  You want more.  Keep this up and they will cancel the visit completely.", "YTA\n\nYour DIL is experiencing her first holiday without her mother.  She will be SAD and the first holiday is always the worst.\n\nYou and your younger son made her feel uncomfortable last year.\n\nYou don't understand why she does not feel safe there?  Being a bit obtuse are we?\n\nI think they are being quite generous coming for the time they stated.  \n\nIf this is really such an imposition, uninvite them.  They can then spend the time at home and  navigate a trying holiday in peace.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t even know you but this made me emotionally exhausted. I couldn\u2019t imagine dealing with this on a holiday while I\u2019m grieving my own mother. \n\nGrow up. Pressuring them into thinking your house is a safe place is exactly why your house isn\u2019t a safe place. This post is all about how you feel. Don\u2019t worry that you son and dil have lost someone important to them because youre worried about your Christmas", "So you want someone you find it weird to spend time with when your sons not there. You are both aware that you feel it\u2019s weird but you want her to show up to your home and be vulnerable in her time of grief. YTA a very entitled one at that. Careful how you behave from here on out because while you suck you at least seemed to have raised one son right and I think he will choose his wife.", "YTA. Speaking as a son whose mother behaved this way about holidays: just cut it out. \n\nThey\u2019re in their 30s. They\u2019re grown adults. They\u2019re not obligated to visit you on a Christmas AT ALL.\n\nSeriously, if they just called up and said \u201cwe don\u2019t feel like it\u201d that would be enough. They don\u2019t need an excuse or a reason. Even without grief or a death in the family, they have every right to spend Christmas alone.\n\nYou got your kids at Christmas when they were children. You don\u2019t get them forever. Let it go.\n\nOr you can be like my Mother and never have your son in your house on a holiday again. It\u2019s been 15 years+ since I spent a Christmas under her roof. Stop the childish entitlement.", "YTA. They *are* spending Christmas with you, just not Christmas Eve or Christmas morning. Regardless of whether your DIL is in mourning or not (and that is a big deal), they\u2019re a family now and get to spend the holidays as they choose. You can feel disappointed, sure, but you really should learn to keep those feelings to yourself. Arguing with them about their decision is a sure-fire way to ensure they visit less frequently.\n\nAs well, they\u2019re giving you a large chunk of time. Christmas Day plus the two following nights is pretty generous, especially since DIL has her own grieving family who would undoubtedly love to see her. Count your blessings already.", "YTA You don't understand that your kid hurt DILs feelings last year and that this year DIL is going to face multiple triggers about last year being her last with her mother?  Don't be surprised if DIL never sees you again.", "YTA  They did plan on spending Christmas with you... and 2 more days after that. They just didn't want to come up on Christmas Eve and you chose to harangue them about it. You need to understand that this is her 1st christmas without her mother and it's not up to you to decide how they should handle that.", "They are grieving and you are somehow making it all about you. Of course YTA. Maybe when your mom died you were fine hanging around people on holidays but THEY. ARE. NOT. YOU. Everyone grieves differently and if you can't accept that gracefully then I expect you are going to be seeing them even less.", "Huge YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re going to alienate them to the point that they cut down to driving for dinner and then leaving instead of staying for any number of nights, and then tapering off to nothing. That happened with my dad and my grandparents; it was their way or the highway, so he chose the highway. It also happened with my husband and his parents. He\u2019s spent one major holiday with them in the 30+ years we\u2019ve been married because they couldn\u2019t understand that we\u2019re not children and they didn\u2019t get to control our decisions.\n\nIf you want to avoid that, apologize sincerely, tell them to do what they need to do for themselves this year, and then back off.

Your boyfriends family wants you to be with them on Christmas Eve. But you want to stay home to grieve. Cause you feel safe there. And just because it\u2019s your home. Would there be any force or any argument in the world that could bring you out of your house that day? - YTA. Your post and your comments read like you think you have more right to your son than his wife.", "YTA, it's the poor woman's first Christmas without her mom. She's bound to have a lot of emotions this Christmas and both have stated they don't have the capacity to deal with being social. You continue to argue about it, they're giving you ultimatum because you aren't respecting their boundary.  Not to mention the previous year when she did come up you guys were whispering behind her back about how weird it was she came up to see you without your son.  Why would they want to deal with people that make her feel awkward like that.", "YTA My Mom died in September 2020 (Labor Day weekend) and the Christmas afterwards was very sad and there were many tears shed. Your DIL wanted a safe place to grieve and didn't want to come Christmas Eve because you couldn't offer it to her. I don't blame her. You and your youngest son made her feel like not a part of the family last year. It may have been unintentional but that comment your son made hurt her. Holidays are not the same after you lose a close family member. Especially a parent or sibling. It is just too raw for her right now and you need to respect her decision of not wanting to be around ILs who don't think of her as family while she is vulnerable. Who wants to be locked up in a room crying while everyone is laughing out in the living room? All the time she will be there, she will be thinking that this woman (you) will never love me like my Mom did, which will make her more sad about her Mom not being there. You have a lot of work to do to mend this relationship or you may not have the best one with her or any grandchildren.", "YTA. \n\nSo first, they are telling you they don't feel comfortable with a group/grieving at your home. It doesn't matter that YOU think they should feel comfortable, the reality is that they do not. They are communicating that clearly and politely, and you don't get to decide that their feelings aren't valid. \n\nSecond, they are spending Christmas with you and staying for a few days! That's great! But instead of being happy you have family, and they want to spend Christmas with you, you are making them miserable and unlikely to come at all, because you MUST have Christmas Eve too. \n\nThird, you and your son made your DIL uncomfortable on her last visit, when she went out of her way to come and visit, and yet you can't fathom why she doesn't feel fully comfortable in your home. That is a situation you created. \n\nAnd finally, at ever turn, you have said \"you understand\" but also completely diminish their very rational emotions. I do not want to be around people I don't know well when I am grieving, and I want to be in a comfortable, familiar space. Your boyfriend and son's girlfriend are not well known by your DIL and son, just because they have met doesn't make them close. Your DIL wants to feel free to grieve and hiding in a guest room doesn't sound super fun, and she is also clearly aware she isn't sure how she will be feeling, so wants to limit her interactions, which is totally valid. Just because YOU feel comfortable and think her crying in front of you is fine, she doesn't feel that way, and it is remarkable that you have no ability to acknowledge that your way isn't the only way. \n\nOh, and let's add that you and your son said it was WEIRD when she visited, but also expect her to now be 100% comfortable in your home. \n\nThey are coming on Christmas day and staying, and you would rather fight them on that and have them not come at all?", "Today is 21 years since the death of my mother, so I'm probably a little emotional, but WTAF is wrong with you?\n\nYour DIL LOST HER MOTHER. This is her first Christmas without her. I was a bawling mess that year. If I hadn't had children I would have been in a curled up ball in a very dark room. No way would I have ventured out to spend time with my husband's family.\n\nYou ARE getting to spend time with both of your sons for Christmas. They are just compromising on when. As for WHY, since you can't seem to fathom up any compassion for your DIL's grief, maybe look at this post and see how demanding and overbearing you are being. I wouldn't want to spend a holiday with you either. \n\nStop thinking about your self. Develop some compassion, or see a therapist.

You are not content with them coming on Christmas and having a couple days with you. The problem is not so much that you wish for more time, it is that you believe you are entitled to more time and so find yourself bewildered when the game pieces do not move the way you please.

This means you did your job raising them and they are functioning adults. It's past time to back off.\n\nYou are not the center of their universe and you seem unable to accept that.", "YTA.

They tried to spend Christmas with you, but you didn't accept them coming for dinner.\n\nEDIT: They're coming for dinner and staying TWO DAYS! They clearly value time with you and you're driving them away because your DIL doesn't want to wake up at your house the first Christmas after her own mother has passed! It makes me want to delete this whole thing, throw my phone against the wall, and assume someone else gave a better response. \n****************** \n\n You've refused to listen to their honest reasons and needs and offered up accommodations that work for YOU, refusing to accept what works for THEM.\n\nYour behavior is going to cause them to cut contact and then you will put the blame on them. \n\nIt seems you have a lot of hurt inside about your oldest son. Consider speaking with a counselor about it to better be able to understand and express it. It sounds like they have set healthy boundaries for themselves, and unfortunately that sometimes hurts the people we love. But it isn't out of spite. It's the proper way to take care of your own mental health.", "YTA. You don't need to understand how or why people feel the way they do you just need to respect it.

You are making this all about you, when it's absolutely not. Think about it: would you feel as comfy/at home in their house as you do your own? Would you feel comfortable grieving a lost child or spouse in their house? I truly doubt this will be a case of \"let me quickly cry and then I'll feel better.\" \n\nI adore my parents, but their home is not my home. They don't have my cats, my mattress, my pillows, my comfy couch, my coffee maker, my TV setup - all the things I've built to my tastes and preferences. When I'm at their home, I feel like a guest. I follow their rules. I eat their food. I have to socialize with my mom's bf and his guests, who I've known for years, but as an introvert-leaning person does not feel like family to me, and thus requires a huge amount of social energy. \n\nAnd on top of this - you have expressed to the gf that she is not 100% welcome there, and that she alone does not belong there.

They need time on Christmas morning? Great. Looking forward to seeing you for dinner. How about asking if there were any traditions or favourite foods that remind her of her mom that you could provide that night, if it would feel comforting to her? How about asking her if she wants to include any memory about her mom in the way you celebrate that evening?\n\nSeriously. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d her, why she needs what she needs, or why your son is prioritizing those needs. It\u2019s called empathy.

At least show some compassion and stop making it all about you.\n\nEdited to add: if this is how you respond to this compromise it explains a lot about what your son meant about \u201cperforming and navigating the personal issues\u201d.

Also, looking at how you've interacted with them at far, what's happened is that they've expressed how they feel and drawn their boundaries, and instead of listening, you've argued/dismissed at every turn. Instead of accepting this is how they feel and what they need, you question why, and when they explain, you make it clear that according to you their reasons aren't valid or good enough.

They both came at me with anger and contempt about how they didn't want to be around a big group of people but it would only be me, my boyfriend, my younger son and his girlfriend. They met my boyfriend and my younger son's girlfriend this past summer when they moved back so they're not strangers. \n\nMy son said they don't have the \"emotional bandwidth to deal with performing and navigating the personal issues that come up in the group dynamic.\" \n\nThey said they didn't want to have to pretend to be happy and feel bad about not feeling cheerful, and gave me an ultimatum about how if I didn't understand then they wouldn't come and just my son would come up alone for a visit after Christmas but he wasn't leaving his wife alone on Christmas Eve and day. \n\nI don't understand why they wouldn't want to be around family and friends and why they feel like my home is not a safe place for them. I set up a room for them and even told them they can eat breakfast and dinner alone in their room if that's what they need. \n\nMy DIL said she didn't want to feel like she had to hide away to feel safe and that she knew she would need to cry at times like on Christmas morning and she didn't want to cry in front of people or feel like she was bringing down other people's happiness. I told her we all understand so it's fine.\n\nI couldn't handle having this conversation over email and they could have called me to talk to me about this so I bowed out. My DIL said she understood and that there were pros and cons to both phone calls and written messages but that it was important that we all talk about our feelings. But when I spoke from the heart I got ultimatums and how is me being upset and disappointed about them choosing not to spend Christmas with me so hard to understand?

Christmas dinner will likely also be tough for her, but she\u2019s trying here; I think you aren\u2019t able to see it because it doesn\u2019t fit what you want, so you\u2019re disregarding their efforts.  Your DIL would likely much prefer to stay home all day on Christmas as part of her grieving, but is extending this offer out of kindness and love for her husband and you.\n\nI realize what they are offering isn\u2019t everything you want and that having your sons together with you on Christmas is important to you.  So do they.  That\u2019s why they are planning to come over for Christmas dinner despite the fact that it will be a really difficult day for your DIL.  \n\nIt is disingenuous that you are pretending your place is a \u201csafe space\u201d for them.  Last year, you and your other son made it clear that her being there without her husband was weird; she doesn\u2019t really belong there.  When she tried to explain that she was overwhelmed by a family party earlier in the year, you behaved poorly.  If you want to become a safe place for her, you\u2019ll need to act like one.  \n\nI don\u2019t think you see how close you are to permanently fracturing these relationships.  When someone keeps trying to meet you halfway and you keep rejecting their efforts, they will stop trying.  This doesn\u2019t end where you think it does with them just doing exactly what you want.  They just realize you\u2019ll never be happy and do exactly what they would prefer to do.\n\nIf you want to salvage the relationship and give it a future, you\u2019ll tell them that you appreciate how difficult that time will be for them, want to give them the space they need to grieve and are grateful that you\u2019ll have them with you for Christmas dinner and look forward to spending time with them and apologize for making your preferences take center stage at a difficult time for them.  Recognize that what they are offering is the best they can offer and appreciate it.\n\nOr, dig your heels in, insist she\u2019s grieving wrong, insist that you\u2019ll be respectful despite her previous experience to the contrary, and see how that goes.

Your family insulted your DIL and called her weird when she did go out of her way to visit you \n\n2.

It's not automatically a judgement of your family not being good enough for her. This is her asking for a social break. Maybe she had already been intetacting with a lot of people that day. It takes social stamina to interact with people, even when they are people she genuinely likes. \n\nIf she really does have  a problem intetacting with your family as you say, then I agree with the other commentor that replied to your comment here. If your family is the type that expects her to be constantly engaged without any break when you're together, that's going to be exhausting for anyone.

She sounds like an introvert, and there are many times we get \u201cpeopled out.\u201d It\u2019s not insulting. It\u2019s who we are. \n\nYou sound like an exhausting MIL. I wouldn\u2019t be coming by for any holidays or family stuff for a good long while.", "You need to educate yourself about what introversion is and how introverts react to social situations and what their coping mechanisms are. This is hard for people who are extroverts to understand, but you are actively making the situation worse by viewing her as awkward and getting offended by her need to be alone to recharge. \n\nYTA. Big time. You can\u2019t get out of your own way to see things from the pov of someone who is both different from you, and grieving from a huge loss. She has taken huge steps to compromise and you can\u2019t even see it. \n\nIf you care about your relationship with your son you need to do some work on yourself and fast.", "I do almost all of my appointment scheduling exclusively via email for the exact same reason! Someone can tell me that I have an appointment at 2pm on Monday and the second I hang up the phone I'm like....... shit when was that again?", "AND finding reasons to blame her DIL for it.", "Do you make it awkward? I bet you do. She\u2019s likely tried hard to please you and to fit in. Ffs the woman came to visit you when her own mother was dying so she\u2019s clearly trying. Sounds like no matter what she does is wrong or not enough for you.\n\nThey\u2019re not obligated to spend any of Christmas with you and the fact that they\u2019re willing to give you 3 days despite your obvious issues surrounding your DiL speaks volumes about their character.\n\nDo better as you are 100% TA.\n\nEdit: meant her mom not yours.", "And this is exactly why she doesn\u2019t want to be around you during her time dealing with grief. You keep saying your home is a safe space for them to grieve when it\u2019s obviously not.", "You sound exhausting.", "You have made that obvious to her and your son.  Why would she want to subject herself to the kind of environment that makes her uncomfortable just to make you happy especially when you show no compassion for her in her time of grief.  You sound like an entitled MIL who has no empathy for your DIL and son has rightly put her needs before yours as it should be. You madam are not the center of the universe.", "Oh I wonder why? /s\n\n\nIt couldn't be the fact that she made an effort to see you over Christmas and both you and your other son, decided to crap on it. That could be one reason for it.", "You're a tiring person and you are creating problems to he upset about. The holidays are not about you and your feelings and you should know that as an adult. Settle down. YTA.\n\nNothing is good enough for you. You are ruining the holidays for your own family and blaming your children. Stop.", "No shit she's awkward. You don't sound like a good person to be around.", "Yes, you do, and she knows it. You\u2019re not even able to hide it from all of us here, do you think you\u2019ve been hiding it from her?", "You call her awkward when she's not dealing with grief so why the fuck would she want to be around you for the first Christmas without her mother for you to judge how she's grieving? Just drop it already.", "Well, you seem to refuse to accept her as she is, so yeah, that would make things awkward. \n\nYTA.", "Yes, because of your openly inhospitable behavior", "ONCE AGAIN - you call her awkward, say you don't have a lot in common, had issues in the past and doesn't fit in. WHY in the world would she think your home is a safe space?!", "Is your boomer brain completly rotten or are you really that delusional?", "You\u2019re very strange and difficult and demanding. I\u2019d be awkward around you too. \n\nYTA.", "When you said it it was weird that she was visiting you without your son, you made it awkward. Who says that!?", "She came because her mother was sick and you and your son were talking about how \u201cweird\u201d it was for her to visit you??? You\u2019re definitely an asshole.", "So instead of being happy that your DIL stopped by after visiting her dying mother, you and your other son were talking about how \u2018weird\u2019 it was. And now you wonder, since she has lost her mom, why they don\u2019t want to come to your house? They\u2019re coming for Christmas dinner and staying two more days! But you want to pick a fight about Christmas Eve? \n\nThis all sounds very selfish, OP. YTA", "If you want her to consider your family her family, why on earth are you allowing your other son to say that it's weird that she's there alone? My in-laws would NEVER think it's weird that I was there without my husband and we live across the country.", "Okay well hindsight is always 20/20. Lol. I'm assuming it's a family tradition to do this, so it's not unreasonable to assume it would be followed again. She's reaching out for advice. She's not evil.", "I'm not even an introvert and I still get \"peopled out\" sometimes.", "Horribly offensive -they're clearly narwhals.", "Bingo", "Same with my MIL. She\u2019s a really nice lady but she is so extroverted and so talkative and so needy of attention and conversation\u2026 I get overwhelmed after being around her for even an hour.", "Her and my son are both introverts and I get that.", "I love that my medical clinic immediately auto sends an email with appointment details, no matter how I make the appointment. Also they send a text for online check-in a couple days in advance that includes appointment date and time.", "Absolutely, I didn\u2019t mean to imply otherwise.  \n\nOften, I am peopled out without leaving my house except to do the school runs. I find groups exhausting. The thought of having to spend time around people who may be complete assholes or racist or rude or just annoying? I\u2019m not even going. I always encouraged my ex to go and have a great time but I gave myself permission to stay home (not that it went over well with the ex.)", "I can see that from way over here.", "Oh yeah I knew you weren't, I was just adding extra context for OP :)", "Good call - seems like she needs it."]}
