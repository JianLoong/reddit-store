My younger son has always come home for Christmas.\n\nMy other son lives overseas with his wife. They didn't fly home because it was too far. Before, they would switch off Christmas between my home and my DIL's mother.\n\nThis fall my DIL lost her mom. She had come home last year to spend Christmas with her mother and had driven up to visit my younger son and me, but it was weird to see just her and not my son, and my younger son said that to me where she overheard it when she was leaving and was very upset, but he didn't mean it in a bad way, just that it was weird.\n\nThis year, my older son and his wife have moved back 5 hours away. But they recently told me they don't want to drive down for Christmas Eve because it will be too hard for them and they intend to only come Christmas day for dinner, stay two nights, then leave. \n\nWhen they told me this, I didn't know what to say and I told them I was disappointed and asked why they didn't want to be there Christmas Eve. They both came at me with anger and contempt about how they didn't want to be around a big group of people but it would only be me, my boyfriend, my younger son and his girlfriend. They met my boyfriend and my younger son's girlfriend this past summer when they moved back so they're not strangers. \n\nMy son said they don't have the \"emotional bandwidth to deal with performing and navigating the personal issues that come up in the group dynamic.\" \n\nThey said they didn't want to have to pretend to be happy and feel bad about not feeling cheerful, and gave me an ultimatum about how if I didn't understand then they wouldn't come and just my son would come up alone for a visit after Christmas but he wasn't leaving his wife alone on Christmas Eve and day. \n\nI don't understand why they wouldn't want to be around family and friends and why they feel like my home is not a safe place for them. I set up a room for them and even told them they can eat breakfast and dinner alone in their room if that's what they need. \n\nMy DIL said she didn't want to feel like she had to hide away to feel safe and that she knew she would need to cry at times like on Christmas morning and she didn't want to cry in front of people or feel like she was bringing down other people's happiness. I told her we all understand so it's fine.\n\nI couldn't handle having this conversation over email and they could have called me to talk to me about this so I bowed out. My DIL said she understood and that there were pros and cons to both phone calls and written messages but that it was important that we all talk about our feelings. But when I spoke from the heart I got ultimatums and how is me being upset and disappointed about them choosing not to spend Christmas with me so hard to understand?

This is clearly a case of \u201cMissing Missing Reasons.\u201d They have *told* you why they\u2019d rather not come; you\u2019re just not accepting their choices. That\u2019s on you. You can either enjoy their company for Christmas Dinner PLUS another two nights\u2026or you can safely assume they won\u2019t come at all.

Accept their choices with grace, or risk not seeing them at all next year.", ">My son said they don't have the \"emotional bandwidth to deal with performing and navigating the personal issues that come up in the group dynamic.\"\n\nThis right here explains why they do not want to participate in the festivities so many days around Christmas. You should respect their boundaries. \n\nThis isn't about you OP. DIL is having a hard time. I'm sure this is first Christmas without her parent and I'm sure she is devastated. Everyone grieves differently, you need to respect that too. \n\nThey have compromised by promising to come a few days, which I'm sure it's stressful enough for them.  Why is that not enough for you? \n\nYTA", "Just to clarify, your eldest son and DIL were going to come to you for Christmas Day but just not Christmas Eve as well? If so i'm struggling to see the problem you're having here.  Also I think there's some important info missing about why they feel uncomfortable in your home.  You're not an AH for wanting to see your family for Christmas but you would be one for not being willing to compromise so that everyone feels OK with the arrangements.  If your children are offering you compromises and you're rejecting them then YTA.", "YTA. Despite telling them otherwise, you clearly DON'T understand. They want to privately grieve in their own home on Christmas morning because it will be a difficult time. That's it. Fresh grief during the holiday season is a whole other beast. \n\nStop pushing them to do things your way. It's selfish beyond belief. Learn boundaries before your son ends up deciding they won't spend ANY part of the holiday with you.", "This is the first Christmas your DIL will be having since her mother passed. Holidays can be extremely difficult when you've lost someone - especially the FIRST holiday after losing someone. \n\nI would not want to have to feel like I'm putting on some performative happy face when all I want to do is cry. And I would HATE To just sit and cry in front of someone else's family and bring the mood down.  I think they were being more than generous by offering to come Christmas and spend two days.", "> it was weird to see just her and not my son, and my younger son said that to me **where she overheard it**\n\n> I don\u2019t understand why [\u2026] they don\u2019t feel it a safe place for them\n\nNot very bright are you? YTA", "I think you should assume that there are good reasons for their decision and practice accepting what they have said graciously.  \n\nThey've agreed to come down on Christmas and stay two nights, that's pretty major, IMO.  \n\nSorry, YTA for pushing back here.", "\"This fall my DIL lost her mom.\"\n\nThat means no more than 3 months ago, your DIL lost her mother. It could be more recent. Either way, she is grieving and this is her first Christmas without her mother.\n\nShe and your son should do whatever it is that helps her get through a very difficult time. You should be glad their plans include you at all rather than fussing over Christmas Eve.\n\nIt sounds as if some piece of you thought, \"Well, with her mother gone, I get all the Christmases!\" Which is kind of ugly.", "YTA and self centered. Your son and DIL were coming for Christmas \u2014 like you wanted \u2014 but no, that's not enough. So you pushed and pushed trying to get your way, and just succeeded in making an awful holiday season worse for them. Congratulations. You'll be lucky if they come at all now.", "YTA:  you don\u2019t seem to have put much thought into how your son and DIL might feel right now. Holidays are hard for people who lose a family member, especially a mother. And then here\u2019s you! A mom. One that\u2019s alive and caring for her family at a holiday, something your DIL will never experience with her mother again. \n\nAlso consider how you talk about her in this thread. You blame her for stuff that isn\u2019t her decision and you\u2019ve been very dismissive of her as a person. \n\nYou may want to reflect on HOW you enagage with her and what message that sends about her place in the family - assuming you\u2019d like to see your son at some point.", "YTA\n\nHer mother died and your son, he husband is supporting her decision for what she NEEDS this year.\n\nAlso, she is probably incomfortable overhearing that it was weird she was there; she went out of her way to visit you during a difficult time in her life. Your son is an adult, he could wait until she left to mention it was weird?  \n\nStop pushing your wants and let them do Christmas how they want.\n\nAlso, ab apology could go a long way. \u201cDIL\u201d sorry you overheard by BIL said and I agreed about, he was just saying it was weird that your were there without son and with you living away and we haven\u2019t seen you as often. We hope to see you with son or by yourself in the years to come\u201d. If she accepts the apology, leave it alone and give her time. That is if you are sorry.", "YTA they are coming for a the holiday and you get to see your son. Why are you being so pushy?", "This certainly sounds like a situation where DIL and your son are in defensive mode around you.  Moving home 5 hours away from you could be for various reasons, but it doesn't indicate that being close to you is a high priority.  Your DIL overhearing comments about her filial gesture of visiting you being \"weird\" certainly doesn't suggest things are great between her and your family.  And her wanting to keep the communication via email suggests that the conversation between you has been overheated in the past, or that there's been a dispute about what was said.  \n\nIt doesn't sound to me like anything your DIL/son are doing is offensive, but rather a sensible reaction to behavior and treatment they find problematic.  You may not be TAH, but we only have your perspective to go on, and I'd guess there's more to this story.  Something about you or the environment you've created makes them feel unsafe.  Whether you choose to focus on yourself and your feelings, or  figuring out what is making them feel unsafe - and then doing something about it, is up to you.", "They understand perfectly well that you are refusing to respect them and not make a non issue into a whole circus act, but here you are making something that is mostly not about you completely about you. They are adults and free to handle Christmas how they see fit. This year is means keeping Christmas eve and part of the day for themselves and their grief. However with the way you are acting next year it might be not doing a damn thing with you \n\nI can also see why they went the email route. Not only is there no mistakes in what was said and how but also provides a record of what exactly was said and in this case a record of you refusing to accept how they want to do things.\n\nYTA. Christmas isn't about just what you want.", "YTA They are spending the day and two additional nights with you and that\u2019s not good enough? Last year your daughter in law, who you admit in other comments you\u2019ve had issues with in the past, drove to see you without your son, and you said that was weird. Your son and daughter in law can\u2019t win with you. Don\u2019t be shocked when they stop coming at all. My mother pushed and pushed me all of my life, nothing was ever good enough. Christmas was ruined for me with her demands that it be celebrated exactly how she wanted. Now I don\u2019t see her at Christmas at all. She pushed too hard. If you don\u2019t want your son to completely pull back, stop demanding and start listening to their needs, not just your wants.", "YTA. What is it with in-laws not understanding that their children\u2019s spouses ALSO HAVE PARENTS. My MIL was so cruel to me about my father\u2019s death, so maybe I\u2019m biased, but I just don\u2019t understand why you think she should snap her fingers and immediately be over the death of her mother. Is that what you\u2019d want your children to do? Just forget you and not grieve or mourn? This is her first Christmas without her MOM. You\u2019re lucky they\u2019re coming at all after she heard you guys talking shit last year. It\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d she came to visit you?? She went out of her way to come see you when her mom was dying and you call her \u201cweird.\u201d She\u2019s actually a saint for still spending any of the holiday with you. Get over yourself.", "You're such an asshole. Your get together is not more important than DIL grief. \n\nYou are absolutely bulldozing your son and his wife and refusing to listen to their needs because you don't understand why they don't want to be around you? Maybe your relentlessness about them spending their time and energy they way you want despite them PRECISELY explaining why they won't be present - makes you an asshole and an egomaniac. \n\nYou're basically saying \"her dead mom shouldn't stop them from enjoying Christmas with me!\"\n\n\nIt's almost like now that her mom died you don't have any Christmas competition and you feel entitled to have them over because you don't have to share them with DILs family anymore.", "YTA. First of all, they ARE spending Christmas with you- just not all 24 hours. Second of all, this is your DIL\u2019s first Christmas without her mom, and she deserves to be able to grieve in the manner that she wishes- and that doesn\u2019t include being locked away in a guest room in a home that\u2019s not hers. You don\u2019t have to understand why she\u2019s uncomfortable. You just have to accept their decision and stop trying to push for more. Oh, and you couldn\u2019t handle having this conversation over email\u2026.. but you expect your DIL to handle much more difficult emotions in front of your family or locked in a guest room? You\u2019re incredibly selfish all around. Oh and again, THEY DID CHOOSE TO SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH YOU. You\u2019re the one making it more difficult than it needs to be. Your wants are not more important than your DIL\u2019s emotional needs. You are only going to drive them away if you keep this up.\n\nETA: your other son called her weird because she took time out of her visit to her own mother and made an effort to visit you guys? And yet you don\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t feel safe in your home? Wow. She did something incredibly nice. Yet she was insulted for doing so. I wouldn\u2019t want to go be vulnerable in your home either.", "YTA.  People like you are why I hate Christmas.  It is not a jolly fun holiday for everyone.  It is, in fact, stressful, angst inducing and painful for many.  Dealing with toxic family members, unrealistic expectations, etc., etc.  Your son and DIL are grieving and don't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with all of the above. \n\nYou are coming across as a demanding harpy.  They have declined the invitation, stop with the guilt trip and manipulation.", "Yta. This is all about you. You don\u2019t care about their grief, just the (very very very mild) inconvenience to you. They were planning on staying with you for 2 days but that\u2019s not good enough cause they aren\u2019t showing up Christmas Eve?", "YTA-It\u2019s not all about you. They\u2019ve given you a reasonable compromise. They\u2019ve explained why your desires won\u2019t line up with theirs. You need  to respect that and stop pushing.", "Your DIL just lost her mum. Saying she passed in the fall doesn't make the time line greater. Its recent. She is grieving and hurting, and you want her to be there, slap on a fake smile and act like a performing seal?\n\nWhere is your empathy and compassion?\n\nYour son wants to be with HIS family, his WIFE on what will be a very hard Christmas for her. Not having to excuse themselves to the guest room when feeling overwhelmed. Meeting someone once does make them a stranger still BTW. \n\nYour throwing a tantrum cos they won't give you what you want, over what your DIL needs.

They're still spending time with you during the holiday. You're acting like it's some mortal sin that they're not devoting their entire time to you. Also, your DIL is grieving her own mom. Have some compassion.", "YTA. Sounds like those issues you think were resolved probably are not. \n\nThey are coming to see you, just not on the date you have decided is a hill to die on, rather than just being grateful they are coming at all. You know what your behavior will get you?\n\nThe same thing it got my MIL. No holidays at all.", "YTA. This was my third Thanksgiving since my mother\u2019s passing and I woke up crying the day before Thanksgiving because I just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of playing happy for the holiday. I let my cousin know I wasn\u2019t going to join them this year and promptly received loving messages and phone calls from my other family members. Be thankful if they come at all and try to find some friggin\u2019 empathy for your DIL\u2019s devastating loss.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary for you to understand - you just need to accept that they may need something different than what you want.\n\nSo, instead of asking why or trying to make them explain to you - call and say this:\n\n\u201c*I will be happy to see you Christmas Day. I am sorry that this will be difficult for DIL. If there\u2019s anything I can do or not do that would help, please let me know.*\u201d", "YTA. They're going to spend several nights with you.

Way to paint yourself as a victim.", "YTA\n\nI'm somewhat not surprised they don't consider your home a safe space. I strongly recommend for you to try to understand why is that, it would greatly improve your relationship with them.", "YTA - you are being selfish only thinking about your wants.   They are compromising with you and are planning on visiting Christmas Day, but that isn\u2019t good enough for you.  You want more.  Keep this up and they will cancel the visit completely.", "YTA\n\nYour DIL is experiencing her first holiday without her mother.  She will be SAD and the first holiday is always the worst.\n\nYou and your younger son made her feel uncomfortable last year.\n\nYou don't understand why she does not feel safe there?  Being a bit obtuse are we?\n\nI think they are being quite generous coming for the time they stated.  \n\nIf this is really such an imposition, uninvite them.  They can then spend the time at home and  navigate a trying holiday in peace.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t even know you but this made me emotionally exhausted. I couldn\u2019t imagine dealing with this on a holiday while I\u2019m grieving my own mother. \n\nGrow up. Pressuring them into thinking your house is a safe place is exactly why your house isn\u2019t a safe place. This post is all about how you feel. Don\u2019t worry that you son and dil have lost someone important to them because youre worried about your Christmas", "So you want someone you find it weird to spend time with when your sons not there. You are both aware that you feel it\u2019s weird but you want her to show up to your home and be vulnerable in her time of grief. YTA a very entitled one at that. Careful how you behave from here on out because while you suck you at least seemed to have raised one son right and I think he will choose his wife.", "YTA. Speaking as a son whose mother behaved this way about holidays: just cut it out. \n\nThey\u2019re in their 30s. They\u2019re grown adults. They\u2019re not obligated to visit you on a Christmas AT ALL.\n\nSeriously, if they just called up and said \u201cwe don\u2019t feel like it\u201d that would be enough. They don\u2019t need an excuse or a reason. Even without grief or a death in the family, they have every right to spend Christmas alone.\n\nYou got your kids at Christmas when they were children. You don\u2019t get them forever. Let it go.\n\nOr you can be like my Mother and never have your son in your house on a holiday again. It\u2019s been 15 years+ since I spent a Christmas under her roof. Stop the childish entitlement.", "YTA. They *are* spending Christmas with you, just not Christmas Eve or Christmas morning. Regardless of whether your DIL is in mourning or not (and that is a big deal), they\u2019re a family now and get to spend the holidays as they choose. You can feel disappointed, sure, but you really should learn to keep those feelings to yourself. Arguing with them about their decision is a sure-fire way to ensure they visit less frequently.\n\nAs well, they\u2019re giving you a large chunk of time. Christmas Day plus the two following nights is pretty generous, especially since DIL has her own grieving family who would undoubtedly love to see her. Count your blessings already.", "YTA You don't understand that your kid hurt DILs feelings last year and that this year DIL is going to face multiple triggers about last year being her last with her mother?  Don't be surprised if DIL never sees you again.", "YTA  They did plan on spending Christmas with you... and 2 more days after that. They just didn't want to come up on Christmas Eve and you chose to harangue them about it. You need to understand that this is her 1st christmas without her mother and it's not up to you to decide how they should handle that.", "They are grieving and you are somehow making it all about you. Of course YTA. Maybe when your mom died you were fine hanging around people on holidays but THEY. ARE. NOT. YOU. Everyone grieves differently and if you can't accept that gracefully then I expect you are going to be seeing them even less.", "Huge YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re going to alienate them to the point that they cut down to driving for dinner and then leaving instead of staying for any number of nights, and then tapering off to nothing. That happened with my dad and my grandparents; it was their way or the highway, so he chose the highway. It also happened with my husband and his parents. He\u2019s spent one major holiday with them in the 30+ years we\u2019ve been married because they couldn\u2019t understand that we\u2019re not children and they didn\u2019t get to control our decisions.\n\nIf you want to avoid that, apologize sincerely, tell them to do what they need to do for themselves this year, and then back off.

Your boyfriends family wants you to be with them on Christmas Eve. But you want to stay home to grieve. Cause you feel safe there. And just because it\u2019s your home. Would there be any force or any argument in the world that could bring you out of your house that day? - YTA. Your post and your comments read like you think you have more right to your son than his wife.", "YTA, it's the poor woman's first Christmas without her mom. She's bound to have a lot of emotions this Christmas and both have stated they don't have the capacity to deal with being social. You continue to argue about it, they're giving you ultimatum because you aren't respecting their boundary.  Not to mention the previous year when she did come up you guys were whispering behind her back about how weird it was she came up to see you without your son.  Why would they want to deal with people that make her feel awkward like that.", "YTA My Mom died in September 2020 (Labor Day weekend) and the Christmas afterwards was very sad and there were many tears shed. Your DIL wanted a safe place to grieve and didn't want to come Christmas Eve because you couldn't offer it to her. I don't blame her. You and your youngest son made her feel like not a part of the family last year. It may have been unintentional but that comment your son made hurt her. Holidays are not the same after you lose a close family member. Especially a parent or sibling. It is just too raw for her right now and you need to respect her decision of not wanting to be around ILs who don't think of her as family while she is vulnerable. Who wants to be locked up in a room crying while everyone is laughing out in the living room? All the time she will be there, she will be thinking that this woman (you) will never love me like my Mom did, which will make her more sad about her Mom not being there. You have a lot of work to do to mend this relationship or you may not have the best one with her or any grandchildren.", "YTA. \n\nSo first, they are telling you they don't feel comfortable with a group/grieving at your home. It doesn't matter that YOU think they should feel comfortable, the reality is that they do not. They are communicating that clearly and politely, and you don't get to decide that their feelings aren't valid. \n\nSecond, they are spending Christmas with you and staying for a few days! That's great! But instead of being happy you have family, and they want to spend Christmas with you, you are making them miserable and unlikely to come at all, because you MUST have Christmas Eve too. \n\nThird, you and your son made your DIL uncomfortable on her last visit, when she went out of her way to come and visit, and yet you can't fathom why she doesn't feel fully comfortable in your home. That is a situation you created. \n\nAnd finally, at ever turn, you have said \"you understand\" but also completely diminish their very rational emotions. I do not want to be around people I don't know well when I am grieving, and I want to be in a comfortable, familiar space. Your boyfriend and son's girlfriend are not well known by your DIL and son, just because they have met doesn't make them close. Your DIL wants to feel free to grieve and hiding in a guest room doesn't sound super fun, and she is also clearly aware she isn't sure how she will be feeling, so wants to limit her interactions, which is totally valid. Just because YOU feel comfortable and think her crying in front of you is fine, she doesn't feel that way, and it is remarkable that you have no ability to acknowledge that your way isn't the only way. \n\nOh, and let's add that you and your son said it was WEIRD when she visited, but also expect her to now be 100% comfortable in your home. \n\nThey are coming on Christmas day and staying, and you would rather fight them on that and have them not come at all?", "Today is 21 years since the death of my mother, so I'm probably a little emotional, but WTAF is wrong with you?\n\nYour DIL LOST HER MOTHER. This is her first Christmas without her. I was a bawling mess that year. If I hadn't had children I would have been in a curled up ball in a very dark room. No way would I have ventured out to spend time with my husband's family.\n\nYou ARE getting to spend time with both of your sons for Christmas. They are just compromising on when. As for WHY, since you can't seem to fathom up any compassion for your DIL's grief, maybe look at this post and see how demanding and overbearing you are being. I wouldn't want to spend a holiday with you either. \n\nStop thinking about your self. Develop some compassion, or see a therapist.

You are not content with them coming on Christmas and having a couple days with you. The problem is not so much that you wish for more time, it is that you believe you are entitled to more time and so find yourself bewildered when the game pieces do not move the way you please.

They clearly value time with you and you're driving them away because your DIL doesn't want to wake up at your house the first Christmas after her own mother has passed! It makes me want to delete this whole thing, throw my phone against the wall, and assume someone else gave a better response. \n****************** \n\n You've refused to listen to their honest reasons and needs and offered up accommodations that work for YOU, refusing to accept what works for THEM.\n\nYour behavior is going to cause them to cut contact and then you will put the blame on them. \n\nIt seems you have a lot of hurt inside about your oldest son. Consider speaking with a counselor about it to better be able to understand and express it.

I hope the responses on here are a wake up call that you are alienating your son and DIL at a time where your DIL is mourning one of the most important people in her life.

Would you feel comfortable grieving a lost child or spouse in their house? I truly doubt this will be a case of \"let me quickly cry and then I'll feel better.\" \n\nI adore my parents, but their home is not my home. They don't have my cats, my mattress, my pillows, my comfy couch, my coffee maker, my TV setup - all the things I've built to my tastes and preferences. When I'm at their home, I feel like a guest. I follow their rules. I eat their food. I have to socialize with my mom's bf and his guests, who I've known for years, but as an introvert-leaning person does not feel like family to me, and thus requires a huge amount of social energy. \n\nAnd on top of this - you have expressed to the gf that she is not 100% welcome there, and that she alone does not belong there.

They need time on Christmas morning? Great. Looking forward to seeing you for dinner. How about asking if there were any traditions or favourite foods that remind her of her mom that you could provide that night, if it would feel comforting to her? How about asking her if she wants to include any memory about her mom in the way you celebrate that evening?\n\nSeriously. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d her, why she needs what she needs, or why your son is prioritizing those needs. It\u2019s called empathy.

At least show some compassion and stop making it all about you.\n\nEdited to add: if this is how you respond to this compromise it explains a lot about what your son meant about \u201cperforming and navigating the personal issues\u201d.

You are pushing for more why? Also, looking at how you've interacted with them at far, what's happened is that they've expressed how they feel and drawn their boundaries, and instead of listening, you've argued/dismissed at every turn. Instead of accepting this is how they feel and what they need, you question why, and when they explain, you make it clear that according to you their reasons aren't valid or good enough.

They both came at me with anger and contempt about how they didn't want to be around a big group of people but it would only be me, my boyfriend, my younger son and his girlfriend. They met my boyfriend and my younger son's girlfriend this past summer when they moved back so they're not strangers. \n\nMy son said they don't have the \"emotional bandwidth to deal with performing and navigating the personal issues that come up in the group dynamic.\" \n\nThey said they didn't want to have to pretend to be happy and feel bad about not feeling cheerful, and gave me an ultimatum about how if I didn't understand then they wouldn't come and just my son would come up alone for a visit after Christmas but he wasn't leaving his wife alone on Christmas Eve and day. \n\nI don't understand why they wouldn't want to be around family and friends and why they feel like my home is not a safe place for them. I set up a room for them and even told them they can eat breakfast and dinner alone in their room if that's what they need. \n\nMy DIL said she didn't want to feel like she had to hide away to feel safe and that she knew she would need to cry at times like on Christmas morning and she didn't want to cry in front of people or feel like she was bringing down other people's happiness. I told her we all understand so it's fine.\n\nI couldn't handle having this conversation over email and they could have called me to talk to me about this so I bowed out. My DIL said she understood and that there were pros and cons to both phone calls and written messages but that it was important that we all talk about our feelings. But when I spoke from the heart I got ultimatums and how is me being upset and disappointed about them choosing not to spend Christmas with me so hard to understand?

Christmas dinner will likely also be tough for her, but she\u2019s trying here; I think you aren\u2019t able to see it because it doesn\u2019t fit what you want, so you\u2019re disregarding their efforts.  Your DIL would likely much prefer to stay home all day on Christmas as part of her grieving, but is extending this offer out of kindness and love for her husband and you.\n\nI realize what they are offering isn\u2019t everything you want and that having your sons together with you on Christmas is important to you.  So do they.  That\u2019s why they are planning to come over for Christmas dinner despite the fact that it will be a really difficult day for your DIL.  \n\nIt is disingenuous that you are pretending your place is a \u201csafe space\u201d for them.  Last year, you and your other son made it clear that her being there without her husband was weird; she doesn\u2019t really belong there.  When she tried to explain that she was overwhelmed by a family party earlier in the year, you behaved poorly.  If you want to become a safe place for her, you\u2019ll need to act like one.  \n\nI don\u2019t think you see how close you are to permanently fracturing these relationships.  When someone keeps trying to meet you halfway and you keep rejecting their efforts, they will stop trying.  This doesn\u2019t end where you think it does with them just doing exactly what you want.  They just realize you\u2019ll never be happy and do exactly what they would prefer to do.\n\nIf you want to salvage the relationship and give it a future, you\u2019ll tell them that you appreciate how difficult that time will be for them, want to give them the space they need to grieve and are grateful that you\u2019ll have them with you for Christmas dinner and look forward to spending time with them and apologize for making your preferences take center stage at a difficult time for them.  Recognize that what they are offering is the best they can offer and appreciate it.\n\nOr, dig your heels in, insist she\u2019s grieving wrong, insist that you\u2019ll be respectful despite her previous experience to the contrary, and see how that goes.

Your family insulted your DIL and called her weird when she did go out of her way to visit you \n\n2.

It's not automatically a judgement of your family not being good enough for her. This is her asking for a social break. Maybe she had already been intetacting with a lot of people that day. It takes social stamina to interact with people, even when they are people she genuinely likes. \n\nIf she really does have  a problem intetacting with your family as you say, then I agree with the other commentor that replied to your comment here. If your family is the type that expects her to be constantly engaged without any break when you're together, that's going to be exhausting for anyone.

A little over two months ago, my father in law passed away.\n\nIt's never easy the first Christmas after especially. You feel guilty for not being in the spirit, and whenever you are in the spirit and enjoying the moment, you then feel guilty for that too. My daughter just turned 5 and I just want her to have great childhood Christmas memories, so I do my best to push through and act like everything is fine, but it's exhausting.  I can absolutely understand why OP and his wife may want to just stay home or limit their social time. OP needs to have some freaking empathy. Would she expect her sons to shrug it off months after she passes?", "Exactly! OP\u2019s DIL is already giving so much! I can\u2019t imagine having to be with this family for any amount of time while grieving the loss of my mother over the holidays. Yet they were willing to stay for multiple days? DIL is a saint. \nShe\u2019s probably still in the \u201cif I\u2019m genuinely happy, did I even love my mom\u201d phase. \nOP, YTA", "My parents have done a great job of compromising with the holidays as me and my sisters have gotten older and gotten into relationships and guess what? All their kids make it a priority to use their vacation time and come in town to see them. My parents are very clear that they would love to have us and our significant others here, but they understand that it's not going to be every holiday, or even that it will be every other holiday, depending on what may come up. As a result they get almost every holiday. It's less stressful to deal with people who are understanding, accommodating and appreciative of the fact that we sometimes have other commitments. I can't recommend this approach enough if you want to stay in your adult children's lives.  Asking \"what can I do to help?\" goes a long, long way.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Sending hugs and love", "Also, in saying 'I don't mind' if DIL is crying, it completely negates how the daughter-in-law is feeling. The daughter-in-law doesn't want to cry in front of you. It's about her feelings, not yours. She's not okay with crying in front of everyone and that's what she's saying. I'd suggest you respect their wishes now, or lose future Christmas is all together", "Same. My ILs treat me like a guest, not family. It got to the point they volunteered to throw a baby shower but wouldn't let me invite my friends so I had to cancel and I was insulted by MIL. I told her family wouldn't do what she did and ever since then we are civil", "As a DIL, I would bet a lot of money it was definitely part of those divorces. How your in-laws treat you can help make or break a relationship.", "Honestly, I keep thinking that what OP really means in all of this is \u201cher mom\u2019s dead, so now you should spend all of every holiday with me!\u201d", "I was thinking just this.  When someone mentions a family member is throwing out an ultimatum, my mind immediately thinks, \"Ultimatums aren't first choices.  They are the result of trending behavior.\"", "This is the next thing to keep coming up in these comment sections \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \nYTA op, it's fresh, either let them come Christmas day and be there a couple of days as they suggested or skip it. 2 years ago my dad died in October, none of us were feeling the holidays but we did a little something anyway for my kids since they're still little. Even now I don't feel the holidays like I used to. Let her process how she needs to", "\"We don't mind.\"  \n\nSHE MINDS. SHE MINDS VERY MUCH.\n\nUnbelievable selfishness.\n\nYTA", "Gentle YTA. I was like you. No matter how much we understand intellectually that our children are grown with lives and concerns of their own, we don't always emotionally accept that.  But here's the thing, when we don't respect our children's boundaries and respect the fact that their lives are theirs to live, it causes a rift. . . .parents feelings are hurt, child feels guilty and angry and resentful and no one wins.  Reading this, your son and DIL were being really generous with their time. Christmas Day and 2 days after that to spend with them. And then explained why they were choosing not to spend Christmas Eve and morning.  Your efforts to \"accommodate\" those reasons, could have easily been interpreted as manipulation. Your DIL is grieving.  And she wants the comfort and privacy of her own home to do that, but was willing to set aside her own grief and make time for you. They clearly communicated their needs and wishes and made space for you also.  Appreciate that and be grateful for it.  Our adult children do not owe us their time or space in their lives.  We are not the center of their world and shouldn't be. And at this point in your career as a mother, your children should no longer be the center of your world either.  Let go of whatever fantasies you have/had of what being a parent to adult children is supposed to look like and concentrate on fostering a good relationship. And that starts with boundaries and respect and letting go to an extent.", "Look, you're not T A for *wanting* something. We all want things. YTA for pressuring and arguing and not accepting their decision. And I think you actually know that, which is why you asked if you were T A for wanting something. You don't sound very respectful of other people or their feelings.", "OP, when they call you to talk this through say this and only this\n\n\n\"I understand that you are grieving and I am so sorry for your loss. I understand that the process of grieving looks different for everyone, and what you need in this very difficult time is more important than my needs. I am here for you whatever you need, even if that means I don't get to spend as much time with you as I would like. Please let me know how I can make you more comfortable and make my home a safe space for you when you decide you do want to come. You are my family and I am here for you. \"\n\n\nThat's it. It's not about you and what you need. It's not about how she feels about the family. She is not trying to insult you. She is trying to get through what may be the most difficult time in her life. She is in survival mode and you are mot helping. Once again, ITS NOT ABOUT YOU. Be there for them in the way they need you to be. That's it, that's all. \nYTA.", "I knew it was going to be YTA just based on the title. Such a blatant self-victimization almost always comes from someone in the wrong.", "Not only is this post screaming YTA but I\u2019m also reading the comments OP has left\u2026 to roughly quote, all I\u2019m seeing is things like \u201cshe doesn\u2019t fit in\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ve had issues but they\u2019re behind us\u201d \u201cwhy don\u2019t they feel safe?\u201d. \n\nWell OP maybe it\u2019s because you can\u2019t get your head far enough out of your rear end to realize that not every couple or family functions the same way. Your DIL probably doesn\u2019t feel safe because not only are you disrespecting her boundaries but you\u2019re dropping rude and inconsiderate comments on Reddit about how you think she hasn\u2019t fit in or how you had \u2018issues\u2019\u2026 which by the lack of resolve given probably isn\u2019t in the past. You just think things are dandy and fine because what she is going through DOES NOT AFFECT YOU. You don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s feeling because it really sounds like you\u2019re not taking a moment to even think about how she feels and what her perspective is on this situation. You\u2019re confused by her actions because you can\u2019t comprehend the loss she is feeling. Take a moment to think about the life she has lost not just what you\u2019ll be losing over xmas by them not being present. \n\nAll you\u2019ve done in your post and comments is complain about not being understood when you can\u2019t even understand your DIL. Seems pretty hypocritical to me.", "YTA. \n\nYou also seem like the type to be all \u201cidk why my child went no contact\u201d despite being horribly insensitive and tone deaf.", "YTA. He's committing to spending two fucking days after Christmas with you and that isn't enough? He's 30 fucking 4. He's a grown man. Please understand that you have to cut the umbilical cord at point.

They are struggling, they are doing their best to compromise and give you what you want, but nothing is good enough. You're behaving in a high maintenance way, and your son told you, politely, that he and his wife are at the end of their rope with you. If you don't lay off with the Christmas demands, they are likely to stop coming at all.", "You don't seem like an a-hole, OP. But you were in the wrong here.", "Exactly! I was devastated by grief during Christmas one year, and my hosts didn\u2019t understand why I left the Christmas Eve party to talk on the phone upstairs. Like I was being rude. When in fact I felt like a knife went through my heart when I saw the kids run into the room to open their gifts. And I didn\u2019t want to ruin the Larry with my tears. \n\nI used to host our family Christmas, big fire in the fireplace, turkey in the oven, gifts all around even for the dogs, romance with my husband.

You\u2019d be encouraging them to come out of the room, join the others, get over it and every other wrong thing to say and do. \n\nYou should have accepted their plans the first time, and respected their need to grieve. Instead you are pressuring them to grieve on your terms. Just stop with all this and let them do them. Be kind and understanding and supportive instead. Stop trying to get your way.", "I thought DIL preferred e-mails because she is too emotional to make phone calls.

I couldn't deal with the draining emotions of the holiday, so I sent my husband to his family several states over for a few days. He understood, they understood. I think I visited with my mom for a short while, I honestly don't even remember with that fog of grief. Neither of us wanted company other than each other because we were the ones that lived it.\n\nIn my opinion, DIL is putting OPs needs ahead of herself for visiting even as long as she is. First holidays are the worst after a loss.", "Agree. Had she made her Daughter In Law feel welcome then this may be a different scenario. She said that DIL should feel safe. Haha.

Notice how she says she \"spoke from the heart\" but gave zero details about what was said nor how?  I have a feeling email left the S/DIL more comfortable because they could precisely say exactly what they wanted and not have their words misheard or misinterpreted, and they could go back and say 'Mom, that is literally not what we said, here read it again'.\n\nOP is 100% TA.", "Op, you already answered it yourself.

I had a former friend say to me \"sorry that your dad is sick but you've been making some treats for us when we go backpacking, do you have new things you're planning on making?\".  Like there was no concept of that I wouldn't still be doing that - like just how their expectations would be continued to be met regardless of my situation.

We refuse to keep giving into her demands and we won't continue putting our children in the middle of a battle. We've set firm boundaries and we're spreading visits further apart each time. If she continues like she is, she'll be nothing but a fuzzy memory to our children. This is your future if you can't accept their boundaries. They are very clearly telling you what they need and you're choosing to ignore it. They don't have to spend any part of Christmas with you. They don't have to visit at all or even speak to you. So instead of griping about the one day you don't get, you should be grateful for the time they're giving you.
