Dating someone with kids is a minefield because ultimately, if the relationship is to progress, that will mean you taking on some role in the kid\u2019s life, so you can\u2019t stay completely out of their business forever - after a certain point you DO get to have opinions on parenting choices.\n\nHowever I\u2019d say that your way of raising the issue, by just off the bat telling him it\u2019s inappropriate, was not the greatest approach.  There are legitimate reasons for an older kid to share a room with a parent - disabilities or mental health issues could mean they NEED that degree of closeness.  So it may have been better for you to politely ask about the reason behind her need to share a room with him, rather than challenging it in the way you did.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m still saying NTA is his response to you.  The way he immediately got loudly, aggressively defensive when you raised the matter, makes me feel like maybe there is something inappropriate going on and he\u2019s evading the issue by making you the villain.  If I was in a situation like that and someone challenged me on it, and there was a legitimate explanation, sure I might be frustrated with them but I would DEFINITELY give the reason, to make it absolutely clear that I was doing nothing wrong.  His aggression and lack of any good reason makes me deeply suspicious of him - at this point even if he does come back with a plausible explanation, I\u2019d still be concerned that his initial blow-up was a way of stalling for time to construct a story.", "Same bedroom or same bed?", "Yuck, lay off of the incest porn and come back to the real world.

Now they're saying a 14 yr old is ok to share bed with her dad", "It\u2019s strange that for decades it was considered a taboo, because of possible incest occurring, and now here we are! People mixing up healthy parenting, with co-sharing your bed, with your teenager. Internet trolls are in full force on Reddit lately.", "And how is the reason for her to do so any of your business?", "Just ask yourself why it would be inappropriate to have a close father - daughter bond. This is a you problem. Unless he is a pervert there is nothing inappropriate about kids seeking the comfort of feeling safe and being close to their parent. And as a feminist I tell you to let go of this gender bias, an father is no lesser parent than a mother, and has no reason not to comfort her, and be close to her. If  you are jealous that they are so close don't date someone with a kid. The kid will be first as long as it is dependent, when it is a good parent.", "And you just \u201cthink it\u2019s weird\u201d. How come her liking it isn\u2019t a valid reason, but you not liking it is?", "\ud83d\udea9 It sounds like the teen might have some dependency issues that need to be worked on before it causes too many issues as an adult.", "Immensely.", "No. Not really. I was more asking because I was reading the other comments and everyone seemed to be saying this wasn\u2019t a big deal so I was trying to find some reason why they would be saying she is the asshole. I think it\u2019s fucked up. There is no reason why a girl her age should be sleeping in her fathers room whether on the floor or in the bed with him. It\u2019s fucking gross. I have a six year old daughter I wouldn\u2019t let sleep in my bed unless she is really sick.", "Did she accuse him of molesting his daughter tho? As far as I can tell, the \"it's inappropriate\" comment was more regarding an unhealthy attachment style between father and daughter.", "Then why accuse him of it??", "This sounds like a codependency issue...", "[deleted]", "Thanks for saying this.", "We also don't know if this child has any trauma or abandonment issues after their parents' separation or mother's death or whatever happened. Maybe she just likes to know her dad is still there.", "Of course he got defensive and angry when his girlfriend said his parenting was inappropriate and weird. It was an offensive comment.", "because she accused him of being sexual with his daughter. *nobody* is going to react calmly to that", "Omg he\u2019s defensive because she\u2019s implying he\u2019s sexual with his *daughter*. Fuck off. \n\nHe also defensive because the daughter is clearly choosing this. He\u2019s not forcing her and it\u2019s fuckign weird for his gf to accuse him", "Fathers get attacked often for being even slightly physical (I talk cuddleing) with their children. At least you see that all over the internet. If I was under the impression my partner would imply that the physical contact to my child is sexual I would become angry as well.", "Toughen up, getting comfort from a parent is only for toddlers! Actually to be able to be close to a parent can help becoming a confident, self assured adult whirmth healthy non-toxic relationships in their life.", "Could you explain further?", "In my opinion that\u2019s really unfortunate for your daughter", "You having different preference is fine, but why is that gross?? Narrow mindedness maybe..", "And who the F is she - or are you - to judge what style of attachment between father and daughter is healthy?", "not at all. if I\u2019m ever at his place and tired or sick, it\u2019s just a bonding thing to wanna sleep with my dad. I lost my mom years ago so I cherish the time I have with my last living parent. it\u2019s not weird or codependent, I\u2019m just always going to be his little girl as he put it so he always welcome it.", "OP wrote \"some nights\"", "Yes, sometimes. Like how OP\u2019s (probably now ex) boyfriend\u2019s daughter sleeps in her father\u2019s room on some nights. You\u2019ve told yourself quite a story about these people, likely due to projection and the worry of people living their lives without being subject to your armchair psychobabble.", "Setting up another area in which to sleep in the same room is a protection-focused approach.\n\nSleeping in the same bed could mean a few different things.", "We never let our kids sleep in our bed. Even after they were born they went right into their cribs. Our kids are fine. No issues. Why do you say that\u2019s unfortunate for my daughter?", "Your doing the same thing OP is doing \n\nProtection from what exactly?", "I get that and I\u2019m not saying it has to be a common occurrence but I think if your daughter for example was having a really bad day and just wants to lay with her parents sometimes it should be available", "We snuggle on the couch. At bedtime my kids go to their beds and me and my wife to ours."]}
