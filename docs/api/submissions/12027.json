So, you're not in a position to \"go too far.\" If your sister thinks your brother is being punished too excessively, then her issue is with your parents, not you. \n\nBut if your brother has explicitly stated that he feels no remorse for bullying someone, that's a problem. I say you did the right thing in letting your parents handle it. Let's hope they handle this appropriately.\n\nHowever, your brother is never going to trust you again.", "NTA.  Your brother\u2019s age doesn\u2019t matter.  He still chose to act in homophobic and racist ways, and he has no remorse at all.  Your brother is still a kid, but he is old enough to know between right and wrong.  He is only doing what he has to do to get his devices back.  If his horrible behaviour is ever going to change - your parents need to know what is really going on.", "NTA. It's obvious your brother did not learn his lesson from his punishment. If he doesn't feel any remorse, he probably still thinks he did nothing wrong, and will likely continue this behaviour in the future. I don't think your parents are going to get anywhere with grounding him, but you did the right thing by telling your parents.", "Nta. But parents need to learn, when you take away devices, the school laptop needs to be only used in front of the parents.", "NTA. Your brother needs to learn this stuff now, before it becomes an even worse issue.", "You did nothing wrong. Your brother - however young - needs to learn accountability and responsibility. \n\nIf he isn't checked now, then things will only get worse in the long term.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Your brother needs to get over his awful behavior now, before he grows up and becomes an even worse adult", "NTA. It's important to hold people accountable for their actions, especially when those actions are harmful and hurtful towards others. Your brother's behavior was unacceptable, and it's not okay for him to use a fake apology to get out of trouble.\n\nYou did the right thing by recording the conversation and showing it to your parents. It's important for them to know the truth about your brother's behavior so they can take appropriate action and help him learn from his mistakes.\n\nWhile your sister may feel that you went too far, it's important to remember that your brother's behavior was not just a mistake. It was harmful and hurtful towards another person, and it's important for him to understand the impact of his actions.\n\nIt's understandable that your brother is still a kid and may not fully understand the consequences of his actions, but it's important for him to learn and grow from this experience. Holding him accountable and teaching him the importance of empathy and respect towards others is crucial for his growth and development.\n\nIn summary, you did the right thing by bringing the truth to your parents' attention and helping your brother learn from his mistakes. It's important to hold people accountable for their actions and to promote a culture of empathy and respect towards others.", "NTA. It\u2019s good you caught him doing this so he has the opportunity to reflect on his actions! I\u2019d love to see an AI apology letter tho.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he'd gotten away with it he would probably continue down this path of bullying which could lead to lifelong much worse consequences not only for him but the people he chooses to bully.", "YTA - Your brother accomplished the task to fulfill his punishment. At eleven years old, he may not have known what to say or how to express it. His resourcefulness was impressive. If he doesn't feel that he did anything wrong, that wouldn't have been changed by him writing the letter all on his own. He should be judged by whether or not he continues the behavior in the future.", "I'm sorry I don't agree with you here. His letter should have been from the heart and not an AI dictating his letter. His parents gave him a light punishment considering the actions he did and now he totally got around the punishment with it.", "The whole point of writing the apology letter is to understand the harm he\u2019s done, not to be resourceful and find a way out of it. \nThis is why so many young people nowadays REFUSE to take accountability for their actions. JFC.", "I hope I never have to meet any kids you raise, because if this is how you view parenting you're going to be inflicting straight up monsters on the world. Yikes.", "NTA but this also reminded me heavily of the newest South Park episode", "Your sister is 14 with a very classic reductive view about the impact of her and your brothers actions mixing the typically selfish tendencies of teens. She see's this as a simple mistake that didn't hurt anyone when it actually just added to the mountain of strain on a young boy who will likely spend his life dealing with people like your brother.\n\nAlso, it's just plain sad that your brother is either so disdainful towards this kid or so incapable with the written language that he needed an AI bot to write a basic apology letter for him. He can't even fake it reasonably enough on his own. That's a whole ass tragedy on its own and your parents might consider putting him in a few afterschool programs to account for his apparent difficulties with literacy as well as counseling for his racism and homophobia issues. If nothing else this will eat up his time around his friends who enabled his toxic tendencies.\n\nNTA", "First off, what a fantastic piece of fanfic.\n\nBased on that, YTA.\n\nAlso the AH because why would you snitch?", "NTA for outing OP's brother's unrepentant attitude.  However, in many jurisdictions, it is illegal to record a person without their consent. Other jurisdictions have a single party consent rule, i.e. that a recording is lawful if one person consents to the recording, i.e. OP.   Not knowing where OP lives, it is not possible to determine whether OP's recording was wrong.", "YTA because you tattling won't teach your brother anything. Instead of helping your brother by guiding him on how it was wrong or why using AI to circumvent his punishment was wrong, you caused him to get in more serious trouble. You want him to feel guilty for what he had done, but now all he is going to feel is resentment and anger toward you instead of reflecting on his actions. Do you like you brother, want him to succeed, and stop going down this path of being a jerk or do you just want to see him get in trouble? Right now, you caused him to get in trouble, so he's not going to trust you and tell you anything that could get him in trouble. You won't be able to help teach him right from wrong next time because he won't disclose anything with you. If he didn't listen and was brushing you off, then that would've been the time to talk with your parents.", "NTA. But I'm surprised the school hasn't blocked ChatGPT on their chromebooks lol", "NTA It's not like he used it because he couldn't express his feelings right and needed help but to get away with writing it at all and to mock your parents and his victim.\n\nYour parents are doing right being strict with him and I hope he changes for the better. If he doesn't though, get read to leave as soon as you hit 18 and/or help them kick him out when he's 18.", "Nta. Your sister is trying to talk you into enabling a bully.  I would almost say she needs a small taste of what he's dishing out so she can understand how bullying makes others feel and why it shouldn't be tolerated. She clearly lacks empathy, or agrees with him, if she's trying to defend him.", "NTA \n\nYour brother is 11, and his bullying and bigotry need to be seriously addressed now. Your parents are trying, and she doesn't understand or is choosing to ignore how serious this is.", "NTA. But you have a responsibility to not just tell your parents. The most important role you have is to be clear to both your siblings that the things your brother has done (bullying, homophobic and racist acts) are not ok. It matters more when such opinions come from \"someone on your level\" than from above."]}
