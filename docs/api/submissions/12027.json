So, you're not in a position to \"go too far.\" If your sister thinks your brother is being punished too excessively, then her issue is with your parents, not you. \n\nBut if your brother has explicitly stated that he feels no remorse for bullying someone, that's a problem. I say you did the right thing in letting your parents handle it. Let's hope they handle this appropriately.\n\nHowever, your brother is never going to trust you again.", "NTA.  Your brother\u2019s age doesn\u2019t matter.  He still chose to act in homophobic and racist ways, and he has no remorse at all.  Your brother is still a kid, but he is old enough to know between right and wrong.  He is only doing what he has to do to get his devices back.  If his horrible behaviour is ever going to change - your parents need to know what is really going on.", "NTA. It's obvious your brother did not learn his lesson from his punishment. If he doesn't feel any remorse, he probably still thinks he did nothing wrong, and will likely continue this behaviour in the future. I don't think your parents are going to get anywhere with grounding him, but you did the right thing by telling your parents.", "Nta. But parents need to learn, when you take away devices, the school laptop needs to be only used in front of the parents.", "NTA. Your brother needs to learn this stuff now, before it becomes an even worse issue.", "You did nothing wrong. Your brother - however young - needs to learn accountability and responsibility. \n\nIf he isn't checked now, then things will only get worse in the long term.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Your brother needs to get over his awful behavior now, before he grows up and becomes an even worse adult", "NTA. It's important to hold people accountable for their actions, especially when those actions are harmful and hurtful towards others. Your brother's behavior was unacceptable, and it's not okay for him to use a fake apology to get out of trouble.\n\nYou did the right thing by recording the conversation and showing it to your parents. It's important for them to know the truth about your brother's behavior so they can take appropriate action and help him learn from his mistakes.\n\nWhile your sister may feel that you went too far, it's important to remember that your brother's behavior was not just a mistake. It was harmful and hurtful towards another person, and it's important for him to understand the impact of his actions.\n\nIt's understandable that your brother is still a kid and may not fully understand the consequences of his actions, but it's important for him to learn and grow from this experience. Holding him accountable and teaching him the importance of empathy and respect towards others is crucial for his growth and development.\n\nIn summary, you did the right thing by bringing the truth to your parents' attention and helping your brother learn from his mistakes. It's important to hold people accountable for their actions and to promote a culture of empathy and respect towards others.", "NTA. It\u2019s good you caught him doing this so he has the opportunity to reflect on his actions! I\u2019d love to see an AI apology letter tho.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he'd gotten away with it he would probably continue down this path of bullying which could lead to lifelong much worse consequences not only for him but the people he chooses to bully.", "YTA - Your brother accomplished the task to fulfill his punishment. At eleven years old, he may not have known what to say or how to express it. His resourcefulness was impressive. If he doesn't feel that he did anything wrong, that wouldn't have been changed by him writing the letter all on his own. He should be judged by whether or not he continues the behavior in the future.", "I'm sorry I don't agree with you here. His letter should have been from the heart and not an AI dictating his letter. His parents gave him a light punishment considering the actions he did and now he totally got around the punishment with it.", "The whole point of writing the apology letter is to understand the harm he\u2019s done, not to be resourceful and find a way out of it. \nThis is why so many young people nowadays REFUSE to take accountability for their actions.
