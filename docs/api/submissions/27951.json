Next time call her bluff, i.e., call an ambulance. Meanwhile YOU should seek the help of a therapist who specializes in addiction and/or attend Al-Anon meetings either online or in person, so you have support and can learn how to deal with your  addicted spouse. She seems to be wrestling with demons and is self-treating mental illness with alcholol, and also trying to manipulate you in a very immature way. My heart goes out to you both. Edit: obviously, she needs to completely abstain from alcohol and get treatment from mental health professionals. There is no \"half-way\" with addiction - it's like a heroin addict saying they'll only use a tiny bit. That's not how it works.", "It's worthless to reason with alcoholics. They always look for someone to blame and gaslight. Your wife shouldn't drink at all. Nothing. Zero. Any comfort associated with her being drunk is harming.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThe line \"hand them over to a medical professional for an evaluation\" is what needs to be applied to your wife. \n\nYou are her spouse. Addressing alcoholism, especially that which involves a previous rehab stint, requires medical professionals outside of the spouse.  That is especially true when telling the affected person to stop makes them label you \"the bad guy.\" \n\nYou are neither a psychologist nor a therapist. What she needs is a psychologist, therapist, AA, and/or rehab. \n\nIt's clear from what you're describing that she needs to quit drinking entirely.\n\nIt may be worthwhile to consider making an ultimatum for her. Either she seeks treatment in order to stop drinking or there will be a change in your relationship.", "NTA. I used to do this when I was 18-19. My partner would be going to sleep and if I didn\u2019t feel I had been loved/cuddled adequately, I would start to toss and turn deliberately and then sob quietly. If that didn\u2019t work I\u2019d go to another room and cry loudly till he got up to comfort me.\n\nIt was super fucking manipulative and rude. But it was all deliberate. My partner put his foot down on it after a month. And I\u2019m so thankful he did. Made me reevaluate a lot of my behaviours.\n\nMy point is. OP SHE US DOING IT DELIBERATELY FOR ATTENTION AND/OR TO START A FIGHT.\n\nYou need to nip this now. But tbh reading other stuff. It might be best to look at going on a break from the relationship.

She needs to quit drinking.", "Well first an alcoholic should NEVER have even one drink once they get sober.  They are taught that in rehab, and are continually told that in out patient care so she should NOT be drinking, period!  She is not sober, she is still giving into her addiction, and I'm sorry, but you're enabling her at this point.  You need to stop that, now!\n\nSecond, if you have sleep apnea, you need to get a sleep study, and get treated for it.  Sleep apnea, if untreated can eventually kill you, and cause other health issues along the way.\n\nThird, and I will get blasted for this, you were right to walk away.  When an alcoholic is being unreasonable, and attention seeking, as she was being, the best thing to do is to walk away, and not engage.

This has to stop. She is being manipulative.", "I was married to an blackout drunk alcoholic for many years. Very early on I refuse to let him sleep in my bed. I'm not ruining my comfort by sleeping next to someone who is passed out.  He was drunk to some degree every day that we were married. In that time, I would let him lay his own vomit passed on the floor or couch or wherever he ended up... He wants to drink himself to death, that's his prerogative. His discomfort was his own problem. Don't let her make you feel bad about that. Seriously. You are NTA", "Nts, she just shouldn't be drinking", "NTA. She should be essentially ignored if she chooses to drink. The cycle of drinking and being comforted amounts to positive reinforcement of drinking.", "Is she always manipulative?", "You are NTA.

Because alcoholics typically build up a tolerance and often hide drinking. \n\nOr it\u2019s possible that even moderate drinking is triggering an anxiety disorder that she\u2019s typically able to mask. \n\nEither way you want to get her help. That doesn\u2019t mean comforting her when she\u2019s been drinking, but it may mean helping her start seeing a therapist and to meetings for alcohol misuse. You cockle perhaps go to some meetings with her and learn the program she uses (like AA) sos you can support her.", "INFO: I\u2019m confused.

I can't say *you* should have done more in that situation because I would have walked away sooner than you did. I don't try to reason with people affected by alcohol; as long as they're safe, I'm leaving the conversation until they're sober.\n\nShe's been to rehab so she knows the deal - she can't have a casual relationship with alcohol. Two drinks are not just two drinks for her. \n\nSo...aside from the recent spat, you have deeper issues. If she continues to drink, what then? How many of these episodes are you willing to live through?", "NTA!  These are the \"games\" of an alcoholic who apparently isn't willing to help herself.", "NTA. It's incredibly tough to deal with a partner's addiction. She should be getting professional help.

Why are you providing her feedback only when she's drunk?\n\nI do think YTA. I also think your last sentence comes across as slightly more shaming than supportive. It's more \"I tried to help and you rejected it\" rather than \"Yes dear, remember I'm happy to help.\" I believe your defensiveness and need for you to be right has become a wall. You cannot be right in this situation, you can only give your best to someone else, and I think your communication overemphasizes the former over the latter. When she was upset at you not comforting her, you had an opportunity *then and there* to (try to) comfort her.
