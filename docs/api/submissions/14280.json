I was under the impression that they liked me until my partner told me that they always slagged me off behind my back. My mother in law even tried to hook my partner up with a rich older man whilst we were together a few years at that point. I'm basically a guy that's had his problems with mental health which in turn affected him ever having a decent job and that's why I assume that her mum didn't like me, but I love the bones off her daughter and I've never mistreated her and never will.\n\nSo I was at home and my partner came in after seeing her family and told me that her sister and boyfriend are staying at our house for a couple of nights. I asked if I had a say in this and she told me that her step father told her \"they are staying at yours\" and my partner just accepted it as she dislikes conflict. That really angered me because that kind of behaviour is toxic and pretty rude, common decency would be to ask us both whether we'd like to have them stay at our house or we ask her sister and partner ourselves so I told my partner that I'm not happy with it. My partner then told her mum that her sister can't stay and then her mom got angry and drove over to the house! When she got here I recieved a tirade of abuse and made me feel like the guilty one but I gave as good as I got. Her mum landed a few low blows and eventually she left. Her mom then wanted my partner to leave me because I'm controlling and even asked my partner if I've ever hit her to which my partner said \"no!\". This happened about 6 months ago and even though me and her mum both made up over text my partner has told me that her mum still doesn't forgive me for how I spoke to her the night she shouted at me on my door step.

(No sponsoring down payments, no living in one of his houses at reduced rent or rent-free?)\n\nI", "NTA but her mother and stepfather are. Who stays in your house is for you and your partner to decide, not a bully boy stepfather. I'd definitely say go NC until they can learn to treat you with the respect you deserve. Don't be a doormat to them. It may not be possible financially or logistically but if you can I'd flit to a house and area chosen by you and your partner not her mother and don't give your new address to any of them. Then relax, enjoy and make some babies!!", "To be honest I think my partner is scared of her mom but judging by how insane and angry she was when she was shouting at me I'm kind of not surprised if she was scared of her. I've had 10 years of being the bad guy whos never been involved in her family gatherings and I've only ever met her step dad in person twice and that was once when he tried getting his friend to intimidate me for a joke and a second time I went into his house which he seemed to like me. I'd love to marry my partner but the wedding day would be too awkward and I've also put off having children with her due to her mum and step dad in the past too.", "I think you're right but I doubt my partner will ever be firm with them.", "I've had 10 years of being the bad guy and to be honest at one point I actually started to believe them in that I  was the bad guy until I thought super deep about everything and thought \"I show their daughter love\"' \"I've never hurt their daughter physically\", \"I pull my weight around the house\", \"I work albeit in a low paying job\" etc and then I actually started thinking about the things her mum and step dad have said about me in the past and how they've alienated me right from the beginning. Also her mum seemed obsessed throughout the years of hooking her daughter up with a rich guy!", "That's exactly what I thought, growing up in my family that is definitely not a normal way of doing things unless you're a bully as only bullies force things on others.", "Definitely!", "Yeah true, I honestly despise being around her mum because she gives off a really horrible vibe. When her mum comes over the house I'm usually in two minds \"get of the way so I don't have to deal with her\" and \"it's my fucking house I shouldn't have to hide away\" lol", "Yeah they are controlling, there's so many examples I could give of crazy things that they've done in the past that I wished that I handled differently which was probably the reason why it let to me standing up for myself and shouting back at her mum after years of her mum getting her own way with everything, one being when her mum replaced me and started viewing houses with my partner without me knowing and my partner came home and told me that they viewed a really nice house (that we now live in) and I of course found that bizarre so the first time I viewed this house was on the day I moved in!", "Thanks", "Nope, if anything he made it harder for us to be able to buy our own house as he kicked her out of his house after a few months of me and her being together.", "There's no doubt you have a lot of love for your partner. I feel for you. Everyone deserves a partner that will stand up for them, especially when those attacks come from your inlaws.  You mentioned hesitating to have children with them because of the would be grandparents but the reality of this hesitation stems from your partners potential inability to be a good parent because they lack the ability to stand up for themselves, you, and your potential children.  Talk with your partner and express your concerns. The topic of children may trigger a change in them and potentially consider going NC with the inlaws.", "I recommend you and your partner read Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson.\n\nIt will give you both insight on their behaviour and your partner's reactions.\n\nAs someone who has a challenging relationship with their parents, I think your partner would benefit from therapy to understand how boundaries and healthy relationships work.", "you write that you put off marriage and children with her because if her parents and her inability to stand up to them. have you discussed couple counseling with her and individual counseling for her? you are literally putting off your life for someone. that is making you ta right now, but not for this situation.", "Right, so basically stepdad is a bully. And he has no say on what goes on in your house. Your partner's family are enablers at best, but AH's is more likely. \n\nYour partner is probably too scared to actively put her foot down. And looking at your comments she probably has a reason to be scared. But her telling you all about how her mom is still trash talking you does not help. \n\nHer instantly saying no to her sister staying after you said no tells me she's on your side. But you two need to be smart about this. Antagonizing her family will only lead to more fights and agression, which will make your partner stressed and miserable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are NTA for anything you say to that family, considering what they did to you. But team up with your partner, actively manage this dumpster fire of a family together.", "I've actually asked my partner to go to counselling and she said that she didn't want to. Also putting off marriage isn't too much of a big deal as we don't need marriage to be happy but having children is massively important to me. In the past I've put off having kids but in this moment we are trying for a baby because I need a family and I'll just have to take the consequences from her toxic family in the long run but at least I'll have my own children which I'll love more than anything.", "Yeah I've always got the impression that he's a bully, yeah her telling me everything her mum says about me could be seen as a bad and a good thing but I think i appreciate her telling me as otherwise I'd probably treat her family with utmost love and respect only to be having the piss taken out of me behind my back. Yeah I do get the impression that she's on my side and I'd never antagonise her family as causing my partner stress is the last thing I'd want. Thanks for the sound advice I appreciate it.", "Obviously NTA. It's your house as well as your partners. There is no reason your partner or her parents couldn't and picked up the phone and roped you in the conversation about SIL staying at your place.  Not to do so is hugely disrespectful. You responded as most of us would. And your MIL coming over to blow up at you over it was totally out of line. If she is still unhappy, that is just too bad. \n\nI might suggest some serious talks with your partner about setting setting boundaries with her parents, or even couples counseling if she continues to have problems with doing anything that might displease them.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo have a lot less contact with AH MIL.", "mate, you can't live your life in fear of what your inlaws might not like. Its time to have the hard conversations about marriage and kids, because if you want to marry her and have kids, do it for yourselves. \n\nbecause do you want your kids around her parents, and will she back you up if they start bad mouthing you to your own kids.\n\nShe needs to grow a spine", "I feel for both you and your partner. I think it\u2019s important to hold onto the fact that when you\u2019re raised in this kind of abusive dynamic the fear level (even over very small things) is much higher than someone who wasn\u2019t. \n\nSo I don\u2019t think your partner is a complete asshole, all that being said it is up to her to find a way to deal with her childhood and to stand up to this behaviour.", "Yeah I agree as I grew up with a violent drunk of a dad so I did grow up with loads of fear and high levels of self awareness which isn't a bad thing I guess. Yeah I have told her that she needs to stand up for herself as she is a very timid person which has also caused people to think she was a domestic abuse victim but she was timid from day 1. It's also a shame for my partner as she isn't in contact with any friends so her family is all that she's got so I'd hate her to fall out with her family as she'd be miserable then but occasionally her mum and step dad say and do stuff that upsets her a bit so it's a cache 22.", "NTA on this situation but dude you and your future kids deserve better. If she wants to remain a doormat and you're fine with being the bad guy of her family then that's on you guys, but your future kids will get that treatment too. Do you want your kids to be doormats to your in-laws or the hated scapegoats like you?\nI get that love is blind but seriously take a step back and look at your life for the sake of any kids you might have. Just because you two are fine with and have normalized this abuse doesn't mean your kids should. And if your partner does not want to get help to change and create boundaries then this behaviour will just continue."]}
