Backstory: she hates my husband and nothing I seem to do is satisfactory. She is/was very close to my kids - likes picking them up, talking on the phone everyday, etc. I also talked to my mother daily until this, so this last estrangement has been a doozy for me. Unbeknownst to me, my mother had been talking to my 13 year old about the 3 miscarriages I had during covid and telling her why I had no business having another baby, my mother also told my daughter she could run away to her house and that she\u2019d take me and her dad to court for child support, my mother has lied and lead my then 13 year old to believe that I am very sick, but that she can\u2019t tell me she knows because I would get upset - I am not sick. For longer than I realized, mother has been feeding my children  outright lies about me and their dad (probably a lot more than I know) that I\u2019ve starting discovered more and more over the past several months. It has now been almost 7 months with no contact - she\u2019s missed all of our birthdays and holidays and hasn\u2019t attempted to reach out once. I spoke to one of my siblings and they mentioned that my mother feels like these things just happen in life sometimes and you just have to be okay with it. I really don\u2019t know how to fix it or if I should be the one who once again tries to mend the relationship, because she never does or apologizes. My therapist says to give it more time because she has never had to fix it before. Meanwhile, my daughter has turned 14 and also went to her 1st dance and my mother didn\u2019t make contact at all, so I figure she really doesn\u2019t care either way.\n\nI only found out about all of what\u2019s been going on because a conversation of my daughter and my mother was accidentally recorded and sent to me. I couldn\u2019t even listen to it all at first - too heartbreaking. Why pretend to help and love me and hurt me at the same time?\n\nI had one conversation with my mother right after I listened the recordings and she took zero responsibility and deflected. After, I wrote her a letter expressing feelings and trying to make sense of why she\u2019d do such a thing and she responded that I was being immature and if I wanted to speak to her I need to sit down and communicate face-to-face with her and my 13 year-old daughter like a woman.\n\nI just felt like writing about some of it on here. I ask myself if I\u2019m ready to have no contact with my mother for the rest of my life \ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not, but there has to be boundaries before we can move forward and if she doesn\u2019t accept them, I guess I have no choice.

Even if they realize at some point that her words are untrue, the feelings these lies create will not just disappear when they learn the truth. \n\nIt looks like she's trying to create a situation in which she is the children's \"trusted advisor\", possibly hoping she can get them to \"cut you off\" when she does. Do not let her turn your children into \"flying monkeys\" against you.\n\nYour therapist is right. Your mother knows from experience that no matter what she does the \"cutting off\" is a punishment for you and you will eventually apologize and she can resume her behavior.\n\nI know you're not ready to have no contact with your mother for the rest of your life, but are you ready to have your relationships with your children poisoned via your relationship with your mother?

You better stay far away from your mother, and you keep your kids out of her reach.", "NTA. Why are you still trying to have a relationship with your mother? She doesn't love you and never has. She's trying to poison your kids against you, ffs! Just cut her out, once and for all. Just because someone has birthed and raised you, doesn't mean you have to have a relationship with them. You will never, ever be good enough for her no matter what you do. And if I were you, I'd specifically prohibit her from having any permission picking your kids up from school.

The fake relationships with your kids too, trying to get them to turn on you when she's not o been offering them security or..anything real...

Its all very well saying \"im not ready to cut ties\" but its clearly not just about you.\nShe cant be trusted with them, nor with you.", "NTA. I gotta admit though, it was difficult for me not to vote YTA purely for still wanting a relationship with her knowing what she's done to your family.

You must sit them down and tell them truth about everything. Show how much it hurts to be betrayed by your mother.
