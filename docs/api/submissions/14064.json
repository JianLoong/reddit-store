He didn't feel the same way. I was a lot more awkward as a kid, so I often just followed his friend groups around, even though many of them bullied me. He never stood up for me, but when we were alone he went back to being fun and nice so I always forgave him.\n\nWhen we were teenagers and got part-time jobs, I started buying him birthday and Christmas presents even though he never did the same. Our parents said it was because he's younger and would eventually, but to this day I have never received a gift from him personally. Now that we're adults, I call and text him occasionally to check in, and though he's nice when he responds, he doesn't initiate. I figured that was just how he is. I always put more work in, but he's my brother and I love him.\n\nI'm graduating from graduate school soon, and I invited my whole family out to celebrate. Everyone got a plane ticket and hotel room I'm paying for and it's been planned out for months. The other day, my brother called me to say that he was picking up a new puppy the day before my graduation and that he couldn't make it. Something inside me broke a little. I asked if it really had to be that day, if he couldn't postpone it for a week or something, but he said no dice and to cancel his reservations. I said okay and hung up. I decided I was done being in a one-way relationship with him, even though I always thought of him as my best friend.\n\nLater, I was talking to our mom and she was saying how excited she is to see us, and I told her, \"Oh, brother's not coming. He chose a dog over me.\" She asked what I was talking about, and I explained. She said she was disappointed but not surprised. Word got out and my brother called me, really hushed and sad and said what I said wasn't cool. I said I just told the truth. He called me an AH and we haven't spoken since. I said what I said in anger and bitterness, but now I'm feeling really guilty because I've always forgiven my brother and I've never heard him sound the way he did on the phone.

You literally said how you felt. That he was choosing a dog over you. Because his past actions have also proven you aren't a priority. He just feels guilty and uncomfortable.", "NTA - after getting a lifetime pass from you, you finally had your say.  Wish you had said it to him directly, but in either case he finally heard the truth.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s upset **not** because he hurt your feelings, but because he knows you recognize the imbalance in your relationship. He\u2019s also upset because other people either now see how he treated you or now \u201cpublicly\u201d acknowledge it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the following statement to be mean, I\u2019m saying it so you can see how obvious it is to a Reddit Rando who has never met you or any of your family members: Your brother is self-centered and absolutely puts his own interests above you. Even your mother acknowledges this when you told her he was not attending because he was picking up a puppy: \u201cShe said she was disappointed but not surprised.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I can imagine being on the outs with your brother hurts a lot. This is a big step in claiming the respect you deserve, and I hope you realize that and stand your ground. \n\nYou have done nothing to feel guilty about. I get that you still do feel guilty, but this outside observer absolves you of any unwarranted guilt.", "If he didn't want you telling people he backed out of your graduation festivities to get a dog, he shouldn't have backed out of your graduation festivities to get a dog.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA. The fact that you're even questioning whether you are, speaks volumes about the long-term emotional abuse you've endured from your brother. You need to cut contact with him and be done. Your brother sounds extremely toxic, callous, and cruel. You don't need someone like that in your life. And I know it's hard to hear, but he's not your *best friend*, and he never will be. He's not worth the energy, trauma, and heartache, sweetie. Just move on.", "NTA, there\u2019s no way that he planned to get the dog BEFORE knowing when graduation is. Especially since you graciously got him a FREE room. He purposefully chose to be selfish, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s on his side. He only cares that word got out, not that he hurt you, and he didn\u2019t even apologize while he was letting you down much less after.", "NTA \n\nYou just said how you felt. I haven\u2019t spoken to my brother for over 10yrs\u2026. Long story short. I hadnt seen him for 2yrs He and his wife planned a surprised trip to town, so I wasn\u2019t able to book time off work. Which meant I was unable to see them. When they were free I was working and when I was free they were busy etc. after their trip I told my mum I was disappointed they didn\u2019t make more effort to see me (or atleast give me a heads up they were coming).. brother got angry and told me not to ever talk to him again and i haven\u2019t. It\u2019s sucks but what can you do", "NTA. You just called your brother\u2019s behavior what it is, and now he\u2019s shifting his guilt onto you and trying to dodge accountability. It\u2019s unfortunate he hasn\u2019t valued your relationship all these years, and I get why you\u2019re pissed.\n\nHis behavior is inconsiderate, and I don\u2019t blame you for distancing yourself from such a one-sided relationship. All relationships should be reciprocal, and no single person should initiate all the contact.\n\n(BTW, congrats on graduating!)", "NTA - stop being your brother's doormat! It's a very uneven relationship that you've got going on here and it's not doing you any good. Take a step back and let him think about it.", "Your brother is TA. \nI\u2019m so sorry that you invested so much in your relationship with him! He doesn\u2019t deserve you", "AYTA for calling it like it is? NTA he just used that as a weak excuse to not make the effort with you", "NTA...The truth hurts sometimes.  You deserve to be treated with a little more care and consideration.", "Your  childhood hero is a selfish loser\u2026 plus your mom already knows this. Move on and continue to be a great person. Karma \u2026she knows how to wait for the right time.", "NTA. You told the truth.  It is very telling that he cares that others know how poorly he treated you but not that his actions were very hurtful to you.  This is about him and his lacking, and not you.  You 100% deserve better!", "NTA\n\nYou're stating what happened, and he's upset because it's making him feel bad that this is how you see it. Unless he's getting the puppy from a kill shelter he can wait a couple of days for something that is important to you.", "BIG Congratulations on your graduation!!! You have great things coming in your future! :)\n\nNTA. That's just so shitty. I'm so sorry.\n\nYour brother is a taker and an AH. Don't feel guilty for calling him out on his bad behavior to you. He's just upset that others can see it now.", "NTA.\n\nHe got called out for bad behavior.\n\nHopefully you find someone that supports you and values your time and friendship.", "INFO: Have you gone to therapy at all regarding your relationship with your brother? We can't possibly know all of the context of your relationship from your post, but you've described an extremely one-sided need for his approval, that seems to be some combination of him/his friends bullying you and you trying desperately to force a relationship with somebody who is very clearly trying to ice you out, and you definitely need to work through that sort of thing professionally. The \"choosing a dog over you\" is a wakeup call that something here is deeply screwed up and needs re-evaluation more than anything.", "NTA for the comment because it's true.\n\nBut. I do think your relationship with your brother is unhealthy based on what you describe. It's pretty clear that you two want to be in each other's lives a different amount and there's no easy answer to handling that. I do think you should talk to him about how one-sided things have been for so long but I also think you should back off. He's made it pretty clear with his apathy that he doesn't value your relationship as much as you do. It's unfortunate but you're setting yourself up for disappointment by expecting otherwise.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your brother is either. It\u2019s pretty bad of him to cancel after all the reservations has been made. But do you think you tried to push a relationship on him.", "Nah. \n\nIt sounds like you're hurt and he has never returned your intense attachment to him- which is his right. Inviting yourself to stuff, following his friends around unwanted, and describing yourself as his best friend aren't marks of a healthy sibling dynamic.", "NTA If your brother is offended is because he knows he is doing wrong. Your brother count to much on your good will to have a relationship with you and is taking you for granted. I think that this a good opportunity to talk about reciprocity with him.", "lol NTA, the brother is kind of an asshat.", "NTA - but if you continue to think of him and his feelings over your own your whole life, you\u2019d be TA to yourself.", "NTA. It's sad.", "NTA. But I don't think your brother is the AH either. I totally understand why you'd be frustrated and disappointed, I would be too. But adopting a pet is hard and if he puts the adoption appointment on hold, there's a very strong chance that the dog would be adopted by someone else. So he probably saw that opportunity as now or never. That said, if he had to miss your graduation trip to adopt this dog, he should have at least made it up to you by planning a trip to visit you at a different time.", "NTA and if I were you I'd take the opportunity to expand on your thoughts in an email or text. He knows you're upset about this one instance. I'd let him know it's not just the dog. That how people act shows their priorities, and you've always gotten him presents for birthdays and Christmas, and you always initiate conversation but he never responds in kind. Tell him the fact that he blew off your graduation confirms what you'd been feeling for a long time. And that you will stop trying so hard to be involved in his life, though it may be difficult for you.\n\nThis might give him the wake-up call that it's more than just deciding to adopt a dog right when you are graduating. He probably doesn't know how you are interpreting his actions and how much it bothers you. Once you do this, he will either rise to the occasion or he won't. This is giving him one last chance. Plenty of people don't appreciate what they have until they don't have it anymore.", "NTA, and that sound you heard from him was his being called out. When my father died, I tried to establish a relationship with my half brother. I made all the attempts, he didn't do anything. The last conversation we had I had asked if he wanted to get together at Christmas (my dad died on Thanksgiving). He never replied to anything and never reached out. It was then that I decided that if he didn't think enough about me to want to attempt a relationship, then all I could do is walk away, Yeah it hurt, but life is too damn short to put effort into a one sided relationship. He has shown you time after time that he has no intention of cultivating a relationship, believe him.  You can love him, but you don't owe him the right to make you feel bad.", "NTA. You told the truth and he got upset. I would recommend low contact or no contact because it seems like your brother does not care about you and you've always forgiven him and given him gifts but he has never reciprocated.", "He did choose a dog over you. He chose bullies over you. He chose never to give you a gift. You're not his sister.  You are just an afterthought.  Sorry. NTA except to yourself.", "NTA, I thought my sibling was my best friend as well until one day it literally hit me on the head that I wasn't when she knowingly hurt my feelings and didn't care. I had to take a step back, she's not my best friend and it hurt a lot more to even realize I've been spending a lot of time and energy on somebody who I consider to be the most important person in my life and I didn't register as important to them at all. At this point in time she's just a step from being an acquaintance, had been for the last 13 years. You can't force somebody to want something that you do that they don't. Wish you the best of luck.", "YTA - it sounds like you don't care for your brothers personal space and have spent most of your life inserting yourself into his plans and friend groups without any consideration to him or his friends. you need to give him space and stop pushing yourself into everything he does, its kinda creepy.", "NTA, but it's time to stop contacting your brother. At all. Ever.", "NTA. You told the truth. He's not upset that he hurt you, he's upset that you're finally calling him on his bullshit.", "NAH, it\u2019s fair that your upset he missed your graduate. But a dog is a 10+ year commitment and missing one thing to find the right dog is totally reasonable. I\u2019m sorta leaning yta because you seem to be petty about the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
