He didn't feel the same way. I was a lot more awkward as a kid, so I often just followed his friend groups around, even though many of them bullied me. He never stood up for me, but when we were alone he went back to being fun and nice so I always forgave him.\n\nWhen we were teenagers and got part-time jobs, I started buying him birthday and Christmas presents even though he never did the same. Our parents said it was because he's younger and would eventually, but to this day I have never received a gift from him personally. Now that we're adults, I call and text him occasionally to check in, and though he's nice when he responds, he doesn't initiate. I figured that was just how he is. I always put more work in, but he's my brother and I love him.\n\nI'm graduating from graduate school soon, and I invited my whole family out to celebrate. Everyone got a plane ticket and hotel room I'm paying for and it's been planned out for months. The other day, my brother called me to say that he was picking up a new puppy the day before my graduation and that he couldn't make it. Something inside me broke a little. I asked if it really had to be that day, if he couldn't postpone it for a week or something, but he said no dice and to cancel his reservations. I said okay and hung up. I decided I was done being in a one-way relationship with him, even though I always thought of him as my best friend.\n\nLater, I was talking to our mom and she was saying how excited she is to see us, and I told her, \"Oh, brother's not coming. He chose a dog over me.\" She asked what I was talking about, and I explained. She said she was disappointed but not surprised. Word got out and my brother called me, really hushed and sad and said what I said wasn't cool. I said I just told the truth. He called me an AH and we haven't spoken since. I said what I said in anger and bitterness, but now I'm feeling really guilty because I've always forgiven my brother and I've never heard him sound the way he did on the phone. AITA?\n\nSome edits because I guess I didn't explain some things properly: I didn't invite myself to parties or social events my brother got invited to with his friends. When I said I followed around his friend group, I meant sit near them on the school bus or during assemblies. My brother has a social life outside of me which I was not invited to, nor forced myself into. I did not insert myself into his friend groups, just that when there were group functions I would hover near them as opposed to being in a corner. When we were alone we acted very friendly with each other and we would hang out regularly, like playing video games together. He did agree to go to my graduation before I bought the hotel and plane tickets. I did not assume he would attend.", "created_utc": 1680711791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cpnah/aita_for_telling_people_my_brother_chose_a_dog/", "score": 3532, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even your mother acknowledges this when you told her he was not attending because he was picking up a puppy: \u201cShe said she was disappointed but not surprised.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry.

The fact that you're even questioning whether you are, speaks volumes about the long-term emotional abuse you've endured from your brother. You need to cut contact with him and be done.

He's not worth the energy, trauma, and heartache, sweetie. Just move on.", "NTA, there\u2019s no way that he planned to get the dog BEFORE knowing when graduation is. Especially since you graciously got him a FREE room. He purposefully chose to be selfish, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s on his side.

I haven\u2019t spoken to my brother for over 10yrs\u2026. Long story short. I hadnt seen him for 2yrs He and his wife planned a surprised trip to town, so I wasn\u2019t able to book time off work. Which meant I was unable to see them. When they were free I was working and when I was free they were busy etc. after their trip I told my mum I was disappointed they didn\u2019t make more effort to see me (or atleast give me a heads up they were coming).. brother got angry and told me not to ever talk to him again and i haven\u2019t.

We can't possibly know all of the context of your relationship from your post, but you've described an extremely one-sided need for his approval, that seems to be some combination of him/his friends bullying you and you trying desperately to force a relationship with somebody who is very clearly trying to ice you out, and you definitely need to work through that sort of thing professionally. The \"choosing a dog over you\" is a wakeup call that something here is deeply screwed up and needs re-evaluation more than anything.", "NTA for the comment because it's true.\n\nBut. I do think your relationship with your brother is unhealthy based on what you describe. It's pretty clear that you two want to be in each other's lives a different amount and there's no easy answer to handling that. I do think you should talk to him about how one-sided things have been for so long but I also think you should back off. He's made it pretty clear with his apathy that he doesn't value your relationship as much as you do. It's unfortunate but you're setting yourself up for disappointment by expecting otherwise.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your brother is either. It\u2019s pretty bad of him to cancel after all the reservations has been made. But do you think you tried to push a relationship on him.", "Nah. \n\nIt sounds like you're hurt and he has never returned your intense attachment to him- which is his right. Inviting yourself to stuff, following his friends around unwanted, and describing yourself as his best friend aren't marks of a healthy sibling dynamic.", "NTA If your brother is offended is because he knows he is doing wrong. Your brother count to much on your good will to have a relationship with you and is taking you for granted. I think that this a good opportunity to talk about reciprocity with him.", "lol NTA, the brother is kind of an asshat.", "NTA - but if you continue to think of him and his feelings over your own your whole life, you\u2019d be TA to yourself.", "NTA. It's sad.", "NTA. But I don't think your brother is the AH either. I totally understand why you'd be frustrated and disappointed, I would be too. But adopting a pet is hard and if he puts the adoption appointment on hold, there's a very strong chance that the dog would be adopted by someone else. So he probably saw that opportunity as now or never. That said, if he had to miss your graduation trip to adopt this dog, he should have at least made it up to you by planning a trip to visit you at a different time.", "NTA and if I were you I'd take the opportunity to expand on your thoughts in an email or text. He knows you're upset about this one instance. I'd let him know it's not just the dog. That how people act shows their priorities, and you've always gotten him presents for birthdays and Christmas, and you always initiate conversation but he never responds in kind. Tell him the fact that he blew off your graduation confirms what you'd been feeling for a long time. And that you will stop trying so hard to be involved in his life, though it may be difficult for you.\n\nThis might give him the wake-up call that it's more than just deciding to adopt a dog right when you are graduating. He probably doesn't know how you are interpreting his actions and how much it bothers you. Once you do this, he will either rise to the occasion or he won't. This is giving him one last chance. Plenty of people don't appreciate what they have until they don't have it anymore.", "NTA, and that sound you heard from him was his being called out. When my father died, I tried to establish a relationship with my half brother. I made all the attempts, he didn't do anything. The last conversation we had I had asked if he wanted to get together at Christmas (my dad died on Thanksgiving). He never replied to anything and never reached out. It was then that I decided that if he didn't think enough about me to want to attempt a relationship, then all I could do is walk away, Yeah it hurt, but life is too damn short to put effort into a one sided relationship. He has shown you time after time that he has no intention of cultivating a relationship, believe him.  You can love him, but you don't owe him the right to make you feel bad.", "NTA. You told the truth and he got upset. I would recommend low contact or no contact because it seems like your brother does not care about you and you've always forgiven him and given him gifts but he has never reciprocated.", "He did choose a dog over you. He chose bullies over you. He chose never to give you a gift. You're not his sister.  You are just an afterthought.  Sorry. NTA except to yourself.", "NTA, I thought my sibling was my best friend as well until one day it literally hit me on the head that I wasn't when she knowingly hurt my feelings and didn't care. I had to take a step back, she's not my best friend and it hurt a lot more to even realize I've been spending a lot of time and energy on somebody who I consider to be the most important person in my life and I didn't register as important to them at all. At this point in time she's just a step from being an acquaintance, had been for the last 13 years. You can't force somebody to want something that you do that they don't. Wish you the best of luck.", "YTA - it sounds like you don't care for your brothers personal space and have spent most of your life inserting yourself into his plans and friend groups without any consideration to him or his friends. you need to give him space and stop pushing yourself into everything he does, its kinda creepy.", "NTA, but it's time to stop contacting your brother. At all. Ever.", "NTA. You told the truth. He's not upset that he hurt you, he's upset that you're finally calling him on his bullshit.", "NAH, it\u2019s fair that your upset he missed your graduate.

It's a bit unusual for an older sister to be bffs with their younger brother (sure some siblings are very compatible and close, but a lot aren't) and to be a part of their friend group, particularly when it seems those friends weren't always on board with including you. That puts little brother in an awkward position of choosing between peers and sibling and its understandable that he might have wanted to have his own peer group and not always include his older sibling but failed at setting boundaries. And while he may have loved you he might not have liked hanging out with you so much. I'm wondering where your parents were in all of this when you were growing up: were they pushing to have you two do everything together, so he got resentful of always being told to include his sister? Did they ever try to help you both establish some healthy space?

Your parents should have definitely intervened. To help guide you through these struggles as a child - and help mediate appropriate time between their children. But as an adult - you should definitely be seeking assistance in dealing with these feelings with a professional. Whether that's a psychologist or at the least school hired counselor. \n\nBack to your brother and his puppy - to say that he's flat out choosing a dog over you may be a bit harsh. He's an adult living his own life with his own responsibilities and plans. While he definitely should have made his unavailability public to yourself and those of your family attending much more in advance - indeed making him an AH - stuff happens. \n\nFor the situation at hand - **ESH in their own ways.**\n\nCongratulations on your graduation - Have a great time. Make memories. **Your brother has made his choices. You don't need him to be happy.**", "I mean no disrespect when I say this; but is he your brother or a real-life doll you shove love into?", "I\u2019m curious to know why you thought he was your best friend\u2026..I\u2019m wondering did you have any friends growing up besides him to compare?", "I don't envy you or your brother. It's not nice that he cancelled, but your relationship also doesn't sound very healthy.", "NTA for what you said, but possibly for your persistence growing up, especially being the big sister. I can see it creating resentment in him to where he wouldn't want to see you and use a dog as a scape goat.", "Yta. Let me explain - you were an overbearing awkward sibling. It was probably embarrassing for him and he was tired of it. Please get a social life.", "I say this with kindness - YTA.  You have a bit of a sense of entitlement regarding your relationship with your brother, and this isn't fair to him (or to you.) He didn't choose to be part of the family, and he isn't required to be close to you just because you need companionship.  Me and my brother always had a rough relationship with our older sister because she consistently expected so much of us, thought we were born to be her friend, and thus she was constantly disappointed in us for not \"fulfilling our role as her little siblings.\" Long story short  we are all adults now and we have very limited contact with her because it is just miserable to be around someone who is in a constant fantasy about what the relationship is \"supposed to be.\" \n\nI think it would be great if you can let go of some expectations regarding family roles and maybe go to therapy and talk through how you can build a more healthy, mutual relationship with another person.", "Nah. I can't really call either of you an asshole because it seems like you forced yourself on a relationship that wasn't happening.  He kind of made it clear he didn't want you around.", "NTA\n\nKinda sounds like he doesn\u2019t like you though. From letting you get bullied to never contacting you, etc. \n\nTO ME it seems like you might\u2019ve tried overly hard to be his friend and he might not have liked that, so now he kinda doesn\u2019t have much to do with you. Which tbh I think is truly sad but\u2026 that\u2019s life I guess.", "NTA. You saw him as a friend. He saw you as a distant relative. Polite but nothing more. So he has no right to be upset when he decided to ditch your graduation to get a dog. If he didn't want to go, he should have told you before you bought tickets. It might be better to go LC for a while and use this time to make friends with people who want to be your friend.", "NTA. That\u2019s exactly what happened and someone besides you called him out on it. Don\u2019t apologize. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He literally chose a dog over your graduation. Call it as it is and don\u2019t continue to be his door mat.", "Here\u2019s the thing. Your bro doesn\u2019t owe you presents or being your best friend. You said it was one sided, you have to accept that. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t get to be honest about it. He really does care more about a dog than you. If he\u2019s going to act like that, he needs to own it because he certainly hasn\u2019t earned a \u201cgood brother\u201d badge. NTA", "NTA, you spoke the truth and he's upset because he doesn't want to acknowledge that he's an ah. He knew you reserved a room and plane ticket and still chose to schedule that date to get a puppy. Don't feel guilty, just move on and surround yourself with friends who value you.", "NTA. Growing up, you were always the older brother but as you got older, that difference became less and less. At this point, the onus shouldn't be on you to always make the effort. At some point, the relationship should have balanced out so that you are more equals. \n\nHe was probably hurt because you called him out, something you've never done before. But it's understandable that you were hurt by this. There is no reason why you shouldn't have let him know that you were hurt. \n\nIt's time he stepped up to show up in your life.", "Nta.\nYour brother choosed his priorities", "Technically NTA But your relationship with him is really unhealthy. He wasn't your best friend he was your obsession. You need to talk to a therapist about this and give him space.", "NTA.  Firstly, congrats on graduation and being in a position to fund your family coming and sharing in this great achievement.   You sought of had a feeling it was one way, and now its clear and he knows he's been spotted as the AH and as any AH will do in this situation is try and shift blame to you.  In what world do you have an excuse of picking up a new puppy (and I love dogs btw) instead of being with family on this celebratory occasion.  LAME!!!!", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't actually give a shit about you. He's just salty that this time, there are consequences for him. Which he would like to punish you for making him feel.\n\nBe super clear that this is on him to do the heavy lifting of fixing. He broke it: he puts in the effort or it's staying broken. After he fixes it (if he bothers) tell him exactly what you expect from here on out reciprocal effort and initiative, or you're out.", "NTA", "NTA, and it's depressing that you even had to ask. You have every right to be upset with your brother and you have every right to tell people he chose a dog over you. Because he did.", "NTA, by what right does he have to call you an AH? He *DID* choose a dog over you. It's not a matter of polite phrasing, it's the literal reality.", "I\u2019m sorry your brother sucks. NTA!", "Sometimes the truth hurts.", "NTA. He\u2019s only upset because you told other people. He\u2019s never cared about you or your feelings. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA. You've never called him out on his bad behavior before, so that's why you've never heard him sound that way before. \n\nWhat you said was true, and a really important turning point for you. A best friend doesn't let people bully you, or only show you kindness where no one else can see it. A best friend doesn't blow off your huge milestones lightly, and they don't take over and over without giving. Your brother is not your best friend. He is your realative and a fairly distant one, at that.\n\nCongratulations on all you have accomplished. Go out and enjoy your life, and fill it with caring, loving people who know and show how wonderful are.", "NTA but maybe take distance stop buying him gift,calling or texting. Treat him how he has treated you. See how he likes it", "NTA\n\n1. He could've picked the dog ANY other day, especially when he knew it was your graduation day. \n\n2. The upset tone and expression is all a trick to make you feel guilty. And its working.\n\n3. He effed up and he's upset because now everyone knows how he treats his sister :)", "My brother and I were really close until he met his wife then I no longer existed. Off and on the last 18 years they pop in and out of our life where we see them every week then they disappear for over a year. Other than a text on my bday and Christmas stone silence. Recently one of my dogs passed away one that his wife and him claimed to adore. I didn\u2019t think he knew until I realized he was on one of my social media accounts. Now I\u2019ve cut all ties and have said unless he is sick and dying or dead I don\u2019t want to hear anything about him. Your brother doesn\u2019t give a damn about you stop wasting your time with him. NTA he is.", "NTA. Don't feel guilty. I hope you will take good care of yourself to heal from the pain of not being loved by your brother. You should go no contact with him. Focus on your relationship with your mom. Also, try to find new friends by joining some groups that share your interests, like MeetUps.", "NTA, you told it how it is, if he doesn\u2019t like how he looks in the tale, that\u2019s his problem", "NTA. He sounded like that because he got caught. He doesn't feel bad about how he treated you, he feels bad because everyone knows it, now.", "NTA you only stated the facts.  If he\u2019s mad that people are seeing his choice that way, too bad. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, it\u2019s hard when love like that is not reciprocated. \nCongrats on your graduation!", "NTA for saying the truth, but I wonder if you're letting out some info.  \nI dont see why he would just resent you for following him around.  \nDid you hurt him in the past? \nDid you said something to him? Or is it just unjustified resentment from his side???  \nIdk, is just i can't believe someone would be that selfish without a grounded reason.  \nMaybe im just wrong, and I just have to admit the fact that \"some people suck\".", "NTA - you told the truth and that\u2019s that. he did domthat and he should\u2018n\u2019t be twisted out of shape when other\u2019s find out.   \n\n\nBut the kicker is your brother is not your best friend, in fact he barely cares at all beyond superficially. Which is a bit sad but happens in life all the time. He\u2019s allowed to choose the degree of closeness he fells comfortable with, and it\u2019s clear the answer is not very close. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n I\u2019m sorry for you but you will need to move on and find genuine deep friendship relationships with people who care about you as you are. Stop trying to force your way into your brother\u2019s affections, just send a card for birthdays and christmas and that\u2019s it.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is an asshat. He couldn't give a shot about you. You keep believing in a fairytale brother (which is nice) but its not this guy", "NTA. He didn\u2019t like your choice of words because it very plainly describes what he did and casts him in an unfavorable light. It wouldn\u2019t have killed him to wait. Choices have consequences. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, my own father didn\u2019t show up to my undergrad graduation (I was the first one in the family to graduate) and my mom didn\u2019t offer me a \u201cparty\u201d until it was waaaaaay too late. My mom, sister, godfather, and cousin came to my graduation and I went out with friends that night to celebrate. Eff everyone and do what makes you happy.", "NTA.", "NTA -  He bullied you then...he is bullying you now.  sorry, but he's just not that into you. Your comment was completely fair.", "Honestly nta. If he loved you he would at least try to show it.", "NTA\n\nMy god, that took you a long time.\n\nToo bad the truth is only a temporary hurt for him.", "NTA. You need to end this depenancy on him. He doesn't show it back.", "Definitely NTA here. I would echo some of what others are saying. Your brother never saw you, based on what you're saying, as his best friend. If he chose to pick up the new puppy that day, he chose not to go to your graduation because of the puppy. This is a huge deal, as it should be. You need to talk to your therapist about this because you should not feel at all guilty. You don't have to be mean if you speak to him, but just plainly say, \"This was a big deal to me. It was important that you be there, and you chose to pick up a puppy the day before so you couldn't come. And that makes me feel as if I'm not important to you.\"", "This is that painful and confusing thing where you learn your new boundaries. Best advice I can give, is lean into it. Self love is super important. Hard to learn but the best thing you can ever do for yourself.", "NTA. Your brother sounds like a dick, and I think you're going to be disappointed by him as long as you keep expecting things from him.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  You are obviously a sentimental and family-oriented person.  It's a harsh world for people who are.  Your brother lacks those traits.  Seriously, let him go, and let him stay there.\n\nYou've accomplished so much and should be very proud of your degree.  You're going to meet people who want you in their lives and appreciate you, I promise.\n\nEdited to add:  please do not pay for any more trips or really anything else for him.", "NTA. And I'm glad you're finally getting that your relationship is one sided and you are standing up for yourself. \n\nThough, to be fair, this is not your highschool or bachelor degree graduation; I think a party for graduate school is definitely something skipable, and I don't really blame him for not wanting to do a bunch of traveling for it.", "NTA. Move on without him. He is not your best friend.", " NTA and I think he needed to what the harsh words!! Is ould of said the same thing to a sibling in the same situation. \n\nCongratulations on your graduation and enjoy your day with the people that want to be there to celebrate your accomplishments!!", "NTA. Your brother has treated you poorly your entire life. Congratulations on quitting being his doormat.", "NTA, and your brother sounded as he did because he did not like finally being held accountable for his actions.", "NTA", "NTA. If he doesn't want people thinking he chose a dog over his sister, then he shouldn't choose a dog over his sister. I'm sorry, OP.", "NTA\n\nYou pretty much told the truth. He was getting a dog rather than coming. What is his problem with that?", "NTA He's guilt-tripping you with a sad voice and you're falling for his trick. Again, as you already did your whole life. If someone's only nice to you when this someone is alone with you, but doesn't have your back when you're bullied - this person is neither a brother, nor a friend. Your brother was an AH and a coward. Cut him off and find real friends.", "NTA. I hate to see people idolise their family members when they couldn't give 2 shits about them. By the sounds of it, you're better off without him. I know it's hard, and you love your brother, but he has chosen a new pet over you. \n\nHe doesn't deserve to see you graduate after treating you like shit all these years.", "NTA, you told the truth and now he has to live with the consequences of his actions. He could easily have changed the date of picking up the Puppy, hell he shouldn't have arranged that date in the first place, seeing as your graduation was planned for months.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your brother has taken you for granted all his life. Its not about to change and all you can do is accept this and make a real best friend.", "NTA Your brother has been hurting you over the years and you finally spoke up. Congratulations on your graduation!", "NTA - don't feel guilty, learn from it and move on. He said what he said and unless you twisted the explanation to your mother I don't think you were in the wrong.  Congratulations on your upcoming graduation.  Enjoy your time with the rest of your family who can make it.", "NTA. I'm glad you decided to be done with this one sided relationship. It reminds me of the kind of relationship my brother and I have", "NTA I love dogs as much as the next person but he can always just wait to get the dog. Seems like the sibling relationship you guys have is one sided, he appears very selfish. Congrats on your graduation", "NTA - But, you are kind of slow. Your brother is not your best friend, and if you think he is, then you need new friends. He shown you what he is - and he's shown you over and over - and he might even get an ego kick out of thinking he can just do whatever he wants and you'll go along. Stop playing that game. Be civil and get along, but forget the gifts and the pretense of your relationship being a close friendship. And...for crying out loud...let this teach you a lesson in valuing yourself. No one is perfect, but believe what people show you about them because you deserve better.", "NTA, however, some rescues have very specific dates that you have to get your pet. My family had to be on call for 2 days because they had delays, in order to pick up the animal at a very specific time, or sucks for you, no pet, so it is very possible that he could not go for that reason. I also was the sibling that was stuck with my sibling all of the time. I adore my sister, bit I hated spending time with her during school for a long time because of it. I'm not saying the behavior is OK, rather, OP should have realized that they never had a real friendship during school, since brother did bully OP, a lot, and even recognized that he did and apologized", "NTA, OP, my heart breaks for you. My siblings are my best friends, but we all reciprocate it. Your kind and forgiving nature let him walk all over you. If he decides to apologize, then make it very clear how you expect to be treated. Do not waste any more time on him. If he wants the relationship, he has to work for it. Even said out of anger, ask, was it true? You didn't say it to hurt him. You said it because you were hurting. I'm glad your mom backed you up. Also, congrats on graduation.", "NTA he is manipulating you he knows you will forgive him and not to anything for you becouse you always will give him everything\n\nIt's time to have boundaries and wake up. Relationships are not one way.\n\nHe choose to pick up the dog and not celebrate with you. Read again he choose to do something else instead of being with you in your special day.", "I am a dog person through and through. And will usually side with whichever side has more dogs. \n\nIn this case, though, **NTA**. Brother should have planned his picking up a puppy around big events. Some adoption places are strict, for sure, but he should have factored that in to his scheduling.", "I postponed getting my puppy (now 2 y/o dog) by two days because my friend was having her birthday in the middle of quarantine and I had planned a virtual get-together with a bunch of our friends.\n\nNTA. I hope you have better friends and family to lean on and are proud of you.", "NTA for the question you asked.\n\nhowever...your brother never indicated he wants you to be part of his friend group and such. and thats ok. its also ok if he doesnt want to have a relationship with you, and quite honestly i cant quite blame him for it cos it sounds like you were forcing yourself on him way too much and it is exhausting.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry but I would limit my contact with him for your own mental health.", "NTA.\nYour feelings are your own but obviously your brother doesn't see you as his best friend. Now that's fine, we all have our own path to walk, but it doesn't mean you have to be there, looking out for him at all turns. He is upset because he got called out for his behaviour, not your behaviour.\nI have friends that are as close as my family I have the best relationships with and, I have family that I would not be friends with (or have anything to do with) if they were not related.\nEnjoy your day with your family and real friends, put your life and happiness first and enjoy your life.", "NTA.

Most dog breeders would rather everyone picks up the puppies on the same day so no dogs get left behind for a day (or in this case a week) it happened when I was getting my dog, so I had to miss out on a Christmas Eve party so even if he did want to go I don\u2019t think he could have due to the breeder not wanting one of the puppies left behind with no company for a week", "NTA. you are better off. f your selfish brother", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t want anybody to know what an asshole he is dropping his brother\u2019s important event for a fucking dog.\n\nI love pets, but this beyond ridiculous. And clearly he doesn\u2019t give a shit about you. Don\u2019t be his doormat anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s time people saw him for who he really is. Now it\u2019s public. You did nothing wrong by telling it like it is.", "NTA, he\u2019s only upset because he thinks he looks bad to your family/ his friends. He\u2019s not upset because he hurt you. You should just go no contact with him. He\u2019s shown where his loyalties lie", "He isn't choosing the dog over you, because he could have boarded the dog or picked the dog up after graduation. Your brother is choosing himself and his pleasure over creating new family memories. \n\nThis is not a reflection of your worthiness. He is a narcissistic AH. \n\nIt's okay to quietly withdraw, without further drama, from this relationship to the same degree as him. Attend family events and give him a half-hearted \"hey\" when you see him and find something else to do.", "NTA - your brother had been a AH for years. He\u2019s finally been called out a bit for being an AH and doesn\u2019t like it. Stay strong.

You said the truth of the situation, you are open and vulnerable about how you really feel, and I want you to be proud of that. \n\nWhat I see from you is love for your brother and disappointment that he doesn\u2019t return those feelings in the way you want. I want you to keep in mind you cannot control or force your brother to feel or be a certain way. The sooner you accept who he is and let go of achieving any outcome, the sooner you will feel lighter and happier that this weight has lifted from you. Any resentment you have towards him you can take accountability for. At every turn, catch yourself on how you feel. Forgive him for what he cannot give.", "NTA I have this too.  I have a sib I love greatly, but I am not who she wants.  I do not chase her, I match energy with her.  It is better.  I use that love for my friends.  You have so much heart, give it to people who want it and will love you back.

Your brother has alot of growing up to do.... live your best life sir!", "He knows you and assumed you would not\nSay anything. He should not have backed out.", "NTA", "NAH - you spent your childhood doing what was best for you, inserting yourself into his friendships and allowing yourself to be mocked rather than walking away because even being mocked was preferable to being alone. It is unlikely he never took stick for it himself and he could have had a go at you about it and told you in no uncertain terms to leave him alone, but he didn't. He maybe didn't stand up for you to his friends, but there is a good chance he held himself back plenty. You mum said she is not surprised, so she is probably very aware of his feelings as well as yours. I hope that your graduation a self-esteem boost and that this situation has provided you with the awareness required to carve your own way without needing him there as a comfort blanket.\nHe is now doing what is best for him, forging his own little companionship and putting space between you and him, letting himself have something that is his, no sharing required. Chances are he isn't putting the dog before you, he is putting himself before you.\nI'm sorry OP, there was never going to be a moment that this realisation wouldn't hurt. It's not that unusual for parents to build their families on this premise of friendship: \"Oh I am going to have babies close together so they will be little besties!\" and then force the relationship by constantly reinforcing how \"you're best friends\" no matter how unpleasant you might be to each other (leading to constant forgiveness, even when it is undeserved). And every adult in your life growing up will have no doubt remarked at some point how lovely it must be to be so close with your brother. Some siblings try to force the relationship that they have been told they should have, some drift as far from it as they can. He is your brother and hopefully one day might be your friend, but you are enough - good enough, interesting enough, clever enough, funny enough, just 100% ENOUGH - as an individual to find your own best friend instead of trying to hold onto one that never chose you.", "NTA because that\u2019s literally what he did.

Neither of my brothers would do this. I think you need to stop trying and don\u2019t apologise - say that actions speak louder than words and he clearly chose a dog over you, and it wouldn\u2019t kill him to put in just a little bit of effort for you, like you\u2019ve done for him all your life.", "Just go nc with him and block him one day he will need to contact you", "Nta queen. I'm not saying you go NC, but you should def not back down on this. He DID did you dirty. He could've picked the puppy up later, or at least leave it with an acquaintance. This wasn't some random party, it was your goddamn GRAD SCHOOL GRADUATION (btw, congrats, getting a PhD sounds really hard and I hope you're proud of yourself).\nIf he complains again about it, remind him that he textually told you he had to pick up a dog and wouldn't go because of that. Also, as a personal recommendation, stop being the one who initiates conversation; it's a little thing, but a little thing that enables him onto feeling he doesn't have to put effort onto having a relationship with you.", "NTA in the least. Your brother, on the other hand, is a huge AH and I'm so sorry. That stings. \n\nCongrats on your graduation!! Huge accomplishment!", "NTA He's upset because he's being told what he is doing is being stupid and that HES TAH so instead of self reflection and seeing how and why your upset he does what most people do and blame somebody else and tells them to shut up, if it was you and ONLY YOU saying he's TAH then you would have to rethink your stance now if there's like 3-5 family members (or more) saying he's TAH then y'all can't be wrong.", "NTA.  It would be nice if he could move it a few days or arrange someone to watch the puppy while he's gone, if he has any willing friends.  He doesn't seem to want to, and you causing a stink won't make him more willing.  If anything, it will push him further from you than he already is.  I can't really tell what happened here.  For whatever reason, he never put in what you have.  I'd have a talk with him one day and ask why that is.  You keep pushing a relationship he never wanted.  If I were you, I'd just be done with him.  I'd stop forcing myself into someone's life who just has shown for years they don't care.  Maybe If he shares what the real issue has been this whole time, maybe you guys can actually have a chance. Something obviously has been bothering him for a long time.", "NTA but when will you stop forgiving you brother?  It's been a decade plus of him ignoring you and taking you for granted.  Essentially you've trained him to not care.  Which he doesn't.  Move on.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s time to start living your life. Stop reaching out to your brother and stop expecting him to reach out to you. \nY\u2019all are now adults. Do you.", "Going against the grain here, ESH. People need to find out the whole story, and OP needs to think before they say stuff that might have consequences. It sounds like the relationship is strained. The brother can make an effort to be better.", "NTA. Been there, and it sucks. IDK if you were also shoehorned into the neuroses-inducing \"responsible older sister who watches out for her younger siblings\" role, but I know from experience that younger brothers can look at that role with jealousy and/or resentment of having another observer/ parent in their life. It sucks because you get the short ends of both sticks in terms of doing more work and being resented and unappreciated for it. Anyways, there's no wrong time to deconstruct that dynamic, and please set aside the guilt of \"failing\" your brother. Unfortunately your role is to be the bad guy no matter what you choose, so you might as well choose your own needs.", "NTA. I'd dream to have a sibling like you OP. I'm always the one people turn to for help but never bothering checking on. Most family members remember me when they need a favor (if not money).\n\nYour brother is a narc.

If the whole family is attending the graduation, they are obviously at least somewhat close.

The brother says \u201cit\u2019s not cool that you said that\u201d about choosing the dog over her graduation. It doesn\u2019t sound like he offered much more of an explanation before hanging up the phone. If that wasn\u2019t true, if there wasn\u2019t something else, why not share it?

It doesn\u2019t really matter if your brother wants a close relationship or a more superficial one, in fact attending major events and not seeing/speaking much outside of that is what most families consider being \u201cnot very close but still supportive). But that aside, he told you what he told you and didn\u2019t offer a different explanation when he got caught and you parents stepped in/called him out. It\u2019s not your job to read into what he said anymore than how he presented it. Re-evaluating relationships can be super hard, so let yourself grieve what you felt was there before.

No, I loved (and love) him dearly, but felt he was beneath me at that age and no pubescent boy 2 years younger than me is going to talk down to teen me.  like no HS junior needs social capital from a middle schooler. And who cares what they were doing, our interests were not aligned in any way.   \n\n\nAs we grew up and the age gap was not such a big deal in terms of interests and maturity levels, I did become good friends with many of his friends, even some of the little twerps ;-) from when we were growing up. Because we did have genuine fun together and interests in common at that point. It sounds like you\u2019ve never really gotten there with him on his own, let alone with his friends.

Unfortunately you can't force relationships, and trying to force relationships rarely has the result that people desire.

At the same time though, you were *choosing* to believe something you had zero evidence for. Instead of talking about the problem, you wanted to pretend there weren't any. Now you're upset and angry because the illusion just couldn't take any more under the weight of all that reality, and now you're blaming him.\n\nIts sad and fucked up from just about every angle there is...", "You come across as a stalker of your brother since childhood - hanging out with him and his friends cause you never had your own, considering him your \u201cbest friend\u201d when he never did and giving him presents while he never reciprocated. Is this relationship all in your head ? You needed a wake up call like 15 years ago. Gentle YTA", "OP, you literally describe a relationship where he never seemed to return much of your affection and seemed embarrassed of you in front of his friends.\n\nThat is not a best friend or even a good friend.\n\nEven though you may be overly clingy to him, he has also benefited from the fact you have acted like a doormat every time before now for forgiving him when he didn't reciprocate in gifts or let his friends be cruel to you in that he never faced social repercussions from you when he treated you badly, thoughtlessly or didn't offer care or support. He likely expected you would just forgive him again and life would continue on.\n\nLike yeah he is likely sad and he should feel that way. He chose to get a puppy over seeing you and celebrating with you. He knew this was happening months in advance. People will think poorly of someone who does that to their sibling that clearly loves them and wants a good relationship.\n\nYour dynamic may have been dysfunctional and needed work, but there is this thing called communication that he could have tried, didn't, and is now getting consequences for his lack of effort in your relationship. That isn't you being an AH. That is him actually being held accountable for his choices and not liking it because you let him get away with everything else ever before and he also feels like 'the victim' because you were overly clingy. \n\nBut he isn't, you've both hurt each other because your dynamic was dysfunctional and unhealthy.", "Bouncing on here to reiterate NTA. I hope you do address this. Many of us are on here are proud of you for graduating internet stranger, so take that for what it's worth.

Don't fret, this is %100 completely on him, and if you did have a big social circle or are connected to other family on social media, if you post graduation pictures don't you dare feel a bit of guilt and you make sure to caption that he's missing due to deciding to adopt a dog and that he made you cancel the tickets you bought. Call him out, he deserves it. He could have just declined to go in the first place, but he didn't want your mom having that much time to nag him. That's between the two of them. The hurt he caused is between the two of you, and if you want to put the info out there that's perfectly fine, it's a puppy, not a sensitive surgery.

That definitely comes across as manipulative.\n\nAlso, your brother isn\u2019t even doing anything wrong. He had his commitment to his dog before he was invited to your graduation. Adopting a dog involves a lot of time, money, and research, and it sounds like if he didn\u2019t go pick up the dog it would be given to someone else. You would be asking him to toss away all his prior investment (any deposit he had on the dog, any emotional excitement at preparing to pick up the dog). Whereas you can still support someone\u2019s graduation without being there. Even if you were close I would say it\u2019s unfortunate but reasonable that he has to miss it to adopt his dog.

My mom would take him on trips with us, he\u2019d stay the night at my house for multiple days a week, etc. He would still bully me with little comments here and there about how I was slow, or dumb or whatever, things always had to be done his way, and I always paid when buying munchies at the corner store.\n\nI didn\u2019t notice how imbalanced this relationship was until I was over 20, and went years without him ever reaching out to me, even though I tried to keep contact.

I want to let you know this is a big accomplishment. \n\nMy sister and I used to be close and then grew apart as we both went through the worst of teenager angst in close succession. \n\nAnd there was a point where my sister, who is younger, was often not initiating or holding our relationship over my head in more of a cat and mouse game. She did get me birthday and holiday presents but for a long time would throw mistakes I made in childhood in my face or be wishy washy with me about plans.

I have a brother two years younger who I\u2019ve always got along great with.

We all had and continue to have great times, but there were always boundaries. He knew he was generally welcome with those friends but when I did stuff with other friends he never tried to insinuate himself into our activities. He also wasn\u2019t always invited when the group he was also a part of did stuff if the natural divide of age and interests intervened. \nThe key part of this is it was something we both wanted and there were boundaries.

It\u2019s clear his doesn\u2019t want to jump on a plane for a few days to sit in a 4 hour long ceremony for someone he\u2019s never been close with, and that is absolutely his right.", "Read OPs comments, she asked him if he is coming so that she could book a room for him and he said YES and LATER he said he couldn't make it after all.\n\nAnd she is not telling **people**, she told **one person**", "Where did it say he rsvp\u2019d no? All I read was that he agreed to attend and THEN she bought is plane ticket and hotel room.", "That\u2019s actually exactly what it is from her post and comments.", "She told her **mom** \n\nShe did not guilt him\n\nShe did not start telling everyone in the family \n\nShe just said ok to him and made a bitter comment to her mom", ">How much he probably hated the feeling of obligation you get when someone you don't like gets you a gift and clearly expects you to reciprocate or at least perform a lot of gratitude.  \n>  \n>The guy does not and never has wanted a deep relationship with her, and I understand why.\n\nAll of this is extreme projection on the part of the above user, and that's who I was responding to. They're making up a lot of stuff.", "pruposefully naive? yeah i can see that. but all the stuff in your first half of the post, honestly i dont see how that can be OPs fault. she was a kid at the time, you dont realise that kinda stuff until youre older, im sure youve been in a situation as a child when you were trying to fit into a group despite them not respecting you. its how you learn to make friends as a kid, and unfortunately OP didnt have any other options other than her brothers friend group, so she stuck to them. the parents shouldve stepped in and corrected this at the time, if anything.", "again, she mentioned multiple times how shes always done stuff for him but hes never thought about her in the same way. its all written there. and wdym \"weird\", its weird to care about a family member? what OP needs to work on is letting the brother go, she already knows everything else. and letting go is very easy once you realise to yourself that theyre just not meant to be in your life. it would be harder to let go if you were blind to your situation, which OP clearly isnt.", "He's responsible for making his boundaries known to her though. He hasn't communicated them to her which allowed the illusion of a relationship to go on. Maybe he liked the gifts and attention he received without having to reciprocrate. He's upset now, not because his boundary was violated but because the one sidedness of their interaction has been perceived.", "She didn\u2019t force one.", "It's not that you are responding, it's just that you keep taking everything to the extreme. Like, OP didn't just tell her mom what happened she \"tattled\" and apparently has trouble accepting no for an answer. \n\nIt's just weird that you're taking such a hard stance against her.", "She said how she felt. \n\nI need to be evaluated for thinking that venting to your mother is okay? You\u2019re taking this a bit too personally over people you don\u2019t know.", ">How else would she frame it? It seems to me like what she said was pretty accurate.\n\n\"Brother is not coming, he is picking up his new puppy.\" - simple, factual \n\n\"Brother chose a dog over me.\" - unnecessarily dramatic, especially considering they never had a close relationship, OP's brother's behaviour never showed he cares that much about OP", "To be fair, your comment was also almost entirely projection, you just projected the opposite onto him, and then doubled down, insisting it is mostly because of thoughtlessness and laziness, when there are any number of reasonable motives, all of which, again, are very well documented.", "There are also many reasons why someone may not be able to communicate their boundaries too, many of which we wouldn't know because the OP never told us.\n\nLike, as an example, I'm autistic. I have a very very hard time reciprocating or initiating conversations with even family members. I CRAVE that interaction, but I constantly feel like if I contact them, I'm bothering them. And then my lack of social skills kick in and I may have issues reading their vocal or behavioral queues and assume how they feel, which puts me further into the spot of not being able to do the above. I have gone over 2-3 YEARS without contacting family members, dispite near-daily hovering over a facebook message or a text screen to contact them, then deciding not to because I'm too anxious with how they'll react.\n\nNow that I'm in my early 40's, and in constant therapy, I've been more able to communicate boundaries and initiate conversation, but it is still very hard for me. At 26? I wouldn't have been able to do that AT ALL. \n\nAnd to be honest? I have actually ditched my sister to get a dog instead of going to her college graduation myself in the same way the op's brother did. Why? Because I have such massive anxiety and fear that happens in large group settings that it is horrible for me, and I was getting my first-ever Therapy dog a few days before. With THAT said, I was also local to her so it wasn't an issue of me going or not going, but I rather would spend that day bonding with my new dog than freak myself out in a large stadium listening to loud voices. Guess what? My sister understood, and came to my place after to share pictures with me, and we ended up having takeout and watching a movie instead. \n\nI really don't think we can judge the op without knowing a bit more tbh.", "She kept orbiting around her brother and his friends, even when they were obviously rejecting her and shunning her out, what would you call that then?", "She didn\u2019t call to tattle. Her mother was excited to see both her kids, and she told her mum her son had changed his mind and decided to get a dog that day instead.", "People probably would still think he was an asshole to be honest, if I told people my brother couldn't go to my GRADUATION because they went to pick up something which could be picked up any other day (which he likely scheduled after he already agreed to go to op's event) people would internally be like \"oh, so he just didn't want to go\".\n\nPriorities matter, if she didn't give details others would still ask what was so important he couldn't go to a paid retreat?, probably in concern only to then be like \"oh, that was all? Pfff\".", "Cut her some slack, she was just venting to her mom\n\nEdit: and in her mind, they did have a close relationship, I'd be disappointed too", "Did you read her post and comments?"]}
